prodigy this is a completely unique case
from BitFenix that they believe is going
to turn the ITX gaming system segment
completely upside down not up sights
like some other boards not upside down
or anything like not let the basic point
is that they are expecting this to just
change the way the game is played when
it comes to small form-factor yet very
powerful very capable machines so the
first thing we're going to see when we
open it up is a quick installation guide
actually oh sorry sorry
external packaging so there's not a
whole lot going on over here other than
some shipping labels and like Kemah tool
free design BitFenix uber flex uper what
does that say fiber flex it's like it
doesn't say pure I wasn't sure what it
said no like look at it what am I
supposed to think that says right ah
anyway I was a little taken aback by
that but it looks like it's all good
fiber flex soft touch surface treatment
supports long graphics cars and up to
240 millimeter water cooling radiators
which we happen to have what did I do
with in here just which we happen to
have one of right here so we can take a
look at how that's going to fit inside
flex Kage hard disk rack to a free
design and nothing that looks like just
a line to help you figure out where to
put the sticks all right so right so we
found a little manual inside then we
find the case itself got a 15 a global
going on here let's flip it upside down
and get her out I'm actually really
really excited to see this case because
they've done a lot of things with it
that are incredibly unique and I it's
just one of those things like I actually
built myself in a silverstone sgo 1vw
Oh a long time ago
myself a triple water pool a triple
radiator water cooled system at one of
those just because I'm not a bit of a
thing for like small systems I think
they're I think they're adorable
and I think they're awesome so figuring
out creative ways to put more hardware
in less space definitely floats my boat
so I really want to see this in person
all right so let's have a look at the
general aesthetic I mean the first thing
that there is to kind of notice about it
is it's kind of like a it kind of looks
like a like a Mac Pro with the whole
like handle thing going on on the top
and the bottom also I specifically asked
to to check out the white version
because I thought that that would be
sort of sort of more more more Mac like
I'm thinking we might do a hackintosh
guide at some point on NCIX tech tips
although we might just do like an
extreme gaming build within a small
form-factor case not really sure what
route we're going to go with all of that
but I figured this would be more
appropriate for that particular project
so the front is this is Wow this is this
is really nice okay so the soft touch
finish is on these parts here so this
plastic trim piece here which has a bit
of flex to it okay you can actually
absorb a fair bit of shock but doesn't
look bowed actually even the even the
bottom right now it's got a little bit
of bow to it but not much it looks
pretty sleek and the soft touch finish
is also here on the front so on the
front piece here as well as the five and
a quarter inch bay cover the five and a
quarter if a cover I think is important
to have that same finish in that same
color because a lot of people for an ITX
system aren't even going to bother with
actually a lot of people in general
don't bother with optical drives anymore
anyway you've also got a pretty
nice-looking BitFenix logo here on the
front I really like their logo with the
shield in the wings I think it looks
pretty sleek a lot of the time you get a
company logo right in the middle of a
product it just looks like stupid like
remember the old remember the old Adele
Circle logo I've been put in on the side
of the panel like this big and you're
just looking at it going wool it's
horrible
why would you do that so so yeah I don't
mind when it's a nice cool-looking logo
like that on the side we find power
reset microphone headphone and two USB
3.0 ports on the back we find Wow look
at that 120 ml or 140 millimeter cooling
fan we've also got oh this oh I like
this system I've seen this before
so you loosen this okay it's a little
bit tight from the factory but off to
grab the screwdriver but you loosen this
piece lift it up and then it moves the
plate that holds down the the two
expansion cards so remember guys this is
ITX so you can only are actually going
to be installing one expansion card the
reason that they have two slots there is
because a lot of high-performance
graphics cards are dual slots so you
will need the additional slot for
cooling you can see that the motherboard
is mounted horizontally based on where
the i/o shield is going to go and it
accepts a standard ATX power supply once
again using thumb screws and I've seen
this before as well so you take this
plate off you mount the power supply to
it and then you slide the whole thing in
from the back in fact that's not even
just a characteristic of smaller cases
even mighty jo7 mounts the power supply
like that on the top here we've got a
switch which now allows us to remove
this there you go like that easily
cleanable filtered mesh and it just
snaps in place with yes now cool oh and
that's where we find the place where we
would potentially be mounting a dual
radiator so it looks like that probably
goes in from the inside you know it's
not they don't expect you to just kind
of like put it right here although you
know what that wouldn't have been a bad
approach either if if they left a little
bit more if they left to let you know
you could probably even mod this to go
like this if you painted a radiator like
you know like a nice white for example
and then put like you know pretty
slick-looking
white fangirls on it shave that down a
little bit and throw this on here that
could actually look really really good
and then you'd save yourself even a bit
more room inside you might even be able
to go like push pull if you wanted to be
pretty ridiculous about it so that's
kind of a cool interesting development
here alright so moving right along you
know what give me a second here guys
because it looks like I'm going to need
a screwdriver to open this
not completely yet stuck all right so
we've loosened all the screws and we are
now ready to go ahead and open up the
back of the case so here we go we can
take off things like the power supply
bracket like I said you just mount back
to your power supply you can clearly see
the power supply mounting has a nice
little rubber mounts there go ahead and
do that okay let's take off the side
panels let's take off the backside panel
first because that's the one I'm a
little bit more curious about how
exactly they've executed it because you
can see these buttons are all sort of
part of it oh okay that's going to be a
bit of a wiring trickiness although I
don't think it's that big of a deal
because what you should really be doing
is doing all of your wiring putting on
your backside panel then you'll wire
these up and then you put on your other
side panel I mean I can't think of any
really good reason why you need to take
off the side panel looking at the
interior of the case right now here so
okay fascinating sorry this sorry I'm
not letting you guys see what I'm
looking at another cool thing I'll check
this out guys
we've got SSD mounts on the inside of
this panel there's just a plastic piece
right here you can actually take it off
you can see there's four screws that
hold in this plastic piece and you can
put up to two SSDs in here I'm a huge
fan of mounting SSDs on like the back of
your motherboard tray or on your side
panel because I think in my mind that's
the whole point of SSDs being small so
that you don't actually have to have a
huge case and you can have all these
SSDs and stuff so that that that
definitely gets a big checkmark plus
from from me so yeah the whole thing is
very solid actually like you can see how
thick oh my don't my iPhone in my pocket
okay whatever so the odd yeah it's okay
no one cares about your HTC phone ah
sorry so cuz anyway thick metal thick
steel moving right along
let's flip it around to the other side
so we can get it all stripped down
before we try to analyze it too much so
here we've got more ventilation
I am fully expecting this case to be
very very vent
elation friendly so you can see that
right next to the graphics card they're
not just doing it willy-nilly right next
to the graphics card is where they put
additional ventilation holes so what
that will allow you to do is install a
Bravo I'm trying to find a video card
just sort of bear with me for a sec here
guys um you can install graphics cards
that use a blower design cooler um yeah
I found one that doesn't use a blower
design found the blower design cool if
it isn't mounted to a card okay this'll
have to do here we go
you can either mount a weird video card
that uses like a like an aftermarket e
style design that doesn't blow all the
air out of the case because you've got
pretty good ventilation with the vents
here as well as the on the top but what
I'd really recommend with a case like
this is a cooler that uses an external
blower design so it's pulling air in
from here and then it's exhausting it
right out the back of the case so you
can actually isolate the cooling of many
of the components of your system into
the zone so you've got your power supply
isolated into you know let's just try to
hold on to these for now you've got your
power supply isolated into a zone
because it's pulling air directly from
under the case through a filter so you
can see the filter is easily removable
here just clean that throw it back in
through a filter and then right out of
the case you got your video card pulling
air in through the perforations and then
blowing it right out of the back of the
case and then the only thing that's
going to rely on the general case
airflow is going to be your CPU and you
know your RAM and other trivial things
like that so so it makes for a very very
sound very efficient cooling system now
of note is the fact that unlike many
cases that use this bottom intake air
thing for the power supply BitFenix is
actually given enough space under the
case for it to get an adequate airflow
supply you see a lot of cases that just
have little feet you know about this big
and then if you put them on carpet that
power supply is going to be completely
starved for airflow unless you flip it
over and then you're pulling in warm air
from the video card or whatever else is
nearby and you're not cooling your power
as efficiently and since your power
supply is one of the fans that you have
the least control of in your system if
you feed hot air into it your system is
just automatically going to be louder so
they have thought of that and they have
given you ways of combating that you can
see the ITX motherboard trays right here
again very solid I'm really impressed
with the rigidity and how solid this
case is no no don't worry that wasn't it
not being solid this whole harddrive
sled comes right out so that's really
cool you can mount up to three three and
a half inch drives or three 2.5 inch
drives in the with the 2.5 inch mounting
holes right here that also gives you
additional room for graphics cards so
you know what I am going to go hold on
let's posit I'm going to go find another
graphics card so yeah we found out that
we can actually install a pretty darn
big graphics card in there if we remove
the hard drive cage so the 6990 is the
largest graphics card that I have on
hand and I think almost anyone has on
hand and that fits in there just fine
once you remove the other three and a
half inch base so that doesn't mean that
you can't install any drives anymore
because check this out guys it's very
efficiently laid out you can actually
put an additional two three and a half
inch drives or 2.5 inch drives right
over there they've also got more SSD
mounting holes right there on the bottom
so you can mount another SSD in the
bottom so you can do two SSDs on that
side panel an SSD bolted to the bottom
of the case
you can do then up to five three and a
half inch or additional to the half inch
drive so natively I could actually mount
my hair check this up
natively I could mount my ridiculous
eight SSDs that I use in my personal
system into the BitFenix prodigy however
I wouldn't have anywhere to put the raid
card unless I wanted to run onboard
video but you know whatever
the point is just it accepts a lot of
drives given the form factor you can
mount a five and a quarter inch drive
and they haven't limited you to a
slimline again the mounting is very
solid you saw this from the top already
I think so that's pretty pretty
self-explanatory and now I think the
next thing to get home Oh check this out
okay you know what we'll be back in a
minute so we figured out the front fan
situation you
can do dual 120 millimeter wave fans you
can do 140 on 180 of 200 or 230 if you
don't decide to do dual 120 so it comes
with all the various mounting holes you
need and you can fully remove the five
and a quarter inch cage if you don't
need it so if you wanted to put a front
radiator you need to get that under out
of your way all you got to do is undo a
couple screws here and then you pop off
the front panel which incidentally is
also how you mount fans um I can okay we
did this off-camera so she may be that
hard at least slick did it this long oh
okay yeah I was pressing against the
front while I was trying to clip it so
the front panel comes off like that you
can see all the ventilation holes that
are providing actual air flow to those
front fans so that they don't just
starve and you're flipping her around so
here's the sizing so if you were to put
a dual 120 mil radiator there it would
take out pretty much the whole front of
the case I mean most of that would be
our flow up here would be where the
barbs go and there wouldn't really be
any mesh there but that that is how that
would work now what slick and I are
going to have to figure out is if we do
my idea where we put the radiator
actually on the top of the case and and
like make the cuts that we need to could
we actually mount to dual radiators in
this case which would be actually you
know what we could probably do two duals
and a single in the back so we could do
up to five 120 millimeter radiators in
this case with a little bit of
creativity which would obviously be the
ultimate overclocked like hackintosh
editing pc so so we're I honestly think
this case just gets our DIY juices
flowing because there's a lot of
different stuff you can do with it so
you can remove this you can remove this
if you want to you just got to undo a
few screws on the bottom and you still
have the option to mount your three SSDs
so you can make yourself like SSDs are
getting so much less expensive you can
make yourself like a raid 5 of 3 256 gig
SSDs which is going to be 500 gigs of
storage space which is more than enough
for whatever you need to do sort of day
to day and you have a
for it you know ad Roble or something to
story for your mass storage and yeah
let's just say slick and I are really
excited about what kind of projects we
can get going on this case so thank you
for checking out my unboxing of the now
gutted and completely unrecognizable
BitFenix prodigy and I hope you guys are
as excited about this case as I am don't
