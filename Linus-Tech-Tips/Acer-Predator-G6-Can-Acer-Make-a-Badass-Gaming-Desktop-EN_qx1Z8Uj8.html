these guys have aged nearly three years
since we unboxed the predator gee a
normally sir desktop with an orange
accent and a basic video card in it in a
playground and while our sense of humor
certainly hasn't gotten any more
politically correct or sophisticated
it's possible given the improvement in
their monitor and laptop lineups that
acer has managed to grow up a little in
that time let's find out
this is the predator g6
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more
the first big improvement was
immediately apparent when I opened the
box I still remember back when I did a
competitive analysis purchase of an
alienware gaming machine back at NCIX
and the mouse it came with was so light
I wasn't even sure there was anything
inside it Acer on the other hand blew me
away here by including a SteelSeries
sensei raw gaming mouse and an apex Raw
gaming keyboard I thought maybe it was a
special reviewers package or something
like that but it's not if you buy this
model of predator g6 and a predator
monitor you're going to be ready to go
ad headset and you are gaming which
leads me perfectly I guess to the
physical tour of the machine itself the
overall appearance of the g6 is going to
be a leavener hated thing the side
panels have their I am OH attractive
predator logo with a really nice mesh
texture to them that's solid on the
right and mostly solid on the left but
actually perforated above the GPU and
CPU area a nice touch as far as the
front and the top are concerned I think
Acer was going for like an overlapping
armor plate thing but they ended up with
more yen IMO of an armadillo look though
your mileage may vary they've embedded
some practical elements amidst the
plates though from the bottom to the top
we've got a retractable headphone holder
front i/o with two USB 3.0 ports front
audio jacks and a USB 2 based SD card
reader above that we can press on the
right right here oh man and we got
ourselves a little quick drive upgrade
bay that will work coolest thing with a
three and a half inch drive or except a
tuna 1/2 inch drive with screws then
moving up further we've got on the $2000
trim model on blu-ray reader with a DVD
writer combo unit thing leaving only the
power button above that oh wait maybe
there's more this is what it looks like
it's the return of the turbo button but
this is
your mom's turbo button this one is
different
instead of just being a boring button
well it lights up and not just itself
but the entire machine the front and
side panels when you activate it the
other difference is that it toggles the
system between a stock all Core 4
gigahertz turbo speed and an overclocked
4.6 gigahertz turbo speed rather than
toggling between stock speed and a
dramatic underclock to improve
compatibility with older programs these
OneTouch overclocking tools can be a
little bit flaky in my experience though
especially if the manufacturer tries to
do any more than a token couple percent
overclock but in practice the predator
g6 was stable with the overclock so I've
resolved at this point to keep it on for
my testing so let's rip or open and talk
guts now shall we with the plastic cover
removed from the back and the side
panels off the g6 chassis bears a lot
more similarity to that last predator
machine I mean this is a very basic
steel chassis with a cool skin over it
folks it has a rear 92 millimeter fan 2
internal hard drive or SSD mounts one of
which has a 2 terabyte Seagate Drive in
it and so that's about it for expansion
and no cable management to speak of but
it does do a few things right it accepts
a standard and ATX motherboard and ATX
power supply which by the way is a 750
watt FSP 80-plus unit good show Acer and
has tons of room for any single graphics
card that you could want in the bottom
on the motherboard is a core i7 6700 K
quad core 16 gigs of dual-channel ddr2
ram the 4 slots allow this to be
expanded to 64 gigs in the future a
Wi-Fi module with antennas leading up to
the front of the chassis a 256 gig em
SATA SSD and 2 PCI Express 1x expansion
slots with a very basic rear i/o I'm
actually disappointed by the lack of
audio jacks here and then finally the
centerpiece of the build the GTX 980
graphics card that makes this machine
and Vidya VR ready certified so those
are some pretty badass
right and if you were paying attention
you probably noticed the same thing I
noticed there's only one case fan that
92 millimeter affair in the rear so
let's direct our attention now to
cooling performance here's a look at our
baseline idle CPU temps and here's a
look at whoa
with i-264 running a burnin test it took
only five minutes from my CPU to reach
very uncomfortable temperatures and this
is in our unheated warehouse and while I
understand that acer is expecting this
feature to be used for gaming which is
not going to pin the cpu at 100% the way
this artificial workload does many
gamers interested in a core i7 might
also be interested in heavy workloads
like video creation and they may not
want their cpu touching 80 to 90 degree
temperatures under load so I press the
button again to disable the overclock
which brought things right back into
comfortable territory and you can make
the argument that the management utility
that comes pre-loaded does include an
option to crank the fans to max which
works by the way to tame the beast the
problem is that it makes the machine
unpleasantly loud and I'm a little
disappointed then in a search validation
process for this feature and I hope that
they can find a better middle ground
between thermal throttling and sounding
like a hairdryer with some kind of a
software update with all that griping
about thermals aside though it's not
like they screwed up anything royally in
terms of performance I mean when I'm not
using an artificial workload to make it
throttle it performs exactly like you'd
expect from a machine of this
specification and they did a good job I
think of putting together a package that
makes sense an SSD boot drive and a hard
drive for mass storage is a great
solution but since my job is to give
constructive criticism while the
pre-installed software was almost
entirely unoffensive with some notable
good inclusions like a surprisingly
useful system toolbox steam and Firefox
I feel like for everyday joe users the
to drive solution could be a bit more
seamless I mean here's an idea how about
having Windows storage folders and Steam
library on the hard drive out of the
factory I mean the number of times
but I have gotten service calls from
people who are out of hard drive space
but have an empty drive or worse a
partition is staggering which leads us
to the conclusion the g6 strikes me as a
reflection of overall improvements to
the pre-built PC industry that were
mostly borrowed from DIY case makers and
enthusiasts better upgradability solid
power supply included rubber grommets on
the hard drive mounts legitimately
high-end video card options etc as
opposed to some sort of forward-thinking
product I mean Lenovo king of exciting
computers right has a similar spec
machine for a little bit cheaper which
gives you a few bucks then to pick up
some equivalent peripherals making it
pretty darn similar and I mean if you're
willing to go to a boutique builder like
an I buy power rather than a tier one
then there are definitely better values
out there and I'm ignoring the DIY
market here as well intentionally since
they aren't really the target for a
product like this so does that mean that
the g6 is bad no it's not it just looked
really cool from the outside and then
failed to really excite me once I lifted
up the hood so now with that out of the
way we can take a moment to talk about
curiosity stream the world's first
ad-free nonfiction streaming service
founded by John Hendricks the founder of
Discovery Communications I checked it
out recently and it's got actually tons
of videos they've got over 1200 videos
with a wide variety of Science and
Technology content so they've got
exclusive interviews and lectures
they've got documentaries they've got
just kind of they've got some
kid-friendly stuff as well they support
a variety of platforms including a web
app roku android which is where i've
been using it on my phone iOS chromecast
amazon fire and thus on kindle apple TV
is on the way but of course that is
subject to a change some of their
content includes next world which
features miss you Kaku talking about the
future of technology so virtual reality
artificial intelligence you know the
kinds of big questions as well as the
human face of big data which is
currently exclusively streaming on
curiosity stream and just premiered in
late February I checked out a really
cool one on this like submersible craft
that was found rusting away in a
shipyard actually here in Vancouver
which I thought was really neat that was
the first manned 30 day voyage where
these guys were like sealed into this
capsule for a full 30 days and actually
led to and I didn't realize this either
a lot of the best practices that are
followed for things like space missions
even today so really cool stuff and
anyone can sign up for a free 30-day
trial all you got to do is use promo
code Linus then to save 15% on your
first three months after that so check
out the link in the video description
