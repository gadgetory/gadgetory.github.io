options
maybe $69 is just a great position for
both the case manufacturer who doesn't
have to worry about choking their
profits and the customer who gets
everything they need at the same time
maybe it's just a good place to be when
you want a satisfying experience for
everyone so come with me let's see what
this case at this price point has to
offer and what I'm going to offer to it
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try total
bear for free check out the link in the
video description starting with the
front of the Red Line oh five there are
two plastic cutout tabs that function as
buttons for both power and reset on the
left hand side these tabs have a decent
if rather stiff tactile feel on the
right hand side we have dual USB 3 ports
and both headphone and microphone jacks
then we come to the PS tent of
resistance the killer feature at this
price point the USB type-c connector at
the top of the case Wow such beauty you
can stick your cable in either way I
can't wait before we move on
note that the case does come with red
accents like the name would imply but I
went with black on black because that's
more my thing and there are a couple
more things to note here at the front
once you remove the front bezel you can
see the USB cables for both the type-c
connector and the type-a front
connectors are permanently attached to
the front but having one of them at the
top and one of them at the side makes it
so that once you've managed all of your
cables the front panel gets a little
hard to remove which wouldn't matter
except that unless you take it off you
can't access the included and poorly
mounted fan filter I get it it's better
for the USB signal for them not to be
removable but I still think there's room
for improvement here okay I'm sorry I
swear this doesn't normally happen but I
seem to have started a little bit
prematurely and forgotten the case the
left panel has a large window cutout to
reveal all of your glorious components
for the world to see and the right side
panel is just plain old metal moving on
to the bottom of the case you have
another fan filter this one easier to
access under the power supply just
behind the stamped on spray stencil made
in China logo good thing that's on the
bottom which brings us to the top of the
case do you see the problems here there
are actually two main ones one of them
is the positioning of the ventilation
aesthetically it's pleasing because it
goes right down the middle of the top
but functionally it's a little
frustrating because it goes right over
the top
your motherboard this makes the
installation of 140 millimeter fans more
difficult than it needs to be and it
also makes the installation of a
radiator essentially impossible let's go
back to the 140 millimeter fan thing for
a moment though say you wanted to water
cool
you bought a dual 120 or 140 millimeter
fan AIO liquid cooler and put it in the
front of the case instead of the top not
a big deal well I don't personally
prefer this approach there are plenty of
cases out there where this is the most
optimal position what now frustrates me
is the spare 140 milsim burst own fans
that are left over where you put them
they don't fit in the back of the case
so the top I mean kinda the fan filter
up top is mounted through the 140
millimeter mounting holes already you
can make this work rather well by just
mounting each fan with three screws
instead of four but that makes cleaning
the filter a little annoying this also
could have been done better let's move
on to what I think is the strongest
aspect of the RL of five the interior
the main compartment of the case rocks a
great-looking basement cover to SSD
mounting points on top of the basement
cover although only one of them has a
convenient cable cutout rendering the
leftmost one a little bit more difficult
to wire up cleanly looking upwards from
here I really like what they did with
the cable management on the right side
of the motherboard this cable cover
looks better in my opinion than the
bunch of floppy rubber grommet cutout
holes that have been present in every
case since the 800 D that being said I
wouldn't have minded the affer mentioned
floppy rubber grommets for the cable
management hole up top or the header and
SSD connections down at the bottom
moving to the back of the motherboard
tray there is a well sized and correctly
placed CPU mounting cutout two more
spots for mounting SSDs although it must
be noted that for the four possible SSD
positions there are only two included
trays which to be fair is just as much
or more than most people who will buy a
$69.00 case will probably need then
below that there are two hard drive bays
and the power supply that sits up on
some foam feet to get elevated from the
floor and this is important I know Linus
has personal
he suffocated a power supply with the
fan facing downward on a carpeted floor
tragic which leads us to the bottom line
the RL of five is a very solid case with
tons of features to boot at a rather
aggressive price point but one that
doesn't enjoy the luxury of existing in
a vacuum one fierce competitor also at
$69 is the fantex
Eclipse P 400 it comes with a magnetic
external fan filter at the top rail
mounted fan filters elsewhere a proper
easy to remove front panel and an RGB
light controller to name a few features
a USB type-c connector is pretty sweet
though so which $69 building experience
do you think will be a more pleasurable
