an hour ago yeah a little bit more than
that actually 35 minutes ago
okay go to tweet do you want to say D um
yeah
tweets I would have done the Wilhelm
scream if I could do it facebook says no
that's not it no it's hard to do yeah it
is hard to do ah not you know what
forget it
so it's so crazy dramatic I know it's
fantastic oh boy do you even want to
hear the excuse today are we just like
done it happens every time you just done
with my excuses was it that um the no no
now that actually wasn't really anything
to do with it okay sure that I want to
know the excuse okay so the excuse this
time
was that wait what was I doing
hold on oh no no it was superb you know
one of the side effects of like you know
that recent video we uploaded the Dolby
one yeah there's a lot of comments like
bringing it back and stuff one of the
side effects of not showing up is
everyone seems to love me I know what
chad is like all over me right now and
the comments on that video like a huge
one of the top ones are about me thank
you I appreciate it
maybe I should just never come back you
know what and people just love me
forever until they completely forget
about me yeah I was gonna say that's the
part that's the part that comes out yeah
maybe I'll go away for a month
oh god what do you think that would be
like bad if Linus tech tips just had
know Linus for a month James loves being
on camera yeah I think you know we could
just have we could have Brandon do like
you know a motherboard review he might
not have the same strict lover right
yeah I like Brandon's I like Brandon
style I like John style yep I don't
think John likes hosting though I talked
to him about it today actually we we had
we had a chat about going over to it and
I well I don't know I'm not gonna speak
for him in any way because if he wants
to speak for himself but Nene
to get in front of the camera and speak
for himself oh so that's totally up to
him okay but I will say my side my side
was that I encouraged him
aye aye I like his style personally I
think he's a good host I would rather
watch tech quickie with John hosting
than watch with me hosting so I I like
it I think he's awesome twitch chats
freaking out if someone in chat they
only love you when you're gone sounds
like a bad country song it sort of does
you know what love me when I'm gone
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
twang I want a guitar that like isn't
actually a guitar it's just like touch
sensitive strings yeah throw the inside
yeah and it just goes like twang twang
twang twang twang twang twang be a great
day bad auto-tune things where it's just
like a flat voice recording you saying
playing and then it's just it's just
adjusted up right well that's great like
the cows and um dialo - is that aging
myself now yeah cow level yeah yeah a
little bit let's remind you I mean okay
hold on
yes that is a cow is what the sorcerer
says in Diablo 1 if you click on the cow
enough times yeah so if you were dating
yourself then I married myself all for
that set I also played the hell at a
devil one we used to play two player on
one character yeah okay so like I would
control like movement and attack or my
body would do that and then the other
person was on like consumables yeah yeah
it's freaking awesome dude oh man no -
Devon
set up to Devin yeah set out to
meow-meow I'm a cow all right so we got
a lot of great topics for you guys today
actually we've got like nothing nothing
happened this week
there's the scandal with oneplus
collecting user data ooh um there's
whether or not Apple throttles old
iPhones ooh there's what's coming out on
floatplane heck yeah there's actually
really cool things like scrapyard
there's two episodes live on floatplane
right now and there will be a third this
weekend yeah yeah yeah Airbnb is
apparently constructing an apartment
building because that's what we're gonna
talk about hold on hold on hold on a lot
of other news yeah I'm posting the link
to where to join floatplanes so that
people can go watch oh wow I was trying
to post the link and then all the
authentication came and hit me like a
ton of bricks because that's the world
we live in
yep you have to have all of those things
you have to have all the passwords and
all the authentications and all that oh
I entered it wrong and all the this
could take and I got it you know how
tempted I was it's cool yeah I just
entered it wrong again I I swear
last night no I swear the LastPass text
entry field I swear it doesn't take
characters in order sometimes cuz it's
like you know that's kind of laggy in
general like it takes a long time to
open it and sometimes they take a while
to okay like I swear there's times when
I enter it right and it just doesn't
take it
tell me something okay you're more of a
security guy than me okay tell me
something yeah
would it be a reasonable and/or
effective security measure for them to
occasionally reject the correct password
and just make you type it again I don't
really think so well okay look so let's
say someone was using a dictionary
attack with a dictionary attack ever try
the same thing twice but then it only
does it occasionally well no okay let's
say if it let's say every time it was
from a new IP or a new device it would
actually just like
not work because but then people doing
that dictionary attack would know that
why if it just said it if it just said
invalid password I'm pretty sure people
would figure it out
you think so that it's like Auto
rejecting correct passwords I'm pretty
sure that would be like posted somewhere
pretty quickly okay I feel like that's
that's figure out a bowl okay I was just
curious
I'm just getting discoverable tactic I
don't I don't think it would be super
effective so it would be like like
having three layers so it would be kind
of like hold on water on plant it's like
it's like kind of effective water on
plant yeah I did very much I thought
that was like weaker wasn't it yeah yeah
but like it works though it's not it's
not like oh it's not electric against
rock yeah yeah yeah yeah I don't
remember what that's actually I don't
remember what the exact phrase that they
say is there's a twitch beta that was me
not you there's a twitch beta do I
continue to beta oh man I feel like my
whole life is about continuing to beta
Wow will I ever be an alpha ever I think
you have alpha traits alpha traits
yeah well that's appreciate it you're a
leader you run a company yeah but I run
like like I'd like a tech you two you
still run a company
okay that's yesterday you took the risk
to start the company mmm-hmm
I don't think there's someone ran at you
with a bat you're suddenly not alpha
anymore yeah I think but outside of that
outside of physical confrontation I
think you're quite if we're okay if
we're if we're going all the way back to
like you know the primal you know alpha
beta designations then like what there
are alpha traits that are social doesn't
the stick like pretty much summarized it
isn't that the whole point but there are
alpha traits that are sort of like you
do quite well in that regard I
appreciate that very nice no problem oh
man what else do we have for topics
today
intro yeah Wow it's weird it's just a
rumor
that's an interesting discussion though
yeah if nothing else apparently I'm a
master beta which sounds amazing I want
to be a master beta all day yep we got
so even if no one in the audience liked
it then where'd they where'd that coming
god moves too fast there's all our
sponsors and stuff alright so let's get
this poop show on the road so this was
originally posted by just to be on the
forum then the original article here is
from Chris DC more co uk Wow
and in a nutshell posting this in the
chat by the way okay there is a way to
remove the oneplus device manager app
via ADB without requiring root but up
until that happened there was an ongoing
scandal this week that was started from
Chris's security and tech blog finding
out that oneplus is actually collecting
a lot of user data tied to the phone
serial number so collecting user data
anonymously means that you are
collecting the user data without any
additional information that could allow
it to be tied directly to the user so an
example might be if Luke and I both
opted in to an anonymous data collection
schema through our device or our
computer or what did I do for some
things which I do for some retailers
let's say that we did or GeForce
experience I don't for that and I don't
either um I don't have g4 I used to like
GeForce experience it was nice the idea
is that if Luke had Chrome on his phone
yeah and I had Chrome on my phone this
company would take that information that
two users have chrome installed and then
maybe they would look at a bunch of
other users and figure out that 70% of
their users are installing Google Chrome
that is anonymous data it's still useful
and it's still valuable there's even
some stuff where it might be like two
users from British Columbia Canada yes
but it's not enough to tag down to you
it's not like two users from these home
addresses yes
it's two users from this Geo exactly so
once they tie it to a serial number
feasibly they could tie it especially
since one plus sells through their own
store they could tie it to a name and
address a credit card everything yeah if
there's ever a criminal investigation
where they seize property they could get
the phone get the serial number and then
get all the data that way so this
happens when the phone screen is locked
or unlocked the phone's IMEI phone
numbers MAC addresses mobile network
names and IM SI prefixes as well as wow
wireless network SSID is timestamp
ranges of when and which applications on
the phone are opened and closed
timestamps of which activities were
fired up in which applications and so
the code responsible for this data
collection is part of the oneplus Device
Manager that's enough for me to
literally never have a oneplus device
ever so again like if verified true all
that yeah it looks this is a thing yeah
that seems to be going against it all of
this is fine if it's anonymized so it
cannot contain the IMEI okay it can't
contain the phone number when I say all
of this is okay if it's a randomized I
mean I mean all of the things look
actually no most of this is just not
okay yeah okay hold on hold on hold on
um when applications on the phone are
open and closed and what people do in
them if you agree to a program that
collects that data people do it them if
it's not if it's anonymized if it's
truly anonymized then okay but if it
isn't
if it is submitting any of this other
information that ties it to a person
then this is like can they still have to
ask yes and you still have to ask and
they didn't ask so none of it's okay so
like if they're like hey in this app
when you're signing up here's a checkbox
specifically the outside of the Terms of
Service asks its own specific question
which is can we harvest anonymous user
data and you're like yes and then
they're like hmm okay
this user seems to click on this area of
the screen a lot let's compare that
against all the other users okay all of
the users seem to click on this area of
the screen a lot let's put more
important things up here because they
seem to be focused up there that's like
a common use case for things that's fine
taking my wireless network IDs and when
I open apps so you can sell me crap and
track my movement is not fine Wow we'll
never personally use a oneplus device
huh how about that let's screw that
noise that's wonderful
so okay the good news if you already
have a 1 plus device is that you can
remove it so here we go bla bla bla bla
bla so the Twitter user yeah this is
sick can ski Jacobs secants it come back
to the screen share this guy there we go
I'm assuming you did a pretty ok job so
there you go this is the command to
disable oneplus as analytics permanently
so there you go go check that out it's
over on Chris DC Mourdock oh that's
something that the average user can do I
very appreciate that Jacob did this it's
been nothing but it's my same response
to what was it on that weird watch thing
that I did dad neo armband thing no no
that was cool
no the one that I hated the kick verted
won all the Neptune pine first of all
Neptune pine was one of the spy devices
in the most recent fast and furious was
it really yeah I was watching it with
MAPE and then MAPE and I at the same
time or like what cuz he hasn't he's
like doing crazy spy stuff on it are
they just using it as like a problem yes
surely they didn't I'm pretty sure it's
like green screen or something like it's
it's not there's no if there's no
branding
anywhere but it's a Neptune pot your
yeah I'm 100% sure
Neptune pie in Fast and Furious yeah I I
doubt anyone else even noticed like boom
is that it right there hold on that's it
on his wrist
there's better yeah there's better
moments of it but it's definitely that
let me see if I can find it ha I mean I
guess yeah that like like going and
getting some stupid obscure device is
probably better than Korean it has like
a big scratch on it and stuff yeah I got
a bunch of tweets right after the movie
came out huh yeah I can't find a good
picture of it but wow that's crazy
what was I talking about I don't
remember okay anyways
Wow I super don't remember me neither
okay I'm totally engrossed in this being
on I'm baffled about I'm tired why was
this week so tiring we had a day off
I'm bath about Neptune Pine SmartWatch
playing an integral part of Fast &amp;amp;
Furious 8 I have to confess I have never
seen a fast and furious movie not one no
or two or three I didn't mean I so I I
like them but in the sense of like yeah
that was entertaining ly stupid but not
in the quality entertainingly stupid way
that like Kingsman is okay in the gist
more stupid how did Kingsman have a 50
per Kingsman to have a 50% rating on
rotten tomato kay we went on a date last
week yeah we went out on Friday night we
went to see Kingsman the Golden Circle
and then had no it was both of us were
laughing out like I very rare
it was so good and you should you don't
have to to enjoy it but you should
absolutely watch the first one first yes
yeah you don't have to at all totally
don't have to but it would be kind of a
drag to watch the first one after
knowing the plot of the second one yeah
so yeah we worry no spoilers or anything
but like it was awesome if you have a
sense of humor then go see it it's so
good prepare to turn your brain off for
a couple hours because it's fine but
it's like I'd I my my family was asking
me what it was and I was like it's James
Bond crossed with 60s Batman kind of not
like perfectly but that's probably
because I have a really hard time
explaining it as well yeah that's a
pretty good way to do it yeah it misses
some of the like raunchy side of things
yeah yeah but yeah yeah but it's just
it's it's it's you're fun but like with
better production values and slicker
yeah yeah and the acting honestly for
what they are trying
yeah he's really good they found guys
that can keep straight faces pretty well
and stuff by the way I remember the
thing I was trying to talk about when I
did my Neptune pine review if you guys
remember that I brought up something
called Neptune ninja which was this
website that was all based around like
how to kind of break it so that it would
work better and it was super cool and I
commended the guys that made that site
because it was honestly quite awesome
and it made the Neptune pine a lot
better but it shouldn't need to exist
right and that's something that I said
in the review too like I'm happy that
these dudes came together and made this
device so much better so the people that
bought it would actually have like an
experience that was still not good but
better than what they were given
slightly less horrible yeah so like
that's cool I saw all the Neptune ninja
guys like great good work but really you
shouldn't have
had to do that so like that bit of code
to remove the thing that's great I'm
very happy the guy posted there that's
really great you're helping a lot of
people that's very good I don't think
that you should have had to do that yeah
so wasn't digging on him all right so
this is fun a story but man this says
last week a story went viral that
claimed Apple was intentionally slowing
down older iPhones to push people to buy
its latest models I mean you could
replace last week with any week in
history any period in time yeah any
period in the last eight years yeah um
and this claim this particular claim was
based on data which shows that Google
searches for iPhone slow spike
dramatically with the release of each
new model
fortunately future mark has heaps of
data from seven different iPhone models
across three different versions of iOS
and as for the results well let's go
ahead and bring it up this was
originally posted by Hayao on the forum
and here we go here's the Apple iPhone
5s CPU performance from a
2016 2 September 2017 that is a flat ass
line there's some dips there's some
raises but it's the GPU performance that
gets better mm-hmm about as better as
you'd expect from GPU driver revisions
here's the iPhone 6 so CPU performance
did go down a bit but GPU performance
went up like a fair chunk and I'm pretty
good amount the 6s okay so it comes and
goes it's doing okay now a little worse
for the wear than when it was released
with the 6s being a little bit slower on
CPU now as well and as for the seven
well it's holding about as steady as any
of the other ones so if the theory is
that okay so here we go our benchmarking
data shows that rather than
intentionally degrading the performance
of older models Apple actually does a
good job of supporting its older devices
with regular updates that maintain a
consistent level of performance across
iOS versions says future mark because
remember guys even though we do see that
CPU performance go down a little bit you
have to remember that new versions of
iOS do new stuff and have new services
running the fact that you still have
enough left over cycles in order to get
a very similar score on the benchmark is
actually pretty good now with that said
it's not like I don't think that in
particular UI responsiveness couldn't
stay more better than it does but there
are other factors at play here too and
it's hard to benchmark UI responsiveness
it's very difficult to benchmark that
and there are other factors at play here
too like for example this is something a
lot of people don't necessarily even if
they know it they don't necessarily
think about it in the context of their
phone but NAND flash the storage that's
used for every phone I can't think of a
five I tried to think if there's a phone
with a hard drive in it like they had a
hard drive based ipods hold on a second
did anyone do a phone with a like 1.8
inch hard drive anyway I can't think of
one but but people don't necessarily
realize that even though SSDs have no
moving parts their performance does
degrade over time
especially if they spend a lot of their
life at or near their full capacity so
you may actually notice things like app
loading times degrade and this could be
due to retired blocks in your NAND flash
and the controller having to work around
that it could be due to your phone being
quite full it could be due to just
typical OS bloat which happens with
every device pretty much across the
board it's something I don't actually
quite understand that well like why is
it that a few text entries in the
Windows registry means that my computer
is slow slower now this doesn't quite
compute for me it's a little bit more
complicated I'm sure it is but I mean
this okay this is another me being an
ignorant moron but maybe you can explain
this one to me too why is it that when I
take a super old game so 1602 ad is the
example that I have okay so I know where
you're going with this Isis where like a
lot of times it's it's timed out yeah or
like a certain application is not
necessarily timed out but can only
access a certain amount of resources so
because that application can only use so
much it doesn't matter that you have
much more hardware okay because where I
was going with this was that that
particular game if you have it on an ISO
it's a CD okay so it's like 605 Meg's or
whatever a CD is if you have it on an
ISO on an nvme SSD and you install that
game on a modern processor I think the
minimum requirements for it are like 90
megahertz p1 or something like that
maybe 200 megahertz Pentium 1 it still
takes like 10-15 minutes to install and
I'm kind of sitting here going we could
have unpacked at the highest compression
level six hundred Meg's of data over and
over and over again in this time we
could have rewritten our entire registry
in this time and we could have
transferred six hundred Meg's back and
forth literally hundreds of times in
this time what are you working on I
don't I don't know like every I'm sure
these people in the twitch chat I'm sure
there's people in the archive that'll
know better than me so please post in
the comments
free but as far as I know its its timing
stuff some things are set up to go after
a certain amount of time some things are
set up to take a certain amount of time
some things are only able to use so much
performance I pretty much guarantee you
all of that is single threaded its
middle-out compression no no that was
hold on who said this that seems very
credible chicken-fried but says that
credible name chicken-fried but credible
name middle of compression you know what
I don't know why I didn't think of that
it's so obvious now if someone corrected
me a no 16:02 yes that is what it was
called another territory as it was
called speaking of someone correcting me
I screwed up pretty bad earlier in the
show Oh what did you do I said electric
doesn't work against rock it's electric
doesn't work against ground so it would
work on a Geodude but not on a Diglett
yeah you suck so much wow that's
embarrassing for you it's sort of is Wow
I don't think I got any of it wrong even
no I don't think so
wow I haven't touched Pokemon in like 10
years you know that right yeah I see
you're like yeah I'm like Loki rubbing
it in right now yeah that hurts wow that
sucks man yeah that's pretty bad
Wow cuz you're like you're like a
Pokemon guy to be fair I do he's
electric very much Wow but I still I use
well apparently Geodude is ground rock I
was well yeah and I run gravel errs and
Geodude a lot so I knew that bit but
like the day the alcoholism started I'm
just gonna go home and get smashed and
play shadow for
a private loot crate's about forgetting
Pokemon stuff
oh I had to add too much fun with that
speaking of having too much fun want to
create a website it's super fun but all
the fun you're having yeah that all the
fun you're having oh wow
okay two week free trial how many of you
guys can go to squarespace.com slash win
get a trial and create your own
beautiful responsive design website
about how Luke was wrong I was just
about mine the easy direction was gonna
be about all the fun you're having but I
was like no this he can be about
roasting me about Pokemon and you gotta
send it to him on Twitter because
Squarespace is so easy-to-use that
anybody can make a great website and
they have free tech support via live
chat and email then if you decide you
love your Squarespace site so much if
you and twelve friends got together it
would cost each of you only $1 a month
forever every website comes with
commerce so you could sell commemorative
Luke was wrong Wow memorabilia every
site comes with their logo debunked and
many tools many tools that make it
easier to make your own beautiful site
and you can start a trial with no credit
card required by the squarespace.com
slash wound and use offer code when to
save 10% or should it be offer code oh
my goodness oh that was too much fun I
think for that you have to eat the spicy
jerky I am going to eat the spicy jerky
but first I'm gonna put on this shirt
from Mac well then this shirt is also
from Mac well that's already on because
I have to do this
why didn't tell you oh they sent new
stuff yeah oh it's a long sleeve I love
these cool so Mac Weldon the online
store that believes in smart design
premium fabrics and simple shopping it's
like super easy because you don't even
have to wear
underwear to buy underwear yes my
friends Mac Walden clothing is super
comfortable and did we nip slip look how
professional this show looks when we
have a caller Wow like seriously how
much does that step up the wine shows
game quite a bit but you got to get
these right because you're flaring so
you go roll up and they'll repin right
yeah see I don't know these things man
okay I'll work on that in the meantime
but like how Pro does that look Wow how
what direction is my life con I knew
that but not the Pokemon thing Wow Oh
first versions of me would be so
disappointed right now it's time to take
a step back and reevaluate Lee oh don't
see it with this one you just you just
go like this I can't pin it cuz your
forums are way too jacked okay that
makes sense
keep doing your thing then but you just
go like that but then you have like rank
monster forum so it doesn't well it's
not even monster it's just relative to
my wrists so I have like these skinny
wrists and then like that's there okay
oh there that's flexed
it's like badminton badminton um no I'll
just uh I'll give up on that no amount
of putting good clothing on me is gonna
make me knowledgeable but what I do know
about is their silver line of underwear
that is awesome because it has silver in
it which is naturally antimicrobial and
that's where the smell from your
clothing comes from I'm not saying you
never have to wash it
Mac Weldon isn't saying you never have
to wash it but definitely no one is
saying that but but the silver and the
clothing will help to fight odors so
head over to Mac weld and calm and get
20% off using offer code tectus Oh
apparently we've got a link here it's
Jeanie dot slash DV big G big y big you
know what why don't I just link this in
the chat also be under the video for the
archive
don't worry I'm logged in now so I got
this okay our last sponsor of the day
and I deserve this I deserve to suffer
and once okay do you want some jerky
James James is vegetarian oh sorry yes
it is oh they're too much no I saw a
second one no I saw a second there's
only one also you're not allowed to have
that yeah I can because you were mean
I'm just gonna have some first oh that
would be real punishment so if you had
to have that after you already burnt
your taste buds the folks over at savage
jerky we're on a mission to create a
snack that was full of flavor
but not bad for you they've got 13
different flavors of jerky the maple
buffalo bacon is awesome I love the
garlic lime and cilantro Moho this is
like my mouth is watering right now I'm
like super amped to eat that he's taking
the Moho I hate it there's no more than
two did you notice that you can have one
just take it just take it
no it's okay no take it no let's try to
find this one oh yeah the traditionals
really good I love the traditional so
anyway which flavors do okay I think
we've discussed the flavors we like
enough yeah so I I'm gonna eat this much
reaper okay okay okay but I want some
oh-ho first okay yeah yeah
Momo have an arrow in my opinion if
you're into spice is a good place to
start because it's quite spicy but it's
it's not like out of pain inducing level
we agree with that
which one's one of the spicy ones that I
really like because the whole one's kind
of a sissy one no Momo habanero all the
bit maple buffalo bacon always got more
of that all there's three bags of that
oh I'm like super amped right now the
what's it what's a good like a little
bit spicy one no I think we ended up
eating all of those really early on so
we don't have ya the Moho habanero is a
good one right yeah sure but you have to
it's like it's a little spicier than
most people can take I would I would
assume if you're like okay I would say
if you're iffy about spice that one
might be a little bit too hot but if you
like spice that's probably where I'd
suggest you start Oh God so this is this
is your just NoHo one right yeah so you
can use all four code LTT to save 10% on
all their products including their
barbecue sauce their hot sauce their
spice rub they have a Carolina Reaper
hot sauce that uses Carolina Reapers
which is one of the hottest peppers in
the world and that's for all orders this
week savage jerky will include a koozie
or a sticker with every order placed
using our code so that's code LTP
alright don't worry I'm gonna eat it
hate you full plate
oh yeah sure why not I'm the thing setup
I don't you know what that's why not so
do you want to do the next topic sure
what is the next topic there's like
nothing queer derby and being an
apartment building which like actually
kind of makes sense right isn't that
just a hotel anyways we'll figure this
out the first project a three hundred
and twenty four unit building in
Kissimmee Wow hopefully I'm saying that
right that's an interesting name for a
place kissing me for it I will be
branded as neato powered by Airbnb okay
the project is considered trendiest like
yeah hipster nonsense ever the project
is considered the first in a series of
development across the southeastern
United States Airbnb and neato will work
together to design new units and
buildings that include features like
keyless entry and shared common spaces
that make them optimal for home sharing
so it's a dorm
okay keyless entry though is a really
interesting concept because if you had
that setup for your house I bet you the
Airbnb app would let you in mm-hmm right
so all you would have to do is like the
person that maintains this unit which
might even just be Airbnb so it's
probably just a hotel is there's
probably no scent the central desk right
you just go in and you just go like use
it they'd have to clean up tokus yeah
there'd be there'd be cleaning staff but
probably other than that I doubt it nito
will fully support the costs of
construction and retain full ownership
of the buildings so it's a hotel
nito tenants will sign annual leases
okay okay I get it and we will be
permitted to HomeShare individual rooms
or their entire units through Airbnb for
for up to a hundred and eighty nights
per year okay so you have to live in it
but you're allowed to share it for half
of the year but you don't own it and you
why do I would anyone do this I don't
know like I choose to share their homes
will be part of Airbnb --zz friendly
buildings program in which hosts and
landlords share revenues generated from
home sharing so you can sublet so that
they don't have to take on all the risk
and they will share some of the revenue
with you yeah and you're gonna have to
buy like two units beside each other so
you can live in one half the year and
the other half the year okay I don't
think people necessarily intend to do
that
but you you can't rent it for half the
year so what else are you gonna do maybe
you like honestly that's the I know it
sounds super stupid but that's the most
logical way I can think of it maybe
we're totally missing something here
which chad is like i guess if it's in a
vacation spot wait is this just a
timeshare no they don't get it either
okay so we're not the only ones yeah
it's a timeshare Disney Kissimmee is
right by it yeah sure so you'll be able
to rent it a lot but you can only rent
it for 180 days okay so it's apparently
a requirement because of the law about
what qualifies as a hotel versus an
apartment
it's a city law like okay sure people
are talking about snowbirds so people
who want to be down there for happen up
here yeah but I mean I mean yeah I mean
that does make sense actually it is in
Florida oh geez sometime it is in
Florida so like Canadians or people that
live in the northern part of the USA I
could see that Minnesota it's been a
while since you had a really spicy what
because your tolerance was getting
really good I was handling it a little a
little better for a bit there anyways I
snowbirds make sense I think buying two
units and living in half half is super
weird but it makes sense the fact that
it's right near Disney means that you'll
probably be able to have it rented for
like most days so yeah I don't know
well my interesting idea I swear that's
hotter than usual oh no that's the Apple
enable panic attack to manage guest
stays remotely by triggering services
powered by a master host at each
property who will assist with items like
guests check in cleaning and linen
service so you
oh so you can yeah snowbirds that makes
tons of sense then the building yeah has
staff for cleaning and stuff yeah yeah
yes check in so you can be up in
Minnesota or whatever you said and then
just use this app to like manage your
little property way yeah okay and I
would expect that people wouldn't live
there for 180 days because I don't think
they would rent out every single day of
180 days that they're not there but they
probably live there for a lot of it like
a hundred days or something I'm not sure
okay from TechCrunch
iOS and Samsung are now tied for market
share in the US here's the article and
basically in the National Android is
still quite far okay can you do this I
feel free okay do you have any like
cream-based stuff no colonel
okay water isn't gonna help you all
right all right so yeah
iOS and Samsung markets are now tied in
the US based on new data from cantar
word panel you didn't put this up on
screen bull give me a sec there we go
Android is still far ahead in the US
however with 63.2% share to iOS is 35%
iPhones account for nearly 50% of
Verizon specific phones but I'm sure the
cheaper carriers probably have a lot
more Android phones because there is a
lot more cheaper Android phones in
general
Samsung dominates a Great Britain with
38.4% in urban China iOS has grown from
thirteen point four percent market share
last year to 17.7% thanks to iPhone 7
and iPhone 7 plus sales the top two best
sellers in urban China I wonder if the
iPhone eats gold color is gonna make a
dent in China because you know they got
weird they got rid of rose gold and they
have like a more actual gold color now
okay interesting probably actually what
else do we have
they should make the buttons on it red
yeah I know right
that would do well Samsung did that Iron
Man
yes yeah all right check this out so
good bytes from the forum made an
excellent post on the absolute Microsoft
yes hey on the upcoming Windows 10 ball
creators update that's coming on October
7th so in just a few days there is some
cool stuff in here
basically right at the top he already
had my attention because this is awesome
task manager now gets GPU usage and GPU
memory usage Oh
so you can actually see like we had to
fire up a third party utility like
afterburner that's pretty cool to see
how Adobe Premiere or Adobe Media
encoder was using CPU vs. GPU versus RAM
now it is all in one convenient place
that's for the temperature a stick and
get this it doesn't look like it no but
hold on hold on
it actually can break out what mask
what's using the DPO oh my god that's
pretty clean hell yeah hell yeah hell
yeah hell yeah that's frickin awesome
but would it get you to go to Windows 10
no okay then
all right what else we got improvements
to game mode battle over we'll get some
improvements bash on Windows yep
the volume mixer you can control the
volume of you WP apps individually I
hate if you run any you WP EPS the Plex
you WP app has this like stuff have you
moved on to the whenever you're playing
back at original quality and since a lot
of the time I'm playing rips the
blu-rays because no totally not no
totally not but like I'm like that's why
I own a blu-ray drive yeah literally the
only reason yeah ah what else would you
put a blu-ray in yeah like a player you
can like watch previews for a movie
anyway sorry um it's like so trash
compared to just like the regular player
folder protection so that's a regular
player now yes yeah and it's been nine
fixes in it yeah folder protection so
this is basically a ransomware defense
mechanism that will allow you to select
a folder as controlled folder access so
that it can't just be you know altered
by some some program that's installed on
your computer and you know more power
management so there's a slider for it
now some gooey stuff we're getting into
kind of kind of the boring stuff I
wasn't sharing the post anymore
oops Start menu I wonder if the Start
menu
Bonz when you click on it now cuz like
honestly that is that's what broke me my
single biggest complaint about Windows
10 yeah is how unresponsive the Start
menu is here let's do a test Angry Video
Game Nerd let's just see example click
look at that how delayed was that how
can you handle that
oh that bugs me so much and it worked
it doesn't even always work like compare
that to spotlight on OS 10 spotlight is
awesome why isn't this awesome
okay so spotlight spotlight is there
system wide search oh oh I've got
another I've got another good one for
you guys I wonder if they fixed this
okay is that delayed again Rufus that's
weird
we've got Rufus the band we've got Rufus
Wainwright the smaller band and then
we've got some US searches okay
let's do an experiment let's go look at
my downloads folder oh boy you know what
let's wait to look at my downloads
folder
oh crap I don't have it in there okay
well whatever it does you're not
actually searching for some reason oh no
no I am oh okay you're leaving that
thing yeah yeah I'm doing my other thing
okay
so I'm gonna I'm gonna work on this in
the meantime but anyway it makes me know
I'll be a recent downloads it'll
probably work
I'll see no no no no it specifically
doesn't find this Rufus is ever though
Rufus is awesome I like you already
in your downloads folder okay okay so
let's try this again so now I definitely
have Rufus in my downloads folder
what is all this okay Rufus definitely
still not there now let's go back to my
downloads folder where Rufus Hey right
there hold on
where Rufus definitely is and yet Rufus
is definitely still not coming up it's
in the Downloads folder it's not like it
like flk we're talking like it's an
agent trying to make a smart search you
just downloaded it like it's an
executable if we're not talking some
executable and Program Files or
something like that where there's like
some kind of a risk factor involved here
we're talking it is specifically
presumably intentionally because I can't
even imagine something like this not
well I can imagine it not being fixed
but come on my like super jacked out
version of Windows 8.1 definitely would
have found that uh yeah any other
version windows 98 would have found that
yeah even with the stupid dog oh wait
the dog didn't come till XP it would
have found it so mad it would have taken
a while yeah but it would have found it
makes me so mad people are probably
explaining it to me in twitch chat file
extensions enabled yeah anyway it's not
a bug it's a feature yeah I'm sure it is
don't hate the dog oh the dog was pretty
bad
the dog was pretty bad anyway
what's our what were we even talking
about oh yeah Windows 10 and how you're
still not gonna use it
yeah oh you know what else we should do
while we're screen sharing with me is we
should go through what's new on playing
club yeah do you want to give owed I
call it club sorry oh well you did it's
already called it's still called it up
there I need to change but we're
changing that yeah so the floatplane
domain I know we kind of jumped the gun
announcing that we have flow playing
calm cuz we had like reached an
agreement but didn't technically have it
transferred to us yeah yeah we
definitely have it now yes right yep
yeah okay yep definitely okay yeah you
can even like who is it cool I mean it
has the information like nope what oh ah
really
yep oh oh give me a second really yeah
no no I just mean that didn't work yeah
I don't know why but who is and then the
domain in a google search it didn't work
like what are using Bing oh man I I wish
I had I wish I had screenshot did
something the other day because I was
searching Bing for something and it was
astonishing how worthless the results
were and then I searched google for it
was like yeah right there yeah yeah
you can't like tell that it's us cuz oh
yeah that's what I meant but asking you
had domain privacy in it but it all
moved over and yeah see there's a new
expiration date cool the update date was
like around when we were talking about
it so do you want to like tell people
anything cool about about the domain or
like what's going on um there's two guys
that are emailed today I asked so that I
can find out two to hopefully talk to
them about getting hired so that's
exciting that's cool
so they both seem very skilled one of
them is in Canada one of them is in the
US I'm sort of sad about the u.s. one
because hopefully you come through and
take the job because that would be
wonderful but it's gonna be a little bit
hard to get you up here but not as hard
because you have a degree which is very
helpful because Canadian law with the
partnerships that we have with the US
makes it so that you can immigrate to
Canada much more easily if you have a
degree which is awesome so if you want
to
okay that fits fine and you don't have
to become like a full Canadian ditch
your American passport thing you can
just come up here and work which is
great and then the other guy is from the
east a bit much more closer to one of my
other developers but yeah hopefully he
will join as well that's all going good
lots of new design stuff has happened
not on this laptop so I can't show you
but there's going to be a blog post
going on to the floatplane section of
the forum soon that shows a lot of the
new design stuff we've done some fairly
drastic things in terms of design I
can't show you guys right now but I was
named do you not want to show them I'm
down do you have it
I should have the the email you sent me
what did you call it though I think it
was like a one word subject line as
you're Luke I do that yeah there's a
thing that I do
I like be able to read the whole subject
line in one line when it's on a phone
yeah yeah it's not very SEO optimized so
I mean the forum is though yeah yeah and
the website will be once it's live okay
is it it's probably like full playing
concept images and
killing me here just look for emails
from me yeah I guess I don't get that
many of those these days yeah okay sorry
I'm working on this do want to do
another topic in the meantime sure yeah
and then we'll talk about them briefly
here but I'll talk about it much more in
depth in the post on the full paint
section on the forum once that goes live
and we'll like answer questions there
and stuff FLIR cameras oh this is bad
have unremovable backdoors this is
really bad a security researcher has
discovered secret hard coded backdoor
accounts in thermal security cameras
manufactured by FLIR Systems the
accounts are never exposed to the front
end user and cannot be changed through
any normal operation of the camera
certain now publicly username password
combos will grant an attacker access
over the device publicly available
ouch so so FLIR needs to get this
together yeah I do these companies build
in backdoors other vulnerabilities
stream disclosure attackers can access
the security cameras stream without
needing to authenticate remote root
exploit attackers can execute code on
vulnerable cameras with root privileges
authenticated OS command injection
attackers with access to limited
accounts can inject command and have
them executed with root privileges
multiple information disclosures
attackers can access slash query certain
camera files and read other local
resources the researcher reported
vulnerabilities to FLIR but has not
received a response regarding the issue
great the easiest way for FLIR can't
customers the easiest way for FLIR
customers to protect themselves is to
prevent access to their cameras from the
internet by placing the devices behind a
firewall until the vendor issues a patch
brilliant suite
yeah That's not me oh really and I can't
possibly understand who the heck else it
could be huh all right because I'm the
only person that it makes sense for but
I've never heard of them and neither has
boiler okay I have me I have the
mock-ups up are these all this is some
of them I mean we don't just show
everything you're still gonna do the
blogpost right yeah yeah okay so um well
this is the pub like bottom half dang it
it's not in a particular order okay so
yeah yeah it might not be great to show
the front is it can you all the way up
this is the full one and it's like super
Pixley yeah why does this look so trash
okay so we're just gonna download those
and move on but yeah come on what that
was posted by Doctor Who 1975 on the
forum thank you very much for posting
that I'm gonna post the bleeping
computer article in the twitch chat so
you can all go pitchfork about it
because you probably should actually
yeah that seems like a very valid thing
to think this is terrible
oh it's horrible we got security cameras
you can't have you can't have security
backdoors and security cameras that's
like it's like punching a hole in your
security before you ever put in security
that's super guards exactly what
happened actually super super guard oh
you should have your security cameras
behind a firewall and then have to VPN
in to see them but not everyone will do
that right and like this should have
been disclosed and is completely BS and
the fact that you should have your
security camera set up that other way
doesn't matter in regard to this because
this shouldn't have happened
anyways wow this is like the world's
worst screenshot this full of front page
one
it's just super Pixley yeah it's like
okay I'll put up a not super pixelated
version kind of show it for now
yeah okay so it's pretty similar to the
original front page that we showed you
guys but with some changes on the lower
part yeah first spoiler there's the new
logo that we have hold on but this is a
trash version so we might want to show
them the logo on one that isn't so
pixelated yeah but that's the new logo
that we have yeah the top part hasn't
really changed at all there's been minor
changes to the creator tiles right here
those are just randomly generated names
so don't worry about it cool I did check
with that this section has changed a
fair amount um there were concerns that
the previous version wouldn't be able to
scale on two different devices yeah this
version is set up so that it can scale
properly on two different devices which
is good and I'll talk more about the
front page somewhere else cool
next one any of the main pages I'd say
what would you consider to be a main
page we can go with that one
I'll based examples sure cool so this
one as some stuff going on this is just
an example page of how tiles can work
and the tiles would obviously have like
videos on them or pictures or something
yeah they wouldn't just be like purple
gradients so it'll look more lively and
interesting yeah but that was just an
example the main thing that I want to
show you guys here is actually this
one's not a good example for it can we
there we go that's a much better example
for it this again those are just empty
blocks and none of those blocks are
staying where they are so completely
ignore that it's actually gonna just be
one big section called not three
sections so don't worry about that but
the main thing you might notice is
there's no top bar top bar a bit of a
controversial change but I think it's
really good I like it
we want floatplane to be a home for the
creators that are on floatplane yeah so
we want to get out of their way as much
as possible and so we get this real
estate here yeah
and this here yeah and then we're out of
the way we just wanted to serve the
content we want to make sure
all your stuff is fine and then you get
the whole right side of the screen and
our stuff will never touch you and etc
etcetera etc you're all good on your own
which i think is really cool here's some
terms and conditions trying to make them
look kind of friendly yeah that's the
whole front page and one in one view
that's like an example of what an about
page might look like yep so there's like
staff tiles down at the bottom so you
can have like the people that work on
your channel or like affiliated channels
or something there
whatever you kind of want to put there
that's just the bottom of the site so in
terms of content that we have over there
right now man it's been kind of a crazy
week actually okay what do we got
we've got tech wiki what happens if you
don't shut your computer down properly
we've got overkill office upgrade this
one actually went up on YouTube today
but has since had its thumbnail changed
but that doesn't really matter we've got
the ultra wide festival video oh what's
up Luke was wrong calm oh my god even
just landing on the page is amazing holy
crap that's a really good screenshot
when is that even from that's not now
it's that mod 24 like what is this maybe
I've got that like the the mic with the
middle it was wrong powered by
Squarespace oh man just the font and
that screenshot like home look I look
like slightly dazed and I'm just wow
terrible Wow so good alright what else
what else we got here uh we've got
iPhone 8 Nate Plus review so that's a
thing oh that's exciting yeah that'll be
coming to YouTube pretty soon we've got
oh we've got part two of turning LG's
wallpaper TV into a win this thing's
crazy
Horsham we've got it's finally up
testing the almost sli setup I didn't
notice that was there loading screen
capture really love old games running
yes so we used an HDMI to our we used a
VGA to HDMI adapter and then used our
capture cards okay yep it looks really
good cool that's really cool we've got
the set destruction vlog oh geez
that's up so this is us tearing down a
lot of the old sets you should tell them
what cards are in that SLI vo yeah
they're Voodoo's yeah well yeah so it's
it's awesome we've got scrapyard wars 6
part 2 and very soon like this weekend
part 3 or 6 part 3 and part 1 is
obviously also there and there's a lot
of good stuff on there right now I think
that's pretty much the bulk of it yeah I
don't know if handy tech under 100 stuff
for your stuff is on YouTube not 100%
sure about that one but yeah scrapyard
Wars is is the other big piece that is
not on YouTube yet
alright leading us back to I don't know
is there anything else to talk about
this week what even happened
I don't think stuff for your stuff as
all yet is yep um a you optronics is
roadmap is on TFT central so
27-inch 3840 by 2160 fill 4k monitors at
144 Hertz already planned for several
monitors which we know because we've
done pieces on two of them three of them
two of them one a suits one back at CES
and one Acer one at their show in New
York but production has been delayed
until November 2017 and those displays
are not expected till q1 2018 a 32-inch
version 4k 32 inches 144 Hertz that's
pretty dope not planned until q3 2018
with displays not likely till q4 to 40
Hertz refresh rate TN panels Oh
now up to 1440p wow that's pretty killer
Evans has 1440p at 240 Hertz is doable
in eSports titles not that eSports guys
necessarily care but nuts
is what it is ah they've got a 120 Hertz
35 inch VA 1440p coming and they've got
a 35 inch VA 34 40 1440 200 Hertz with
full HDR but it's delayed until q2 2018
yeah so I guess that's uh yeah so that's
when you're gonna see monitor videos
coming from us okay
this sort of matters this was posted by
space reptile on the forum and this is a
rumor right now but it is route this is
a rumor about a product that is rumored
so it is rumored that a gtx 1070 TI is
coming and i can tell you guys honestly
i don't know one way or the other I
haven't heard a damn thing it is also
rumored that the 1070 TI because the
rumoured specs looked really close to
the 1080 TI like it was going to be kind
of stepping on it a little bit it is
rumored that the specs are are true but
that in order to keep it from
overlapping too much with the 1080 Ti it
will not be overclockable can you
imagine Nvidia having the I mean I want
to say audacity okay arrogance I'm gonna
throw in potentially an unpopular
opinion here I would be I'm not but I
would be completely okay with this if
they called it something else if it
wasn't a ty ty has always been like hell
yeah like every time a ty has come out
it's been like a nicer kind of more
powerful push it further kind of card if
they called it something else I would
maybe be okay with it cuz there's a lot
of people that are gonna overclock the
cards anyways so if they're like I can
save some money by this thing not
overclocked Excel wasn't planning on
doing anyways that's fine
but if you knew they were non
overclockable versions I don't think I'd
care that much interesting but it's a
tie they're not telling you this so
basically in video
it says all rumors well and yeah if this
is true in video we're basically be
coming out and saying well our
competitor can't compete with this
anyway so what does it I would like to
think pay more get more not bend very
well for overclocking I don't think is I
know yeah no I know that no there's no
way do you think there's gonna be BIOS
flashes that allow you to overclock them
I doubt it I mean that has been a thing
on the AMD side but it's never really
been a thing on the nvidia side of
things this was originally posted by AG
1 233 razor is teasing its first
smartphone with the reveal apparently
coming on november 1st so in a surprise
to absolutely no 1 min Langton wears
jeans and a black t-shirt all the time
no you're thinking of Jensen oh right
and the phone will have a bright green
logo on the back of it ok I can make
some other guesses about the phone do
you want to hear sure it will have a
1440p display it will use a Snapdragon
835 processor I don't have yet it will
be available with you know what I'm
gonna say 64 gigs in storage and it will
have microSD expansion you know I bet
you the Front's gonna be blocked it will
have volume buttons those might be green
it will be cloud ones of what yeah yeah
yeah those so they acquired what was it
next bit was the company called next bit
who made the Robin so-and-so Nick was
yelling that they could be pushing all
the storage into the cloud I doubt it
though its razor they probably just
threw some down flash chips in it I mean
what else what else can i what else can
i guess about it the phone I'm guessing
will be hello mediocre because unless
you've invested literally a decade of
research into smartphone camera stuff
you're gonna end up with like an
off-the-shelf thing and really that's
what makes Google's phone and Apple's
phone and Samsung's phone better as the
processing now
not necessarily the sensei so ones like
RGB screen TV screen yeah it's the
screen is gonna be RGV up the but they
should have a mode that's like the like
night clock mode that some phones have
do you know what I mean
you put in like clock mode yeah yeah but
instead of that it has like bold numbers
so you can see them that are all black
yeah and then all the rest of it is like
bromide to hell yeah you gotta sleep
with those multiple colors on your face
all right do you want to talk about
oculus stuff um not really
wow that kind of says it all doesn't it
yeah there's two new headsets coming out
one's called it go one is currently
called Santa Cruz but I'm assuming that
name will change
LIGO will cost $200 we'll ship next year
early next year you sounds so dead man
apparently will fit the sweet spot
between rift and other portable
smartphone powered VR devices as it's
believed it's a high-quality affordable
experience that doesn't tether you to a
PC it is the most accessible VR
experience ever nice it has positional
tracking on motion controls but its
powers this is I'm talking about the
Santa Cruz now to be clear that's good
has positional tracking on its motion
controllers but its power is more on the
level of a gear VR meant to be more
accessible than rift cool and ultimately
point the way forward toward mainstream
VR now to be fair things need to be
accessible and desktop VR is super
intensely not accessible right now yeah
you need big areas to to actually play
on these things you need powerful pcs
it's not affordable it's not accessible
it's not easy to set up it's annoying
etc etc etc it's not gonna push
mainstream like it like it hasn't it's
been good in the enthusiast space I know
there's a lot of people that are still
really enjoying their VR setups and
there are some really cool games for it
that's great
other applications
definitely but ones that work fine with
a seated experience the stuff that's a
drastic shift or change in terms of
technology needs to be accessible for
wide market to actually accept it like
the Wii was really weird
in terms of gaming devices but it was
cheap there's like 200 bucks for the
console I bet you most people bought it
at about the 200 ollar price tag even
the games that weren't like smash hit
triple-a titles like one of the most fun
things on the Wii was Wii Sports that
came with it and it was fun because you
could does it all the time to screw
around if the whole family could get
involved whoever comes over could get
involved within seconds yeah understand
the game be playing and be social really
easily and if you're by yourself you
could just Bowl or do whatever and it
was still fun it needs to get to that
level now technically these are going in
that direction I don't think they're
gonna be enough I don't think they're
gonna work yeah one of the big things
that we had going for it was that it
sold to families a solo experience that
closes you off in the world is not going
to solve the families very well no not
really but there are still definitely a
lot of people that will buy it I
personally don't think that either of
these are gonna be Smash Hits I
personally don't think that either these
are really going to work because I think
VR is still a few years out and right
now the only thing I'm really interested
in is like really powerful VR because I
think we're a few years out from non
tethered experiences being properly
powerful enough so I'm not interested in
these personally alright last order of
business coffee lack coffee Lake oh he
is in very short supply right now it's
unclear whether it's overwhelming demand
or very very very limited supply but it
is pretty much impossible to buy a core
i5 8400 core i7 8700 K yeah they are
they're selling like hot
cakes cakes I was gonna say cax but no
one wants a hot kak
well you might to try and encourage
people to still buy CPUs and tell us
doing a game without compromises bundle
so you get let's see two free games
total war Warhammer - and Assassin's
Creed origins but it doesn't apply to
coffee like it only applies to their
older stuff which sort of makes sense if
you think about it but is annoying some
people because they're like no
compromises would mean getting the best
processor and getting a cool bundle and
then that's pretty much it
anything else for one show for you not
particularly right I'm good then yeah
signing off you guys we'll see you again
next week same bat-time same bat-channel
get subscribed on floatplane watch three
episodes of scrapyard wars this war
everybody else this weekend
yes there will be an after party Dave oh
my oh oh oh uh lick your Street okay
yeah I gotta go I gotta go
we're using the old 10 GPU server thing
over oh not Bitcoin but like a coin yeah
yeah that would actually be a good name
for a cryptocurrency a coin because like
it's irrelevant the branding doesn't
matter yep
no one cares</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
