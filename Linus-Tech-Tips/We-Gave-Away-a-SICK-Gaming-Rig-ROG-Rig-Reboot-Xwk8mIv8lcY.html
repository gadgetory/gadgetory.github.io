first winner here is Josh he had a very
simple request I mean especially in
retrospect it seems like this is the
kind of thing that should be pretty
doable he wanted a white and blue gaming
computer and we got the gaming computer
we've got the ROG gtx 980ti we got the
core i7 7700 k we got water cooling up
the bananas but the case is black this
is my peace offering
can you live with a balls-to-the-wall
gaming computer that's not white and
that I dropped pieces of I think so
good let's get started then
the asus rog Strix 1080 TI features RS
ink RGB lighting with a plethora of
colors and the ability to synchronize
effects across the ecosystem of our sync
enabled products learn more at the link
below your video pretty short pretty
sweet had one of my friends help me
write a script and then grab my sister
and said hey will you help me with this
that's a little awkward not like that
have you ever gamed on a machine of the
caliber of what we're building today
never ha see I get so disconnected from
this stuff sometimes I just like kind of
take it for granted
so then have you ever built a computer
before no I should know that because the
last desktop you had was what 10 years
ago you know you don't even have a
desktop we did at one point but I might
have broken it oh that's a little
awkward are you gonna break the one I
build today no not at all so even just a
little bit broken nope let's try okay so
you got you had a desktop but we're
talking it was like a Pentium 4 or
something
is ancient yeah okay got it yeah oh I
feel old we're off to a good start okay
so how much of the building do you want
to do versus how much of the building do
you want to be like like when I would
help my dad with carpentry I'd like to
do at least a good part of it okay a
good part of it alright I'll pick the
best part okay so the best part here
hold this screwdriver and hand it to me
when I'm ready for it so we're gonna
open up our power supply silver box
right there yes I know it's not it's not
light or blue that's okay like it's
80-plus titanium efficiency which is
like bananas bananas bananas are good
it's 30 they have lots of potassium yeah
we have these also not white and blue
cables from cable mud but that don't
look really good mori it's okay I don't
really care at all that there's no white
case I just think it's funny that Linus
takes it so personally that there's no
white case I don't know if I can work
under these conditions
ten points if you can find the
motherboard in the massive pile of
awesome hardware that you're getting
today nice ten points perfect you
leveled up it's like the beginning of a
game where like you actually don't do
anything you just like look in the right
direction and it's like 25 XP your level
2 now yeah yeah it's it's like that no
see if you installed you can pull that
off okay there you go
hold on to that if you ever had to it
was like let's say you legitimately had
something devastating happen to your
board like critical functionality like
the RGB wasn't working quite right if
you send it back to them without that
cover and the pins get damaged
now that's physical damage its bricked
okay do you want me to do that right now
sure okay I mean you don't have to I
can't force you to do anything you could
just leave I could but I won't
there you go at first you didn't got it
but then you got it yes now you don't
got it that is true okay so that looks
pretty good so far
next stage is we actually move on to the
not white but still very good case look
I'm showing you how to build the
computer I can see it in your eyes
you're super disappointed it's not white
I'm just getting really tired of how
much pressure you're putting on me about
the parts not being waiting sorry here
I'll stop no pressure but this is the
part where you either kill your
motherboard or it's fine oh that's
stressful no no it's not stressful at
all don't worry you know the one funny
thing about this though to me is that we
didn't choose an rog board for the build
Oh white and blue you got this yeah it
always does that it's kind of annoying
it's like they were determined to have
the logo upside down on their water
cooler in this case all right well I'd
recommend tubes up because then it
doesn't run across the graphics card so
I usually recommend a pull orientation
on a radiator you familiar with
push-pull yes the reason for that is
that when you have the fans pulling air
this way this is really easy to clean
you just kind of go like this
and you take some cat hair or whatever
and you tuck it in the garbage when you
turn these around the air goes through
this way well now you have to take your
fans off let's face it last time you had
a desktop with ten years ago this thing
could be running for ten years we got to
be ready for this stuff okay
what matters more to you your precious
blue color scheme or cable management I
just need to go get something really
quick here this completely definitely
new h100 IV - that definitely we didn't
pull off the shelf because our shipment
didn't get here in time which definitely
has nothing to do with why your color
scheme isn't right definitely isn't
missing some of the hardware so I'm
definitely not going to go over there
and get it fantastic
cooling done and without any mishaps
whatsoever all right let's do a hard
drive oh sorry it's in that box I was
just getting this one out of your way
he's like wait that was the motherboard
I knew that I showed him I knew that
yeah it's not going and just force it a
little you know just give it the old
force it so we've put it right there
nope nope nope I think the white goes
better with what's currently inside wow
you can't just pick a color without
taking a shot at me for us not getting
it right you can't even do that and it's
time for the graphics card so naturally
I'm gonna let myself do the honors come
on be a man open it with your teeth yes
you ready oh and and a CD that's it
that's what the highest performance
graphics card on the market looks like
if you'd be gentle GeForce GTX 10 atti
Strix overclocked so I'm gonna get you
to unbox your nice cherry IMAX
mechanical gaming keyboard your mouse
pad your mouse your monitor there you go
are you wearing your mousepad yes
excellent here we go go ahead press the
button oh that's a bad sign
no I'm just kidding I didn't turn the
thing on your RGB is lighting up so the
most important thing about the system is
already working which is great so we are
going straight for static color blue
what you have gotta be kidding me
it's ROG everything's red the
tablecloths red you just be happy with
Reds there we go see I told you this was
a white and blue themed build would I
ever lie to you Josh never what do you
plan to do with your new rig I want to
run some games probably will buy rocket
League because I love that game I just
played at my friend's house is all the
time
right I also might want to do some video
editing and get into that more because
I'll have something that can run
something other than write a potato
okay so color scheme 5 out of 10
performance 11 out of 10 11 out of 10
very good good answer
building my first gaming PC was pretty
difficult nah it really wasn't it was
pretty simple all right well I'm glad
and thanks for tuning into our og rig
reboot all of you guys out there and a
huge thanks to Josh for entering and why
am i thanking you a huge you're welcome
to Josh for getting this fricking
awesome computer courtesy of a soos who
else contributed to it Corsair helped us
out with it Intel Nvidia helped Seagate
all good stuff so uh congrats man enjoy
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
