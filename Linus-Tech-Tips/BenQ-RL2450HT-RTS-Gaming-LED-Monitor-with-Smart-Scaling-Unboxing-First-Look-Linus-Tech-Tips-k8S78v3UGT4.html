professional level RTS gaming monitor
endorsed by the one and only these guys
who play for Korean they are okay
they're members of a Korean eSports team
we don't know which one that is and I
don't know who they are so um supposedly
though they are probably pretty good
because at this point in time I have not
yet had my picture on the box of a
product so if they can do it then they
must be better at video games than me
which is not saying much but I'm sure
they're really good okay anyway so it's
optimized for RTS one earth does that
even mean it has a couple features that
you might find relevant so first of all
let's get this out of the way this is a
TN monitor so this is a speed optimized
rather than color and accuracy optimized
monitor that shouldn't say accuracy
because I mean a pixels a pixel you
don't exactly it's not like one monitor
is like blurrier than another one but by
accuracy I mean mostly the color
accuracy the vibrance TN panels are
usually plenty bright but you tend to
have less contrast so your whites are
darker your blacks are lighter however
what you get for all of that because
you're doing very little processing to
the image and you are using a faster
less accurate panel is you get the quick
Grady gray response times that gamers
often ask for so this panel is rated at
2 milliseconds grade of gray which means
that for gaming if you're upgrading well
hard to say that's an upgrade because a
lot of those CRT guys are like neuro
nothing is an upgrade to a CRT CRT is
the best technology ever um which it
might be but it's hard on the eyes if
you are upgrading from a CRT to this
particular monitor you are going to
notice less input lag and less of a
overall delay between the screen
refreshing and it not being as refreshed
as it is
so that is to say that it is a sixty
Hertz panel and in between one of those
flashes in a second and the next one
you're gonna see less less blurriness as
well as less lag so here we go just
gonna take this off what else makes it
RTS optimized you might ask and I would
tell you that what's kind of cool about
it and this is one of the reasons that
Intel is actually using this particular
display for tournaments is that it
includes a mode that allows you to your
real ah bah blah blah black equalizer
for optimum visibility oh that's that's
actually interesting okay this is a cool
feature out of everything I'd say this
is probably one of the biggest ones so
what they've done is they've optimized
the output of the display so while
you're not gonna get necessarily the
best color or whatever else is gonna be
fast and you're going to be able to
clearly see details in the dark so
they've tweaked it a little bit so that
when you have like a you know let's say
you're playing an RTS and you have sort
of a fog of war or whatever type less
visibility area of the map you'll be
able to see the units
what kind of units they are as opposed
to just seeing sort of black shapes
moving on top of a black background and
then all of a sudden they're in your
base and you're in trouble so that's
kind of neat and then this guy right
here so this is why Intel is and
actually a lot of tournaments are
starting to use these BenQ monitors
right here so you can switch between
display modes so you can virtualize a
17-inch 19-inch 19-inch y 21 Y 22 wide
or 23 wide monitor on the surface of
this one without actually changing the
panel you're using so this will allow
you if you are you know a competitive
gamer and you're playing at home it will
allow you to practice in the setting
that you're going to be using at a
tournament so at the resolution at the
screen size you're going to be using
this can be an advantage and it also
allows them to have flexibility when
they use these for tournaments to set it
to whatever they want depending on the
game that is being played so what else
we got here sixteen by nine widescreen
viewing height adjustment okay so love
yeah let's have a look at the overall
aesthetic of the monitor so we've got
our rotation we got our lips today's
huh okay we've got our I think this
one's called pivot pretty sure it's
called pivot it goes only one way so it
goes this way so you can be in portrait
mode and play like Starcraft in like
ultra stretched portrait mode if you
want but that's stupid don't do that
we've also got a height-adjustable stand
this is nice Ben Q is one of them
honestly Ben Q really has I believe set
the bar in terms of the overall
usability of their monitors because even
on their lower end monitors and you can
tell what it's a lower end monitor
because it'll tend to sort of not be as
robustly built as the higher end
monitors and I'm not knocking them I'm
just saying you know you get what you
pay for even on a lot of their lower end
monitors their still including things
like a height adjustable stand and
proper ergonomic adjustments and I think
that is critical because everybody needs
to be comfortable looking at their
monitor and being able to adjust it oh
yeah it also tilts this guy right here
being able to adjust it is instrumental
in that so I would rather have a
slightly less built up stand that
actually has all the adjustments versus
having one that looks really great and
is like made of metal and it's like
beautiful and like brushed finish but
actually like you can't move anything so
there you go there's my two cents about
that I include the VGA cable would have
liked to see a DVI cable included but
yeah it's neither here nor there I
suppose on the bottom we've got VGA DVI
and HDMI in as well as a headphone out
port so if you are using HDMI then you
can listen to your audio and your
headphones there we've also got an AC
power adapter plug spot as well as a
Kensington lock up here last but not
least this is a visa compatible LCD so
if you wanted to put it on something
then you could do that you could just
take it right off the stand that it
comes with and put it on something else
so I think that pretty much covers it
for me at this point in time thank you
