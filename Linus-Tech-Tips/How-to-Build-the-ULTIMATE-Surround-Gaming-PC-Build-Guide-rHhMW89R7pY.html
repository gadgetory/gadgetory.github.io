some limitations the monitors are quite
expensive for anything but a TN panel
text scaling within windows particularly
while maintaining the sharpness and
clarity you'd expect from a 4k screen is
still a challenge
and finally they mostly just sit in
front of you rather than wrapping around
yes video card support for multiple 4k
displays is still pretty iffy so that
leaves the aspiring surround gamer in a
bit of a pickle 3 4k monitors is beyond
impractical requiring a graphic setup
forged in the fires of Mount Doom
and while triple 1080p subs are both
relatively inexpensive and easy to drive
they aren't exactly cutting edge anymore
but there's another option with the way
that 2560 by 1440 27 inch monitors have
dropped in price nowadays you can snag a
few of them for around a grand which
means that the only remaining question
is what kind of gaming rig are you going
to build to power it so let's get to
building shall we welcome to the
ultimate surround gaming build guide
before you begin find a safe static free
workstation and equip yourself with an
anti-static strap I like to keep mine on
my ankle to keep it out of the way now
all we really need for assembly is a
multi bit screwdriver but a pair of side
cutters and a pair of pliers can come in
handy from time to time another thing
that we're going to need for this build
that's a little unusual is I'm going to
have my eye fix-it toolkit because we're
going to do things like taking apart RAM
modules now before you actually begin
building the rig I always recommend
plugging the components in and powering
the system up once outside of the case
to ensure that everything is working
well it's nice and easy to reach and
swap out components if you need to the
motherboard box makes a handy non
conductive test bench if you don't have
one already for our CPU we went with
Intel's latest technology the core i7
4790k codenamed devil's canyon doesn't
really change much from the previous
generation core i7 4770k codename has
well but due partly to improvements in
the thermal interface material between
the die and the heat spreader it
promises lower temperatures and a more
consistent overclocking experience I
guess we'll have to push the system a
little bit once we're done to see what
we can squeeze out of it so hold your
CPU by the edges and identify the corner
with the little gold triangle align that
with the corner of the socket that has a
plastic triangle indent on it it should
be the bottom-left lift up the retention
arm pull back the socket cover carefully
place the CPU into the socket no force
should be required for this step then
lower the socket cover lower the
retention arm and secure it with the
hook in the bottom right corner the
plastic cover should pop off on its own
choosen memory was really tough for this
build
not because we needed special
performance Ram or because there's a
lack of great memory brands but rather
because no one makes acid green memory
to go with our build so we settled on an
old favorite and we're using a 32 gig
kit of corsair dominator Platinum's at
21 33 megahertz c9 but with a twist
first we disassembled the top bar by
removing the two screws at either end
with an eye fix-it screwdriver then we
fashioned a stand and put a few coats of
black plastic upon all the silver top
pieces next we did a couple of coats of
green plastidip blazed on the acrylic
light bars for a stealthy green accented
look that should complement the rest of
the system very well with that done all
that's left is to pull back the tabs on
the memory slots align each module
according to the notch on the bottom of
the stick and the key in the socket and
press firmly on both sides until the
latch closes bill one set of
color-coordinated slots before the other
two if you're only using two sticks the
case decision for this rig practically
made itself I recently reviewed the NZXT
h4 40 found it to be fantastic and
resolved to use it in a build guide at
some point then this Razer Edition came
along and took the original case added
some tasteful Razer themed accents like
the logo on the front and green LED
lighting in place of the usual white for
the i/o illumination at the back the
glossy accent and power supply cover and
yeah I had to use
start by putting both side panels in the
original box
conveniently NZXT includes retainers so
you don't have to find somewhere safe to
put the thumb screws while you work take
out the rear 140 millimeter fan by
removing the four screws then put these
aside and then remove the front bezel by
popping it off from the bottom there's a
magnetic fan filter here put that away
for now as well we'll need it again
later remove all of the three and a half
inch drive cages to get at the three
front 120 millimeter fans remove their
screws from the front then pull them out
the side now what we're going to do is
replace all four of these fans with the
appropriate size BitFenix Spectre Pro
green LED fans to match the rest of our
build first install the 140 millimeter
fan at the back with the lead in the
bottom right corner and trailing across
the motherboard tray then slide the
three front 120 millimeter fans into
place so their power leads are on the
bottom right if you're looking at them
from the front of the case then use the
same screws we took out to mount them
back in the front put the fan filter
back and pop the front bezel back on now
as much as a soos would love for me to
tell you we chose the saber-tooth z97
mark 1 4 it's cool firmly controlled fan
profiles it's SATA Express port for
future SSDs or it's one touch easy
overclocking that would be a lie this
was all about the looks the clean looks
enabled by this board's plastic thermal
armor covering made it the only z97
board that made any sense in this build
aesthetically I mean I guess the
five-year warranty on top series boards
didn't hurt matters either but that's
why we went with it so from the box
you'll need the board itself the i/o
shield two SATA cables and the manual
and optionally the dust covers for any
PCI Express Ram or other slots that you
aren't planning to use for your system
start by pressing firmly on all four
corners of the i/o shield at the back of
the case until they snap into place then
since NZXT pre installs the correct nine
standoffs for ATX motherboards you can
just lower the board into the case
putting its middle mounting hole through
the post that takes the place of one of
the normal standoffs be sure while doing
this not to crush the wire for the rear
case fan or accidentally
lock your top PCIe slot this post will
hold the board in place while you screw
in the other eight standoffs here here
here here here here here and here while
you still have easy access to the board
plug in the front power and reset
switches as well as the power and drive
activity LEDs follow up by plugging the
block style connectors for USB to front
audio and USB 3 plug in the SATA data
connectors as shown then finally connect
all of your fans will use the three
headers on the bottom edge of the board
for the front fans and the right edge
header for the rear fan this lets us
take advantage of a Seuss's excellent in
BIOS fan control to keep the system both
cool and quiet originally I had planned
to use a dual 140 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooling unit for this build but
Swift tech called me up three days
before I started scripting it and told
me they finally have the successor to
the age 220 ready the h2 20x it features
a more powerful more reliable pump and
enthusiast grade block interchangeable
color plates and finally unlike most
all-in-ones it's expandable if you want
to add more blocks or radiators so we'll
start by changing the color plate to
match the system better remove the four
plastic pushpins and black cover swap
out the included plate for the green one
in the box to match our system better
then put the cover and pushpins back in
optionally at this point the cooling
system can be drained the tubing can be
shortened and the fluid can be replaced
with green hydrants to better match the
system since the h2 20x uses standard
enthusiast grade tubing and fittings and
has a refillable reservoir on two
mounting swift tech ships the h2 20x
with LGA 1150 mounting hardware
pre-installed so all you need to do is
unscrew the four thumb screws remove the
adhesive covers on the backplate stick
it to the back of the motherboard like
so apply the included thermal compound
to the middle of the CPU about the size
of an uncooked grain of rice screw the
top hold down in a cross pattern into
the backplate and plug the power lead
into an asked fan header on the
motherboard
we used the one under this hatch but the
fit might be a bit tight for your liking
the radiator / reservoir / pump unit
will be mounted with the stock fans
flipped around so they're pulling air
through the red then exhausting it from
the top of the case and with the
fittings towards the front of the case
for better clearance between the
motherboard and the built-in pump /
reservoir unit we can pop off the top
bezel the same way as the front then use
the 8 included 1/2 threaded screws to
secure both the fans and the radiators
then we need to finish wiring this bad
boy up the included pwm hub can be
hidden behind the back of the pump it
uses a SATA connector for power and we
can leave this dangling for now the CPU
fan header on the motherboard can be
used for PWM signaling then we plug the
pump into channel one and the fans into
any two other channels so the speed of
all three will be controlled by your
motherboard then we finish up by running
the SATA connector for the pump and
leave that dangling as well normally I
go pretty conservative on power supply
choices for these guides because we
stick with fairly low power consumption
single graphics card setups not today
we'll be loading this bad boy up with a
corsair ax 1200 IAT + platinum fully
modular power supply unit so we'll get
silent operation at idle with the fan
not even turning on and great efficiency
even when we are under full load slide
the power supply in fan side down and
screw the bracket back in at this stage
I usually run all of my power connectors
in Reverse so starting at the
motherboard starting with the 8 pin and
24 pin connectors for the motherboard
and then run them back down to the
basement next up you'll need to modular
SATA cables leave one of them loose in
the basement then run the other one up
through the hard drive area using the
last two connectors to power your fan
hub and water pump after that grab a
modular molex cable for your built-in
case lighting and finally grab four PCIe
power cables for the graphics cards run
those through the cable management
grommets before securing them and the
rest of all of your modular cables to
the power supply don't worry too much
about which goes where because it
doesn't really matter if it fits it's
it's our drive setup is going to be the
standard SSD for OS and key applications
with
hard drive from a storage affair that
has been my go-to for quite some time
the OS drive will be an Intel 730 series
240 gig SSD a drive that offers great
performance consistency and reliability
but since it isn't big enough for a full
game library these days instead of just
going with a green drive for peer
storage we are going to be helping it
out with a four terabyte WD black which
will handle mass storage but can also do
in a pinch for game loading or key
application loading as well undo the
thumb screw on the bottom SSD mount and
slide it towards the window side of the
case to remove it use four of these
screws to secure the drive to the sled
with the connectors facing the
motherboard slide it back into place
secure the thumb screw then plug in the
terminal SATA power connector from the
modular cable that we left in the
basement before and run the data cable
we plugged into a motherboard before up
through the grommet behind the
motherboard and then through the access
hole to plug into the drive next choose
an appropriate hard drive tray I'm going
to use the middle one remove both thumb
screws at the back and pull it out use
these special screws to secure the sled
to the bottom of the drive through the
anti vibration mounts then put the drive
sled back in place and do up the thumb
screws connect SATA power and data in
the same manner as before in our 4k
build guide I went with dual GTX 780 t
is an sli because I figured I could
still get away with three gigs of video
ram not so today at over eleven million
pixels surround two and a half K
monitors have over thirty percent more
pixels than a single 4k monitor so we
went with the best bang for the buck
dual graphics solution from a high
resolution perspective power consumption
and heat output be damned dual Radeon r9
290 s from gigabyte with powerful triple
fan windforce coolers on them these
won't throttle and we might even be able
to overclock them a little bit too I
think these are going to deliver some
amazing performance in this application
now you may have noticed already that
the coolers have a green Plasti Dip
accent on the side this was achieved by
removing the six screws holding the
cooler
from the back then removing the four
screws for the top race that improves
the rigidity of the graphics card I
applied three coats of white Plasti Dip
undercoat and four coats of blazed green
on top I had originally planned to paint
more parts of this build but I felt if I
overdid it it would be overpowering so I
settled on just little accents like this
one I still think that we could have
done better in terms of the green color
here perhaps with a gray undercoat
instead of white but at some point we do
have to film these build guides and stop
thinking around in the garage so here we
are
Oh actually well you've got your GPU
colour off is a good time to replace the
stock formal compound on there as well
but leave all the other stuff like the
the thermal pad to the RAM and whatnot
so now it's time to install them we
simply remove the two PCI slot covers
that correspond to each of our graphics
card slots the top two PCIe 16x slots by
removing the thumb screws position each
card over the slot and when it's aligned
firmly push it into place then put back
the thumb screws that you just took out
plug in two PCI Express power connectors
an eight pin and a 6 pin per card and
for your finishing move I guess step
back and appreciate it because we don't
have crossfire bridges on high-end AMD
cards anymore I don't know what's more
impressive about the aged 440 the fact
that it looks so good from the front or
the fact that it can look so good from
the front while looking so horrible from
the back so it's time for cable
management honestly I won't be doing
much because this system is going to
look great regardless I'm just going to
take everything wrap it up down as tight
as I can because you don't actually have
a ton of space behind the motherboard
tray on this case and I'm going to jam
it all on the basement which is all
hidden by that nice little stealth power
supply cover then we're going to close
up the side panels and call this baby
ready to rock now that the system is
fully built and up and running it's time
to talk monitors now the important thing
here is not necessarily the models of
waters that I'm using while I do love me
some Asus Pro arts and PBS I've got a PA
to 7 9 q in the middle here flanked by 2
PB to 7 8 Q's something with slimmer
bezels might have actually been nicer
for this now the important thing is
the type of monitor that is being used
and how to mount them all somewhat
elegantly all three of these panels run
at a massive 2560 by 1440 resolution and
they're mounted using the modular
expandable triple monitor
ergo text and that I reviewed here
surround gaming isn't for everyone but
if you're into immersion that's a joke
get it into immersion immersion ception
anyway if you want that kind of
experience it doesn't get much better
than this
choosing the peripherals for a colored
themed matched type of build was
actually a little bit challenging since
well normally I would go purely based on
economics performance etc today I have
to try and find good stuff that's also
available in like black and green
Corsair made the keyboard easy
fortunately with their k70 RGB fully
programmable backlit mechanical keyboard
it's well built with a solid aluminum
backplate and made in Germany Cherry MX
switches it looks amazing and the fact
that it can change colors makes it the
most chameleon-like of all the keyboards
which makes it bad acid something anyway
moving on the mouse we've gone with or
that I wanted to go with is a classic
that Razer DeathAdder 2013 with this
high performance optical sensor and
ergonomic design that's available in
both right and left-handed varieties but
what you actually see in front of you
here on the table is a g502 because one
of my employees took the Death Adder
2013 without telling me so I don't have
it anyway for the headset well at that
point I gave up on matching stuff just
by these sweet
Star Wars theme streets by 50 headphones
they're like $200 but they're totally
worth it just kidding check out the
audio sub forum on Linus tech tips calm
for a legitimate recommendation in your
price range although I can't promise
that it'll match your black and green
color scheme now let's take a step back
we made it this far we jumped ahead a
little bit let's talk about the software
setup side of things press delete' while
booting to get into the UEFI bios load
your customized defaults set up your fan
curves and make sure you set up the
header for the illumination on your
water block to run at full speed all the
time so that it's nice and bright and
looks fantastic in your system once
you're done with that
switch to advanced mode in the BIOS for
some CPU overclocking we've got a full
overclocking guide for this CPU which
you can watch here but for now here are
the values that worked well for my CPU
for AI tuner CPU ratio and core voltage
now there's lots of other stuff in here
that you can play with if you want and
I'd recommend starting at Linus tech
tips comm if you want to get some help
from our fantastic community if it looks
a little overwhelming to install your
Windows operating system create a
bootable USB flash drive and then reboot
while mashing f8 immediately to get to
the boot device selection menu where
you'll pick your USB Drive once the
setup process has begun it's basically a
matter of clicking next until you land
on the Windows desktop at the desktop
grab the latest drivers off the
manufacturer websites for your
components go to night comm for your
essential free applications and grab
some stress testing apps and a rivet
tuner derived overclocking utility such
as afterburner to overclock your
graphics cards your mileage may vary but
these are the settings I got these
puppies running yet mmm
mixie so now that that's out of the way
let's find out if our rig here can
actually handle all 11 megapixels of
gaming glory at playable frame rates now
to be clear we were never expecting even
a powerful gaming rig like this to max
out every game at this res at all but
these settings and frame rates deliver a
beautiful and very playable gaming
experience that I think is truly special
well you guys enjoy some glamour footage
of our finished system here I want to
take an opportunity to extend a huge
thank you to Intel for making this video
possible
these build guides are incredibly time
consuming for us to produce and without
sponsors like Intel to foot the bill we
wouldn't be able to set aside the week
of time that it takes for my team to
script film and edit them so thanks
Intel for supporting the DIY folks who
want high-quality guides that enable
them to confidently build their own pcs
I hope you guys enjoyed this video as
much as we enjoyed making it hit the
