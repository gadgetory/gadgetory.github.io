use a test bench instead of a
conventional case let's say for example
you like the look or maybe you swap your
hardware out really frequently or I mean
those are really the main reasons that
you might want to do it anyway we use
tons of them here at Linus Media Group
because we're constantly benchmarking
graphics card CPUs coolers all sorts of
things basically all of our writers have
one or even two or three test benches in
the case of Anthony but as you guys
might know money's been a little tight
around here ever since I broke that Xeon
Platinum CPU so we needed some new test
benches but we didn't have the funds for
these open bench tables that we like so
much enter Aliexpress where we got this
test bench for how much was actually a
little bit under $30 how bad could it be
definitely not as good as our sponsor
for today's video fresh books fresh
books accounting software is custom
built for how you want to work helping
you stay organized and productive try
out their 30 day free trial at fresh
books comm forward slash tech tips we'll
have that linked below
so the open bench table here is pretty
much what we consider to be the gold
standard in test benches it does have
some drawbacks for example their
radiator mounting could be vastly
improved but it's completely toolless
it's really easy to access it folds
completely flat and it fits pretty much
all the hardware that you could want for
95% of the testing that you'd want to do
without any restricted ability to get at
things or any restrictions in terms of
cooling the problem is that I'm going to
do these ones cost $200 $200 it's a lot
of shekels so we've got a static safe
packing foam in here not that I'm too
concerned about any of these things
being sensitive to static we've got some
instructions that are Chinese only but
early pictograph of cold so I think we
should be able to figure it out we've
got front USB that's a and front audio
that's a nice feature to have for a test
bench at the open bench people don't
have it no they don't
Wow remote power button and reset switch
all the included tools and standoffs and
screws and everything not tool that was
amiss I misspoke okay we've got some
extruded aluminum something's there's
five of them
oh and wow that's it this is pretty
flimsy okay so that's not the world's
finest looking piece of acrylic
it's very flex I can't fight this
feeling anymore started fool see they
can't copyright strike me if I'm Way off
key this is really the the
quintessential aliexpress experience
here isn't it
that's kind of like Aliexpress meets
IKEA so first up I've got the hard drive
mounts over here so evidently the hard
drives go in between two of these
kind of something like I'm not sure what
the orientation is yeah it looks like
they go like that how you doing
I opened this upside down and now really
do have meat Anthony oh my god the
screws are labeled and you get they were
numbered all this was gonna be so easy
you screwed us so this is a spectacular
example of waste not want not
so we've got our our bench here and you
can see they actually cut out the
harddrive holders from the rest of the
bench in a spot where the motherboard is
gonna sit on top of it anyway acrylic is
actually a much more expensive than
you'd probably think does it make any
sense to have the numbers on the top or
the bottom so like I look at this and
I'm like oh okay I'll open it up but no
it's like this with this blank piece of
whatever it is we'll let the audience be
the judge actually we shouldn't do that
they always side against me I don't know
what it is no matter how junior or
completely unlikable someone is they
always side with them against me when we
leave it up to the audience okay I'm
gonna put another hard drive on here for
lulz I want to load this thing up like
will will deck it out it will put as
much stuff on it as we can or two hard
drives and an optical drive whoa did you
see that I opened it up correctly
it wasn't even hard oh wow I just huh
there's not really as many pieces on
this whole thing as I had sort of
expected from looking at the like the
diagram are we missing some this is the
light version this is a universal set of
instructions so there's a version that
actually comes with up to a 240
millimeter radiator mount as well as the
PCI Express plane there but we got the
most basic versions oh I think we did
this is where the reputation comes from
China it's not that you're not capable
of designing a tool path for this it's
just that you can't be arsed to just go
double-check this measurement I'll just
put a slot you'll be fine
how do you miss a line your own thing
why is that a slit instead of a hole
acrylic isn't one of those things that
dramatically expands or shrinks when
your laser cutting it so that's pretty
cool check that out so we just run these
cables over to our motherboard and boom
we've got front i/o on our test bench I
mean the thing about a test bench is
that accessing the rear i/o is usually
as simple as turning it around but still
I wouldn't say no to being able to reach
it from both sides
oh wait that's weird no it does say from
the buttons and that was five which you
had these super long ones in for and it
doesn't say for the USB one that's not
labeled whatever reason this one uses a
hole instead of a slot yeah like they
were they were confident on that one so
this is actually a cool design for the
button though so it's anchored along the
outside here and then there's just these
flexible pieces of acrylic that actuate
the button and that's actually got a
pretty decent little clique to it cool
yeah that's really neat
all right the holes are bigger want to
come see the big hole well I put it in
hey this really is not anything special
I've gotten some pretty amazing stuff on
like dealextreme for 30 bucks even
though we paid 30 bucks on Aliexpress
this thing can be had for 16 bucks on
cowbell why did we pay $30 for it on
Aliexpress because it didn't know was on
time Oh wasn't until I followed the tab
out link on that
that their instruction sheet ha so we
actually bought rebranded Chinese crap
from a rebranded Chinese crap
marketplace where several levels deep
right now this is like Soulja test bench
if it goes like any more levels deep
that is not pretty so interestingly
they've actually removed the most
material for our drive mounts from the
area that has the least support from the
feet this this obviously isn't a thing
but then wait yeah yeah everything goes
on the other side really okay well back
to the drawing board
like we're not we're not missing
something here are we I mean we might be
but I don't think so
this too is a protective layer hey so
that's good it makes a little more sense
now so we can go ahead and put some PCI
Express due to Adam a jigs on here so
these are actually very similar in their
design to our open bench table one just
cheaper and crappier now where does this
go there's like these big gaps between
the standoffs and the top here why okay
and then do you know what screws that
uses brilliant doesn't say here's
another bizarre one so there's that
weird gap and then these holes are
hexagonal instead of round why are they
to distinguish them visually okay hey
something makes sense learning a thing
so the hexagon ones are for the the
drive cage things and they can either be
three and a half inch or five and a
quarter inch so here's the other two hex
ones this one is barely even in you can
see there's a gap here and then there's
another set one two three here three and
a half five and a quarter brilliant okay
now I'm just gonna fix that I put the
drives in Rome in fairness to it that's
more solid yeah alright um hold on I got
okay I'll get these so put the standoffs
where they go and I'll screw them in
from the bottom by the time we go
through all this hassle though we could
have done it Luke's way why would they
put the legs right where the holes are
okay at least they got this aligned
correctly now see if I was learning I
would have kicked it hey that's a
legitimate strategy to help prevent
damage I'm not kicking it I'm catching
with my feet look here I'll give you a
demonstration okay so if I were to
accidentally drop this cooler if I'm
like Oh see look how much of its
momentum was arrested before it hit the
ground here it's fine I'll demonstrate
for you again like Oh No Oh
so once your motherboards on like this
then you get your power supply and
honestly this is so stupid
so it just goes on like that oh you guys
are gonna have a full appreciation for
this one side sent it back over
we have to take the board off in order
to mount the cooler because the hard
drives go right under where the CPU
socket is and it doesn't even have a
cutout anyway mm-hmm
yeah and it's not like it has these
stock cooler
it's a beefy stock cooler for like wow
it's like that sucker you like that I
like these more yeah those are awesome
and this doesn't have them well it's
about what you'd expect from just a
piece of acrylic it does get some more
structural rigidity from having the
motherboard like mounted to it but not
as much as it as we want it to have I
mean is this it do we just fire it up at
this point I mean we can if you want to
let's do it we need to plug in the front
panel there we go let's see if the reset
reset switch works it does technically
have a power LED in there so there you
have it this is the geek studio 16
dollar test bench as long as you can get
it off Taobao 30 bucks off Aliexpress it
ain't great and this video is brought to
