and I'm sure you guys have all gone
through this at some point in the past
where you're like building a new system
and like the first part arrives and
you're like oh wow this is so cool to
look at because I have nothing else that
goes with it but then okay it got real
and two of my eBay CPUs arrived
theoretically these are 28 core 8170
sixes or whatever they are something
along those lines I got those then I got
these caddies these are 32 gig modules
these modules have more RAM than what I
would consider to be a high-end gaming
system in one module and I was like no
way now I can test it
thanks to audible for sponsoring this
video
experienced the world's largest library
of audiobooks today with audible and
stay tuned later on in this video for a
special offer I wasn't sure if either of
them would be real or working so I
actually ordered two sets of what
claimed to be 28 core CPUs on eBay and
look at this it's even marked on the
spreaders this is ap 81 36 that the
seller says is a 28 core but then I was
like hey can you send me a CPUs edge
screenshot and they're like sorry I
can't and I was like well can you double
check with someone that it's 28 core
they're like are you code so let's hold
on first let's double check this so
absolutely nothing Intel Xeon 81 36 you
can see I've googled it before but other
than an eBay listing oh oh and there's a
thread discussing that eBay listing and
other people saying that this is really
sketch so this takes up a lot more space
on the bench than most motherboards okay
step number one does this fit yeah cool
if it turns on I'm gonna be turned on
okay so we've got dedicated eight pins
okay dedicated eight pins for each CPU
at that fresh eBay smell that thermal
compound all over it
oh that's good stuff okay so here's
problem number I have lost track but
this is a problem the LGA
36:47 socket has no CPU retention arm
the way it's meant to be held in is by
the cooling solution but almost nobody
is supporting this socket because this
is an enterprise xeon socket intel's
workstation chips are actually using LGA
2066 but with a different chipset
so a seuss went off the rails with this
thing and there's like no coolers to
support it and it's got this bizarro
land mounting system here with like
threaded stuff here in here and then
these posts that are different size here
so I'm hoping to just kind of wing it by
literally holding the CPU in place we're
like the unknown side though random side
no one no one knows what the hell's
going on side including the seller if no
one knows how did you put 28 core in the
listing you're the only people on earth
with this CPU as far as I can tell where
did these come from where did they go
where did they come from cotton-eye Joe
oh this is really dumb what I'm doing
right now okay oh wait okay this is bad
CPU just lifted up okay I got it Jake I
may need your hands at some point okay
what do you think they're gonna boot
yeah I'm going with a definite maybe on
this one too
here we go oh wow that was a whole lot
of nothin pretty anticlimactic oh boy
now most dual socket boards oh okay post
code zero zero that's not generally a
good sign let's think you want to try
the other one of these first or do you
want to try the other chips oh I mean
that's even more jank than I was kind of
hoping to get but oh yeah this is
titanium - totally correct here we go
nope that weren't a good sign Wow crap
okay well hold on a second there could
still be something else let's try the
other chips okay there's some action
they're warming up this time so that's
gonna limit how long I can hold these in
okay go ahead and hit the power my
thumbs burning okay it's time to consult
the manual so it occurs to me we have
actually seen this socket before in our
xeon phi video this is that bizarro
cooler than it used so this gives us a
few more exciting options I don't
actually know if this board is xeon phi
compatible but it's the same socket so
maybe we could try this chip to see if
it fires up then we could try this
cooler on one socket to see if maybe it
is a mounting pressure issue i still got
options oh and of course it's torques
okay this looks like it may not actually
be quite the same cuz there's like a
thing here
and what what is this mounting system oh
this is an arrow ilm this is a square
ilm wrap so we're going for hopefully
enough mounting pressure whoa whoa whoa
hello hello okay that's fine that's fine
we've got a postcode this time though
that's a better sign and also this is
less likely to be CPU one anyway so I'm
gonna put it back where it was right
okay
one long two short great reserved for
future mi codes
perfect brilliant okay let's try a
different that's try different chip
let's try the other one EF
well it could be good as meat as far
okay it's completely different which is
maybe good and maybe bad hi okay so the
manual says one long beep and two short
means no memory detected so we put those
CPUs back in and we're trying the higher
mounting pressure on them okay okay so
kill it okay so let's just put some more
memory in because one of the classic
symptoms of a bad mount in the socket is
that some of your DIMM slots won't work
properly so I mean this is if nothing
else a bad mounting system okay so the
working theory right now is that it's
probably a mounting pressure issue so
last attempt before I just patiently
wait for a cooler I need to get up
higher so I can put more weight on it oh
wow that is terrifying
I just put more pressure on the CPUs and
the system turned on do you want to turn
it off for now
okay I'm gonna put more pressure on okay
let's try the other ones okay send you
down there Center down there okay more
weight I'm good clearing the CMOS no
actually yeah this is the same as before
okay it's been like another week two
weeks I don't know the point is today
was basically Christmas because first
and yes it's only the 19th but it's
still Christmas because first check this
out
so I've got those engineering sample
processors that I ordered when I thought
that Intel wasn't gonna work with us on
this but today I also got
oh look at this oh it's beautiful
so these are Intel Confidential's I
don't remember what SKU these are but
their 3.2 gigahertz base so they're a
lower core count and these ones Xeon
Platinum 81 ATS these are the
top-of-the-line but it was the kind of I
ordered new computer hardware Christmas
where it will cook it there where I
didn't have a piece that I needed still
but then today again these are Intel
thermal solution box coolers for the
Xeon processor scalable family this is
the one active cooler that I could find
on the market for the square ilm socket
I finally have everything we're still
gonna try that eBay processor first I
really want to know if I got ripped off
with how hard this is clamping down
honestly I do not feel like I wasn't
putting enough force on it before I
really don't think that was the problem
so theoretically if these work and I
have two sets of 28 core processors if
they don't and I still have one because
sometimes it's nice to be Linus tech
tips and have Intel send stuff over to
you sometimes do you get sweaty when
you're working on expensive stuff yeah
me too
I need a graphics card Wow so the 81 36
doesn't work now I'm wondering if maybe
there's a problem with our board at this
point so let's try let's try a retail
chip so each of these Xeon 81 80s yes I
think 8 or 10 grand something like that
retail huh no pressure though you know I
mean don't they know that people drop
things
okay so this is with a very probably
known good chip this time
if this doesn't boot up then I have my
doubts about something oh did that just
change yeah does it just have a really
really long post how interesting would
that be what if it has some kind of
first boot process where it has to go
through some kind of detection thing
before it can then boot up properly the
next time and it's really long okay we
are attempting a USB BIOS flash back
with their crash free bios thing we have
a problem though and that's that if you
look at the BIOS revisions here the one
with the higher revision number is dated
earlier than the one with the lower one
so let's pull that out and try again I
wouldn't have thought we could make it
worse but we did 0-0 post code this is
26 66 megahertz 32 gig sticks I wonder
if it's been a ram compatibility thing
this whole time because I've never
actually tried different Ram okay new
plan
we're gonna try the 32 gig sticks from
seven gamers one CPU instead so these
are older slower memory modules these
guys are 21 33 instead of 2400 megahertz
which is like bleeding-edge for servers
right now
maybe we'll see better compatibility if
we try something a little bit older 97 B
to 98 and you know no no no it was just
RAM compatibility oh oh come on no it's
up
Oh sick overclocking yeah yeah I want to
overclock I mean not now I want to get
it like working reliably first but wow
you just keep him in look at them five
bullets no no do I just type in Auto wow
that is jank
oh there they are
56 cars to boot it up okay it still
won't boot into Windows
just a little more troubleshooting it's
finally booted so these are the retail
chips and check this out take that
mother I still haven't tried firing it
up with all the RAM in it this is the
RAM strategy okay two sticks here ten on
the table and I haven't tried any of the
eBay chips because I wanted you guys to
come along for the ride let's find out
if anything works I'm like half excited
and half terrified I really hope these
work because I am almost definitely
passed any kind of buyer assurance
deadline through eBay at this point or
PayPal I really really hope this thing
works now that I've had the board booted
up if this doesn't work then I'm pretty
sure that I got scanned one thing I did
find out is that some of my posting
issues may have simply been related to
memory training and if I had just waited
longer which wasn't something that was
easy to do when I was holding CPUs into
the sockets this is not a solid
indication right now that things are
going to go well though I actually hate
that this TV has like such a pretty
screensaver like when I see a thing
change I'm like hey whoa whoa whoa okay
hold on a minute here whoa
hey they booted genuine Intel CPU zero
thousand percent at flippin brilliant
okay alright let's fire this baby up so
our last CPU got a score of about seven
thousand in Cinebench and that was with
retail eighty one eighty chips I've seen
engineering samples that have more
information than this
but what we do know is the base speed of
2.1 gigahertz we know that they're
twenty eight cores that's really
exciting so these are probably what they
said they were which is eighty-one
seventy sixes yep Xeon Platinum 8170
sixes the eBay gambit worked nice and
these are qualifying samples which I
believe means generally they are pretty
close to retail chips so this is not the
be-all and end-all of benchmarks
certainly but we can get an idea of
whether we're close to what we have with
the retail 81 88 I want to see what it
turbos - not bad not bad at all ok so
that's a significantly lower turbo speed
we were turbo up around 3 gigahertz with
the other one and our lower score does
reflect that but that's a hell of a chip
for what we pay for it now let's try the
mystery meat Platinum 80 136 time is
this a straight-up scam remember this is
the one where the eBay seller was unable
to confirm anything about it unable ok
yeah this is not looking promising so
far it's just been on AF the whole time
you might say it would be
disappointing air dam wonder if I can
still file a dispute here it is chute
turned this item is not there anymore oh
that's not good
can I even leave feedback no I can't I
can't even leave feedback anymore wait
what no view similar items twenty-six
hundred US dollars plus shipping
brilliant so I guess the lesson we
learned then is buying engineering
sample processors off eBay can work or
it can super not but if you order a part
number that doesn't exist at all then
the odds of its super not working from
our sample size of one seem to be pretty
