Computex this year we would not be here
without them also thank you to lynda.com
all right guys we're here at cooler
master suite checking out the cooler
master master case pro/5 and with the
freeform modular system now what the
heck is that we'll get into that in a
moment
when you first look at this case it
looks fairly standard there's a mesh
front panel there's a mesh top panel
there's a filtered power supply thing on
the bottom in terms of i/o you've got
two USB 3.0 ports two audio jacks of
reset button the power button a hard
drive LED light and it's it's really
really sturdy for some weird reason they
let me stand on top of it I would super
not recommend doing this but it
supported my fairly large frame which
was actually kind of impressive just
under the top penalty of a drop mount to
Radiator install so you could take that
radiator mount thing outside of the case
install the radiator there and then put
it back in the case which makes it a lot
easier also the side panels this is kind
of a minor thing but the side panels
when you unscrew them and slide them
back they don't actually just fall off
the case they'll they'll kind of hinge
there for a moment and then they're easy
to remove after that the left side
window has a large kind of square window
cut out for it and there's a little
plate on the bottom which you can
actually remove that plate is for
covering the power supply so if you want
to hide that area or again you can
remove the plate and then show the power
supply whatever you want that's kind of
a sneak peak to the free-form modular
system on the inside you have padded
rails for the power supply and you have
two different kind of Bay areas for the
hard drives you have one that can hold
two three and a half inch hard drives
another one that can hold three three
and a half inch hard drives there's two
SSD sleds which you can have either in
the front of the case or in the back
behind the motherboard tray whichever
one you want and there's a channel for
cable management in the back as well
along with some velcro straps to keep
those cables nice and tidy in terms of
stock cooling you have a 140 millimeter
fan in the front of the case and a 140
millimeter fan in the back of the case
and then for kind of the last feature
we've got in terms of standard features
you have the large CPU cutout but then
we get to the truly interesting part
about this video and that's the freeform
modular system those hard drive bays
that I talked about earlier they install
in a kind of unique way there's a big
circle small circle system on the back
of the case and then some kind of
screw areas on the right which allows
them to install pretty much whatever the
heck they want here yeah hard drive bays
that's fine but not only can you move
them around so you can fit whatever the
heck you want in your case but you can
also install stuff like a graphics card
holder so if you have something like the
Galax 980 Hoff which is very long and
heavy and might droop in your case
despite its pretty nice-looking
backplate you can have something hold it
up so you don't have to look at a droopy
graphics card all the time or you could
install something like a reservoir or
honestly pretty much whatever the heck
you want a big part of the idea here is
that they want to work with the
community so if you have an idea for say
3d printing something like an air
channel they might work with you on that
they can help help you bring that to
market yourself or help your creation
become a reality but it's not just where
the hard drives go you can install a
redundant power supply in the bottom you
can install tempered glass panels which
they're probably gonna have available on
the sides or the top or even the front
of the case it doesn't freaking matter
you can do whatever the heck you want on
the top of the case you can install
handles I know my brother at cold SC on
Twitter would love that he installed the
cross handle on his cosmos - a while
back and they've got stock handles here
you could even stall your own you can
change pretty much whatever you want
some more standard stuff that you might
do is say swapping out the i/o on the
top of the case you can have USB type-c
in the future
they've designed it so it's not really
really hard to remove with things
permanently strapped in you can actually
take that module out and it's no problem
also you could say buy more hard drive
trays or buy more sleds for your SSD
it's not that big of a deal so what's
the point
Coolermaster is doing all this maker
stuff all over the place this isn't the
only maker thing that they have here at
the event and their idea is that they're
trying to unlock what people want there
they're trying to let people run away
with their ideas and that's actually
really cool things in the computer space
can get a little bit dry with certain
cases it's like oh well every single
build that I will ever see in this case
will have a dual radiator in the top
some other basic things and then we're
done the idea here is that they want you
to experiment with things and try things
will actually help you out speaking of
that comments down below let me know
what you want to see in this case
coolermaster will be paying attention
I've got a guy in the background who's
listening to me right now he'll read it
he'll read those comments and he'll
actually intake all of that stuff so if
you want to see something available when
this case is available or in the future
let them know also let me know at
Twitter at Luke
or la Fr thank you again to MSI for
