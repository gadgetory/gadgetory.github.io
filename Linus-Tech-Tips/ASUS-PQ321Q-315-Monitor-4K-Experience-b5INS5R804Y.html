DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts alright so this
video might be coming at a bit of a
strange time if the focus was going to
be on this exact model of 4k monitor
which was first shown off way back at
Computex 2013 and has been available
pretty much since then at around 3,000
to 3,500 dollars an early adopter price
point if I've ever seen one no instead
the focus of this video is going to be
on my experience of using a 4k display
because this is the first time I've
actually brought in the opportunity to
try one in the comfort of my own home
and at work and now that 4k is finally
coming down in price with a Seuss's p b
28 7 q coming at around 800 bucks for a
28 inch model it is a very exciting time
to take a look at this sexy technology
so first I'll give a rundown of this one
this very gorgeous P Q 321 Q that I
guess I can hold hostage now until a su
sends one of the new ones
unlike the low-cost variants that will
feature TN panels of various quality
this monitor features an egg's or indium
gallium zinc oxide based panel there's a
great post actually by a complete
stranger who goes by the handle of Glenn
wing on overclock dotnet linked in the
video description that does a great job
of explaining the benefits of this
technology but in short because in exile
panels controlling transistors are
smaller respond more quickly and can
even be clearer we can get faster
response times higher pixel densities
and more power efficient or even
transparent displays for the rest of the
specs we'll move pretty fast here this
thing is a beast
it weighs 30 pounds much of which is the
robust stand it consumes about as much
power as an idling gaming desktop at
about 80 to 90 watts and it's got a 31
and a half inch 3840 by 2160 LED edge
lit screen with one of the best anti
glare coatings that I've ever seen it's
actually I think the perfect balance
between reducing reflections and still
keeping colors vibrant looking not
scattering the light too much the unit
is super
thin thirty five millimeters at the back
which contrasts sharply with bedell
30-inch monitor that we use for high-res
benchmarking and this thinness is
enabled by an external power brick
versus having an internal power supply
I've seen other reviewers complain about
this approach but I disagree a hundred
percent I would rather take up space on
my floor with big power bricks than
space on my desk which I can actually
use it's not like I'll be moving this
thing around
speaking of movement it has height
adjust pivot and tilt but no portrait
rotate mode you can actually take the
screws off and then put it in portrait
mode permanently but it's not something
that you're going to switch between
easily it has a side mounted DisplayPort
1.2 connector with two side mounted HDMI
connectors it should be noted that due
to the way this monitor works it's
basically like two monitors side by side
with no bezel in between you will need
to use either a DisplayPort device that
supports multi stream SATs 1.2 or higher
or two separate HDMI cables going into
both ports if you want to run the
monitor at 4k 60 Hertz with stronger
DisplayPort implementations in HDMI -
coming soon this won't be an issue on
future models but it is something to
bear in mind here the monitor uses a
sharp exit panel capable of producing
1.07 billion colors with a reasonable
degree of accuracy but with some
tendency towards a roamer a warmer
overall tone to the image it should be
noted that it was never really marketed
as a pro art series for serious color
work so it should still be good enough
for most people the bottoms for
controlling the on-screen display are
around the back and this is unusual but
they actually aren't even labeled on the
front
they're only label on the back of the
monitor it's okay though an optional
sticker is included if you want to be
able to see what you're doing by given
that the on-screen display doesn't have
a ton of useful options like a sousou's
pro art series does I would probably
just leave the front label off for a
super clean aesthetic if it was mine
okay back to that panel type again I've
bent in this view time XO is not
actually strictly speaking a panel type
like IPS or TN and apart from telling us
that it sings o based a soos hasn't been
entirely forthright with what type of
panel is in the PQ 321 Q but on PC
monitors dot info they figure it's an
IPS or similar display
which makes sense given the strong
colors and outstanding viewing angles if
you want more details on the monitor
particularly with respect to color
reproduction for professional work or
more nitty-gritty details of the spec
Anan tected an excellent review of it
which I'll link in the video description
the rest of this video will focus on my
experience using and my thoughts on the
upgrade to 4k so I'll open with this a
bigger screen is not always a great
upgrade
I used a 30 inch Samsung monitor as my
daily driver for a couple of years and
while it was great once I got used to it
scaling back to 27 as I recently did has
actually been just fine too but some
people will always want bigger and
better so if you do want a huge display
then you need to consider pixel density
there was a period of time when many
folks particularly gamers we're buying
32 inch TVs with resolutions as low as
1366 by 768 and then lolling at me at
LANs for paying so much for my 1920 by
1200 24 inch monitor which was obviously
much smaller but that kind of solution
was always very fatiguing for me to look
at if you increase the size but not the
pixel density text and icon sizes are
effectively blown up making everything
look blocky if you increase both pixel
density and size proportionally you get
effectively more of the same level of
detail and same size text and icons but
when you ramp up resolution faster than
size you get a very different computing
experience and everything starts to look
much more crisp or as Apple would call
it retina II at a hundred and forty
pixels per inch the PQ 321 Q is the
highest density desktop monitor I've
ever used by a significant margin about
thirty percent better than a 27-inch
1440p display and it's incredible to see
how sharp everything looks the only
challenge is that while ramping up
resolution gives us more screen real
estate to spread out our work it also
decreases the size of elements now to
the point where it's hard to read text
and click on things accurately unless
the solution to this of course is
scaling which is what Smart OS is like
Android and iOS do but unfortunately
Windows doesn't handle scaling and
amazingly well because even with
improvements in Windows 8 which I
unfortunately don't use yet third-party
software makers need to support it for
it to work properly from within
applications what this means is that if
I leave the scale at a hundred percent
Windows Explorer text has the same
sharpness as text in 7-zip or steam but
if I scale to 150 percent all of a
sudden text in third-party applications
can look terrible by comparison is not
just isolated to these two applications
there are some other things that behave
strangely at such enormous resolution as
well remember that this is effectively
for 16 inch 1080p monitors side-by-side
and stacked with no bezels between them
websites designed for fixed width will
just float in a sea of emptiness in the
middle of your screen and dynamic
websites won't fare much better with
elements stretched out to the edges of
the screen or even just broken outright
one solution to that is to split your
monitor into virtual smaller ones using
third-party software but that'll just
take some tinkering for you to get
things set up the way that you want it
it's just something to think about
speaking of the way you want things for
all the complaining I've done about
scaling and text and whatever else the
4k experience when you're doing it right
when you're enjoying native content is
absolutely unreal it's one thing to see
a 4k TV at a trade show it's another
thing entirely to have one two feet in
front of your play vase playing all of
your favorite games natively at 4k
because PC games
support that stuff as long as you have
the graphics or spot for it it is a
great time to be a PC gamer because of
the improved pixel density I find myself
hardly even needing anti-aliasing
anymore endured three I went from 0 X -
2 X - 4 X so then it got to the point
where I had to have my nose like 6
inches from the screen to see any
jaggies whatsoever when you add to that
the beautiful colors and respectable but
not amazing processing leg on this
monitor the experience is unlike
anything else I've always found that
surround would be OK for me but the
bezel just totally takes away from the
immersion well this it's just fair in
your field of view and it looks amazing
I mean I think the craziest and most
exciting thing about it is that while I
found over 30 inches to be
little bit big this technology is coming
soon to smaller display sizes which
means even higher pixel density and at
lower prices 4k might not matter much to
me for my TV but for my desktop computer
it makes a really big difference it's
like when I moved from 24-inch 1200 P to
30-inch 1600 P all over again it's
absolutely beautiful the one thing I
really need to see though before I'd be
willing to drop 800 to a thousand
dollars on a really nice 4k monitor is
g-sync support I noticed this at
Nvidia's Montreal event when they had
some 4k TV gaming demos running but the
larger the screen the more noticeable
giant tearing artifacts across it are to
me vsync is a solution but it adds more
leg to what I'm already expecting to be
slower than average monitors in this
first round of affordable 4k monitors
Aladdin like tests in any of them yet so
when a soos delivers about $1000 4k 60
Hertz g-sync monitor they will not be
able to take my money fast enough thank
you guys very much for watching like
