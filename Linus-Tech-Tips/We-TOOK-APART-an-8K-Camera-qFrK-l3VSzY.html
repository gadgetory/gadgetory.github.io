about when I was joking around with
Brandon in between shots because the
thing is is that out of the box a red 8k
camera so this is one of their DSM c2
platform cameras or whatever it's got
their helium 8k sensor on it out of the
box
they're super compact to the point where
like it's kind of a miracle that they
managed to keep the things cool because
data moving through them but the thing
is by the time you rig them up with your
external display your big old lens your
couple battery packs your quick release
your what's this thing called your your
top handle whatever else like they're so
bulky that it wouldn't be that much of a
stretch then to like clip a radiator to
it we're kind of joking about this and
laughing and then all of a sudden not
serious
why don't we water cool a camera well I
couldn't think of a reason not to so
here we are and this video is brought to
you by antlion antlions new mod mic
Wireless features a low latency high
quality sample rate LED status
indicators up to 12 hours of battery
life and more check it out at the link
in the video description
so here's the thing I'm not sure if
anybody's ever done anything like this
before even just tearing it down like
when I search for red camera disassembly
I get like a a manual from rocket
rentals something about a Leica M camera
now there's our red epic x5k camera
teardown but extreme tech didn't
actually do it they just grabbed some
photos of the fcc's teardown where they
made sure it complied with all the rules
and regulations and stuff it would
appear that after a cursory google
search anyway we are in uncharted waters
here waters get it
I have no instructions all I have is
this camera body and this iFixit kit and
this my phone because I'm gonna be
taking a lot of pictures as I go here to
hopefully make sure that I don't screw
this up too badly so there's a few
things that we do know we can see that
our main cooling heatsink is right by
this vent here so there's our intake I
believe no that looks like our exhaust
and then here's our intake yeah it says
intake fans right there and so it's
blowing through the body this way and
out that way so the cooling seems to
take place at the back so maybe we could
start back you know what that's let's
start through the body
they're going going bottom up you know I
feel like I need one of those project
mats here we go just make myself a head
okay no well let's did I give up
forget it yeah sure this is gonna be a
system that will work great because
holding the threads like that we will
definitely be able to see how long the
screw is oh okay so this is their
monitor attachment and then this is
David what's this one do okay I don't
know but what that means is that there
could be delicate ribbon cables behind
any pieces that we remove we're kind of
working blind here and we don't want to
pull too hard on things
bloody hell so this is loose but this is
not completely loose yeah we're gonna
need to loosen that alright well the
next thing we can pull off is a mag
holder oh okay
oh wow this actually looks like it might
be simpler than I thought
so this is the the mag reader right here
and it just uses a simple pushing
connector that goes right there and then
that actually gives us access to this
ribbon I think it's this ribbon damnit
it's not that really now some of you
watching from home including even ones
that work at red digital cinema are
probably wondering why would you water
cool a camera what could you possibly
hope to achieve I mean I'm not expecting
any better performance pooling it more
while it could have the potential to
increase its longevity
is not gonna get us more resolution or
more FPS or anything like that so I
guess if I was gonna set out a success
or fail bar for this project it would be
if we managed to make the camera cooler
and/or quieter then I would consider it
to be a massive success because as some
of you will know especially if you've
worked with Reds in an on location
environment or in a setting that's
that's quite hot in between shots
they'll actually ramp up their fans
quite a lot in order to keep the
internals cool like they turn it off
while you're shooting which is good
because you can't have a bunch of Stan
knows while you're trying to record
audio but in between though they'll ramp
them up quite high so if we could find a
way to eliminate that behavior that
would be pretty cool too and aside from
what exactly it is that we hope to
accomplish there are actually a lot of
other things that we don't know yet
either including whether or not this is
even possible or if we are just barking
up a completely empty pointless tree I
mean red wouldn't tell us anything so
the only way for us to find out if the
camera can even have it spooling changed
is to open it up and see for ourselves
I'm starting to get a little nervous
though this is not quite as simple as
just pop off one side and be able to see
oh well there's that warranty void if
removed wait what the hell how did this
come off okay there's our button oh wow
this is not going to be easy
there's a cooling block here that looks
like it's dealing with the bottom side
of this what looks like it should be a
PCB but it seems to be
then there's what appears to be a second
one right here and it's interfacing with
whatever this chip is right here then
there are heat pipes that run down under
this PCB on the side here into this
heatsink right here which is much larger
than I anticipated
like this is a serious machine that is a
significant amount of heat that they're
trying to move away from it
so as far as I can tell the next step is
to remove this PCB and give ourselves a
better look at the heatsink so we've got
a Xilinx x7 a second here what you do
I'm not even gonna try to guess right
now sweating quite literally sweating
right now so this opens to reveal not
scream but some kind of antenna
connector okay so this internal
connector is actually or something to do
with oh wait hey Brandon does the red
have any wireless functionality does it
okay say this presumably is our Wi-Fi
chipset okay so I was kind of worried
about jumping the gun on removing the
sensor housing because I don't want to
get any dust on it or anything I'm not
exactly working in a clean room but it
appears as though I have just freedom Oh
what the hell this is all one big thing
man the housing for the sensor here at
the front it's come free when I remove
the screw from the PCB here but it's
taking the heatsink with it do that but
the heatsink can't get out there's a
separate heat sink back there oh man why
are we doing this this is a really
stupid project oh you bastard what now
so there's a problem grommet that the
heat pipes pass through can you see that
there must be a thermal reason for doing
it maybe it's just a control airflow to
make sure that they don't lose any
leakage it all laps in tight oh man this
has a wrench freaking head on it all
wait you've got to be kidding me
it's tightening up pull the crap that's
turning the socket under it that's bad
as long as I can rotate this a little
bit I can access the one on the other
side oh my god where did this plug into
on the other end I don't remember we're
leaving two ends of this well you know
about this project already what huh you
didn't know that we're getting started
on it yet I don't oh yo is this the red
it's what remains of a red so this guy
goes on like this you can tell from the
blue on here and on here and how I
ripped it off and then this guy has it's
kind of like a GPU I think where there's
like a big chip and then some small
chips around it that I'll have thermal
goop on them so that's that can you kind
of envision it now picture them all
vertically align them yeah yeah okay so
there's another couple components here
the idea is basically just have like
this and I'd like to our Brad oh yeah
the bad comes outside so like where the
air cooling exhaust is we would just
like put a couple friggin holes in it
would we even have space for fittings
and the blocks no so we just have to
like solder to spray it on possibly but
remember these heat sinks go away yeah
true right so if we and then these
ribbons have a little bit of play so we
can make ourselves a little bit more
room between these without giving up
necessary space here because all these
heat sinks go away yeah like this one
this one not too hard I'm concerned
about this one yeah me too
and that also seems to be the one that
needs too much cool yes that's the one
with the heat pipes this was a really
bad idea
yeah but also like a good one how are
you going to mount on it here is it just
thermal paste it on oh my god no it
screwed in from the top look at these
gaps in the fins these are not an
accident it's not gonna work why not
give me one reason one out so you don't
have enough clearance
I might not quite working yeah I think
we need to get a super skinny driver
yeah that's gonna be a custom order part
ok so I've got these three screws off
now I hope it's far worse than I thought
there are no fewer than 10 elements that
need to be cooled on this one red
doesn't subscribe to the less-is-more
philosophy
y-l I have never seen anything like that
is that the chip as far as I can tell
but it has two screw holes through it
they make a quarter block but that
happens look why do you think I brought
you over here this is pointless project
so I guess what you're saying is don't
hold your breath for part two Oh coming
to you 2020
well no we can finish it yeah like we're
gonna be on it but like holy Shh
it's a victim not a patient
this thing is so full of a six like no
wonder the things so damn expensive I
wonder if someone from where at PGA well
what is this thing
oh hold on a second no it's not $5,000
hold on a second it's 28 nanometer
though like that's not yeah pretty like
bit tier stuff how much are they is hard
to say this is a tentative price $1600
for one and that's that's just this chip
not like anything else we are so I mean
if we just have to like cobble the thing
together and like kind of you know lean
on it to close it let's yeah like I
think that if it's water-cooled and then
zip tied together no one's going to
complain yes this is just where we say
goodbye and everyone hopes that we have
another ones in yeah and we also say
