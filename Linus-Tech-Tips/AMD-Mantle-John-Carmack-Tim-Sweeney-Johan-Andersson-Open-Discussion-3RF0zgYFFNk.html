Christopher luminaries learners
oh I mean I think uh my opinion on it is
I in terms of actions on this escalation
identity II have a response to mantle I
think that's unequivocal know they
should know it would be I think a
horrible mistake if summaries you know
how many think it got panicked by this
and made some lower level Indiana API
you already have very good low level
access through the GPU extensions and
avidians always work without headed
anywhere else give you as much
performance as you want to trade the
inconvenience of doom a convenient
proprietary stuff now mantle is ending
ad has talked many times the past about
close to the metal type of architectures
and he only ever became interesting
because of their dual console it was
just a way to do on the PC
well I couldn't have cared less
I the landscape does matter that they
have both the major consequence of the
similar architecture living entities
developers we will be making systems
architectural changes that go to those I
so I think it's not a stupid thing for a
you need to be doing it at this point
there are some benefits that they get
from it kinetic locations for steam
steam box type things there I but there
probably if Microsoft and Sony both
embrace it that will be very very
powerful for AMD but it doesn't look
like they're going to movies by yourself
I mean if I was still doing all of they
you know all the major technology coding
or next-gen game stuff I probably would
not be embracing the mantle right
but it would be there would be days
wouldn't extremely tap to interpret but
when I would dispassionately step back
and look at it I probably wouldn't
obviously others conclusions sure here's
some good ideas omit we really liked the
idea of having low level a little
overhead access to the GPU I mean if you
look back at what's in directx and
opengl there's a lot of overhead and
there's AP eyes and the multiple layers
of them and the fact that they date back
to in the old SGI Ottawa hardware
rendering which is very very different
than that a modern shader based
apartment and multiple that we have now
you know where you have potentially
unified memory and processing power
mobile and the GPU there are lots of
ways of sharing data that go beyond just
calling that one of the guys functions
for every little thing what I do so
they're good ideas there I hope that
really helps the OpenGL committee and
Microsoft shooter future immunize I mean
if you ask me what I much prefer to have
a low-level API I practice in the GPU
the answer is yes but five of them each
for different hardware architectures and
vendors and operating systems was
absolutely no that is the wrong
direction for the industry
- yet another API on the PC that's no
different than the standard PC DirectX
API and it's different in the OpenGL
doping GL es that it just on Mac and
Android iOS and it's different than the
PlayStation 3 PlayStation 4 is Lola
wondering API and it's different than
what Microsoft provides and Xbox and hey
I don't think it's a good idea so one of
the key things about it is and one of
the main reasons for doing is that it's
not the replacement this is not designed
that way and the idea is that we can
solve some of the long term models that
we've actually been having all the PCs
but from all the stuff we talked about
today performance of robust stable
performance that those are things we can
experiment and work but we do that bitty
CPU module deputy also of course this is
another Avenue you can see it's also
really interesting because essentially
opening up something that we're quite
familiar with already who is spending
the quality session last year work on
the next gen consoles and architectures
are saying we
those architectures and it's a good
video just as John described and I see
even though we're not done without work
with it and it's definitely not not done
yet theater to be able to be shipped out
I still see it as a success
even right now actually just because of
these conversations and the amount of
things that actually the not the
developments and the amount of so
they're both the solution and even the
opposite services and all the type of
them it's been a bit stale they say in
especially than PC graphics when it's
Microsoft a switch focus for quite some
time opportunity other things which they
probably really did mean to you but I
think now before is a really exciting
opportunity both on the on the piece of
space in the stuff for experimental
learning on the consoles but also mobile
as we discussed before okay what should
be prescribed medicine all these things
and this is just good to have lots of
different avenues to experiments and
actually improving deliver concrete
value it exists but it was John and Tim
that video would do there only do and
then individually with you an API that's
not
a future that would be very very a lot
of work at you yeah myself and from
those does play the part of optimism
momentum will be quite influential in
what we do by calls it specifically with
is just a start yeah you get used
together just it's bad for the market in
general stuff but when you say it's the
two questions what do you think is the
cost like the man years who implement a
mental support and feel again but he
think is he offered even you see that
could you try to quantify that it's in
this to we've been very busy just to
making sure our game works overall and
actually ship ship and shipping it out
or almost done with it
so it's too early the city will have a
lot more information in November talk
more about it and they're more
interesting to see I think it's
important also to what message that
people general people have about
developers can be difficult to
understand that because of all nights
it's actually it's not like people okay
we solve this one we're done go home and
gaming Roswell and ball makes it's like
whack-a-mole you fix one and then you
thought that that was the same you make
that four times faster and then
of course the biggest issue is that
really got architecture large-scale
vision to take maximum it's done no API
just also really makes a dramatic
develop some things because if you've
built a good game engine API even you
can magically made all that she doesn't
it's the possibility of you I mean
there's stuff one GC and I'm very
excited about some of the e synchronous
pipe like use for different things it
would be great to you know they take
direct direct control over a gradual
approach closer of shortly doing advance
before it's not like felt before is only
dedicated for a specific guys in there
while it work with something and deliver
concrete benefits and evaluate and then
go forward and see where we are and
opening in future all the sign games
based on many of the concepts that we're
proving out earlier now that we can
develop myself I think that's the
question it gets changed for the entire
industry even though people sometimes
people get stuck up on like the roles
they thinking again Oh
see the discussion that I've had before
okay it's move upward replace whole OPC
memory while actually is about this
invention in the industry overall and
you want that competitiveness not
necessary but having frightening
movement pitching these type of ideas
for many many years for every single
vendor and it's actually talking just
about my own egoistic view of solving my
own specific problem this is that we see
a lot of stalls we see a lot of
performance performance gone missing in
many areas that we want to learn how to
program main a machine on a lower level
I think that's something that will both
serve both outgoing portables so it's
good is an R&amp;amp;D platform for developers
it's here middle aged on your tongue but
the desire
find that they saw said that if it
pushes Microsoft OpenGL folks to encrypt
their drivers by realizing that hey you
can actually achieve a lot of reports on
PC what's the one of the level that
needs think it would totally be bad if
the outcome of this is that now we have
to do is find livers to States from a
great achievement effort and also the
division or for mental well you can play
up anyone's you don't any kind for the
same word for short and but the vision
prevent eliciting well it can become
it's just that's not the right way to go
out of addition there are no side views
already bits brothers that with these
few business shorty can make the DPI
that's completely down to the level sort
of what you like being on the PC we work
to who suburban that started I would
whisper that architecture what do you
think the way modern GPUs work is quite
different from from how the East or
absolutely to kill this I was beginning
to extensions and is revealed
Nexxus many things but there are some
analogies between all our products like
by these let's also say that it has been
working on it with video that it's
really the future for all tvs and if yes
the different members even the people
talking problem I mean it makes sense
that service remote in design the border
and you see some some convergence
towards things that are generally with
the Sun and then but it's a great fit
for or key hardware and this widget for
developers really get down to GPUs are
just peers on the same memory pool as
the CPU and you really need like
documented textured layouts and that's
nothing that everything is coming
associate so even the GPU is a
combination of tons of different
processors to significant the process
it's a viewer named a GPU there's quite
a lot of work in the pendant edges there
and that's something that's Hitler
promised how did you hear something that
you from the CPU in prepare your
commands to just give it to them it has
an arm that tries to figure out which
goes where that's just generally good
design things post
to do something picky like using the
hardware video decompression stop or
re-encoding there you have a better for
a new API to do things like compute or
salinity and give this well one of the
best abuse cases is for breakfast which
is kind of just a little bit weird but
but it's not like you want to use
opposed type to the pop-up window with
your graphics and you want to use it
completely separately than the CPU tries
for for loading the system and you want
to have background tests as well and I'm
really happy to see I'm not going back
from and just eat up whatever Victor
units that are feeling you need you
that's also generally good design
community GPU space I'm kidding about
these issues where I want GPU tasks
tangibly and we have no concept of
prioritization GVSU's where no we need
to deal with specified time slices in
priority of it it's about the CPU
schedule
more with us I think what you see first
corner first mover advantages for the
companies that the best party ever
something else something elder so
helpless closes so we for various
reasons is the Jesus software side of
things I am recite on that the card is
that going to be licensable - why are
you telling me that we have not
concluded the notion of it frankly you
know we're first trying to get it going
yeah it's awesome going at the display
yes order we had to change the chiku
architectures get it going it then
recruited any future it sounds like a
separate yeah yeah only that pesky TCA
Tim John yeah well we primarily is in
video
and I've got a light whose monitor on my
desktop some and you'll probably update
Americans yeah heard my voice fall down
we got the voice of God over here
telling us one more question</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
