4k well this sucks
I can barely even make out the
individual pixels I'm even gonna know
it's a video game are you tired of
having all that extra money in your
wallet
introducing the new r-tx 2060 the more
expensive version of the GTX 1160 we
accidentally leaked a few weeks ago now
you can play all your compatible games
at half the framerate by now awesome and
you know what else is awesome our
sponsor for this video glass wire with
glass wire you can instantly see your
current and past network activity detect
malware and block badly behaving apps on
your PC or Android device these offer
code line is to get 25% off below
all kidding aside we've been pretty
negative about product releases from
Nvidia lately and while it's good to get
our frustrations out every once in a
while it gets pretty boring if
everything is crap you know so for this
review I'm going to give the r-tx 2060
every chance I'd can for it to impress
me and I'm gonna try not to think too
much about my problems with the rest of
the r-tx launches and that should be
pretty easy on paper this thing actually
has a lot going for it compared to the
GTX 1060 it's got more CUDA cores and
way faster memory that is depending on
which version of the card you get more
on that later and that's to say nothing
of the inclusion of the USB type-c based
virtual link connector in fact the r-tx
2060 looks more like a beefed up gtx
1070 which is great because it's priced
that way too okay all right sorry I'm
letting a little bit of salt seep in
here but at 3:49 Nvidia's newest real
time ray tracing accelerator is a cool
handle more than its direct predecessor
60 tier card anywho like the gtx 1070 we
are down to one eighth pin PCI Express
power connector and while our founders
Edition is still rockin the new r-tx
style dual fan cooler design retreated
to a smaller lighter card overall that
on the surface looks a lot friendlier to
small form factors than its bigger
brothers in practice though this shorter
PCB design ends up being less helpful
than you'd think
thanks to the rear position of the PCI
Express power connector bummer
partner boards don't have to end up that
way though so all that really matters
about our founders Edition is how it
performs since launching - uproarious
applause r-tx ray-tracing and deep
learning super sampling anti aliasing
have been hot new features announced for
dozens of games so we should have plenty
to look at now that it's been on the
market for several months
rats that was more salt there wasn't it
but it's okay it's okay at least we have
something to look at now the shadow of
the Tomb Raider team's only birthday
present to me ended up being empty
promises but battlefield 5 and final
fantasy 15 respectively had support for
these features though a new card
supporting them doesn't tell us much
that we didn't already know our our fps
is roughly half for the privilege of
turning our TX on which in this case
unfortunately takes a GPU that is
capable of playable frame rates at 4k
medium settings and drops us to 1080p is
the difference between 1080p and 4k that
noticeable maybe not so much like you're
really in the heat of battle but as we
discussed in our recent video on
resolution vs. framerate the inability
to run at greater than 60 fps is going
to put you at a competitive disadvantage
in competitive games and that difference
in resolution is noticeable in
sightseeing titles as for DLS s it
performs pretty well but it's locked at
4k which means that this card translates
to a passable score in the final fantasy
15 benchmark it's not a great benchmark
but it does show us a pretty
representative performance difference
between TI a and d LS s now whether or
not you like the LS s anyway and the
shimmering that it retains on thin edges
versus ta a that's another story on to
more traditional gaming scenarios the RT
x 2060 runs significantly faster than
the gtx 1070 a pretty solid place to be
considering its similar specs and launch
price DirectX 12 in particular
exemplifies the improvements to
asynchronous compute that tearing brings
to the table and as a result we've got a
decent uplift pretty much across the
board and the RT x 2060s prospects
improve even further in our productivity
suite where it beats out the gtx 1070 by
a significant margin in lux mark and for
that matter
actually most workstation tasks budget
workstation use actually might be this
cards calling especially when you look
at its performance across
all but one test inspect you perf now
while we didn't run any deep learning
tests today armchair AI researchers
should directly benefit from the tensor
course and the fact that the GeForce
r-tx 2060 is the cheapest card that has
them it should come as no surprise
though but with all this tech packed
into it power consumption is up along
with thermal output showing us exactly
why the card still rocks the dense Finn
arrangement and dual fan cooler design
it's not terrible though because the
thing about power and thermals is that
you always have to look at it relatively
and AMD's closest performance competitor
Vega isn't even in the same ballpark
helping matters further partner cards
will probably have some interesting
board layouts and cooling solutions that
should make this a very versatile little
GPU with all of that in mind
who exactly is the r-tx 2064 well at
risk of sounding negative for the life
of me I can't think of a reason to use
its premiere feature you know the one
that's printed several times on the card
I mean even at medium settings it still
have z' your frame rate which is
unacceptable for a competitive shooter
like battlefield 5 especially if you use
a high refresh rate monitor and yes the
LSS is faster than taa but that assumes
that a six gig card can run future
supported games in 4k well enough to
even use the feature as for traditional
rendering well it's faster than a gtx
1070 at a similar launch price but then
you're paying $100 premium on a 60
series card
compared to the previous 60 series
anyway just for the privilege of that RT
X badge that you're not using
so the real conclusion here seems to be
the one that we haven't been given the
information to draw and that's that you
should buy the rumored upcoming r-tx
lists gtx 1160 that was leaked with
otherwise identical specs now
workstation performance seems really
promising at first
but the 1160 should come with the same
benefits there as well unless you're
into deep learning which leaves us today
then with a card that occupies a tidy
little decent gaming and also light
workstation you snitch until Nvidia
undermines its own product with a lower
priced alternative so buy it quickly
then to ensure that it's not irrelevant
by the time it arrives
oh but buy the right version because
rumor has it there's three different
memory configurations across three
different capacities so your mileage may
