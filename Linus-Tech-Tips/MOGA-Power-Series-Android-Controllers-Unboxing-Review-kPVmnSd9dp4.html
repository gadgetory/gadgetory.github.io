peripherals has the features you need to
win at a price you like click now to
learn more so gaming on smartphones we
all know this is stupid touchscreen
controls are terrible but honestly this
is like equally stupid because then now
how can you possibly control the d-pad
or the left analog stick or anything
like that so there is good news there is
a solution this my friends is the Moga
hero power and the Moga pro power which
we'll be taking a look at today we're
going to start with the hero power which
is a $60 model it has 2 clickable analog
sticks a d-pad ABXY buttons l1 r1 l2 and
r2 shoulder and trigger buttons an LED
battery life indicator that turns on
when you actually turn the device on as
well as a slim portable design excuse
the crotch shot here and a rechargeable
1,800 milliamp hour battery next up
we've got the pro power at $79.99 and
inside the box for that one we find what
they're calling a console style Comfort
game controller I think calling it
console style comfort is a little bit of
a stretch is it of the same build
quality as something like an Xbox 360
controller no but it is bigger than the
portable hero version so I will
definitely give them that it's got dual
clickable analog sticks a d-pad as well
as ABXY buttons l1 and r1 as well as l2
and r2 shoulder and trigger buttons and
led battery life indicator it's actually
quite glint granular glandular bren you
learned very handy it also has a
rechargeable 2200 milliamp hour battery
and ok I did claim this wasn't on boxing
so we should show you what's included
with them you get instructions a little
statement of whatever the heck as well
as a 6 inch USB to micro cable and a
more normal length USB to micro cable
and I'll show you what these are for in
a moment the other thing that the pro
includes that the hero does not include
is a little stand which you can actually
put a tablet or a smartphone on so that
you don't have to clip it to the
controller more on that in a moment so
the killer app here for the power series
is that the included batteries not only
power the device itself but also the
phone that it's connected to so there is
a boost port at the back that you use
that little six-inch cable for you go
ahead and plug that in and then you can
plug that directly into your phone so it
can actually augment the battery life of
your phone because we all know that
phones have terrible battery life when
you are gaming it can reach pretty much
anywhere on the device so you can see I
can actually position this all the way
around to the top of an experience e1
and how does it do that you might ask
well it all starts with the smart lock
system it's spelled SMRT so Homer
Simpson clearly thinks it's a good idea
and Who am I to disagree with him how
well does it work exactly well we did
some shake tests with a variety of
phones that we that we borrowed so these
are ones that have to go back to the
manufacturer so what do we care if they
come out and it actually did incredibly
well the rubber grippy material on the
top and the bottom is some of the best
that I have ever encountered this is a
fantastic feature but it isn't quite
perfect there aren't really any angle
options so both on the hero as well as
on the pro you can see that you've only
got completely sort of down completely
right angle and then this particular
angle right here which I actually didn't
find was quite perfect from like a
sitting gaming standpoint because I
don't hold my controller flat it looks
like whoever designed it was expecting
you to sit with your controller flat on
a desk as opposed to angled up in a more
natural position it wasn't a
deal-breaker especially if your phone
has a decent viewing angle but it just
wasn't quite as comfortable as it could
have been maybe on the next generation
so before we get into the million dollar
question of how does it play exactly
I'll give some context for the
competition the stuff that I've tried so
I've used the Nyko play pad Pro that's
the only sort of lower-cost Bluetooth
controller optimized for phones that I
have it's very low latency so that's
great but the ergonomics are just
frankly not very good it's somewhere
between the hero power and the pro power
as far as the gaming experience goes but
it's bulky like the pro power as opposed
to being something that's mobility
optimized like the hero power the other
option that I'll talk about is Nvidia
shield so this is heavy I mean when you
compare it to even the pro power which
is the heavier of
two options loaded up with an experience
which is a pretty heavy phone that comes
in at around four hundred and thirty
grams shield is around five hundred and
ninety grams with that said it has heavy
hitting battery life as well as heavy
hitting features you can it has a Tegra
4 processor you can play Android games
you can stream PC games and all that
stuff but it is in a completely
different price bracket because this
works with your existing phone and costs
anywhere from sixty to eighty bucks
depending on the model you're looking at
in this class anywhere from two hundred
to three hundred dollars and depending
if you buy it with a graphics card or
not finally game compatibility Moga does
have optimized compatible games that
work out of the box and I did find that
that worked quite well and was very
seamless and with the a/b switch on the
bottom you can also flip it into hid
mode so any games that are compatible
with HIV which stands for human
interface device by the way for you guys
who don't know that any games that
support that will work perfectly shield
of course is compatible with those kinds
of things as well but also has
touchscreen mapping which is an
available download from Nvidia that
allows you to take touchscreen controls
and actually bind them to buttons on the
controller this is something where I
feel like these third-party guys have a
little bit of room to catch up because
it's an incredibly cool feature so for
the gaming experience in general
thoughts I'm going to separate them I'll
do the pro first the button tactile feel
and organ aam --ax are quite good
actually they're ok it's not an Xbox 360
controller we've been very clear about
that but they're quite good the
joysticks are good the click enos of the
joysticks is good the d-pad is very
mediocre I'd say on the low end of
mediocre even considering how much D
pads have been a bend and this isn't
something I want to play my older
emulated games on from SNES or anything
like that precision platforming not so
much but the ABXY buttons are not bad
they're maybe a little bit hard to press
but I'm not going to take off too many
marks there the shoulder buttons and
trigger buttons are very good the only
thing that really bothered me about the
ergonomics of this one is the fact that
you bumped the right joystick when
pressing the a button and the X button
if you're not extremely careful if you
have larger hands than me it will be
more of an issue the setup app is
excellent this actually goes for both of
them you just install their Moga app on
the phone and then it guides you through
the entire process it's very very simple
you don't even need the instructions of
the hid setup as well as the Moga
my setups the latency was solid Reapers
a game that I've been playing a lot of
actually lately and it's a little bit of
precision is required but it's not a
huge deal and I didn't notice any delay
whatsoever
and apparently multiplayer gaming is
also a feature so you can use two of
these out of time which is cool but we
didn't happen to try that particular one
now the pro comes with this little stand
which actually holds anywhere up to you
know like a 10-inch quite heavy bulky
tablet and folds up small enough that
even though the controller itself
doesn't fit in your pocket this stand
could easily fit in your pocket sorry
for that crotch shot again and you could
take it with you anywhere you wanted so
it's going to come down to whether you
prefer the ergonomics of the larger
controller or the convenience of a
smaller one so for the hero obviously
the ergonomic experience is not as good
this is something that I'd consider to
be a little bit better for something
like emulated games the d-pad is
actually better than the pro in my
estimation although the joysticks are
not as good and the click enos of the
joysticks is a little bit hard to
activate the ABXY buttons are about the
same I'd say maybe even a little bit
better they're a little bit of a lighter
touch compared to the pro and the
shoulder buttons are actually quite nice
feeling the one where this really falls
on its butt is the triggers the triggers
are the worst triggers I've ever
encountered on a controller I mean here
I'm going to put this next to my mic
there's there's no tactile response
they're extremely mushy and extremely
slow to respond but I'm willing to let
that slide because the portability and
the fact that not only this one but both
of these controllers give you extended
play time by charging your phone at the
same time is a very excellent feature I
did find myself frustrated by the lack
of an adjustable angle for the smart
hinge here but I understand why they did
what they did particularly for the pro
even with a heavy phone installed in it
you can put it down and it doesn't tip
over which is quite nice whereas for the
hero you know if they find anything
further back anything would just tip the
thing over but I think the idea is
you're supposed to be holding it when
you're using it anyway
