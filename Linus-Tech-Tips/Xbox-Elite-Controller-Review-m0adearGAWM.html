it elite well has a ton of pretty wicked
features and almost as much modularity
as your buddies 1990 Civic hatchback but
unfortunately costs almost the same as
well
what are those features how does it feel
how does it perform let's find out
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check the link in the video description
to learn more the truly badass features
start with the magnetized
interchangeable thumb sticks the default
one is the Xbox one esque concave thumb
stick and then you have a more
PlayStation style domed top or last but
not least you have the tall concave
thumb sticks which are great for
precision but do feel a bit weird being
so tall and make pressing other buttons
a little bit more difficult but if
that's your thing go for gold following
that we have the swappable d-pad the
default one is this kind of satellite
dish style thing which I personally felt
was kind of weird in many situations I
found myself miss clicking on it fairly
often and if also playing a game where I
had to quickly slam a direction on the
d-pad it does have the ability to lift
off due to the magnetic nature of its
mount but that's not to say it doesn't
have its rightly place this is hands
down the best d-pad I've personally ever
used if I was looking to play a fighting
game not only is it lightning fast to
use but doing moves where you have to
roll your thumb around the d-pad becomes
a breeze and hey if you don't like it
the other d-pad is super standard and to
be honest I even kind of liked using the
d-pad raw without any of the magnetized
features on top of it which actually
worked surprisingly well the last
feature in the modular category are the
paddles on the back of the controller
they can help improve your gameplay in
almost any game that would benefit from
you being able to press buttons while
both your thumbs are on the thumbsticks
which is almost every game that I know
of but they can also be kind of annoying
because kind of where you grip your
controller and that can cause accidental
inputs which are frustrating as hell but
it's cool just take some of them or all
of them off it's super easy to do just
rotate them out of their little magnetic
sockets my favorite configuration is
with the small paddles in the upper
positions and no paddles in the bottom
positions this allows my pinky and ring
finger to just grip the controller while
my middle finger pointer finger and
thumb do all the actual input work the
triggers however are undeniably
very better they come with trigger stops
switches on the back of the controller
which are awesome personally if I'm not
playing a racing game I find the long
travel time and soft ending of the
normal Xbox one controller trigger pole
to be very unsatisfactory engaging the
trigger stops will result in a shorter
travel distance and sharper stops which
feels way better in anything that is in
a racing game to be honest the inclusion
of trigger stops alone if it was a
unique feature would have sold me on
this controller let's take a little
break with the hardware to cover some
software which is available through the
Xbox Store on both your PC and Xbox
under the name Xbox accessories
fair warning gonna get a little bit
angry here but first off the good stuff
you can change a ton of things like
mapping any button to any other button
which is pretty damn cool and I'm sure
very helpful for disabled gamers or just
those who love customization you can
change the brightness of an LED or even
the sensitivity of either of the
thumbsticks or triggers you might be
wondering how this possibly made me
angry well Microsoft apparently decided
that the PC version of this app just
didn't need graphs labeled why I don't
know the causal version has the labels
my guess is that it was probably a
complete afterthought yep you click on
the hardware settings button then on to
left stick right stick or triggers and
bam a bunch of random slide II bars that
change some random stuff or buttons that
add dotted lines to your graph I mean I
know they're for sensitivity but I'm
reviewing the product I knew these were
going to be in the menus before I even
open up the software also an
afterthought was that the default
pre-done configs were for console games
yet still shown on the pc version does
this mean we're eventually going to get
more of them than just Gears of War
hopefully but I doubt it I'm tired of
the PC afterthought this may not seem
like a big deal but it feels more like
another minor slap in the face and a
tease from Microsoft I mean come on guys
you showed these games off on pcs that
shows anyways just give them to us and
at least give us software that has some
freaking labels on it okay
rant over back to hardware yes there is
also the included 3.5 millimeter
Jack but that's not actually a uniquely
elite controller feature and before you
go run and check your current ex bone
controller this is a relatively new
thing but it is included in their newer
standard controllers as well to cap
things off with the fairly obvious yes
this is a wireless controller as you've
probably seen by now it does come with
two double-a Duracell batteries in the
box so it is ready to rock right away
and if you're a PC person no it won't
automatically connect to your computer
you do need the Microsoft Windows 10
xbox controller dongle which is about 25
US dollars or if you want to bypass all
of that because honestly screw batteries
they included a pretty nicely braided
standard length nine foot micro USB
cable which in my opinion could actually
be a little bit longer because I know a
few buddies that have setups that have
the coach further the nine feet away
from their home theater but there are
always USB extensions now I'm seeing
loads of early reviews harking about how
this thing is so expensive and they're
correct I'm not saying it's cheap of
course not but let's not ignore the fact
that scuff exists a ton of the features
on this controller we're already
available in some way shape or form
whether you think it's better or worse
that's up to you on a scuf controller
and this is how gamers have been getting
these features for a long time so yes in
conclusion it costs a load but it's a
relatively similar price to a medium kit
scuf controller and I don't find that
the least bit surprising what I also
don't find surprising is that it has
already sold out practically everywhere
people love their peripherals I mean
look at mechanical keyboards I've
definitely purchased a few overpriced
versions of those so pick your poison if
it's too much for you move on if you're
looking for a premium controller this
might be one to pay attention to get
razors and other bathroom supplies like
dr. Carver's shave butter and one wipe
Charlies shipped directly to your door
for only a few bucks a month with Dollar
Shave Club
there are even high-quality razors going
all the way up to their six blade
executive model that doesn't bother with
the frilly crap like vibrating handles
rotating heads because honestly who
needs that so if you're lazy like me and
also want to have a good experienced
head over to dollarshaveclub.com slash
Linus and sign up to have all of that
stuff delivered to your door in the US

review on the sabre-tooth xbox 360
