and I call this my new camera because
not because other people won't be
allowed to use it but because they don't
want to I'm the only one who works here
who actually cares that we just got
ourselves a Canon X a 20 so the X 820 is
the upgrade from the XA 10 the the old
formerly only camera that we really had
that was better than like a pocket
point-and-shoot so it comes with a
massive user manual which I think most
people probably won't look at as well as
a data import utility but quite frankly
if you're using like canons included you
know zoom browser equivalent or whatever
it is that they have these days you
should probably just go find a new line
of work so let's just put all that aside
and have a look at all the goodies that
are included inside the box of the X 820
so in front of us we have the fairly
large accessory package that comes with
the XA 21st is a full 4-pole adapter to
composite video out as well as left and
right audio next we've got an AC power
cable that goes with the DC brick right
there that we can use to power the
camera for longer shoots in the studio
for example this is an interesting
inclusion so they now include an HDMI to
mini HDMI cable which is great because
it has a mini HDMI output I really wish
they would have upgraded that to full
HDMI it includes one of their new even
more intelligent batteries and I'm gonna
take a moment to kind of rant about this
because you can't use x8n compatible
batteries with the XA 20 Canon has
basically implemented a system whereby
if you install an older battery into the
new merc amaura it'll say oh sorry it
powers on right and shows you an image
oh sorry this battery is not compatible
disc Emily and it just turns off Canon
dick move
you guys dick move because being able to
reuse your older batteries and upgrade
your equipment is a very good thing and
it could have just said hey look the the
the level readings aren't going to be
accurate with this older type of battery
but instead you just had it turn off so
currently there aren't any cheap
third-party alternatives to the Canon
batteries which are like a hundred bucks
for
extended battery so once again dick move
cannon they've got one of those magnetic
sort of or iron or whatever they are
anyway the theory is they reduce
interference on cables in practice I
suspect your USB cable doesn't care if
you install one of those they've also
got a USB a two mini B cable for pulling
data directly off the camera but that's
not your only option more on that in a
moment a lens hood which is really cool
because it's got this little flip out
doodad right here that allows you to
instead of installing a lens cap just
have a flip of the switch protected or
ready to rock sort of functionality
which i think is fantastic they include
a shotgun mic shock mount however it's
really nothing special that's very hard
rubber as well as a couple of screws to
install it and finally a remote that
allows you to well remotely control the
camera but that's not your only option
for that either
so okay things you have more than one
option for data transfer all of a sudden
boom the XA twenty has Wi-Fi and start
pulling the camera Canon also almost got
great points for environmentally
friendly packaging but they did include
a little bit of plastic so it has Wi-Fi
now which supports data transfer even to
an FTP which is incredibly cool so being
able to just kind of go look here's my
FTP login credentials automatically
throw my footage on there absolutely
huge thumbs up you can also use Wi-Fi to
control the camera using a smartphone
which is very cool as well so you can
adjust your focus or start and stop
recording using a supported phone it
just says supported phones on their apps
but I'm gonna go ahead and try a couple
of different devices with it over the
next little while here so that's in
addition to the remote not only that but
it has a landsea connector so you can
also use that to control it using
supported using supported accessories as
well I haven't actually found it yet but
you can see I pulled out the body of the
camera as well as the handle so we're
gonna take a much closer look at them
once I go ahead and show you guys so
that just slides into the shoe mount
right there the two built in screws at
the back go here and I really don't
recommend using the XA twenty without
the handle because it includes not only
a handle for holding on to the camera
but also some pretty important
functionality so right here it's got
your control for your microphones so you
can either have Fanta
power or not have phantom power you can
switch the two different inputs on or
off just like that and then you can also
switch to recording using the built-in
stereo microphones here and here but I
mean they're okay they're not great but
they're okay and the next you have
analog controls for the levels on those
two XLR inputs that are on the other
side over here last but not least you
get I yes okay so you get a pass through
for that shoe mount as well as start and
stop you can lock this off if you don't
want to accidentally press it as well as
zoom control so it really is a great
little accessory it comes with the
camera you should pretty much always
have it on there so now we've got the
camera geared up it's time to take a
quick tour of it so first things first
this is what this looks like installed
on the camera it quite effectively
blocks out the light completely from
being a transmitted it's kind of a one
or the other with the hood and the lens
cap because you can actually see right
here even if I wanted to put the lens
cap in I wouldn't be able to so I
wouldn't imagine myself using the lens
cap ever again which means I'll probably
lose it so here just guys remind me if I
ever ask where it is I put it in the box
for the X a 20 so that I wouldn't lose
it all right so let's go ahead and have
a look at controls to start with so the
menu is much much better than last time
around and the main reason for that is a
couple small tweaks in layout for where
you can where you can change settings
and the biggest one is that it now
features a capacitive touch screen
instead of a pressure-sensitive touch
screen so that makes scrolling through
menus much much easier compared to the
previous gen product you don't feel like
you're like mashing on the screen in
order to select anything or change a
setting it's also just you know smoother
to scroll through so that's that's more
natural they've also moved around quite
a few of the adjustments that you can
make such as switching between auto
focus and manual focus and part of the
reason for this is that they've changed
that the way the that the way you switch
between manual mode and automatic mode
so it used to be on the old camera the
x8n the power button when you when you
turned it on you actually had to decide
am I in auto mode or manual mode that's
not the case anymore
so now you've got off camera mode and me
a mode which makes sense is like how
every other camera in the world works
the x8n had a button here for playback
and review which is random I don't think
I've ever seen anything like that before
now there's just a switch for auto mode
manual mode and cinema mode so cinema
mode we're not going to spend too much
time on because basically all it does is
give you sort of some filters that you
can put over top of your footage which I
mean might help a little bit in
post-processing so filter one right here
is a cinema standard so it's just a bit
of a flatter profile so you can play
around with color a little bit more in
post vivid you can actually see previews
of these over to the right here so we'll
point it sometimes you can see vivid is
much more vivid dream just puts kind of
a goofy-looking vignette around things
and then there's a bunch of other
filters that you can you can set up the
next thing is layout of the buttons
makes things a little bit easier for you
as well so the buttons are now user
configurable they have five programmable
buttons too over here to the left of the
LCD one on the inside right here that's
button number five and then two more
back here at the back of the camera so
the fact that you can reconfigure those
to whatever you want is a huge huge
upside to this camera compared to the
last gen product back are the dual SD
card slot so these support SDXC a and B
and they support a couple of cool modes
actually a few cool modes so with the
new digit for video processor that's
inside here you can not only do what you
can do on the previous product which was
you could record simultaneously to both
cards so that you have an automatic
backup or you could record to one and
then the other and you can actually swap
them out in the middle so you could
record continuously that's all supported
now you can actually record in two
different bit rates at the same time so
you can have low bitrate working files
or web-ready files and then you can have
full bitrate ones one on one card and
one on the other card which is a very
very cool feature it does have an
infrared mode just like the old camera
did moving further around to the back
we've got a little toggle switch here
that actually allows you to change the
functionality of your focus wheel
between focus and zoom whatever you
prefer so if we go around to the front
of the camera that basically allows you
to kind of go okay I want this to be
focused I want this to be zoom in the
menu you can configure which way is
which for both of them and then there's
also
ha this right here is a dedicated button
for gain now you used to be able to
control that with the LCD screen but you
had to choose between gain and something
else can't remember what it was anymore
it's been a long time since I've used
the x8n extensively but now you have a
dedicated wheel for that so if you kind
of go ok my focus ring is focus and it's
a it's an infinite focus ring guys so
you don't you're not gonna have like
that muscle memory ability to focus
which is really unfortunate I wish they
had just made it linear anyway so you've
got your focus ring for focus you can
adjust gain on the fly right here and
then you can use the zoom rocker for
zoom which actually has a variety of
different speeds that it can operate at
you can either have it be linear and you
can select up to 16 different speeds or
you can press it harder for more and
press it softer for Less whichever you
prefer this gives you a much greater
degree of flexibility while you're a
run-and-gun shooting
compared to the previous camera so why
did we go with this versus something
like a DSLR or a Blackmagic pocket
Cinema Camera or something along those
lines there's a couple of reasons so
that run-and-gun
aspect of it it makes it ideal for
things like you know event coverage
where you're not carrying around some
bulky thing or external adapters you
just get one file at the end of it which
might not be as flexible as what you
might get out of a DSLR might not have
that same cinematic look and shallow
depth of field like a DSLR it might not
have the same codec support of something
like a Blackmagic pocket Cinema but what
it is is it's an all-in-one the footage
is ready to do something with it whether
it's upload directly to YouTube
automatically wirelessly upload to your
FTP or whatever else the case may be the
sensor is slightly bigger than the older
x8n so it's a one over two point eight
four inch and it's a CMOS sensor so the
older one was a 1/3 inch CMOS sensor so
it's slightly bigger and I think that
that's pretty much all the justification
I mean it's got other kind of cool stuff
it has a pre record buffer which is
really neat which means that when you
have it configured whenever you're
rolling it's actually capturing the last
three seconds of footage which means
that if you're kind of like you know
you're at little Johnny's thing and no
holy crap they started the race a little
bit early boom you press that button and
you're actually going to get that
previous three seconds so you're not
going to miss any
thing continuous autofocus is really
nice they've actually got a few
different modes for it so number one is
you can do like a facial detection
continuous autofocus you can have medium
speed autofocus which will look more
natural or you can just have instant
auto focus which is something that you
would have to do manually on a DSLR
although it's great to have that manual
control but again it comes down to
different strokes for different folks
this lens right here has a 35 millimeter
equivalent zoom range that goes from
26.8 millimeters all the way up to 576
millimeters and the optical image
stabilization coupled with some of the
fancy image stabilization that canons
doing with the digit 4 processor
actually looks pretty amazing so check
this out we're gonna go ahead we're
actually gonna zoom in 20 times on my
sweater over there so I'm holding this
like way out from my body you can see a
little bit of noise in the image just
because that's a very very low light but
there's actually surprisingly not a ton
of shake you can see what an awkward
position I'm in right there and the fact
that I can hold it that steady zoomed in
that close is very very impressive
there's a viewfinder electronic
viewfinder right there that you pop out
in order to enable it there's the
start/stop record button here so that's
in addition to the one on the handle
there's aa ha this is great so there's a
little rocker here that gives you a push
button support as well as directionality
that you can use to navigate the menu if
you prefer that to a touchscreen which
some people do as well as another button
that's for navigating the menu over here
over on the right they have dramatically
improved things here so power in goes up
here which I actually don't think is
better than the old one which had power
in at the bottom and then there's also
your a/v out but mostly you're not gonna
need that for anything and look at this
this little this little thing nothing
here the old camera had like the micro
or the mini HDMI out down there so you
actually couldn't handhold it and have
HDMI out at the same time which was
ridiculous so what am I gonna be using
it for I'm gonna be using it for things
like vlogging if you guys saw any of our
GPU 14 coverage where it was basically
just like Mehan camming things running
around that was all shot with the x8n
the older camera it was a bit of a test
case for it are people gonna enjoy this
content at all how easy is it going to
be for me to create
I have like a small compact camera how
good is it gonna look so that's one of
the reasons we invested in one of these
behind the scenes up until now I've shot
all of my behind-the-scenes footage on
my HTC one and while people have
commented that it looks not bad
particularly the sound is really really
terrible you know whenever it's windy or
anything like that so I'm having a
camera that actually has you know a
reasonable quality shotgun mic on it in
a shock mount with a windsock is going
to dramatically improve the audio
quality of behind-the-scenes footage and
because it's nice and compact it's the
kind of thing that we can actually carry
around and and like quickly shoot things
with much like you would be able to do
with a phone it's for things like casual
videos where the cinematography of it
isn't really important so if we were
doing like you know oh hey
crap we just found this like cool
setting in this benchmark and we wanted
to just do like a short little video
about it we grabbed this throw it in
full auto mode shoot a quick thing and
upload it to the channel obviously the
quality of the footage is not going to
be as good as what we can get out of the
fs700 which is what this is being shot
on but I would like to at least give you
guys a little demo of what you can
expect out of it and that will run here
at the end of the video so guys if you
liked this video give it a like if you
disliked it give it a dislike if you
have feelings that are more complicated
than that or you really don't understand
why I you know wasted my money on this
camera or you really think it was a
great idea and you can't believe we ever
bought anything else please do leave a
comment under the video and if you want
to discuss it further guys there's
always a link to the Linus tech tips
forum below the video as well as a link
for where you can buy one of these
suckas if you wanted to do so and as
