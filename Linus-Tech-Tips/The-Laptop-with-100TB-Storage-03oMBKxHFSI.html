here in Final Cut or at least pretending
to I'm gonna go ahead and rip out one of
our drives have you ever walked into a
coffee shop in the middle of the day and
been shocked to see how many people
appear to be using it as their office
well that's because there are a ton of
freelancers out there who do everything
from pitching clients to writing scripts
to editing video often all on one
portable machine but sometimes
especially if you're editing video or
even photos you need more storage space
than a MacBook Pro or any laptop for
that matter can offer that's where this
puppy comes in
so we've configured our test device here
with over 100 terabytes of rapid access
storage actually 120 terabytes to be
precise and only a single Thunderbolt 3
cable is required to connect it to our
laptop oh and did I mention that it
charges to we're gonna show you guys how
to do it speaking of showing you guys
we're gonna show you guys how to check
out our sponsor glass wire if you don't
know what's going in and out of your PC
or Android device when you're connected
to the Internet you can use glass wire
to see if there are any badly behaving
apps
use offer code linus to get 25 percent
off at the link below
so when we first set out to build our
100 terabyte laptop the first thing we
needed was a PC or Mac with Thunderbolt
3 Thunderbolt 3 gives us both the
performance and the ease-of-use that we
need to make this a legitimately viable
solution instead of just a weird tech
demo the second thing we needed was a
gas nowadays is not to be confused with
a mass which is short for network
attached storage those things are great
we use them all the time here at our
office they can be accessed remotely and
they can be used by multiple computers
so they're for multiple users
simultaneously the problem though is
that they are slower especially in terms
of access latency so our gas or direct
attached storage device is an arica arc
80 50 T 3-12 now there are four six and
eight dry variants that are also
available but we chose this one because
we wanted a really flashy headline like
100 terabytes the other main feature
that we wanted was of course Thunderbolt
3 so it comes with the included
Thunderbolt cable that you see right
here which gives us 40 gigabit per
second peak transfer speeds between our
devices and the ability to daisy chain
using the second Thunderbolt 3 port keep
in mind though that we wouldn't use this
capability to add more storage boxes on
top of the one we have instead we'd rely
on this right here this is an SF 86 44
port and it's a lot cooler than it
sounds because it lets us take just kind
of a dummy secondary enclosure and link
our original one to it and use the
controller that's in here as well as the
Thunderbolt 3 chip here to allow this
one to manage the whole thing as one big
array so inside our arica enclosure is
an LSI hardware RAID processor also
called a raid on chip or rock so it's
higher performance compared to software
raid in many cases but could be harder
to recover data from as
paired to software aid in the event of
an error and that was actually something
that we did experience with hardware
RAID in the past inside here is also two
gigs of ECC RAM which causes about a two
percent performance in but allows us to
detect and correct data that was
improperly read or written now let's
talk about our drives so this unit is
actually sold diskless but B&amp;amp;H who
generously provided our unit for this
video offers preloaded systems if you
for whatever reason have trouble finding
the nas optimize drives that are out
there and installing them which you
shouldn't because it's a pretty simple
process so you basically take your four
screws screw them into the bottom of
these rails and then there's a backplane
in the back of the unit that you slide
it into and lock your drive in place but
there are ways to make mistakes like
they do have mounting holes for two and
a half inch drives but I wouldn't
recommend using those in a unit like
this because you'll be compromising your
capacity and your performance anyway we
actually prefer the empty version
because this is cool you don't need to
fill all of the bays right off the bat
on many dass's if you were to add more
drives later it would mean that you
would need to reformat and recreate your
raid and that's pretty inconvenient
because the whole point of having a
device like this is this is like your
storage locker for all your stuff where
are you going to put it all while you
reformat it ours on the other hand has
what's called online volume expansion so
that additional capacity can be used to
enlarge the last volume set or create
another volume set now as for mixing and
matching drives that's something that
you run into when you add some drives
now and you upgrade later some people
actually encourage using different makes
and models of disks as long as they keep
the same spindle rpm so that's to say
how fast the disk actually spins within
the drive and the same claimed capacity
so the arguments for this are that it
reduces the risk of systemic failure so
that's to say like a flaw that affects
all particular units of of this drive
for example another thing that's nice
about adding drives over time is
they won't all be the same age if you
look at the way that hard drives fail
over time it tends to be a lot of them
then very few then it ramps up
significantly as they get older so if
they're all the same age
you can imagine that they would all
start to drop off at around the same
time with all of that said if you've got
known good drives there is a performance
advantage to using ones that are all the
same if you're striping data across them
which we are doing because we're looking
for not just massive capacity but also
high performance for our project we went
with C gates 12 terabyte iron wolf pros
they have a great balance of price and
performance and they deliver the
capacity that we need in order to hit
our goal now we could have gone with
something more expensive like a SAS
Drive our dance actually does support
that but for this kind of a deployment
there's not going to be a performance
benefit so we're gonna stick with these
sort of prosumer grade devices instead
the last thing we need is power now this
is just a standard power cord but I
would strongly recommend for a device
like this either getting the sold
separately battery backup or connecting
it to a UPS so that it doesn't suddenly
lose power in the event of a power
outage so that's that's it now we are
ready to go through the setup process to
set up your machine download the
Installer from the arica website and
follow the steps after restarting launch
the storage manager to configure your
raid now there are a ton of different
options in here but we're going to
choose quick create and raid 5 plus
spare this is going to stripe our data
across 11 of our drives including one
parity Drive and it will leave one spare
drive available just in case one of our
other 11 decides to kick the bucket this
way it will rebuild automatically in the
event of a drive failure now you'll have
to wait some number of hours for your
array to initialize it ended up taking
about 10 hours in our case so now that
everything is completely set up and
ready to go
you can see we're running off of battery
here but we take our single Thunderbolt
3 cable
plug it into our system our array fires
up we are charging our MacBook and
theoretically we're gonna see our
external storage volume pop up right
around here so one of the few disk speed
tests for Mac is actually the black
magic disk speed test which is intended
to find out how fast a particular volume
is in the context of what kind of
footage it can handle so I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm going to select our target
Drive let's go ahead and see a Wow look
at it go
not too shabby just shy of two gigabytes
per second on both reads and writes
which results in a completely green lit
up black magic disk speed test we can
handle everything up to 4k 60fps content
at 10 bit 4 to 2 but that's not actually
much of a surprise to us because 2
gigabytes per second is well in excess
of even the data rates of our 8k cameras
so you would be able to handle any kind
of footage under the Sun using a
connection like this to an array like
that for our next trick we're gonna take
a look at Final Cut Pro X now I am far
from an expert on the use of this
software so we brought in one of our
editors to give me your honest
impressions any thoughts on the
performance of this timeline
it's a multicam clip so is that
demanding typically usually yeah feels
good feels responsive more or less yeah
any complaints whatsoever can you find
any problem I want to know about the
problems I mean to be clear I'm not
actually expecting you to find a problem
oh yeah yeah we're editing off of this
and it's like 2 gigabytes a second read
and write so we are expecting it to
perform well I was just hoping maybe you
can find some some flaw in the machine
no looks good very snappy yeah cool no
so overall this is not a cheap solution
but we're really happy with the
experience it charges our laptop it
gives us blazing fast performance and of
course like any heart
we're a raid enclosure it gives us some
fault tolerance so you can see James is
editing away here in final cut or at
least pretending to I'm gonna go ahead
and rip out one of our drives it's gonna
freak the heck out but we're still
editing baby pretty cool right anyway it
gets even better go ahead and close down
final tech and can you drag that drag to
the garbage there when it's time to go
out and hit the road that's all there is
to it see ya there's no door here and
