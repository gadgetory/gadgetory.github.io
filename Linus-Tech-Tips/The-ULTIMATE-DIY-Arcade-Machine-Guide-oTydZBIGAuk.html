source of joy in this world than a
personal computer but every day
elderly devices like this one find
themselves without a home discarded
abandoned forgotten so I'm here today to
ask you not for a donation but just for
a moment of your time to listen as we
show you a path to a future where you
and your slightly obsolete gaming PC can
pone together once more this is your
chance to say I won't sit by while the
computer suffers
Ek water blocks is all aluminum fluid
gaming lineup offers great water cooling
performance for an affordable price
learn more at the link in the video
description so when Tarun first came to
me in proposed building a custom arcade
box I immediately demanded he get back
to work and stop wasting company time a
short while later coincidentally I
independently came up with a brilliant
idea why don't we build our own custom
arcade box so first then we set out to
construct the computer that we would
build the arcade box around this is line
of tech tips so we could have easily
strapped SLI Titans and an 8k monitor to
a piece of plywood and called it a day
but the hardware demands of emulating
ancient software are actually very light
and besides silly intro bit aside we
wanted the focus of this video to be on
showing how you can get a little more
mileage out of your components that are
nearing the end of their useful life so
it was important to us that every part
of our computer was something that would
be coming up on replacement age and
readily available secondhand in the end
for a really reasonable price we were
able to put together what would have
been a respectable mid-range gaming PC
circa 2011 with just one unusual
requirement we wanted a video card with
an s-video output because we are totally
going to rock a CRT in our finished
build for authenticity once all of the
hardware was in place we were ready to
set up our front end the program that
wraps everything together in order to
use MAME the go-to but notoriously
command line only arcade emulator that's
been around since the mid 90s the front
end allows us to peruse our vast
collection of legally obtained software
and then run it in the emulator our
first pick was retroarch a front end
that handles a number of different
emulators and hasn't infamously innovate
menu design while it took a little
internet archeology to assemble all the
files we needed we were actually able to
get it up and running just not quite to
our satisfaction without endless
tinkering it messed with mains control
layouts too much to try to conform them
to its own and a lot of our legally
obtained software couldn't be detected
so we had a conundrum on our hands we
wanted to stick with open source
software but most of the purpose-built
arcade front ends that met our standards
well their proprietary so we dug deeper
into the depths of the internet and
discovered a relatively new front end
called attract mode with a healthy
community making skins and plugins
attract mode gave us the perfect storm
of form and function even supports
scripting which will be important later
on in our project well that's all fine
and good but at this point all you got
Linus is a geriatric PC running
emulation software that's a far cry from
the full-on arcade experience that I was
expecting I mean look at this thing so
yeah you're right we needed joysticks
buttons light guns and a big beautiful
monitor to show it off on so I tasked my
staff with scouring craigslist and ebay
for some previously loved accessories
that we could dust off and put to use
again we were able to find multiple
sources for everything we needed this
was actually the smoothest experience
we've ever had buying guns off
Craigslist when it came to buttons and
joysticks though we found the secondary
market to be basically non-existent you
can order one of the pre-built arcade
decks that are out there but we really
wanted to customize our own so we did
after some research we reached out to
Andy over at Ulta mark in the UK which
is one of the better known arcade parts
suppliers for enthusiasts and after a
couple minutes of browsing their website
found exactly what we wanted RGB
yes so we asked for 30 of their classic
RGB buttons with seven ultra luxe chrome
buttons for special functions and to hit
yep
that's right they even have RGB 6 - so
the 2 servo 6 we went with have
interchangeable handles and with some
clever software they can automatically
change from 8 way to 4 way which is
great when you're switching between your
completely legitimate copy of pac mr. to
something like street conflict but what
about games that use analog controls ah
well that's where the ultra stick 360
comes in it uses a Hall effect sensor in
order to determine where the sickand
making it incredibly accurate and
durable add in their RGB trackball and a
spinner and we are covered for all of
our button and stick games
well what would an arcade box be without
slick shooting games your house of the
recently deceased or time conundrums
well we plugged in those light guns that
we bought expecting to be immediately
putting zombies back in the ground
and that's where we hit a major setback
who could have guessed while the gun con
twos that we obtained were technically
functional the drivers they require our
ancient and in order to install them
successfully we would have had to use
composite video not good enough for us
from a retro purist standpoint and the
other set we picked up was a used pair
of act labs USB light guns but we ended
up running into another problem with
them they were designed specifically for
PC main cabinets so we would have ended
up using Genki USB 2 game port adapters
and frankly they just felt kind of
crummy anyway so we ended up reaching
out to ultra mark hey it's us again and
they sent us these bad boys these aim
track IR light guns worked perfectly
with our system and they even fireside
way
these biatches which brings us in to
finding the right TV if you want to use
traditional light guns you will need a
CRT you can learn more about why that is
here so these ones we got locally work
and the prices were definitely right
but s-video ended up being pretty
disappointing and scaling games from
different eras was problematic so back
to eBay we went and there we managed to
procure a Toshiba pure flat CRT out of a
Namco machine that takes both retro RGB
and VGA that's important because this
thing can take signals that range from
the chunky dots that pac gentlemen eats
all the way up to the super fresh
sprites in street conflict 3 and display
them as they were originally intended
okay then so we have our hardware
together we have all the software set up
now we just need something to put it all
into now our original plan was to either
find a decommissioned arcade cabinet or
just build one ourselves out of scrap
plywood but while both of those are
valid options for sure we wanted to make
the final product as cool as possible to
show you guys just how far you can go so
we reached out to Scott over at North
Coast custom arcades and this is
actually how it went down basically
begged him to let us use one of his
ultimate arcade to cabinet kits he was
happy to oblige
and actually for good measure even
through in the classic control panel kit
and all the mounts we'd need to get our
display in place a major potential issue
for these large and heavy CRT monitors
and the end result goes without saying
is absolutely breathtaking I mean you
don't need to go all out like we did and
with high end CRTs no longer in
production some parts of the experience
are gonna get harder and harder to
recreate as time goes on
even if you
did want to go all out but we're really
glad that we took on this project with a
home arcade box you can play your
favorite games with your friends just
like you might have as a kid way back in
the 80s 90s or 2000s with the buttons
and joysticks feeling exactly how you
remember them the screen and emulators
surprising authenticity helped drive
that home and with our custom cabinet
the whole thing just exudes quality like
we just put together a kit from Sega or
Namco themselves for our bowling alley
quarter muncher not that it needs to
munch quarters anymore that's the real
reason people invest hundreds and
hundreds of dollars in these things you
just have a button to continue
woo but even more than that the real
reason we built it is that a custom
cabinet like this adds a touch of retro
gaming class to any room no exception at
all
ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction I know what a concept
when you call ting to talk to customer

to find out if you'll save money on ting
when you sign up at our link you'll also
get 25 bucks and service credit or
towards a shiny new device so thanks for
watching guys and coming along on this
journey of resurrecting retro hardware
