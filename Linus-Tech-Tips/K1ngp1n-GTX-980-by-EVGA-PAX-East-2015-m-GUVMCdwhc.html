youtube.com slash kingston hyperx for
sending us here this year also thank you
to Linda calm and phantom glass alright
guys 980 kingpin from EVGA this is a
fork you might memory card with its
memory running at seven thousand and ten
megahertz and its GPU running at a 1304
base clock with a 1408 boost clock
although if you're buying a kingpin I'm
going to expect that you're going to
overclock and you'll probably get
somewhere between 1500 and 1600
megahertz fairly easily with this car
and do two things like it's dual 120
millimeter fan cooling and it's 14 phase
power supply which is fed by dual 8-pin
and pcie power and a single 6-pin PCIe
power for your overclocking delight it
comes with EV bot support a voltage
pinout and even a freaking triple bios
just in case you screw something up EVGA
has customized the i/o so it's all on
one line with DVI HDMI and tripled mini
DP so that if you were to watercool this
card it would actually be a true single
slot card which is pretty sick last but
not least is the aesthetic improvements
along with that beautiful back plate
which you guys have probably been seeing
throughout this video there's for
customizable LED zones which are all RGB
LEDs and customizable in software this
card being released about a month ago
might feel a little awkward with the new
Titan announcement which just happened a
few days ago but it might not be
completely obsolete yet it is an
expensive eight-hundred-dollar card but
we don't know how much the Titans going
to cost it is very likely that the Titan
may not cost exactly 999 it might be
1,300 1,400 1,500 dollars which may make
this card still make sense in the future
I guess I'll just have to wait and see
