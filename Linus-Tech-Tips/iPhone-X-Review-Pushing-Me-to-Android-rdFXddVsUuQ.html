didn't get an iPhone 10 until dbrand
actually bought one skinned it and
shipped it to me but unlike some people
I'm not gonna make a big salty song and
dance out of it because frankly if I was
Apple I probably wouldn't feel like
spending the thousand dollars or even
three hundred and seventy dollars to
hear what I'm about to say about their
latest and greatest either especially in
front of their store which is under
innovation I wanted to do this in front
of the cube today's videos brought to
you by Mac Weldon I was gonna wear the
shirt but it's so cold

now if the iPhone 8 and the 8 plus are
fraternal twins then the 10 is kind of
like the lovechild from that brief but
intense affair that everyone knows mom
had but that no one talks about unless
Uncle Gordon's had too much to drink
Apple reused almost every major internal
component making the 10 with it's beefy
battery 3 gigs of ram and dual rear
camera system something familiar kind of
like a plus in a regular-sized body and
yet something totally different because
as I fix it revealed in their fantastic
teardown to achieve this spectacular
density they actually went back to a
technique so old we haven't seen it
since the original iPhone a dual PCB
internal layout that in another creative
move uses dual lithium-ion batteries for
maximum density but while in some ways
physically the 10 is what I've been
asking out before 4 years less concerned
with reducing thickness and weight and
more with increasing battery life and
features like wireless charging this
comes at the cost of it feeling well
kind of heavy and thick to be clear I
still vastly prefer the form factor of
the 10 compared to the 8 plus it's size
makes it much easier to hold on to even
if it's slim bezels mean an accidental
drop is more likely to be fatal it's
just that the slight increase in
unwieldly 'no scared to the 8 is
compounded by the tens unfamiliar new
gesture-based controls before I get to
those though let's talk about the screen
I am sorely disappointed that my 120
Hertz prediction didn't come true but
otherwise it's everything that you could
hope for from a top-of-the-line phone in
2017 Apple took the best mobile OLED
screen technology on the market from
Samsung and tuned it to damn near
perfection it's the brightest OLED I've
ever seen making for the best direct
sunlight viewing experience that I've
seen yet and the best rendering of HDR
content that I've seen yet
and the ultra tall or ultra wide
depending on how you look at it aspect
ratio combined with the stereo bottom
firing and earpiece speaker combo makes
it great for watching cinema aspect
ratio content like movie is what I would
say if it weren't for the knotch
whoa now for the vast majority of the
content that you'll find on YouTube or
Netflix it's and the rounded bottom
corners will end up cut off by pillar
boxes but in movies
it is a literal black mark on what is
otherwise the standard by which mobile
displays can be measured and while it's
far less obnoxious I did also notice it
in day to day use a lot of people might
not care about something like this but
there's no room at the top anymore for
your battery percent or your VPN
connectivity status requiring a swipe
down from the top right to bring up the
control center that so what do we get in
return men in tech enthusiasts terms we
get a marvelously densely packed not to
mention incredibly sophisticated array
of sensors emitters and cameras that had
me hardcore nerding out but everyone
else just calls it face ID without
getting into the theoretically reduced
security I mean no one that I know was
able to unlock my phone here's what it
does really well downloading apps buying
stuff or logging into websites is in a
word amazing it worked nearly flawlessly
across all manner of challenging
conditions from cold days where you
don't feel like taking off your gloves
to touch to bright sunlight to pitch
blackness and even with a kid in my arms
or a toothbrush hanging out of my mouth
and the feature that hides the details
of your notifications until it
recognizes you is a biometric
authentication game-changer okay cool
now here's what's less awesome because
the 10 only Auto wakes when it's right
side up and has no obvious land
Marx when the screen is off like an
always-on clock for example and because
it requires a swipe after it identifies
you I often found that it took me longer
to unlock the 10 when I wanted to use my
phone face ID to be clear is much better
than Samsung's iris scanner
across-the-board but it still requires a
special dance move to do something on
your phone while it's sitting on the
desk or table next to you and back to
that notification hiding thing I really
wish that it was a little bit faster
like I've been using my old iPhone 6 as
an mp3 player lately and then I forgot
how much worse first gen touch ID was
and how much better fast biometrics are
compared to just having them at all
all right fine then Apple a notch in the
display for unlocking with wet hands ok
I can wait a little longer for you to
put all this stuff behind the panel and
besides the notch actually bothered me
far less than the interface and
navigation changes that were
necessitated by the tens lack of a home
button all the new gestures are easy to
remember and felt natural within minutes
to the point where I actually found
myself swiping up on other devices but
multiple aspects of the new control
scheme are marginally slower reinforcing
my belief that Apple is either run by or
caters to people who just don't have a
lot to do these people I assume have all
the time in the world to type names into
their address book like a cave person
instead of using t9 dialing interact
with their touch screen however little
it might be to quick launch their camera
instead of double tapping a hardware
button they have time to pause mid
gesture to wait for multitasking to show
up instead of pressing one button
though the slide to the right is quite a
bit better they have time to hold then
swipe or reach to the top of the screen
to force close a frozen app and finally
and yes I'm repeating this one they
don't mind swiping their screen every
time they unlock their phone
now I'm not saying that Apple did
nothing right here control center from
the top right is much more reliable now
that it no longer gets confused by the
on-screen keyboard and on that subject
the dictation button under the on-screen
keyboard is super convenient which wait
a second under the keyboard ah leave it
to Apple to figure out the most obvious
stuff that everyone else missed I've
been complaining for years that on
devices with small chin bars it's harder
to touch type and they just went and put
a space in there brilliant anyway in
fairness to Apple the navigation isn't
terrible it's just also not as
advertised it's not like a quantum leap
forward in the way that I interact my
phone and if anything it makes me miss
the Android back button even more than I
normally do on iOS not less now I'm not
gonna spend a ton of time on the camera
or an emojis other than to say that if
you liked the excellent 8 plus camera
and if you're a portrait mode bokeh
fiend you'll like the TENS camera I will
be even less inclined to create awkward
moments in public than I already am so
that brings me then to my conclusion the
original iPhone was first in execution
of a brilliant idea and the device that
was created to celebrate its 10-year
anniversary his brilliant execution of
what feels like a first gen idea it
really seems to me like Apple was trying
really hard to make an innovative device
then make you like whatever they ended
up with rather than looking forward to
what people wanted to do in their lives
and building a solution around that an
approach that probably would have
involved some more investment in Siri
so bottom line then the iPhone 10 is
what it took to make me more excited
about the 8 and the 8 plus and
ultimately go back to the S 8 so that I
can stop carrying around this stupid bag
of headphone doggles
so this video was brought to you by the
