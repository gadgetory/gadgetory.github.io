Computex 2016 this year check out their
lap dog in the video description down
below also thank you to msi for bringing
us here they have their graphics card
which we're going to check out right now
we're going to start with their gaming
x8 G it has a twin frozer 6 cooler a
core clock of 1847 megahertz and a
memory clock of 10,000 108 the Twin
Frozr six cooler has six heat pipes one
eight millimeter and five six millimeter
heat pipes and they've changed the
design a little bit instead of them
being like cylindrical heat pipes right
when they come in towards the block they
turn into basically squares so it has a
flat design which should have more
surface area transfer to the block there
has also been improvements to the fan
blades as you come down the fan blades
on half of them they kind of dip in a
little bit this angle has increased
compared to the Twin Frozr five design
it should theoretically improve cooling
they are also now dual ball bearing fans
we then have the gaming z8 G which is
actually right beside it and as far as
you guys can see right now is
aesthetically exactly the same but on
the backplate on the 8 G instead of
having just a metal dragon logo there's
now an RGB color dragon shield
outside of that I don't have clock
speeds and there are no changes to the
cooler and the board design is the same
but we do know that the clock speed will
be at least over 1900 on the core which
is pretty sweet they're also showing off
the MSI high-bandwidth sli bridge which
will allow you to basically double the
bandwidth that you would normally get
over an SLI bridge that is because they
are teaming the connections this is good
if you need to do things like really
high resolutions surround or other
things that take up massive amounts of
bandwidth between the cards we'll have a
video on this and other forms of SLI
coming later on on the line of spec tips
channel next up we have the msi armor
1080 this is slightly lower end than the
other two this is now a twin frozer five
instead of Twin Frozr six has a clock
speed of seventeen ninety seven on the
core and 10010 on the memory and on the
back doesn't have a backplate that kind
of stuff but should run you a little bit
lower in terms of the cost apartment
which would be nice then stepping down
one more rung we have the msi armor 1080
this is a core clock of 1797 at a memory
clock of ten thousand and ten
it also features your last generation
Twin Frozr five coolers so the same heat
pipes and fan design and all that kind
of stuff that you guys are used to and
then no back plate this time around and
then finally we have the MSI arrow 1080
this is reference of a reference card
you can get but it is the MSRP card so
you get it for $5.99 if you want a 1080
and you want it as cheap as you can get
there you go it's running stock speeds
of 1733 on the core and 10010 on the
memory and is a like rear exhaust style
cause you're not going to be blowing air
on to the inside of the case it's going
to be ejecting out of the back that's it
for graphics cards from MSI let me know
which one you would go for in the
comments down below
thinking of course there again for bring
us here this year their lapdog allows
you to use a full sized keyboard and
mouse like player carry 70 or something
to play games on the couch on your TV
which is pretty cool also thank you to
well MSI you've now seen their graphics
card video which was this one but we're
also going to check out the aigis X
desktop in a moment so stay subscribed
for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
