both the number and number s variant of
an iPhone why you might ask well maybe
it's happening because I've gone full
mainstream that is when I'm not busy
running to gaming systems off a single
tower like I did in this recent video or
maybe it's because the 6s is
legitimately our really interesting
phone maybe even more so than the six
before it what makes it so interesting
you might ask I guess we'll find out
won't we
these cell cases are exquisitely
finished bumper cases made of wood and
aluminum for the iphone 5 6 and 6s
series products they're stylish slim
minimalistic and just plain gorgeous
check out the link in the video
description to learn more for better or
for worse other than the new pink color
and yes it's pink rose gold Apple has
changed pretty much nothing about the
device outwardly in spite of outcry
about the antenna panty lines or the
ever-popular rumors about Apple removing
headphone jacks or doing away with the
physical home button it is to the naked
eye indistinguishable to anyone but a
member of Cook's cult from the previous
generation device which isn't to say at
all that this is the same phone being
repackaged and sold to us as if it's new
they really did change a lot first there
was the knee-jerk reaction to the iPhone
6 pluses bendgate Fiasco which was to
assure us that the new phone is made of
7000 series aluminum oh then there's the
really cool under the hood stuff like
man this is great if the S is for speed
then wow did the engineers ever take
that to heart first you've got the new
a9 CPU which is lightning fast in single
threaded tasks and even surprisingly
competitive with quad and eight core
processors in multi-threaded workloads
not to mention its chart-topping new GPU
which is useful for accelerating a lot
more than games by the way with video
and image processing workloads both
being capable of utilizing a graphics
processor second while Apple retains
that inexcusable $900 16 gig model a
capacity that cost $500 off contract
back in February of 2008 by the way they
have at least acknowledged that Ram has
gotten cheaper and have finally upped
the ante when it comes to system memory
giving both the 6s and the 6s plus a
bump to two gigs for better multitasking
which coming back to storage leads to
our next s bullet point the on-board
storage it's noticeable like day-to-day
Oh
ABB's switching between them floating
webpages noticeable that the 6s is fast
and it's too much of an improvement over
the six for it to be CPU speed alone but
I have no idea why until I read Joshua
ho from a non Tech's early benchmarks of
the 6s where he figured it out Apple
engineered an nvme SSD controller for
this new lineup no wonder it feels so
fast we're talking about a phone with
storage that's nearly twice the speed of
other flagship devices out there that
are still using MMC holy crap and there
are actually a few more s notes before
we move on the AC Wi-Fi now appears to
be wave 2 which resulted in the
following speeds compared to our iPhone
6 on a ruckus our 710 access point
running on a gigabit fiber internet
connection the S six supports LTE
advanced if you're one of the lucky
bastards with service in your area and
the fingerprint scanner is more reliable
when covered with grime or water and it
is lightning fast now like to the point
where it's actually kind of inconvenient
if you're like me and habitually wake
your phone to view notifications with
the home button they'll be gone before
you even have a chance to see them
enough about speed though let's talk
about 3d touch right now the way it's
used in some cases is just kind of a
party trick a really cool well executed
party trick but if we're being honest
with ourselves the amount of time that
you save force touching the camera app
and then clicking selfie versus
launching the camera with a gesture like
you can do on some Android handsets and
then choosing selfie mode is not
significant where it really got my
attention was in Safari where it
legitimately changed the way that I
browsed the web similarly to how tabbed
browsing did for me on the desktop like
I'm I'm a skimmer so being able to force
touch articles or threads in a forum and
read now in a new tab or save for later
is flippin awesome and I can see this
being used in so many ways because now
with forced touch we effectively have
three different clicks that we can
execute on a single thing you've got
your short your long press and then
you've got your D
press and like I said in my 2015 MacBook
video it just feels great to use like I
complain about crappy vibration motors
and phones but for the most part the
guys that are doing it well have all
been doing it the same level of pretty
well for a while
ah this is a whole new level it's easy
to feel while it's next to you it is
damn near silent when it's not next to
you so you don't get that noise with the
only disadvantage here being that it's
kind of hard to find if you accidentally
drop it between a couch cushion like I
did good thing for me though I had an
Apple watch on when I did that so I was
able to ping it with that little feature
which is about the only good experience
I had with the Apple watch first gen
while I was doing this review I was
really hoping that watch OS 2 would
change my mind about the Apple watch and
I could justify doing a full review of
watch OS 2 but that's not going to
happen
time travel is slower than just swiping
through events would be and the way that
it desperately clings to its pathetic
battery life makes for a terrible
experience I feel bad for me and
everyone else who bought one still which
on the subject of software I guess leads
us to iOS 9 there's still a lot of
random stuff that drives me crazy
clearing the search field and Apple map
still requires me to click again to
start typing a new address and that
ridiculous multitasking rolodex thing
that I thought we all agreed was bad in
Windows Vista why is that back in
fashion and holy s--t Apple implement t9
dialing if you're watching this it's
2015 let me dial the numbers that
correspond to the names of my contacts
it is way faster than going through the
contacts list and you know what some
people have more than you know 10
contacts ok it's way better on a more
positive note Apple continues their
excellent support of older devices
something that many Android users poopoo
noting that performance is often
degraded in these cases but I personally
prefer to have in gaping security holes
and what was it something like 87% of
the user base out there so there's that
and on the subject of features they've
added some welcome stuff like that handy
Proactive thing when you swipe to the
left that shows you you know cool nearby
stuff relevant news that kind of thing
they've got this cool battery life
widget for your phone and your connected
devices and the today pulldown the
scrubbing browsing feature in photos I
absolutely love especially when combined
with the HTC Zoe asked snippets of live
action with a second and a half on
either side of the shutter press that go
along with your still photos in live
photo mode those are cool and then
there's about sixty other some odd cool
things this isn't a comprehensive iOS 9
review check out the article linked in
the video description on iPhone hacks
calm for a more complete list back to
photos in the meantime though the rear
camera is great but not nearly as
revolutionary as you might think given
the huge megapixel bump from eight to
twelve I mean to be clear it's very
competitive with the galaxy s6 and the
LG g4 but so was the iPhone 6 and if you
do a lot of low-light photography or 4k
video recording which by the way it
records 4k now which is cool the lack of
optical stabilization in the non plus
model will hurt you that is to say
unless you happen to be rocking inline
skates when it's time to capture a
moment the selfie camera is a big
improvement it's 5 megapixels now and I
guess having the screen boost its
brightness to act as a pseudo flash is
better than nothing but I still prefer
the super wide angle lens on the galaxy
s6 for my self-portraits which I guess
leads us finally to the conclusion you
can like Apple orb you can hate Apple I
don't care and frankly I doubt that they
do either but what I'm tired of hearing
from the haters in particular is Apple
doesn't innovate innovate a new thing to
criticize them though I mean sure Apple
didn't invent the idea of higher
resolution displays being better when
they launched the iPhone 4 they didn't
invent fingerprint scanners for
authentication with the 5s and they sure
as hell didn't invent fast storage being
critical for overall system performance
with the 6s but what they did do is
implement these technologies in a
compelling way in a real product that
isn't just a tech demo the 6 didn't
impress me it was on hey I can make a
bigger phone to response to the changing
mark
place and did nothing to lead the
industry the 6s on the other hand is a
striking return to form and takes the
place of the iPhone 4
as my favorite iPhone yet this is a
device that has so much to offer that
Apple didn't even feel the need to draw
attention to the fact that it's just
about as water-resistant as any other
phone on the market it's a device that I
feel like you could buy with confidence
knowing that it will last a long time
before there is a meaningful reason to
need an upgraded iPhone that is to say
unless they finally decide at some point
to compromise a millimeter here or there
and deliver a 4.7 inch device with a
half decent sized battery in it I made
it through the day without a charger
only about 70% of the time but for some
reason we all accept that aspect of the
iPhone experience so I guess complaining
about it won't do me any good and on the
subject of complaints we've had a few
complaints that our phones always have
those vinyl skins on them in our b-roll
and so we took those complaints and we
burned them in a fire today's episode
sponsor is D brand you head over to deep
brand calm you put in whatever device
you've got whether it's an iPhone 6s or
whether it's a Playstation 4 or like
MacBook or they even do game controllers
those ones are freaking cool and then
you go ahead you go through their
customizer utility which is awesome and
gives you a really great idea of what
your device is going to look like you
pay a reasonable price for a
high-quality vinyl skin and then you pay
$3 flat shipping to have it shipped to
you they've got tons of happy customers
they're one of the sponsors that we get
just boatloads of positive feedback
about they've got great customer service
and overall we can't say enough positive
things about d-brane
so we'll phones continue to have D brand
skins on them in our reviews yes they
will so there you go thanks for watching

you're done doing all that stuff and
you're wondering what to watch next
check out this video where I actually

compared to some other top-tier devices
like the Galaxy s6 edge as well as the
LG g4</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
