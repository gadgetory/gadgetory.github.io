from CES 2017 to check out their new
rising processors
check out the link in the video
description down below are you lacking
desk space but still want a baller PC or
maybe you have a really badass home
theater setup and you want to have a PC
there but none of the cases on the
market actually reached the level of
awesome aesthetic that you currently
have going on
well enter project 2-1 7 so it's a case
and it's rather stunning how does it
work well starting at the bottom you
have an SFX power supply you can put an
ATX power supply in here but I seriously
doubt you would need it with an ITX and
single graphics card build so just go
with an SFX or SFX L power supply
slightly above that they have a metal
bit that covers up the excess cables
coming out of the power supply across
the way to the left you have radiator
brackets for 280 millimeter or 240
millimeter setups and then just in the
middle between those two you could mount
a reservoir if you used a little adapter
to go off one of your fans moving up
from there you have your mounting area
for your ITX motherboard and just in
front of that you have something
actually rather cool i'm it doesn't have
a proper name yet but i'm going to call
it the fantex cable concealer and it
actually hides a lot of the cables that
you have to run to your motherboard
making this whole chamber actually very
clean in terms of cable management just
with two main implementations a shroud
over your power supply and a bar that
goes across the front of your
motherboard but what about the GPU the
PS de resistance of many cases is not
actually shown here well if you go
around to the other side of the case BAM
right there
now this is a prototype they're thinking
about maybe make it so you can flip this
over so you could see the the bottom of
the graphics card where the fans are
because that's often the coolest part
but it may not be too bad as it is
because a lot of back plates are
starting to look pretty sweet these days
traveling to the top of the case there
is a metal grille they're still deciding
on what exact color they want this to be
they have black and silver options here
I think right now they'll probably go
with the black one just because it fades
away more easily into home theater
setups but we'll see what they decide on
in the end under that grille reveals all
of your eye
your graphics card in your motherboard
and all that stuff and it is channeled
out the back of the case as of right now
there is no case panel IO on the system
that we have here but they're not
releasing this till sometime around
Computex which is in a few months and
they're looking into stuff maybe
something down near the bottom I have a
solution for that and after you're done
building your system in here and making
sure it looks absolutely beautiful
another cool thing is that you can put
it in pretty much any orientation you
want it doesn't have to sit exactly like
this you could turn it to one of the
sides you could turn it to the other
side or you can even put it on end tip
it over make it go wide format instead
of narrow and tall that could look
pretty cool too I personally think this
will be a great addition to fantex case
lineup but let me know what you guys
think in the comments down below thanks
once again to AMD for sponsoring our CES
2017 coverage their new Radeon Vega GPU
will introduce a new memory architecture
that sports high bandwidth cache you can
learn more about Vega by visiting V EGA
and checking out after the uprising on
youtube you can click to see that up
