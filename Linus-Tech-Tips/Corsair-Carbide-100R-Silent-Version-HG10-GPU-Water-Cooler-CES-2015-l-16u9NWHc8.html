brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX so we're here in the Corsair
suite with everybody's favorite Corsair
PM for cases Jorge how many case PM's do
you have a Corsair I'm the only one all
right so you're definitely definitely
our favorite but also the worst yes also
best and worst at the same time so show
us what travesty you've you're showing
off for the show here no I'm just I'm
just messing with you these look like an
improvement to me what what are they
exactly these are the horrors we've
unleashed upon you so we released last
year the spec a1 spec go to inspector 3
which are kind of gaming focused
value-priced cases all oldest and they
were designed basically for South
America Asia some gaming focused stuff
we had a lot of people to like the
chassis but said can you do a like a
more refined and cleaner design and so
that's what this is the same exact
chassis is a Spectre one we put kind of
a 200-hour style front on the front and
called it a 100-hour so it's a very
clean minimalistic black front it's
textured to look like aluminum dual USB
3 ports room for 2 140 millimeter fans
in front to 120s on top and 120 and back
and then you've got a seven slots power
supply on bottom dust filter on the
bottom the mesh is intake from the side
here and then for hard drive bays inside
for SSDs or regular drives cable routing
holes all that stuff so for 49 bucks
it comes with one 120 millimeter fan 2
USB 3 ports it's pretty pretty solid 50
bucks for $10 more for $59 you can get
the 100 our silent Edition which well it
is plugged in and that probably broke
that's alright it's the only one we own
this is 100 Islanders and same exact
chassis inside but it gets rid of the
window and picture the top mesh because
we wanted to make it quieter and the
windows and top mesh actually hurt noise
level production so what we want to do
is take that out put sound damping top
sides in front we added a 3-speed fan
control switch right there and it comes
with a second one 20 millimeter fan so
you can get better airflow through it
when it's quieter so that is $59 so for
$10 more you get the silent version so
there's the 100
our and 100 our silent edition both of
you available in February and here's
your mic back so I mean my feedback on
the spec was the spec oh one the red one
that I checked out before so my feedback
on that was actually surprisingly good
for a $50 case there was one thing that
I kind of wandered about and it was that
little piece that covers the the the the
access for the PCI slot covers what was
the deal with that is that like a
cost-saving measure or or what
absolutely yeah so if you look at the
back of most cases there's a second
piece it's a single piece of steel it's
stamped and there's a second piece
that's inlaid into that and actually to
get down to kind of $49 and maintaining
other features like USB 3 and this is D
compatibility we wanted to make that a
single large piece in the back but you
can't stamp that depth in easily so what
you do is you stamp it all flush and
then you have the the video cards pop
out and then you have to have a separate
card adapter on that so you see a lot of
lower price and value cases will do that
and sometimes even guys that are a
little bit less scrupulous will use a
cheaper chassis that has that feature
and add a couple other things in charge
99 100 bucks for that so there's some
other guys out there to do that but we
use that basically on our value price
case as budget price cases like this one
well so basically I had to choose
between sort of rolled edges in here and
slicing open my fingers or having an
ugly piece of metal in the back and you
guys went with what will go with the
ugly piece of metal in the back and the
saved fingers yeah if you got to do
something ugly put it in the back even
that's kind of how I feel about it
that's why I sit in the back of
restaurants so your your a boobs guy the
ugly can be in the back all right let's
move on to the cooler all right we got
another product from George here this is
the hg 10 is that correct and so the
idea behind this is you take an
all-in-one cooler presumably you guys
would like people to use a Corsair one
but will work with other ones anything
that is a stick source that I've tried
it will work so some of the NZXT stuff
works but of course our products are
superior in all ways right okay got it
and so the idea is they take a Corsair
liquid cooler bolt it to their video
card in a way that's a little bit more
elegant than what we've seen in the past
with zip ties or whatever else but what
weather what are the results look like
for an HD 10 versus a stock card you
guys have got them running side-by-side
here yeah so the important thing is is
unlike just kind of having a bracket
that attaches the GPU
Heydrich or to a GPU this is actually
heatsink to so it hooks up to the V RMS
it hooks up to the memory which means
that it needs to be made specifically
for that card so this is the M 780
Edition and this is the one for the
nvidia 777 87 80 i tighten and tighten
black which i'll use the same layout for
the V RMS and the memory so that's what
this one's for it'll allow you to work
with any of our coolers and what it
really does is right now it's cooling
the GPU and the memory and VRMs much
better with an H 75 cooler it's kind of
our mid-range cooler with some very low
speed SP 120 LED fans on it and what we
have right now is it's running at 58
degrees C on the GPU at full fur mark
load after about half an hour from rec
here and on the standard reference card
on the 780 it's running at 83 so there's
a 25 degree difference here importantly
also the RPM of the blower fan is 2700
rpm here and we're down at 79 RPM there
so it's significantly quieter as well
and then that means something
significantly we are actually thermally
throttle so the Nvidia reference design
cooler is throttling itself down to 823
megahertz ours is running at the full
speed and that adds another five or six
percent performance even in just fur
mark so I mean and in five to six
percent doesn't sound like a lot but if
it's a free five to six percent then you
know I'll take it but it's not free is
it it's not free it costs $39 for the
bracket because it's an aluminum bracket
you reuse the blower from the stock card
because it cools the VRMs in the memory
you have to use a reference design board
because these other guys are doing kind
of custom boards but if you're buying a
custom card that has a big custom
heatsink on it you bought that
specifically for that heatsink you know
so this is really for guys who have a
reference board and want to use a new
way of cooling it so if you you know you
have a seven eighty or a seven seven you
want to squeeze a few extra you know
drops of performance out of it this is a
good way to do that you throw an old
hydro cooler on it and you know you can
get a lot of performance out and spend a
whole bunch of money and buy a whole new
card so you guys aren't really pitching
this is the kind of thing that you
expect someone to buy a hydro cooler by
the hg 10 and and cool their card this
is more like if they you have a hydro
kind of sitting in a closet somewhere
and you're not really using you've
upgraded to something else that can work
that way I mean a lot of people even
though it's counterintuitive a lot of
people will still kind of use the the
best cooler in their case to cool a CPU
even though the GPU produces much more
heat so realistically you know you're at
2
300 watts of heat on some of these
graphics cards and only you know 100 or
89 watts or whatever on the the CPU and
people will still use a $100 CPU cooler
and some generic run-of-the-mill thing
that comes with a graphics card but if
you want to you can go buy a new cooler
for this you can use whatever you have
in your closet it'll work with you know
an 855 875 each 100 all that stuff we do
have versions for the N 970 and an 980
coming out very soon so you'll see those
in the next few months but this one's
going to be hitting the market first cuz
there's a ton of 700 series cards out
there and there's a lot of people who
would like to get a little bit extra
performance out of it but they don't
really want to buy a whole new 970 or
980 because the performance is only a 10
12 15 percent difference and they might
as well get a bit extra for most of the
cars they have fair enough all right so
thank you very much for sharing with us
about the sleeker edition of the speckle
one a case that I actually liked uh
surprisingly a lot given that it was a
fifty dollar case as well as the
upcoming liquid coolers guys give a
shout-out to George in the comments
below you guys know you love him he's
the best darn case p.m. at Corsair and
