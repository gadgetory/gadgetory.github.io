this video together a little bit but
this is going to be my final video about
the power consumption of the gtx 480
4-way SLI you can see my cards are
slightly overclocked here but not not by
a tremendous margin and here I'm going
to take a baseline idle temperature
reading so I'm at 67 65 69 and 63
degrees on all four cards and what I'm
going to do is I'm going to run 3dmark
vantage along with a couple instances of
prime 95 in the background and the cat
is moving the projector don't do that
here get it get away from there founded
mouse well it's not a real Mouse it's
like a 20 minutes but no please it over
there okay so yeah those are my baseline
temperatures and we're going to have a
closer look with 3dmark vantage running
with a couple instances of prime 95 in
the background I think you will find the
results quite um interesting the jane
nash test hovers between about 900 watts
to about 1,100 watts you can see the
she's getting in the boat right now so
sitting at about a thousand watts from
the wall and this one there's kind of a
funny thing that i that i want to show
you here as the plane starts to take off
the fans ramp up on the video cards
check this out I don't know if you'll
the other here or not
happens every time in that particular
benchmark but the new Calico one is
actually the one that I see a little bit
more power consumption on and while I'm
waiting for that to load why don't I
talk a little bit about the heat output
this system pretty much instantly heats
up the room I'm in here so I'm just
going to kind of stand in the center and
look around so you can see about how big
this room is and you can pretty much
forget about gaming with the door closed
if you have a system like this as soon
as you flip the switch on some kind of
3d application it gets hot so you can
see new calicos already up around 1200
watts I've seen this one peak as high as
about thirteen hundred watts but just on
the topic of heat again really quick
here I just want to talk a little bit
about what's going on at the back of the
system so from here I mean I can feel
the heat being blown out the back of
this case it's about like a space heater
from a distance like this and then even
the heat pipes that don't have any
active airflow pushing the heat away
from it I can feel it radiating off
there at about probably five six inches
away and even the stickers that are on
the back of these video cards have been
all peeled off just by operating for for
a couple days here on the weekend so let
me see what our power consumptions like
now yeah so we're sitting at about nine
hundred and thirty wats so basically the
worst case scenario I've seen is around
1,200 1,200 25 watts or rather sorry
1300 1300 25 watts so even like that
you're only actually pushing about 1,100
watts DC you've got about 400 watts to
spare on this 1500 watt silverstone
strider modular power supply I'm just
going to exit the benchmark now so you
can have a look at the actual card
temperatures now understand this is a
little bit of a warm room but that's the
reality of it is if you're if you're
running these cards and you're not
outside it's a warm room so you can see
that we peeked around 87 degrees on the
top 1 88 on the next one 88 and then 90
so that bottom one which doesn't have
the proper ventilation slot actually
doesn't get that much hotter but it does
get a couple degrees hotter than the
other
cards so thank you for checking out my
series of videos on the gtx 480 4-way
sli i'm going to go ahead and tear the
system down now but it was definitely
fun and maybe i'll play with it a little
bit more before I before I completely
tear it apart oh yeah one other thing I
wanted to say right with about 400 watts
of extra capacity this is a pretty
bare-bones system I've only got three
dims of memory in here I haven't got any
hard drives I'm just running like one
SSD so you throw like you know five or
six hard drives in there couple optical
drives some more RAM you're still going
to be quite comfortable but this system
is like I wouldn't even use a 1200 watt
power supply to power this anything less
than the silverstone strider 1500 which
is one of the only such power supplies
on the market is pretty much what I'd
recommend and that was a big part of the
reason why i asked silverstone if we
could feature them in this video's or in
this series of videos so thank you for
checking them out and now i'm actually
done and yeah obviously in any warm area
there's bound to be cats lurking about</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
