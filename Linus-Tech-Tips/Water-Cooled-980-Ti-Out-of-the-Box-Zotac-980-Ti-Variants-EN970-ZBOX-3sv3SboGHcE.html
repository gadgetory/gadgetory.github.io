Computex this year and also thank you to
Linda calm first up at ZOTAC we have a
new Z box mainly designed behind their
steam machine that we actually saw at
PAX East but now with more
customizability in mind with the steam
machine it was all one package
this one is customizable also instead of
the like white and silver design of the
old steam machine z box what old is a
kind of weird name because it's not even
out yet it is now an all black out
designed also something to note that LED
ring around the power button on the
front can actually be turned off in the
bios just because you don't want that
light there also it's called an en 974
now but I'll have a better name going in
the future so I'm not entirely sure what
it will be called the pro model will
have eight gigs of RAM and 128 gigabyte
SSD inside of it but the more bare-bones
version will have two two and a half
inch drive slots - like a laptop style
so dim memory ddr3 slots 1 m2 slot it
will come with an i5 Broadwell 5200 u
processor and NVIDIA 970 m with three
gigabytes of ddr2 fooling to hopefully
keep it from throttling in terms of i/o
on the front we have an SD card reader a
microphone jack a headphone jack and two
USB 3.0 ports on the back you have a
Wi-Fi antenna for hdmi 2.0 ports 2
gigabit ethernet ports two USB 3.0 ports
and two USB 2.0 ports plus the power
plug then we get two graphics cards they
have four different versions of the
980ti and I know that's a lot but will
go fairly quickly don't you worry about
it the first one is the 980ti amp just
their standard edition this is only $10
more than the reference card it's a
pretty good deal for a triple fan cooler
it's the same cooler that we've seen in
the past I won't spend too much time on
that but the backplate on here is a
wraparound so it looks kind of cool and
the 980ti doesn't have a backplate by
reference so that's actually pretty nice
the amp Omega Edition is the same kind
of overall cooler no major differences
other than the fact that it's
two-and-a-half slots and the fans have
dual blades on them last but not least
of the more standard air coolers is the
amp extreme which has more or less the
same cooler as the amp Omega but it has
lights on the front and lights on the
top and then in terms of overclocking
it's a freaking beast its base core
clock is 1253 with a boost clock of 13
fifty-five at a memory clock of 7210 and
then we get to the arctic storm which is
probably just as cool as it sounds it
has the same wraparound back plate as
the previous ones but now it has a kind
of cool Arctic II styled Art Deco on it
it's really really heavy due to the fact
that it's a water cooled or air-cooled
card and therefore comes with the
support bracket which is not currently
shown as they don't have it here but it
will enable you to screw it onto the end
of the card and then fix it to either
the bottom or top of your case to help
support it as again it's a really heavy
card you don't want it to droop and
potentially crack now the Arctic storm
doesn't have much of an overclock on it
by default now you might have expected
more in this realm but they're expecting
you to want to overclock this card
yourself as it's kind of like a
water-cooled hybrid card thingy I don't
really necessarily blame them for that
all right guys let me know what you
think about things in general I know I
covered like five things of this booth
so just let me know what you think about
stuff in the comments down below or on
twitter at luke underscore la AFR don't
forget to subscribe follow share
favorite like dislike any of those
things just do all of them although like
and dislike is a variable so pick one
also thank you to MSI for sending this
to you this year we would not be at
Computex 2015 without them so they were
a huge help in the link in the video
description down below that's the bitly
link you can see all the products that
they launched at Computex this year
including Broadwell enabled laptops also
thank you to lynda.com lynda.com slash
Computex if you go there you can get a
10 day free trial and start learning
right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
