storage service sorry can you even hear
me over this thing the last time I
updated y'all on the storage server that
is used to manage all the data that's
constantly flowing around here was back
in 2012
I mean Linus media group wasn't even a
company running out of my garage yet
today's video is going to be a close
look at one of the new servers that
we're adding before the move to our new
office and the $1500 Oh
network switch that's going to be
directing traffic on our new and
improved fully ten gigabit network
fractal design listens and the define r5
case was made with feedback from you the
PC community so click wherever you want
to learn more about here and here
alright so let's start with a look at
our new network switch it's not that our
old GS 752 TSX sucks or anything it's
got a ton of regular gigabit ports and
enough internal throughput that we'd be
really hard-pressed to even put a
significant load on it as things stand
but while for sfp+ 10 gigabit capable
ports was fine in the old days when we
only had three employees total we've
grown to eight team members now four of
which will need access to a handful of
servers at lightning-fast speed at all
times so we're going to be adding a net
gear XS 7 12 T 12 port 10 gigabit
ethernet switch so here's a diagram of
how the network layout is going to work
we'll use two of our existing 10 gigabit
ports running in a teaming mode called
LACP and direct-attached copper cables
to connect the sfp+ ports on our new 12
ports which bear in mind that this
renders two of our rj45 ports inactive
so this will give us a total of 20
gigabits of connectivity speed between
these two switches this is important
because our main high-performance
storage server general bulk storage
server will be on the excess 712 T side
of things so let's say a hypothetical 40
some-odd gigabit clients from the other
side all wanted to hit it at once we
want them to have a nice fat pipe to
reduce bottlenecks the next high-speed
20 gigabit link will be to teemed 10
gigabit ethernet connections to our
brand-new server that I'm building today
Wanek server will be replacing our
current storage server ruskin server as
the day-to-day performance server it
will deliver slightly better drive
performance thanks to its faster Adaptec
60 805 raid card but since Ruskin's
server has such a massive array of 10 3
terabyte Seagate consumer drives in raid
6 some of which are actually refurbished
and incredibly irresponsible setup but
one that delivered most
the space we needed and that we couldn't
afford to replace up until now hmm
this one won't deliver that much more
storage and actually not that much more
speed it's instead focused on
reliability so it uses eight Seagate
enterprise-grade
six terabyte drives in raid six for a
total of 36 terabytes of storage that
can lose up to two drives before
suffering catastrophic data loss and on
top of that their drives that are
actually designed for this workload
instead of general consumer drives and
there's some other cool stuff going on
in the server as well so the revision of
Ruskin's server that I showed off in
this video when we first went to 10
gigabit was using some weaksauce ITX
board and the low-power LGA 1156 of xeon
that stuff's for chumps man the backbone
of Wanek server system is much beefier
we're using an ass rock x99 WS e 10g and
x99 motherboard with basically every
single bell and whistle and then some
that weighs in at a whopping $600 it
works with Intel Xeon processors
although that's not something that's
officially sanctioned by Intel since it
runs a consumer x99 chipset with our
plan being to install an e5 26 18 L
low-power eight core four great
multi-threaded performance and very low
power consumption it can also handle up
to seven pcie 3.0 slots at 8 X 2 16 X
bandwidth giving us tons of options for
raid or other expansion it can handle up
to 128 gigs of ECC ddr4 memory although
we'll only be installing 32 gigs of
kingston valueram that was generously
provided by kingston at the moment and
last but certainly not least it's got
dual onboard 10 gigabit ethernet ports
powered by an Intel X 540 controller
that is some kick-ass onboard networking
when you consider the cost of buying an
add-in card with two rj45 ports running
that chipset so the process of building
the system was pretty straightforward
mostly I actually reached out to an old
contact of mine at Norco the rackmount
case company not the bike one who
provided the 24 drive capable RPC 42:24
that we've actually
using for Ruskin server for a really
long time and have been extremely happy
with so he sent over two more of those
cases one for Wanek to give us a lot of
growing room and another for an
additional machine that I'm hoping to
add to the network with a couple of 18
core Zeon's as a network rendering box
let me know in the comments if you want
intel to support that crazy project
maybe we can convince them might be
tough anyway so this case supports
standard ATX power supplies so I grabbed
a 520 series boot SSD a Coolermaster v8
50 80 plus gold power supply a basic
video card that I had lying around and
at our cooler that didn't end up fitting
so I grabbed an Intel stock cooler and
got to work the plan is you probably saw
on the network diagram is not to have
this server replace Ruskin outright but
rather to have Ruskin act as a nightly
backup for Wanek this has two positive
effects number one it gives us something
to switch to quickly in the middle of
the day if want experience is some kind
of problem like a failed drive corrupted
OS or whatever else and needs time to
rebuild and number two is it allows us
to practice what we preach for a change
data redundancy like raid is not the
same thing as backing up and critical
data should always be backed up once
locally and then preferably again
off-site in the event of a physical
disaster but that won't come for us
until a later stage now the astute among
you may have noticed that my diagram
also alluded to a 45 drives 100-plus
terabyte server and you might be
wondering what's up with that I wanted
to do that build log today but the parts
haven't arrived in time so you'll have
to settle for this one but the ultimate
plan when that arrives is to dump
everything on it reconfigure Wanek
server with purely solid-state storage
pull all these six terabytes out of it
and then put those in the 45 drives
store inator that we have coming for a
total of about a hundred and fifty
terabytes of raw storage that we're
going to use as an archive to replace
the awful shelf of random hard drives
system that we have going on in our
right now which will also give us quick
access to everything we've ever shot
apart from allowing us to not have to
just kind of swap drives onto an
external drive dock in order to find old
stuff so stay tuned if you're into
completely bananas storage
configurations guys because it is about
to get really interesting I mean even
now it's like pretty great except for
the fact that until the new office is
built it's going to be deployed in a
bathroom speaking of bathrooms well
actually these tools have nothing to do
with working on bathrooms the Morpher
like electronic gizmos tearing them
apart repairing them upgrading them all
that kind of stuff and they're from I
fix it so these guys have all kinds of
professional grade tools and fantastic
guides on their site ifixit.com one of
my favorites is their 54 bit driver kit
that's part of their pro tech tools tool
kit that's got a bunch of like prying
tools and tweezers and magnets for
getting stuff out of I use it for all
kinds of stuff tearing apart SSDs that
have like security Torx screws taking
apart Nintendo DS's that use trying bits
and all kinds of like triangle bit
stupid stuff that's hard to find outside
of buying an affordable kit like that
you can use it to work on all kinds of
things whether it's you know handled
gaming consoles like I said before but
I've also used it on everything up to as
big as an iMac in fact I did a teardown
with their guide with their tools of the
iMac 5k and it was super simplified I'm
not going to say super simple because
there's some complicated stuff about it
but super simplified by I fix its kit
and guide so the pro tech tool kit is 65
bucks and is backed by a lifetime
warranty and if you use the offer code
Lynas zero three at checkout you can
save $10 off any purchase of 50 bucks or
more so head over to ifixit.com slash
Linus which is linked in the video
description to check that out now so
guys thanks for watching this video like
it if you liked it dislike it if you
thought it sucked leave a comment at the
link in the video description to our
forum where you can discuss this video
if you have something to say also linked
in the video description we have a merch
link for cool t-shirts like this one a
contribution link if you love the work
we do and you think we should keep doing
it and an amazon link so you can change
your bookmark to one with our affiliate
codes whenever you buy hard drives or
whatever else we get a small kickback
