thank you to Linda calm and phantom
glass
welcome to the Intel booth at PAX East
2015 what we're going to be doing here
today is a top 5 om system showdown so
I've gone through all the crazy amount
of systems here and picked five top
systems for usually fairly unique
reasons the first one we're gonna start
with is NCIX PC we got to give them a
shout outs they're our buddies from back
home
this system is named the rogue x4 ROG
and x99 and it's a 5820k init duel 9 ATS
a 730 series intel SSD 16 gigs of ram
and a one terabyte hard drive the water
cooling system in this machine is called
a turbo hydro it's got a pump dual
radiators a whole bunch of different
fittings but my favorite part is the
quick disconnects if you had any reason
to swap all the graphics cards if they
failed if you want to do an upgrade if
you wanted to put them in different
system whatever it is you'd be able to
take these graphics cards out using the
quick disconnects to easily do that put
the quick disconnects back together
without the graphics cards and be able
to run your system totally fine which is
a sweet feature it's not hard piping
hard piping is super cool and looks
great but this is going to be easier to
work with in the long run as you can see
here these are Poseidon cards I might
have mentioned that earlier
usually NCIX PC would be installing ek
water blocks on their cards but they
just wanted to show how they can
configure Poseidon cards for you if you
wanted them you can pick pretty much
whatever the heck you want in their
systems and they'll do whatever for you
they can even put automotive grade
carbon fibre on pretty much any pc1 as
you can see here one of the tubing runs
has carbon fibre on it that was Ivan's
nice little addition but you can do
pretty much whatever you want just
contact them and they'll help you
configure whatever you need STX pcs is
one of only 10 companies in North
America that can say that they're
powered by AC species Asus puts this
certification on systems that they
believe are very well built and very
high-performing it's just a good overall
experience next up is doghouse if you
haven't heard of them I don't blame you
apparently they got the company name by
the the man who started it when in the
doghouse when his wife was kind of mad
that he started a computer business I
don't know how true that story is but I
heard that from someone that's here so
we'll see anyways there's a 59 60 X
inside and Intel 730 series SSD a 1000
watt EVGA power supply and h100 eye and
that's about it
other than the dual 980 s for
performance hardware in terms of custom
work they've added a lot of
purple LEDs including to the power
button at the top of the case although I
would have hoped that they would have
done it to the hard drive activity LED
as well instead of just the power button
but it does look pretty cool and quite
unique but the big draw for this
computer is that dog house computers
will do custom 3d printing for you so in
this one they've done a 3d printing
shroud to go to the fan at the back to
help cool your motherboard a pretty
unique and pretty cool system I haven't
really seen very many of these so it was
really cool to see it at PAX this year
alright guys next up is the exotic PC
executioner this has a 59 60 X dual 980
s a 480 gig Intel series 730 SSD and 16
gigs of DDR 4 RAM as you can see it's
very beautifully hard piped I know I was
just ragging on hard pipe a little bit
when I was checking out the NZXT PC
system but this could definitely be
something you're looking for especially
if you're not looking for rapid upgrades
in the future one thing that they did
here too is this is clear hard piping so
it actually looks like it's solid white
but that's due to the pastel nature of
their actual liquid in the system the
system is currently just leaved with the
Corsair kit but if you wanted to get
customs leaping from exotic PC that is
definitely something in the offer as
well one thing they can do too is metal
piping if you're not down with that
clear acrylic I don't know exactly what
metals they can use but I know that they
can do metal piping and if you want some
more customization as you can see this
system is lit up with LEDs you can get
your system lit up with LEDs and
controlled by an external controllers
you can like turn the lights off when
you want to go to bed or anything like
that one of the bigger jobs for the
system as well was how much it's been
painted they've got an automotive grade
painting solution where they can paint
pretty much anything and in this system
they've done up the GPU plates on the
graphics cards and the actual case
itself with their custom logos which
looks really sick they've actually also
painted the RAM I didn't notice that at
first and it wasn't just the kind of
Plasti Dip solution that Linus did in
his build log it's actually again that
automotive grade paint next up is Origin
PC they have a 59 60 X 730 series SSD a
1300 watt EVGA power supply and a 3 980
s actually most of systems here are
running one or two 9 80s but Origen went
for 3 the CPU is cooled by a triple
radiator in the Trop a triple 120
millimeter radiator in the top which
also has their own custom logo on the
block
other than customs leaving there
actually wasn't a ton of like mods done
to this case but they made it into my
showdown just because of how badass the
actual case is as you can see in this
situation they've rotated their
motherboards something super unique up
in the front they've got that really
sick hard drive cage that they have in
all of these cases which is just a
really nice adder that you don't see in
a lot of these cases so if you're
looking into something which isn't
necessarily too crazy this system can go
for you but origen off also offers a ton
of modifications if you go for one of
their other tier systems and last but
definitely not least in performance or
price is the main gear forced Superstock
in its current configuration as a 59 60
X dual nine 80s on a deluxe board with
32 gigs of RAM and a 1200 watt corsair
power supply and naturally it also has
730 series SSDs for storage but any of
this stuff is configurable you could get
more larger 730 series SSDs you get more
graphics cards this case obviously
supports up to quad graphics cards
pretty much whatever you want the
parallelized dual pump water cooling
system on this thing is nothing short of
insanity there's 85 fittings
that's enough fittings to easily cool 8
different systems if you had to use them
individually but they use all these 85
fittings to do a lot of really cool
things there's a really easy access
drain port it looks generally beautiful
throughout the entire thing but
something to remember is that just those
85 fittings alone will be around a grand
but if you're going for a 4 super stock
price probably isn't a large object for
you so I'm just going to move on from
there it has a triple 140 millimeter
radiator in the top and a quad 120
millimeter radiator in the bottom to go
along with all that nice fancy water
going to help justify the cost of the
system there's an insane level of detail
if you have a very specific color that
you need all your logos to be they can
match that with their wire comb since
they make them in-house and they'll even
color coordinate everything all the way
down to the exact Zab straps that are
all throughout the system alright guys
thanks for watching be sure to check out

or vine or whatever the heck you like to
frequent and let them know if you submit
your build or another buddies build or
build you've done or maybe even one of
these you might be able to win one of
three a core i7 Intel processors along
with definitely using that hashtag let
me know what system you like the most in
the comments down below and over on the
forum thank you guys for watching stay
subscribe to the Linus tech tips to see
all of our PAX East 2015 content alright
guys if you stay tuned for this long I
have a little surprise for you I don't
know how much I can tell you about it so
I will tell you nothing
but it is an SSD prototype and if you go
to Intel gaming promo comm slash SSD
you'll see maybe more information but
definitely a countdown timer and if you
wait for IEM or Intel Extreme Masters
they'll definitely be releasing more
info there so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
