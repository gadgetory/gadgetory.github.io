for those of you who aren't familiar
with my personal gaming machine it's a
silverstone TJ o7 with some an tech 900
case front covers so that I can have a
dual 120 millimeter radiator there in
the front and then I've also got a 980 X
CPU with 24 gigs of ram Big Bang X power
GTX 480 liquid cooled killer Z no
network card 90 260 LSI raid card hooked
up to 8 SSDs in the back got an Asus
zonar sense going on there I've got some
UV cold cathodes positioned sort of
around different places good for
lighting effects because this is UV blue
tubing I've got a quadruple 120
millimeter thermal chill rat so it's a
total of 6 by 120 with the dual 120 on
the front and the quadruple 120 in the
bottom on the back we find actually a
lot of the the cooler hardware that's
going on in here so we've got an M cubed
T balancer which helps me control all
the fan speeds so it uses the
temperatures that it gets from various
probes in order to adjust fan speeds or
even turn them off entirely when I don't
need them that is eight yeah these are
these are jet stack double here so that
is eight force 120 gig Corsair SSDs
running off that LSI RAID controller so
that is a total of 900 and whatever 800
and something gigs of SSD storage for my
boot drive hi another Mac's revolution
1050 watt power supply check out this
fluid it's like so murky needs to be
cleaned out and and replaced so that'll
be part of this procedure my trusty MTP
six five five which has been running for
about three years now without a hiccup
and I apologize for the cabling mess on
the back here but yeah yeah
yeah we're not we're not really doing
anything differently probably with it
this time around I mean there's a few
things in here that are kind of you know
sleeved but I don't worry too much about
the cabling on the back as long as the
cabling on the Front's okay and it's not
too bad
right come on guys reassure me here it's
not too bad right okay so what are we
doing first of all power supplies got to
go
it's only 80 plus silver so we'll be
replacing that with an XFX Pro 1000
limited edition 80 plus Platinum power
supply what I like about this one so
much and I mentioned this during the
unboxing is the hybrid fan control so
that switches right here which basically
allows it to turn the fan off entirely
under low loads this is a silence freak
enthusiast PC that is why I have all the
fans controlled by the t balancer most
of the fans are actually off during day
to day operation with only the ones on
the bottom radiator running at a nominal
nominal speed so adding this will allow
me to turn off this fan which has been
kind of bothering me kind of 90% of the
time any time I'm not running something
very intensive but I'll also be doing is
I will be adding silver fittings so
these are bits power true silver
compression fittings please focus please
focus there we go
bits power true silver compression
fittings to anywhere where I can put
them this will allow me to avoid having
my water gun cup like this again because
it is antimicrobial which means stuff
will not grow in the loop I will also be
upgrading to LGA 2011 so we've got an
MSI whatever this is it's a GD 65 X 79 a
GD 65 8 D haven't quite decided on the
run configuration I'm either going to
leave those copperheads in there because
they look ballin or I'll throw in my OCC
special Linus edition never existed for
anyone but me Rams Q so this is a see
matches the motherboard really really
well that was why I specifically
requested this color of spreader it's
like ddr3 2000 or something like that so
I might throw those in there and just go
for 4 dims
16 gigs haven't quite decided yet so
we'll figure that out later
and I'm also upgrading the graphics card
so from a GTX 480 I'm going to be going
with an EVGA GTX 590 classified
liquid-cooled card and the piece that I
am most proud of
oops you know what guys give me sec here
the piece that I am most proud of the
centerpiece of this build is going to be
my limited edition Swift tech Apogee HD
gold-plated water block so there it is
the limited edition stickers on there
somewhere there we go
limited edition number 169 so bling with
the bits power true gold compression
fittings
I'm normally anti 2-tone but I had to do
it so like I said I'm either gonna go
with this Ram and keep the color scheme
black and silver and blue other than the
water block or I'll leave in the
Copperheads just to have them matching
so there's going to be a couple
challenges because unlike the revolution
1050 watt which has four SATA cables per
modular connector this guy has three so
it means I might have to widen this hole
a little bit to get another connector up
there alternately I can not run this
molex and then I can use a say to the
molex adapter in order to power all this
stuff but we'll figure it out and yeah
hopefully we'll there will be some kind
of a performance improvement especially
in games I'm not expecting too much in
the way of a CPU performance boost going
from a 980 X 230 960 X but should be
able to render you guys as videos just a
little bit faster and get games going
quite a bit faster with the
liquid-cooled GTX 590 so thank you for
checking out this little teaser video of
my upgrade and I'm probably not going to
update you guys again until it's done
but who knows I might show some in
progress depends on what you guys demand
so what are we going for here we're
going for more power more efficiency and
to clean out to clean out the old water
cooling gunky loop that's become a
little bit well gunked-up
and got my cat attacking my leg so we're
going to call it quits here on this one
let's see if he wants to visit here
follow did you this thing let's see if
he jumps on my shoulder well no he just
wants to nozzle right now probably hear
him purring oh maybe not not there we go
think we're down here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
