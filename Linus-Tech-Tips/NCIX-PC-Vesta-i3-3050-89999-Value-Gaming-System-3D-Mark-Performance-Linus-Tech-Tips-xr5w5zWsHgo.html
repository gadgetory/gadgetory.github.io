a performance testing application if
you're not already familiar with it this
gives us some idea of how the system
performs in directx 11 games versus
other systems so what you can do is you
or or your friend can run 3dmark Vantage
and then you can take the score you get
at the end and you can compare it
against the Vesta I 3 30 50 so that
gives you some point of comparison for
you know what your older system runs
compared to what you can get for 900
bucks with a new system so it's not a
perfect application but it gives you at
least some baseline and you can actually
see here on the screen it's running
pretty smooth this is the new Calico
demo we're going through the ship it's I
it's kind of cool to watch especially if
you've never seen it before and yeah
well we'll be back as soon as we have
some more performance results for you so
we finished running our benchmark on the
Vesta I 3 30 50 we got over 14,000 3d
marks and this is a synthetic benchmark
it doesn't give us a perfect indication
of system performance one thing that you
will notice about this benchmark is that
it skews the results heavily in favor of
multi-core processors so we do only have
a dual core but it's not nearly as much
of a disadvantage in real games as it
might make it out to be to use a
synthetic benchmark now we do have the
performance package which will score a
lot better due to its quad-core and dual
video cards but really this puts
together a very respectable showing
given the price point and I mean really
what you can do is if you have a
dual-core if you have an older system
you can run 3dmark Vantage have a look
at what kind of score you get both for
the GPU and for the CPU and it gives you
a comparison of what a modern system can
do compared to an older PC thanks for
checking out our video on the avesta i 3
