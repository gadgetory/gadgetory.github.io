description so we are here behind the
scenes at Asus is our og event where
they are showing off
all-in-one coolers with all the sync RGB
on them and 1.7 seven-inch full-color
OLED displays yes my friends it has
actually come to this we are now putting
screens on our CPU coolers and on power
supplies - but we actually didn't get a
long time to look at that one so in a
nutshell the ROG Ryu Ryu
yes I think it's Ryu is available on
either 120 or 240 millimeter sizes in
terms of performance I wouldn't expect
anything that different from what you'd
get from an ace attack all-in-one cooler
since there's a badge right on it that
says that it's an ace attack design but
what you get is an ROG design fan this
particular one is 3d printed so
availability is going to be sometime in
q4 either not quite done yet and you get
the ability to synchronize your CPU
block with Aurra sync right back to that
display so this guy right here they're
calling it a live dash display is a full
color OLED that can either take static
images gifs or system stats and is
available in either this configuration
with the little round thing here or
everyone thinks I'm gonna drop this
piece of glass look I can pick something
up without dropping it here actually yes
you can't help me thank you
or as I was saying this one right here
so this is the higher end region I hope
I'm pronouncing that right and the main
difference is between this one and the
other one are that instead of being
available in 120 and 240 millimeter
sizes this one is 240 for the basic and
360 for the high-end one and it comes
with a more elaborate CPU block thing so
you get this shroud that sits over top
of it and you get a bulkier block design
that integrates a 60 millimeter cooling
fan that is designed to give you the
best of both worlds water cooling for
your CPU and then air cooling for your
RAM
modules and your VRMs around the socket
and as you can see we have helpfully
improved the graphics that they have
running on this one showing you that yes
you too can have my face on your CPU
block if you so desire that's right my
friends check out just go on Google
Linus kappaface right there put that on
your block no problem now you will have
to pay for the privilege they don't know
exact pricing yet but somewhere in the
neighborhood of a hundred plus for the
low-end one and like 150 plus for this
one but it's that not a fair price to
pay for my face on your CPU so thanks
