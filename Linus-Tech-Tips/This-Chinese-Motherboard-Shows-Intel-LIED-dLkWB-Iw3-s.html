generation Core Series processors they
said something that many in the tech
community were skeptical of they said
that their eighth generation processors
could not work on older LGA 1151
motherboards even though the socket was
the same and architectural II the 8th
gen is not very different from the 7th
and the 6th gen did Intel lie well we
have no way of knowing for sure but what
we do have is a weird Chinese
motherboard from brand what is this onda
something order whatever whatever this
is that not only claims to work with 6th
7th and 8th gen CPUs but do it with ddr3
this is gonna be a good one and it's
brought to you by who was it again
oh god off stream deck the elgato stream
deck the stream deck is the compact
hyper configurable keypad that allows
you to do all kinds of things I mean
really it works for anything like
streaming video editing this guy's kind
of limit check it out and get yours at
the link in the video description
now hold on just a gosh-darn moment here
so this is an h3 10 seed chipset
basically the cheapest thing that you
can solder to a motherboard to give it
support for an Intel processor mm-hmm
and is that technically 8th gen
compatible so have they gone backwards
compatible or have they taken an older
one and made it 8 gen compatible here
it's backwards compatible it's not
supposed to be backwards compatible but
in this case what they did is they took
the h3 10 chipset which is 8th gen and
they decided to just remove any of the
limits so you can run KB like you can
run Sky like you can run coffee like and
with ddr3 and those of you who know what
that means
those CPUs all have integrated ddr4
memory controllers now to be clear
Anthony's not saying that this
motherboard has no limits we can tell by
looking at it it most most assuredly has
limits this is far from a high end part
I mean do we have a full sized ATX or
even just a normal M ATX board to
compare this to okay here we go so for
perspective this is a standard full
sized ATX board this is an m-80 export
so that's anywhere from 1 to 4 expansion
slots and this is the onda we get one
PCI Express 16x slot 1 1 X slot we get
USB 3 I mean that's that's better than a
kick in the teeth 3 SATA ports cause
like I guess that was the only spare
room they could find to put them an 8
pin power connector which surprises me
on a board like this and then pretty
limited i/o PS - Wow - ps2 ports VGA out
HDMI for USB Gigabit Ethernet and
regular old 5.1 audio packaging is
pretty bare-bones - you get kind of a
Quick Start Guide Chinese only an i/o
shield and a SATA cable the funny thing
is that IO shield if you look at it the
Ethernet port is optional maybe they did
that for grounding purposes so you
this activation well you know what what
do we do see what it can do yeah
basically the reason they have this down
here it's got an 8700 kne right now okay
I'm a little bit weary of putting in
8700 K into that but yeah that's the
fire ups in a bench see what it looks
like and then we'll finally put the 8700
K into that and see what it's like with
ddr3 if it even works we'll be answering
the question once and for all that
nobody ever had how well would an 8700 K
perform if it was limited to ddr3 so
we're using csgo as a benchmark because
it's easily CPU bottlenecked which is
going to tell us then with all the other
hardware being the same if our CPU has
its performance hindered in some way
either by the motherboard or by our
memory check this SH is out there's four
jumpers here so you can select either
SATA or PCIe wait those support PCI you
know I don't think so
I think these just allocate the lanes o
or something for forty seven point two
three and for our final trick here we're
gonna run the v-ray benchmark then it's
time to actually install Hardware on
this thing it's kind of terrifying
alright we're done so let's go ahead and
let's do this thing so a lot of you
probably don't realize this but there's
a very good reason that Intel's eighth
generation CPUs still have support for
ddr3 and that's mobile a lot of laptops
actually still ship with lpddr3 because
the low-power ddr4 at least this is my
understanding just did it ever get up to
snuff I kind of feel like no like ddr4
itself is pretty low power so there's
that if that's the case though then we
need to make sure that we don't enable
XMP on this why are these on so tight
did you rinse them in I use the
screwdriver I never actually did inspect
that board for bent pins but it looks
like it's fine from here yeah let's find
me
that looks hilarious yeah there's enough
there's enough mounting holes it's all
good
sure here comes our CPU cooler oh man oh
they don't have a right angle they don't
feels like the mothership like
descending on the unsuspecting populace
Wow do they even have oh yeah we've got
one fan header
ah two fan header let's put it hey hey
hey there we go right you ready sure
now we're gonna have to jump that thing
okay so so far it's not posting we
expect this have you tried this no this
is the first time this board has been
booted is it possible it's outputting to
the on board because it does you plugged
into the wrong HDMI cable come on baby
hey well we didn't even get it oh oh
AMD Rison and master driver dot assists
there's our problem oh yeah okay we can
get into safe mode and kill that our
8700 K is there and V V configuration
day wow it does have a meaning eight
gigs ddr3 suckas and we could even set
it to something else if we wanted but
we're gonna leave it default for now
okay so let's go ahead and save our
configuration exit let's get that I'm
about to drive in there oh yeah oh wait
that would how difficult is it to
extract from this just two screws oh
yeah you know I like to do it all right
a minor glitch Oh would help we plug the
GPU in yeah now I'm not the only one
yeah one thing I'll give this board is
that it gets into the BIOS real quick no
enemy device time okay but what we don't
know is if changing those jumpers will
fix it how much was this motherboard
anyway it was like fifty five dollars so
it wasn't even that cheap no well that
sucks yeah that's that's $55 not getting
back thanks Anthony I had not realized
that yet and until this moment
I mean it's past the return date we've
been hanging out of this board yes Thank
You Anthony mm-hmm
okay so I've changed them all over to
PCIe just to see what happens like does
that actually take like four individual
PCIe lanes and allocate them to SATA is
that what we just did I don't get it
we just booted to our SATA Drive when I
just theoretically disabled every SATA
port on the board it could be that you
were just individually splicing the
lanes over I thought doesn't make sense
to me hey dang this thing's pretty cool
if it wasn't 50 bucks well all right
let's get it booted okay so this is it
we are looking at a desktop mm-hmm 8th
gen CPU ddr3 we need a driver for our
network controller here boom well that
didn't take much this is nuts
it's nuts I tell ya yeah why don't you
just fire up CPU Z or task manager we're
turbo Eng so the CPU is behaving as it
normally would
6 cores 12 threads oh we got our driver
we are ready to run benchmarks that was
quick
yeah Cinebench now do you have an older
chip for us to try in this thing yeah
that's a 7700 K right there
heck yeah all right cool which
theoretically should not work in a
3-series chipset theoretically cool oh
that's
ouch mmm you know it's funny because
back in the ddr3 days
did some testing and determined that the
memory speed of your ddr3 didn't make
that much of a difference but like I
guess CPUs have gotten faster I mean to
be fair it's probably running at 1066
it's running 33 yes csgo time
what's csgo ha ha how zero focus motor
there how's your control of it well what
if I was in here boom what if I was out
here sorry I'm just not being very
helpful right now actually oh you can
cut wow that is something what are we
gonna read forty five point one two I
feel like we have to go in try to run
the RAM at stalk speed at least give it
sort of enter it and go and see what
happens and then run these again cuz we
can't I mean we can't accept that what
do you want to run it at what do you
think's fare 1600 or 1866 would have
been 1866 then yeah will it post looks
like it yeah Wow hey there we go okay
alright what's in a bench yeah let's
Cinebench it I want the local result you
worthless piece of garbage and the
stupid thing is it's not even like it's
filtering out exe s or something it it's
like there's all these files that have
the word Cinebench in them see how it
comes up Windows is good wow that did
not improve much no 1258 was our last
run 12:54 I'm not even gonna bother
running the rest of the benchmarks
clearly that didn't help so the only
thing left to do now is to put the 7700
K in and see if that actually works the
only thing left to do now is to find out
if Intel lied means what you're trying
to say alright
CPU me out comes the 8700 k so this is
the officially supported chip
and in goes a 7700 K who can we trust
Intel or the weird Chinese motherboard
manufacturer we've never heard of all
right let's reset it then
ah here it goes huh so check this out
7700 K yeah it went back to 1333 you're
right
ddr3 memory and H 310 chipset so was it
possible then for Intel to give
backwards compatibility to their 300
series motherboards the empirical
evidence would suggest that yes yes in
fact they could have done that but as
for whether they could have made the
older ones forwards compatible well
there's a lot of conflicting evidence
there there are people who have gotten
100 and 200 series chipsets working with
8th gen chips like this one but we have
no way of knowing what the longevity of
the motherboard and or the CPU would
have been so we don't know even if it
could have worked whether it would have
passed Intel's
quality control standards in the
meantime you said there was a special
surprise for me in this video yes as it
turns out they released a BIOS update
and that BIOS update adds another number
to the list of supported CPUs and that
number is 9 we can go all the way to 8
cores on this thing mm-hmm do we really
want to put our 9900 K in here either
it'll work and it'll be all amazing or
there'll be a fire so this is it moment
of truth the latest bios is on so you
mentioned different revisions of this
motherboard yeah there's a 1.0 2.0 and
3.0 this is the 1.0 I probably spoke a
little bit too soon on that one the 3.0
does support the 8th gen or 9th Jana
well either way I'm impressed andhe made
the first motherboard that I've seen in
over 10 years that supports more than
two generations of intel chips and even
though I don't think it's an amazing
deal especially because you're giving up
so much of your performance on
newer processors thanks to its ddr3
limitation it's a cool piece of tech and
you should you should watch this video
about it JK you already did haha
speaking of watching the whole video
this message from our sponsor thermal
take the thermal take a 500 aluminium
mid-tower has a minimalistic design with
brushed aluminum for a clean
uninterrupted look it's got hinge
tempered glass panels on both sides
it fits radiators up to 420 millimeters
on the front and it's got up to four two
and a half or three and a half inch hard
drive mounts on the left side panel or
on top of the power supply cover it's
got a USB type-c port and you can get it
for yourself at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
