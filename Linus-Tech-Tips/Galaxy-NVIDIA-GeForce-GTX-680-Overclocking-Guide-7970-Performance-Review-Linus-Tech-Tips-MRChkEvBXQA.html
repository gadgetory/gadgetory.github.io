680 is to my understanding fairly oval
over the Abuna overclockable but I
haven't seen any numbers yet so I'm
going to be using a retail sample so
this is probably going to be the only
review that's up on launch day of the
GTX 680 using a retail non hand-picked
board and we're gonna see how far it
goes and how well it can compare in
terms of performance to be highly
overclockable HD 7970 from AMD so i've
already got a lot of my numbers prepared
here i have my stock speed 680 results i
have my stock speed 7970 results then I
have my 680 OC results still to fill in
because I have not yet begun
overclocking and then I've got my 7970
OC results which are based on basically
maxing out the overclocking within the
catalyst control center so we were
running at oh shoot what was it just
right 1.125 gigahertz on the processor
and then 6.3 gigahertz on the memory so
this is one freaking fast card and I am
very very excited to see what we can get
out of its main competitor the GTX 680
here you go yeah I'll be having a break
so guys I'll be having a look at not
only the performance but also the
difference in power consumption from
overclocking these cards so you can see
there was definitely an increase and
increase increase from the stock power
consumption to the overclocked power
consumption I'll also be looking at how
temperatures are affected because I've
got all of my baseline readings done so
stay tuned guys we are going to be using
EVGA precision which at launch is the
only overclocking application to support
the 680 I'm more of an MSI Afterburner
guy myself I love there oh yeah see it's
not gonna work I love their simple
interface and I'm just very used to it I
like the way they do their graphs but
since precision is what we're using
precision
is what I will have to figure out how to
how to work so stay tuned guys let's see
how this goes well I guess we better do
a basic rundown of precision X first so
number one is that it has integrated
voltage adjustments for the GPU so you
can actually slide these to where you
want them to go do you you can press set
I'm not going to be changing any
voltages I did not change voltages on
the 7970 so I will not be adjusting
voltages on the gtx 680 for the sake of
this basic overclocking guide you guys
want to turn up voltages on your CPUs be
careful in terms of your cooling be
careful not to fry your GPU because it
is a very expensive mistake to make and
while yes
turning up voltages may not affect it in
any way this is a new graphics card on a
new manufacturing process there are no
guarantees that it won't break your card
whether it's today or tomorrow or two
months from now so maybe let someone
else be the guinea pig okay so we've got
a performance log frame rate target
which is this kind of neat thing right
here we can enable this to set a target
FPS which is interesting because it
seems to be related to the fact that the
GTX 680 dynamically scales its power
consumption which is probably here
somewhere
okay don't see it but it scales its
power consumption with its GPU clocks in
order to achieve the optimal heat output
as well to stay within the the power
target and heat target that was designed
for so in order to get any serious
overclocking done you're probably going
to want to adjust your power target so
I'm going to go ahead and tell it pretty
much I don't care what kind of power
target you reach as long as we're not
turning up any voltage okay so that's
one thing we've also got monitoring of
temperature monitoring if SP this is
cool you can use this software to set up
a fan curve I love fan curves I think
they're amazing I think giving users the
control to say okay yeah I'm comfortable
you know with really low fan speeds up
to 70 degrees 78 degrees and then I want
it to ramp right up to 100% get it
cooled back down if you want it to work
that way you can totally make it work
that way so I'm turning voltages a hot
GPU clock offset so let's talk about GPU
boost so the
basic clock here so that's at about one
gigahertz 1006 megahertz or something
like that and then the boost clock at
10:56 or something along those lines
those are both clock speeds of your GPU
so you can well you can set an offset so
what that means is the offset until it
detects that it has extra TDP room extra
power room in order to boost itself up
from the offset that you've said so for
example if I set the offset at 100
megahertz and I know this GPU is
probably gonna be good for 100 megahertz
otherwise I wouldn't set that you should
probably only go up in increments of
like you know 15 to 25 go ahead and
apply that you can see those dials are
hopefully going to move in some way or
unless that's just showing the the base
default one okay cool interesting maybe
we'll just get started and see how this
goes okay but either way that's how
offsets are supposed to work so as it
needs more power it can boost itself up
and you're just setting up what the base
GPU clock will be in it'll boost from
there that's sort of the point okay guys
so I see how this works now while I
don't recommend using fir mark for any
kind of extended period of time it's
been handy for me for this because it's
allowed me to examine how the here with
the performance log I can see the
percentage of power that the board is
using please focus there we go
compared to see we've had 132 which is
the maximum I was able to set for the
power target compared to what the GPU
clock is actually running at so 1145 is
what we seem to be peaking at which is
actually I 11 72 is our 100% peak so
that's we should be somewhere in the
neighborhood of 106 plus 153 so what is
that at 1006 + 153 so 1161 something
like that so yeah you can see where
we're popping up there once in a while
but not staying there consistently so
I'll have to look at how performance is
actually affected but it looks like the
way the overclocking works at least with
precision is that we are pretty much
just
overclocking the boost clock and I don't
see a way to adjust the base clock
although because yeah obviously I can't
find any manual or instructions for this
right now but if I turns out that I'm
wrong then I apologize and guys please
leave a comment and let me know but
there we have it so let's see what kind
of a performance improvement we get by
increasing the turbo GPU boost clock
offset on the GTX 680 well I can see
this causing some confusion so due to
the way GPU boosts works where it turns
up the GPU clock if it has the available
power Headroom if you turn the
overclocking the offset up past where
it's capable of throttling - it looks
like performance does not continue to
scale so you can see we have a score of
31 67 so I'm gonna go back to my
spreadsheet now when I was at 153 offset
we were able to score 34 88 on the
extreme preset in 3d mark Levin however
what you guys will see is 31 72 so this
is almost exactly the same as what I got
with my stock configuration on the GTX
680 so it looks like once we turn it up
past the threshold it doesn't
necessarily scale 100% correctly now
this is an early beta version of
precision X and like I said I have no
instructions so I'm not even 100% sure
if I'm doing it right but I'm gonna put
it back at the setting I had before and
run it one more time to see if I can get
my overclocked setting dialed in here so
now we've seen even higher score so this
is at plus 153 so you can see we're
getting about 12 50 megahertz when the
benchmarks are actually running and
we're seeing about a 100 102 119 now 126
so we're seeing pretty close to the
power threshold that that we've said
over here in some strenuous situations
so let's do some real-world benchmarking
and find out how this GPU boost
overclocking actually works now I would
really prefer if they made some tweaks
to the to the interface here allowing
you to boost up this base clock rather
than only the boost clock so that you
have at least some idea of a baseline
that you're running at without it doing
any
like funky scaling back and forth but
maybe that's something we'll see in a
future revision hard to say let's check
out the real world performance so this
is weird check this out guys so with the
overclocked settings running on the gtx
680 I'm not getting that weird
flickering that I was getting in Skyrim
with it at stock speeds so um yeah I
don't know what to say it seems to have
kind of healed itself anyway I'm just
finishing up my overclocked settings
benchmarking and I'll be done shortly
so in conclusion even after overclocking
both of the cards the GTX 680 is still
the winner and once I get the hang of
overclocking it it might actually be a
winner by more substantial margin so I
have a game running in the background so
this shows what my final overclocked
ended up being 145 this was stable in
all of my games you can see the
fluctuations in the clock speed as well
as the fluctuations in the peak power
consumption according to the power
target up here so I mean yeah I think
there's probably still some refinement
to be done to the precision X tool or
whatever other tools end up becoming
popular with these cards but let's talk
results for a little bit here so idol
power is up about 10 watts versus the
stock clocked card and then idle temps
are around the same 3d mark 11 we saw up
to 35 72 3d marks although at the same
clock speeds we saw scores of about a
hundred marks lower even so there seems
to be some inconsistency in the scores
although we saw fairly consistent
improvements across the board actually
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
hide all this other stuff so we saw
fairly consistent improvements across
the board so here is the so we saw about
a seven eight percent improvement in
battlefield 3 then in Crysis 2 we saw
yeah very little there so about a four
percent improvement three and a half
percent improvement something along
those lines
Witcher 2 we see about a you know eight
percent improvement
something along those lines or like six
or whatever that works out to power
comes on
is a little bit higher across-the-board
using the same methodology I was using
in my original performance review to
measure that see this is weird dirt3
actually went down a little bit in terms
of average frame rate although power
consumption went up substantially Batman
Arkham City is up significantly I'm
probably gonna have to rerun these
numbers and I'll do an annotation on my
original review video if there's
anything afoul about them because you
can see that power consumption number is
low that could also have to do with GPU
boost scaling back the power and scaling
back the performance skyrim we see
nvidia is definitely the king here and
we see a very moderate performance
improvement in skyrim that is what i
would consider to be within the margin
of error for this test so we didn't see
much of a performance boost there
however it is still good enough to beat
the Radeon 7970 overclock so there you
have it guys
my GTX 680 let's call this preliminary
overclocking video because I don't think
we can call these results final but this
is what I've got ready for launch and
hopefully I'll be able to do a follow-up
at some point let you guys know if there
are any changes to my overclocking
methodology with this card don't forget

unboxings reviews and other competing
computer videos and don't forget how
dedicated I am to you guys here Here I
am finishing up my benchmarks and I'm
probably not done for the night yet so
