the type cover for the Microsoft Surface
this is the English layout and it comes
in a box that says it's designed for
surface Windows RT and Windows 8 pro ok
awesome and that's pretty much all the
information there is on the outside so
I'm gonna treat this as a bit of a
comparison between the surface type
cover and the surface touch cover you
can see the touch cover is installed on
the surface that's behind the packaging
right here I love Microsoft's packaging
for the surface line of products overall
they've sort of taken a couple cues from
from companies that do packaging well
and implemented them not to sort of you
know want anyone to run crying fouls in
here we've got a little bit of
documentation that covers kind of not a
whole lot of information that could
matter that much it should be pretty
straightforward this is the type cover
so what is the difference between the
type cover and the touch cover they both
attach to the surface using this
magnetic and proprietary keyboard
interface here Microsoft is allowing
third parties to use this interface if
they pay a licensing fee so that way
Microsoft takes a little bit more margin
out of it and other companies will be
able to contribute their there additions
to what they see is a vision for how it
should work so the difference is this is
pressure-sensitive so you press a button
by like pressing a button there's no
tactile feedback this is a very
low-profile keyboard you can see that in
actual thickness like in real terms
they're not that different the the touch
are the type what is it called
that's good tight cover is not that much
thicker than the touch cover and both of
them are like significantly thinner than
something like see an iPhone my usual
iPhone thickness comparison very very
closely would it help if I turn these on
edge for you so you can see them a
little bit better very very close now
the overall feel of them is
on this side where they have like kind
of a dense sort of fabric cover that
should be pretty durable it doesn't feel
like it's going anywhere and then this
one has kind of a almost like a
microfiber each sort of cloth II feel to
the inside whereas this one is just a
keyboard now the keys are ever so
slightly recessed around an edge of sort
of a more rubberized softer feeling
material here so that you're not going
to end up scratching the screen and
they're actual travel is all things
considered there's a little bit of
movement to the keys you see I can move
them back and forth a little bit so
because of the low profile construction
there's only so much they can do to make
it like the most rugged rage proof
keyboard ever the layouts are very
similar so there's not a whole lot of
differences there at all and they use
that they both use an acceptable layout
there's layout sort of cardinal sins
that drive me crazy and neither of them
do but one thing that I'd say is gonna
be a huge improvement improvement
besides the obvious typing experience is
the fact that the touchpad is a proper
touchpad with a hard surface I did
notice that with the with the touch
cover this is a little bit harder to use
than I'm that I'm used to with a
touchpad because this felty material
makes very small precise movements not
as easy as they would otherwise be so to
attach it to the surface is very
straightforward all you do is kind of
somewhat remotely align them up align
them up line them up align them and it's
a very very strong bond that finds its
way into the right place sort of almost
no matter what you do except the one
time when I'm yeah there you go so you
don't really have to do a whole lot of
adjustments the kickstand is awesome now
from my users perspective it almost
feels like I'm using this more like a
notebook than like a tablet except that
I can sort of put my fingers all over my
screen if I wanted and enjoy my computer
use that way so let's just go ahead and
well I mean all the usual Windows
features are here so you've got arrow
snap which I think they call modern snap
or something I don't know what they're
calling it but so let's have a look and
see how typing is on this I did try out
the touch already how are you today
sir this is a much better experience
than the touch it's a touch cover the
tactile feedback is most reassuring sir
so without any practice is my first time
I'm actually able to type on this thing
whereas with the touch cover it will
take some getting used to
it's very quiet unless you're really
mashing on it with the exception of the
backspace backspace has a bit of a sound
to it spacebar has a bit of a sound
these keys are all very quiet I think
that's pretty much it I mean we can
compare how it how it affects the
overall profile of the surface the
surface is still a pretty acceptable
profile if you consider more like a
notebook form factor and if you consider
it less like a tablet at this point and
more like a super duper ultra portable
notebook that can then have its keyboard
removed very easily and be used as a
100% tablet you signed in just like that
and I think that pretty much covers it
not much else to say thank you for
checking on my unboxing and first look
at the type cover for the Microsoft
Surface don't forget to subscribe to
