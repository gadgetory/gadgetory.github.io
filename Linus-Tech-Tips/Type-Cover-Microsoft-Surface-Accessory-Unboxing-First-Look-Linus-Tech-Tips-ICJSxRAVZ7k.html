the type cover for the Microsoft Surface
this is the English layout and it comes
in a box that says it's designed for
surface windows RT and Windows 8 pro
okay awesome and that's pretty much all
the information there's on the outside
so I'm going to treat this as a bit of a
comparison between the surface type
cover and the surface touch cover you
can see the touch cover is installed on
the surface that's behind the packaging
right here I love Microsoft's packaging
for the surface line of products overall
they've sort of taken a couple cues from
from companies that do packaging well
and implemented them not to sort of you
know want anyone to run crying foul
about Microsoft puppy the packaging idea
whatever else in here we've got a little
bit of documentation that covers kind of
not a whole lot of information that
could matter that much it should be
pretty straightforward this is the type
cover so what is the difference between
the type cover and the touch cover they
both attached to the surface using this
magnetic and proprietary keyboard
interface here Microsoft is allowing
third parties to use this interface if
they pay a licensing fee so that way
Microsoft takes a little bit more margin
out of it and other companies will be
able to contribute their bare additions
to what they see is a vision for how it
should work so the difference is this is
pressure sensitive so you press a button
by like pressing a button there's no
tactile feedback this is a very low
profile keyboard you can see that in
actual thickness like in real terms
they're not that different the the touch
are the type what is it called that hmm
type cover is not that much thicker than
the touch cover and both of them are
like significantly thinner than
something like see an iphone my usual
iPhone thickness comparison very very
closely would it help if I turn these on
edge for you so you can see them a
little bit better very very close now
the overall feel of them is
we're on this side where they have like
kind of a dense sort of fabric cover
that should be pretty durable it doesn't
feel like it's going anywhere and then
this one has kind of a almost like a
microfiber II sort of coffee feel to the
inside whereas this one is just a
keyboard now the keys are ever so
slightly recessed around an edge of sort
of a more rubberized softer feeling
material here so that you're not going
to end up scratching the screen and
their actual travel is what that bad all
things considered there's a little bit
of movement to the keys you see I can
move them back and forth a little bit so
because of the low profile construction
there's only so much they can do to make
it like the most rugged rage proof
keyboard ever the layouts are very
similar so there's not a whole lot of
differences there at all and they use
that they both use an acceptable layout
there's layout sort of cardinal sins
that drive me crazy and neither of them
do but one thing that I'd say is going
to be a huge improvement improvement
besides the obvious typing experience is
the fact that the touchpad is a proper
touchpad with a hard surface I did
notice that with the with the touch
cover this is a little bit harder to use
than I'm that I'm used to with a touch
pad because this felting material makes
very small precise movements not as easy
as they would otherwise be so to attach
it to the surface is very
straightforward all you do is kind of
somewhat remotely I'll line them up I
line them up line them up align them and
it's a very very strong bond that finds
its way into the right place sort of
almost no matter what you do except the
one time when I'm yeah see there you go
so you don't really have to do a whole
lot of adjustments the kickstand is
awesome now from my users perspective it
almost feels like I'm using this more
like a notebook than like a tablet
except that I can sort of put my fingers
all over my screen if I wanted and enjoy
my computer use that way so let's just
go ahead and well I mean all the usual
windows features are here so you've got
arrow snap which i think they call
modern snap or something i don't know
what to call
but so let's have a look and see how
typing is on this I did try out the
touch already how are you today sir this
is a much better experience than the
touch what's a touch cover the tactile
feedback is most reassuring sir so
without any practice is my first time
I'm actually able to type on this thing
whereas with the touch cover it will
take some getting used to it's very
quiet unless you're really mashing on it
with the exception of the backspace
backspace has a bit of a sound to it
spacebar has a bit of a sound these keys
are all very quiet I think that's pretty
much it I mean we can compare how it how
it affects the overall profile of the
surface the surface is still a pretty
acceptable profile if you consider more
like a notebook form factor and if you
consider it let's like a tablet at this
point and more like a super duper ultra
portable notebook that can then have its
keyboard removed very easily and be used
as a one hundred-percent tablet you sign
in just like that and I think that
pretty much covers it not much else to
say thank you for checking on my
unboxing and first look at the type
cover for the Microsoft Surface don't
