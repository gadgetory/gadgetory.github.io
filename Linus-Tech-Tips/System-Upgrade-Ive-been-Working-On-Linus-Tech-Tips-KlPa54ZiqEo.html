rig and I mentioned it in one of my
other videos and someone asked me to do
a blog post on what I'm actually
installing in here and what kind of
changes I'm making so first of all I've
gone with an MSI Big Bang xpower for my
latest build it's a very solid board
comes with a very good accessory package
and just all the features that I really
need lots of PCI Express slots I'm
pretty much done with PCI personally so
that's that's one of the reasons I
decided to go with this board and down
under that Enzo Tec Luna waterblock I've
got a 980 x6 core processor that's 12
gigs of ocz special edition see the blue
and black color scheme which is just
dead sexy on there and so I'll be
running that in the motherboard this is
an msi geforce gtx 480 i've gone with a
single card this time around although I
usually do run SLI and I may change it
later on in the future to add an
additional graphics card I am using a
modular power supply that's an inner max
revolution 85 plus it's an 80 plus
silver power supply so I will have the
option to add more cables and have
another graphics card in the future
should I desire it yes that is a vision
Tech killer Nick it's got a feature I
really like it's got that bandwidth
allocation feature which I find really
cool I like their software overall I've
found that having the killer Nick in my
computer is better than not having the
killer Nick in my computer so I went
ahead and replaced my Intel Nick with it
a while back so let's move back and take
an overall look at the PC this isn't a
silverstone TJ of seven the only
modifications I've really made to it are
a couple holes here and there and I have
painted the interior with a black
wrinkle I had it done by mountain mods a
couple years ago at this point I guess I
am using gelid wing fans up here in the
visible parts of the build and then here
in the front gelid wings again but then
where it's actually hidden i have the
new silverstone air penetrators which
are running the main thermal chill pa1
20.4 radiator that does most of the
cooling in this build all though there
is a black ice 2 pro here in the front
but these fans actually only turn on if
the system gets hot which with a single
graphics card in it is very unlikely for
the liquid cooling system to actually
heat up speaking of the liquid cooling
system here's an EKG TX 480
nickel-plated plexi block so that's
going to go on the 480 once I've
finished doing some burnin and testing
on this system you can see the back of
the system I'm using noise dampening
mounts for all of the fans where that is
a possibility this build is all about
silence this liquid cooling system is
not for performance all of these fans
will be run at much less than full
voltage at all times thanks to this guy
right here this is the brains of the
operation so it's got a couple of
temperature sensors one of which gets
attached to the side of my main radiator
and the other one sits around the here
there it is right there sits in the
Northbridge so basically I use those as
a reference points for how hot is my
liquid cooling system how hot are the
air cooled components in my rig and then
I adjust the fan speeds in zones so
these two and these two are actually
adjusted together and I use the 92 s
first because at low rpm where I don't
need a lot of cooling they're actually a
little bit quieter than the 120 s then
the 120 s kick in when things get hot
and the liquid cooling system actually
runs with the fans off on the front and
right around like 30% fan speed on the
bottom ones until things start to get a
little bit warm there's that enter max
revolution yes I realize in the ideal
world I would have this fan turned
around but then I would have to use the
other holes in my power supply now down
here and then I'd like chip the paint
really I have enough radiator in this
rig to cool a couple machines like this
so I'm not too worried about it there's
the air penetrator fans I was talking
about these are going to be a great
addition to this build I just changed
over to these I was using 8 loons down
here before because air penetrators are
designed to actually blow air in a
column directly away from the fan so
what that means is once I close up this
and the mesh is sitting here it should
Maura Fabian this is all in theory it
should in theory more effectively blow
the air through and out the other side
panel rather than just kind of
scattering it around in here and relying
on random chance to blow out the other
side of the computer so that that is my
theory seems like a good theory I hear
some inverters for cold cathodes here's
where I melt my two and a half inch SSD
drives so I'll just run all the SATA
cables here I use this hole right here
to run some SATA power up there so all
the dry and state completely hidden out
of the way I still have some stuff to do
so I still get a mount a pump and some
kind of reservoir down here I haven't
decided how I'm going to do that because
honestly it's a total nightmare to mount
one of these I've got a few MC res
micros here here's a rev - here's a rev
one here's a really old rev one it has
like some kind of gunk on the side of it
and I've also got one of these t-virus
reza's this one leaks though so I
haven't really found a place to to put
it where it would really work like it
doesn't really fit here which is ideally
where I would want to put it so I think
that one's pretty much out of the
question right now yeah this is what the
floor looks like oh yeah I've been
working on sleeping the revolution comes
with just horrendous looking sleeting or
let me look at this enough so I went
ahead and replaced it with plain blacks
leading that I bought from
cableorganizer.com it's cheap it's fast
things get done so yeah that was why I
went that route so you can see all the
cables are now sleeved black I've got
the two EPs eight pins up here I've got
my six pins here my 24 pin I've still
got to do some some SATA cables as well
as a molex cable make sure I've got
power everywhere oh yeah I've got one of
those cool LG blu-ray / HD DVD drives I
know no one cares about HD DVD anymore
but if I ever happen to cross an HD DVD
drive I could our disc I could play it
so there you go it's more than you can
say oh yeah I replaced the the front of
the case the the front drive bay covers
with an Tek 900 ones so now they are
perforated and you
and run an air through them which is
good here in the front I still have the
stock USB firewire audio ping and I have
UV lights yep black lights here here two
of them here one more back here and that
lights up the UV blue primo Flex LRT
tubing as well as the UV sensitive gelid
wing fans and I used to have a dfi LAN
party board so it lit that up as well
but there you go that is the build that
I'm working on and it's been sitting
here for Wow like weeks I wish it worked
because then I would have a computer
again that would be great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
