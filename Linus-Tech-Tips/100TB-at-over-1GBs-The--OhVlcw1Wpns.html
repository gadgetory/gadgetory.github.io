I built a 100-plus terabyte storage
server to replace the awful store data
on disconnected drives on a shelf in the
bathroom system that we were rocking
before thank Seagate for the awesome
drives and thanks 45 drives comm for the
rock and personalized tornado server but
some of you may have noticed that I
never followed up on the performance
testing that I promised to do on that
machine I was supposed to be showing off
one gigabyte per second transfers with
the 10 gigabit network set up what gives
well today we finally get the whole
story
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so the short
version is this in spite of 45 drives
telling me that they had customers with
similar config saturating a 10 gigabit
link or more I couldn't even get half of
that and it made no sense really I did a
lot of tinkering with this box before
eventually deploying it different
network cards different drive
configurations and finally got to the
point where it was whether freenas
hardware or petcock I had to roll it out
because we needed to put our data
somewhere and I was just gonna have to
live with the results that I got I mean
I know I know
poor Linus only has 300 to 350 megabyte
per second speeds to is over 100
terabytes of safe storage boohoo but
this disrupted my plans for our storage
infrastructure in a bigger way than you
might think in addition to archiving old
stuff to the server my intention was to
have our daily use Ness the SSD one that
you probably remember from this video
doing nightly syncs or even hourly
checkpoints if we could get away with it
so we'd have two full copies of all of
our mission-critical data so I wanted
the magnetic Nazz to be fast enough to
handle that and any random data that our
editors needed to read from it from old
projects which we were not able to do so
while I've had four months to diagnose
this and ponder what could be wrong
because it's had up to 60 terabytes of
important data on it with nowhere else
to offload that I've had no choice but
to just limp along at 300 to 350
megabytes per second until today
seagate sent us 35 of their new 8
terabyte enterprise capacity drives and
no these are not the shingled platter
archival ones these are rock and ass
capable of well in excess of 200
megabytes per second transfer speeds
rated at 2 million hours mean time
between failure and with a five-year
warranty to back it up proper enterprise
capacity drives so I immediately tore
them out of their packaging and began
building pyramids that no just kidding
ok I did build pyramids but but when I
actually built with them after the
pyramids was 2 additional servers each
to hold a copy of our 60 terabytes of
data while I worked on the vault so one
of those machines is actually eventually
going to be an AZ unit at my house and
the other one is going to be an off-site
backup server for this puppy but each of
those will get their own videos later so
with the data safely stored on a
hardware raid 6 and on a software butter
FS raid 5 each of those transfers took
over a day by the way I wiped the
freeness and began trying things so
first I tried 6 drive v des since that's
a more optimal number for ZFS - nope
still shoddy transfer speeds next I
tried 10 Drive V dads no difference
again finally in desperation I tried a
27 drive raid 0 an experimental class
configuration that no one should trust
to hold any data no matter how amazing
the drives are and same thing which
after talking to the folks at 45 drives
about my findings revealed that the
issue is probably a software one because
they've seen NFS shares just fly in a
similar configuration to mine which
doesn't do me any good because this is a
Windows environment and we need SMB
shares and so I had to keep
investigating because if I'm going to be
running around saying this nas unit in
these drives are capable with over a
gigabyte per second of transfer speed we
use them here at Linus Media Group I
mean I'm basically endorsing the things
it's not good enough to me
445 drives to
see it in their lab I need to see it so
I've been chatting a lot with the unread
guys ever since they helped us do the to
gamers one CPU project which you should
definitely check out if you haven't
already and they offered to spend some
time configuring an experimental raid
five butter FS array in on raid and
tuning both the network settings as well
as the SMB share settings so while we're
initial tests on a vanilla on raid
server was frankly pretty ho-hum
actually fairly similar there's that
poor SMB optimization outside of Windows
platforms rearing its ugly head again
some four kilobyte packet and jumbo
frame tuning to the network card tuning
of on raids networking configuration and
boom that my friends is the cleanest ten
gigabit transfer that I've actually ever
seen now a lot of lime Tech's customers
are running ten Giggy but from their
perspective I guess it's just valuable
R&amp;amp;D for down the road when that gear
becomes more common but I mean even then
this is not the kind of config that most
people will encounter even on unrated I
actually don't intend to continue to run
it like this but RFS raid 5 and raid 6
are both in the experimental stage but
the good news here is that what I
realized after running the slow FreeNAS
configuration for so long was that
generally speaking I don't need more
than the 200 to 220 megabyte per second
transfer speeds that my individual
drives are capable of in a normal unread
array and that the only thing that needs
to be lightning-fast performance wise is
the new footage and projects that we
offload to it relatively little of which
is created on a daily basis so we
devised a new plan and to help us
realize the new plan Kingston stepped up
and offered to send us eight of their a
50 enterprise-grade 480 gig SSDs with
power loss protection these drives will
act as a 2 terabyte raid 10 right cache
that will be capable of the full 10
gigabit transfer rate for fast up
dates throughout the day and that then
flushes nightly to the hard drives when
no one is using them all of this can be
completely transparent to the user so
the only time we'll ever see sub one
gigabyte per second transfers is when
we're accessing cold data we're when
doing a massive dump of over two
terabytes at a time another cool side
note is that this might turn out to be a
better way to leverage the extra
horsepower that this OPC server is
leaving on the table anyway because she
never touches more than about 20% CPU
usage so I could take a couple of cores
and turn them into a network rendering
box or game server or something else and
on the subject then of our server being
OPI I guess that brings us to the
conclusion it turns out that the
hardware is but SMB shares on non
Windows platforms takes some tuning and
optimization that if you're willing to
endure the dense documentation and
condescending attitude of the FreeNAS
community you could probably achieve
there but instead I ended up working
directly with lime tech to have baked
into an upcoming release of unmade six
and I'm super happy with the new config
