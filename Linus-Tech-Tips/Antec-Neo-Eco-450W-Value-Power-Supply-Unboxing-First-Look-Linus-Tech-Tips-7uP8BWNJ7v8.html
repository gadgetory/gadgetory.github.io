product that you probably won't see on a
shelf anywhere anytime soon so this is
the antic Neo echo 450 seat
it provides 450 watts of continuous
power remember all Antec power supplies
are rated by continuous power not peak
power like some cheaper units it is an
80 plus certified power supply and it
comes in a very environmentally friendly
looking box got flowers on it they do
not include a power cord because my NX
line of reasoning the power cord is just
adding unnecessary cost and unnecessary
waste to the product as most computer
users probably have one lying around
which is true in a lot of cases also if
you don't have a power cord it's like a
two-dollar adder to buy one at NCIX
anyway so it's not not a bad idea okay
by reusing your existing cord you can
reduce waste no protects the environment
okay but there's what else do we got on
here so dual and quad core ready I
should certainly hope so
EPS 12 volt as well as ATX 12 volt 2.30
K active PFC single 12 volt rail on this
450 watt power supply five SATA
connectors and industrial grade
protection so for things like
overcurrent over-voltage all of that
kind of stuff here's our overall specs
so the output is 450 watt so we can
actually output 408 watts of that on the
12 volt rail so does a 34 amp 12 volt
rail that's important to know if you're
looking at a video card and you want to
find out if this power supply will be
adequate for powering it I think that's
pretty much it for what I want to show
you guys on the front here so why don't
we start opening up this box and see
what's the deal in the impact oh no I
would normally call it an eel eco
because to me that's what that's what
that word means but everyone from an
tech keeps calling it neo echo to me so
I'm like okay well I guess I better
pronounce it their way
alright inside we find first of all a
product description get economical power
today well that's probably why it's echo
because it's economical not eco system
or ecology so that's why it's a neo echo
alright so the new echo series antics
high-efficiency power supply solution ad
plus certification quiet double ball
bearing 120 millimeter fan this is a
really nice thing to see on an on a
value power supply for man tech because
they've typically gone with the 80 mil
80 mil cooling fan on they're more value
oriented products so that's really good
this product everyone's provide general
information which this unboxing will
also probably provide general
information so we're not gonna worry too
much about that right now
and attack.com slash survey apparently
you can win prizes for telling us what
you think neato
okay we've got more environmentally
friendly packaging so you can see it
does not come with any foam inside it
uses only this recyclable cardboard
stuff we've got four screws for
installing it into your case and a paper
sleeve to prevent it from being
scratched or anything bad like that from
happening okay there's some of that
packing material to protect it during
transit more packing material power
supply itself alright so why don't we
start with let's start with cables today
so let's have a look at what the neo
echo has in terms of cables
oh these are nice long cables actually
for a value unit look at this so here's
our 24-pin connector okay it uses a
detachable four pin although it's semi
attached by default although you can
tear it off if you don't need it so
that's that's my preferred way of doing
this because it means that it is
connected at all times and you don't
have to worry about like do I have it
aligned just right when I'm plugging it
in but you can break it off if you so
desire so that's kind of neat and it's a
nice long cord so this should be just
fine with for a bottom mounted power
supply which is one of those concerns
whenever you're not spending a fortune
on a power supply and you want something
that you're going to be sure is going to
reach to the top of your case that's
something to be aware of it has a 4 + 4
pin connector for the CPU we have a say
little PCIe connector so that means that
you're not going to be running any high
power graphics cards off this particular
unit so you're going to be limited to
something like a gtx 550 ti at the top
end with a single PCIe power connector
okay next we have one harness full of oh
wait hold on how does this work okay
give me a sec no we have o uses the mix
card okay so we have one harness that is
purely molex so three molex and one
floppy and that's a nice long cable as
well and you can see the height is
approximately 1.3 Lynas arms okay and
then we have a mixed one which has 2
SATA and one molex so that would be
perfect to run up to maybe your optical
drive bays where maybe you got one SATA
optical and you've got an older ide one
and you want to use both of those
connectors and then finally we have a
peer SATA one which is also quite long
although not quite as long as that pure
molex one and that has three more SATA
connectors on it so total for molex one
floppy 5 2 SATA 1 4+4 one 6 pin PCI e
and a 24-pin ATX connector now let's
have a look at the unit itself this is
AC model which means it does not have a
modular interface all of the cables are
permanently attached move around to the
side and it's got just a sort of a dark
mid medium gray finish it is painted so
that means that you don't have that ugly
horrible unfinished look to it it would
look at home pretty much anywhere you
can see all the branding is going to
look right side up regardless of which
way you install it in your case see like
that you've got to your general specs
here again all of your safety and
certifications and whatnot are all here
as well on the bottom as mentioned
before it does use a 120 millimeter fan
and I've an Tech's previous products or
anything to go by it's probably a very
high quality double ball bearing fan
next here on the back we've got typical
Antec looking ventilation they don't use
a honeycomb style like a lot of the
other guys do they use this more more
square style first time I saw this was
on the Neo power I believe
so that's pretty much it for that so
