only I only went offline like 15 minutes
ago I was I I showed up at the office
Oh and checked my phone and saw that you
just went live and was like what what is
why you're gonna start early or or the
ranch is gonna be it starting at like
8:00
no no so I just you know what do you
even do I so okay it's very long you
know what actually I said hey Alex are
you still over there no is anyone over
there Jake who Jake
hey Jake can you uh can you actually
grab the network switch from the camera
done oh I've seen this that's really
cool that's got to be extremely
unnecessary oh yeah it was just for fun
yeah okay yeah yeah I was like how did
you possibly have that okay so we were
working on one of the coolest projects
that we've done in a really really long
time and it went way over time and way
over budget and basically it cost us our
goal this week was seven LTG videos
because we're trying to queue up some
extra for me to go on vacation okay um
so our goal was seven LTT videos we
ended up with four because we were very
busy doing this project and it was more
complicated than we hoped and or
expected but the end result is so cool
and the reason that we did it was
ultimately on my Harrison spectacular
Lee guys today whoever did it is not oh
my god it's not because we had to but
rather I know I'm doing it okay okay I'm
kind of I'm kind of I'm concealing it a
little bit yeah but because we wanted to
get some practice creating custom water
cooling solutions because we want to
ultimately water cool already
Canada and we figured let's start on
something a little bit smaller and the
purpose of starting on this on networks
which is a single board I thought you
made it so much taller okay so a
networks which is a single board so it
was it was a matter of just working on
like one flat surface so taking the
measurements was quite a bit easier yeah
it actually does have a function like
the reason that we did it this way was
because we wanted to quiet it down
because it's in the camera den because
for all their ingest stations and card
wiping stations and all that stuff okay
they actually need a high-speed
networking I thought this was going into
the rack so when I saw the increased
height I was like what no this got
pulled from the rack when we got our new
Dell 48 port switches okay so yes yeah
so by the way if anyone from floatplane
is going to come and fix our networking
we know that we don't have a like proper
router right now and all that kind of
stuff for like our new 10 gig connection
I know I just watch it they need to know
that we have two dell 48 port like
managed switches like really nice
switches and we were told that we could
probably use those switches for a lot of
router functionality okay this is
interesting the water is warm well I
wonder if we need a beefier fan on here
oh wow and that's like it's still warm
this thing kicks off more heat than we
probably expected you know the funny
thing is we actually swapped this
radiator out for or we swapped a thicker
one out for this one thinking that we
wouldn't really need that much rad but
remember we might need more radiator
interesting pretty warm yeah that's
that's that's toasty that's fine we can
we can solve just um anyway why it was
key I can interject for a second why
America so this was the tubing scraps
that we had on hand that happened to be
the length that those runs were okay so
no there was no there was no like
America this router this one's a little
hard to see on camera but there's a blue
one right there there's also some
radiators blue - yeah yeah you know no
that wasn't okay
tensional okay but yeah so anyway if
someone from floatplane is planning to
come over just let them know I know AJ
has wanted to help you with networking
stuff for a long time and if and I know
that you know sometimes like VLAN
tagging and stuff doesn't necessarily
cooperate properly between different
vendors so we would want us we would
want if we're going to get a new router
we would want a router that will
cooperate with our Dell so as those we
are we are sticking with okay they were
like a total of eight grand or something
like that for the two of them but like
that's fine because we're talking 96
ports of 10-gig networking six
excuse me twelve ports of 40 gig
networking like that's more than we
could need for quite some time so we're
sticking with that anyway so the purpose
of this was to quiet it down because
it's in a place where people have to
work and this is like a server rack
style switch this is not a this is not a
desktop switch it was quite loud also
you know to practice you know practice
makes perfect and also just cause like
it was fun like I don't not at that I'm
aware of
I don't think anybody has ever done this
before maybe for good reason maybe not
because the project overall was a smash
success like it was a huge success
so we filtered the intakes you can
actually see that you can't really see
through them anymore yeah so I put like
dust filters on all the intakes and then
we're using our fan here as an exhaust
so we're pulling fresh air in through
the sides and exhausting it at the top
cool yeah so all we might have to do is
tune the fan rpm a little bit I was
gonna say you might might be you know
but I bet it's on purpose so the stock
fans are PWM controlled and probably
temperature sensing and we're probably
so far below the temperature threshold
that it's barely turning the bloody
thing okay cuz yeah when we first fired
it up we were seeing anywhere from a 10
to 25 degree reduction in temperature
depending on yeah so you know what I bet
that's it boy it's heavy now here
actually feel this
holy router in it that's a little bit
heavier than you'd expect a switch to be
no I don't like oh I don't know maybe no
no I don't sorry where's that John I fix
the kid here but it's going yeah anyway
so that that project pool a little bit
behind schedule this week but like
honestly you know those are the kinds of
things that are so much fun for us to do
that it's just like if we can't if we
can't do those kinds of things then why
even why even bother anymore honestly
like it's not like techno tainment so
it's a really funny thing because people
often refer to me as a sellout but yeah
I started out making videos for the
money yeah and then over time it's
actually like I had no experience either
behind most people do these days I
anyway look I'm not talking about anyone
else other than myself so over time so I
had no experience in front of or behind
a camera no experience video editing
nada and my boss told me to start a
YouTube channel and then paid me to run
it and over time I've actually grown
into enjoying the creative aspects of it
so I'm actually on sort of this reverse
journey yeah
and it's I just I always kind of get a
kick out of it because like on the one
hand yes just like I always have been I
am running a business here
of course but one of the things I had a
really great conversation I'm not gonna
name their names just cuz like I don't
know sort of how how they would feel
about ways it was better than it was a
one-on-one conversation give someone and
you know they basically said that they
get asked a lot why do you still work
there like you know compared to sort of
you know anything else you could do you
know you could like you could work
anywhere like why do you still work
there exactly and they basically said
well you know I trust the vision
and the vision might not be as artistic
as you know I might desire you know for
myself but the path that I've seen us
follow is build a solid foundation for
the business first which gives you the
time and resources and the team and the
equipment and the facilities that you
need to be an artist and it's like
totally the opposite way that I think
most people go about like a film it's
not a very common it's it's not a very
common direction in in modern times I
guess it's really popular for people to
job hop like crazy right not know it's
popular for people to try to grow things
I think i 100% know what you're talking
about that's actually really cool was I
gonna say yeah I know it it makes sense
I there's a certain line too right like
there's certain things that you don't do
there's certain offers that that liner
shoots down or Nick shoots down or
Colton shoots down most of them didn't
make it to me anymore
take a shot down before you have it
actually like I was why waste their time
bring it to you I'll overhear something
being talked about I'm like that's
ridiculous and they'll be like yeah yeah
we know we're just laughing about it
like no we're not doing that they're
like yeah yeah yeah that's fine yeah
that's cool we know yeah so like and and
it's always a it's always a fine line
yeah and there's like I think one thing
that i SPECT a fair amount is I think
how you've usually taken a stance at it
I'm just shooting in the dark here right
now is if you would hate it as a viewer
yeah you don't do it I've tried not to
do it there are some things honestly
that I've done even though I hate them
as a viewer so something that I haven't
done because I hate them as a viewer is
mid-roll ads in videos yeah so we do our
sponsor spots at the beginning so we do
our hook then we do a 10 to 15 second
spot which the clever among you have
probably noticed that you can
double-click in the YouTube window and
it will skip that
almost perfectly every time just saying
then we do the bulk of our video and
there will be no YouTube TrueView ad
baked in we get a lot of people
criticizing us for oh you guys made it
ten minutes and three seconds for the
money except that if we don't put a
mid-roll ad in it it doesn't do it there
isn't more money yeah so don't actually
understand that they just they just know
the like make it ten minutes for more
money thing so we're not afraid to make
money and then I'm not ashamed to say
that this is a business and that I am
Elsa feed I have literally over two
dozen mouths to feed now that's that's
the way it is but everything that we do
is skippable how'd you get in close to
three with the next hiring wave yeah
we're gonna be close including
floatplane yeah including floatplane
including the nanny including my
children we are well over three dozen by
that point yeah we've talked about this
offline yeah like I've been doing a lot
of soul-searching lately yes I never
wanted this no this was never my
intention you were there yeah we had
conversations early on like this was not
the goal I didn't want to I didn't want
to turn into like an enterprise yeah but
like where we're getting to the point
where it's kind of taking on a life of
its own right now like there are
projects that are underway under this
roof that I have almost or literally
nothing to do with that could
fundamentally change the way that we do
business because as it turns out if you
hire good people they're gonna have
their own ambitions and they're gonna
have their own ideas and their own goals
and I'm gonna be looking at it going
well I mean I don't know if that's
exactly what I would have done but I
can't exactly stop you you have to grow
and you have to learn as both personally
and professionally and if I get in your
way
you're gonna leave
you're really good and I'd really like
you to stay on my team so I guess I need
to find the best way that I can support
this and sure guess we're hiring another
bunch of people it's a good thing
obviously this is a very first rule
problem that I'm not complaining - Media
Group as a business is doing
phenomenally well for those of you
concerned for our well being you know I
actually I actually recently achieved
something that's been a goal of mine for
quite some time now and I feel like I'm
kind of spilling some of your beans here
and I apologize in advance because I'm
not we just can't sit we can't add
details detail that we can't add details
on the previous part yet the previous
part why is this off screen
what should - oh yeah yeah yeah no no I
know no details about any of them no
okay but the goal that I achieved is
back when we were working out of the
Langley House we at our peak there had a
team of its eight or nine people or
something like that anyway so everyone
who joined pretty close to the beginning
within the first couple of years worked
out of that house and as of like two
weeks ago I have officially achieved a
goal that I set for myself
when Linus media group purchased that
that property to run out of and that the
goal was actually to be there forever by
the way yeah I thought five years in
we'd have five or six people and that
would that I'd be really happy with that
we'd all make like so today we'd all
make a living we'd all make a living
wage doing what we loved and wouldn't
that be cool right yeah we're six years
in now we're coming close to thirty
anywho so when Linus media group bought
that property because it needed it we
couldn't keep working out of my garage
that was not sustainable for me it was
not sustainable for the staff it was
ridiculous it's stupid we should never
should have done it we didn't have the
money that we
it was not optional it just sort of
happened um so I went well Linus media
group bought a house so my goal is for
everyone who works for Linus Media Group
to own a house or if not a detached home
to be in the real estate market and
everyone has sort of different
preferences and different sort of sort
of goals like one of the people who
worked out of that house has it attached
home like way in the middle of nowhere
and then at least a couple of them have
like really decent size townhomes but
that are much closer to the city so it's
like sort of it's everyone's taking a
different approach to it but as of a
couple of weeks ago I achieved that goal
every single person with the exception
of Nick van Berkel who I love dearly but
is no longer my problem is now a
homeowner and so I thought that was
really cool that was that was a really
big personal goal for me and so I'm
feeling really good about myself so I'm
talking about it on one show cool
it's been scary I'm the last variable
and you totally could have done it our
family sure yeah I was like is he ever
gonna like do this like there's I know I
know there's a lot of reasons but like
but yeah I know I know it was a long
time coming for sure I wish you had done
it earlier cuz like Langley Langley real
estate has been a thing I bought it as
its lowest point and like a week after I
bought it the market in that area went
up by 1.6 percent
really yeah so you're already profitable
yeah nice you have okay I'm not gonna
give any details about sort of what the
status is but yeah the deal closed like
a couple weeks back I think is that
right uh I'd like got the keys he's
thinking Wednesday yeah so I've been
there for two days I guess oh you're
there
no well oh really technically yeah okay
except I sort of am because it was an
estate sale
so it's 100% liveable or it's empty well
no it's not empty
there's furnishing I mean in terms of
people oh yeah
basically I got the keys two days after
it closed because there was no one there
but that also means there was like a
couch and right other stuff cool beds
and chairs and desks and everything
really awkward yep anyways moving on
tech topics yeah what was our headline
topic let's do that try and do let's do
that first
yeah anthem yes anthem bug bricking ps4s
this was posted by sovak on the forum
I've already kind of talked about this
on tech linked but we've got a little
bit more details the original article I
know right
um you know what okay no we're gonna
talk about this in a bit I'm gonna do
realize we've actually got a really cool
concept in the works for tech linked
okay thinking of filling in the Tuesday
and Thursday slots with a more detailed
like deeper dive into one topic each day
so tell me what you think of tell me
what you think of the idea I kind of
pitched a name that I liked the name are
eight bits because it's like eight bits
and it's also deeper than two bits you
know so it's deeper than true or false
yeah no I meant like two bits like
here's my two bits
yeah like the yeah yeah and it's you
know eight bit cuz it's like haha it's
nerdy and then and then and then most
people gonna think it's a reference to
graphics yeah exactly and so it's like
it's guys you know how much I love the
double on time yeah yeah yeah so but
then what I thought was we could
actually tie that into the format so
it's something that Riley and James had
been workshopping and I'm not going to
take credit for sort of the idea of us
expanding the tech link to lineup or
like any of this and like mostly this is
me kind of trying to figure out like
branding and presentation of it and like
how to how to streamline it a little bit
but I thought what if we sent a
requirement for ourselves where are
eight bits has to take eight different
pieces eight different opinions from a
minimum of four different sources and
then we've got our two
and we each are in charge of presenting
one side of it within a discussion and a
wrap-up at the end as sort of like a way
to cover deeper topics that are more
opinion driven okay in a fair way are
you guys going to consider doing topics
that you've done earlier that week I
think we would yeah yeah yeah especially
because tech linked is so timely like
it's whatever happened that day at like
6 o'clock yeah yeah so you might not
have the whole story because the whole
story might not exist yet exactly so if
something turns out to be like something
that has further developments in the in
the days that follow I think it would be
a great opportunity to really revisit in
greater depth I don't think it's going
to do as many views as a standard tech
linked episode because the great thing
about tech linked is it's it's
rapid-fire it's funny TM I think it's
funny whatever you guys are I think it's
funny you guys are welcome to your own
opinions that is great I actually love
tech linked it's yeah
it may be my favorite thing that we do
right now other than certain LTT things
like the liquid cooled switch actually
some of the tech kooky stuff we've done
recently is pretty good too everything's
doing really John's been John's been
doing some really cool topics like I
thought the recent ones on wire
headphone jacks going away why removable
batteries are never coming back just
it's it's such a sort of on the surface
obvious thing but then there's other
there's other factors at play and he's
done a good job of summarizing it it's
like the acceptance level of grievance
but in general watching the tech cookie
video on why it's not John is just
helping everyone move on from his like
hurtful moments maybe it's just cuz like
tech lint is the hot new chick or
something but because it's the newest
thing yeah but like I really really like
it anyway I don't think because it's so
rapid-fire and it covers such a broad
variety of things people can click on it
even if they're not necessarily
interested in the headline topic and
there's probably gonna be something in
there for them
yeah whereas this is really gonna stick
to whatever it is we're talking about so
I don't think it's gonna do the same
kind of view numbers but I think it's
kind of important for us to just try
something different
have you guys
looked into how often you would have two
major things per week that you want to
dive into no but I suspect we wouldn't
find any shortage of them because I
think the Tuesday Thursday sessions or
the Tuesday Thursday uploads wouldn't
necessarily have to be so timely like we
could go back and we could look at
something that has been developing for a
long time like article 13 or even be
over for a few months and doing a
retrospective look exactly like hey what
the heck happened with that here's the
post mortem or like what has happened as
a result of that in the last six months
or whatever yeah and like the thing is
with with Juancho with with the regular
tackling format I feel like it's really
hard for us to go back and rehash things
it feels unnecessary because we're
supposed to be more news oriented yeah
so article 13 is a great example of that
where that is still very much going on
behind the scenes it is still very much
a problem and it's like hard to keep
track that's coming very soon but like
we can't just be talking about it every
week or we become some of the other tech
podcasts that I've watched fail over the
years where they're just constantly
harping on the same things and people to
note because it's boring but the thing
is that news isn't always entertaining
I'm sorry and so maybe that's what the
eight bits is is it's the not
entertaining and we're still gonna try
and be entertaining because we're just
funny people but yeah we'd want it to be
a little bit more serious yeah I are you
married to eight bits no should we like
workshop a name I mean with the land
show somehow get them to tweet you or
something um yeah we could you could set
up a tweet of like try to name the new
tech linked segment and get everyone to
respond to it like floatplane chat yeah
I always trust the floatplane peeps
they might beeps yeah yeah okay
I should really actually we haven't read
the intro yet showing sorry floodplain
chat we got this got your fam
nine bits Wow 9001 years
someone said intro is never gonna happen
is time for sponsors boss now yeah
what now yeah what's up what's up have
them sponsor sponsor right there the
ones in the intro yeah you just got your
intro and your sponsors same time what
up now heck yeah no what's up that's up
I'm sorry oh good hi hate to factor but
I also love to factor because I have
like definitely been saved by it on
multiple occasions it's great but it's
really inconvenient alright do you want
to be oh the first external person to
see the place as in going there on your
way home or do you want to wait until
it's set up you know what wouldn't you
prefer like are you talking about your
new place yes yeah huh I don't know why
I decide to drop this now you know what
I'm totally down to come see it but then
also like am I missing out on the on the
big that's what I wanted the house for
me yeah cuz it's like really not so up
and there's just like stuff everywhere
cuz I've been taking stuff home like
once a day kind of situation are you
gonna stream from there yeah
when when's your first stream from there
maybe next week definitely not today
okay you know what I would be down to
come beyond the first stream they're
cool cuz then it'll be a little bit set
up and we should totally play some like
ridiculously stupid games yeah yeah are
you familiar with the game the arrow no
okay let's play some Lee era heck yeah
okay I'm super down we've been playing a
broforce and I've actually been missing
broforce broke horses okay we could
finish broforce
I'm also down with that we could totally
finish but we just do both or something
I think we're pretty close on bro farts
so like we could we could totally a big
round like the last section the other
than playing Workshop Maps yep which who
knows if there's like Oh are there
spoilers in the game like that they have
oil liberate them yeah they think
differently than us go go go okay
spoiler alert
for broforce were past the point where
the alien invasion happens yeah so like
thank work that's clearly the 75 80
percent mark yeah
if every game ever yeah like crisis one
has aliens right or is it crisis 2 that
has aliens I can't for I can't remember
I know crisis 2 does I can't remember it
it does does crisis 1 have aliens I
think so later on crisis and warhead
have aliens there's actual discussion of
course of course there is on game facts
I played warhead on my Dell blah blah
blah don't remember any mention yeah
they had aliens in warhead they show
they first show up in the third mission
in Crysis 1 and alien shows up right at
the start you don't find out until later
they actually have a whole mission
involving explain alien ship yeah ok it
was crisis when I was thinking of and
it's always like you're getting pretty
close to the end of the game when
they're like yeah how do we raise the
stakes
aliens you do even halos like the flight
there's like something that gets thrown
it different aliens yeah yeah these are
grosser looking aliens huh right okay
are we gonna ever do an actual topic
okay well do one top you gotta do the
one yes we do have to do our sponsors
okay so anthem bug bricks ps4 so some
PlayStation 4 players of Bioware's new
loot shooter anthem are finding that
they actually aren't enjoying it that
much and the ones that are enjoying it
that much well some of them are finding
that the game occasionally completely
powers down their console so when
encountering a crash or game error it'll
just get booted to the main menu or out
of the game completely to the ps4
dashboard but then someone else said
twice now when trying to matchmake my
PlayStation 4 has completely turned off
after powering down the ps4 treats it as
an improper shutdown as if the power
cord has been pulled that's bizarre and
then on startup it goes through a short
process of checking the internal
database for any issues before turning
back off again and then restarting as
normal it doesn't sound like a brick at
least two players though have claimed
that the game bricked their console
although one was able to turn their
machine back on again after starting in
Safe Mode so by bricking maybe what we
mean is shut
down unexpectedly which yes can cross
see that problems and can brick a device
okay yeah yeah
however on Wednesday Bioware tweeted
after thorough review we have not
encountered an instance where anthem has
bricked a PlayStation 4 console I would
hate to be the PR person who had to
write that tweet yeah in other great
news we haven't actually killed anything
we're not going to address any of the
other problems so it's unclear if the
shut downs are heat related or caused by
something else and BIOS Bioware says
they will be publishing an update next
week to address the major causes of
these problems wasn't Bioware like the
chosen one at some point yeah for a
while Mass Effect one two and three were
all monumentally fundamentally amazing
games that like changed gaming forever
and then everything since this it's been
garbage you know I suppose the control
necessary game they're good they're
actually really really good
they feel slightly more console as you
go through them
that's fact one feels like like a
definitely feels like a piece based
inventory system like that sort of thing
and then Mass Effect 2 you start getting
combined controls per button
so like one button does like multiple
things and it gets kind of weird it's
still a great game the first like
half-hour to an hour of playing it it's
like what are these controls and three
is kind of the same thing but they are
great games okay you know what I've been
really enjoying lately um our sponsors I
will tell you which game I've been after
but we should really do our sponsor yes
our first monster is oh is LTX not a
sponsor oh no it's a topic well we'll
talk about LT excellent yeah yeah that's
cool our first sponsor is private
Internet access private Internet access
supports a variety of VPN protocols and
types of encryption and authentication
they've got apps for Windows Mac OS
Android iOS Linux and Google Chrome they
can connect up to five devices at the
same time their speeds are fantastic as
long as you've got the CPU for it like
I've seen I've seen like 30 megabytes a
second just like crush my 9900 K in a VM
so it's only is it two cores or for
course pre-course I don't know but it's
that like 70% you
anyway it's PIAA I can't say enough good
things about it check it out today at LM
GGG / p ia when we've got that linked
right there and a VPN is good for all
kinds of things it's super affordable
just do it you want to something a weird
interesting fact that I just remember
today PA was the first VPN that we used
when we were trying to work on and
diagnose things with the forum if you
remember like way vacuuming way the hack
back in the day
the first VPN I ever had you pay for for
working on forum stuff was PA so
technically we've gone way the heck back
with them I also have a confession to
make
while we were still working with tunnel
bear I had a paid PIAA account I have a
free one now because we're working with
them I usually do I still pay for it I
don't think so I did too I did use
tunnel bear and actually I actually have
a really hilarious ton of a tunnel bear
story which did I ever tell you about
how I saved Intel at PAX yes you did
yeah with tunnel there so for some
reason battle.net black black listed all
of Intel's IPs for some reason to log
into battle.net I love that you call it
Donald net but carry on because that's
what it used to be called back in like
the Warcraft to Starcraft days anyways
battlenet battle.net the they couldn't
log it none of the streamers or
competitors there could login to their
battle on net accounts battlenet
accounts whatever to play overwatch so
what I did was I I teamed up with some
Intel employees and I got everyone to
run around and saw tunnel bear on all
the computers and then they would just
turned tunnel bear on login turned to
little bear off play the game it was
great and it worked the whole event they
just turned 12 bear on and off to login
every time it was awesome the thing
about tunnel bear was ease of use yeah
exactly I could sell that all day based
on the ease of use because like my mom
could do it and it was so and it's not
just remember ease of use is more than
just how many buttons you have to press
it's like how friendly the buttons look
honestly it it does
matter I recommended tunnel there to
certain people and I recommended PIAA to
certain people yeah and I use tunnel
various situations where I just needed
something really quick and just for like
a couple minutes and it wasn't even
necessarily my computer or whatever just
get it going free account flow plate and
Chad is mad they're like they literally
changed it back to battle.net because no
one said whatever they renamed it to so
I don't know what you're talking about
what I know I don't know if that sounds
right John says everyone I know calls it
battlenet for sure battlenet now
redirects to just Blizzard comm yeah so
I don't know you guys I think you guys
are all just a little bit on the og side
here well Blizzard battle.net desktop
app yes I don't think they ever changed
the actual terminology but what do they
call it a keynote I think they call it
Battlement also we have another sponsor

okay so what else do we have for topics
to do did you get its LM LM g g g /

/ savage Moho so put savage Moho in even
if you plan on getting save that linked
below if you can't remember that yeah an
MOA is great it is definitely one my
favorite ones my favorite two are Moho
and Moho jalapeno so I think I'd kind of
have a trend going on but like if you
want to mix and match you can still do
that you save 10% on the whole thing do
you want to talk about this not really
actually I don't even care about the
monetization aspect of it like we're
probably going to lose my
position on the land show if we do but
like who cares I guess I also personally
don't find it like I mean I'm down I'm
down not against it I just don't find it
very interesting
so the original sources from the steam
community actually it's an announcement
so steam will not be distributing a game
called rape day mounting following
mounting outrage calling on valve to ban
it so this was I came about because of a
change.org petition and apparently it's
a visual novel where you control the
choices of a sociopath during a zombie
apocalypse according to the developers
website you can virtually harass
verbally harassed verb yeah verbally
verbally harassed kill people and rape
women only women now I wonder if you can
rape men it says it says specifically
women and it's a quote okay so I guess I
guess no no dudes as you progress
through the story you can do these
things
yeah and it's a visual novel which okay
that's a completely different
conversation but like is that even a
game who knows but whatever I guess you
have choices but choose your own
adventure books are those a game so
after a game called active shooter
debuted on Steam last year the company
posted an explanation of their decision
to allow any games to be put on the
platform as long as they were illegal
yeah they described a new system of tags
and filters to either hide or put speed
bumps between users and content they
considered too gory too violent too
sexual or generally too mature
however they decided not to distribute
rape Day saying the move comes after
significant fact-finding and discussion
we think rape day poses unknown costs
and risks and therefore won't be on
Steam we respect developers desires to
express themselves and the purpose of
steam is to help developers find an
audience but this developer has chosen
content matter and a way of representing
it that makes it very difficult for us
to help them do that so in an email
Wednesday night the developer of the
game acknowledged steam might not be the
best platform
for the game I think I might agree with
steam that my game is not right is not
the right fit for a distribution site
that is marketed at the general masses
and children my next move is to sell the
game on my own site maybe that would
have been a better move for me from the
start
so I guess he gets it or she so I don't
know if what I'm about to say is
unpopular I don't personally think rape
is any worse than murder
in that okay I mean we could argue you
know levels of inexcusable I suppose but
they're both well over the threshold of
things that you actually can't do right
so it's they're both these are more than
two extreme forbidden yes
and so I guess I am sort of wondering
what the difference is between a game
where you can joyfully kill people
versus a game where you can joyfully I
mean maybe it's the fact that you can
kill people so fast like if there was a
torture game torture simulator are we
having a similar conversation Wow
someone's gonna make it now there's also
lots of games that include torture
whether I mean it's not necessarily the
main focus of the game but technically
in this one it seems like you could go
along without ever actually raping
anyone you could verbally harass
everyone maybe is that an option and
you'd be just a minor jerk in this game
I haven't and I don't intend to I'm not
going to find out cuz I don't care I
don't know I I just I'm here what you're
saying I'm gonna come from the angle of
hit me it's steam they can do whatever
they want it's probably coming private
platform you have a platform if they
decide they don't want to do it then
they're deciding they don't want to do
it I think a lot of people seem to
forget that in a lot of different
situations where they are putting where
they are saying like hey platform you
cannot do this because of because of my
whatever Amendment rights or whatever no
it's a private company now if you want
to talk to them and you're like you
shouldn't do this because me
and all my people are going to leave
your platform because we want to be able
to say or do whatever that's a different
stance but saying you can't do this
because of whatever right
that's not how that works unless what
they are doing is illegal but but they
are allowed to not allow certain things
on their platform absolute so I'm
completely ok with steam doing this if
steam decided to take FTL one of my
favorite games ever off the platform I'd
be like wow that's really annoying
maybe I'll go get my money somewhere
else but I'm not gonna be like that some
Humble Bundle or something exactly I'll
find a different way to do the epics
game store so I completely defend their
ability to not have it on the platform I
also would never have this show up
because of the tagging system so I don't
really care because I would never see it
so it doesn't necessarily matter to me
because how I'm not gonna enable the tag
that shows that so yeah ok I guess
that's all I really have to say on the
subject I'm not I can check if the
floatplane peeps have anything to
contribute here I mean the thing is that
I guess the the distinction steam is
making here is not between the severity
of the crime being committed by the
character in the game but rather the
cultural climate and potential results
of the emcee being seen as endorsing for
whatever reason killing for fun and you
know brutally in video games is just
culturally fine yeah even like really
really really brutal stuff is culturally
fine but that's because we're more ok
with physical violence I guess I guess
so yeah
or at least depictions of physical
violence alright well um that's the
thing that happened yeah yeah
in other news oh shoot no there was
something else I was gonna talk about oh
man now I totally forget this sucks
before the sponsors buzz
yeah now remember what we were talking
about uh dang it
uh-oh oh uh uh it's not the thing but
LTX guys yeah guys if you want tickets
for LTX um move fast so this is the blog
post from today two weeks ago we opened
sales for an event that is happening in
July so it's like not for a while since
then we completely sold out of the 250
guided office tours we completely sold
out of the VIP tickets actually that
wasn't about the first minute we're fine
Peter um we sold all 500 BYOC seats so I
still need a good considering Peter's
reminding me right now in chat your flow
we flow plane people need computers at
seat area don't worry we've got you okay
cool yeah yeah I just keep reminding
every once in a while so the 500
b-y-o-see seats are the ones that are
for sale yeah and I'm assuming there's
like two other ones I'm just any
influencers that show up are going to
have a seat in case they want to play
that's actually pretty sweet so if J
shows up and he's like yeah I'm guys I'm
not doing meet-and-greet right now I can
actually I can imagine them saying it
exactly like that
besides I'm not doing meet-and-greet
right now I gotta go play some games uh
yeah you don't have a BYOC ticket I'm
sorry I I got to go play video games now
we're still wrong I could totally Victor
I'm just saying that yeah and we've sold
around 1,800 two-day event passes that
is over half of the tickets that are
available for the convention and we've
like barely been selling them and it's a
while until the convention so you should
probably pre buy her two also we haven't
yet confirmed any of the other
influencers that are coming that isn't
to say that we don't know they're coming
I mean we haven't come out and said if
you want to meet so-and-so be there and
we have reason to believe there will be
tech influencers there other than just
me if you don't give two hoots about
Linus Sebastian from Linus tech tips
I don't know why you're watching right
now but that's fine that's cool you know
we're good but if you do care about
other people there is a chance we're
even bringing in some like sub 1 million
subscriber creators just like come on
come on down come be here it's a big
party let's have fun so yeah uh many of
you expressed frustration that you
weren't able to pick up a BYOC pass in
time we are actually trying to arrange
more seating but to do so we have to
revamp our layout and make sure we still
meet our safety requirements so the fire
marshal has some say in terms of how we
layout the venue but we'll let you know
through social media so make sure you're
following LTX Expo on Twitter and if
you're waiting to purchase a ticket
which we would not recommend over half
of the available tickets are already
spoken for please note that prices will
increase by about 20% with each wave of
ticket releases so the dates for the
next waves are April 20th and July 1st
so don't screw around
just get your tickets ordered so they're
at d8j e / l TX 19 we're gonna have that
linked below someone asked will you come
to Dreamhack well which one what are you
talking about exactly because Dreamhack
is gonna be here yeah well okay now to
be clear this is not a zombie oh gee
yeah it's not Dreamhack yeah it's a
b-y-o-see land powered by Dreamhack
we're collaborating with Dreamhack yeah
now it's possible that if this goes
really really well Dreamhack would be
like this was great we're gonna bring a
full fat Dreamhack event to Vancouver
well they they like immediately sold all
the BYZ tickets so might be in your best
interest and it's also possible because
Dreamhack and Linus Media Group each
have no way of knowing how much the the
other affected the sales of these
tickets but what we do know is that
together we're fire yeah so there's a
chance that we could turn that fire into
a fire festival of sorts Oh
sorry I knew something was coming
because I could tell by your facial
expressions but I didn't think it and is
possible but even if they brought a full
Dreamhack event to Vancouver the bank of
our Convention Center has lots more
space there's a good chance that we
could just have a full fat LTX you have
full fat Dreamhack and we could just
like continue to collaborate select yeah
and they're having a lot of fun working
with those guys so far and we're really
excited super cool all right
groan why can possibly go wrong it's
gonna be fire yo oh wow this was the
topic the game you've been enjoying
lately rightful points out for you to
know thank you very much Thank You flow
plane chat I've been playing cross-code
cross-code right yeah so you know how
I've been telling you that one of the
things that I'd love to do as just like
a totally stupid maybe I would never get
there but you know I have I have more
money than I know what to do with I'm
gonna I'm gonna put it all in a in a
dumpster light it on fire and hope that
something good comes out of it
well it would be it would be deafening a
game yeah this is basically like what I
would have wanted to make it's it's a
really retro styled 2d fuzzy team demo
apparently still have they have a web
demo anyway it's it's difficult it's got
a really creative story I'm not that far
into the actual main storyline just cuz
I've been spending so much time just
like grinding for XP and doing side
missions and like and stuff like that
when a game is really good that can be
awesome so like whatever so I don't know
how deep the story goes but it's a
really good concept so far I'm really
enjoying it it's legitimately difficult
although I think part of the problem
might be that I'm playing with a
controller and I just assumed because
it's a top-down RPG that like controller
was the way to go but then even with my
trackpad for a second I was like oh
these keyboard mouse controls actually
seem pretty mature and there's like a
lot of weird bindings on the controller
we're like if you press this one it does
this but if you press this one and this
one it does and
and if you press this one while pointing
in a direction like at exactly the right
moment it doesn't have your thing I'm
like maybe this was a keyboard mouse I
assume but now I know all the controls
of the controller and I'm getting good
with it so I'm like Africa but yeah it's
like legitimately quite difficult and
really really really enjoying it it
doesn't you can you can turn it into a
modern game because you can change
everything from the enemy's attack rate
to the amount of damage they do to the
amount of damage you do yeah you told me
about that but you're - you were not
gonna turn it's never gonna happen no
look no beating game look I almost
lectured my son because he's playing
Super Mario 3d World is that the one for
the Wii U that's not right yeah I think
so move the catsuit yeah yeah he's
playing Super Mario 3d World or has been
playing Super Mario 3d World over the
last little while and he I walked in
once and he was in like a white cat suit
just like walking through all the
enemies and he was like yeah you have to
like die a lot of times and then at the
beginning of the level there's like the
white cat suit and this is like the best
way to beat all the levels and I was
like finish but that is actually not the
best way to beat the game because that
is not beating the game that is staring
at the game I mean you still have to
like not fall off platforms and stuff
but it's not exactly hard making this
really easy game yeah so I was very
disappointed in him and we're gonna need
to work together fortunately he's
already better at smash than me so
there's that he's actually pretty decent
smashing he hasn't even played that much
like I I had never played the smash on
rocky before yeah all right I've never
played that one and I just with a
nunchuck and nunchuck turn to the side
it's a little wonky it's actually oddly
like nunchuck turn demon classic
controller I thought that was super
weird so I switched just a nunchuck
mean the Wiimote yeah you can't play oh
sorry sorry sorry the nunchucks the
extra part yeah so I was playing with
the Wiimote turned to the side and that
was that was whole thing was very weird
but I it was a bit of a struggle fest to
try to beat him and I was like that's
weird because I'm actually I'm not great
at smash but I'm like pretty decent yeah
I don't know so maybe he just needs to
play against other people cuz he's
definitely a hyper competitive kid
yeah like definitely um anything new in
terms of like floatplane I mean Peters
in the chat so the transcode upload
system mainly the transcript system
that's been under work since basically
Peter joined the company other than him
fixing the the live chat that everyone's
talking on right now just in case you
like the live chat work Peter yeah that
upload transcript system is in pre prod
right now and is performing quite
admirably we need to we need to be a
little bit more aggressive about
thrashing it and trying to kill it but
so far it's it's doing quite well and
the it's funny cuz you fix all these
problems and you come up with new
systems and then you're like oh yeah
that problem that we've totally known
about that didn't really matter is now
like super import because all the other
ones have been solved but uploads to
floatplane have been kind of slow for a
long time and like from certain areas
globally they're really not great
like maybe don't work well that didn't
matter as much when the transcodes
barely worked but now the skits are
doing great we need to try to figure out
the upload thing as well so now that's
being worked on and Peter already has
some some great ideas and we've already
been looking into stuff which is cool
mainly Peter and AJ I said we but I
haven't done a lot of that part so
thanks guys
people oh yeah speaking of us beating a
floatplane actually I wanted to also the
app is almost ready for open source it's
almost ready did we even say online show
we were open sourcing the app yet I
don't know there you go we're gonna be
open sourcing the app it's it's come
along Jaden's working on that and it's
it's getting very close to being ready
for open-source developers to jump in
and have fun with it sick all right I'm
trying to think of of what else there's
some the like FAQ support the Search
Search Channel wide search is coming in
hot
that shouldn't be too long from now I'm
trying to think of of what else yeah
we're actually getting shockingly close
so there's a ton of like general
front-end updates and improvements that
are happening we're getting shockingly
close to being able to bring other
people honor yeah speaking of other
people that are already on so tech deals
that is doing a giveaway right now I
just posted it in the floatplane and
YouTube chats he's giving away for RTX
2060s so he's got six videos up in early
access on floatplane wants people to go
subscribe on him subscribe over there of
course but yeah I just posted his tweet
giving all the details in both the
floatplane and the YouTube chat so I
said I would I said I'd give him a shout
out there for that oh he's giving them
away just a floatplane subs oh is he
really early giving away for RTF 26 to
GPUs early access for floatplane subs i
don't know what he means I don't know
either so maybe not whatever full
details in his tweet you guys can figure
it out with him yeah oh yeah there we go
okay okay
all that's left then is some super chats
would you guys are theoretical enigma
says would you guys ever consider taking
LMG public I'd love to invest in the
company it has a bright future in my
opinion it has a really bright future in
my opinion too and that's exactly why I
will not be taking any outside
investment a big part of why I believe
we've and this is I hope not just my ego
you know getting carried away I don't
think it is but a big part of why we've
been successful is that I have had the
luxury of being able to stay 100% true
to my and by my I mean me and Yvonne
because she is a critical part of
everything that happens here staying
true to my vision that we were so close
to having not because I wanted one but
being forced to have an outside
stakeholder
there have been so many times over the
last six years that I have been so
grateful that we don't because there
might have been some kind of crazy
decision like okay at the time we made
it the decision to move into this
gigantic studio space was nuts it was
gonna put us in debt for a very long
time it was totally unnecessary because
we we were still capable of utilizing
the space that we had but if I if I
hadn't made that decision when I did we
wouldn't have gotten to the point where
we could be sustainable in this space
because we never would have been able to
hire those people and the company never
would have grown and that's something
that I don't want to have a stupid like
shareholders meeting and explain my
rationale we're doing it this way
because it's Linus Media Group and
because I believe I know what's best for
it and I mean there's other things too
like yeah we've you know I don't want to
I actually don't want to give too much
detail the way we run this thing though
is I like to run it as close to a family
business as we can and it's gotten more
difficult over the years there's
actually something again I think because
your family's huge dude earlier in the
show about having kind of been doing a
lot of soul-searching lately and it's
gotten harder because we have so many
people here now that's like it's harder
for me to just get to know I have never
met everyone
Riley's brother Barrett I have never met
him and he's done a fair bit of contract
work for us actually I will see him walk
past everyone somewhere I'm like oh yeah
it's that dude that I don't know and
have never met that works in the same
building what I know it's weird man like
there's and like Jayden had never met
Riley and then Riley sat next to Jayden
and they met for the first time ever
working in the same building for a while
like months yeah
and so because because I'm in control
and by I I mean me and Yvonne whether
it's because we want to expand
and or whether it's because maybe at
some point we might make the decision
that we don't want to get any bigger but
whatever it is we can do that and we can
do that as a team with the kind of
transparency that I feel like I've given
my staff over the years that way we can
make these decisions together and
there's no pressure to outside investors
to give them a return on their
investment because that's not what this
business anyway is about for me
there's even there's even smaller stuff
like buying the two Reds yeah I want to
explain that to anyone no and there was
no business case for it I mean honestly
the biggest reason that we did that was
because it was like an optics thing we
were a tech channel using outdated tech
for our production and I was like well I
guess we need to I guess we need to like
if we're gonna be on the cutting edge I
was like okay well I guess we'll try and
get a bunch of content out of it like
we'll do videos about workstations that
can handle 8k and we'll like we'll
experiment with the footage and we'll
we'll do videos about sort of the
workflow changes that we have to make
and well like we'll try and get some
content out of it but ultimately it was
about making sure that if we're supposed
to be cutting edge content creators that
were using cutting edge tools in order
to do it and then the other reason that
was sort of a close runner-up I guess
was that Brandon is probably my most
expensive employee not because he
necessarily has the highest salary or
takes up the most space in the building
but because in order to keep his
creative juices flowing it requires a
constant outpouring of resources into
new gear so that we can continue to try
to push boundaries not necessarily on
every video we upload plenty of like
vlogs that are just shot shoulder held
that could have just as easily been shot
on a Panasonic gh4 but there's one
coming a review of the Corsair of the
new Corsair one on Saturday that's just
it's just gorgeous
and so there's different there's weird
bits to it too like one of it is I
didn't understand a lot of stuff before
I became a boss of people one of them
was one of your expenditures as a
company is like doing things that your
employee wants to do if that makes sense
and like increasing someone's job
satisfaction was part of the expenditure
of buying something yeah you wanted that
thing and yeah I made things better but
you also bought it because you're like
Kate well I like this person I want them
to stay around so I'm gonna kind of
throw them a bone here and there's also
other parts of it where like I still
love that the intro to my amethyst PC
build is freaking beautiful because
whenever I want to show someone I'm like
look at this incredibly well filmed
incredibly beautiful intro that's all
you need to see there you go and like it
so it it adds things in other ways as
well and those those types of concepts
are really not necessarily even
difficult to explain but difficult to
show the value to an investor who
probably doesn't care exactly so you
just don't and like part of it is cause
like we're just enthusiasts we don't
need 10 gig networking on every port in
the office but earlier on the stream I
was saying that we blew like 7 grand on
switches so that we can have that so if
we were to plug literally anything into
any port in our office it's gonna be 10
gig baby why why not I mean even the new
Internet I was like oh oh
dedicated wavelength is available now
how many was that I could probably
squeeze that um we'll figure out what to
do with it yeah let's get let's get it
scheduled you know like I don't know we
because the thing is like we're not like
we're not really a traditional kind of
company I don't think what we're doing
has ever been done before and I don't
mean that there aren't other companies
like I don't know mythical yeah like
mythical entertainment or the ones with
the trick shots do perfect yeah
like those are probably perfect examples
of other teams that are doing something
quite similar but I mean collectively
the teams that are doing this this whole
group of has never been done before and
so the thing is that I think a lot of
traditional business people probably
wouldn't understand that we have to do
things just because they're fun because
if we don't have fun you guys aren't
gonna have fun and then nobody's having
fun and what's the point it bleeds
through the camera way more than you'd
realize it's pretty crazy wow that was a
really long answer to that question I'm
very sorry Andre Luke that works what
about questions when yo asks every team
just curious yes I love poutine but only
good poutine yes and a shocking amount
of poutine sucks
yes it's very basic okay the cheese is
supposed to be melted so if the gravy
isn't hot it's not good how is that
complicated : yeah poutine
like it's ridiculous okay I'm a slow
eater but you can make the fries
properly for that they just have to be
little bit crispier yeah oh they will
for sure but you should make crispy your
fries with it yeah besides you can
always like fork and knife ins you can
fork a knife it when it gets like yeah
you know a little soggy but the point is
if you start out with cheese that is not
sufficiently melted because you got
lukewarm friggin gravy on it does it
stupid like 80% of the poutine I've ever
had has not been sufficiently melted
yeah you had one job let's melt the
cheese because how do you make cheese
and gravy and french fries gross it's
like that's hard all you have to it has
to be hot food is supposed to be hot
unless it's ice cream
in which case look the thing is it
sounds stupid coming out of my mouth
because it's so obvious but people can't
do it so I have to explain it to them
dealing with the real problem I want to
explain this to people I have better
things to do
oh my goodness like explain to other
things like tech stuff
gamer off topic says how's the hiring
process going
hope it's not super stressful I actually
haven't been involved in most of it like
that's one of the behind the scenes
thing that Yvonne does she's been
training ed and Nick and Colton and I
think there's I think even Tyler's been
involved in some of the hiring lately so
there's been a lot of it I'm actually
some some applications and some
positions are getting to me now so the
warehouse assistant position I have
three resumes on my desk to call and
then the writers are gonna take me a
long time we're hiring a couple of
writers that's a very yeah that's a
tough one I make the wrong call with a
writer and like the content sucks it
like that there's nothing more
foundational to our business then like
the content idea and the writing and
it's gonna take a while to get a writer
up to speed and all that kind of stuff
so it's gonna be hard to tell for quite
a while you can see in his eyes yeah
yeah Colton why is he gone I dunno are
we allowed to talk about the the the the
madrenas thing like how much detail can
we give about that not much okay a lot
of stuffs kind of secret stuff now yeah
king CCG says I work in tech for a high
value mortgage company I'm allowed to go
to one event a year do you do business
packages for your media conference no
it's not really a media conference I
don't think you're gonna justify getting
this one continent uh-huh what a
business package be I have no idea I'm
sure they have them cuz like there's
lots of conferences that not just our
more business-oriented but are like
super expensive to attend apparently IBM
think tickets are like hundreds or
thousands of dollars or something like
that yeah I'm just like dudududu this is
cool
we have a video coming from IBM think
pretty soon
Peters speaking at a conference about
some of the work he's done on flow plane
oh that's cool yeah I don't know how big
I didn't look too far into it he was
like can I do this
I didn't even click on I was like yeah
that's sweet awesome I just think that's
really cool I think it's cool that
someone's gonna go talk about the stuff
they've worked on that flow plane at a
conference and it's it's about I believe
it's docker for tea peeps or so that's
still cool Peter it is amazing how
high-profile float plane is yeah like
people have heard of it yeah one of the
like one of the friends of the the main
the main guy behind vessel showed up at
a wedding that I was at recently and was
like hey how's floatplane going I was
like that's funny thank you for asking
Jason says just switched over from two
float plane will clean cool and mobile
in the app I mean I guess it depends
it's gonna be an open-source app so what
makes it our cool show says Luke what
are you doing - crash Firefox also try
survived IO what are you doing for crash
Firefox on wall it says can we please
get more camera reviews by Brendan the
new pocket camera yes so our first one
of the new pocket camera which isn't
that small by the way it's hardly pocket
anyway our first one was broken so it's
taken us a long time to get a fixed one
because they're they have no supply
because they're black magic so yeah
someone in chat sorry someone a full
plane shot saddest floatplane plan to be
a tech oriented platformer do you guys
have plan on having multiple different
types of creators we actually have a
different type creator that isn't tech
person who's extremely interested in
joining and will hopefully be on the
flop platform and not way too long that
I am like extremely excited about and
you probably even remember within like
weeks of making the platform I was like
it would be really cool if we had this
guy but I can't say who but we don't
want to count any chickens before
they're exactly yeah yeah yeah but we're
bullish
yeah it's actually kind of crazy there's
been so many times over the last two and
a half years that's almost been there's
been so many times has almost died
yeah like or almost look like it's not
gonna work and then every time it kind
of doesn't matter because we go and talk
to creators and they're interested yeah
they're just like it's like what do you
like about us well you're not Google and
you're not Amazon okay that's a pretty
low hanging fruit I guess but like
that's how important Trust is in
business and that's something that I
actually didn't necessarily fully
understand about this product before we
started creating it was that even though
that was in a lot of the write-ups it
was like hey you can trust us I didn't
necessarily think that people would
trust us but what's kind of cool is that
our reputation among the Creator
community actually seems to be pretty
good strong even though we don't really
talk to anybody like you were saying you
were at twitchcon twitchcon twitchcon is
a wild experience like you would be it
would be honestly for you you'd probably
get recognized by a lot more of the fans
as well but at twitchcon there is
actually much less of a crossover than
you would expect of the fans I think
there's a lot of people that are either
twitch people or YouTube people and who
has a viewership yeah so when I walk
around twitchcon there's some fans
that'll come up to me but way way less
than somewhere like pax or a more tech
oriented convention but what will happen
is there'll be like a group of fans
around a creator and the creator will
like pause things for a second and push
through the group of fans to come say hi
to me because he's seen our content or
she's seen our content because they need
to build a computer for streaming or
whatever else apparently I helped an
munition build her first computer suite
alright so I didn't meet her until
obviously years later when we were like
on a panel together yeah and she like
didn't even tell me she just like said
it and I was like I don't think that
video ever got released which is really
frustrating it was only like little
snippets that were part of like like a
keynote or something
so unfortunately was actually a really
great conversation it was me 7s
ammunition was his name now I feel
really that already sounds like a wicked
pet anyway yeah it was it was really fun
and the moderator for it was like really
good I forget her name - unfortunately
I'm so rude sometimes I'm just so bad
with names - but that sounds like an
awesome anyway yeah it was it was great
and just like the vast majority of it
will never see the light of day which
socks I the one interesting one you've
known I was a fan of day 9 forever zzzz
I met him at a twitchcon like a year -
ago have even told me this story I don't
think so I was I was hanging out met him
and he didn't know who I was I was just
with a friend of mine who knows him very
well right and he was like you want to
go hang with day-night after I was
talking about how much I liked Dean I
was like what and then he brought me to
go hang out with him and we're just like
sitting around at some at some like
hotel lobby thing for a while it's it's
after the show day 9 was on stage like
all day with Conan O'Brien he's like
tired and just kind of relaxing and
everyone's just kind of hanging out but
I start talking to him and I'm like I
don't want a fangirl for too long but
like I I appreciate everything you've
done and you like helped me find my
voice I started being a creator and all
this kind of stuff he's like oh that's
cool what's your channel and I was like
I've been working on last exhibition
he's like you're from widest tek-tips
it's like he's like you guys are huge I
was like that's pretty sweet
that was when I did more like stuff with
the channel but like yeah yeah hey
you're still in wine show that's true
yeah but yeah that was like that was
kind of a wild moment oh speaking of
still in win show I'm probably gonna get
in trouble for talking about this oh but
we do have a little a little video
series that you might have heard of
before that that we weren't really sure
about doing another season of because it
seemed like maybe it had kind of run its
course it doesn't get it's not about the
views
yeah the community sentiment wasn't
great really yeah the earlier part of
the season okay yeah yeah anyway anyway
little series that you might have heard
of called scrapyard Wars and we are
still working on a sponsor for season
eight or nine or whatever it's gonna be
at this point but I think I have like
Luke and I have a doc like ideas for
scrapyard Wars and I kind of threw it
all out well part of the problem was we
kind of ran out of most of the ideas on
the dock that were local we've kind of
used yes traveling for scrap bird wars
is obscenely expensive or we've come up
with other problems that interfere with
them like the fact that everyone like
recognizes us locally but I came up with
a new concept well I was just sitting
thinking about something totally
unrelated that I think is gonna make for
the best season yet so instead of being
a 1 V 1 or 2 V 2 it's actually going to
be 3 V 3 ok so the stakes are already
higher instead of just building a tower
you are now responsible for a tower
monitor keyboard mouse audio solution
desk and chair an entire gaming setup so
there's six players and each individual
is responsible for an entire setup then
where the teamwork element comes in at
the beginning of the season we're going
to go head to head in our land center
that we're working on so with everybody
on an even playing field
good computers we're gonna go head to
head and figure out what the fairest
teams would be then we're gonna split
along those lines and instead of having
a benchmark off at the end of the season
we are going to game for the trophy now
here's the catch there's always a catch
each player is only going to get my
haven't a hundred percent decided on it
but I think it's probably going to be in
the neighborhood of about five hundred
everything and like okay you had a
really good one with sound you want
sound you gotta buy it you want a good
keyboard or Mouse you got to buy it that
could be almost that whole budget for
some people legitimately right so you
will have your team will have to make
decisions like are we going to have
headphones or tits like does one person
have to listen for everyone and shout
out instructions do we do we do we go
for better mice or do we go for sound do
we do do we spend more on the hardware
so we have a good frame rate but are we
literally running on ball mice do we
pool resources and try to have one more
wicked setup and everyone else is Michi
I think it's gonna be hilarious so I'm
really excited so it's gonna come down
to which team can perform best on the
battlefield so we don't run into another
situation where a point one FPS
difference ultimately results in the
trophy being handed out to the wrong
person Wow so it's freaking fired
oh man so I'm really excited the one
rule in terms of teams and I don't know
who's gonna be involved yet as talent
but the one rule in terms of teams is
that luke and i will definitely not be
on the same team because each team is
going to need an experienced scrapyard
wars er is probably going to cost us an
absolute fortune to do because not only
is the shooting gonna be more
complicated like previously we've had
the rule that the team after stay
together so that their shooter can
capture everything yeah we're not going
to be able to do that you have to build
three setups so we're gonna need
somewhere between four and six shooters
so that's gonna be expensive I have some
ideas for that
okay I will that might actually save you
a ton of money we will brainstorm those
okay also the Edit is going to be much
more complicated because you're gonna
have all these storylines oh yeah and
all these video sources like this is
going to cost a fortune for us to do but
I got and so I had kind of given up
because in order for us to keep raising
the stakes I mean that's why TV shows
get cancelled because all of a sudden
you've got all these additional actors
for all the new characters you've
introduced over the years you've got all
these new sets and locations that it
just it becomes unsustainable and
everyone wants a raise every season like
it's like you have to everything has to
get crazier every time that's right the
big bad has to be bigger and badder we
jump the shark you know and then you're
like okay forget it we're done right so
we don't want to jump the shark but this
was an idea that I went No this is good
enough that it's different and it's
going to be fun and it's going to be
exciting and the show down at the end
like I want it to be best two out of
three and the best two out of three of
those so three games with each game
being a best two out of three turning
and it could be like we couldn't
livestream it
unfortunately because then we'd give it
away two months before the season
actually starts airing but anyway okay
whatever well if you could livestream
like everything is over the finals and
we could capture the entire thing
actually and we could just have that as
like a floatplane exclusive if you guys
want to watch the entire tournament
yeah because otherwise it's only gonna
be able to be highlights yeah but but
anyway that that final showdown because
there could be like back and forth like
maybe in FPS the people who spent more
on their mouse and their Tower have an
advantage but maybe in a MOBA game where
it's not quite as as sensitive maybe
there's an advantage to the people with
you know uh bigger monitor I don't know
there's there's also gonna have to be a
little bit of like maybe FPS some quite
so important you know like yeah you have
to say it's me a little bit of like
trust in sportsmanship as well but I
think course I think everyone will be
cool like we're gonna have to balance
the teams a little bit based on like how
good people are at different games yeah
like I don't think anyone here is gonna
throw no like
but like animal and I'm saying that now
because I know there's gonna be comments
about that if it ever comes up but I
genuinely don't think anyone that would
partake in this competition would throw
or do anything ridiculous I know
sandbagging yeah we have been live for
almost an hour and a half we should
probably go home okay it's like 6:45
okay uh so sorry bye guys got sorry byes
guy next week same bat-time same
bat-channel
five Peter
a gun stream over Peters tele able to
spam and flow play chat go go go what
why he wants to see if it's gonna crash
