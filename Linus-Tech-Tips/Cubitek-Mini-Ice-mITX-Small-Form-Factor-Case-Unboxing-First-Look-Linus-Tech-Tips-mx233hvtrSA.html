the cuba tech mini ice you can see that
it was sent from new taipei city in
taiwan okay there's some sort of yeah
sort of okay box are going on here but i
think where we're really going to enjoy
this unboxing is once the box is
actually open because this is a case
that i think looks incredibly cool this
is a mini ITX chassis with ok as you
might imagine based on their mini ice
name and the fact that the tagline for
it is frozen solid with their this is a
mini ITX case with fairly advanced
cooling features that can also support
some pretty advanced hardware so the
first thing we see when we open it up is
an accessory box but we'll get to that
later we also see the packaging now
they're using a hard foam i would prefer
to see a soft foam however due to the
aluminum construction of this case it
really doesn't weigh a whole lot so it's
a lot less likely to damage its packing
materials during the shipping process
and I mean it's honestly if it managed
to survive an air shipment from Taiwan
to here and it's not probably about as
much of a of a stress test as you're
going to need for it however once it's
loaded up with components having a
different conversation because it does
support some pretty high-end internal
components including a full sized ATX
power supply as well as a graphics card
up to 340 millimeters
there's a bad boy up alright so actually
give me a second to get acquainted here
guys so I'm just kind of checking things
out here it arrived a little bit dusty
but it's nothing that doesn't come off
with the old sleeve wipe so to speak so
let's have a look at the outside of the
case before we go too much further here
so on the top you're gonna see a 140
millimeter fan that is set up as an
exhaust fan so this is only compatible
with 140 ml you can see the holes are
hard drilled around the outside of the
growth in terms of i/o we have front USB
to two of those two front USB 3 as well
as front headphones and microphone the
overall look of the case actually
reminds me a little bit of mighty jo7 in
that it has this single piece aluminum
thing going on on the front sorry I
guess I'm trying to be really careful
with them touching it too much because
once you touch brushed aluminum
basically the finishes ring forever so
you can see it's a solid piece going all
the way up the front and then it's
another solid piece going all the way up
the back and the meeting right here so
it's 2 pieces going around the whole
outside of the case which i think is
really cool you've got an optional VGA
cooling intake here as well as feet on
the bottom of the case giving it a
little bit of space to breathe on the
front of the chassis let's just lift it
back up we've got a five and a quarter
inch optical drive bay as well as our
power and IDE or Russian called IDE like
so a hard drive activity indicator we've
got power and reset buttons as well as a
stylish cuba tech logo going on here
alright let's move around to the back of
the case where we find our standard ATX
power supply mount so you can see that's
done with just a couple thumb screws you
screw your power supply into the plate
and then slide the whole thing into
place this is much like the pc qo7 that
i have in for my media pc downstairs
water cooling holes if you wanted to
externally water cool it i hope you're
not going to do that with a
configuration like this though because
you do have a fair amount of room
included for an air cooler so you can
see a lot of boards going to
right about beyond so any air cooler
that'll fit within here actually I think
the dimensions hold on maximum of 90
millimeters or nine centimeters from the
from the motherboard itself so we've got
two expansion slots yes this is mini ITX
and we also have a very unique system
for attaching the side tunnels so these
are little thumb screws that have
Holland key spots in them so if you
wanted to use an allen key to and I'm if
it comes with an Allen wouldn't surprise
me that much if you're gonna go ahead
and you know make your case open up with
an allen key and guess you'd better
include one there it is haha allen key
slash buzzer so it does come with a a
speaker which is what I think they mean
by buzzer alright there we go then we
cut another one here or these how this
isn't so bad
I could I can dig it okay and there we
go so solid aluminum haha
I'm totally gonna do it the iPhone
thickness comparison BAM now you know
how thick the panel is it's a fairly
thick actually it has a very rigid feel
to it so this is in theory to reduce the
overall vibration of the case
so the overall noise level the case they
also have anti vibration rubber
dampeners here on the side panels this
can be a real problem for aluminum cases
if you don't have some way to to isolate
the vibration because they're much
lighter weight than there's steel
counterparts which has the advantage of
being well lightweight attractive easier
to work with you can make more beautiful
aluminum cases than you often can out of
steel and and plastic but the drawback
is that well it's not as strong so you
have to use thicker material which can
be marks ten
and then also that it's not as notice
not as heavy these side panels off here
all right here you can see the other one
if you want basically looks the same
like the same thing and also has the
rubber noise dampening solution
implemented on the other side as well
you can see that can also see the
motherboard tray as well as the interior
cables look at that all black cables
very nice touch like to see that alright
so inside here we got a few things we
have oh this is kind of neat hold on I'm
gonna have to go find a hard drive so I
can install this entry basis right so
here are the rubber noise isolation
fasteners as well as some included hard
drive screws and of course once you've
installed them you have a nice little
truck to play with see how the wheels
realistically turn just like a real
vehicle would mom for know so here's how
you actually install your hard drive you
go ahead and you slide this bad boy into
whoops no ah first you need to take this
off there we are
and then this slides out of the way
pretty cool I guess you don't have to
take it all the way off either yeah
slide those guys in there and then you
slide it in the right way if you want to
have an optimal user experience and then
you click this over here which will
prevent the wheel from moving and
continue to isolate the vibration from
your hard drive so that's pretty cool
hey I certainly think so they also
include and for a lot of companies this
is sort of optional stuff but they see
how this one already has the sliders
installed and it has a dual
two-and-a-half inch SSD mount included
so you can do up to three
three-and-a-half inch hard drives and
two two-and-a-half inch hard drives in
spite of the fact that this is an ITX
enclosure check that out
there's your 140 millimeter internal
cooling fan with an included black three
pin cable what else we got in terms of
interior ah yes so let's show just what
kind of space there is for installing
graphics cards this is cool so I'm gonna
grab the longest graphics card that I
happened to have handy which also
happens to be the longest graphics card
that anyone happens to add handy
probably this is a Radeon HD 6990 so if
you wanted to build yourself an extreme
little gaming box with tempest Ahsan
extremely little you could throw even a
Radeon 6990 in here with room to spare
and you can throw a 120 millimeter fan
down here which you can use either as an
exhaust or as an intake depending on the
configuration of your card so if you're
using a blower fan like this guy right
here I would probably use it as an
intake so that's really cool I'm about
five and a quarter inch Bay is pretty
self-explanatory in fact I think the
rest of this case is mostly pretty
self-explanatory very cool little
enclosure so for a size comparison I
mean here it is next to a fairly bog
standard mini tower also next to the
mangos that I was eating that I'm no
longer eating and will take downstairs
shortly so you can see it's quite wide
for an ITX enclosure and the reason for
that would be so that they'll have all
the space that they allocated for things
like coolers as well as the full-size
power supply but it is very very short
compared to mid Tower so it'll look
right at home on your desk without
without that looking weird ah yes the
internal connectors so pretty standard
stuff here - so we've got our front
panel connectors you know your LEDs your
reset switch power switch your front HD
audio as well as your front USB wah USB
- and your front USB 3 so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the cuba tech Wow I just completely
drew a blank what does it even call mini
ice
