yeah we're not quite on time we're
closer than we have been for the last
like three weeks since we've been like
half an hour yes okay in my defense this
week you came from a different country I
was in France yeah for three days yeah
and I am jet-lagged as hell so I had a
brilliant idea on this trip I was like
hmm I'm flying out for France on Sunday
afternoon so like a 1 1 p.m. flight it's
about I don't know 9 and a half hour
flight or something like that it's like
9 and a half hours there 11 hours back
or something like that sure so I'm
flying out for 9 hours so that'll make
it nighttime home when I get there but
it'll be about 8 a.m. France time so I
only have one day where I have any kind
of work obligation to our sponsor so
here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna land
in the morning see if I can get early
check-in I'm going to sleep away the
entire day I'm gonna stay up all night
and then I'm gonna pull effectively an
all-nighter
to stay up the day of France time and
then go to sleep in like the morning of
home time and then pull like another
all-nighter effectively doing two nights
of sleep over three days and stay awake
on the whole flight home and then
collapse in my bed around four hours
after my flight land so I did manage to
get as far as collapsing in my bed when
I got home but even the nine and a half
hour sleep that I got was not enough to
and while I was on this trip don't tell
our sponsor but during the keynote
I passed the crap by you across the
world
okay okay I have a few things to say the
front No
okay but I'm in the front of the next
section Oh boom there was a fair bit of
foot traffic look no one noticed Colton
propped me up oh he had his own problems
he like threw up so many times he had it
he had a bad nick McBay goal or
something I think I'm not sure what it
was I'm not actually blaming McDonald's
okay but that McBay gold didn't look
good anyway I'm not actually blaming
McDonald's but the McBay go over there
looks disgusting sorry I'm not actually
blaming McDonald's um they've been
making bagel do we have a McBaine oh no
they actually apparently test a lot of
stuff in France because French people
apparently eat a lot of McDonald's which
is I mean they're known for like they're
like haute cuisine food culture and yeah
McDonald's chez McDo apparently big deal
um anyway um where was I going with this
okay no shut up
in my defense okay the things that I was
actually there for was to livestream
during the event which we told them
wasn't going to work okay and it didn't
they were like no we're gonna have like
your own Wi-Fi and it'll be fine and I
was like that's not gonna help
but we're gonna humor you and it cut out
like five times in 20 minutes yeah and
we were like were done now and then I
was also there to participate in like a
photo challenge slash fan meetup in
Paris right I saw that part yeah and
sought stay awake for that yeah I was
okay we actually had a wonderful lunch
with some of our amazing French fans
okay actually it was it was awesome
because we were supposed to eat at the
same restaurant as everyone else but
then there weren't enough seats for our
fans so we were like well I think we're
gonna have to just peace and we're gonna
go somewhere else and one of the guys
who is gonna be a total inside joke but
I'm gonna refer to him as French Alex P
okay yeah he picked this amazing
restaurant like more French oh yes okay
okay
I'm sure Rose yeah well no cuz because
he's Canadian French that's different
than French French is it not different
it would
French he says it's different see um so
I'm gonna describe him as French Alex P
okay so anyway he picks this amazing
restaurant I have the most amazing steak
the most amazing dessert like the most
amazing bread just everything's amazing
we had an amazing lunch was awesome for
it do you have a for people in France
France France what is it where was it I
don't know okay yes sorry I'm not good
at these things um but it was awesome
cooze awesome you can never experience
it cuz I can't we just like hung out
just like bro doubt fur and shouldn't
say bro doubt we actually had a mix so
we've had gear so we hung out for like
90 minutes or something like that had a
really nice relaxing lunch then we went
over to the keynote and the other thing
okay so the other thing is the sponsor
the other sponsor obligation was that we
had a video that went up around the time
of the keynote yeah except that we had
pre-recorded that because they're super
smart like one plus and they just sent
us its honored so they just sent us the
thing ahead of time so we could record
it before we got there which is like
brilliant so while we were over there it
was supposed to be pretty chill now I
chilled out a little hard I don't think
they were expecting me to pass out in
the audience but again in my defense it
was pretty long just like he's like yeah
okay so here's the things we've like
still got to do and we got to get we got
to get you out of here man cuz you are
like not looking good like I get to this
point of tired where I actually get kind
of giddy and like I sick start to say
stuff that's like really kind of stupid
you've probably encountered it before
yeah
so I actually you know what I was
probably getting to that point when we
were talking about our restaurant
concept yeah that's I was to do certain
degree okay so that was me everyone
starts laughing at weird stuff when they
get super tired
so that was my headspace when I was
meeting the President of Honor
fortunately it was just a quick photo op
and I didn't have to try to say anything
intelligent I'd have been like okay
I know mate mobile phones great business
good idea keep doing that but do I ever
have a pitch for you okay a restaurant
where the menu is I still think it's a
game okay so you go with your friends
okay
we've actually worked out the concept
pretty well man yeah yeah I order like a
protein and a salad okay you order or
protein in like a green sure a protein
and a green sure I'll go with like a
protein and a and a soda everything's
cheap everything's like five bucks oh
yeah four dollars or something like that
totally unreasonable yeah so like you
know every once in a while your protein
it's gonna be a freakin tomahawk steak
oh yeah and then every once in a while
it's good to be a hot rod does like 50
cent pepperoni sticks to leave in the
gas station yeah you might get that
you'll probably usually get bad it's
like junk junk junk that's okay I only
spent order like for loot boxes or
something cuz maybe you'll get one
that's good you might also get four hot
rods did we make it for hot rod for like
for hot rods and a pickle but hey yeah
if you had an experience the fun was in
the excitement of opening up your loot
box to dinner yeah you know I actually
liked the concept though oh man like
beverages beverages like here's tomato
here's tomato paste and apple juice oh I
guess you should get another one then
that's a like an apple juice with Caesar
like things inside it like bacon and
celery and like pepper look that is
apparently a sales pitch hey it's fun
because you don't know what's coming
people buy these things
yeah I don't make the rules here few
people yeah and the best part is you
would totally get put out of business
oh yeah nobody would stand for that no
and then what I love about this is like
honestly I'm gonna be wildly successful
for like two months I'd be kind of
tempted to do it just to make a point
if this isn't acceptable in food if
gambling is not okay for a restaurant
then why is it okay in gaming huh just
as like a form of protest like how much
would it actually cost us if there's
John a family's there's got to be a
place where you can do pop-up
restaurants there's gonna be I mean
there used to be a Quiznos like in my
neighborhood that's just like still set
up Luke blue box for consumed which I
don't know what combination
this one's six mustards pepperoni
it's basically liquid have or it's like
a build-your-own sandwich but you have
to loot box all the ingredients I know
right so you like loot boxed your bread
and then you loot box all your meats and
your greens and your sauces I mean he
just like figure out what you get at the
end oh my goodness well yeah there's got
to be some form of place where you can
do like oh uh your your restaurant
failed I'll take over your lease for
like a few months all right
it's not permanent yeah exactly honestly
I think that I think it's even though
the subway idea oh I didn't want to tell
people about that but they don't know
okay sure sure sure
I don't want that's yeah that's all I
want to go into it with that okay okay
but like oh oh no no no no no that's not
it's not like close enough to reality
maybe on Friday wait hold on let me see
if I understand you correctly
Oh oh no no okay
okay but I mean like using the time of
that concept Oh
like the issue is how much work you
would have to do to prepare to like open
a restaurant cuz like you'd have to
actually work on the menu
you'd have to stock a kitchen of very
unconventional things that yes you would
have to work on the menu though oh just
loot boxes well yeah okay you'd have to
have an internal menu though and then
you'd have to have like a dice system
there's well there's two different ways
to do that there's the sandwich you loot
box a sandwich ingredients or whatever I
don't know maybe yeah I'm not sure which
one people wanted at LTX no no no no we
actually want lb X's food options good
to be as good as they possibly can be
yeah are we doing food trucks again um
so okay because we're gonna be at the
Vancouver Convention Center there's like
they're just like always there and it's
downtown there is gonna be food inside
the convention and I think for
influencers for creators because we have
like like a bundle that are like
interested in coming I'm so excited
yeah but for influencers we have to have
them catered by the venue but then other
than that I don't think there's any
obligation for people to buy food at the
venue which is really cool totally
different from last year yeah where
there just really weren't any options
yeah and I have a really exciting LTX
update believe it or not I have no idea
cuz I'm just generally excited for it
yes so there's a new update in the blog
that's cool okay okay okay okay okay so
just first look first look at some of
the booths that we have planned for this
year
tech experiences we're going to do a
performance versus cost test zone so
what we're gonna do is ahead of the show
we're gonna do a video on like $500
$1,000 $1,500 $2,500 $5,000 gaming
machines and we'll go wolf spec out the
best thing we can box peripherals
monitor boom here's the gaming
experience per dollar
then we're gonna load all the same games
up on them and you can actually float
around so if you were trying to decide
how much money do I want to spend to
become a member of the PC master-race
you could just kind of go oh well I want
kind of somewhere in between here and
you can go in like it may be a decision
yeah so are you guys gonna have monitor
differences there is that bundled into
the thing just like I won 40 versus 60
yes and it will affect the entire gaming
experience but that was sort of the best
bet we had for how to do it because the
thing is that even on like a $500 box if
you had $1,000 monitor with g-sync that
has really really like a really wide
variable or refresh rate window and
stuff it's gonna make it seem better
than it is yeah versus if you were
playing on the kind of monitor you would
typically have on a rig like that yeah
so we want to make sure that we're
representing every price point
completely yeah so that's amazing the
monitor you should probably have at that
price point we'll be with it that's very
um headphone testing zone so a lot of
people ask well should I get closed or
open backed and that's gonna be the main
thing here is I I think we're trying to
get a headphone brand to sponsor it so
it would all be like options from the
same brand but just to test in a crowded
environment you can still get a range of
styles active noise-cancelling versus
just passive noise isolation versus open
backed so that you can really try it out
for yourself and playing games cuz like
a lot of the time even if you go to
trade shows if you go to like a
headphone booth they don't have any it's
all music lots of people use like
audiophile headphones for gaming because
they're smart and so those smart people
can now make a more educated decision
yeah zer do lots of VR so the VR booth
is going to be something like four or
five times the size good and it's gonna
have it between a dozen and 15 headsets
that's awesome last year we had three
for reference so it's not enough no yeah
so this is gonna be way better I'd also
love to have some different experiences
lined up so that like a couple the rigs
are like it's this game you play
head-to-head with your buddy that'd be
awesome
yeah honestly I think I always forget
the name of it but it's like holo arena
or something I think it's 3 V 3 having
not able to be set up but really cool I
haven't tried that I don't remember the
name of it it's I always free I always
forget the name of it on my show I don't
know why but it's a really good game and
a vehicle experience ah VR car C car
race maybe okay so here's what we have
planned for this I'm not sure if we're
gonna end up being able to make it work
in VR actually but you're familiar with
like drone racing right yeah so those
low latency wireless camera systems that
they use for drone racing yeah there is
no real reason why you wouldn't be able
to do that on an RC car so the idea here
is that we want to build with like jumps
and everything like a 50 foot by 50 foot
course that you then get into a virtual
cockpit and like so cool drive on
oh my so everyone watching will be just
watching these little cars going around
on the track but actually you'll be
sitting and you'll be sitting in the
front and it's gonna feel so interesting
because are we doing like the actual I'd
like to I don't think we're gonna go
full-on like Oh bot Oh like racing thing
but as long as you've got like kind of a
fixed chair one of these countries I'd
love to make it work with pedals as well
and a wheel yeah like as long as you've
got a wheel pedals and at least a chair
that feels kind of like this yes going
over one of those jumps and stuff and
like ramming someone else yeah it's me
while I think it's gonna be pretty cool
so that's something that we want to do
figure out as a video ahead of time yeah
and then go from there cool um an escape
room maybe there I think there's like a
local escape room company that wants to
set up like a custom escape room
experience for us cool
BS mods TVD but they're maniacs so like
whatever it is it's gonna be like
something modding and cool
oh we're gonna bring back the workshop
concept in full force
awesome so not there's only CPU D living
um you do need to sign a waiver for that
one we're not taking responsibility I
dia but that was a much bigger hit last
year than we thought so many people
showed up with CPUs so that they could
deal it in a supervised environment I
had people talking about how they wanted
to go to the event just cuz they were
too scared of doing it on their own and
there's nothing wrong with that that
totally makes sense
the first time you've ever done it and
check this out Steve from gamers Nexus
who I guess is now outed as someone who
is coming came up with the idea of us
doing a GPU disassembly and repainting
workshop you can actually lower your
temperatures on your GPU by a pretty
significant margin which he's done a lot
of videos on and the problem is that
pretty much every GPU comes apart and
goes back together a little bit
differently and has its own intricacies
so having somewhere where you can do
this because it takes a couple hours if
you've never done it before in a
supervised environment with someone that
you trust there you know what there's
still a chance that something will go
wrong but the odds are much slimmer and
so hey if you want to if you want to
learn how if for no reason other than to
just learn how and know your hardware
better is this another bring your own
situation oh yes we should probably do
the waiver thing for anything that
people bring their own of yes duly noted
yeah PC building workshop the complete
process so we want 10 to 15 stations set
up with a teacher and a few helpers to
guide people through so we're probably
gonna lean on our community members
actually just go and show description'
volunteers we are gonna take volunteers
I'm not sure exactly how we're gonna
handle the volunteer nosov it that's
something that Colton and staff are
figuring out challenges there's actually
there's gonna be so much cool stuff and
Lt I'm like really excited I actually
went through it was on this laptop and I
did I did up oh here it is here's the
folder I did up concepts for like what I
want a bunch of the go legal way hey
we'll go away okay I did up concepts for
what I want a bunch of the booths to
look like oh you made these well it
looks so much better in tiny thumbnail
form yeah so this is this is like a
stage these are just like tables for the
booth this is like the cable management
Oh challenge yeah yeah so it's gonna be
a timed challenge I want it to look kind
of crazy kind of like this anyway so I
did up a bunch of these like sort of
mock-ups and I'm like really really
excited because we want to get away from
the sort of elementary school science
fair look yeah we had going on last year
with just standard pipe and drape for
everything
stuff is still gonna be pipe and drape
like the VR booth yeah you're in VR the
VR booth didn't even have pipe and drape
last I know so it's still getting an
upgrade don't worry but so here we go
what else we got there we go
desk setup challenge whoever can build
the sickest desk set up with the parts
we provide within the time limit wins a
prize so it's gonna be like you're gonna
have desks chairs look knickknacks and
accessories wall hangings like all kinds
of things and then you basically have to
like do your setup as aesthetic as you
can get it snap a selfie with it and
then you're entered to win a prize cool
just like just fun stuff and very cool
how blindfolded table management is
gonna be back teams of two one person
guides the other who is blindfolded and
we're gonna have a ton more stations the
case toss is going to be back and fairer
so we are going to pallet wrap the cases
so they don't get lighter over the rest
of the day ah yeah that's good idea to
get idea the ltte editing den think you
can do it better we're gonna have
stations set up with footage on them for
people to edit an LTT video within a
specific time frame participants will
win a prize and we'll have a grand prize
for whoever does it best that's cool is
it like a short version of a video cuz I
don't know can it'll probably be shorter
rich yeah house of cards slash
motherboards how high can you stack
motherboards the top people for the days
will win prizes probably motherboards
yeah
minesweeper competition will be back
props to those who spent almost the
entirety of last year trying to beat the
records we're gonna have I'm a much
expanded booth for this and even more
ridiculous prizes for those who can top
the leaderboards nice guess that
motherboard we're gonna have a wall of
painted motherboards guess a certain
number of them created one you can win a
prize games a retro console gaming area
board game lounge area so you can just
chill and stuff and of course the
Dreamhack BYOC and Dreamhack free play
displays system showcases sis partners
enthusiasts modders we're gonna have
whatever cool stuff we can get there ten
years of PCs this one is gonna be fun so
we're gonna build a state-of-the-art PC
for every year from 2009 to 2015
like kind of the Quintus
seneschal game for me here running on
each one of them no I am we're just
gonna hand of have them there for people
to check out and enjoy so we're gonna
have to hit you a pretty hard for that
stuff but that's something that we're
gonna do as a video ahead of time I was
gonna say yeah is that one view so we're
getting it'll have to be I mean look so
okay
the idea with LTX this year is that even
if it costs us a whack of money - Media
Group doesn't really do like marketing
and we don't hit up like the charity
streams that hard or any of those kind
of typical ways of giving back to the
community and so the way that I see it
here is that
LTX is sort of our chance to just go you
know what community let's just put on
like a giant party yeah so I'm sort of
past making money on it at this point
cool if we can make money on it in the
future hey great like obviously this is
I'm running a business here that's not a
bad thing I'm not gonna say no no please
no money but like this is like a sort of
like a loss leader this year the
intention is if you show up at LTX we're
gonna have done our darndest to make it
freakin awesome a crazy fun experience
you know I'm not gonna say money is no
object but there is I'm probably gonna
end up spending about a quarter million
dollars on it so like it's not gonna be
cheap let's have a lot of fun I don't
expect to get that back okay I hope to
get some of it but this is like in the
in the past years I think we we we held
back a little bit because we were trying
to we're trying to do our usual thing
and like everything sustainable if we if
we need to have a breakout year this is
probably the year to do it I think so
teaming with Dreamhack moving to a
bigger venue a bunch of creators saw it
last year and want to come back yeah
this is this is probably the time and
you know what if we kind of go well that
was crazy and like people didn't even
care that much oops and then we can
always dial it back for the next year
and do a smaller more intimate thing or
whatever like LTX and you might you
might even certain booths like maybe we
need to double the VR booth again or
maybe it needs to be half this
or whatever but we can like adjust from
there there isn't that many conventions
that I know of at least where the
convention hosts are setting up a whole
bunch of the booths usually they like to
get other people to pay them to put
booths it's because it's really
expensive yeah yeah the issue for us
though is that we we are gonna have some
partner stuff there like we've already
got some PC manufacturers that are gonna
pay to be there but it's not a lot just
real talk guys like it's not a lot it
doesn't really make a dent and it's we
don't want it to be all about that
anyway we want it to be fun for the
community first and then making money
second and Colton's like Colton's like
okay the fuel in the back that's a big
reversal reversal of direction cuz the
first two years I was like look the plan
is to make this thing sustainable and
and like you know build it build it slow
roll out Colton you have something to
say you can you can come on here and you
can come on here and say it the
microphones over here so so Colton and
staff are on point for LTX this year I'm
hyping it pretty good here so like
awesome it has to be amazing it's gonna
be sick but it will be it's gonna be
sick we're like giving it our all
like actually maybe not at all we're
giving it a lot of us a lot yeah yeah
like go big or go home like legitimately
like actually like the venue is how big
is the venue again it's like say 80,000
square feet that well that were taking
yeah yeah and we're gonna dream it yeah
we actually expanded it we actually had
initially like a this is like already
like double the size of last year and
then inline so today he's like no no we
need more we need more look on his knee
Vaughn's face when I was in that meeting
cuz just like there's another ballroom
right yeah book it well I'm not sure if
Dreamhack is down for that book it just
do it book it just do it yeah it's just
good I don't I don't I don't want it to
be like I don't want people to walk in
and feel like they didn't try that hard
you don't want to necessarily have
completely blown the bank but you don't
want there to have been compromises
yeah I mean the thing is like
I feel like people really enjoyed the
last ones but it was mostly from just
like an engaging with us as a community
perspective and I just I felt like we
can do more yeah exactly there should be
more elements to it like it's not just
an upgrade I want people's one pluses
not to be bored
yeah and that's that's a tough thing to
do when it's just like when the main
attraction is like hanging out with the
LMG crew and the floatplane crew as it
were I'm talking about looking video
like oh I loved you in this video and
their Plus Ones like what Oh voice Scott
we're in sandals what is this
so yeah it smell good did you go through
the whole thing already not yet actually
I haven't even talked about one of the
things that Luke is gonna like make over
so it looks like there's a chance and we
basically when when this guy reached out
this guy's vintage PC collection is nuts
like go check his channel out I was I
was like point is his vintage piece
inflection is insane and as soon as this
guy reached out I was like Colton you
cover this man's travel you cover this
man's transportation for collision props
to him he's like I'll bring everything
I'm gonna bring all of it everything the
guy's got like so many different pieces
and stuff like that so so just even just
looking at his channel just the
thumbnails on his channel it's like oh
wow yeah so so so basically we've just
kind of gone okay here's like thousands
of dollars worth of booth space here's
thousands of dollars worth of expense
transporting all the stuff we don't even
care just just just do it come on up
here like it we want it to be really
really community driven really
collaborative really excited um which is
really cool the CNC demo is not
confirmed yet but we might have someone
with a CNC machine at the venue to
actually see and see stuff like for
people that's cool for attendees now
that might not be free that might be
something that you have to pay 10 bucks
for a box for I need to be small or
whatever it would have to be small
things but just what right yeah if you
want something cool to get signed
because a lot of people are one
like what should I bring a piece of
paper that's kind of boring like what do
I get to get signed yeah Dreamhack indie
dev sone sized TBD but there's lots of
Vancouver based indie devs charity
silent auction so we're gonna find a
bunch of cool stuff from the warehouse
and do a like probably BC Children's
Hospital or Extra Life or something like
that where's Luke scavenger hunt it'll
be more organized this time okay creator
Meetup area so there will be a dedicated
space where creators can get into and
out of it discreetly that was a big
problem last year is like when we had a
schedule time for people to hang out be
like that's a problem it like every
swarmed on the way - yeah formed on the
way from you can't get through the door
to main stage merch impromptu events and
more to calm what a blog posts I can't
tell you guys what anger when tickets
are going on sale yet we're still
working out things like the revenue
split with Dreamhack which as you can
imagine is a little bit complicated
because we have sort of different
visions for exactly you know what it is
like we're coming together from like the
perspective of like we really want to
work together and we're gonna make this
work but like we are very different
organisations with very different goals
so there's just there's some there's
some things to figure out but like both
our team and their team are super
dedicated to just making it happen and
it could be one of those things where
after this year we might go yeah you
know what that didn't really work that
great but that's not what we want we're
trying to build this as a sustainable
thing because I really cool keep this
going
I think Dreamhack adds a lot of street
cred there are a lot of value to the
event yeah and they feel like we add a
lot of street cred and a lot of value to
the event so like and like it's it's
such a really cool combo in terms of
like mixing the pieces because there's
different there's lands that have like a
hardware focus but it's not really the
same and yeah and there's well there
isn't actually really hardware
conventions but we did that sort of but
it didn't have the other side there's
creator focused if there's also that
there's Hardware focused ones there's
blaming focus ones there's LAN party
focused ones but us plus Dreamhack kind
of bring
we hope we hope that's what we're gonna
try and do yeah and you won't lose that
hardware focus because a lot of these
events like like original paksas I
remember one of the first paksas I went
to one entire wall of the convention was
all Nvidia the whole thing they rented
out the entire wall like if Nvidia shows
up yeah the the hardware focus is like
gone so it's cool that we have another
one of those two I don't know
I'm super excited we'll LTX 2019 be
live-streamed colton we got Hyrum Wow
why don't we why don't we roll the intro
cuz we never did that sometime like over
half an hour into the street whatever
minor
I wasn't sure I never know which we can
talk about that there will be a thing
it'll be a thing okay we'll figure out
how this split is like actually super
complicated it'll be a thing we'll
figure it out okay yes there will be
some kind of live streaming option now I
can't promise that we're gonna have like
a live feed of following me the whole
time or like a live feed following
around every single creator the whole
time with like eight different you know
l TX 1 l TX 2 l TX like be realistic so
there will be there will be hopefully a
live stream of the vast majority of the
stage stuff and then I believe we are
intending to broadcast the land show
live from l TX and that one will be
available to everyone but it is probable
highly probable that things like panels
will be limited to people with a virtual
ticket similar to what's been done at
other kinds of events in the past again
we are putting a lot of money into this
and we we don't expect all of it back
but we also we don't like just putting
it in a fire for lols so don't explain
how the virtual ticket will work we
don't know that yet okay
yeah it's I mean you know we have a
really close partnership with floatplane
media so there's a strong possibility
that it'll have something to do with
floatplane yeah yeah I guess I guess
it's it's not all like in writing yet so
no so we can't get into too many details
we're gonna work it out with we're gonna
work it out with floatplane media those
guys I mean they're not like Dreamhack
we're like we really want to work with
them you know they're just kind of
they're just they're they're just
they're they're actually like always
there they're a pretty adequate video
service is that what it's pretty
adequate for no it's just adequate video
yeah we actually own the domain adequate
video service comm so I was joking to
Luke that we should further for the
people who like to who like to dig
around in the nuts and bolts of like
video players that should be like our
back-end delivery and then when you go
to like adequate video service calm it
should just redirect to something like
could you set it so it's just like a
Russian Roulette of redirection it's
there I don't know why oh oh speaking of
that we still do need to make money in
the flow plane chad is like full plane
media aren't they like an indie upstart
or something yeah honey hey head over to
join honey dot-com / Linus and start
saving today you've probably heard us
talk about honey the free browser
extension that helps you save money on
popular sites like Amazon if you heard
of Amazon before yeah I think they're
there it's kinda like a jungle like sell
books oh I thought Walt that's so funny
I was watching this thing it was like I
forget what the like 1997 like thing
about Jeff Bezos and I was like oh right
a bookstore anyway do you saw the one we
had like a door as a desk yeah yeah yeah
it's actually really good yeah I'm like
the host is like that's a bit weird
anyway as you shop on sites like Amazon
honey automatically compares the prices
of millions of sellers that carry the
item that you want
they even factor in shipping cost sales
tax and Amazon Prime status to make sure
you always get the lowest total price
and the coolest thing about honey is
that you don't have to pay for it it's
for free they get their commission from
the sellers rather than from you so head
over to honey calm / - we're gonna have

like professional I think you've done a
PA a spot in a while I can dial it back
little and savage Turkey brought to you
by boho flavor I don't need this Turkey
but I'm gonna eat it Luke is dead like
an open-air warehouse you know we've got
like thousands of cubic feet of air
space here oh man savage jerky is made
of high-quality ingredients without
nitrates or preservatives with the goal
of leaving a snack that's full of flavor
and spice but that isn't bad for you
it's also handmade
what are their flavors the Moho premium
jerky is one of the Thema stin their
lineup in terms of heat but it's just
really flavorful it's got lime cilantro
garlic cumin and it helps bring out that
fantastic beef flavor you guys can use
offer code ltte to save 10% on all their
products over at Savage jerky dot-com I
still recommend the maple buffalo bacon
sure we have some right now mo-mo help
you know I thought they were getting you
like a crate or something I don't know
maybe for like LT extra someone in a
floatplane chat was like most
professional CEO 2019
heck yeah it was good should we talk
about a topic um yeah no yeah let's do
that Chrome to break ad blocker so the
original article here is from the
register right after edge decides to
switch to chromium you know isn't that
funny timing I think that's very funny
timing very unexpected Oh edge switches
to chrome and Google says you know what
chromium we're just gonna block ad
blockers you know it's just funny
because is it Google's business serving
ads online now look I don't wear a
tinfoil hat but I have to say I think
this is a very stunning coincidence
this should be your version of while so
Kyle goes to the Asian estai yeah I go
to the whitest guy basically oh so if
we're to believe Google about this oh
yeah chats blowing up go go team Firefox
if only Firefox wasn't trapped right now
right what okay I used to I had a
Firefox plushie thing you had a Firefox
hard-on so big that sometimes we
couldn't get this table to sit level
yeah like if we talked about Firefox
would be like what well from his side
though I used it but I wasn't like Oh
Firefox yeah I did like wild amounts of
testing I had some like run really
really enjoyable nights with Firefox but
the problem came down to when it would
crash so much that it was directly
negatively impacting my work yeah that's
where the lion was kind of drunk that's
when he switched to chrome was not until
like host lmg like two years in yeah and
like I I stopped doing the nightly stuff
on on computers that I did work stuff on
which was all my computers but like I
stopped doing the nightly stuff I I
brought it back I started doing the
consumer builds when I was like okay I
can't handle this anymore but for a long
time even on the nightly builds it was
wrong
on the right Oh on the night yeah no I
know knightly but I was usually on beta
yeah and what it was a long time and
like magic we aren't crash every once in
a blue moon yeah you're like I'm on the
beta one that's fine I send in my crash
report and try to be helpful and then
I'll bring everything back up it's fine
and people say quantum came up yeah
quantum came out and I like on stream
was like let's do it and switched to
quantum and was like I'm really excited
I'm coming back and then there that same
day within a couple hours of using the
browser just completely locked up and I
had lost it I was like no I can't
I wore so much stuff as browser based
these days like so here's the thing
according to Google they're doing this
for do I understand this correctly
improvements to security privacy
performance and yeah sure to enhance
user control you know what I think I
think this really does help with user
control whenever we want to improve user
control at my company we just lock out
options we just take control away so
ridiculous of their same security and
fryer enhancing our control of the user
user should have increased control over
their extension the design document says
go ahead please finish that sentence and
users should be able to determine what
information is available to an extension
and be able to control that privilege
okay so this involves to achieve these
goals they want to replace web requests
the web request API with a new one
declarative net request and the web
request API is what allows browser
extensions to intercept network requests
so they can be blocked modified or
redirected so this can cause delays in
webpage loading because Chrome has to
wait for the extension okay we're good
fair enough so in the future web
requests will only be able to read
Network requests not modify them the
declarative net request will allow
Chrome or rather extensions to decide
how to handle network requests thereby
removing the mechanism used by some ad
blockers so interestingly this isn't in
my notes so I might get it wrong so
please feel free to correct me chat if
I'm wrong here but interestingly adblock
plus which is the one
kind of plays ball with the ad servers
looks to not be affected by this change
however you know what's really
interesting so I love Google as much as
anyone whose entire livelihood is but
you know what I really don't think they
actually have their users best interests
at heart here no with all of that Thanks
okay so the sorry the yeah go ahead
biggest problem that I have with it
personally is the improved security and
privacy thing yeah I mean if you're
gonna just if you're gonna do it just be
open about it yeah that's my issue yeah
and like my problem is now people are
gonna think that having an ad blocker
reduces your security privacy when it's
like literally the other way around
because the issue here is that it's not
like I don't support organizations
getting paid through ads absolutely work
they do online hello and like I it bugs
me slightly internally when people run
adblock on the forum because all our ads
on the forum are like as clean as you
could possibly have them and it's like
actually a really good experience it's
like actually not a problem there's no
video ones they're all groomed like
everything's fine this is a P ia that we
put up
there's nothing funky going on with it
like everything so nothing there's like
promotion for like okay tech linked
videos and like l TT videos and stuff
like that's actually it don't click on
the thread no I can click on this yes
but not on a thread yeah because you're
on your admin yeah I know see what's in
so we've got like one new egg banner oh
heavens and it's and one amazon banner
at the bottom and those are all fine
so like it kind of makes me say ad when
people turn that off because we do need
to don't even do like the top one that
everyone does know a lot of people
through tough ones that are like half
your screen yeah yeah so like I totally
understand why you want it on on some
websites I know yeah ingor imager
whatever has had a lot of malicious ads
on their site and there are a lot of
malicious ads out there that have like
totally injections and like all this
other like terrible stuff or that
usually understand what you might attack
who you are
yeah like
one really good one is logging your IP
when you click on an image so that you
can be exploited later like it's just
yeah like there there are terrible
things that ads do I completely
understand why you would want an ad
blocker I do wish it was certain
websites were white listed sometimes but
like saying that your security is
improved by removing ad blockers is
asinine because there are tons of
security problems that come with
malicious ads that are all over them so
like if Google were to just say we're
doing this because a big part of our
business is serving ads online and quite
frankly we think people blocking ads
sucks then I'd be like okay fine
honestly I can kind of get behind that
this will reopen the browser wars but
anyways yeah that's a good thing yeah
but they're not doing that no I'll bet
reopens the browser Wars anyways in
other fascinating news the lawsuit
against AMD for allegedly
misrepresenting how many cores their
processor has has been allowed to
continue so those of you who remember
bulldozer port bulldozer will also
remember that each module had two
integer processors and then one shared
floating-point scheduler so basically in
a traditional sense you'd have both an
integer unit and a floating-point unit
per core but AMD was sharing their
floating-point resources between two
integer units or whatever the ratio was
bla bla bla bla bla bla bla anyway the
point is that a lot of the time the the
line between what makes an individual
core and what makes to coerce has been a
little bit blurry because in the old
days you wouldn't have things like a
shared cache between two cores but but
now you do so AMD said it was going to
share instruction fetch and decode
stages floating-point units and the
level two cache between two cores and
then bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
so someone pointed out the best to come
the company is saying its own integer
execution pipeline qualifies as a core
if only because most processor workloads
emphasize integer math so that's why
they figured having two integer unit
made it to course even though they were
sharing components that would have
traditionally and indeed have continued
to be seen as necessary for a single
processor core so there's a class-action
lawsuit that's probably not going
anywhere for being honest
where people are saying AMD mislead the
public so calling calling it and there
FX processors eight core CPUs because of
the shared resources between cores and
bulldozer modules the lawsuit alleges of
the claim was deceptive about real-world
performance the issue here is that
saying how many cores a CPU has doesn't
say anything about real-world
performance what are you gonna go
complain that an atom processor with 4
cores is deceptive about its real-world
performance no it's still an atom
processor and AMD bulldozer course to
hear crappy cores like if you read if
you looked at any benchmark ever you'd
know that although for some reason AMD
fanboys were like they had like this
amazing blind spot it looked a little
something like this
look at this 2 workloads and it's really
good at it happens like every time
though and it's so funny because they
come after me they're like oh yeah now
that rise and so you're like now you're
on the AMD D because you know and you're
worried you were I didn't tell fanboy
now you're this like no 64 it's because
the situation changed yeah there's no
such thing as being on a team or not on
a team it's a processor get the better
one who cares gets up better one uh
anyway I'm probably not going anywhere
the judge did reject Amy's request to
dismiss the lawsuit so it'll proceed but
it's not it's not going anywhere
um Facebook got caught writing fake FS
on reviews for the portal kind of silly
apparently employees recalled leaving
five star reviews on Amazon for the
portal video chat device New York Times
reporters notice reviews for being left
by people with the same names as
Facebook employees and apparently
Facebook was it Facebook employees had
not been as the Facebook says employees
had not been instructed to leave good
reviews and they are asking them to take
them down so sure
boy can they do anything right lately
it's like having you know what else
they're doing there yeah yeah messaging
integration is that what you're know oh
they're integrating Instagram whatsapp
and facebook Messenger into one
messaging service we're gonna leave them
alone good idea seems like a terrible
idea
yeah I don't think WhatsApp users are
gonna enjoy that remotely half the
reason that people are on Instagram is
cuz they don't want to hear from their
grandma on Facebook Messenger but no you
will they will be inter compatible
according to tech link I think that's
gonna really hurt Instagram yeah I think
so dude although I guess you could
probably have like non linked accounts
you know but still
oof that's not a great idea there's some
other Facebook news apparently
Zuckerberg did something terrible again
I don't remember what it is though and
it's not in here okay well I've had
enough oh there's a reminder in here for
me to read some super chats can we
please get PewDiePie on floatplane it
would be free marketing for you trust me
we'd love we'd love to
I have never even met Felix let alone
pitched him coming on floatplane so yeah
best of luck to you with that x-man
Thank You van hunter says also my
profile pic was the first PC I ever
built six to seven years ago with your
help I think I missed your first message
hunter but thank you what else we got
hunter oh hey I just wanna let you guys
know I'm going after a business
information system degree right now
because years ago you guys created a
passion in tech for me so here is 10
bucks for being awesome well thank you
Drake says wife and I are thinking of
coming up from the states to LTX but I
need a dinner recommendation to make up
for dragging her along I've seen
Stephanie's post about places to visit

worst person to ask about like where to
go sorry oh yeah you can go to banana

seafood if you're ambitious amazing
you're in Richmond and you like barbecue
go to hog shack race geek birds hello I
have a new PC I'm struggling with my
recording this doesn't matter what I do
to bitrate it still gets choppy footage
ninety nine hundred K with a ten seventy
TI encoding speed yeah even even no
matter what your CPU is you can't go
like slowest yeah so just try it like
faster very I was just because it's not
working right now jumped a very fast
first and then try to dial it up from
there and see how it works
fake Dragonite says you can always count
on - to class up the show you didn't see
that
Sam says I tried shadow it has a long
way to go I can see it being useful for
cloud computing but they don't like it
for gaming just yet so that's a big your
mileage may vary thing down the street
it was great but I do think and they
acknowledge they have a lot more
infrastructure to build out Jake says at
least it'll be better than panic on
thanks literally husband yeah that's
true actually we did have we did follow
through on our ball pit commitment the
first year that was defeating tumblr con
David says hello from Nebraska yeah if
you have ever heard of it I've heard of
Nebraska the chick from Big Bang
Theory's from Nebraska okay yeah it's
just in the Americas I'll be flying out
there with the way for the for four days
first two for her last two for me
Brandon's turning our lights off also
says my wife is used to your voice uh
hassan sam says can't come to LTX but
want to support wow thank you uh Sam
thank you um
SoCo says love the show just turned 18
two hours ago happy birthday and already
having all kinds of existential crises
is this what adulthood is like oh you
ain't seen nothing yet wait till you
turn 30
yeah and I'm sure it gets worse McKell
says just wanted to say why did you open
the read for God's sake back cameras
like the value of my car please finish
that video we have a pretty expensive
car
yeah what a mean apparently our roast is
really good I actually haven't tried to
get a bunch of people tried it nice so
there's like an LT T roast that line
this hasn't tried but like everyone else
here okay so I opened the red to see
what would happen what do you people
want from me what were you really
expecting a different answer oh the best
part is because I forgot to do like a
before thermals test I have to put it
back together do a bunch of testing then
take it apart again then work on
measuring for blocks then put it back
together again probably to like test fit
then take it apart then like what
percentage chance do you think it'll
work at the end of it 40 I'm happy with
that as long as we get content out of it
at each stage along the way I think your
wife is gonna murder you if we don't uh
oh yeah we have uh we have to go to
badminton tonight don't we what time's
it start oh but we need dinner okay we
go okay bye everyone bye
