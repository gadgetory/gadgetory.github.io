my new tripod so this is a Manfrotto
something-or-other
can't remember what it is but we'll open
it up got really good reviews on the on
the online store that I bought it from
so I'm hoping that it's that it's
awesome it's also rated for the for the
weight of my new camera which is a Sony
fs700 which is right over there so this
will be part of the whole new setup for
line of tech tips I'm extremely excited
to bring to you now if you guys have
been following my channel for a long
time then you'll probably remember back
when I unboxed my Canon x8n camera when
we when we first upgraded from our
ancient Sony like tape camera that we
were using before that and then what
you'll probably also remember is that I
don't really know anything about about
AV equipment at all so me unboxing these
puts me a little bit out of my element
but it's okay because guys like Diesel
and cameraman wolf will help me and
actually better yet it won't help me at
all they'll just not make it so I don't
have to deal with it because I can
handle like SSDs and computer hardware
but when I get into this kind of stuff I
just get confused alright so it comes
with a carrying stack which is nice okay
it's like a kid in a candy store but
they're like diabetic so they can't eat
the candy but it's like still exciting
because you know it's a candy store and
there's lights and sound and you know
exciting stuff going on okay so there's
that so this is a kit it comes with blue
it comes with a fluid head as well as
the tripod unit it's all thing it's
rated for like 12 pounds or something
like that our cameras only
about eight pounds maybe I'm thinking
kilograms I don't know man okay it's
just yeah it's probably some kind of
feet on the bottom here that are making
it hard for me to get it in and out of
the bag there we go all right so there's
our there's our baller new tripod so
let's start with unlocking it which is
done like this it's got little locks on
here to make it so it doesn't just
randomly come apart so pin in that one
for some reason okay it's got little
rubber feet on here see that see that
texture and then you can okay these are
something I don't know what these are
for go ahead try to take this apart
somehow whoa and then everything's
coming apart now awesome this seems to
be some kind of like stabilization
doodad that involves this being actually
quite heavy and difficult to maneuver
when I hold it up like this all right
there we go okay so the stance is pretty
wide go ahead and put it right there and
then once we've oh yeah we're good we're
filming ah see you tomorrow okay again
click these and then I guess it will
extend for us oh there we go there we go
that's better
once we unclip those we can get a better
idea what kind of height we're going to
see with this thing because I thought
tripods are rated right to rated like in
terms of height more height is better
actually I don't know cameramen bring me
a look right now like I said I don't
know anything about this stuff I just
know it at the what the video folks say
we need in order to make like more
better videos and then I try and try and
make that happen okay so there's more
extension here oh okay
wow this thing is gonna get pretty big
indeed before we're done with it here
I'm gonna have to get this box out of
our way
look it's like growing it's like a
transformer or something
actually it's tripod but
okay so it's going to go to six foot
stance on the thing and it's uh yeah
about five that must be about five feet
tall so it comes with as I mentioned
I've got a kit so it comes with the
fluid head I forget what the part number
is but it's probably something fun part
number or other yeah I can find out for
you guys imagine more something
something something something
yeah it doesn't doesn't doesn't say
anything oh yeah mvh 502 a and then the
yeah so that's the pro video head cool
and then the tripod itself is the 545 or
the 546 B or something like that so
basically to mount it on here all we got
to do is slide this bad boy in so we
already took the the mounting piece out
and put it on the camera so you can hear
it clip into place there and then you
lock it in place using this guy right
here and then in theory doesn't go
anywhere also comes with one other
accessory and that's this piece right
here so we're just gonna you can mount
it on either side if you're a lefty then
I'm sorry and you can but you can still
use this product I'm just kidding I have
nothing against left-handed people
they're wonderful you know most of the
ones like that so there we go
this uh this probably has two no no
looks like this just freely moves oh
maybe it just isn't quite tight enough
yet now there we go so once you've
tightened it in place to tightened it
locked it in place this way then you
keep going a little bit further and the
handle itself locks into place you can
adjust the fluidity the drag system here
as well as here so you can either set
lots of resistance or very little
resistance and then there's a level
right here to help you make sure that
well your camera tripod mount system is
level so there we have it we now have
our new camera mounted to our new tripod</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
