time but you don't necessarily want
people knowing about what you watch
while wasting Kleenex polishing your
trophy so what can you do if you're
streaming online you can always use
private browsing but there's ways to
attract your activities in spite of that
and if your preferred medium is locally
stored on your computer there are many
dangers there as well
so in this video we'll show you ways to
keep your sausage flicking material
private whether you stream your content
or watch it locally give the video like
if you want to see us test how modern
hardware plays old hardcore games like
Crysis 1 and Witcher 1
so I'm sure a horde of chicken chokers
are going to comment about how they will
run their browser in private mode
whenever they want to watch content
while peeling their bananas and their
right to a certain degree in today's day
and age streaming your content or
holding physical pictures documents or
even video in say a cloud storage
account is often the best way to go if
you're trying to hide it from friends
and family because it largely keeps the
data off your computer but it isn't
perfect there are a number of ways to
track this however like key loggers
stealthy background applications that
can record your typing and transmit it
externally to someone else and packet
sniffers like Wireshark that analyze
your network traffic now to be fair
these things could only really be in
place if someone with a fair amount of
technical prowess had access to your
computer or your network but it's
something to consider nonetheless
competitors rather simple you can just
run a VPN encrypting your traffic but if
someone has direct access to your
computer for almost any period of time
they could easily install something like
a key logger or in the event that your
carelessness left your incognito browser
window open simply look at your screen
and see what you'd been up to so how do
you avoid all that without being obvious
and paranoid about people touching your
computer here's a cool idea use a
separate device for that a laptop tablet
phone or even desktop can all be used
and if you follow our three tenets when
it comes to said device you shouldn't
have any problems it should be one fast
to access to anonymous by logging in
with throwaway accounts and using a VPN
and three private through physically
hiding it by the way we don't really
recommend under the mattress it's kind
of obvious it's from these principles
that we derive our names for these
devices laptops tablets phones and
fooders now onto local storage
Protection stage one of this is to just
hide it but it's somewhere people don't
commonly go like system folders or app
data another simple way to do this is to
just technically hide it go into folder
properties and click the hidden checkbox
but as many of you know this is still
very easy to find so another minor step
that you can make is to make it
invisible by going into properties
making its folder icon blank then read
naming it to blank by holding alt and
then typing 0-1-6-0
what this does is it removes the name
and the icon for the folder or file the
problem with that is that it leaves a
blank spot which may actually stand out
more than a clever name and
realistically people can still find
these pretty easily if they're looking
for them
you can go through the process of
changing the extensions and names for
all your files through a batch process
but that's frustrating doesn't
completely protect them anyways and it's
time-consuming which is a violation of
our fast to access tenant but there's
more that can be done beyond simple
smoke and mirrors misdirection first up
is encryption which is a way of using a
tool to require password access to the
files or folders that you mark for
protection compression tools like 7-zip
can encrypt archives or if you want
something with more options than that
you can use TrueCrypt 7.1 a yes the true
crypt project was more or less abandoned
but research into the code continues
from the Gibson Research Corporation who
insist that true crypt is actually still
safe to use and through two phases of an
audit still have not found any
significant cryptographic problems next
is the method of using a virtual machine
a completely separate operating system
running from within a host operating
system this is still susceptible to
certain key loggers and packet sniffers
but as long as you have a habit of
shutting down your virtual machine when
you walk away to the bathroom it can't
hurt one issue with both encryption and
virtual machines is that if the
individual searching for your files is
familiar with tools like space sniffer
and windirstat they can easily see the
large single files associated with
virtual drives and encrypted folders so
next is a form of physical security this
would keep your data on a storage device
that isn't always attached to your
computer either a flash drive that you
can easily hide these are available in
astonishing capacities these days and
can be encrypted as well or an internal
storage device like a hard drive that
sits inside your computer and is just
usually unplugged the hard drive
solution can be quite easy to do if you
mix it with the hot-swap feature which
is probably found on your motherboard
which allows you to hot-swap SATA
devices while your computer is running
this would result in the awesome
situation of having the
data be impossible to find unless
someone plugs in an internal drive which
is pretty sneaky so whatever your
preferred method of content consumption
while whacking your meat there's some
way to help hide it if you feel you need
to and of course most of these methods
can be used for any type of file so
whatever you're into I'm sure there's
some way to accommodate that thanks for
