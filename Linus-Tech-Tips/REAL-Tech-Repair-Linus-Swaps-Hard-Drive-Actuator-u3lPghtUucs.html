this we're here at Dr savers these guys
they recover data off of drives phones
the clean rooms over here basically if
it's got data on it these guys recover
it and they turn to me they're like look
we know you're not here for very long
but I mean we don't normally do this as
part of the toilet do you want to get do
you want to get suited up and you want
to rip apart our hard drive and do an
actuator swap it in a real hard drive in
a real clean room and I'm like what kind
of stupid question is that
that's like asking me if I want to tell
you about synergy synergy to makes
sharing one Mouse and one keyboard
between multiple computers so simple and
seamless that anyone can use it check it
out now and learn more at the link in
the video description
I'm trying to dictate we're making a
face okay you know I'm just gonna you're
gonna be a nice nice new tumor so inside
here it's certified to be less than a
hundred thousand point one micron
particles per cubic meter of air so it's
like ten thousand times cleaner regulars
oh this is hot here we go
well that's a heavy door so the whole
room is positively pressurized they've
got I think it's thirty five fans
running pushing air constantly downward
look at that look at this stuff SSD PCB
you know no big deal it's freaking crazy
one and a half terabyte forensic one
terabyte target two terabyte targets
dang this place is big hi I actually
don't know where I'm going
cool this is this my station it's good
at pure sake
yes sick
thank you is this like a special
cleanroom chair boy I'm okay
it's really slippery okay
maybe your suits like better than mine
but like I'm serious okay hello okay so
yeah this guy can't even sit in a chair
how is he gonna fix a hard trip look
some of us don't do data recovery every
day okay he's like this is the most
boring part like if I bleed in here is
that a contamination problem in here the
theory is that it is so clean that I
don't need to seal the drive back up is
that right like can I just run it open
correct
can we run this one without the lid on
just to show it doing it we cannot we
cannot really it just has like a sensor
or something no one has a little nub on
the lid interesting so it's not just
it's not just a pretty face it's so the
lid is actually functional Wow so it
actually holds the entire actuator
assembly well it down Oh interesting so
check this out so you've actually got
four read/write heads because each of
these platters can store data on both
sides here what else can we say about
this so so this guy right here holds
these in place when it's off so the read
and write heads actually like are
basically like they're flying over these
spinning platters and these are going to
you know up to 7200 rpm these days they
used to go higher in some cases but on
consumer drive these goes up to 7,200
rpm and it's basically like that like a
fly flying around in a hurricane like 12
inches off the ground like it's like
it's stupid so any time you're not
actively reading or writing data you
want them like out of the way because if
these contact there then you gotta send
your drive to drive savers
Tereus and anything they touched you
think you ain't getting that back
actually that's one of the scenarios
where you might have to do what we're
about to do which is an actuator swap
where if it accidentally makes contact
the metal shards inside are so damaging
that they could just tear apart these
tiny fragile heads okay hit me with the
next step
oh it doesn't say do not eat on it but
that is definitely desiccant and you
definitely shouldn't eat it you should
need anything in a hard drive this is my
hands are shaking
that's as steady as I could hold it I'll
just get some two-handed assistance in
there thank you all I would have to do
is drop this screw conveniently
nonferrous oh probably for a reason
there's magnets in here duh do people
typically get this right on their first
try cool all right well I'm excited then
I want to do it you can pop that up yep
okay yeah whoa yeah you can really feel
it like when you wear like snaps into
place there okay and the stopper is this
black guy right here right okay right
there without a fall off yeah and get
this
yeah keep the head separated which is a
version of this that we had made
in-house ourselves very cool so we're
you want to keep that slide that between
there and try to get that in your batter
zone did I kill it
not yet I know okay is it probably dead
now first okay
doesn't matter which way you go no they
touched yeah I am sweating up a storm in
here this is so stressful so you're not
putting the bottom one in one no you're
the bottom one is on the very bottom oh
no I didn't yeah I didn't get that I
thought they all had to go in one that's
why okay well if you're guys this goal
was to make this look hard and like we
should let professionals do it then
mission accomplished I suppose sure
whatever no problem can I have a fire
suit I'm weak yeah I gotta switch hands
I didn't think this through okay
okay if I just wanted to know for sure
if I killed it could be try it I could
tell you right now that we did oh I see
the head ii fit tip with the head right
here at fit which is a piece of upwards
like this so they should go you flat out
this way right now it's really flat
between you got it coming up like this
here have a look at that fell that's the
bottom one it curls up a bit girls up
what that's gonna do okay good drive
right now it's gonna scratch up the
bottom pull it on the bottom platter for
the bottom platter on 5-0 so now when we
started this video the intent was to
just take a platter out of a working
drive put it back in and demonstrate
that it still worked what we're ending
up with is that in order to fix this
drive we need a donor drive because this
is actually a very common failure I mean
not an idiot opening your drive and
bending your red head and right head or
whatever but just just a platter crash
failed actuator assembly thank you and
I'm gonna try this again but like super
more carefully this time and I know how
the combs work all right I'm gonna try
and be more organized about these this
time so this is step one I want to do it
right this time
I don't like failing it's tough so
you've done I was told over 50,000 of
these new trainees they got to do about
three thousand before they touch a
customer product at the live Wow okay oh
okay
doesn't that redundant if I put it here
yeah but you know what they're skipping
sorry I don't want to give the customer
back is wrong part
okay got it okay let me think hold on
this guy right no no oh shoot hold on
let me think oh no this guy right okay
man the pressures on I feel like this is
like you know the ninth inning of the
big game or whatever like I yeah now I
put on the comb right no oh crap okay
hold on
Jonathan I take these out first great
huh my arch nemesis we meet again mr.
Cole damn it hold on and I got to hold
this right while I do it
that one ah mr. comb we meet again oh my
god
okay now what on its side what does that
mean okay okay you watched it what do
you think are my odds come on you got
neither don't don't don't cheat me here
yeah give it to me out of 165 that's got
a high sixty-five is high oh well that's
not that good okay what'd I do wrong
specifically okay right oh man my hands
are still shaking like crazy I would say
I've never been more stressed to find
out if a hard drive works but I
definitely have anyone who's seen the
Wanek server video will know that it's
there okay so it's detective but that
doesn't tell us that much does it okay
Oh Andrews okay but would K work
theoretically yes right I would so let's
try it hey hey you learn something today
- hell yeah man Oh what do you guys
think
okay okay no cheating if you're gonna
leave a comment on the video guessing
whether I got it or not
you have to do it now you can't do it
after
that's cheating wait we didn't clean the
platters does that matter all the
waiting wait hey is that good good
that's good Green is good
we serve I Drive the total walk out
right here right into a terabyte target
yeah but so it took nine hours no well
we consider this a very good first step
very excellent for the physical aspect
everybody so we saw we've seen no even
pink so far no yellow head no yellow as
it yes oh yeah
wait did you sit oh okay yeah beer all
of that beer all of that so there you
have it guys we're only 0% of the way
through so you know it's hardly
completely conclusive but we are
tentatively calling the operation a
success which is really exciting is all
green so far however I do need to be
very clear that this was a best-case
scenario we had two working drives that
had never been opened before so even
though I personally broke the the heads
on one of them we knew that the rest of
it was good there was no firmware
corruption there was no media damage
there was no heat damage or whatever
else these guys might deal with on a on
a daily basis but I'm still really
excited about it and I'm still really
grateful that I got the opportunity to
