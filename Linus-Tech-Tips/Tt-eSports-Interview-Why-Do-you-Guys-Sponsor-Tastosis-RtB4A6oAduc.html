2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm now when it comes to
sponsorships tell me something why taste
OSIS ok so a lot of people know us in
the past were really involved with
starcraft like marine king why Ross and
all those like big name players but when
you really think about starcraft you
really think about the announcers you
think about people that are entertaining
you while you're watching the game
they're telling you how to feel about
the game they're telling you how to
think about the game you're you can
really relate to them on a personal
level because you feel like they're
having a conversation with you every day
that you're watching starcraft so who
else then to go with then the most
famous eSports personalities out there
tasteless and artosis so that was our
reasoning to approach them but at the
same time they were really eager to
develop personalized gaming products and
that's one thing that we really
specialize at TT eSports is being able
to make personalized gaming gear we have
a mouse and mousepad for white raw we
have a keyboard and mouse pad for prime
team and marine king so they've known
that we've done that in the past so they
were really excited to develop products
from the ground up in the design phase
and the testing phase to be able to make
the stuff that they really want to use
and that's something we're working with
them right now on now we actually
mentioned this in one of the episodes
that we did for NCIX if you're not
familiar with them it's canadian
retailer where i actually haven't had
that much familiarity with thermaltake
products in the past same with TT
esports and I picked up the white raw
mouse and I kind of went oh this is
actually designed for some dude's hand
because it doesn't fit me at all whereas
I feel like a lot of the time with these
gamer sponsored products it's just a
product that you then find a gamer to
sponsor whereas it really doesn't seem
like you guys do that so so which ones
would you say are the ones where it
really was designed for like that guy
and if you want to play like him and and
and use a tool like he uses you're
really getting that experience yeah a
lot a lot of companies or products in
the past have just used a pro gamers
face to stamp on the box and endorse it
where we really started developing
products on a personalized level is when
we started with the prime team keyboard
you can really see that marine Kings
design really went into that keyboard
it's bright red with pink keys he's
really well known for like wearing
really flamboyant clothing being like an
out their personality so that's when we
designed we sat down in a room with them
and I said okay here's the layout we're
going to be using tell me what's which
you want to use tell me what colors you
want to use and we'll make it even
though a lot of people don't like the
red and the black and the pink color
scheme is like whatever you want we will
make for you because that's the deal we
have with you so that's where we really
started and then even taking it to a
next level with taste OSIS i sent them
like the 3d drawings of the the mouse
design and our toast would say no I want
to change that so like two weeks later
sent him a new one no I won't change
that it's like okay well it keeps kind
of kidding pushed back but he's really
like he has a big emphasis on this has
to be perfect this has to be perfect if
you want me to sell this and so we
finally finished the design I got a 3d
printer in our office we printed out the
the model of the mouse sending it to him
next week to finally dig it get his
final approval so we could actually
start making them the mouse so yeah I
think it was started with the prime team
keyboard with a design and the color
scheme and then we took it to the next
level actually just starting from the
base just 3d designs 3d models let's get
to the really bare bones stuff before we
actually make the product a real a real
product that people can go out and buy
and use that's fantastic because it's
just totally different from what I see
other guys doing and it's one of those
things where everyone's afraid to make
that polarizing product that isn't you
know good for the masses I mean you know
how long it's been since I've
encountered a mouse as large as the
white raw mouse I was like oh someone
with big hands can actually Palm this
whereas you see everyone else hedging
their bets they build a palm mouse that
someone with bigger hands they expect
them to just claw it
and you guys just don't believe in that
I mean like I said earlier something for
everyone so if you want a big mouse
small mouse we have that I know
personally like artosis likes a small
Mouse we're developing a smaller claw
type mouse for him but we have you know
a big mouse for white raw sin our
Taiwanese star he uses a service mini
which is our really basic small mouse
design so we have something for everyone
you like a big small flats getting there
anymore I mean we could go we could go
there with that but we'll leave that to
another interview maybe we'll get why
wrong on that one do you have like a
like a private room that we could do
that interviewing well we got 33
interview rooms in the back but well we
won't talk about that do I need them
have a pole the hot tub all right thanks
