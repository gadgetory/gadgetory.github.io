requests this is the crosshair for
extreme and it contains all of the
latest technologies in fact some that
have been around for a while but just
took well a lot of months to actually be
implemented on anything this has the
hydrologic engine by lucid so what that
means is that you have support for oh
not only ATI CrossFireX
but also multi GPU support for mix and
match here up here so cross links 3
technology mix and match vendors and
cards and whatever else you could
possibly want to mix and match for
graphics cards so experience true
graphics freedom you can run 2 Radeon
cards you can run two geforce card you
can run a g-force and Radeon you can run
mismatched geforce cards or match
geforce cards it doesn't matter it's not
an SLI ready motherboard please note the
absence of an SLI logo this is an AMD
board with an AMD 890 FX chipset but you
can still run to geforce cards thanks to
the hydrologic chipset right there from
loosen okay it's a republic of gamers
port so you've got ROG connect so you
can plug in another computer and you can
make any changes to the system settings
that you could want to it has USB bios
flashback that would be really nice
actually that's a cool feature so you
just throw a USB with the BIOS on it you
plug it into the back and you boot up
and it restores it very cool you've got
oh yeah I believe that one is so that
you can use bluetooth to overclock
through your phone or something like
that so that's a pretty neat feature if
you're into that and 3dmark Vantage
Advanced Edition is included let's have
a look at the back of the box and see
what they have to say it's all of the
exact same stuff Wow
okay five PCIe 16x slots now we're gonna
have to have a look at the manual for a
change I know I don't think I've ever
actually shown you the manual for a
motherboard during an unboxing but we're
gonna have to do that to find out
exactly how the hydrologic and
splits up those PCI Express Lanes
because it actually acts as as an
intermediary between the chipset and the
graphics cards and that's how it
performs its magic where it takes two
mismatched cards and and takes the
performance of them and adds them
together and makes more performance so
let's have a look at the accessories
first we have what on earth is this
we'll be back in a moment this is a
Bluetooth riser card I got it figured
out
we have a USB cable for rog connect
we've got an i/o shield which is black
looks cool we have some temperature
probes very nice you have some cable
ties
we have cute connectors we have a
crossfire bridge we have voltage readout
little plugs and you plug those into the
board and then you plug your multimeter
into there and you can read the voltages
of a bunch of various aspects of the
board we have a firewire USB IO PCI
backplate you have one into these three
bags of two so that's a total of six
SATA 3 cables and then we have to say to
two cables please note those cables are
identical other than the color we have a
crosshair for extreme motherboard DVD
which you should throw away and download
the latest from the Zeus website and we
have labels for your SATA cables as well
as the manual so give me a moment I'm
gonna look this up in audio as you can
see this is a very complicated chart and
hold on cameraman don't move the camera
look at this paragraph so that if people
want to they can freeze the video and
read it don't move don't move don't zoom
steady unsteady hands government there
you go okay so basically what happens is
if you want to run crossfire just native
crossfire you use PCIe slots 1 &amp;amp; 3 okay
if you run want to run lucid Hydra okay
so that's ATI Nvidia or X which is mixed
multi-gpu mode then you can use any one
of these combinations here crossfire X
will also work with these columns with
these combinations but if you
run it natively is here depending where
you want to install your theoretical
raid card or other PCIe peripheral you
can get varying widths for the PCIe
lanes so you can get up to 16 X 16 X 16
X fourth triple VGA mode and then if you
want to run prod VGA you'll have to
settle for 16 16 8 and 8 so there you
have it let's keep going with this
unboxing and we'll have a look at the
board itself that is really like yeah I
don't know it throws a lot of it looks
like it probably threw a lot of
complications into the engineering
process I mean when you're figuring out
how to how to optimize you know which
ones are running off the bridge chip and
which ones are running natively off the
chipset and like all this stuff it's a
miracle they managed to make up words
like this at all actually and a high-end
one no less look at that okay so that is
a very very nice-looking board so why
don't we start with the general layout
the first thing we're gonna find on this
board is a CPU socket that's name three
socket compatible with the latest quad
core and six core CPUs from AMD up here
in the top left you will find an 8 pin
CPU power connector as well as a very
elaborate looking PWM and chipset
cooling solution so you can see there's
a heat pipe actually I'm gonna get you
to get a slightly different angle on
this first of all there's fins down here
and then there's thicker fins up here ok
so you can see the heat pipe is running
all the way through here down this way
under here over here and then down to
the South Bridge and that is actually
where the hydrologic tip resides if I
recall correctly let me have a look I
believe it is oh it could also be here
hmm this could be trouble
well not sure exactly where it is my
guess would be here though okay and you
can actually see there is a cooling fan
inside here as well and it is plugged in
right there so that is probably one of
the most complicated cooling solutions I
have seen on an assist board in a very
long time because it is an am-3 socket
board you
support for dual channel ddr3 memory up
to 16 gigs you've got on board Hey look
at that pour on Locker button that makes
it easy doesn't it then you've got start
reset as well as switches for all the
PCI Express slots you know what this can
be a lifesaver if you have water cooling
if you're using full cover blocks it's
almost impossible to remove one card and
not another one so if you're trying to
reach out to troubleshoot like a dead
card or anything like that this can like
seriously it's worth its weight in gold
you've got probit which is where you can
find out the voltages from a bunch of
different aspects of the board so you've
got a ground here you've got CPU PLL CPU
RAM Northbridge um you know a bunch of
other stuff too that's great you got a
bill button I think that's actually the
memo okay button okay and then we've got
our 24-pin power along the right-hand
edge of the board exactly where it
belongs then we have SATA and they're
specifically labeling these as optical
drive I guess that's because they're
SATA 2 because the other six ports are
actually SATA 3 six gigabit per second
ports all right let's keep going down
you can see we've got dual BIOS chips
here as well as a CMOS Clear button then
we have our front panel connectors a
couple of hmm a couple of USB headers
presumably okay so nine ten seven eight
okay and then I'm not sure what the
others are okay that's fine all four pin
fan connectors on this particular board
and there are quite a few of them and
then we've got a couple of auxiliary
molex connectors so there's one here one
up here over by that chipset so that
means if you're loading this up with
five GPUs I mean remember this this plug
here was not designed to provide that
much power through the slots on the
motherboard so a soos is gone ahead and
augmented it with a couple of additional
molex plug now if you're only running
one or two cards it's probably fine not
to plug these in but if you are loading
it up with five high power cards
definitely plug those into your power
supply let's go around and have a look
at the back of the board on the i/o
panel so we have a ps2 port which I
personally still like to see just
because sometimes USB keyboards can be a
little bit finicky
you're running an unstable overclock
we've got one two three four five six
USB 2.0 ports a CMOS clear optical audio
out that looks like a powered eSATA port
as well as a regular eSATA port we have
two USB 3.0 ports Gigabit Ethernet rog
connect and 7.1 analog audio out thank
you oh-ah
no no not thank you thank you I mean
thank you but also check this out so we
got our one two three these are our
normal ATX mounting holes but wait
there's more
this is not an e ATX board but because I
need to eat a export it would probably
be about here and would have one more
screw but it is actually wider than an
ATX board so bear that in mind if your
case is not a little bit wider it's not
going to fit this motherboard thank you
for checking out this unboxing and first
look and don't forget to subscribe to

this the lucid chip is here cameraman
and I work together this is a South
