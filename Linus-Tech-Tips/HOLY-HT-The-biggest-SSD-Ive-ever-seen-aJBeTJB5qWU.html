bothered me it seems like everyone else
gets high density high capacity storage
whether it's USB thumb drives that have
been available in capacities as big as
you know 256 gigs fairly cheaply for
years or even up to a terabyte if you
want to spring from of those Kingston
ones foams are all the way up to 128
gigs microSD cards I think are available
in like 256 gig at this point em SATA
SSDs I mean we're talking full-blown
SSDs are available in up to one terabyte
capacities so why is it that when it
comes to two and a half inch SSDs for
your full-size laptop or your desktop
we've been stuck at the same damn 1
terabyte capacity for so long with
Samsung only recently releasing a 2
terabyte SSD sold in today's video we're
going to be introducing two things
number one is the largest SSD that I
have ever had my hands on this is a 3.8
4 terabyte SSD and number 2 is a new
format inspired by this thing that we're
calling holy Sh
Tunnel Bear is the easy-to-use VPN
service that lets you browse the
Internet as though you're in one of 20
different countries check out the link
in the video description to learn more
and try it for free so I think the
appropriate way to start something like
this when you got like something really
cool and interesting and different is
with one of our classic unboxing so
let's go ahead and rip this baby open
and find out what exactly a 3.8 4
terabyte SSD looks like woah the answer
is that aside from the horrendous box
with the 3-year warranty policy thing in
it clearly designed for people who don't
care about the retail packaging exactly
the same as any other SSD I mean okay
sure you've got the 3.8 4 terabyte
capacity written on there there's
probably some other specs like there's
your power consumption so it consumes
about 4.1 watts of power when it's being
written to it's rated at 540 megabytes
per second read 480 megabytes per second
right and can handle ninety nine
thousand I ups when it comes to random
4k at a queue depth of 32 so that's
pretty respectable but only about 18,000
die ops and again that's 4k random and a
queue depth of 32 when it comes to
writes meaning that this is definitely a
reads optimize drive in terms of the
form factor if you check it out it's got
a standard SATA power standards SATA
data yes my friends everything that's
interesting about this drive pretty much
is under the hood so what we open it up
I don't know if I'll ever stop
appreciating the irony of these kits
being called iFixit when they let me use
one because I never use them to fix
anything and usually breaking stuff
whatever warranties are for chumps
anyway and if if I didn't open it up how
would I show you where all the magic
blue smoke gets gets held while the
drive is operating alright so first
thing you're going to notice a bunch of
flash chips actually not that many in
the context of how large the drive is
each one of these is about 480 gigabytes
of capacity wrap your freaking brain
around that and the way they achieve
that is in a couple of ways first of all
they are TLC flash which means that they
can store three bits per cell that gives
better capacity and lower cost per
capacity although you do trade off some
right endurance as well as right
performance and then the other one the
big one is the fact that they are using
Samsung's 3d v-nand with 32 layers a
flash memory stacked instead of just
relying on Moore's law to continue to
spread out all of those cells so that is
what has enabled them to deliver this
puppy both at a reasonable cost and in a
reasonable form factor but of course
there's more technology on board as well
so you're going to find a tantalum
capacitor on here that's going to allow
the cash to flush to the NAND chips in
the event of a sudden power loss as well
as well you won't be able to see it but
inside Samsung's proprietary controller
you'll find some ECC correction
technology as well as we're leveling
trim and all that good stuff that allows
the drive to perform as well as it does
and this is cool in spite of the fact
that it uses TLC flash this drive is
rated at a two million hour mean time
between failure and rated at 5,600
terabytes of total data written and
within its sort of useful lifespan so to
put that in perspective that would be
writing the entire capacity of this
drive 3.8 four terabytes per day for
four years every day before you would
use up what Samsung rates it at but
enough about that let's go ahead and
plug it into a bench and well if nothing
else find out if it still works
basically what I'm doing right now is
I'm demonstrating exactly how to not
benchmark an SSD and I'm going to copy a
file from my SSD on Tyrande so you can
see it's actually not going that fast
and the reason for that is that this SSD
is not designed for large contiguous
file transfers it is designed rather for
something more like
the application that we are going to be
using it for which is multiple users
hitting it for something like streaming
video all at the same time so these SSDs
are going to act as a read cache for our
video editors to edit video files off of
so they're going to be scrubbing back
and forth through video files they're
going to be asking it for this clip in
the next clip and then you know moving
through the timeline adding things
removing things and that is the kind of
workload that something like this is
great for where we will be writing video
clips to it that will actually be
reading them back many times for every
time that we write to them all right
Linus so a video about a drive the cool
things about which you can't really
demonstrate thumbs actually hold on
no there are some things I can
demonstrate and one of them is the sheer
data density of this so just for
comparison this is Intel 750 series nvme
SSD this is a 1.2 terabyte drive and
unlike that drive what Samsung has
managed to do here is within that 7
millimeter form factor so it'll fit in
pretty much any laptop or certainly any
desktop they have delivered 3.8 4
terabytes and that's pretty impressive
but you know micro SD cards right like
they're huge no no this is where it gets
really cool so this is as good as it
gets for a hard drive these days this is
almost as good as it gets for even
three-and-a-half inch hard drives now so
to put it in perspective this is about
half the capacity of this guy right here
very cool but not actually the coolest
thing about it the coolest thing about
this puppy is the cost per gigabyte and
you guys are like oh yeah I knew he was
coming to this eventually how much does
it cost so this guy right here is going
to set you back about 2,200 u.s. dollars
too much most of you are probably going
to go excuse me you're going to tell me
this is a value in terms of cost per
gigabyte
yeah actually because while I am NOT
here to tell you guys that you should
all run out and buy one of these today
so you can keep all your steam games on
one SSD
yay because most games loading times are
not even any faster on faster storage no
no where the cost per gigabyte benefit
comes in is in the sheer density of it
like in a data center application let's
say Netflix for example wants to roll
out you know racks on racks on racks of
new servers with you know all the latest
hey say for example cool movies that you
and all your friends want to watch well
rather than just the cost of this guy to
worry about is only about 55 cents per
gig which is pretty good especially
given like a few years ago we were
paying over a dollar there's more to
worry about than just this cost there's
the cost of the drive cage it sits in
the cost of the SATA controller that
controls that cage the cost of the CPU
that runs that system the cost of the
actual real estate inside a data center
that that server has to sit inside so if
you can double the amount of storage
that again someone like a video
streaming service can have per drive
sled you are going to have a whole lot
of folks saying shut up and take my
money and that is the most impressive
thing about this puppy but what's the
application to you you might ask well
right now not a whole lot like I said
I'm not recommending that you run out
and buy one of these although if you are
a baller then you could certainly do a
lot worse know the applicability to you
is that bleeding edge hardware like this
always starts in the enterprise space
and within whether it's 2 years or 10
years eventually makes its way down to
the consumer level so the fact that it's
finally started we finally have SSDs
that not only even on a density level
but also just on a sheer capacity level
are catching up to hard drives means
that that can't be that far away so this
is cool we've actually got a giveaway to
announce we've collaborated with rock at
makers of gaming peripherals to give
away not one not two not three not four
not five not six not seven but eight all
of their gaming mice so there's a couple
of different models and depending on how
you get drawn by the way you enter at
the link to the forum
the video description you can win either
a cairo which has a 2,000 DPI sensor up
to 4,000 stable with their overdrive
mode as well as a clean economic design
a soft touch service and a design that
is optimized for both right and
left-handed use or you could win
yourself a Cova
so that features their pro optic r6
sensor which is a 3500 DPI sensor which
can handle up to 7000 with their
overdrive mode it's got their a smart
cast intuitive button layout that
doubles the standard em1 and em2
functions it features two levels 16.8
million multi color illumination on the
scroll wheel and the mouse rim and that
one is designed to be ambidextrous as
well so head over to the link in the
video description and leave a comment on
the video saying hey thanks for Rocket
