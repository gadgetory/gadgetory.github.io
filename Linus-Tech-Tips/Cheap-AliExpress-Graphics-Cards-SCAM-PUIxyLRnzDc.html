they're finally here I thought Anthony
was just throwing money away buying
graphics cards on Aliexpress let's go
check these things out after I tell you
about today's sponsor be quiet dark rock
for and pro for near silent air coolers
feature wave contoured cooling fins and
easy top mounted installation learn more
through the links below ok so apparently
what we think we ordered is an Elsa BT X
1080 and a max Sun GTX 10 65 gig and
this is what we've got so why don't we
start with the one that has no box so
we've got Elsa on here that's actually
like molded so you know presumably
there's some kind of volume to this
production and then it's got a sticker
on the fan that says de Broglie or de
Broglie is but it doesn't sound very
good the board feels pretty heavy it's
got a lot of memory chips back here so
this seems somewhat credible but there's
no no recognizable part number anywhere
on it it's got what looks like a serial
and then a warranty void by a tear or a
damage and that's about it I gotta say
though this shroud is sketching me out a
little bit I haven't seen many 1080s
that are that sort of cheaply
constructed alright so we know already
that this one doesn't have five gigs of
memory because Nvidia doesn't make a gtx
1060 with five gigs of memory this is a
funny thing for me so max sun is using a
really cheap heatsink design on this
thing holy crow I haven't seen something
like this on a card above the like
hundred dollar price point in my memory
so you see even though it has all of
these aluminum fins this is just a what
is it like a caste design I'm gonna
check with Alex would this be cast
aluminum and you see how that the fins
don't go all the way through actually no
this was extruded extruded okay so his
theory is that it's actually extruded
and that makes a ton of sense because
then they just have this profile and
they'd have the aluminum just kind of
pushed through it and then they could
just slice off heat sinks like this and
then it's very little work to create
these little slices for air to pass
through and then these little spots
where they can throw in a couple of heat
pipes this is a very inefficient way of
cooling versus having fins that actually
pass all the way through so you've got a
lot more airflow there's nothing really
else about it that sets off warning
bells other than the plastic backplate
which will obviously not only serve no
purpose for cooling because even metal
ones don't do that but actually could
make it worse holy crap
this might actually have five gigs of
RAM what is a 160 bit bus am I mistaken
is there a 5 gig like like you know what
let's just all right so we've got
benchmarks run for our reference
founder's Edition GT X 1080 already
which means we can go ahead pull that
puppy off the bench here and throw on
the ELSA de Broglie how much less did we
actually pay I thought the idea was we
were supposed to find things that were
like cheap okay so 720 us for the 1080
okay they've got some kind of tape over
the SLI fingers why would they do that
and not like a like a temporary looking
tape like this doesn't look like it's
intended to be taken off these little
heatsink fins on the back don't actually
appear to be like attached to this
aluminium plate in any meaningful way so
I doubt sincerely that they're really
doing anything for cooling it does show
up as a GTX 1080 benchmarks almost done
and honestly everything here is
pretty good so far we haven't like power
throttled or anything like that so 65 51
average FPS of 49 how does that compare
to our founders edition Anthony our
founders edition did 65 76 okay so this
one is bang-on that's actually pretty
cool because compared to the overpriced
mining cards that were available at the
time even though we did pay a lot of
money for this thing and getting a
warranty for it would probably be a
pretty sketchy ordeal we at least did
save a significant amount of money spoil
it for me was there anything I was
supposed to notice that was bad about
this one that shroud is for a gtx 980ti
not a 1080 did they reuse the PCB as
well the PCB is for an NVIDIA GeForce
GTX 1080 founders Edition but then
they're just using a 980ti shroud on it
yeah okay our model numbers on the back
that coincide with an apple mac pro
geforce 7300 GT so it's not like it's
not a little sketchy but by and large we
got what we paid for
I consider that one a success all right
this one oops I am not quite as hopeful
about these fans are exactly as cheap as
the heatsink all the way and hold on
maybe they're not at no they're not as
bad as I thought it helped out okay you
stop that this is like an AMD card or
something I said okay no no don't don't
tell me don't tell me well I'm not sure
if I'm expecting it but we should see
performance similar to a GTX 1060 frame
rates look like about what I would
expect from a 1060 let's see what it is
it's actually showing up as 1065 gig
with memory running it 4 gigahertz so
that would be 8 effective so at 35 32
that's above 300 points less than we got
with our founders edition 1060 but every
piece of data we can find seems to
confirm that this is in fact a five gig
card so those of you who have heard us
rant on what was it the 1070 TI video
and at various points on the lan show
will be aware of how we feel around here
about manufacturers saying this is a
1060 it's got six gigs of ram and this
is a 10 63 gig but i hope by the way
it's actually also cut down in some ways
we don't like it but apparently they're
screwing around with this even more in
other regions okay so after some digging
what it looks like happened here is
Nvidia actually released a China
specific 5 gig version of the 1060 with
the only difference same number of CUDA
cores with the only difference being the
bus width and the amount of memory so it
performs as we saw fairly similarly to a
regular 1060 but what with the whole
global DRAM shortage and all that it
comes in at a lower price and it is
intended for internet cafes so this card
ended up accidentally on purpose on a
marketplace but it was actually for OAM
sales only to these kinds of land cafes
that are much more popular over there
than they are over here so once again we
actually got an OK value and the product
itself was legit so buying GPUs on
Aliexpress good idea bad idea we're
still not quite sure but it's it's not
obviously a complete scam so that's
actually better than I was expecting to
be perfectly honest with you

checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured from a source that we
definitely trust at the link in the
video description also down there
through merch store which has cool
shirts like this one and our community
forum which you should totally join well
that was fun now we've got a couple of
graphics cards that we bought that we
don't need so we'll probably have like
an eBay or Craigslist link under the
video at the end here if anyone actually
wants 7 5 gig 1060 or 1080 presumably
you'll get no warranty coverage
whatsoever so you know the thing about
mystery meat is it tastes best with a
