product that is truly unique I've never
seen anything that is exactly like this
this is an LG product I don't know
exactly what it's called it's the N 1 t1
this particular model so why don't we
call it that we'll call it the n1 t 1
and since I can't properly unbox it I'll
actually want to leave this on here
because that has some marketing
information that I can tell you about so
the N 1 T 1 is a network storage device
and I apologize for the box being open
already but this is a marketing sample
so it's kind of making the rounds and I
get to check it out now
ok so it has fast reads and writes
speeds okay it's a network storage
device you can email your file through
downloadable links you can use thumbnail
view check your images it's a print
server it's compatible with different
operating systems including Mac it can
be used as a torrent download server ok
has a simple and easy user interface a
virtual disk library to store and manage
all of your DVDs and CDs files that's
kind of cool
multiple user access time machine
support it's an iTunes server and it is
Energy Star 5 but that's not all
wait there's more ok so here on the
front you see that it is now capped like
when I peeled the stickers off the
shipping labels it tripped up all of the
all of the prints on the box so it's
gonna be very very difficult for me to
read this and show it to you at the same
time so here's what I'll do
yeah ok I'll just kind of sort of you
might be able to read it ok so its
network storage that's cool so it's got
gigabit ethernet here on the back ok so
you see that abd turn it right there
it's an external hard drive an optical
drive mini notebook friendly feature so
you can see right here it has a USB port
and it also has a ya wall USB port so it
also has a switch right here so you can
switch it from nass mode right there ok
let's see if I can get my camera to
focus good camera ok so you can go from
NASA mode to external optical drive you
can see right here at the front there is
an optical drive slot that you can put
optical media in ok and then you can
also switch it to external hard drive
mode so you can use that u.s.
B port to connect to a computer and use
it as an external storage drive or as an
external DVD and CD drive very cool so
it has a backup button right here it has
an eject button those are the two
buttons there here's a bunch of other
stuff it supports including UPnP okay
DLNA Time Machine we already talked
about public link and system backup okay
so full system file backup and restore
it has remote access via Internet which
is pretty handy for an ass and it's a
multimedia system so enjoy your
multimedia content through your ps3 or
to your TV or to your TV directly cool
all right here most of this we've talked
about already I believe and the back oh
that would have been easier to read
wouldn't have yes yes it would've so
let's open up this box and see what's
inside
in terms of accessories we've looked at
you you need a fair bit already okay
there's a USB cable what you will need
if you want to plug it in by a USB
there's a Gigabit Ethernet cable which
you will need if you want to plug it in
by a Gigabit Ethernet there is a power
cable which you will need if you want to
power the device and there's a bunch of
documentation which you will want to
read if you want to understand the
device last but not least there is a box
and in the box is a AC to
DC power converter if you want to power
the device properly and have it not blow
up okay so why don't we just have a
closer look at the nads external optical
drive external hard drive itself so it's
got what appears to be a 40 millimeter
fan here in the back that's gonna cool
down the hard drive inside it's got the
power switch here it's got that button
we already or the switch rather that we
already talked about has a Kensington
lock there's your USB port here's a
little holder for the cord so it doesn't
get so if it gets pulled on or anything
like that it's not gonna pull it right
out of the jack there's your Gigabit
Ethernet and LG rates this thing at 60
megabytes per second read and 40
megabytes per second writes there's an
LG logo on the side very nice very slick
and then as I mentioned before this is a
super multi drive so it's DVD CD reader
writer
okay there's your backup button there's
your eject button the data side goes
here if you're having trouble with which
way to put in the optical media and then
here is yet another summary of all of
the different certifications and stuff
that it supports which is also here the
top it's got a nice glossy black finish
on parts of it and then it's got a nice
glossy white finish on other parts thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
n1t one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
