because I'm currently at square one all
I have right now is a whole bunch of
awesome computer parts and 18 pounds of
amethyst crystals yep as you may have
seen I wasn't just going to have colored
light representing the inside of a geode
I want it to really feel like you're
looking inside of an actual geode that
happens to have some wicked looking
computer part and in order to make it
look like that I must build so without
further ado let's get to it
HP's new omen ex lineup comes equipped
with Intel seventh generation Core i7
processor check it out in the link in
the video description
hey yo homie G we filled in the computer
three first things first I should
probably see if this stuff is even going
to function I've had some of these
things for a while now and they've just
been kind of sitting here and I don't
even know if they work Wow so right off
the bat I need to actually like test all
the stuff I've been sourcing the things
for this computer for the greater part
of 2016 and now it's 2017 so I haven't
taken some of these things over there
boxes and so long that they have like
dust on them the first thing I'm going
to install into my Strix x99 gaming
motherboard is an i7 69 hundred k which
is going to be fantastic because I've
been struggling on my twitch stream for
a long time now with an i7 2600
and Windows 10 which don't really go
very well together I can barely stream
rocket League bring it bitch one of the
nice things about this motherboard too
isn't just that like it's a really
great-looking motherboard and it's going
to be a solid motherboard is this like
RGB header down at the bottom right here
not the easiest thing to see ever but I
can plug in my like cable mod RGB cables
into that and think all the lighting in
my system which is going to be rather
awesome considering the importance of
lighting in this film now I'm going to
install some RAM some clev memory I
really like this club craft stuff I
don't see very many people use it but I
just think it looks awesome
one thing that was pretty important when
I was picking all these computer parts
was that they looked nice but rather
minimalistic because I didn't want the
computer part to visibly take away from
the amethyst crystal I wanted them to
accent it so white lighting or having
lighting in general was rather important
and then the rest of it I basically just
wanted to black
I'm hoping I checked for compatibility
with the cooler I did this so long ago
that I don't remember but that's some
tall memory and this is a big cooler man
this looks amazing already if you ever
wanted to like stop a build partway
through and just be like it can say like
this now let's see if this cool is even
going to fit how am I supposed to open
and can't get Hey look at open I don't
want to break it so that's what they
want it to look like and in that
configuration it would definitely not
fit oh man okay okay hopefully my idea
for how this should go we'll make it fit
let's see come off fan oh my god maybe
not the mounting is in a weird spot I
think if this was in the middle it would
actually fit to the point where I might
need to take off like this entire black
section in order to make it fit for
those wondering why I would use an air
cooler and not just go water cooling the
rig is called Geodude
Geodude is a rock and Ground type in
Pokemon both of which are weak to water
at the same time I can't put water in
this build that wouldn't make any sense
at all he would take more than just
double damage from that it would be 4 X
the original damage of the water attack
there is no way that I would risk
Geodude I will make this work so I'm
modifying the cooler try to make the one
side shorter as you can hopefully see
you right there and hopefully that will
get over the ramp I do know right now
that these peopIe Paul so go too far out
ok so I think it's actually going to
work we've bent the heat pipe back
there's like dent in the heat pipe from
where I was pushing but I don't think we
actually ruptured anything I was able to
make the one side taller than the other
yeah like it gets over the RAM and it
doesn't really push the RAM over at all
so
now all I need to do is try to get this
guy to go back on here somewhat like
that so you can't tell that I screwed up
so it's like actually going to size up
pretty well what if we can get the fan
back in oh I did not think that would
work
hahahaha oh my gosh I can't believe this
is going on right now I've almost got
the cooler on bringing it lower lights
off I mean idiot head enforcer off a
stock that wasn't even planned or
scripted we just started selling the ham
it I spent so much you what there you go
so it works
everything's on I actually put freaking
thermal paste on at this time it looks
sort of horrible from this angle you can
totally tell that it's walked out but
when you'll actually be looking at it in
the case it looks fine now like two
hours later or finally continuing on
with trying to see if any of the
components even works great wonderful so
all of the rams installed the cpu is
installed the cooler is installed now I
just need to get a GPU on here plug
things into the power supply and make
sure that we can actually post
all right so power supply switch on time
where is the power switch here it is if
you're cooler fan spinning graphics card
fan spinning and then they turned off
because they're supposed to do that
power supply a fan did the same thing
I've got a monitor back here which is
not responding oh hey okay everything
does seem to be working moving on heli
now to put it in the cake there we go
hey it's upside-down oh I'm excited to
work with you again okay so I Oh tray I
remember that yeah I'll do that right
now okay so I'm swapping out the default
a suit strict logos I never checked the
manual on how to do this so hopefully
just tearing them off was the approved
method of removing them and I'm going to
put on black and silver ones that came
in the box because this goes really well
with my whole theme goddamn and just
never touch that again
all right into the computer we go let me
see what this looks like oh my god even
without all the drives and all of them
because crystals this thing already has
some weight - oh jeez this is going to
be one hell of a building I got rid of
the boring cars by cables and got this
plain brown box anyways
cable mob stuff hopefully it doesn't
spill everywhere oh my goodness okay so
I got a whole bunch of cable combs which
will come in use later for organizing
cables mainly that are behind the
motherboard tray
and I got a bunch of lighting strip the
cables that I went with by actually
collaborated with the forum mod team on
their design our purple silver black and
white in different variations depend on
which cable you have in the state of
cables are just purple it's a pretty
bright compared to the rest of the build
but I did want them to stand out a
little bit because they look beautiful
so I'm going to do like two more cable
runs just for the graphics cards but
everyone else needs to go for the day so
time-lapse mode engage plot a rough
night we had a lot of issues that's not
like six freaking hours cable managing
this thing and it's not as good as it
was but I'm kind of done with that now
so this is where we're going to be the
power supply was not that things were
bad it was showing LEDs on the
motherboard but I couldn't actually turn
the system on and it was troublesome to
figure out how I ended up swapping out
the powers by trying a different one
eating some pizza and working through it
figured out that it would be graphics
card cables I think they just weren't
seated well enough into the power supply
itself must have tugged on them or
something I'm not entirely sure but we
are up and operational now so it is time
to add the 18 pounds of amethyst
crystals the whole interesting part of
this entire build is slightly starting
and I've got a washing stone now that
they're all in the bath it's time to get
rid of the like caked on dust and grime
existing on basically all of them from
lingering impurities and the grinding
against each other that happened in
shipping and storage for so long I'm
going to use some scrubbing tools to get
rid of what I can and hope that what I
can't fix just won't show now that
that's done I'm going to rinse them all
off with distilled water just to ensure
that they're at the very least clean
before trying to secure them all I don't
actually want to tumble them tumbling
them would make the surfaces smooth and
I want them to be kind of jagged
this is just me like trying some okay so
all the rocks are clean I've laid them
out in like somewhat of a size order so
I've got really small almost pebble
sized amethyst over here and then they
get really big over here
you can make jokes but how I'm feeling
the positive energy of all the crystals
because this looks freaking awesome
this section right near the power spot
here that hugs all the way up the side I
love that bit and then the top area here
is more just a proof of concept just
definitely make them work there's too
much gap between some of them and it's
too easy to see the individual LEDs but
if I can get the whole area looking like
this that's what I'm going for
I got a lot of work ahead of me so let's
go
that's the glass fully on today so I'm
like really sad hopefully you guys just
watched a really cool time-lapse of me
putting in a huge amount of amethyst
stones and then I did a whole bunch more
work after the camera died and finished
up with what we've got right now as you
can tell though it's off and the CPU is
out of the socket and I have some other
weird ram in there the entire right hand
side of memory doesn't work this whole
bank of memory all four sticks none of
it works it all detects in the bio says
na not applicable no RAM there and if
they're plugged in at all it is unstable
doesn't matter what Ram I use I swapped
out the CPU so this is a sixty nine
hundred K this is a 69 50 X I tried both
of them oh forget about that please that
never happened
don't no stop don't look at it anyways
try both of those doesn't work it's the
motherboard the motherboard is the issue
we have another x99 Strix in the office
I can swap it out we can RMA this one
everything's fine except I just spent
all of those hours gluing it in place so
the plan now is to try to do a
motherboard rescue I have to get it out
of there the top part won't be all that
difficult to get out but the lower
section is going to be a lot of work I
have to get both the graphics cards that
are there in order to get the
motherboard out so in the end I had to
take out all of the amethyst right up
here and most of them coming along this
way but then was able to get away with
leaving this big one which is good and a
couple other little ones as well but it
might be a different story trying to get
those graphics cards back inside now
it's time to put the motherboard in
which I've already prepped with the envy
me drive my 69 hundred K and the
mounting screws for my radiator and I've
swapped out the colors of the custom
Strix logos so yeah time to go let's get
the drives plugged in okay so the
motherboard is back in now actually try
to get those GPS back in the bottom GPU
I'm a little bit worried about oh I
think I got it
oh right is no saying that it prospected
oh that is good
okay alright that went far better than
expected that wasn't too bad
it works it actually works all 64 gigs
fully detects and the sli works I can
verify it on this screen right over here
everything is fine all I need to do now
is put the amethyst back that I took out
put the glass panels on do some
performance testing and we're good so
putting all those amethyst back worked
fine it wasn't too hard I kind of got
used to it at that point it looks great
but we'll look at glam footage of it in
a moment for now
benchmarking benchmarking for this was a
little bit unique because what I really
cared about was how much better it would
stream video games so I had to benchmark
things while streaming using xsplit up
to twitch games acted a little bit oddly
but there was pretty huge improvement
it's something like Metro last light I
went from seeing an average of 74 frames
per second to an average of 120
that's fantastic by itself something
like 2 writer
I went from 65 FPS to still 65 fps if I
turn off xsplit and didn't stream I did
get 77 fps but still
but looking at minimum on the geothermal
map I went from 4.4 5 fps to 28 which is
pretty substantial hit man DirectX 11 I
went from an average of 19 to an average
of 50 that's a pretty major improvement
Deus Ex mankind I went from an average
of 30 with a minimum of 21 and a maximum
of 39 to an average of 56 a minimum of
40 and
maximum of 91 but all of those
performance improvements aside the main
thing that I like about this computer is
what it looks like so we can stop
looking at me and by the way I have a
huge amount of hair right now and my
beard is ridiculous because when we
first started filming this I decided
that I wouldn't get a haircut and I
wouldn't shave until we were done
because I knew it's going to take
forever and I'm disgusting so after this
video I'm going to go take care of this
that'll be that'll be a good thing fresh
books is a simple way to be more
productive organized and get paid
quickly by creating and sending
professional-looking invoices in less
than 30 seconds if you even set up
online payments with just a couple
clicks and get paid up to four days
faster you can see when your client has
seen an invoice and put an end to the
guessing games when you're going to get
paid for your unrestricted 30-day free
trial just go to fresh book Stockholm
slash tech tips and enter line of tech
tips and how did you hear about us
section but anyways look at gland
footage of my computer and yeah while
you're looking at gland footage of my
computer I guess if you check the link
down below there's a links to Amazon
where you can buy some stuff that you
saw in this video there's a place where
you can buy some shirts
there's the like and dislike button so
you can press the one that says like on
it you can get subscribed because this
video was so freakin cool
and no I'm not going to link another
video actually now I'm lying there will
be another video up there eventually
maybe now and then we just keep the
gland footage going afterwards but it'll
be the fallout bomb build that I did
which was another epic video I'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
