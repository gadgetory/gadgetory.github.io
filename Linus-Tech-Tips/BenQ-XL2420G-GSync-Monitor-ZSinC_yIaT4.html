really changed for BenQ in the early
days their stuff was cheap and I was
basically pleased if the copy on the
packaging was devoid of spelling errors
and the display powered on but over the
last few years BenQ has surprised me a
number of times most notably with the XL
2040 a monitor that I declared to be the
best gaming LCD that I had ever seen
when I checked it out about a year ago
and with their prices having risen along
with their status as an incredibly
well-regarded gaming monitor maker
today's look at the XL 24 20 G will be
from the perspective of a youtuber who
really needs to see BenQ take things to
the next level to really be impressed
and who has a video coming soon about
whether it's possible to fake the
performance results of one CPU with
another completely different one so stay
tuned for all of that from December 13th
to 20th 2014 you can save on select
Intel CPUs knucks
and SSDs with special holiday rebates
from select retailers click now to learn
more physically I hoped for more from
the Excel 24 20 G just like every other
excel Series gaming monitor it's got all
the functionality you could want the
base is adequately sturdy and wide
enough that you can't tip it over
there's a 2 port integrated USB hub
there's a cable management hole through
the stand to keep your desk tidy there's
a headphone hook and a solid carrying
handle that adorn the top of the stand
on the back and it's got the full range
of ergonomic adjustments height tilt
swivel and pivot along with a toolless
mechanism to detach the panel from the
stand and screw it into a base amount
should you so desire well that sounded
great Linus what more could you want the
answer lies in the just like every other
XL series bit back there
Ben Q is asking for a lot of money for
this display only a couple hundred less
than a Seuss's rog swift 27-inch monitor
and it feels like they didn't invest in
many improvements to the ID or really
any at all even just thinner bezels and
maybe upgrading the USB hub to USB 3
could have softened the blow a little
bit here as far as the sticker shock is
concerned but you could also argue that
this monitor is not about the looks this
is an eSports and competitive gaming
targeted product and should be treated
more like a tool than a fashion
accessory to which I would reply Touche
so let's get into the functionality then
shall we at the front is a 24 inch 1920
by 1080 144 Hertz TN display with
basically no input leg pixel response
times in the 1 millisecond or less range
support for 3d vision stereo gaming with
optional active shutter glasses and
shockingly strong performance when it
comes to color vibrancy contrast and
viewing angles especially horizontal
viewing angles to the point where if I
didn't let you tilt the monitor way down
or way up you may not actually realize
it's a TN panel so far so good on the
performance front the on-screen menu can
be navigated either with the included
control module that snaps on to the side
of the base with a magnet or with the
on-screen touch buttons and contains
basically all the options I'd expect
from a high-end consumer grade monitor
brightness contrast and color
temperature including a custom mode with
RGB adjustments and then there's also
some fun stuff custom keys gives you one
touch access to functions that you use
most often black equalizer is basically
a monitor level gamma boost to give
competitive players an edge when trying
to spot opponents in dark areas would
suggest that casuals leave this one off
for a more atmospheric gameplay
experience it's got a low blue light
node which theoretically works with the
flicker free DC backlight to reduce
eyestrain and finally the really cool
stuff first is UL mb or ultra low motion
blur mode it uses backlight modulation
to fire bursts of light at the panel
only when the pixels have finished
transitioning to reduce smearing on
fast-moving objects it works at 85 100
or 120 Hertz with pulse width
adjustments to find your optimal balance
between image clarity and screen
brightness and it works so well that you
can actually read
next as you drag a window across the
screen try that with your monitor right
now good luck but it does have the
drawback of reducing overall screen
brightness and on my sample at least
introducing a little bit of noise in
dark areas of the image that look kind
of like very faint scan lines or
something with that said with how well
this monitor performs in the fast gaming
picture mode the only drawback of which
is slightly subdued colors I didn't find
it worthwhile to turn on you LMB due to
the brightness trade-off and the fact
that the second feature doesn't work at
the same time and that second feature is
g-sync if you need a primer on g-sync
click here but if the summary is enough
for you then basically it works with
your modern Nvidia graphics card to get
all the benefits of vsync so no ugly
screen tearing with the benefits of
vsync off so very low input latency and
no stutters awesome and then finally the
thing that really caught my attention
about this monitor forcing me to revise
my list of the only g-sync monitors that
matter which previously contained only
the asus rog swift and Acer xB 280 HK to
include this one as well
unlike other g-sync monitors the XL 24
20 G contains a normal display processor
2 which allows it through the use of
their classic mode to enable some of Ben
Q's usual modes that aren't supported by
the g-sync module and to accept other
inputs other than DisplayPort 1.2
specifically dual link DVI and dual HDMI
a feature that is bound to be a must for
anyone who doesn't have the space to set
up their game console on a separate
display somewhere else and wants to
easily switch between multiple input
devices Bravo Ben Q while this isn't a
feature I personally need on my gaming
monitor on my rig it's something that I
recognize as the potential to be
incredibly important to a great many
other folks out there so this is a
fantastic gaming monitor it's
tremendously responsive but not only
beautiful considering it's a high-speed
TN panel that it's one of the best
performers I've seen when it comes to
motion blur even with a na turned off
altogether
they're in like sRGB mode and it's got a
feature set that makes lesser displays
tremble but it's not perfect the price
is going to be a major turnoff for some
shoppers because I have a hard time
imagining much overlap between the Venn
diagrams of folks looking for 1080p
monitors and folks looking to spend this
much on a display
unless portability is a factor like if
you would be regularly transporting your
PC to Land's so that's the conclusion
it's an awesome display but I think the
number of shoppers interested in it will
increase dramatically when g-sync module
pricing comes down to knock a hundred
bucks or so off the sticker price
speaking of awesome displays you have a
brand new sponsor on the show today HH
