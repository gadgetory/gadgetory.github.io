ever it's got more RAM than ever before
but in all seriousness we all know that
I wouldn't be here at the zoo with my
poor family in tow yes whoa hi with
Hagrid from radical Raptors hanging out
with me these guys are super cool they
let me put the owl in the video freaking
awesome and of course
Dennis who drove over here from the
office if this was just another faster
iPad no no this is so game-changing that
I felt compelled to pull again poor
Dennis out here to the zoo to go for a
walk with me and talk about how it is
going to change the mobile device
industry so without further ado then
let's go do that and or wait actually
here Dylan you can have your bird back
the be quiet dark BassPro 900s modular
design supports a variety of different
layouts and configurations click on the
link in the video description to learn
more it's not really a secret that I've
never been a huge fan of this category
of product back when Apple released the
first iPad I denounced it as as an
uncharitable device and what I mean by
that is that if it was smaller then I
could put it in my pocket and I wouldn't
have to carry a daypack
and if I was you know oh I don't know
at the zoo for example and I did have a
bag well it's not functional enough for
me to not just bring a laptop I mean to
be clear I'm not calling the category
useless I use my iPad 2 all the time
it's just that for the aforementioned
reasons I don't go out with it and
everything that I do on it can still be
done on ipad 2 whether that's watching
movies on Netflix when somebody's on the
TV or whether that's shopping on Amazon
or giving to my daughter to you know
kill some time while daddy takes a nap
or whatever the case may be like I have
no temptation to be out there taking
stabilized 4k video because it has the
same camera as the iPhone 7 and I think
this is something that Apple themselves
has acknowledged not directly but by
maintaining this iPad pro category of
product and by releasing earlier this
year the iPad the most commodity product
that I think we've seen from Apple in
quite some time
like it's it doesn't give you that Apple
premium feels it's like cost down so
that every student in the classroom can
afford one okay so yeah we get the point
the category is not particularly
exciting so then why gets so amped up is
it the speed compared to the last iPad
CPUs what 30% faster GPUs 40% faster
it's got four gigs of RAM more than ever
before on an iOS device no with the
tablet between so many of the services
you use the
in cloud-based where the processing can
be offloaded from the device and the
fact that the user interface on a tablet
is so much more often my bottleneck when
I'm trying to do something compared to
the processing of the device that's not
what gets my motor humming at all okay
what about the size then the size is
different from previous iPad pros at ten
and a half inches it's kind of in
between nine point seven and thirteen or
whatever it was but even there I'm going
to go with no so yes the bezels on a
large iPad are now a lot more like the
bezels on the iPad Mini which which is
something new and something different
sort of because it's different for the
iPad but not different from the rest of
the industry I mean the the race - you
know infinity edges and bezel less
devices is well underway and Apple is
hardly leading the charge even with this
kind of screen to bezel ratio but we are
getting closer because the thing that
I'm really excited about is actually the
screen and no I mean okay the the color
the DCI p3 wide color gamut the 600 nits
peak brightness and the capybara okay I
am I am going to be a pad whole and I'm
going to take a picture of the capybara
look at that it's like a great big
tailless rat I'm not that excited about
HDR because there's not a ton of content
yet and even what is there isn't
especially well mastered now the thing
I'm excited about is the refresh rate
this is in a nutshell where my
admiration for Apple comes from because
I've criticized them a lot and I don't
like everything that they do but what
they do have is the courage to try new
features and when I talk about courage I
am NOT talking about removing the
headphone jack that to me is kind of a
it's almost a way of kind of bullying
the market into adopting their standard
that's not really hurt that's like
calling Sony's insistence on
on memory stickers that's just obnoxious
I'm talking about the courage to spend
an extra I don't know how much maybe
it's 50 cents maybe it's five dollars on
every iPad Pro they sell for a more
advanced this display controller and an
IPS panel that's capable of a 120 Hertz
refresh rate and you might say yeah sure
you know what's five bucks let's say
it's five bucks the answer is a lot
because Apple is going to sell this
product for a nice round number MSRP
regardless of what specs they put in it
it'll be you know $8.99 or $9.99 good no
problem sorry we're back and by the time
they sell five million or ten million of
them now we're talking twenty five
million dollars or 50 million dollars
that's courage spending money on
something that nobody asked for because
you think it's a better experience for
the end-user because that's actually in
my mind one of the biggest problems with
the rest of the electronics industry
only being willing to build something
with the features that your customers
are asking for it that's how you end up
with 20 laptops on the shelf at Best Buy
all of which are basically the same and
while some people seem to think that the
120 Hertz display is about spec padding
and about having something that nobody
else has it's not it matters a lot more
than you probably think and for a lot
more use cases than you probably realize
so let's start with the one that's most
obvious when you initially pick up a
device it feels really fast just the
fact that the screen is refreshing
sooner after you interact with it makes
the device feel instantly more
responsive
even more impressively Apple managed to
do this without compromising one of
their hallmarks which is great battery
life by using adaptive refresh rate
technology so the refresh rate of the
display will actually go down if it's
not displaying high refresh rate content
or if it is displaying a static image
and then it'll go up when you interact
with it and this is one of the things
that people love to criticize Apple
about like oh they didn't invent that no
they didn't invent adaptive refresh rate
tech but what they did do was they
implemented it in a way that is
meaningful and enhances the user
experience and Gaming is another use
case where this makes a ton of sense to
me it's a way to improve the experience
of a game on a higher-end device without
increasing stratification in the App
Store so without driving up the
graphical fidelity to the point where
anything but the 2017 iPad pro is going
to be running the game like a slideshow
so people who buy the higher end device
are going to run the game at 120 frames
per second it's going to be butter
smooth it's going to feel like a really
great experience but act-- developers
don't have to lock themselves out of
being able to access the hordes of
people that own previous generation
devices and honestly that's something
Apple doesn't really want in the App
Store anyway they want apps to run on
all devices that they decide are you
know current and supported not you app
developer you don't get to decide that
Apple decides that and the last one that
a lot of people probably wouldn't
consider is a Senna so you keeping up
sorry here we're going to go this way
the last one that a lot of people
probably wouldn't consider is media
consumption so the cool thing about 120
Hertz is that whether we're talking 60
FPS content 30 FPS content or 24 FPS
movie content all of it can run even if
this wasn't an adaptive refresh rate
display which it is but all of it could
run on a 100
when she hurts display without any
gutter or without any like pulldown or
any kind of like the tomfoolery that
they do where they'll duplicate a frame
in order to take non-native content and
run it on a different refresh rate
display so then back kind of to the
beginning where I don't care that much
about tablets I really don't but what
I'm excited about is what Apple is doing
to the industry with this product I mean
to be clear there is no 100% guarantee
that just because we got a 120 Hertz
display on the 2017 iPad pro that we're
going to get a 120 Hertz display on the
upcoming iPhone 8 in fact I mean the
iPad pro the last generation had USB 3
the iPhone 7 does not and the iPhone 7
has a solid state home button whereas
this new iPad pro does not but I would
say now that Apple has made that
investment into the display controller
now that they've got the feature out
there and since there's no cost in terms
of power consumption to putting it on a
smaller device there is a very good
chance that on Apple's premium devices
we're just going to see this as a
feature moving forward and this is
something that I have wanted for a long
time both high refresh rate and variable
refresh rate are huge experience
changing technologies and what's great
about this is that once Apple does it
everybody else wakes up the ghost
oh oh maybe that's important and we
start seeing it on you know every tablet
and every phone and every computer and
everything starts to feel a little bit
faster and a little bit more premium so
that ultimately is why I chair about the
iPad pro 2017 because I don't care about
the iPad pro 2017 I fix it the place to
go if you need to tear down or repair
pretty much any electronic device
they've got guides for so many popular
thinking we're talking the galaxy sa the
iPhone the Nintendo switch the iMac and
they're also leading the charge in the
electronic repair tools industry with
their iconic black and blue pro tech
toolkit
don't let the sleek design fool you it's
got both beauty and brawn with
high-quality steel bits and tools tough
enough to handle any repair or mod that
you throw at them and oh this is new
it's now only 59 95 BAM it includes the
64 bit driver kit their prying tools
they're ESD safe tweezers and a flex
extension which is also magnetic for
hard-to-reach screws and iFixit tools
are backed by eye fixit's lifetime
warranty so you want to tackle your next
hack fix or build with the pro tect tool
kit go to ifixit.com slash Linus to snag
it for only fifty nine ninety five so
thanks for watching our walk in the park
discussion about the iPad pro we had so
much fun making the other one out in the
rain and Taiwan I figured what the hey
we'll do it again also it really was
between dragging my family to the office
and dragging Dennis out here to the zoo
with us so we went with the latter
option if you guys just like the video
you can hit the dislike button but if
you liked it hit the like button get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
where to buy the iPad pros got an
affiliate link down in the video
description also down there we've got
our oh I'm not wearing one of our shirts
but we've got a link to our merch
storage cube where you can buy LT
t-shirts and we've got a link to our
community forum where you can join up in
talk tech now I'm going to go back to
watching this Eagle check out that
rabbit down there look at that he's like
yeah I see you rabbit rabbits like yeah
