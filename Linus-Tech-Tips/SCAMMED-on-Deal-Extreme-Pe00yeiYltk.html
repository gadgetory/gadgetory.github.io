Aliexpress and eBay can be a great way
to get awesome deals on used or
off-brand tech products and if you're
like me and you're kind of a gigantic
cheapskate the prospect of saving money
can be pretty enticing but today's video
is a cautionary one a buyer beware tale
of making sure that you think critically
about a great deal before pulling the
trigger because even spending $1 is a
waste of money if you don't get anything
useful in return for example this USB to
Ethernet adapter that is advertised as
being 10 gigabit ready for just over $4
a piece is very eye-catching but as we
are going to see a lot of the time
things like this are just too good to be
true unlike our sponsor Thermaltake and
they're a 500 case which features a
modern minimalistic design brushed
aluminum panels and dual hinge Swing
tempered glass doors check it out today
at the link below
so you might understandably find
yourself thinking wow a 10 Gigabit
Ethernet adapter for 4 u.s. dollars well
gee that sounds like a way better deal
than this 10 gig adapter from a kiddy oh
that costs a whopping $200 I mean why is
this thing even so expensive well now
that they're both here these products
don't even seem to be in the same
universe as one another via kiddie Oh
uses a high-speed Thunderbolt 3
interface it's got a large well
ventilated aluminum chassis it's got a
nice premium feel to it including a
removable cable and we actually haven't
tested this yet but theoretically if we
plug it into a device like oh say a
laptop that was a 5-4 gig file ok
so 10 gig working on a laptop and that's
nice it's bus powered - it doesn't need
any external power adapter now let's
turn our attention to our dealextreme
adapter this one is made of cheap
plastic with flimsy connectors and the
cable that I think could probably best
be described as flaccid as driverless
that's pretty nice but what in the world
could that be 100 megabit per second
let's take that same 4 gig file and have
a real bad time this doesn't even make
sense why is it going at 20 megabytes a
second oh my Wi-Fi is still okay and
you're done Biden oh boy yeah that's
what we were expecting
literally slower than Wi-Fi so at this
point it's fairly clear that this
product has been misrepresented by the
website that's selling it but the
problem is that by the time you've got
it in your hands to test it unless
you're gonna pay you know 25 bucks to
ship back
for dollar item it's a bit too late to
find out that your steal of a deal was
just a steal of your money so how do you
differentiate between a scam like this
and the real thing before you pull the
trigger you know what I'm gonna use this
10 gig adapter for my web browsing for
the rest of this video because it's sexy
now because there are cases where you
can find extraordinary value from
up-and-coming manufacturers or on
liquidation deals we're not saying that
you should just dismiss outright
anything that seems to be a bargain
we're just saying that your spidey sense
should be tingling and you need to make
sure that you're doing extra research so
the first thing that we're gonna check
is whether there is blatantly
conflicting information on the product
page check out for example this blender
that's advertised as 3 horsepower and
2200 watts for a cool $90 the problem
here is that the most you can
consistently pull from a 120 volt
circuit is about 1500 watts before you
risk tripping a breaker and the
description of the item actually does
correct this misleading title so then in
the case of our adapter here we can
actually see that the title and the
detailed specs below are at the very
least consistent both claiming to be 10
gigabit per second but then getting into
our next tip if we look closely at the
product photos we can actually see that
this adapter is clearly labeled Fast
Ethernet which yes young kids out there
is the actual official name for 100
megabit Ethernet that is only 1% of the
advertised speed and this is far from
the only example of blatant miss
labeling on sites like this one it's a
very common practice used to lure in
unsuspecting customers there are the
scan SD cards that we recently did a
video on fake brand name fashion Goods
cables that are supposedly certified for
Apple devices and of course misleading
batteries some of the batteries we found
even used quotation marks in the title
around the capacity and then show the
real capacity in the description below
although I'm pretty sure that real
capacity is probably a load of bunk as
well it's almost like clickbait titles
except in this case you're paying for it
and it's definitely false advertising
back to our Ethernet example though
we've already got enough evidence to
turn us off of this thing but there is
still more for us to learn here
conflicting specifications can be a
surefire way to identify BS so then
we've got that cleaned 10 gigabit per
second transmission speed well that's
pretty cool but what's also included
here in the description is that it's USB
2.0 type C now most people
understandably might see a USB type-c
connection and go oh well that's really
modern and fast but as a tech nerd I
know right off the bat that type C is a
physical standard that can carry all
kinds of different signals and the USB
2.0 protocol is inspect for anywhere
near 10 gigabit per second speed
actually it tops out at around 5% of
that now if you're not so technically
inclined you might not know or even have
the desire to know what the differences
are between all the USB versions and
that's where our next tip comes in if
you don't know what a specific term
means that doesn't mean it's not
important so Google it and this can be
applicable to any marketing terms or
buzzwords because those might not mean
anything at all even if you know less
bondage on your new phone sounds really
enticing back to this specific title
again though if you search up USB 2.0
the first thing that's going to come up
is the Wikipedia page for USB and it
shows that USB 2.0 is maximum signaling
rate is 480 megabit per second oops oops
the final nail in the coffin here is
actually the model number which we can
see in the photo remarketing of existing
products is very common on the
types of marketplaces see soldier
council so with a quick Google search we
find that this part number actually
corresponds to a real tech Ethernet
controller that's designed to run at 10
megabit or 100 megabit speeds now that I
think of it
we should probably crack this open and
find out if it's even a proper Realtek
controller not yet though we'll get to
that after our last tip you might have
noticed that one thing that we didn't
mention is user reviews and we'd love to
say that that's a good way to avoid
scams and negative reviews should be
heated for the most part it's just that
they're not the Silver Bullet that you
might hope fake positive reviews have
become a huge problem
even on reputable online stores like
Amazon as for these ones well simply put
they've been pretty misleading from our
experience this particular item actually
doesn't even have any reviews yet but
dealextreme shows items with no reviews
as having five filled in stars and that
only changes if our review is submitted
all right anyway we've had our fun now I
think it's time for us to crack this nut
open Jake what was the plan here ah cut
stuff I guess so this is cool as
expected we've got only four conductors
here which tells us that yes of course
this is not going to transmit it
anything more than USB to speeds you
would need nine conductors for USB 3 and
20 yeah how many for 24 yeah for
Thunderbolt 3 so yeah this is clearly
very clearly not anything other than USB
2 yes it is a real tech controlling well
at least it's printed as that so one
question you might ask yourself is if
you've only got four conductors here why
do you need this 24-pin connector on the
other end I mean it just comes down to
convenience USB type-c is reversible
it's durable and of course modern
devices are switching over to using it
it's just that we're clearly only using
a couple of pins for the actual data
interface on it so everything else is
just blank it's just not connected to
anything
by contrast let's open up our 10 gigabit
adapter here and this is one whoa beefy
beefy friggin thing although I gotta say
the design of this chassis is not really
that amazing because there's no like
heat conduction yeah get your face
between smaller or maybe I can bet you
it's very strong I'm sure you could
probably play hockey with it and then
come back and use it as your adapter
just Canadian things so there it is if
you want ten gigabit connectivity you've
got to have a 10 gigabit ready chipset
and of course you've got to have an
interface at the other end that is
actually capable of taking that 10 gig
and transmitting it to something and
you've got to have a way to dissipate
all the heat and whatnot apparently wow
this chip is so gives off so much heat
they've actually got a thermal pad on
the back that IHS here is almost as why
this is this entire board what's under
there not bad be round probably oh
you're probably right
seems fine oh oh God
what the hell kind of thermal pad is
this excellent where's your pointer
thing I don't know I'm just pocket I
just want to see oh my god no man is
that like an actual like just bare
silicon to that you're just like can
only think so no no I think it's on a
package oh god the noise is a stop chill
just chill it's all good
well I can't read it anyway don't have
to replace those the faster yeah
you mind Jake so we have much choice
about noise yeah oh god I hate it so
sorry I'm sorry it's like the tech nerd
equivalent of nails on a chalkboard
scratching a microcontroller with a
knife and I can't read it the markings
are like what like scratched off with a
knife no they're just really faint and
not like obvious anyway somehow Oh like
scratched alright well here you go so
conclusion time then we know that four
dollars versus two hundred dollars is it
a huge gap and this is a pretty obvious
example of seems too good to be true but
the point of making this video was to go
through some of the steps that you can
take for something that isn't quite as
obvious to determine the fake stuff
from the real stuff and we hope that
even if this might not have been useful
for you maybe you can share this video
with someone that you know who has been
hoodwinked before math drop and
Sennheiser have teamed up to bring us
the PC 37 X gaming headset it features
angled drivers and an open back design
for a nice natural sound and better
stereo imaging and those drivers
actually come from the same family as
the HD 5 9 8 and HD 600 series
headphones they come with a noise
cancelling microphone and they're
available on mass drop at the link below
for just one $19.99 for a limited time
go check them out so thanks for watching
guys if you just like this video you can
hit that button but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or even consider
checking out where to buy the stuff we
featured at the link in the video
description like to be very clear as
long as you know what you're getting
four bucks is like 4 bucks is four bucks
if you need a 100 megabit adapter while
you're down there you can check out our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum that's
totally worth a joint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
