brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries so we're here at the
steelseries booth at pax prime 2013 dan
radin the director of audio products at
steelseries is going to be at least
modeling the Siberia elite so this is
love I mean this is the most premium
headset you guys have ever built this is
really the finest steelseries headset in
our company's history we really wanted
to take everything that we learned in
the ten years of Siberia and bring it to
a better quality of audio a better
quality feel in your hands better
quality materials better isolation
better software control just a better
gaming experience with every aspect
related to audio alright so they offer
came while let's walk you through it
physically here guys so first of all is
the bands have been replaced instead of
using a plastic lightweight band you've
gone with a thin steel band that
actually gives it a much more rigid feel
that traditional Siberia suspension
system that means no adjustment every
time you put it on is still present the
earcups have been replaced completely
with these extremely large plush ear
cups and what these also serve to do is
hold the headphones a little bit further
away from your ears so the drivers are
not right up against your ear this is
going to act as a bit of a cushion zone
or buffer zone that makes the audio
sound more natural now in terms of style
the lighting is one of the more
interesting things about the Siberia
elite here so this one is running just
read however i have another siberia
elite right here this is the black
version so it's available in black and
white to start and you can put any of
16.8 million colors on those little
light bands on the side which is
extremely customizable as far as
headphones go now that will work guys
remember if you're plugged in via analog
but the good news is is Siberia elite
can be plugged in pretty much however
you want so why the approach to
flexibility rather than offering two
SKUs like you've done in the past well
we really see that gaming is moving to a
couple of different places one being our
heritage is PC gaming and we're not
ending that but we also want to
acknowledge that people are playing
games everywhere you know I live in New
York City I'm on the subway I see people
playing games on their phone on their
tablet I talked to people where our
company's headquarters is in Chicago and
all their kids are playing games in the
backseat of the car on the iPad so we
wanted all of our newest latest greatest
products to work with not only pc not
only mac but also the future of
platforms and that is mobile and so in
terms of the the software implementation
of that it comes with a USB sound card
or you can plug it into whatever analog
connection you want but you guys have
worked a lot of stuff into the new
SteelSeries Engine 3 that's different
from before what do you guys got in
there so SteelSeries Engine 3 is our new
software suite that helps you optimize
the performance of any steelseries
enabled device so this not only works
with Siberia elite it also works with
our new 9h tournament gaming headset it
works with some of our mice some of our
keyboards and the goal really is to have
an entire ecosystem of connected gaming
peripherals what it does for audio
specifically is it gives you a
great-looking easy-to-use interface for
everything from loading game-specific eq
presets to customizing the performance
of Dolby surround sound to Mike auto
gain to Mike compression to noise
reduction in the background to
customizing the led so you could have
not only all those colors but you could
also have them do different things you
can have them turn on and off you can
have them color shift as you saw in that
black one you can have them respond to
game events so if there's an explosion
in the game you can have an explosion in
your headset so if you're on a voice on
a VoIP kind of chat scenario your
teammates could see you just got blew up
that's very very cool so tell me about
the microphone the microphone is our
largest directional gooseneck that we've
ever done and a size does matter folks
absolutely now Siberia 10 years ago
introduced the retractable gooseneck
microphone to gamers and what that does
is it allows you to get the mic closer
to where you want it in the
enter or side of your mouth the closer
the mic is to your mouth the more you
get of what's called proximity effect
and basically that means you get a
better quality of speech sound its
retractable so because we're moving to
more mobile if you want to use it for
voice calls and you're out on the street
and you don't want to pull it out you
can still use it retracted but this
goose neck allows you to get the mic
where you want it and also see when your
mic is muted because you get this
illumination now we've got the
tournament grade headset that you
alluded to before this is the 9h so this
would be the highest-end tournament
headset that you've ever released as
well walk me through it that's right so
the H series is really where we come
from and and I like to think of H as
being our heritage H standing for
heritage which is tournament gaming
that's kind of where we made our name
the 9h is the finest h-series headset
we've ever made now what's cool about
the 9h is not only does it include the
next generation steelseries proprietary
speaker drivers like we saw in the
Siberia elite but it also includes our
first-ever double enclosure ear cup so
what that means is like when you build a
recording studio you build a room and
you build another room inside it so you
get great isolation the noise doesn't
leak out of the studio that's what these
ear cups are these are double enclosure
ear cups so you put them on in a noisy
tournament setting it blocks out a lot
of the outside noise this also has our
first fully retractable microphone so
you push in it pops out same gooseneck
as on on our Siberia and other h-series
headsets but this one really gets the
mic exactly where you want it right in
front of you you address it from the
front and this also has our SteelSeries
Engine 3 software so you can have all of
that fancy customization and noise
rejection all those features that will
help you be heard better in tournament
settings that are noisy so in terms of
comfort what have you guys done with
this because I mean Siberia is all about
comfort but the reality of it is if you
build a headset that's not comfortable
then you might as well just fold up and
close close your shop now I think you're
right about that so just like our
Siberia elite these ear cups are over
padded with memory foam so they conform
to the shape of your ears and the way
that you your head wants them to fit we
also have memory foam in the head
band this is a new headband designed for
us very flexible this is not the final
look but it's going to be a very
attractive headband we wanted to show
this to the gamers at PAX because we
thought it was important for everybody
to see where we're going that despite
the fact that we've introduced some
mobile headsets in the last few years
we've done some different things in
different areas we still want everyone
to know that we're focused on the
tournament gamer because that's where we
come from speaking of that one of the
other features that tournament gamers I
think will appreciate is detachable
cable the other end of the detachable
cable which by the way is double fabric
braided is a volume mute control and
that same steelseries micro connector
which is our custom 8-pin connector that
we use on the USB sound card as well as
on connectors for mobile exactly flux
in-ear pro as well yeah and then we and
then we allow you to connect either to
your PC with the dual connectors or
mobile with the single connector or Mac
so that gives us a nice robust rugged
connection physically and also allows us
to send a lot of data between the
headset and the computer awesome thank
you very much it's been a total pleasure
having you walk us through these guys
remember our trip to pax prime 2013 is
powered by Western Digital Intel and
steel series so big thanks to you guys
for making it even possible for us to be
here thanks a lot thanks for having us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
