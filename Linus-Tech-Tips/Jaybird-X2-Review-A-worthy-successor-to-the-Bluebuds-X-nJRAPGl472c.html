wholeheartedly as I did with the j-bird
bluebloods X so while I was actually
disappointed with the follow-up model
the jaybird x2 maybe it's because I went
in with the wrong expectations
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click in
the link in the video description to
learn more so it started with the
package the earphones are well presented
in the accessory package includes the
earphones themselves a short charging
cable wire management clips and I'll
explain these better later a few
different sizes of their ear fins that
keep the earphone in place in your ear a
few different sizes of both standard and
comply foam ear tips a very nice touch
for improved comfort and fit if you
don't mind regularly purchasing
replacements and a carrying case that
annoyed me more than it probably should
have but who the hell was the person at
j-bird who thought that this you know
press down just hard enough but don't
press too hard
derp tastic linn thing improved in any
way the magnetic clamshell that came
with the bluebloods X I wish I'd been in
that meeting so I could personally
explain that the square wheel is not an
invention anyone needs and sometimes
it's fine to just stick with what we
know works and while I was sitting there
being annoyed by that I observed also
that unlike the previous version the X 2
lacks any included documentation relying
instead on a link to their site where
you can do it online and while I'm all
for environmental preservation a really
basic Quick Start Guide press the button
for this long to enter pairing mode
could have saved me a couple minutes of
powering on only to then power it back
down again
until I realized that you just need to
hold it for longer when first powering
it on to enter pairing mode and that
instruction would have fit on a single
piece of paper just as well as a link to
the site anyway but with that out of the
way it's time to talk about wearing them
user reviews online seem to indicate
that the X 2's fit better or even much
better than the bluebloods X for me
there was no noticeable difference and
frankly I wonder if that was just first
time users having their eyes opened to
the joys of comply tips which for the
uninitiated
can be rolled up before being inserted
into the ear canal where they expand
for a nice snug fit because the X 2's
are physically like even down to their
weight as far as I can tell exactly the
same thing
okay then Linus how about performance
battery life very similar to last gen
jaybird claims eight hours or more is
doable with users online backing this up
for me
they use them for an hour or two per
week and throw them in your gym bag
between sessions use case yield at about
six and a half hours of music time which
I am more than happy with remember that
batteries discharged themselves while
they're in storage on the subject of
sound quality again I would have to say
they're very similar user accounts vary
across the internet but from my
side-by-side listening the most
noticeable difference was that the x2s
pack a bit more punch in the low end not
in an unpleasant muddy way
and unless you're listening to them side
by side you're probably not going to
pick up on any of that anyway so then
what the hell did they change frankly
not much while I'd love to say that you
know it features innovations like the
case has a battery bank in it and then
the headphones charge wirelessly inside
are like they're noticeably lighter or
the general voice assistant has been
significantly amped up or the call
quality it does have microphone by the
way is is is way better or or they
finally fix that one freaking thing that
really bugged me on the original the way
that you couldn't reverse the stereo
channels when you're wearing them in the
alternate over the ear mode which by the
way is what those little cable
management clips are for although
usually I'm lazy and just tie them in a
knot which I guess leads us to the
conclusion where I have to ask what
exactly was the point of this product
and the only conclusion I can draw is
that it was an inexpensive marketing
campaign for their expanded color range
yes it's available in more colors and
some other really small tweaks that
could have been rolled out silently
because if they'd approached someone
like me or Marcus asking us to make a
new video review of the new jaybird
earphones that you know
our colors we'd have probably told them
to go take a hike but if they tell us
hey it's a completely new product it's
the x2 well here we are people are reira
viewing the same product but the good
news here at least the take away from me
is that anyone who wants great wireless
earphones should be thankful for the
jaybird x2 because it means the blue
buds X is cheaper now that it sits under
this one in the product stack speaking
of things that are affordable we've got
a new sponsor today eToro
and pay attention because this is
actually not that simple eToro is a
social investment platform what does
that mean great question
you can view statistics including net
gain and risk level as well as the
portfolio's of other investors and if
you like what they're doing
you can copy them in an effort to get
results that are similar to theirs for
yourselves so you can copy one or many
of the more than four-and-a-half million
registered traders on the platform or
show your own success in trading and get
others to copy you if you get copied you
get paid two percent of all earnings
gained by copying you to yourself on a
monthly basis and once you get your
first copier you become a popular
investor and can start working your way
up through the popular investor tiers
gaining more rewards as you move up
eToro has investors from 150 countries
around the world unfortunately it's not
available in the US but it is available
in Canada and throughout Europe and if
you want to learn more about eToro or
view some of their popular investors and
