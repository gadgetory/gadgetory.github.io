Prime 2015 this year check out their
cloud to gaming headset in the video
description down below also thank you to
a soos and Corsair alright guys time to
check out the msi lightning 980ti this
thing is huge I'll get into the
dimensions later but it has two thousand
eight hundred and sixteen CUDA cores
running at a base clock of twelve
hundred and three megahertz and a boost
clock of thirteen hundred and four
megahertz
although as you guys know that probably
doesn't really matter due to how GPU
boost works but it's the highest
advertised boost clock on a gtx 980ti
that I know of which is pretty beastly
and probably means that the final boost
clock from GPU boost will be absolutely
huge especially due to the size of the
cooler on this thing and the amount of
bands on this thing and all that goes in
terms of memory it has a stock amount of
memory as six gigs of 384-bit gddr5 but
it's running at seven thousand and
ninety six freaking maegor's it's just a
power input you have to eight pin
connectors and one six pin connector
which is a healthier GPU boost numbers
use the power phases you have twelve GPU
and three memory faces it has a ten
layer PCB and triple overvoltage triple
temp monitoring and v checkpoints all
for your GPU memory and PLL there's twin
BIOS they have a gaming BIOS and an OC
BIOS although I just run it on the OC by
us no matter what you're doing is just
removing some kind of base limiters but
you'll be fine GPU boost is gonna stop
you from frying your card anyways under
those three giant fans that I mentioned
earlier you have triple eight millimeter
heat pipes and some other heat pipes in
there as well which should help cooling
these things are huge just like the car
so you have the huge card this thing is
330 millimeters long a hundred and forty
millimeters tall and 63 millimeters
thick so yeah be careful if you're gonna
try to fit this into a case you got two
SMI fingers on the top and a pcie 3.0
connector on the bottom and then two in
terms of i/o you have three display
ports one HDMI and one dual link DVI
connector and those are actually
gold-plated nothing that does anything
for the quality of the connection but it
will apparently
help you plug things in overtime because
it's a little bit malleable and will
form to your connector I'm really
interested to see how well this thing
boosts on an actual rig but as I can't
test this here we'll just have to wait
thank you guys for watching check your
hike Rex's gaming YouTube channel up in
the card section of the top right hand
corner and also thank you to a Sousa
named Coursera first issue of this year
be sure to subscribe to HyperX this
channel I forgot to give that back call
out if you want to see the products
brought here this year by HyperX a soos
and Corsair check out the link in the
video description down below
and thank you guys for watching I'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
