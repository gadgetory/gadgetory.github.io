product to unbox this is the den Q XL
2410 t and this is a very unique product
on the market and I will tell you why
because there are lots of 24-inch LCDs
there are even lots of LED backlit LCD
there are at least a few 3d ready
that is Nvidia 3d vision ready 120 Hertz
LCDs and there are lots of LCDs that
have high-end faces with with pivot and
height adjust features and all that kind
of good stuff but what does not exist on
the market other than this particular
product is something with all of those
features so this is an LED backlit 120
hertz 3d ready monitor and what I'm
gonna do is for this unboxing I'm
actually going to cut it in the middle
of it because monitors are a little bit
tough to do in real time because there's
a lot of pieces and a lot of packing
material you can see we've got about a
good half inch at the very least of
packing foam around the monitor to
protect it in transit so once you remove
that one piece of foam we find the
monitor itself is wrapped in a
protective foamy sheath okay so we can
take that out and you know what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna extract this and
then we'll cut back alright so the
assembly process is pretty simple we
extracted the base which you can see has
rubber feet on the bottom which is great
for non-slip and then all you do is take
the monitor itself and drop it into the
base it snaps into place
but then to ensure it doesn't come out
you can go ahead and either use a screw
driver or your fingers to tighten this
up and fold that flat now the monitor is
assembled it also comes like this which
means that obviously the base features
pivot which is pretty cool and I'm a big
fan of pivot because if nothing else
pivot makes it a lot easier to install
your cables and and set up your monitor
when you first set it up so here's one
thing that I do
to figure out so lift press okay oh you
know what it was yeah it's probably
locked yeah okay so let's take that off
and then it should unlock itself okay
give me a sec to figure this out guys so
contrary to what I thought it actually
lifts from here so it does not lift from
right here so that I was pulling on it
wrong so you just press in there and
then lift and then you can adjust it
freely however you want so the base
features like I said tip it it features
height adjustment okay so you can see
how much height adjustment there is
quite a lot of range you can tilt so
there's the actually note you want to
keep doing that from the side so you can
see the lowest tilt angle that we have
very few people are gonna have it like
kind of up like this and then tilt it
down though I don't think too many
people sit below their monitor so this
one's more important so this is how far
it tilts back and since you're usually
sitting at a desk looking down at your
monitor that's sort of the more relevant
one and here I'm gonna come in head-on
and then I'm gonna show you guys how far
we are able to swivel so it has all of
the different height adjustments that
you'd pretty much want now I'm gonna go
ahead and say the base and the stand are
not built they're not built out of metal
so they're not the most sturdy and
robust that I have ever seen but they
are very functional it's not like the
monitor is unstable once you've placed
it somewhere and they are very they have
also a very neutral aesthetic so there's
nothing really polarizing about it one
way or the other and that's what allows
this monitor do have all of these
features and still be priced so
aggressively so let's go ahead and tilt
it back up and one well I want to have a
look at what we have in terms of inputs
so here we have dual link DVI and you
can see that BenQ has actually included
a dual link cable all of the pins are
present in that DVI cable that means
that you have full support for 1080p at
120 Hertz we also have VGA input as well
as HDMI input and then last but not
least we have our power input way down
here the on-screen display is controlled
by the buttons here
and then I'm gonna go ahead and guess
since I haven't looked at the front of
the monitor yet that those are labels on
the front of the monitor which they are
so here's our power LED power enter
right left menu as well as an auto
adjust button over here we can see that
Ben Q has sort of given us a summary of
the features of this monitor first of
all these are the professional gamers
that this was developed for gaming with
their participation so that's pretty
neat I think this is the first monitor
I've seen with that marketing we've
certainly seen motherboards
coolers keyboards mice all kinds of
different peripherals but never a
monitor before and I can definitely see
why they would want to market it that
way because really everything about this
monitor is for gaming from the Nvidia 3d
vision ready certification to the 120
Hertz refresh rate which bear in mind
these two are not necessarily that this
isn't just for 3d vision a hundred and
twenty Hertz makes for a way smoother
gaming experience because contrary to
what some people might tell you yes your
eye can perceive more than 60 Hertz in a
game if you're running at 120 frames per
second on a 120 Hertz monitor versus
running at 60 frames per second on a 60
Hertz monitor it will look perceivably
smoother I guarantee it
okay we've got smart scaling we've got 2
millisecond graded gray times which is
pretty much necessary if you want to
have a 3d vision monitor because of that
fast refresh rate and then we also have
this is nice too
so this is not a glare type coating this
is actually a proper matte finish
combined with the LED backlighting that
should give us pretty good color
reproduction as well but I haven't
actually had a chance to try this
monitor yet so thank you for checking
out my unboxing here of the now I've
gone and forgotten the little model name
and the camera now let me move that on
me the XL 2410 t don't forget to
