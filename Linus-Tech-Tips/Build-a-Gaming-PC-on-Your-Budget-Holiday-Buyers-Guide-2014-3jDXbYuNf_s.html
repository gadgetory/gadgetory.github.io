just like last year I'll be addressing
three different price points under 500
around a thousand and around two
thousand before the cost of Windows with
three different sets of recommendations
and rationale for the parts that I chose
pricing is pulled from a combination of
newegg.com
and amazon.com with a sanity check at
NCI XCOM to make sure that it's not
wildly more expensive at you know who
knows some other place so we'll start
with just game this system isn't
powerful enough for heavy use outside of
you know day-to-day general use and
1080p gaming and doesn't try to sell
itself based on future-proof news the
cpu was the toughest decision here
because AMD 750k quad core and intel's g
32:58 dual core are both similarly
priced overclockable and can run on
cheap motherboards so it came down to
the design philosophy for the system the
best performance right now and even the
Liam DS quad core design might give it
the edge in future games the Intel chip
gets the nod today thanks to its better
single-threaded performance and lower
heat output when overclocked which will
allow us to turn it speed up a fair bit
even with the basic included cooler the
motherboard only had to meet a couple of
key needs it had to support overclocking
on the G 32 58 which it does with the
latest bios and it needed a PCI Express
16x expansion slot bingo
my RAM choice of a single stick of the
cheapest ddr3 that I could find
probably looks a little funny since this
CPU will benefit from a dual channel
configuration with two sticks
but while 16 gigs may be useful in the
future we don't really need it today and
my choice of a single 8 gig stick allows
me to upgrade to 16 gigs later without
scrapping my existing memory since my
board only has 2 Ram expansion slots the
case and power supply choice was
dictated by the available options really
at this price point a case in power
supply bundles tend to be available at
lower prices but mostly junk so I went
with the only aggressively priced bundle
skew from a brand that I trust that I
could find the video card is where this
rig can be a bit flexible based on
regular prices in our target cost for
the total system the r7 260x
is the clear winner given its similar
performance to the 750 Ti at 1080p in
titles that we've tested recently and
it's much lower price storage is where
just gain gets the biggest upgrade since
last year thanks to the plummeting
prices of SSDs in the last year and we
went with a 120 gig kingston v300 SSD
and that thing is cheap and a wd 1
terabyte Green Drive for mass storage
and games
so in summary just game is very similar
to last year's model with a couple of
key differences it's got similar gaming
performance but now it gets USB 3 I'll
be it not in the front and a much better
storage solution which I'd really
recommend keeping in or even bumping up
to a 2 terabyte drive if you have a big
game library but you also have the
option to take out the hard drive or go
just hard drive rather than having an
SSD as well and then dumping that money
back into a graphics card where an r9
270 would be a worthy upgrade our second
system is game now similarly to just
game we didn't worry ourselves about
performance tomorrow but unlike just
game we've really avoided skimping in
areas where we felt like we were losing
20 percent of the potential performance
to save 10% of the cost this one is all
about bang for the buck the CPU was
another tough call here
I wish Intel had something all
lot more competitive in this price range
because between the Pentium chip for 70
bucks and their entry-level K Series i5
for 240 bucks
they have nothing that over clocks so
for an enthusiast oriented buyer's guide
like this one
AMD wins at this price point for sure
with their six core FX 6300 now my
initial plan was to go with a
motherboard that supported SLI but I
scrapped that when I did my philosophy
checked and realized that I was spending
about another forty dollars on a feature
that I wasn't using today and so we went
with the m5 a 97 a very well proven
product for a ram I went with 16 gigs of
HyperX fury 1866 megahertz ddr3 but I
could easily swap that out with a
comparable product from another trusted
brand like Corsair orgy skill I added
the extra capacity though because while
strictly speaking games might not need
more than eight gigs today web browsers
also need to run well on gaming machines
and if you're a tab fiend like me you
might enjoy the extra breathing room
that a bit more system memory affords
you the power supply was another
component where I picked out something
much more expensive than cut it down
dramatically when I realized that I was
spending too much this power supply
might not really look like anything
special but it will handle our CPU and
GPU just fine as long as we don't plan
to upgrade them and aftermarket cooler
to give us more overclocking Headroom is
a must on this chip thanks to its six
processing cores and decidedly last gen
efficiency but thankfully there are
great choices for around 30 bucks and
this one will take care of our chip
nicely for the case we went with the
same one that we used for our Kaveri
build guide about six months ago it
looks okay to my eyes it has ventilation
over the graphics card area and it's
reasonably easy to build an in-game to
manage so there you go the graphics card
is where we blew most of our money on
this machine but the GTX 970 is just a
remarkable graphics card that
single-handedly takes this from a budget
box to a very competent gaming machine
and thanks to its power efficiency it
saves us a couple bucks on the PSU to
boot for storage I feel like 250 gigs is
the sweet spot for SSD capacity where
you can install programs and pictures
but not necessarily lots of games
videos on your boot drive without
worrying about it too much and this
drive is well-known to be reliable and
is at a great price right now we also
added the best bang for the buck
capacity of WD green for secondary
storage to go with it the 3 terabyte
model costs twice as much as the one
terabyte and stores three times as much
stuff ok and then finally we checked in
an optical drive because it's only 20
bucks and like Yolo right all in all
gain now actually has less raw CPU
performance than last year's model so if
you had a few more bucks to spend power
supply with some more room for upgrades
or a better CPU might not be a terrible
bet but given the size of modern games I
stand behind the upgraded storage and I
felt like the better GPU was also a
worthwhile trade-off for gamers - and
that's where that extra money went which
leads us to game on our 4k capable
gaming machine where we stressed less
about saving a few bucks and focus more
on having the best possible experience
well but without completely losing track
of the value proposition of the parts we
were using CPU was an easy choice this
time the Intel 4690k quad-core
overclocks like a bat out of hell and
unless you tortured on purpose features
enough processing cores for any game and
even medium intensity content creation
for the motherboard we went with a z87
a because z97 doesn't actually offer a
tangible performance benefit and the
only thing we were really after here was
support for CPU overclocking and support
for SLI stepping up to a pro model will
give you more creature comforts like
Wi-Fi but we decided to allocate our
budget a little bit differently this
year for RAM I didn't change anything
from game now 16 gigs is still enough
for most people today and you can check
another kid in tomorrow if you feel like
you need 32 at said time and then for
our power supply we actually decided to
splurge a little bit here since we went
with two graphics cards and a windowed
but fairly small case so we grabbed a
fully modular power supply which
provides the benefit of helping things
look tidy since its windowed and even
though it's not all about the
bling-bling um gallon doesn't hurt to
have an expensive gadget look expensive
rather than shoddy
speaking of expensive I blew over a
hundred bucks on the cooler this time
around and there are a couple of reasons
for that one this is an excellent cooler
will keep our CPU safe while
overclocking and two is that in spite of
its power this is shaping up to be a
pretty quiet machine so I wanted
something that wouldn't ramp up too hard
even when gaming it would stay quite
quiet the case was an easy one the
fantex enthu Pro has the features and
build quality of cases that cost much
more and it's compatible with all the
hardware we need with ample cooling and
I think it looks fantastic
and then where we spent again all the
budget the dual GTX 970 graphics cards
that I squeezed into our 2000 ish price
point now I know what you're going to
say - you always say single better GPU
versus sli lesser GPUs and that's
actually not what I always say I always
add except sometimes the 970 is one of
those sometimes it's so similar in
performance to its bigger brother the
980 and so much less expensive that two
of them costs only about 20% more than a
single 980 but will absolutely wreck the
single card solution in any games that
scaled basically at all in SLI for
storage we basically yolo'd out and
doubled the capacity of our previous
choices even though a 730 series SSDs
performance benefit over the older 520
isn't that huge in the real world and
the six terabyte green cost more than
twice as much as the 3 terabyte green I
mean you have somebody got somewhere to
store your stuff though right you know
storage is very flexible you could
decide how you wanted to spend that
money but there you go and then finally
more Yolo I'm get threw in a DVD burner
again just in case you want one which
makes our game on machine not only by
far the fastest gaming rig in our
buyer's guide which of course I would
hope it would be since it's the most
expensive but also the most versatile
there are a couple things you could add
like stepping up to a core i7 and
doubling up on ran if you really need
the extra multi-threading and
multitasking performance but other than
that this is about as much as I'd
recommend
ending on a mostly for gaming tower that
will deliver a great user experience
across the board for a very long time
speaking of great user experiences for
years to come five for club is giving
our viewers that's you guys a chance to
