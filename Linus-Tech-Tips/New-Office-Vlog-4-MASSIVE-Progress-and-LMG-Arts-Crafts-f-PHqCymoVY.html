fun new office update yet we are going
to be creating yes every one here is a
creator we're going to be creating our
new cutlery and dishware for the new
office which will help me keep track of
who it is who does crap like this well
they're gonna have their name on the
dish so I'm gonna know who was
Kable mod premium sleeved cables they're
still just as good as they were before
when we reviewed them and now they're
available for Coolermaster power
supplies click on this box to learn more
yes everyone gets a full set and we're
gonna be using these handy dandy payday
or what are they even I don't even know
what they are firm oh hardening
water-based color they're like they're
like paint pens so we'll be using these
and everyone will draw their own design
on their plate then we're gonna bake
them in the oven they should in theory
be completely washer safe pretty cool
stuff Brendon you are up first
press tip repeatedly to start flow I
feel like I'm in kindergarten right I
have never been known for my neat
writing
well it's greatest boss it looks like
your two-year-old made it did you shake
it ah no I know that's gonna be
permanent oh god these squares are all
where's the waveform that's Nick version
of me
IKEA boy is 2001 blisteritos yeah it's
supposed to be fire that's less
depressing I guess we could do it
upstairs couldn't make it to be here so
you still have the burning razor blade
it is groaning oh I get it like cutting
videos yeah this is Nick's nickname for
me
get it nickname wait are you faking
people signing your plate
those are it's not fake if it's what
they would have written no those are all
from you those are just good job not
great job well it's just for finishing
my bowl of cereal so it's not really
that spectacular but I definitely
deserve a smiley face when the milk is
all gone
I'm just being honest is that dick bud
nope I don't know how that got there I
didn't do it good that's not something I
would do so you're gonna rip my idea
like right off yeah good start
keep going Wow come on finish it great
job great job yeah let's have a look at
what everyone came up with so first
we've got one of our new hires John who
has says prohibited liquids and age
three backwash oil vinegar tobacco very
nice his bull ah is uh and you just
recently got married in Las Vegas so I
guess that's why there's a chip in there
that's just inappropriate something
about Carolina Hurricanes hockey and
having actually won a Stanley Cup this
guy is not going to last long next up
we've got the slice master this is
Terrence gear he's got a definite theme
going on and it's all about cutting I am
really like in this one slice master mm
next up we've got Brandon whose skills
with a camera are certainly better than
his skills with a pen I mean is that a
YouTube play button that's pathetic this
barely even looks like a film reel like
is that that's not even a circle does
this guy even know how cameras work we
don't even shoot on film anymore
and he likes spilled crap on it all
right next up we've got this is Nick
light sippin on some sizzurp there's a
Silicon Valley reference for those of
you who enjoy the show dad Acura logo Oh
accurate didn't be oh whatever don't
look the same to me and then dad Chetta
next up we've got Luke who went for a
more kind of abstract concept he's got
Sun and Sun and surf I think is what
that is and then something snowflake
we're all unique like a snowflake like
Luke Luke is a snowflake for us
speaking of tacky this could only be
Nick van Berkel
who completely ripped off my idea
the Cinco hotplate which involves
removing your teeth at some point in
order to use it and the ultimate MLG
plate mountain dew hitmarkers doritos
you you got it it's all there oh this is
Edie so this was actually a kind of a
cool idea in concept so it was like the
hand goes there but it just looks like a
house and add is our meme tacular winner
of the day I can't I have two rules
right no profanity and no sexual content
this actually turned out really good
Finn and Jake from adventure time
alright next up we've got our other new
team member Dennis I told him no
profanity and I'm sure that probably is
profane so he's fired - no he did the
outside he you know we actually have
Asians working here already but he's
coming in and he wants to be like the
Asian I don't even know what the hell
this is I mean I'll give him this he's
making progress if he wants to be the
most asian guy Atlanta's vehicle so I
actually asked for the employees to
decorate all of my stuff so you can see
they actually put a number one trophy
and world's best boss on my cup here
they came up with ten words to describe
me and then this good job for finishing
the cereal I'm really proud of the
effort that they put into this you know
just all these amazing things that they
wrote about me who the hell wrote that
I'm just being honest
this is why I had to do it myself and
this one I guess they ran out of a
flip-top lifting things so they just
tried to really drive the point home
apparently I'm the world's greatest boss
and the world's greatest boss also
delivered personalized cutlery that's
yours right there oh it's beautiful
so let's go to the office and see if
we've made any progress on the place
we're actually going to put these once
we bake them all right so we're coming
up on the office hopefully they've made
lots of progress I actually haven't been
here since last time you got little-
Media Group sighs yeah man
so I actually screwed these up a
quotation clearly said four inches by 18
inches and let me tell you I would know
18 inches and that is not 18 inches so
they actually just cemented the old one
on top of a original ones so let's see
what's changed so our yellow bins
getting pretty faux you know what I
think this is Brandon scrap our moving
helper has actually been throwing away
Brandon's stuff so I'll put this
somewhere I mean it can't be that
expensive but it's still inconvenient to
not have them okay Oh sprinkler system
all right so if there's a fire then
these will go off and ruin all of our
stuff this is the storage corner this is
mostly like computer cases and like
boxes for stuff that we've already done
are already in use that we're just going
to have to transport without the boxes
this is more set walls yeah that's all
happening it's all happening man these
are our new desks so everyone is getting
a motorized up desk so these are like
the fancy the fancy motorized sitting or
standing desks you can like dial in
presets and crap like that pretty
freakin cool
apparently we need to scissor lifts for
whatever it is we have going on here
right now but this my friends is where
the real progress has been made so we've
got a lot of people upset that there
isn't going to be a kitchen set at the
new place no there isn't but it's going
to be much much improved this is the
workshop which is going to be an actual
functional workshop you can see we've
got power outlets coming in it's
actually going to be more more desk all
along here up to about here and then
like more shelving units in the bottom
and it will also be a workshop set like
just
of a fun cool rustic looking workshop
set so we've got an actual blackboard
back here so you can go ahead and like
you could like right cool stuff on it or
whatever and then this is reclaimed wood
from the disassembly of like 60 pallets
so this has been clear-coated and put on
for like a really a really raw
cool-looking finish and we actually did
more reclaimed wood this my friends is
the Len show set so these were stained a
bunch of different colors for also like
a really cool look and then we're doing
a different finish on this wall because
this is just the noise dampening
cellulose foam on the wall so we have
made legit progress on the set pieces on
this wall it is I am like really pleased
with how these walther balls turned out
I'm really excited this is where the
HVAC is going up to the roof where the
air conditioning unit will be installed
so that is totally happening so they
have actually filled in the floor where
the where the kitchen plumbing has been
run over to where the kitchens going to
be so the kitchen can start coming in
very very shortly here you can see all
this is all this is done here that's
cool stuff also let's see what's going
down upstairs so the library hasn't
changed at all in terms of the layout
but we actually have a plan for what's
going to go in here so we're getting a
sectional here with like an end table on
either side so you'll actually be able
to like lounge and right over here I in
this corner we're going to put like I
think a built-in bookcase with like cool
knickknacks like loot crate stuff and
like awards that Linus media group has
won like our subscriber award cool stuff
like that over here is some kind of desk
so people can either sit on I think
there's going to be a little chair their
sectional there or a desk here too -
right and and have some you know private
time there's a lot more Ethernet in the
server room now so that's pretty cool
not sure where all of this is going to
but this is all new this must be
downstairs
oh they're labeled look at that top half
stairs
what the hell is this supposed to be I
don't think this is in the spec I
thought the server room was just
supposed to go all the way back nope I
farted don't inhale as you walk through
it so another room that hasn't actually
changed in terms of the progress that's
been made on it but has changed in terms
of the plan is the meeting room we
discovered that in order to have enough
room for chairs to move back and a table
our table was going to be 24 inches wide
which is pretty stupid for a conference
room table new plan we are turning this
thing where we drywalled over some
features of the building in the front
we're going to raise this and turn it
into bench seating so the conference
table will be here and there will be
chairs on the other side so you will
either have chairs or bench seating and
then we'll actually Salvage back the yes
base that we needed here's something new
we looked into buying something like
this to hold see stems and flags and
basically we found one place that had
them for like 600 or 700 dollars u.s.
and they wouldn't even ship to Canada
these are hard to find
apparently easy to just build so the
same contractor who did the sets over
there actually put together this rolling
sea stand holder for us freaking awesome
brandon is going to spaz when he sees
this because this is going to be just
great for moving the stuff around
especially once you've loaded it up with
like ten of these suckers which are
pretty heavy by the way I like c-stands
I think that they're very expensive for
what they are and this is a piece that
isn't actually new in the sense that
we've had it for a little while but it's
new in that it's much closer to its home
so this is our 42 u server cabinet from
Norco Technologies and it is it's still
it's still wrapped but I'm excited to
take it off so I can go and hide inside
it because that'll be super duper cool
