bastards that brought us that tiny
little windows-based gaming machine we
have got this should be one of the first
units as far as I know the GPD
XD plus and if you're wondering was that
intentional the answer is yes yes it was
and this is actually the least bizarre
thing about the Box because I don't know
what the hell that is supposed to mean
when you smile the world loves him when
you laugh the world fears him maybe it's
a riddle maybe it's some kind of probe
herb maybe it just was random words from
a dictionary like this it's hard to tell
but what I do know is that this thing
looks pretty freaking cool it's an
Android based gaming device and we are
gonna put it through the paces after I
tell you about tunnel they're the easy
to use VPN app that makes it so people
can enjoy a more open Internet to try
Humble bear for free go to tunnel bear
comm /l tt
alright first things first let's get
this baby fired up so it's pretty
similar in terms of the actual
construction of it to the original GPD
XD which is also an Android based gaming
device but they have made some upgrades
under the hood to make it a little bit
more robust so first let's run through
it just for those of you who aren't
familiar bottom is pretty plain you've
got an r1 r2 l1 and l2 that for whatever
reason all of these are upside down so
you're apparently supposed to look at
them this way okay sure it's got a
headphone jack which you cannot take for
granted these days it's got a mini HDMI
output that is HDMI 2.0 they say in the
specs but then they also say hdmi 2.0
max 2560 by 1600 resolution maybe it's a
software limitation micro USB still for
charging so that's how you can tell
there were a couple things they did not
update about the chassis and micro sd
other than that we've got this it's gone
oh hey there it goes okay so we've got a
couple of joysticks that are actually
not too shabby like as far as low
profile joysticks go that's not bad
we've got an l3 and an r3 volume up
volume down let's make some adjustments
there there we go
multitask button you've got whatever
this button does not clear not clear
what this button does start select back
home which and we've got a d-pad and
actually some not bad buttons here as
well now challenge number one challenge
number one for me is that it ships in
Chinese which has some what appeared to
be some like pirated ass games on it I
don't know what moopan 64 pluses I don't
know what that says something about
detected problem well that's an English
I wasn't taking it for granted so it
apparently ships with this wow that is
some pretty sketchy stuff right there
but hey let's try it out right --always
Yoshi if you pick any one other than
Yoshi and Mario 64 then you suck or
you're playing with me
because I would have worked pretty hard
to snipe Yoshi oh I'm dropping a couple
frames here but it's actually not too
bad so I don't know why that is right
now I haven't actually obviously spent a
lot of time with it I don't know if
there's any tuning that I can do I've
really got to get my Mario Kart game on
here because this is not pretty to watch
for there's seven seven a game streamer
I'm not experienced with like trying to
play the game while talking eat that
Luigi thank you oh go away toad you suck
you suck everything about you sucks Oh
terrible terrible terrible terrible Oh
No okay so that's enough moopan Lupin
Kart 64 here let's have a look at some
of the other stuff they got going on
here apparently wow this thing is like
pirated AF okay
if this thing manages to impress me in
Super Mario World then they have a good
product on their hands here because I
have I have not had a great experience
with Super Mario World on Android
emulators so far and I'm pretty
sensitive to input lag in this game so
let's have a look here trust me I'm
actually pretty good at this game there
we go
this the buttons are reversed oh wow the
button mapping ooh
oh right okay where are the settings for
this emulator all right yeah this is
Chinese is all Health also the input lag
is not great something's not playable
it's not playable I don't know if it's
in the emulators themselves or if it's
in the manufacturers of the devices but
there's a lot of room to improve this
experience and some people like if
you're super basic then I guess that's
fine but well we've only got one piece
one about one thing in here
see I had su / Hatsune sure let's go
with difficult I'm sure this thing is
gonna kick my ass wait well I don't know
what the buttons do Brandon oh okay so
we've got they like electricity whip now
that's pretty dope yeah you eat you
can't do yeah
thank you electricity went loving it so
overall performance in the included
emulators is actually pretty good and 64
we struggled a little bit but Super
Famicom the joysticks feel good still
d-pad is actually pretty good it's hard
to find a decent d-pad these days and
the buttons are reasonably clicky all
considering like how low-profile the
whole thing feels in terms of
performance they've got some decent
specs under the hood on this thing so
it's a mediatek 81 76 4 gigs of ram
they're using a power v r GX 2650 we've
upgraded the storage to emmc 5.0 so
launch times actually feel pretty darn
snappy about as good as you can expect
for a device that's you know this kind
of a cost but so far I have one small
problem still I can't figure out how to
get out of this interface this like
Metro UI type thing and I can't figure
out how to change the language so I have
to call in a specialist here now I can't
tell the difference last one day I'm
gonne forget how this became you know
doesn't return a kiss because you're not
gonna forget
oh there we go so we can change the
launcher in those settings so this is a
more conventional Android launcher
here's all your apps what's that yes
yeah it's fine out here okay so can we
taste your language to English oh yeah
you can't change it does it say change
to English in Chinese because normally
it says it in the oh there we go English
okay okay okay okay thank you
so overall impressions now that I've got
it running in English actually not a bad
little device there's still a lot of
stuff that's not translated to be very
clear I mean look at this like all the
game names under the emulator menu are
still in Chinese for the Super Famicom
same for the n64 like to be clear I
would prefer if there was something like
a Gen 2 of an Nvidia shield but for the
price you're paying it's not bad if
you're willing to go and like manually
add Google Play services and the Google
Play Store and all that stuff because
the hardware's pretty good it's got a
six thousand milliamp hour battery so
whether you're running Android games
which should run better than last gen or
whether you're running emulators which
mostly should run better than last gen
but certain ones like Nintendo dolphin
or Wii emulators won't run because they
require a 64-bit processor screen is
actually surprisingly good so it's a
720p screen which personally I think is
fine for a size like this it's IPS it
supports five-point multi-touch the
storage I mentioned before is 32 gigs
and it's expandable via microSD so I
don't think you're gonna find yourself
disappointed
if you're looking for a little device to
play casual games and emulators on that
you can throw in your pocket carry
around with you not worry too much about
busting up because I don't think it's
gonna be that expensive speaking of not
being that expensive ting the mobile
carrier that puts customer satisfaction
first with ting you do not get put in a
robot customer service rep tree instead
you speak directly to a human if you
have any
shoes and you do not pay a premium for
that kind of service
the average ting bill is just 23 bucks a
month per device and that's because you
only pay for exactly the airtime that
you use and they've got new lower mobile
data rates as well the best part about
ting is you don't have to take a leap of
faith you just head over to Linus
king.com and use their savings
calculator plug in your last couple of
months of bills to find out if you'll
save on ting and the best part is if you
use our link which we've got in the
video description you will save 25 bucks
on your first bill or you can get 25
bucks towards a new device so go check
it out now so thanks for watching guys
