box this is the Patriot g2 series with
as you may or may not recall I recently
took a look at a more sort of
down-to-earth configuration so this one
that I I checked out a couple days ago
was actually an 8 gig 2 by 4 gig kit yep
we're done with that here we are this is
the 8 gig single module which is
available in single module dual channel
and triple channel kits but I have six
total single modules yes Patriot in an
exclusive industry-first groundbreaking
manner has released a gaming spec a
gaming oriented g2 series designed for
Intel six series platform SKU with 8 gig
single dims so that means that in my
hand right now is 8 gigs on a single
module just like this these are not like
double stacked memory chips or anything
special like that these are just very
very high density modules so here you
can see these are 1333 9 9 9 24 x 8 gig
module these run at 1.5 volts yes these
are relatively low voltage modules -
very cool so in my hand right now I'm
holding 48 gigabytes of memory so that's
a similar amount of sheer storage space
as you would find on an entry-level SSD
not that long ago now they're not cheap
but I just wanted to sort of break this
news to you guys that patreon has 8 gig
modules and I'm going to be doing a
follow-up video where I actually take an
x58 motherboard and we're gonna find out
if we can even run 6 modules that is
forty eight gigs of memory on a single
x58 board and then we're also going to
try a z68 board to find out if we can
run 32 gigs of memory on one of those so
let's find out how well modern boards
accept this brand new memory density
from Patriot</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
