new killer nic over the last couple days
also released an update to the killer
zeno pro so they've given their whole
new software suite to existing zeno pro
user so i just wanted to take a quick
look at what they've enabled on the xeno
pro so you can see that it's sudden it's
got a far more complicated console now
and okay we've got a PC monitor where it
shows me the I oh yeah I can view any
number of things I can view pings I can
view help how much of my processor is
being used so right now I'm actually
rendering video so it's pegged at around
forty forty-five percent which is
because windows live movie maker can
only use up to i believe it's off or
threads and this is a 12 thread cpu i
can see how much of my networking
processing unit is being used right now
very very little I can also check my
internet bandwidth regular and offloaded
bandwidth whatever that means i am not
entirely sure okay i can see my current
system memory usage which is pegged at
about thirty percent and then i can see
my career frames per second which would
only be valid if you're doing something
that actually measures frames per second
in this case probably rendering video
yeah you can see I got fraps go in there
as well okay and then what else do we
got ping okay we already showed that
okay i'll get to that one after then
we've got network so you can manually
set the stats for your network on this
case you're having trouble seeing it
because those boxes are weighted on my
camera's being stupid let's see if it'll
focus for me here come on you can do it
you can do it I wonder if it'll let me
manually adjust the exposure here bear
with me I'm sorry about this yeah there
we go okay okay so there we go so I've
set it to 40 kilo bytes per second
upload and one thousand eight hundred
kilobytes per second download so you can
actually this is kind of cool because by
default it was set so that you had to do
it in bits and I was like yeah I don't
really know what my connection is in
bits so if you go into advanced you can
actually set all of the bandwidth units
as well as you
enable or disable things like the LED
glow on the card the default priority
for applications and then this this is
the cool one ok so this feature is a
lifesaver for me because I have more
than one pc on the home network and
whenever I upload YouTube videos so I'm
rien coding one right now and I'm also
uploading another one about my cats
whenever I upload YouTube videos it just
kills my network and I'm too much of a
network noob to figure out how to set up
quality of service on my router so
here's what I've done instead I can use
this application to manually set how
much upload bandwidth I want to Firefox
to have access to so I can just drag the
slider one way or another and I can say
okay max up to 25 kilobytes per second
max up to 30 kilobytes per second which
is kind of a happy medium it gives me a
decent upload speed and it also makes it
so that all the other computers on my
network don't have that really really
slow speed that you get when you have
your upload completely saturated so
that's pretty cool and then you can set
all of your other applications in terms
of I believe you can set priority as
well yep so there you've got your
priority settings here you've got
whatever allow and block is oh yeah I
guess you can block and allow it and
then you can set how much bandwidth they
have access to very cool feature and
i'll also be having a look at the new
killer 2100 as well in the next little
while so look forward to that but in the
meantime all zeno pro owners do have
access to this new application very very
cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
