powered by Western Digital our trusted
gaming gear partner is Corsair Vengeance
and our trusted retail partner is NCI
XCOM alright guys we just came by the
Xigmatek booth and the first thing I
noticed was actually this case oddly
enough it's called the Midgard 3 that's
not the oddly enough part but oddly
enough there's a battery symbol on top
I don't currently have the phone that
they used to display it with me but it
is a wireless charging station so
basically you come home slap your phone
on top of the case and I'll instantly
start charging that's actually pretty
cool I haven't seen any cases here that
have that functionality it's it's closed
off so there's no holes for fans except
along the side panels here I know it's
gonna be really really hard to see in
the camera so we're probably not gonna
get a good picture of it but their
spacing between the side panel and the
big bezel of the case where the case
actually gets its air so there it's it's
still a sample it's not in production
yet that might be putting sound
dampening on the side panels but there
currently isn't I'm not actually gonna
show you guys the inside of the case
because I gotta said it's a sample it's
not very refined yet in the front flip
up cover right here we've got two USB
2.0 ports two USB 3.0 points front audio
headers reset switch and then up where
the wireless charging it yeah where the
wireless charging is there's a power
button moving on we've got the nebula
this is more of their home theater
angled case it's got a very very sharp
looking power button nice glossy top top
on there big thick steel panels and I'm
actually can get my buddy here to take
off the panel so we can see inside the
case if big that can you knock on that
for me for a sec big thick nice steel
panels it looks great there's actually
pretty good space for cable management
you can fit a big power supply in there
they have a really really really
low-profile cooler in there which is one
of theirs but you can actually put a
slightly taller profile cooler in there
if you'd want one of those as well if
you would like it's not that bad for
cable management I would tidy this one
up a little bit but it's absolutely not
that bad sorry about that guys you can
fit in about a 20 centimeter graphics
card in there I haven't tested it but
that's what they tell me and it looks
about right this case looks very very
sharp you can fit pretty much whatever
you want in there we've got hot saw base
for hard drives two of them
yeah we're gonna move on anyways this is
their silence optimized case and this is
my favorite one so far not the first one
that caught my eye but my favorite ones
so far I'm gonna keep the juicy things
for later but their front i/o is
actually covered up by this sliding
panel so which reveals a reset button
power button front audio two USB 2.0 and
two USB 3.0 fairly standard at this
point what isn't standard though and
I've only seen once more of this show
but this is possibly a better
implementation of it is having the top
covers down turns off the two top fans
but if you raise them up it's a sample
guys so let it hold for a sec there we
go if you raise them up there we go
the fans on the inside will turn on I
what I was doing wrong there so I was
pressing on the corner supposed to press
on both corners then it on clips so it
turns to the fans on if they're open so
if you need to do something like video
editing or gaming or anything heavy you
can have the table covers open which
turns the fans on if you wanted to be
quiet in your room because now you're
trying to go to bed you're done game
you're done video editing you're done
doing all the stuff you want to do every
day you can close the top covers down
then it gets very nice and quiet the
inside it's quite well refined this one
isn't actually built up so you can't see
how it would be when it's built up
there's a little bit of room behind the
motherboard panel I would like a little
bit more but I can kind of wedge my
fingers in there 24 pins should be fine
there's a definitely enough space back
here there's sound dampening on each one
of the panels as we can see here and
then this fan slot actually has extra
foam sound dampening on it so if you're
not going to put a fan there you can
keep this stock sitting in there and it
won't be a big deal moving onward we get
into there they're very small
form-factor cases I'm sure you guys can
recognize what case the akela is going
up against because it looks very similar
to it but these crossbars are supposed
to be very strong this is a sample so
I'm not going to test it because
breaking a sample is a lot of money but
they have very nice cable management
options down here and you can fit
full-sized power supplies so if you do
have a full-sized power supply you can
tie everything down here again I might
do a little bit better of a job but you
can tie everything down here and it look
very very nice put a huge cooler in
there fit full-sized graphics cards put
a pretty beast machine in here
especially with Haswell running very low
power
not putting out that much heat if you
clock it correctly you can build a
really really beast machine in a system
