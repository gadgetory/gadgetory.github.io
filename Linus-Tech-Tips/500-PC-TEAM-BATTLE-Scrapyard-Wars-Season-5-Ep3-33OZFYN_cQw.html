that my phone died
i'ma plugged into my battery bank now
okay 250 we can be there in about an
hour and a half is that does that work
for you Oh like 4:30 that would be about
4:30 can I get the exact address now and
then I can give you a little more
accurate ETA fantastic okay awesome
let's do a deal so how much is it total
we'll go ahead and ejected and mortising
you said 180 for the i7 system why is
there hard drive right in here it seems
for the SSC and then what else did we
what else did we take um
level 2 the pants that was it really
you're gonna charge him all the fan now
peridot plugin charge ago too bad I was
you're asking office looking like he's
only charging me for the pen cuz I told
them it was worth something
paper damn
so it's 195 195 okay I'll allow two I
have a window how much I could tour for
these things and that's free Center okay
okay so then we're good because yes he
did figure out who we were exactly
because your alias is good we're hands
aren't ash ketchum female is not
supposed to be used for Craigslist it's
just a burner email me now it's just a
burn nice to meet you you need to do
pictures oh yes definitely yes
definitely pretty sure thank you but
it's cool as long as we bought the
system square yeah we can't take an
advantage
I really don't think that could have
gone any better I'm gonna have a
possibly serviceable power supply yeah
so we got a thirty seven seventy eight
gigs of RAM I really wanted to succeed I
know but it just it won't help with the
benchmark you're right I know I get it
so we have CPU RAM motherboard case
maybe a power supply and we've got a
lead on a 980ti for 250 bucks that we
are going to start driving to get to
right now which is insanity so let's go
I will believe this graphics card when
it's like in our system and on and
doesn't crash before you run a benchmark
$250 for nine yet and like he calls you
you say we have one for 275 that's far
away that we are willing to get can you
price it at the same amount and he says
no it's cheaper and it's also
water-cooled like I don't I don't I
think he just wants to live it so we
left there with almost a full system it
just didn't have a graphics card and the
power supply was a little sketchy but
while we were there
Linus got a call with a lead for a 980ti
so our plan at that point was just to go
and we secured a deal where we could
come back to CSS possibly and buy
another power supply if we need to do
some weird power supplies or something
and we took off an hour and a half to
somewhere completely different to pick
up a 980 TI that happened to be
water-cooled man that was sick Paul and
Kyle might be able to hear me through
the door so I'm trying to keep this down
but that was awesome of that everything
let's go entire store on sale I want to
go to Radio Shack can we go to Radio
Shack we're leaving yeah little radio
show no one who said no okay
could you be left for the day okay so
what we have to know then though is I
see there's a little note in the box
when did you figure out who we were
ah thing is though I didn't know what's
going to be you or not if your voice is
a little different it is imperative that
we would have done this deal for 250 for
someone else
yeah every kind of so people okay what
when was the first time you post on
Craigslist like so you see okay you know
well okay how many people are gaming
okay okay so that's fine look we're
really good yeah we would have been
would have killed us to to arrive here
and find out we couldn't buy this from
you who services okay so we actually
need to make a decision right now on the
power supply do we take the power supply
which gives us 15 dollars per 16 is it
possible that we could pick up the power
supply tomorrow if we decide me right I
think I think we should take it I think
you're wrong
I don't think I think you're wrong I
think this home I wrong you're wrong in
that I really don't think that
Thermaltake is good about it but if it
does work then we have I guess he
already knows anyways if it does work
then we have 45 dollars for our GB which
is like pretty wicked
10% man-portable six benchmarking build
tonight forward of the six benchmarks
are gaming yep okay this has a water
cooler on it we can probably make up our
stupid 10% just by being able to power
it properly and we can find leaves on
the side of the road buy some flowers
for four bucks for red and more flowers
for blue if we like cut a hole in the
side panel have the flowers coming up
create in RK fine I think we can pass
whatever man okay sorry graphics card
power supply I'm sorry Bert we've never
actually worked together on this before
so we're discovering that person we
really don't get along that we were
really worried about the power supply
because if we've got a 980ti
but couldn't power it we have a super
amazing computer that can't complete any
benchmarks that we end up disqualified
we have $15 left for RGB lighting or do
you just want to get your RAM when we do
leave yeah I could get my ramp
I want my Randy thank you thank you for
talking about I figured that was coming
is that the air and you were running
where you go grabbing Sharpie books
people see
okay but you gotta tell me where you're
grabbing sharpies just in case just in
case okay you never know we might have
to like write a contract or something
okay okay all right all right if nothing
else he seems pretty adamant yeah and
that is a fresh package of Sharpie yes
it is ah you know what I'm I'm going
with it his story is good and on the
phone he let nothing yeah I'll give you
that
on the foot like he was even confusing
and stuff he knew us the theory there is
that he didn't know us right away we
ended up calling him a whole bunch of
times and very frantically unlike almost
anyone would and with Linus's voice so
the theory is that he didn't figure it
out until after he offered us everything
and after we had finalized pricing
because the idea in our heads is that he
went back and watched some YouTube
videos and then was like yeah that is
his voice for sure and then went out and
bought sharpies and that's why he was
late for the Meetup because he figured
it out way later on there's an hour half
window there where he could have figured
it out
and he swears up and down that he would
have sold it for that much to anyone
because he's been trying to sell it for
two weeks and hasn't been able to move
it okay so I did grab the note which was
still on the seat of his car so let's
see what it says it's a huge fan Linus
hope you win would would he gamble and
put a note in the box thinking okay some
random that person's you know more than
almost anything else
yeah so I don't I don't think we're in
the wrong I don't like it yeah I don't
have to like and if Paul and Kyle are a
little salty
I'll get it but we also have done our
due diligence okay so we might have a
slight change of plans here instead of
you going to pick up well first off I
just found this ad on Craigslist
twenty-five dollars for a 64 gig SSD
which would be exactly what we're
looking for twenty-five dollars five
dollars out of our budget though we only
have twenty bucks for an SSD so what I'm
thinking is instead of you going to
Rancho to pick up that RGB strip for ten
just maybe cancel on that guy and use
five of those dollars to get this SSD
you can use the other five you have a
great idea earlier instead of using RGB
LEDs if we just spent five bucks on like
red multicolored like electrical tape
and we could just tape up the case the
system make it look nice do some racing
stripes type of things and we can block
over any open holes or anything yeah
exactly the other good thing about this
place is if they're available today
they're sort of in the same area where
at least the same direction as micro
centers you could also save us some
times that of us having to split off
right now in different directions so you
work you work some magic yesterday with
the 980ti
I think you should try it on this guy
and see if you can get one for 20 that's
good that so the 64 gigas actually I
think this is the guy Z who called
yesterday okay I remember he was like oh
man I hope you guys do if we can find
him or whatever but it didn't sound like
he was going to budge okay I'm hoping to
God that he's not sold out of them
because I can't remember he mentioned
that yesterday on the phone like that's
why he couldn't help us or if it was a
budget thing he says several several
sounds like yeah and was supposed to
that week ago so I think we might still
be in the clear okay so I'm gonna give
him a car down
you know in hindsight I really wish that
I had exact change for the 980ti guy
because that would mean we technically
have five extra dollars at our disposal
but we know technically since Linus
never gave us the money to spend and
we're using your money wasn't that your
money that you tipped him with and not
the money from the copy technically once
yeah that was my money that was in my
pocket that seems perfectly clear to me
in my pants so I think that was my money
I think anything in your pants should be
fair dance does that mean we can now
offer five extra dollars to any offer
that we attach to an SSD right now uh
let's ask the audience what do you think
audience is where you shake the camera
you should up and down to make the guest
motion no that looks like I know what
you're doing right now but you gotta go
all right there we go now we're talking
all right
five dollars here we go I've seen - do
shady or shit on the show that's a good
point obviously if he had just given us
the money up front rather than leaving
it in the bathroom at the hotel I've
been way more concrete it would be no
debate yeah I think he purposely left it
open just to see how we would react it's
sort of a social experiment he's seeing
if we can strategize this and find a way
to work around his mistakes I think
actually that would mean we have six
extra dollars if you give an extra
dollar to the case guy I did in ten
instead of night okay I'm gonna start
making $26 offers on SSD beautiful
on Africa we have found in TV a course
there were strive says it's open box but
never been used subjects it was fast
drive and I've been 20 gigs 30 bucks in
Whittier which is pretty close to here
but there's only make offer options so
we had to send him a message through the
website wait no idea if he's actually
going to respond but it was only posted
two days ago so seems seems like a
viable possibility he also has five
five-star reviews that's good too
I am having some success as far as
finding listings with an offer up I
haven't used before but very similar to
let go cuz people take a quick picture
posted and 180 gig 180 miles away course
that Coursera one I've reached out to
about five or six people so far which is
some quick messages just a few more here
now that I've expanded the search range
but we only have to drive to farming on
that much time it's like as soon as
possible you gotta get windows started
to load games good to go we now have
about four and a half hours left until
we're supposed in okay okay this is the
possibility we have us we ever apply two
minutes ago
uh eighty gig Intel for twenty five
Donna can pick up anytime
I saw that this is the one immediately
the aggression will split up really
quick I'll do the other two Micro Center
you can get the drive two-thirds of the
competition god I think we're pretty
good shape I think we have a pretty good
amount of hardware going on obviously we
have some some hurdles to get past a day
gotta get the SSD set I've gotta get
windows installed got to do some modding
got to handle the RGB stuff so we have a
lot of work ahead of us but we do have I
think a decent amount of time I feel
like we're where we should be at this
point in the competition so very
optimistic I think and we also have some
bribes for the judge so we need to make
this sit in here more actually more
active that's true this is more
important than that
in order to do this we will require some
code that's fine to do this we need
power tools like this one
Black &amp;amp; Decker that I'm going to try to
do this first a little bit more
precision we do it I do have a jigsaw
available to if the dremel rotary tool
it's not a dremel but it is really tool
doesn't work than the lot the big guns
go to jigsaw completely differently than
what Paul's been working on I started
with $20 he was like that's way too low
I offered 30 and he said the lowest I
can do is 35 he's all the way in Fontana
so I was like if I can drive 45 minutes
to you please if you can do $30 I will
drive all the way to you he said finally
okay I'll take 30 and he's going to meet
me at Best Buy in orange so it's closer
to me beautiful that is okay so much
better so so right now right now well I
actually haven't confirmed when but
that's the only thing that could screw
this up is if he's like I can't meet a
like 5 p.m. or something because we need
it now
if you keep repairing that you can meet
this in the next hour go go go and I'll
tell Huntington Beach guy that that
we're going to back out or you could
just go go go anyway we'll wait to be ji
response you're going the same direction
for both of them so that's good okay so
actually we have we have two options now
for SSDs we can go Paul's route for 80
gig SSD $25 or we can go $30 for a 128
gig SSD on my end your your guy would
save us $5 and you can put that towards
more RGB tape for the system so even
though it's a bit further away it might
be worth it so the bombs is it's off
Edinger and that's the same eggs that
you get off of to go to micro Center so
it's probably just west of a okay then
Jason okay then I'm asking what time he
can meet and tired ace asked 1 p.m. 1
p.m. he said cool yes we can meet up at
bonds or Springdale and years
okay you just go right now okay I'm
gonna get I should probably go straight
there then right yeah before I hit my
croissant that's right here now I get to
tell this guy like hey all that haggling
this do your way um never mind and
messages to you now don't burn my bridge
just yet just in case this guy doesn't
work out so I'm emailing to you which
email should I send it was just yeah
actually do you have another one see
good snap off oh look at that vehicle
it'll do the next thing which is bend in
and out of the way all right no it's not
lining up I don't know I'm an idiot I'm
an idiot
and then I measure for the top DQ damn
it you did do a little bit more cutting
I measured for the top PCI rocket 1x not
just about the second PCIe bracket which
is actually 16 X 2 the Cardinal images
no worries
yes yeah hahaha fuck yeah
wait ready yep no dude I'm becoming more
and more happy with with the casemod
that we did here
you know slipshod though it may be look
it's acting as a GPU support right there
its resting look at this big-ass GPU
triple slot design normally you'd be
drooping down like a lipstick but now
it's just direct I guess so this is this
is really temporary and honestly just
because I'm just trying to figure out
some solution we have two five and
quarter inch open bays at the front the
case did not come with the covers for
it's going to be there's gonna be a new
trend I think people are going to start
doing this until it's going to have a
ton of pressure on them to make like
really nice-looking few bucks which
you've seen on display so I just got
back I got a couple things one of which
is the 80 gig SSD that we currently have
windows loading on right now it's
installing it is functional Windows is
installed onto it so it just loaded I
got to do driver updates and get
everything transferred over as far as
games and tests from this system okay so
we've got all of our expenses entered
now and everything seems to be kosher
here's everything we've got so far we've
got our Craigslist ad screenshot it in
our invoice is entered and we've got
fifteen dollars left for everything we
could possibly need to put together our
machine and take a shot at the 10
percent RGB builder's hit me with it you
got first so a couple things I'm getting
all of our software and games for all
the benchmarking later so it because our
benchmarking as fast as possible second
thing uh-huh
second thing I located a grocery store
that is rather close so if we still want
to go with the flowers idea we can do
that I was sort of thinking we could
punch a hole in the side panel and have
the flowers like coming out of the case
bread cleaning with flowers yeah okay
which should be actually like not that
hard to get a different colors let me
hit you with an idea I had this morning
he's been on you've been on the Craig
Peyer you yell in the Craig's List I
haven't heard back from anybody yet okay
but wouldn't you imagine that
in late March Christmas lights might be
pretty cheap oh my god um yeah and blue
is actually not that uncommon for
Christmas light so I haven't heard back
from anybody yet but I also found
another lead check out this place LED
for everything gone mom God is located
15 minutes from here here's an RGB
waterproof LED strip kit with controller
that would love tax on in dollars it
will hold on hold on but what I'm
thinking is we don't need ah what is
this
this is a five liter roll oh wow
so we could show up there as we like
okay we'll take like scrap strips we
have $15 can you do it
would you rather do RGB LED strips or
like some weird thing with flowers
I don't know I'm torn I'd love to know
if strips with a controller are an
option like I feel better having the
lighting and then trying to figure out
if there's like some green like on a box
that we could cut out to look like I
don't know like do some decoration I
don't think we have a huge bid in the
RGB realm so my kind of concept is that
we're gonna get in Iran no I didn't say
that
because we have to win the like oh
that's creative oh you know I mean right
instead of to just like that's a really
good implementation of RGB I don't think
we're going to win that vote or whatever
do Christmas light we could go straight
cancer
and we could buy five meters of lights
and just wrap them up football and check
them in there like I'm sure those guys
are going to have real RGB lighting we
decided to go a different route instead
of RGB lighting altogether we're just
gonna use tape because I think it's a
little bit clever and quite frankly LED
lights are a little bit overplayed like
it's like I took a class on this or
something it's just so so beautiful
things are proceeding with the system
itself SSDs installed I'm going to tuck
that stuff in there and cycling on panel
on Wednesday I'll finish with it well I
got all freaked out for a minute
when I first installed Windows if it was
really sluggish like doing anything just
pulling up the Windows menu it seemed
like it was just like I would click
windows many it would take 5 or 10
seconds before would actually plug I
think it was just doing background
Windows 10 initial installation setup
stuff at that time and there was no wife
or no internet at first but that kicked
in - so I had to do a couple restarts
but now everything seems back at the
speed I just installed steam I got a
copy games and I also did drivers on
this and will do that right now the only
thing I can think to do is kind of
create this staggered effect with the
various colors that we have and then I'm
going to work my way inward I also kinda
want to do some sort of fun border
around the window itself but I'm just
kind of letting the ideas come to me but
it's very time consuming I'm just hoping
that it will eventually pay off oh I
just could say I wish I had a magnetic
thing to put on these pieces
well I fix it sponsor me okay
Oh security measures fine
why do you drop him they didn't I didn't
drop it I put it down really fast
did you hear an impact yes on your foot
yeah I put it down on my foot really
fast if I'll get it yeah no problem
you didn't used to drop everything now
you had said you were thinking radiator
on the bottom but I got to tell you I'm
actually no no it's the door on the door
on the side panel that's fine now we
find that I'll be fine and we could do
some cool mod anyways where they like
come out of the door a little bit if we
really wanted to do something like that
yeah and then as an intake we could like
okay yeah yeah I can do that cut like
yeah I think intakes all along here and
then this might actually end up being
somewhat useful as an intake another
option is like this seems to be multiple
pieces here but this tops off whatever
this is what happens if we take this out
I wonder if it ends up looking really
cool
oh yeah that might not look that good
okay well let me let me finish this
anyway cuz you're in a mob that face
that you want to though yeah possibly so
this does not look good know how to
mount the power plant okay so you said
you had an idea I have one that you're
not gonna like so you go first
I want to hear the idea I'm not gonna
like if we decide that we don't need
this absolutely we test everything out
of the system everything's fine yeah
like I think this is actually the versus
doing a dual power supply like janky
thing where we have to you don't have a
jumper we'd have to pay like $10 for one
of those power supply dual PSU jumper
things yeah which we have but like
really I think this is a better bet to
run this whole system so okay so if we
decide we don't need that we decide we
don't need this yeah we could there's
space here we could open the top up
shear the back off cut a hole around it
and make a mounting plate with this
using these screw holes that are already
nicely threaded why wouldn't I like that
that was the same idea I was going to
pitch here look at how much clearance
there is inside here yeah and then just
like it should cut a hole in here for
the modular interface that would be
easier so I'm going to have to not
destroy it but like definitely use a
soldering iron and dismantle it I wanted
to come at it hi I'm just wondering I
was looking at your 3 5 to 8 RGB
waterproof LED strip kit and I was just
thinking like I don't need the power
supply and I don't need that many LEDs
so I was just wondering if you guys had
like cheaper options if you don't need
as many things like maybe you just have
some scrap RGB LED strips around and
don't need those can we just get those
in a clicker oh but it's your Nate
can we move the power from the cassette
so they will be cheaper yeah okay we
have about 15 bucks
exactly nothing nothing at like we'd
like we have a five and we have a ten
and that is the total amount of money
that we have what do you think we could
get for that Oh actually for $15 so the
leaners you want us to ship it to you or
you know we can we can come take it out
for sure if you can take us our
locations we can just to what this card
you can just buy the entire 50 give your
algebra cassette for $15 with the power
supply so cash no - oh no - yeah it's
like a $15 fit yeah
okay okay I think we've got a deal what
was the address
hey man I thought we were only doing the
bottom
right my bad
I think it did the same thing you did oh
shoot okay another goal was definite hi
in other news our stress test both I 264
for the CPU and combustor plasma for the
GPU are going strong and GPUs at 43
degrees yeah that was with the front
completely off yeah and the side off oh
no no I know I know no no this isn't
like there's not final temps I just mean
everything's running smoothly and right
like worst case scenario we leave the
side panel off and we just fill it with
RGB and we lose RGB and then we destroy
anything yes what we're talking about
how classy our victory is going to be at
this point it does matter which doesn't
look terrible okay about what there's AC
in the garage you use I didn't know this
it is frickin hot in here I would have
turned it on I told you yesterday that
it exists
okay well I don't know how to cut it out
you haven't watched my garage work long
been money no I sure haven't we don't
need to put anything on it hard you're
doing averages we have an 80 gig SSD oh
we actually have to put the games on the
hard drive I thought we were just
running them from the from the external
no if they 5 it's not he's one of you
guys by bad part on Franklin
working to get that funny guys if you
buy a bad part yeah look great or if it
breaks our rule has always been you got
to do with no one's ever done that well
people have broken things you may recall
that in scrapyard wars season 4 I broke
a motherboard and then had to repair it
I mean are they going to not have it you
know what yeah I'm feeling pretty
charitable if they got a broken part
should be it yeah yeah you know what
that's that's the confidence level of
insurance
let's go buy our second 1080p I yeah
yeah let's do that
that yeah in this case today it would be
that you like get the money back and you
can recoup reuse the money I guess oh I
see but that won't help us out my chain
a scam is great so clean the case power
spine out radiator mount for the front
which is basically just a matter of
drilling a few holes side panel windows
ah to of no because I found this thing
under here Oh seriously
yeah actually like slightly bigger -
nice so we have 2 side panel windows
from the power supply nice so we have
like a couple strategically placed
classy windows yes
so front vent cover mod we have to do
that and then we have to replace the fan
connectors so I'm going to like assign
things cuz I look pretty good sure okay
we're not going to get back from our RGB
errands until a little after - I still
don't have all the games installed and
oh install games that we can maybe team
work that once we're done the actual
cervical assembly because I'm not going
to want to overclock the GPU till we've
got the side panel back
okay all right let's go get some RGB
strips oh sure okay hello hello we
called in earlier 5050 for 15 bucks okay
so we got our clicker which something
works super well but it works enough for
us there's our five meters of LEDs power
adapter IR receiver power cable
everything's good we are good to go and
our fresh books expenses total five
hundred US dollars exactly not a penny
to spare
so I'm Gerson three to heaven you get
some noms and let's get these installed
I love that we have five meters of our
gg what if we just like it has adhesive
backing right what if we just take our
five meters and just put an insane
amount of it on the outside and just
feel like we have the most RGB you
should get the highest score because we
have the most RGB it is a score rating
remember they asked like what are the
different categories and we were just
like RGB bearing in mind who our
celebrity judges I think we both know
that isn't going to fly
there's your approximate cut out for the
window turn that into straight line
it's a Proxima in a hurry okay thanks
dude so we we have a we have a kind of a
like the one part and you think it's
just that throwaway item that you don't
even have to worry about 16 gauge drive
we got it from the wholesale place they
got opted into a toaster and tested
while we're there pulled up crystal disc
info and it was fine it was recognizing
but he didn't eject it or do anything he
just pulled the drive out of the thing
while it was still spinning and I was
like but I should have said something
more to be honest but now that drive is
not showing up anywhere in device
manager so we are kind of we have
problems we only have an 80 gig SSD and
we still have GTA 5 and for ours to drop
and those are like I mean we need the
drive the space on the mechanical drive
so we will need to either there
ourselves at the mercy of Linus who's
always been Evelyn sand forgiving and
not take this advantage at all or we
could send Edie into the garage to grab
one of the existing hundred and sixty
gig drives that I have in there that are
completely functional and cheap does it
count if we give Eddie ten dollars for
the hard drive well if we just give
Eddie ten dollars yeah Eddie
you want ten dollars funds you have that
way it's legit and not cheating at all
yeah I mean at this point like we're not
going to get away with anything
oh yeah any chance because that was
ruined when we like let Eddie Deportes
repair that shady plan I think we should
talk to Linus first okay
and just see what he says okay I think
this is an opportunity for team inba to
throw a bone to a team loser over there
if you guys can extract the drive you
can have it oh really yes is this is
this a trick is this a trap good trap is
that we are so great that we have enough
extra hardware to make up we're your
guys is failing okay so apparently - and
Luke have so much hardware according to
linus that this is actually an overflow
and they just handed this off to us they
said if we can extract the drive and it
worked properly then you know they
basically just throw us a bone so see if
this works i'm going to go ahead and
crack it open
this looks like a job for don't put a
barrier I fix it let's see so it looks
like you need I don't know what you call
that one but I know what it looks like
after Senate venture on world clock 24.6
cater here some CPU getting pretty warm
hitting mid to upper 80s on the cores to
actually core to hit 92 package hit 93
so that's about as warm as we want and I
don't think I can do anything further
about securing that CP cool or anything
more I think this is a big drawback at
the T 4 versus like a hyper 212 we did
hit 665 of far as a score goes so we're
probably okay but if they have any core
if they have a 4770 there didn't make it
30 even a 3770k that's overclocked and
we'll probably get beat there but if
they have a straight Club part I think
you have a pretty good chance
thanks I put it
so it's IDE we have an IDE to SATA now
oh you know what though I mean I do have
an idea to state a USB dot there's a get
a USB adapter let's just use that extra
and just have a drive external you can
still stick it in the case somehow now I
don't have well there's nowhere to rub
the plug in via USB
like what looks like a USB HID
the adapter plugs into like a USB cable
like that needs to plug into one of the
plugs on the back yeah has recently
although just plug it right straight in
front or why not oh so those might be
USB 1 which would severely on that
charge capability so what if we what if
we did USB 3 in the back yes 2 or 3 is
fine I don't even need that adapter
which I'm pretty sure is in the garage
and I don't think I know exactly where
it is again I'd have to go out there or
something
so together I would be what I have a big
idea where it is I mean I could send you
in there not you people on the camera
you had I could send you in there to
investigate if you want yeah it's you
can hunt it down go do our bidding
so coverage you remember the drawers in
the bottom just plastic drawers so
latest adapter works got IDE on that
side plugs in right there and then USB
and then it comes with a power adapter
to plug in like a molex plug there or
SATA but since we are going to try to
install this internally we can just use
one of the molex plug already in the
case hopefully that'll work
what if if we plugged into the back if
you wanted to just make it a little bit
more hidden but it'd be possible to like
just route the cable around maybe cut
out a little hole here and actually have
the drive in the climate we have we have
space spec thing like I was just going
to have it right here the adapter would
stick off right there
our design of the drive right here yeah
and then I can just feed that cable out
through one of these okay and plug it in
the back yeah
there we have a disk that we can
initialize all things the lines move
never mind
device is not ready one of the last time
you get really really excited that you
had a floppy connector here that's it at
the end of this at the end of this
modular cable there is a floppy
connector and I have no idea if this is
going to make a difference at all but I
can actually just plug this in to keep
in touch if they're going to look at
this what the hell is going on that hard
drive in there I think I might have done
it because when I plugged it in the
light came on on the adapter and they're
so plugged in here to the hard drive and
I'm looks back there to plug in the IDE
two USB adapters should be good
well the drive still says it's not ready
so I don't know what else to do to
attempt to get this drive to work it
came out of it you know to gate external
device whatever so my thoughts are
either that it's dead or there's some
something about functioning with it or
there is some advanced disk
initialization thing that I apparently
don't know how to do because I just keep
getting the devices not ready and yeah
so okay another goddamn hard drive I'm
gonna just start cutting this because
I'll go yeah go we don't we have no time
to measure PTAs installed okay
problem why I got like an inch cutting
this because now that I was going slow I
was letting the Dremel do the work and
everything it just like who so there's
just like a gash jig Oh have you ever
used a jigsaw but a long time I have
what about a an angle grinder you can
get one of those that would be great hey
Paul you have an angle grinder do you
have another cutting blade no angle
grinder thinks he might have another
like one more cutting blade but doesn't
know where it is it's the same type if
it's not a hardened cutting blade I'm
not going to answer
we're gonna bring it in let's have a
look at it it's pretty bad any idea how
we're going to cut the case I haven't
found anything that would work this
looks abominable yeah it looks pretty
terrible so basically no way to cut this
thin okay well what else is on the list
what else is a high priority for you
I've got front vent cover mod but like
I'm not a blade we can't and we can't
even like cut this which oh this is
aluminium okay we might have been able
to cut this but like yeah and then PSU
now okay get the power supply up maybe
disconnect all the modular table chair
okay well we've got 25 minutes to build
a computer that works and it already
works so this can't go that badly it's
just a matter of like our aesthetic
scores will be terrible yeah good I've
disconnected give me that I'll play with
ya you give the dr some salt yeah sure
and i got to get the rad installed -
should i even dust it maybe just go
outside and be like okay there you go we
have like an hour and a half two hours
we probably don't have time to go out
and get another drive we don't have
money left to go out and get another
drive so we're stuck trying to figure
out how to work that one or like we
really really had no other option so
thankfully linus offered us you know
threw us a bone and offered us this
Seagate enclosure that had a drive in it
that but pulling it out we found it was
IDE IDE drives having to have a
completely different connector that our
board doesn't even have tried to use a
USB adapter that one eventually also
turns out was bad and would not format
at all so yeah we really had no other
choice but to take extreme measures
it's recognized it's there neutralized
it's already initialized they need to be
initial it was already initialized and
formatted ooh so this is going to be
adapter yeah I powered it differently
but I think there is an issue with
plugging the power both to the drives
and to the adapter when it's connected
via USB something like that anyway on a
phone that this system reserved in local
disk image like that this is the this is
the IDE jive so that - said we can use
course why would it be anything else the
exact specific ID Drive you said you
guys use this Drive and we said ok line
is the WD grip cessful in the drive
dissipate a legit business
come on plugs did it get bumped today
it's switched off we want to thank you
ed for for joining our criminal group
our cabal or that's called sorry to your
incriminated but we appreciate you
risking everything to go and get us
another Drive you did get one that was
still IDE
we still appreciate that Tahoe somehow
it still had the same issue and we had
three drives that didn't work and so I
guess all it passes to say for any of
you at home we did what we did because
we had no other choice
Luke and Linus are almost done but
without any tools can they're RGB
solution make the cut and hard drive
treble pushes fallen Kyle to the limit
just how far will they go
to stay in the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
