pretty good because we can
Wow because we're 9s music this is not a
siren Pro this is a siren hearing that's
it I have evidence of you eating from it

part we have a bear motherboard aha we

an i/o shield and it's wireless antenna

videos to a minimum if I went to Taiwan
Oh Dennis I'll just pretend to speak
Mandarin like I knew what I was saying
shows confident but I was not seeing
anything if you tell us some things I
don't know what to say they simply means
to me say anything so Nick
that was something else about Merkel
it's not a good person did you hear that
Buerkle yes
he's not lying what's he carrying lately
comical
why'd you carry what are you doing oh my
goodness how many of these do we have
well found my company called Berk Tech
nice the label maker ran out of paper we
have another label maker and refill
somewhere I'm gonna just not change them
to get it out fix the job and just get
them cuz that's the kind of company we
are we don't refill the label maker just
buy a new one apparently you have I know
yeah refills I told them we have refills
no one's impressed by herons monitors my
monitors are freakin awesome and people
ask questions about them all the time
that is such a lie it's the monitor
graveyard is that typewriter for us for
the set it's pretty stuck out kids this
is why keyboards are it's not on a grid
because of the old typewriters you see
this so the arms can go through there
no one cares we're almost done inventory
like it's getting clumps yeah
Taron it's that day man what day is it
my last day no it's your first day of
not living
Nik is always threatening to kill me
like every day you blind as hell I can
oh I remember this this is when Brendan
was mad that I was using his shell so
Brendan how does this compare to Linus's
house looks kind of the same right now
right now it's still just as messy
change I can't believe that someone come
out there so Sam in our terror
Spanish no hablo espanol look at Brandon
ate all of those look at that look good
there by your desk I'm being framed good
actually have a cinco hat I do
pretty funny mm-hmm is that food for all
of us
oh yeah lemonade okay all right
chicken chicken that's right so the nice
little table you folks will set up here
I really needed this food now as a real
coffee addict I can't let this go to
waste
what did you do No Oh gross
ah how's this oh it's good but I'm so
tired and I need it oh very cool putting
in oh they're putting in windows so we
have to have like prison windows because
quite frankly the completely clear ones
with no mesh in them we're too expensive
if the glass is fire-rated
Oh which it has to be on the outside of
this structure well working for you is
like being in prison so I guess this is
just magic have you ever been to prison
teryn oh because if you had I think you
would have done a couple dogs what
happens if we have to get out and we
can't because there's bars against the
doors whatever he's going to be I'm
gonna be able to hold a fire alarm and
then and then not
you have to go against oh oh you can't
get rid of it that way uh hopefully I'm
not with you in a disaster oh I guess
we'll just die I just love it when
inventory has you know branding oh it
doesn't this literally just says just
yeah two HDMI that's not helpful
no the key to inventory is a good label
maker well putting the label on is also
important what the inspector has
officially been to the old location to
ensure that we are indeed not there and
we passed I caught it so this is the
tool shelf this is where we keep all of
our tools except usually it's almost
impossible to find one of these here
because people are always taking them
and using them for all kinds of things
because they have pretty much every
screwdriver bit under the Sun not to
mention a bunch of other handy dandy
tools you've got your try wings you got
your security you got your torques you
got your hexes you got this extension
that's flexible there's a bunch of other
cool stuff in here too the thing about I
fix it is they don't just provide great
guides for you know repairing or
disassembling your oh yeah this is cool
so this is the pen that comes with their
magnetic their magnetic screw holder
thing that I also use all the time they
provide detailed guides over at
ifixit.com so that you can with
confidence replace the screen in your
phone or take apart your iMac or do all
the kinds of things that I've personally
done with their site and with their
tools and you can get your own Pro Tech
tool kit and you can save ten bucks off
an order of fifty dollars or more and I
fix it by using offer code tectus so
that's effectively ten bucks off a pro
Tech tool kit because it costs just over
fifty dollars so definitely check that
out over at ifixit.com and use offer
code tectus to save ten bucks you will
be happy that you did it one time
purchase to get one of these toolkits
and it costs less than having someone do
the job for you most of the time oh so
he didn't expect this place then oh that
inspector I we are not passing that
inspection anytime soon okay
