today we have from the all-new Logitech
G series which is different from the old
Logitech G series because all of the
part numbers except for this one have an
S at the end but the other ones do the
mice and the keyboard do I guess that
sort of fell flat ah the G 230 so this
is their new headset from the new G
series which is a little bit different
from the rest of the G series so the
selling point for the mice and keyboards
is their new sort of scientifically
engineered coding that they're using to
reduce the like guard will increase the
sweat resistance of the products and
make them less susceptible to sort of
general greasy gross Ness whereas this
one looks like more of an evolutionary
change for their headset line they've
definitely changed the overall look of
it and they've tried to make it a little
bit more I guess travel and land
friendly it's a lightweight headset and
instead of having things like one of
those things that I either love or hate
depending on the implementation it's
like the pleather ear cups that you
often find on headsets these ones have a
mesh a mesh implementation so what mesh
does is it allows it to breathe more in
terms of air so if you're sitting
somewhere for a long time and you want
to make sure that you're not getting
like you know sweaty all on the side of
your head and stuff then that is helpful
but what it does do is it makes a little
bit more open so you're able to hear the
the noises around you a little bit
better so check this out so they've got
very very very deep cushions here and
this is something that I wish more
companies would do see the shape here
it's actually shaped like an ear how
many times have you seen a pair of
headphones that are supposedly intended
to go around your ear that are round and
so small that they either interfere with
the top of your ear or crush your
earrings against your head if you wear
earrings you know for the girl gamers
out there or the guys with earrings it's
not not manly to wear earrings so going
for a lightweight design they've
definitely achieved that the microphone
is adjustable so you can go ahead and
see that I can put it up here I can put
it down here I can put it here I can put
it here we have people walking past
which is obviously hilarious right now
let's go ahead and see what Logitech has
to say for themselves on the outside of
the box there we go
performance sport cloth ear cups are
removable for cleaning oh I didn't even
notice that check this out
also they fold completely flat which is
convenient for packing them into a bag
and whoa there goes everything look back
and above it stop at there we go
okay yeah we're back so that was that
was fun
so they fold flat which is nice if
you're gonna pack them in a bag or
something like that I wish they'd fold
it up a little bit more because what you
can see here is that the constructions I
mean the construction feels very solid
the band's here are metal which is nice
I don't really like to see these made of
plastic because I just don't really
trust it in the longer term they've got
nice little rubber o-rings in between
here so they've got a nicer feel when
you're twisting them then the ones that
don't have that are they'll they'll feel
very plastic II without that whereas
these feel very smooth but when I'm
packing them flat I would worry a little
bit about the fact that this doesn't
fold flat so it's a minor quibble I mean
always be careful with your electronics
anyway but there you go
I do like the width of the headband
itself up here but what I noticed was
that the padding is actually not that
much wider so in practice when you put
this thing on it doesn't really feel
like it's that wide however it's not
that much of an issue because they are
extremely light and it's difficult to
find that balance between light and
cheap feeling but I think Logitech
struck it again with nice little touches
like the o-rings here that make it feel
a little bit a little bit more solid now
in terms of aesthetics logitech has
always been good at this on their g
series they've got nice little chromed
G's on the side as well as red trim
around the outside of the headset this
is kind of a red pleather and then these
are the removable removable ear cushions
that they were talking about so all you
have to do there's no cheap plastic
clips I've seen that a number of times
where the where the optional ear cups
are attached with these little plastic
clips that just break and then the
pieces come off inside the headset and
then they're in there forever and they
rattle around unless you open it up so
these are super easy to to remove and
put back on presumably you just wash
them with some detergent and
sort of just scrub them out and get them
all cleaned up leave them somewhere to
dry so that would be recommended the
microphone is noise cancelling I don't
think I mentioned that before so that's
why there's a port on the one side as
well as the other side and the cord is a
red braided cable that's actually quite
striking and nice-looking in terms of
the length let's go ahead and have a
look at how long it is because they've
got inline volume control which I
personally really like I mean I don't I
don't think I like it as much as on
their more premium headsets where it's
built into the side of the headset but I
think it's a necessity for any kind of a
gaming product so there's a volume knob
here and then a microphone mute button
right here so there's your mute there's
your not mute and then it clips on to
whatever you pretty much want it to clip
on to life looks like it can very
comfortably reach around to the back of
your computer aha reach around so it's a
boat here we go
one Linus arm span about two full Linus
arm spans let's put a 10-foot cable and
at the end you've got your typical
headphone microphone jacks and then
you've got a little built-in velcro
piece here that you can use for cable
management let's go ahead and see if
there's anything else that I've missed
that's probably slick calling again to
tell me the power's out now this is kind
of a cryptic thing for Logitech to call
out it's got a three year warranty but
check this out what you need Windows 8
Windows 7 Mac or Linux operating system
headset and microphone inputs really
that's just sort of bizarre because
because it just uses standard
three-and-a-half millimeter jacks it'll
fit in pretty much anything so there you
go impedance is 32 ohms if that matters
to you and the drivers are 40 millimeter
Neil Diamond drivers so I think that
pretty much wraps it up
so I'll just I'll just wrap up with a
little bit of you know strutting showing
you guys what it looks like when it's
installed on the the users head there's
that microphone flexibility so you can
put it you know if you have a
particularly large head then you can put
it like down here
oh I never showed sizing so maximum size
look at that actually that's pretty good
so maximum size is going to look like
this on me which is obviously kind of
ridiculous and then minimum size is
probably more suitable for like small
children there
for adult gamers so I have a mediums I
wear a medium-sized motorcycle helmet so
that should give you some idea and I end
up pulling it around halfway down before
they actually get comfortable so thank
you for checking out this unboxing and
first look at the G 230 from Logitech
