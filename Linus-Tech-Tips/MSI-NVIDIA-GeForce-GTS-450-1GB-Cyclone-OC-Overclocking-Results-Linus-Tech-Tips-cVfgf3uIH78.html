guide well not really guide just an
overclocking result video for the
GeForce GT s 450 cyclone from MSI so I
have dialed in my final overclock on the
GPU so I've got nine hundred forty two
megahertz on the core 2.2 two gigahertz
on the RAM and the shader with all Fermi
architectures is locked to the core at
this time I have maxed out the voltage
but you can see my temperatures are
still well within reason at about 60
degrees with 64 percent fan speed which
isn't too loud really considering that
the GPUs under full load so I'm just
going to do some performance benchmarks
and then at the end of this video you'll
see what GPU artifacting looks like in a
very extreme example of me pushing it a
little bit too far here's my default
score with the GTS 450 cyclone from MSI
now bear in mind this is going to be a
little bit higher than what we'd get
with a stock clocked GTS 450 because the
cyclone OC which I didn't mention before
it is an OC card is stock overclocked so
there you go there's our baseline and
I'll be back with the overclocked
performance in a moment so you can see
here with my overclocking profile which
I actually did have to adjust slightly
since I did that last shot the RAM was
not it was stable in fir mark but it was
not quite stable in 3dmark Vantage I was
getting some artifacts so my final
overclock ended up being 942 mega Hertz
on the core 2.2 gigahertz on the ram so
you can see with that overclock we've
managed to get a pretty sizable increase
in our vantagescore and I guess that
pretty much concludes my overclocking
results for the msi geforce GT s 450
cyclone well this is probably the
funkiest example of artifacting i've
ever seen
I'm working on my overclocking guide I
guess I'll just throw this video at the
end of the overclocking guide but I
turned up the memory clock to 2.3
gigahertz and even turning it back down
didn't fix it but I just wanted to show
you guys this is a fairly extreme
example of what
artifacting can look like you can
vaguely see the ring from fur mark
spinning sometimes in the background but
other than that the screen is basically
gibberish now odds are excellent I
haven't damaged the card you can see I
set it back to what I know is a safe
setting so I'd still doubt the core
Frank tup and I still got the memory
clock at two point two five gigahertz
actually it was stable a little higher
than that so we can try one more setting
anyway this is just part of the process
and sometimes you get some pretty
spectacular fireworks displays when
you're overclocking a graphics card</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
