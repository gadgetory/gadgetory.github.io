Xbox 1x we were intrigued to say the
least there's 40 compute units it has
native support for 4k 60fps gameplay are
there asterisks next to these claims are
gonna leave us disappointed or are we
finally looking at a console that
achieves both affordability and a PC
like gameplay experience speaking of not
being disappointed today's video is

so even though it's being touted as the
most powerful console ever Microsoft's
latest keeps the familiar Xbox one
branding rather than adopting a new name
that would immediately indicate an
all-new experience but this makes sense
on some level although the Xbox one X is
graphically more capable than last
year's Xbox one s the changes to its
internal architecture are evolutionary
rather than revolutionary you'll be
plugging in the same ports and playing
the same games on the same controller
just with prettier pixels so if you
think about it buying a console has
become more like a PC than ever before
there are now two models of the
PlayStation 4 and three of the Xbox one
whose primary difference is our form
factor power efficiency and graphics
card configuration just like the gaming
computer shelf at a Best Buy or
something like that that is not to say
though that the specification
differences between the Xbox one X and
its predecessors aren't significant on a
sheet of paper to some people they're
just higher numbers the higher clock
Jaguar CPU is literally just that but
looking closely at the graphics
configuration of this new custom chip
reveals that it's closest desktop PC
equivalent is probably a Radeon rx 580
which is a very capable card so in
practical terms they make possible the
big selling point for the console its
support for 4k gaming at 60fps natively
understandably Microsoft hasn't been shy
about this hardware investment marketing
the Xbox one X as a premium experience
now of course that doesn't mean you can
expect to find a water cooling system
and an SSD in it but it is equipped with
a beefier vapor chamber heatsink than we
saw in the Xbox one s that kept the
hottest part of the system at a
reasonable 70 degrees under load without
getting obnoxiously loud and there's a
one terabyte hard drive that is
advertised as up to 50 percent faster a
benefit not just to game load times but
also when the system needs to stream in
higher resolution textures as you
wander around open environments
feature-wise the 1x is state-of-the-art
it comes with out-of-the-box support for
both HDR 10 high dynamic range redundant
I know you can learn more about it up
here but basically it amounts to deeper
blacks brighter whites and more vibrant
colors on supported displays along with
that there's also Dolby Atmos a surround
sound technology that encodes audio as
objects instead of individual channels
for greater positional accuracy and
realism with the proper home theater
hardware Atmos is a game changer BB
Atmos headphone is also supported with a
$15.00 add-on purchase but the gears for
dolby headphone experience and even some
canned demos they were pretty
underwhelming so I would hold off on
this one at least for now now let's look
at the visual experience we gathered our
competitors and settled on a test suite
of games that showed off the Xbox one X
is different ways of rendering 4k
content let's kick things off with four
to seven this was one of the titles
Microsoft demoed prior to the One X's
launch to show off its native 4k 60
capabilities unsurprisingly the Xbox one
X absolutely shined in this game not
only did it give us much better detail
than the upscaled 4k from the 1s it was
even a little bit better than our $500
PC which was running the game at 4k on
the recommended preset at around 45 FPS
anti-aliasing helped our PC a little bit
but the Xbox one X showed off details we
couldn't quite make out on the PC even
the controls on the dashboard inside our
car and it did so while running the game
noticeably more smooth so yeah score one
for the One X here though of course this
is a Microsoft exclusive game so the ps4
Pro didn't actually get a crack at it
let's move right along to shadow of war
another native 4k title but one that
only runs at 30fps on the One X this
game looked more or less equally nice on
the ps4 Pro and the Xbox one Xbox Turk
wallet' II and the 1s again was
noticeably less sharp due to the lack of
native 4
okay support the system that gave us the
worst overall experience at 4k was our
will our $500 PC which had to turn down
to the lowest preset to be playable but
obviously we are aware that that could
be due to video memory limitation and
should be noted that at 1080p and ultra
details it kept pace much better now
let's look at Assassin's Creed origins
which uses checkerboard rendering at 4k
on both of our flagship consoles this
ended up being a very similar story to
shadow of war with the ps4 pro and Xbox
one X looking nearly identical the one
asks a little bit less sharp and the
$500 PC was only playable on the low
preset until we turn down the resolution
but you should note that on PC there's a
lot of performance issues due to some
funky DRM stuff that's going on a weird
aside here is that although Ubisoft
called Assassin's Creed on the Xbox one
X the definitive version of the game we
were very hard-pressed to notice
anything that made it stand out but
Microsoft says it isn't all about 4k and
they claimed that the more powerful
processor in the Xbox one X will like
we've been doing on our PC during our
testing allow the use of higher quality
assets at 1080p so we turned down the
resolution of both our One X and our PC
to 1080p then cranked our PC presets up
to ultra quality on each game and to the
Xbox's credit all three games looked
nearly identical with the small caveat
that we needed to enable the favored
quality setting on shadow of war this
customizability is a fantastic trend
that we support and we'd like to see
continue but if you're going to be
gaming on a 1080p display for the
foreseeable future
this doesn't necessarily give the most
powerful console ever an unequivocal
recommendation that's because for us if
we're going to have a similar gaming
experience anyways we'd rather go for a
more versatile PC that isn't restricted
to one specific console ecosystem with
that said the 4k experience is a bit of
a different story if you have to build a
PC from the ground up for $500
especially if you're including windows
that price the Xbox 1x craps all over
the 4k gaming experience you'd be having
if you want to buy brand-new hardware
from a store with a warranty and all of
that and not do the whole scrapyard
worst thing at this point in time but if
you're comparing to a ps4 Pro which is a
hundred bucks cheaper and has the same
support for technologies like HDR and
Dolby Atmos bitstream pass-through along
with very similar gaming performance in
a fair amount of titles while that
hundred dollar premium gets you the
awesome UHD 4k blu-ray playback if
you're going to use that and most
importantly for the majority of people
more powerful hardware that should
deliver a higher percentage of games at
krispy 4k sixty there's also the awesome
benefit of Xbox play anywhere which
allows you to play your games on both
Xbox and PC with just one purchase which
is great for both being able to play
with your friends despite being on
potentially a different platform and as
an awesome value add you do have to
wrestle with the always infuriating
Windows Store on the PC side but I'll
take it if it means that I get my game
on both platforms without paying twice
super cool another thing to consider is
that if you've already got a PC with a
4k display and 500 bucks burning a hole
in your pocket
it might be worth upgrading that will
likely net you the best 4k gaming
experience for your money but the Xbox
one X absolutely has a place in the
market if you have or will soon obtain a
4k TV HD are for an added bonus and if
you want a console to take full
advantage of it the Xbox one X will
deliver the best frame rates and the
highest resolution for consoles and
before you scream about it know it's not
a replacement for GT X 1080 it's not a
replacement for a Vegas 64 these things
can run 4k at i popping frame rates
that's wonderful but it might be enough
to stem the tide of exponent peasant
station jokes at least for a while maybe
in some corners isn't it I Who am I
kidding it's not going to do anything
I'm sure there's already a massive war
