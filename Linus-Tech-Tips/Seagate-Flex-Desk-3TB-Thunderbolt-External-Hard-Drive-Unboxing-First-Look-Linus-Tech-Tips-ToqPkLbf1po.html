drive solution from seagate this is the
goflex desk for mac and while i normally
don't really focus on mac products too
much on this channel don't hit the
dislike button yet guys because this
product is not only for mac the thing
that makes it for mac is the fact that
it is vulnerable ready but thunderbolt
has arrived on the pc here's a high in
these suits motherboard BAM thunderbolt
so we are actually going to be trying
this out on a pc so we'll find out just
how Mac optimized that happens to be but
in the meantime yes okay mostly
Thunderbolt has been deployed on the Mac
up to 20 times faster than USB 2 up to 2
times faster than USB 3 it is compatible
with Apple time machine good for it it
can also care own check this out it
includes a thunderbolt cable this is no
small matter because thunderbolt cables
are not cheap they are not the same as
DisplayPort cables even though the pin
out and the physical connector looks the
same on first glance they are different
because a thunderbolt cable actually has
active processing actual chips in either
end of the cable it is an active cable
that makes it able to carry such an
immense amount of data over that kind of
a distance in an external connector okay
durable soft touch finish
high-performance desktop hard drive
compatible with Thunderbolt displays and
other devices okay 10 gigabit per second
interface 12 times fast and firewire 800
dual ports allowing daisy chaining up to
six devices minimizing clutter on your
desktop and inside the box you got a
bunch stuff which we are obviously going
to find because we are going to open the
box let's look at the accessories first
in here we find a power connector okay
we also find a haha this is my trivial
no laughing matter included Thunderbolt
cable so one of the easiest ways to tell
the difference between a thunderbolt
cable and a displayport cable is the
Thunderbolt logo on it okay so yes
displayport cables will have a DP logo
thunderbolt ready cables
we'll have a thunderbolt logo also for
the time being most Thunderbolt cables
have a much longer connector than most
DisplayPort cables let me actually go
find one all right so these are some of
the different ways the cables can be
recognized so the two on the outsides
are Thunderbolt the one with the DP on
it this one right here is display port
and the one with no label but the
shorter connector is also display port
so thunderbolt cables can carry
DisplayPort signals but DisplayPort
cables cannot carry thunderbolt signals
because they don't have the active
processing tips inside the cables okay
so here's our Thunderbolt cable ah ok
moving on next we have the goflex desk
Thunderbolt adapter this is a quick
start guide so let's have a look and see
how you quick start okay you get all the
stuff and then you plug the thing in to
the thing into the other thing so the
wall into the thing into the other thing
okay you use only with a seagate
provided limited power supply okay got
it done number two you plug the
Thunderbolt thing into the other
Thunderbolt thing with the Thunderbolt
cable BAM that's how quick it is holy
smokes ok let's open up the actual drive
itself ooh this actually feels very nice
yeah they do they have that soft touch
finish on it seems pretty durable at
first quorums that's kind of nice got
ventilation in the back so you can see
right there so oh oh yeah ok ok ok ok ok
Kagan so this looks solid from here and
then this is open so it's like business
in the front party in the back yeah I
went there ok so here I want to clarify
something a little bit so here's we've
got a seagate three and a half inch
external drive ok this goflex desk for
Mac is actually a combination of two
products sort of so the three and a half
inch drive is from there ok so this is
their backup plus drive so you can buy
another backup plus drive and then you
can actually mount it see it's just a
SATA connection down there so you just
mount it to the Thunderbolt docking
station right here so you got a couple
little foam bits here so you don't
scratch up your drive when you're
putting it in and out I've also got
this is going to get really shiny if I
take that off so slick will thank me for
leading it on but you've got like a
plastic cover for protecting this
surface as well okay you've got 43 posts
here as well as the state of connectors
you've got what looks like ventilation
holes on the bottom for rubber pieces
here to keep it from slipping around and
power and two Thunderbolt connections as
well as a seagate logo so you can
actually use this as a quick and
convenient way to instead of just using
like external drives like you know just
lying around you just buy these with
their modular it's sort of go flex yeah
I don't know if they call yeah they
still call goflex ok so the goflex
interface I don't know if you know if
you guys know this but we use goflex
drives for our test bench because that
allows us to quickly switch between usb3
esata or whatever is the most convenient
interface just with their go flex cable
connectors so this this is like a go
flag c-type interface clip into the
Thunderbolt base or there are ones that
as you can see here don't come with a
thunderbolt base they come with a
different base and then you just leave
the base plugged in you get a bunch of
these and you can just kind of go ok you
put it on hopefully can get it to come
off something pretty good okay so you
just you know you put like a label on it
like blah blah blah video archive June
whatever to may winner at may goes for
14 so so jun 2012 to may 2013 um you put
that away you keep it on a shelf you get
another one you throw it on to your your
Thunderbolt docking port here your
whatever they want to call it goflex
desk Thunderbolt guy and then you go
ahead and start filling up a new one so
the advantage of vulnerable is that
compared to interfaces like USB which
aren't really designed for intensive I
oh they're fast but they're mostly fast
with pure sequential reads and writes if
you want to actually use it as a scratch
disk or use it to run applications off
of say for example if you have a
notebook that doesn't have a ton of
internal storage because it uses an SSD
and you want to be able to plug into
your desk and have mass storage that is
going to be truly fast even when you're
accessing small files
even when you're running programs
directly off of it something like this
is going to be the way to go even
compared to solutions like USB three so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at the seagate goflex
desk for mac and pc because pcs have
Thunderbolt now don't forget to
