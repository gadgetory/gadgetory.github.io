tips livestream today we had some bad
luck and we end our 20 minutes late you
know what I think this is actually the
latest we've been if you don't factor in
no you can't do it in there you have to
do it in the other tab if you don't
factor in the times where we've started
on time but then we've been just
destroyed by by technical difficulties
and we've had to come back so it's that
top one you have to edit it and copy
paste in all the stuff otherwise it
won't work yeah sometimes it's finicky
it's like YouTube right it's just yeah
oh speaking of YouTube we're gonna be
talking about YouTube's paid
subscriptions a little bit later on in
the livestream and what all of this
means what what we think of it as as
content creators who predominantly work
through YouTube but we're gonna start
with summer drivers come on I mean it's
one thing when it's like that first
major like rainstorm and the roads are
slick and people are like oh I forgot
how to drive in the rain and it's like
you know what I understand when it's the
first major snowfall of the year and
some people don't have their snow tires
on yet you get caught by surprise but
people who get in accidents in the
summer what are you doing and like the
first one we ran into today
Oh is a minor like you could see some
scratches that's it the bolts holding on
the license plate in the front left an
indent in the rear bumper of the car
that was hit that's like that was the
damage this chick was stopped in the
left lane of a two-lane highway okay
with huge shoulders huge shoulders on
both sides
she's just stopped right there it's like
does your car work do your legs work get
off the road
move I mean we're not talking people who
are in major accidents and you know you
need to have like investigation of what
happened and and all that other stuff
that goes on we're not talking about
that we're talking about are you in a
minor fender-bender
where like you're fine get out of the
way anyway so that delayed us by what
like four
minutes this morning half an hour 40
minutes are down there so ng our interns
like waiting for us at NCI acts for
about 40 minutes this morning because we
had no idea because we don't know how
Google Maps works with traffic
apparently anything to check it and then
on the way back today I mean this one
was legitimately a pretty legitimate
accident well we probably lost what a
good half hour 40 minutes on the way
back east so I mean it's one of those
things where for all of you commuters
out there who actually commute Monday to
Friday every week I mean this is
probably sort of I sound like I'm
complaining pretty hard for how bad my
situation is I commute once a week but
today was today was an ugly commute
beautiful weather I wish I'd been on the
bike because then hey I could have are
you trying to change that I can't think
just change it back to the old one and
change it I can't figure out oh it is on
the old one oh it's probably not logged
in I don't think there's anything we can
do better right now um but yeah I only
commute once a week so for all my right
I wish I was on the bike today because
the weather was gorgeous and I could
have just kind of gone around things
relatively easily as well not that you
should do that although it's funny
because it's a very North American thing
for you know bikes on the shoulder bikes
in between lanes like all that stuff
stop it stop it pause it
it's a very okay just just kill it our
internet bandwidth this links do you
know I know it so it's a very North
American thing for that to be like woo
like over in Europe whites are all over
the place you see people like on their
scooters going down the sidewalk you see
them like you know parked on the
sidewalk basically there's no room to
walk I think it's just one of those
things where we have the luxury of all
this space here so we like create rules
that don't work unless you just have
like tons of space like I don't know I
hope we have to in space we do have tons
I don't necessarily want people parking
their bikes on the sidewalk why they
parked their bicycle on the side I'll
take up the entire your bike is a lot
bigger than your bicycle really yeah not
really yeah
takes up a lot more space in a bicycle
other thing too is I've noticed in
Europe it doesn't matter which way the
traffic was supposed to be moving on the
street cars are just parked pointing
like whichever which direction like
you'll just you'll be cruising along
this way and then you'll just like go
over to the other side to park perfectly
normal over there here you get a ticket
for sure yeah park using the wrong way
even if you're parked the wrong way
outside your house that I didn't know
about yep
we had a car parked the wrong direction
outside of our house because he just
like pulled out of the driveway and just
went the wrong direction cuz he just had
to move his car to the way because we
were it was my brother I think pretty
sure isn't I really and we were working
on stuff in the front of us so we're all
home and his car isn't going the wrong
way
take it take it Wow and in front of your
house pretty much in the boonies but
stuff like call the clip there's a
conversation right there so they were
just on their way somewhere probably
going somewhere fat because they don't
usually hang around Aria nothing ever
happens in our area right so they're
usually going somewhere oh that's a
shame they're pretty not so happy about
that I don't remember if it was my
brother who was but someone outside my
house when we were all there got a
ticket that's well I'm throwing my
keyboard don't worry about it wow it
managed to type vgy
in front of our news items vgy why so
it's like you're almost triplet tribes
yeah who gets that right
no one alright so thanks to all 1200 of
you who tuned in in spite of the fact
that we're late and we are very sorry
about that I'm done making excuses for
the first six minutes of the livestream
so let's move on to our first news item
of the week which is check this out so
our link is w CCF something whatever I
don't know what this website is called
they should really work on that and
apparently oh oh apparently after a
presenter right after it wait what look
at the end press ENTER BAM there we go
copy paste you have to install the
Google Drive app for whatever friggin
reason so apparently there's a retailer
in China who is selling Haswell chips so
you can see here's a big bull pile of
intel's new and improved
boxart honestly I don't know about this
box I don't like it
it's like um when I first remember when
I asked you if this was the legitimate
release yeah yeah reason why I asked
that was because I was like that box art
looks too cheesy for Intel like the top
looks like Intel yeah you know with the
futuristic looking microprocessor
looking I see looking thing here it's
these two bits which they can't see but
you could weave your most face yeah
that's a little bit but that still seems
like their style at least at least it
looks kind of science II a science in
robotic you know there's like a picture
I like the idea is it's like Oh what you
can create with Intel technology and
it's about like creation and creativity
and that kind of good stuff and back to
the news thing so Taobao has listed has
waltrip so you can see the full specs of
what's available so the only real
difference this is interesting
so the 4770 and 4770k have the same
maximum turbo frequency this time around
also apparently all these chips are
using HD 4600 graphics which is I
haven't which is good because last time
around a lot of the lower end chips
we're using the lower end onboard
graphics which to me is completely
backwards because low end customers are
going to be using onboard graphics not
guys who are buying like 4770k s
with that said the integrated graphics
can benefit performance customers if
you're using features like quick sync
which will allow you to transcode your
video using the or GPU so anyway you can
see all the specs for the chips there
you can also see pricing converted and
then there's some boards that are
available as well so there's a couple
biostar boards and msi board as well as
an Asus saber-tooth z87 board that is
apparently available now if you're
viewing this from China which I suspect
you're not at least you won't be
watching a YouTube archive from China I
discovered that there's apparently a lot
of videos and of me in China yeah we do
we talked about this could
did we talk about it on the livestream I
don't know so no so China's big video
sharing site I don't remember what it's
called but YouTube's blocked over there
so it's not YouTube but there's videos
and there's like a video of me unboxing
like in a soos ITX board that has like
26,000 views I'm like what really what's
going on who are you who are these
people watching my videos that I didn't
even know about it at all which is kind
of crazy it's pretty cool I mean piracy
and is cool I guess but but like at
least my contents like good enough to
pirate yeah so and if they're not gonna
be able to see it anyways yeah if
someone was doing it here and getting
twenty six thousand views I'd be like
okay that's kind of annoying
no it's pretty normal for Intel CPUs to
be leaked and available ahead of launch
but we're like three weeks plus away
from launch this is sort of early even
for like Intel chips to be and normally
you see them available in like Taiwan or
something
yeah you know where all those
manufacturers are anyway so you know
like a couple master cartons and
motherboards fall off a truck somewhere
or someone lost their job because they
leaked it and like like bad things
usually oh yeah
whereas this is just it seems like nope
it's just there apparently tiny Tom
Logan has his z87 boards we haven't got
ours yet but he's got some gigabyte ones
we're hoping for some from a Seuss
pretty shortly we've had chips for weeks
but no motherboards for them yet so
anyway has well is is very much upon us
by the look of things
so let's we're gonna move through a few
of our news items this week pretty
quickly I think because we've got a lot
of topics to cover but then we're gonna
do some Twitter Q&amp;amp;A a little bit
afterwards
so our next news item we're actually I
mean okay
Logan from tech syndicate is not the
first one to have reported on the
illumiroom prototype but we thought we'd
just give him a shout out because he's a
great guy we hung out a little bit at a
Seuss's event and this is some cool
technology this video has been out for a
little while now but check this
if you search for illumiroom there you
go that's how to spell it
illumiroom on YouTube it is a very cool
demo of the Xbox for the lack of knowing
what it's actually going to be called
xbox 720 next-gen Xbox with a TV okay so
the TV's here and then a projector setup
that aims around the TV so sort of
filling the room so it's meant to be an
augmented gaming experience so what I
mean what do you think is the coolest
thing it does and then I'll say the
coolest thing and then we'll go from
there
I like the explosion thing because okay
spreading the screen past your TV unless
you have like in the demo tell them that
he spreads the screen past the team okay
yeah sorry I I was focusing on what I'm
doing a year I didn't actually listen to
you the whole time sorry I guess that's
rude I actually have stuff I had to get
done anyways it can spread stuff across
the screen or it can allow like just
certain things to go out so they say
explosions or flares of any kind or big
streaks say if you're driving really
quickly you could have like brake lights
going past yep it can highlight items
yet stuff that you can pick up so so if
there if there's like if you kill some
dude and there's a pickup item and it
glows and you walk past that glow could
be on the other side screen blues
outside of the screen yeah like sitting
on your bookshelf yeah
because the projector is projecting this
so what I like the most is the
explosions and the item thing okay
because I most likely I'm gonna have
like shelving units or whatever on the
side of my TV so it's gonna be
inconsistent and I know from seeing the
demo that it's actually very good at
covering that up and making it still
look good but I would still not really
like having the entire environment like
the whole thing spread out past my TV
yeah for me it's a very it's a very
noticeable break yeah exactly we have a
TV which is like a super high quality
great image and then still good but my
monocycle not nearly as good washed it
and like on objects and stuff yeah with
that said the illumiroom uses a Kinect
type of sensor to compensate for objects
because it knows that they're there so
it still looks really good but not as
good as obviously you can only
compensate so much projector technology
is
I mean it's not like Steve Jobs came
back invented the projector and
delivered it all to us on like a cushion
that's made of stop okay
no anyway it's my favorite one it's
explosions and like glowy things because
it'll be cool to see the context yeah
without the distraction I guess exactly
and then it would still be cool if I
miss an item it's like oh okay
so my thing would be um things like
weather effects and debris that's what I
thought was the neatest thing about it
so you could be one of the demos they
showed and the demo is real it's not
composited or anything like that so one
of the demos I showed was like a racing
game where you could have like snow or
you could have weather effects that are
in the room that go beyond just looking
through that window that you could sort
of in your mind's eye you could pretend
is the cockpit not only that but if you
have like things like grenades or if you
had something like a piece of your car
goes flying the projector could let it
bounce off a bookshelf and land on the
floor with the same game physics that
are being used by the game itself
now with all someone says to stop Lynas
you are oh probably the Steve Jobs bit
right ah
so with all of that said what are the
odds you'd set this up assuming it was
free someone handed you an Xbox 720 a TV
and a projector is this what you would
do with them to be honest yeah yeah I
would like the explosion thing and I
would like the item thing okay stuff
like the snow would you put it it would
take up so much space me projectors
short throw projector will help yeah and
you don't have to always have it there
as well but I mean it's yet another
thing to turn on I mean if you got like
a university or something in the thing
don't they have another table I think
this is gonna be really nice
oh I'm sure like super nice I mean you
look at how cheap projectors are now you
can get a good quality 1080p projector
for less than a thousand bucks it's
still cool though because you're awesome
your one friend or your run friends dad
who cares enough is gonna have it set up
and when you go to their house it's
gonna be awesome
whether or not you set it up I think it
would be cool to set up I would at least
try okay
I mean I've thought things were gimmicky
that ended up being a thing before I
thought the DES was ridiculous really I
was like no no I mean when I heard about
it when I got one and I was like oh okay
like I got it I was like okay I do use
the other screen for some stuff with
that said I didn't look at it much yeah
but I liked that it was there I I I
thought it would be good just cuz of
Pokemon the only thing I play on mobile
devices anyways it's Pokemon I think
that's the only reason why I've ever
bought Game Boys is cuz of Pokemon I'll
end up playing like a few other games
but it's pretty much Pokemon of tetris
so yeah we'll see I don't see myself
setting this up even if even if someone
handed me the projector I'd probably
just like go have like a projector room
and like a TV room and it must be
different if I somehow could like if I
had either a roof mount or if I had a
table that was properly lined up I think
outside of it even then though it's
there okay so there's the wire mess
there's the sort of pain in the butt
with all the inputs and all that mess
I don't mind cable managing things so
you really really really really hate
putting holes in your wall oh I do but I
would very properly and nicely cable
manage it along the roof okay well why
don't we move on to our next topic so
guys if you're not already subscribed to
Tek syndicate raise the world with zero
instead of an O I you know I gave him
hack about the name of his YouTube
channel when when I met up with the most
liked to put what's up with that how are
people supposed to find your YouTube
channel okay so raise our eyes Eddy not
re ISE raise the world zero not o go
subscribe to Logan if you aren't already
and tell him his YouTube channel name is
dumb
alright yeah I know he does okay but
it's not because people remember the
name of his channel I don't think I
remember maybe that's part of it it
stands out too much it's ridiculous so
you're like whoa but it's hard to tell
someone about it true speaking of things
that are gonna be hard to communicate
this is the clearest companion a tablet
designed for seniors
so senior citizens I don't know if you
guys have any senior citizens in your
family I sure do and I remember my
grandpa signed up for one of those Telus
promotions where you got if you signed
up for a fixed contract of I think it
was three years you got a free Dell
computer well so that you could leverage
the internet that you just paid them in
advance sort of like you booked in
advance with them okay so this was back
when a computer anyone cared about so
this was the promo before they did the
free notebook which was before they did
the free we so this was a long time ago
like back when we was a thing right
Nintendo Howe in trouble anyway I
digress so the free computer thing I
remember sitting there trying to show
them how to use a mouse he'd get like
the edge of the table and be like what
do I do now like no like I kid you not
like that's what it's like do you
remember the guy who works at NCIX who
did a lot of the the IT admin he used to
teach a class back in the 80s on using
the computer and the mouse was very
simple like everyone was like that back
then apparently like he put together the
most ridiculous possible curriculum he
taught it at UBC Wow yeah and people
came in and paid good money to take this
course on like not having the mouse like
fall off the desk as you got to the edge
like kid you not anyway so my grandpa
was like that I can't even imagine after
that experience trying to put a tablet
in front of him so the clearest
companion attempts and I'm not gonna say
they've achieved it because I haven't
had my hands on one but attempts to make
it friendly for seniors so it uses a
bamboo wooden design that's designed get
this guy's to look kind of like an
old-school CRT TV set
just like a wooden frame yeah and the
speakers at the front see the speakers
at the bottom on the front right there
amplified speakers with huge ginormous
fonts optimized for senior citizens it
only has it doesn't even say what OS it
runs like I actually don't know what OS
it is probably an insanely modified
version of Android like unrecognizable
super cut-down unrecognizable there's
like five buttons on the front and there
are things like pill schedule like
all daughter like like that's pretty
much all it does it's expected to have a
cellular data connection and they have a
subscription service that depending how
much you pay for the Claire's companion
upfront the subscription is cheaper the
more you pay for it up front there's
even a lifetime option which is a
thousand dollars and I did the math and
apparently the company is expecting the
old people to live for like another year
or two based on the lifetime
subscription I was like oh that's kind
of a sad thought because you'd never
offer a lifetime subscription for a
cellular service to someone in their 20s
for a thousand bucks I should buy one
just to see how long they honor my
lifetime subscription guys if you want
me to do a Kickstarter I spend $1000 on
a klaris companion to get a lifetime
subscription
we're like actually not doing that you
would never ever use it and you probably
can't transfer utility service so like
here's this crap crap tablet that you
can use for your life yeah so it has
easy-grip sides and I think we're pretty
much done talking about it built-in
charger for connector for eliminating
fussy cables amplified speakers and huge
fonts and so anyway yeah I thought that
was sort of interesting babe they
actually reached out to me that's where
I got this news item from they were like
dude do you want to talk about this
tablet I'm like yeah sure I guess also
wanted color if I didn't mean crap isn't
like it's a bad tablet I mean it doesn't
know like the OSB we don't know do us
being locked down in 40 years it's not
gonna be the fastest thing that's what I
meant by cop but it'll be made of wood
bamboo and it will therefore be real
working problem like wood won't exist
anymore
yeah that's truly it could be a
collector site I bet it is a collector's
item by that time by that point the
first Bamboo tablet we're not talking
Wacom Bamboo tablet we're talking a
bamboo tablet here folks now let me tell
you this is the best gosh darn Bamboo
tablet that I ever done seen you should
go ahead and for only $1,000 you get a
lifetime subscription it's like that i
totally picture this on QVC
let me tell you old folks this right
here let you keep in touch with your
done gosh-darn their grandkids alike
they should advertise on QVC seriously I
think they would actually sell a fair
number because it's not a bad idea no
it's not not at all it's just I'm not
the target market no I'm not either but
it is not about it I poke fun at it a
little bit my grandpa's not the target
audience either he tries to be tech
savvy but I know quite a few older
people that would just don't want to
have anything to do with it if they can
just press a few buttons they're good no
it's funny because my mom thinks she's
tech-savvy but if I handed her that she
probably couldn't figure it out my mom
yeah my mom doesn't watch the live
stream though so your mom watches which
is I know why you're saying she did know
she could figure that it lets mom
watches the live stream just I think
absolutely awesome okay why don't we do
a little bit of Twitter Q he's kidding
oh I wish I had a picture of it my mom's
getting a superboss mechanical keyboard
so both will unbox it for sure yeah okay
just tuned in is that your new office no
we're moving to the new place in about
three weeks we were filming a video and
kind of took over the other area yeah we
were filming the build guide for the
Intel sponsored build guide that we have
upcoming so the entire garage has been
torn apart our height adjustable table
is where our normal table is this table
is in our fastest possible set and our
microphone is here so yet like you guys
here this is actually this white wall
back here is the set for a fast as
possible on tech cookie yeah so there
you go
are you yeah OAP are not ready for
tablets at least they can hit what they
see though my grandparents just got
broadband she is not ready for this fair
enough James hello to South Africa I
tried out a few mechanical keyboards at
Micro Center blues are my favorite
switches top blue switch keyboards
honestly any blue switch keyboard is
hard to go wrong pretty much if they're
making a blue switch keyboard they
probably have pretty good build
qualities at this point in time fair bit
of chat in the forum there was uh there
was what's your favorite switch thread
lot of people are validating Corsair
stance that Reds are for gaming yeah
saying that they get they get hand
fatigue finger fatigue from gaming on
blues or Browns
anything with tactile feedback weed I've
never gamed for that long so I have I
want greens which are heavier
okay well my hands are gonna get
fatigued it's just not gonna happen from
pressing pressing key switch down I know
maybe that's a thing it's just not a
thing with me can't really comment on
future products guys I muted the Big
Bang Theory to watch you that's good
because Big Bang Theory has a laugh
track and maybe we should add one I
tried to get off-screen for them I don't
think we did good thanks well we should
have a laugh track to our just like just
whenever things are not funny yeah we'll
be like EI and they'll be like that one
chick in the last track that's like we
should record our own terrible laugh
track just get a whole bunch people we
know and record our own you know it's
funny because like half the time we're
having conversations off-camera about
how to make the livestream like more
professional and like more like an
actual show and then when we actually
like get down to it what we're thinking
of doing record here olestra it's all
like the worst possible ideas you could
possibly have for a show we could make a
show called all the things that shows
shouldn't be and then yeah
be alright we must be this one yeah
you're late your time changes all the
time you set changes all the time topics
are not usually ready hey we have topics
like pretty darn ready for we did good
this week well it helps that I was
preparing them in the car for like an
hour and a half as we drove back you can
see I accent building a new Intel PC
soon is unreleased product a better than
unreleased product B or didn't come on
am I supposed to say we don't know yet
my friend wants to get a new graphics
card to play the latest games at 1920 by
1080 for example battlefield 3 what GPU
budget is four hundred and sixty dollars
first of all what kind of a budget is
four hundred and sixty dollars that's
oddly specific for how high it is yeah
it's like it's one thing if people are
like I have 75 dollars to spend
you kind of go okay four hundred and
sixty could he spare another twenty
three cents anyway at that price point
buy yourself a seventy eight fifty or
honestly like isn't 70 or seventy eight
fifty sorry seventy no it's kind of
confusing
is 7950 just the card to buy it's
crushing
I don't like every game test we do
7950 just wins and you know it's funny
because the comments on the latest one
who are you guys are always testing AMD
gaming evolved titles not testing any
Nvidia titles it's like AMD's giving
away like eight games with the 7990
games when they're giving away with
cards a lot of the time yes and NVIDIA
is giving away one game right now we
will test Metro last light and we will
task last light definitely we will but
it's like we can't do anything about the
fact that every hot title right now is a
gaming of all title and it's funny
because the same thing happened not that
long ago when every title was a way it's
meant to be played titled Lotus you
don't just need gaming of all time
releasing one yeah anyway we will test
many lastly don't worked up today you
are stressed out but in in that bracket
they have 660ti and our 660ti was like
the original beast power edition one yes
so you would think that that card should
be able to run with it but do you like
be like golden sample of that category
but it's the 7950 just and like 79 78 79
70 doesn't really perform that much
better especially when you overclock
them both which you should that yeah
that jump right there isn't interesting
so speaking of your friend wanting to
play battlefield 3 um he can't very
likely you can't right now maybe if he
wants to enjoy the single-player
campaign which is single-player even
working you have to go through battle
log to launch campaign okay so tell them
what's going on cuz they don't know I
haven't read this entire article but
from what I heard it's not in here yeah
just talking about it I'm just gonna go
off throw of my head then what I think
is happening because I read a little bit
is that I don't know if it's just EA as
a whole or it's like battle law origins
section or if it's just battlefield 3
section I don't know how this is exactly
is be going down but a lot of people I
don't know if it's everyone I'm pretty
sure it's just a lot of people can't
actually connect to battlefield 3 so
connection to EA servers blah blah error
1 so
Jays response is that there's been it
sounds like there's been some kind of a
targeted attack on their servers that's
been holding them down for what about a
week now oh really
people are not happy you know and so
what my theory is that all the guys who
were attacking our forum are attacking
yeah now it's my theory it's about a
week since we've had like serious
downtime speaking of the forum guys if
you are not members of the Linus tech
tips com forum go sign up right now
raise it
everyone go right yeah everyone go right
now and sign up and we're gonna see how
she handles it you know even if you are
already signed up go and just like hang
out yeah let's have a let's have a bro
session on the forums bro session on the
forum everyone go hang hang out go to
general post about what's going on yeah
let's just see what happens cuz we're
we're kind of curious we have made some
serious upgrades to the infrastructure
that's going on so to put this in
context since January we have gone from
hosting the forum on a weaksauce
computer at my house like under my desk
yeah to hosting on a beast computer with
six cores of CPU and forty eight gigs of
RAM at NCIX to outgrowing that to
hosting it at a data center to
outgrowing that to changing our software
and everything just generally getting
better and and still hosting it at a
data center with lengua a bajillion cpu
cores and all the good things that are
going on so things are seriously going
well for the forum so many people are
joining it's honestly like would you say
anecdotally in terms of typing a
question and expecting to get an answer
in a timely manner it's the best form
you've ever been on probably for me
because I've had problems in the past or
if I have a difficult enough question I
don't even bother ask because I'm like
by the time I get a proper answer this I
probably will it figured it out yep or
if you have a super simple question that
you're afraid to ask you get flamed and
flame everything's been just destroyed
and I don't see any
that on this forum not flaming we've had
a few random threads well I've seen the
answered not be almost immediate right
yeah few not that many but a few but
guys if you have a tech question I have
a lot of people still sending me like
private messages on YouTube or Facebook
messages guys I can't I get hundreds of
messages a day it's too much for me and
I'm a very small fraction of how much he
gets I mean it's one of those things
where it's like I love you guys and I
want to answer every question and I read
them all because it gives me ideas for
making videos but it's one of those
things where either I can be asked
Jeeves like ask Linus calm you type in
an answer and I just sit chained to a
computer desk and reply to all the
questions or I can be Linus tech tips
the guy who actually makes videos and
you can watch videos about the things
that are going to do with the tech
industry so yea though those are those
are pretty much the two options um yeah
so let's have a look hasn't Sloan down
at all we have one thousand sixty five
users on right now five hundred and
thirteen members five hundred and forty
four guests you got y'all got nothing so
anyway you tried you tried so guys do
hang out on the forum we're we're
thinking of issuing a challenge we
should do a video about it it's it's
coming soon coming soon okay okay but
soon there'll be and so if you guys are
early to this then you'll be that much
awesomer but we're gonna be issuing the
make Linus tech tips forum your homepage
challenge we have we have a few
interesting changes that we want to do
to it that'll make it easier to have it
at your homepage yeah which and so yeah
so the places that are most active guys
general discussion news is super active
honestly I started getting most of my
news from - tech tips forums
pretty cool it's kind of awesome great
community contributions and news guys so
like if you're there you're you're
actually you maybe not up to the minute
but you're kind of up to the hour and
you don't have to deal with the terrible
site design on reddit com
I'm on a roll here taking shots at EA -
I bet read it just like destroys me now
yeah I don't think Britta's
- what it's efficient the community
there is awesome you have a site design
not as awesome issues okay why don't we
agree that the community is awesome and
the site design is at least this far
away from the community is awesome this
level it's very efficient the reason why
dig fell behind is because they've
changed too many things and it was no
longer efficient okay I agree that it's
hard to change something about a hyper
popular site what would you change about
Reddit it's so efficient the whole thing
is about the front page and it's very
very very efficient everything is laid
out very nicely and cleanly ok but what
about finding stuff that isn't on the
front page the search function actually
works really well and if you go to a
subform again very clean okay I couldn't
figure out what any of the sub reddits
were there's like a bajillion sub
reddits that have seemingly zero
documentation that's not good site
design look on the right yeah there's
some stuff there but there's a how many
aren't there well that's not site design
that's the person who created the
subreddit putting in less information
okay well why don't we just agree to
disagree on this one all right I don't
think the site design is actually that
bad it's not interesting it's not that
pretty but it's very efficient and it's
very good at doing what it tries to do
which is be efficient speaking of Reddit
found a fantastic post on reddit about
the u.s. banning the blueprints for a 3d
printable gun yeah if someone wants that
to be online that will be online like
dumb bro that's what he's trying to do
oh I have no idea what this person is
doing anyways yeah it's one one site to
be online that'll be online it'll be
some way okay the entire the entire
reddit thread is just like people being
like I didn't even hear about this I
downloaded it because I can because they
told me not to like you know what that's
how the internet works I mean remember
the Anarchist Cookbook
yeah yes everywhere it's like it's like
one of those things where it's like how
hard was it to get a copy you ban it and
you make it more popular yes the only
reason why people okay
the only reason I heard about this
especially yes but my people hear about
certain things is because they get
banned I did not hear about the
Anarchist Cookbook until they banned it
and I was like oh that's kind of neat I
wonder if I can find oh there it is
right there and and on everyone's USB
thumbdrive at school at the time because
it was like because one of those things
were it's like I didn't go to school if
anyone who was gonna blow anything up no
it was just idle curiosity because they
banned it why was this band I want to
know that's in here that's not bad yeah
it's like and we're not promoting
anarchy and I'm not actually even saying
necessarily but I think 3d printed guns
are the greatest thing ever because I
don't all words saying is banning things
won't work internet dirt my god what was
I what was B role saying on the way on
the way back
that Beyonce's a PR I was trying to get
all like the unflattering images of her
off being removed from the internet like
okay hey Beyonce's not that attractive
like so many stars it's all about
getting the right angle with the right
makeup and the right lighting and Heche
it doesn't have a whole lot to do on the
right four days worth of Photoshop and
there yes exactly
there's a whole lot of that going on
don't kid yourself
and there's yeah it's like you can't
remove like pictures from the internet
so it's going as far as like pictures of
her while she's singing and on stage and
doesn't look good and trying to get them
removed like not gonna work do you
yeah someone needs to explain the
Internet to Beyonce as well beyond
Beyonce if you're watching that's not
how the internet works by the way you
have a lot of money we can sit here and
explain how the internet works yeah a
consultancy yeah right we'll take all
that money try and buy EA and turn it
into a successful time okay so to start
with the Internet is a series of tubes
never gets I know I love it
guys if you haven't seen it it's some US
Senator or something this the subtitle
for our networking forum is a series of
two is it really yeah that's
almost as good as the troubleshooting
for him I had someone specifically send
me a tweet saying how much they loved
the subtitle of ours of our
troubleshooting forum it's help I need
somebody help this do we have not just
anybody but not just anybody yeah okay I
added that so it was more easily
recognizable there we go okay so moving
on to our our first community news item
because pretty much all of the news
items are community news items this week
check this she is out so AMD has gone
full 360 here and I actually meant 360
you know how half the time people say
360 they actually mean 180 yeah yeah
I've done it yeah it's like I turned
around 360 degrees on that issue oh so
you have the same stance so yeah no not
actually that they've done a 360 here so
initially their next generation products
were going to be 8000 series they were
gonna be released in 2013 then they came
out and said no new GPUs in 2013 then
they went released 77 90 which is 2 is a
7000 series by name but not much more
than that it's a different architecture
it has been tweets somewhat so then
there was that and then there's the 7990
which isn't a new GPU I don't know
but is a new card so they release that
no new GPUs I believe they did say no
new GPUs okay so 790 doesn't technically
break it but then check this out so
there's a couple references this was
submitted by T bold I don't know how he
wants us to pronounce that or she not
sure um
so there's a couple of references here
but basically the 8000 series for
desktops might be skipped entirely and
that's not the first time this kind of
thing has happened
Nvidia didn't do a gtx 300 series yeah
confused that was weird
you know they they changed naming
schemes all the time AMD went from X 800
to X 1,800 if I recall correctly she's
like okay I guess so they skipped like
ten generations there so so apparently
they're thinking of skipping 8,000
series for desktop there's already 8000
series for notebooks but they are purely
rebrands okay and apparently the only
9000 series might be released in
December 2013 might it'll be
manufactured at 20 nanometer according
to the rumors this is all allegedly and
so there should be less power
consumption heat output more performance
per watt and it'll be paired with a new
architecture so what this could mean
allegedly is that we're getting not only
a die shrink but also an architecture
change at the same time big risk
potentially big reward they certainly
had a long time to work on it yeah
in fact internally they may have already
finished an 8000 series design which
might have been a die shrunk 7000 series
and then just decided not to bother
because maybe it didn't perform that
much better with the die shrink you saw
what happened with Intel and their
latest die shrink where they're not
actually getting a whole lot more clock
speed out of the chips they're saving on
power consumption but they're not
necessarily getting a ton more
performance we saw this with Sandy
Bridge to Ivy Bridge could have been
that did we respond okay let's just not
do this let's wait and you look it's
been almost two full graphics card
develops release cycles maybe we'll just
do 9,000 serious so maybe that's what's
happening this is all allegedly
supposedly according to rumor I know
nothing for sure about this if I did I
would not be talking about it just to
end up really quickly about that
battlefield 3 being offline thing that
was talking about earlier for anyone who
wants more information about that
because I was not conclusive I just
tweeted out the URL link that I had for
it so I'm aim DS chief technology
architect John Keller apparently said
blah blah blah sea islands encompasses
the ps4 chip as well as new mobile chips
and Bonaire GPU found in the seventies
so ninety I bring this up because it
shows people inside AMD continue to work
hard along hours to deliver great
products etc etc amongst the term well
shown in the press so the next
generation is coming this year and
shaping up nicely is what he says when
you name products after places it leads
to interesting thoughts about where to
hold the events surrounding the namesake
product it would be really cool if they
did an event on a volcanic island it'd
be a real shame if all their engineers
died in the volcano
so AMD if anyone's watching maybe just
do it somewhere else
that's they'll be pretty beast though
take some risk don't worry about it
so anyway that's really cool news I mean
AMD / - did you see their stock actually
I haven't looked at it since then maybe
it's gone down a bit but still boom is
it still exploding no I'm saying oh but
still it went boom went up a lot they
seem to be firing on at least one
cylinder now which is more than they
were before they were it was when we not
even that long ago wow we had this live
stream running it was pretty scary
looking pretty dire a few lashings were
we almost hinted - like oh god they've
got all the game devs on board now with
the graphics cards they've got releases
like coming when it looked like they
weren't gonna release anything yeah very
very exciting stuff so I'm really stoked
to check out 9000 series hopefully we
get one prior to launch so we can bring
you guys some launch content so that
didn't happen with 79 90 or 77 90 still
waiting Andy's trying actually there are
guys over there that are trying to get
us the allocation so we can show you
guys this cool stuff right when it comes
out let's move on to our next one which
is not a crack at EA and boom I'm gonna
need oh okay no bad language on the as a
huge lover of the Assassin's Creed
series okay well so this was posted
without probably too much helpful
information by XE your face on the forum
for that matter oh crap I don't think I
I don't think I called out our oh yeah
no I did but there you go Assassin's
Creed creator and designer fired
allegedly by Ubisoft so there's a bit
more to the story than that and Patrice
has said that they fired him Ubisoft has
said they parted ways due to a
difference in creative direction or some
some corporate speaks something along
those lines so he designed and created
the Assassin's Creed franchise which is
the favorite gaming franchise of at
least one of the people in this room
it's it ties guys
schools without this cold okay okay so
there's that however so his his
statement has been they fired him
unjustly
he's only been back for two months
because he left back in 2010 to go to
THQ and then he's been back for a couple
months we were not sure what he was
working on Forbes his article so
speculated that maybe he had a
disagreement with the yearly release
cycle proposed for Assassin's Creed I
think we've talked about that on the
live stream before we talked to I don't
know if Lucifer's has discrete okay
anyway yearly release cycles is like oh
no yeah we didn't talk about it for
sauces good I mean that's insane it's
like could you be any more public about
we're just gonna milk this I don't mind
if they come quickly and they're good
but fixing the release cycles is no I
hate that
fixing dates like release it when it's
done bring it on like throw more people
at the boil and make it fast
yeah awesome yeah but if there's a
problem like don't do a fixed date
please don't do a fixed date I'm fixable
the game and then release it so there's
some speculation maybe he didn't like
that there's some speculation that he
was actually working on completely
different things internally and it has
nothing to do with that but one way or
another he came out and made a statement
that went ah shoot I forget his wording
and I don't have that on there but
something along the lines of I'll defend
myself my team in my game and there will
be some kind of action but no one really
knows what it is
up till now so uh so there you go very
very interesting so that's out of
Ubisoft Montreal so my my Canadian my
Canadian Bros all right you've got some
sort of stuff to figure out over there
why do we do a little bit of Twitter Q&amp;amp;A
sure sorry guys I know Twitter Q&amp;amp;A is
just sort of random but it is what it is
so there you go and random is what it is
hey Ryan
hi Ryan ah they also fired the producer
of Assassin's Creed ok so it wasn't just
one person that's interesting part owing
a bit from the increases thank you James
I am doing a 32 crucial m4 raid 1 array
no it's a terrible idea with 3 or 4 raid
cards 48 SSDs maybe in the future you do
not need a raid 1 array with SS
let me tell you that if you're using for
high-performance raid cards which I'm
assuming you are you will actually
probably do just as well with something
like even a raid 6 because you'll be
able to do a massive random performance
with an array like that I mean honestly
you don't even probably need that many
SSDs like to max out the performance you
could probably even go for SSDs per card
or something along those lines
I really interested what is use cases
for what do you do if you need raid 1
grade reliability why are you using
consumer SSDs something you should be
asking yourself especially when he's
buying 48 48 SSDs I maybe in the future
okay I heard a rumor there's an
enterprise-grade SSD coming that's gonna
be very reasonably priced from not
crucial can't say who it is but it
should be coming soon cool maybe kind of
like an enthusiast sort of diamond in
the rough skew cool I'm going to sleep
now 2 a.m. in the Netherlands good night
Bart bird what games are you guys
looking forward to why don't we buy all
this hardware what game are you looking
forward to besides Blood Dragon which
you haven't played yet no but it's out
so I can't exactly look you can look
forward to it
I guess I can little baby freakin
accepted it said in the past so I'm
looking forward to 2007 Back to the
Future all over again well other schools
online but I'm hesitantly looking
forward to that because of some of the
problems that we have I'm gonna try and
not talk about this as much as I
possibly can
black flag so we've gone through the my
2 favorite series which we already
talked about it sounds a good life like
it's me like pirate version of
Assassin's Creed throw pirates barrel
pirates ok yeah not like pirated no hear
about the piracy game of piracy or like
it was the game about losing a game dad
it was the game dev and if you pirated
it they pirated your game in the game so
you could never be a successful game
developer if you pirated the game yeah
it was brilliant yeah and so there was
all these people complaining on the
forums about this I was an indie game
and I he released all the stats so he
had a non-personally identifiable like
tracker in the game that reported back
cult phoned home and let him know if it
was a pirate
real copy and it was some massive
percentage of of the games that were
being played were pirated and then what
happened is it was like game dev tycoon
kind of thing like game dev sim and so
people would reach a point where their
company would get to this size and then
they'd never be profitable because
everyone would pirate their game so they
were posting on the forums I can't
figure out how to get past this part
it's like this is ridiculous everyone
just pirates my game I can't be
successful yeah and then the irony was
like that that guy's having trouble
making ends meet because he can't be
successful because everyone guys you
pirated his game anyway sure so pirate
version of Assassin's Creed do you think
that's frustrating in the game that's
frustrating in real life let me tell you
as someone trying to run their own
business these days like the amount of
stress that you go through without
people stealing your work yeah is a lot
another thing that I'm really look
really looking forward to is a I'm
really still talking about this sequel
of outline Miami ok you even plead that
either no it's amazing how do you know
anything about the Razer Ouroboros
disappearing no no okay fine I'm playing
games 670 power edition or should I get
the 7950 you know what either of them's
a great choice
7950 has had the edge lately in our
testing particularly once overclocked
yoloswag 4g of age jesus is the new
official life's no it isn't first time
watching live yeah Ivan tuning in
tonight my boyfriend watches you guys hi
Elizabeth and boyfriend that was the
Ryan told you should be a it's a great
investment not just not just something
to do with is yeah a verb now I'm just
gonna EA that it could mean anything
release it ahead of schedule there won't
be any support you won't be able to
actually access it I'm gonna run the
ground I'm at yet if I'm not done
something I can just submit a corrupted
file and be like oh that's just II ate
let's inspect this and I'll be like uh
I'm not commenting so if anyone from EA
is watching guys we do need sponsors for
the show come on down why don't we move
on to our next topic
this this is very interesting so this is
another forum submitted topic so check
this out guys yeah I said this so
remember one power supply so this is
from list Fisker list Fisker yeah it's
from Norway so dude you're cool we love
you we love Norway your name so Lisp
Fisker from Norway says has well
compatibility of course their power
supplies has been released which leads
us to an interesting topic so most power
supplies are ready to go with as well
some are still to be confirmed and might
need some tweaks to function silverstone
has come out and said all of theirs are
working i see sonic i believe has a
compatibility list as well and there's a
good reason for this now back when I was
getting into computers a350 smart blue
that came with the Antec LAN boy was a
pretty good power supply and if you
really wanted you could get yourself a
true blue and that might be a 430 or
even a 480 watt fancy but then all of a
sudden after that it was this arms and
before that it was like you know
anywhere from 150 is sort of 250 watt
like there was this progression and then
after that it becames arms race to
bigger wattages ocz changed the game
with the power stream 520 watts there
was also a power stream 600 watt but it
had two 12-volt rails which meant that
with SLI configuration sometimes it
didn't work so the 520 watt was the
really well-regarded one after that
ultra had the 1300 watt power supply it
was like an external thing or maybe that
wasn't all try remember there was Wi-Fi
remember that though like you actually
needed two plugs in it and for it to
even output the maximum power you had to
have it hooked up to two circuits in
your house if you were in North America
I remember seeing build logs with it
must be like what do you
what are you doing and then case
manufacturers released cases that
accepted to power supply's so
Silverstone's tjo seven my case it's
like I use to the extra space for
radiators but you could put two thousand
watts favored stone Striders in there
you could have two thousand watts of
power anyway so it got kind of
ridiculous for a bit with wattage then
the efficiency race came 80 plus 80 plus
bronze eighty plus silver gold platinum
plutonium I don't want to plutonium I
thought I said opinion that's titanium
who cares um so the point is efficiency
became a big thing but now now what it
might be all about and the way 80-plus
works is that it's actually there is no
rating for how efficient the power
supplier has to be below twenty percent
load and what's funny is any thousand
watt power supply isn't gonna touch
twenty percent load might not even break
ten percent load with a modern system
running a Haswell CPU and a
next-generation graphics card because
they're getting so good at turning down
the power at idle so when you're
browsing the web your computer probably
doesn't suck a hundred Watts from the
wall so all of a sudden has well
particularly with its sleep states is
going to be much more sensitive to how
the power supply performs at extremely
low loads then it's going to be to how
it performs at high loads which is what
80-plus has been all about so I don't
know how this is gonna work because
right now
manufacturers are basically just putting
like a has well ready certification on
it I was kind of like the old p4 ready
where it had that connector and it had
the the beefier 12 volt rail because
those CPUs were drawing so much power
and it was game-changing now they're
drawing so little power you're gonna
need a high quality power supply but not
the same way you did before where it's
like massive wattage massive efficiency
at high loads
you're gonna want massive efficiency and
great performance with low ripple and
low noise at very low power consumption
what if this means we're gonna see a lot
of like maybe smaller in wattage and
size because of the smaller cases easy
marmosets more passive more passive more
smaller in size more smaller and wattage
but very feature-rich power supplies
things like what Corsair is implementing
with their ax I series where you've got
you know volt
monitoring and temperature monitoring
and more like more like bringing more
value to the power supply as opposed to
figuring out how to stuff more watts in
it so to speak yeah I know that's not
actually how power works you don't stuff
more watts in something he's beer all
over there he's working no he's probably
on his own workstation I would make way
more sense that makes way more sense
yeah why did he even set up diesels
thank you had to get some stuff off the
computer makes sense see this is why I
hate people to think for me
clearly not capable of it anyway so so
there that's a really interesting thing
about Haswell so even though you have an
awesome power supply it may not work
with as well so watch out check with
your manufacturer make sure it works
most of the good manufacturers should
have most of the power supplies working
so let's take a moment and do a little
bit of twitter twitter uh paying
attention this plutonium 1.21 jigowatts
oh that's probably whole areas oh we're
not we can't click we're not clicking on
this what about SPRO hilarious um I
actually don't drink coffee
can you imagine what I'd be like if I
drank coffee Oh be scary actually I
consume no stimulants no energy drink is
probably control on the roof like I
don't need it no I didn't even get that
much sleep last night
like first time watching from Norway
what are you thoughts um windows blue
we've actually talked about windows blue
a little bit some of the features that
are coming there was a preview that the
verge broke the news about imma take
sort of wait-and-see approach you know
what normally I'd be upset about this
Shawn because that's a cheap shot that
is a really cheap shot but after the
lockout I don't care and ten percent of
people know what we're talking about
Oh hockey hockey so the San Jose Sharks
beat the Vancouver Canucks in four
hockey games consecutively meaning the
Vancouver Canucks can no longer win the
Stanley Cup which is the coveted prize
it's a jock jockstrap different kind of
cup sorry my bad anyway normally I'd
care but
I just didn't yeah I just didn't care
Oh apparently I really need to read list
Fiske earns last post on that has wall
compatibility topic so we're gonna go
ahead and move down to where he has
posted some additional stuff ah
apparently Johnny guru came on to OSI 3d
and told him off for messing up his name
oh no oh wow
did you really spell Johnny guru like
that okay just so you guys know Johnny
guru is the website to go to for power
supply reviews you can come look at our
unboxing and we're gonna show you some
you know what the cable sleeving quality
looks like and what connectors are on it
how long they are in - arm lengths if
you want to know anything about a power
supply actually Johnny guru.com
they do the best power supply reviews
Bar None everything else is basically
worthless compared to what they do you
can quote me on that we don't do it
that's part of the reason why we don't
do why bother like why bother
we'll just put in system it'll look cool
and we'll talk about how it looks and
then and we'll talk about what we read
on Johnny guru because guys if you want
to know anything about a power supply if
Johnny guru recommended it and it got
even like seven out of ten or better
it's probably safe it's fine
buy it I'd be confident if it got nine
out of ten or ten out of ten on Johnny
guru that's B's one be prepared to pony
up because I tell you that is a
well-built power supply and number two
be confident because it's awesome okay
so anyway sort of back to back to
Twitter I would catch a live stream
several times but either I've overslept
or had problems with my live with my
laptop I'm trying I'm trying to scroll
down and having trouble twitter needs to
just calm down have you heard about that
one keyboard model disappearing - no yes
well exactly um
loving the street I think he thought the
Ouroboros was a keyboard loving the
stream tonight guys first time tuning in
live hila guy the guy Luke whatever your
name is watching live stream from Kuwait
speaking of Kuwait it was uh crap miss
Syria right Syria's no internet yeah no
internet I mean I don't gets back now
but Syria just disappear
from the internet like which was just
bizarre
so Syria yeah Middle Eastern country
internet went down basically they just
like turned it off and everyone was
constant here going like what holy crap
can you imagine so I'm not gonna get
into the political ramifications of all
of that because honestly I am NOT that
well versed in it and we're not those
people yeah
however what I would like you guys to
reflect on is in the last twenty years
basically how pervasive the Internet has
become in your life isn't it
mind-boggling what if the internet was
turned off in your country like my job
would just be impossible I know I
couldn't do my job
for like mail people DVDs right
it's like we'd have to be we'd have to
be uh oh crap what was that star
something what was that DVD service the
the mailing mail rental DVD thing oh
crap I have to look it up it was like it
was like something like Club or DVD mail
rental service or like you had to buy
them or something
oh okay hopefully someone can tell me on
Twitter maybe it was something something
club I don't know it wasn't it was an
old thing it was it was kind of on the
same level as like AOL CDs I was like
there were always pamphlets for this
stupid thing and I was like
anyway that's what tech tips will become
we'll just we'll mail you the latest
unboxings on like a monthly basis you
know no big deal but yeah what would it
even oh yeah oh no I don't know if this
is true I don't know this is true but
apparently if you go bankrupt in game
device tycoon ea buys you I kind of have
a feeling I have a feeling that's not
true but it'd be hilarious yeah bro do
you even a watching lay live for the
second time it's 4:00 a.m. thank you for
bearing with us on this no on this here
live streaming is pretty tough Ram for
budget gaming buy whatever what about
the Steam donation what about a steam
donation for Linus tech tips or you can
test with more recent games honestly
what recent games do we not test with
the only things I can think of I mean we
did BioShock Infinite we did Tomb Raider
we did we jumped over mark by 3 Crysis 3
we jumped over we're gonna do Metro last
light dart right start track in I know a
few people asked for that but it's not
like a huge like okay it's pretty big
but it's not it's not on the level of
like Bioshock and I have a segue yeah
sure um so speaking of Star Trek they
tried to do an MMO at one point yeah
which is sort of like wow because every
MMO is sort of like wow and Wow lost 1.3
million subscribers in q1 2013 wrap your
brain around that Wow
lost more subscribers in q1 then most
MMOs will ever get so I still have a
beast amount ok yes they still have 8
million it's down from the peak of 12
million and I've seen some posts on the
forum actually this was a this was a
forum post so I want to make sure that I
give credit where credit's due just to
interject again quickly after you this
was up we basically just crashed Johnny
guru oh no it works really it's still it
doesn't fully work some things aren't
loading
we go great site when it works takes
about four or five minutes fantastic
site go there some other time sorry
Donny sorry but you're awesome man and
Oklahoma wolf the guy who was doing most
of the reviews when I was reading a lot
more on there is awesome two great
writing style very funny anyway so I
can't find the thread I'm sorry to
whoever posted this thread on the forum
you're awesome and and I hurt you
someone will find it hopefully someone
will find it and tweet it
you know hashtag - you forgot or
something like that hashtag I don't know
man I'm just tweeted at you they could
but I don't know if everyone will see it
got me and I'll retweet it calm down
there's a thread on the forum where
people were saying that it's kind of in
between new content right now so it
might not be indicative of sort of you
know anything that crazy but think about
it this way over the course of a month
then having 1.3 million fewer
subscribers based on if everyone was
paying $15 a month would be almost
twenty million dollars of revenue that's
basically profit when you consider that
they have to invest in the
infrastructure they have to invest in
the content there's a lot of dev there's
a lot of support there's a lot of four
there eight million existing subscribers
they already have to do all that crap
anyway so that 20 million was the profit
if you think about it that way or was
basically profit because they had to do
all that other stuff anyway that is HUGE
on the bottom line of Activision I mean
they're basically saying don't worry
about it we're still number one you know
it's okay it's cool but here are a few
things that I wanted to discuss if while
we're to stumble would something just as
quickly pop up to take its place as a
paid game would something be able to
take its place we people even be willing
to pay for an MMO anymore I wish would
they be I I would personally I'm full I
don't like pay to play I'm very very
against pay to play yeah because almost
every single pay to play system no
matter how you look at it has at least a
little bit of pay to win it might not be
that much amazing
kro transactions versus
subscription-based yes okay oh sorry
probably shouldn't sorry
microtransactions worse then then
subscription-based description firstly I
don't mind subscription-based everyone's
on equal playing field no matter what
okay that's true always like doesn't
matter and everything you get in the
game is earned the same way that
everyone else would earn yes okay with
micro transactions no matter to what
scale unless it is only cosmetic and
I've even with only League of Legends is
largely cosmetic towards that so you can
still unlock champions within certain
game roads like the new around game mode
that they came up with can make things
better for you because if there are
clearly better setups of teams in a ROM
and you don't get to pick your champion
it's all random all mid so you got
random a champion so if you're just the
free week champions you had a
disadvantage compared to people that
have specifically really good champions
on air right okay a few people will come
at me and be like that's not the main
game mode all because it doesn't matter
a ton of people play it right it still
even though it's not competitive on a
tournament level it's no competitive
when you're just playing with your
buddies okay so so paying to enhance the
enjoyment experience okay so so riddle
me this then after Wow basically sort of
perfected it so to speak
is there really any innovation left in
MMO because you've got Eve as sort of
your your hardcore and I know you've got
World of Warcraft as sort of your
accessible MMO you've got all these
skeletons so many Age of Conan look how
long Star Wars The Old Republic was was
subscription-based what was it a few
months I mean is there is the is not so
much is there any innovation left
because I think there's a Novation left
and I think part of the problem with
mmo's is that they're not innovating I
think star citizen might be a way for
pretty story for swords yeah might be a
way for chris roberts to really show
that there's still room for a massively
multiplayer experience to innovate and
be different but is it because
all wild clones and our Studios gonna be
willing to invest what it would take to
design a new king from their own from
the ground up to replace Wow if it
faltered before I before I comment on
that and interject this is completely
different conversations I don't really
want to go to it but I hate the I hate
the term wild clone but that's a
completely different topic anyways I
don't really think so
I think studios will drop a bunch of
money ESO is dropping a whole bunch of
money but I don't at the same time
people complaining about the potential
graphics problems so they might not have
dropped the amount of money that they
should have we won't know until we get
open beta yeah but like everything else
to be able to even if it's Elder Scrolls
you think it'll be moddable at all not
textures I don't know but I know there
will be add-ons available okay okay so
anyway okay carry on anyways just don't
get too much into that um I don't think
it'll happen not on the scale that WoW
was because if you look at the timeline
for MMO releases Wow was perfect right
Ultima and EQ were old right there was
nothing else really really big on the
table okay Wow dropped everyone that was
tired of Ultima EQ because it was really
old moved to WoW and then they just
crushed it it was a big enough pool of
people that when new things came out at
the beginning it didn't matter because
all your friends played wow and you want
to play with your friends
so everyone wouldn't play wow they
exploded they were massive and I was
taking forever them for them to die
because it's still depending on your
playstyle a good game there's still a
lot of people to play it I don't like it
8 million people there's a ton of you'll
play it so I liked a classic Wow way
more but ok I don't think it'll happen
because to create that again there's so
many mmo's that are coming out all the
time right you can't hit that time so we
might end up with a more fragmented type
of market I don't think it's gonna be
the massive one game experience that it
basically was when wow first came out
right so then we might be a bit more
like a cyclical thing because you look
at something like okay let's look at
anything let's look at the development
of the graphics processing unit when it
started there was one yeah then there
was a couple then everyone in there dog
got in and then there was
then hick'ry consolidated so maybe we're
so so at the beginning there was really
only a couple yeah okay and then there
was the one dominant one for a long time
then maybe it's time for the end of that
I mean well it's the end of the one
dominant one then it's spread out like
crazy so basically you could actually
couple in the very few that were at the
beginning and the one dominant one
probably into the same bracket right
into the same sort of present I not many
yeah and then success tons yeah and then
too many so it narrows back down that's
actually a really that might actually
help you so many things are like that I
mean it's been done time and time and
time and time and time again by the way
that was actually Kilmer that posted the
Wow thing okay Kilmer was this coming
was a mod on our forum and he has
stepped down because he just doesn't
have time which is that's cool that's
cool we totally get it yeah yeah a
blizzard is busy with a new MMO called
titan should be a ground up game at if
there's anyone who can do it again it'll
be Blizzard but there's also gonna be so
much more scrutiny on it oh my goodness
with that said Blizzard has shown
they're committed to fixing stuff yeah
yep yeah three is apparently a much
better experience than it whatever that
is well I haven't actually stepped back
and played it but I've definitely heard
that from not a small group of people
and like Titan like you just said
scrutiny that thing will be combed with
like a brick people will find combed
with the brick people mean like
everything will be looked at combed with
a brick okay that's fine tooth comb
that's a quotable no this is beyond
somebody mean this please I'm trying to
explain combed with a brick to me okay
comb there's fine-tooth comb beyond that
this is like brick brick tooth come here
you're fired nope no you're fired oppa
that got it gotta say Linus from felon
you're gonna be careful when you tell
half-a-million people about a website
well he's a little bit exaggerating I
think right around 3,500 by the way
thank you so much guys we are
overwhelmed that there are so many
people tuning in to the live stream you
guys all rock that is huge I mean I was
marveling the other day
you were showing me day nine stream
where he had what about 12 k people
watching or something like that I don't
remember I think he's like ten point
five ten point five and I was just like
you know what I feel huge just when a
third as many people is day nine tune in
to watch me so I was a beast
I felt pretty cool about that I know
we're not asking for as much of a time
commitment as him and we don't stream as
much as him all that kind of stuff but I
still felt cool where are the cool
shades cool shades closely it's can you
reach them your arms are longer than
mine yes
okay I'm gonna wear the cool shades for
the rest of the stream but you broke I
didn't fully break them these are my
glasses uh I was wearing them in some
video where we're standing there jumping
and he's wearing his boots and they
never ended up releasing the segment
either no we should release it just as
like a DVD like behind the scenes I got
bumped in the face and they fell off my
face and between under his boots and now
they no they say I think I knock them
off your face yes yeah I was a saving
face thank you thank you you just said
face a lot yeah your face um one of my
mom's just brought up a good think Daisy
that kind of happened with Daisy there
was one but it was like everyone make a
zombie survival game yeah and now it's
kind of coming back down again coming
back down to just a few that survived
survived I can't take you seriously your
glasses her so uh the zombie game zombie
apocalypse at what point do games that
were dead come back from the dead and
steal back the title I actually can't
take you seriously I don't know if it
looks it doesn't look as bad in the feed
it looks ridiculous when I look at them
head-on it's probably worse I think it's
the angle that helps a little bit right
seems like it could be anyway why don't
we just why don't we just get back to
Twitter here um any good gaming headsets
and mice to buy that are around 60 80
bucks lots of good mice razer deathadder
2013 edition 6400 dpi optical gaming
mouse great rubber grips on the sides
that's on at NCIX for $59.99 it's you do
15 or 16 mm as for gaming headsets
honestly you can get a Siberia v2 for
that price it's comfy its lightweight it
sounds okay gaming headsets really
aren't
way to go if you want a great audio
experience with the exception of the
SteelSeries 7h and some of Sennheiser's
higher-end stuff but you're not going to
get any of those things for sixty to
eighty dollars
yeah or if you have a big head because
the Sennheiser 7h is not good for people
with big heads um okay so frostbite says
he thinks Guild Wars 2 does mm all the
best you can buy the game for a price my
brother I haven't played Guild Wars 2
but my brother loves Guild Wars 2 he
plays it casually he finds the
experience is just you jump in and you
can just kind of go around and do
whatever you want and it's it's he finds
it like relaxing and nice instead of
like just the oh my god everything's
going on all the time these Blood Pact
says don't even complain about lack of
innovation if you didn't even try the
secret rule which I did not so we just
got told also didn't we just got told
Guild Wars 1 apparently had four million
active users at one time um I suppose
Jonny's fourth post since you registered
back in 2010 Wow
pwned so hard electronic mass production
by Zeo I think it's supposed to be EA
apparently in that game oh ok so back to
news items we have a ton this week paid
YouTube subscriptions they be here so
this was posted by speed stacks 79 he
didn't really give us any sort of an
editorial on it but there you go so you
can check out the paid channels there's
prices ranging from $1 to sort of just
under $10 and sort of anything in
between I'd like to say one thing at the
beginning here and hopefully you guys
can take me seriously in spite of these
glasses - tech tips will never be a paid
channel so there you go written in blood
as far as I'm concerned
unless YouTube forces everyone to take
paid subscriptions which I really don't
see because I'm sure we can be ad
supported as long as we need to be
absurd Linus tech tips will not be a
paid channel we will always continue to
try to take money from corporate
sponsors as much as we can to make the
channel possible to pay the salaries of
the people involved
I mean honestly we prefer it that way
we'd be willing to do something like a
tip jar or a Bitcoin mining pool or even
things like kick starters if we need
equipment or we wanted
something really special we think you
guys will benefit but we are not going
to do paid subscriptions we might do
things like special tags on the forum
for contributors all these things but
you will always have access to the
content online is tech tips no question
a public resource yes can sweet consider
it like I mean we're doing a service to
everyone the way we look at it we're
doing a service to the manufacturer by
showcasing their product to people we're
doing a service to the viewer by
showcasing the cool new products that we
can get our hands on and show you guys
so the way we see it is everyone
benefits if as many people watch it as
possible and that has always been the
philosophy of Linus tech tips so there
you go and try ok if you're posting
something a new section try to put a
little bit of input in please please
please input something it's helpful so
here we go mr. crisis mm submitted this
one about the Galaxy s4 zoom and you
know what's hilarious is I predicted
this one yep BAM I actually but I don't
know if I predicted it cuz I didn't
think anyone would make it no but what I
said was the only problem with Samsung's
Galaxy camera which is basically just an
Android powered camera it doesn't have a
cell phone in it they had to add such
little stuff to it to make it a cell
phone yeah and I was like cuz it already
had a persistent data connection you
could put a sim in it but it just didn't
have the calling hardware and I wonder
if it was in there and they just didn't
enable it like seriously oh no people
want this okay yeah but I mean think
about this guys if you're a shutterbug
or a blogger would you rather have a
slim phone that doesn't take that great
pictures I mean this one does okay this
is the one and honestly the s4 does okay
but it'll always be limited by the size
of the optics you can put in the bump
the distance the size of the sensor you
can put in all those things would you
rather have a slim phone that takes kind
of shoddy pictures or would you rather
have a camera that also acts as a phone
not everyone's on their phone all the
time
and it's got a nice big screen on the
back just like the galaxy camera so yeah
guys post not in this thread in the
forum because apparently our site can
take the heat
what's up Johnny
so 16 megapixel camera with a phone
built in we're it on the street is
Samsung something something blah blah
blah okay has an amo LED screen Android
jellybean eight gigs memory Bluetooth
4.0 speculation something something
something etc etc second do you guys
think this is a cool idea you know what
I'd like to take let's let's talk to the
twitch chat one quick thing it's a
wretched hive of scum and villainy but I
love it that way
plenty 3000 on Australian camera
reviewer said that its battery life is
not very good
scaling around three hours Samsung why
you do these things to me
it would be nice
someone says in twitchchat your glasses
are messed up sorry go ahead yeah I do
want to do this so talk quickly if
you're gonna say something because I
want to start talking about twitch chat
okay yeah so okay guys so what do you
think - fix your glasses I'd prefer the
phone take off those glasses give me a
shout-out to Mars or something along
those lines more memes MMO Neverwinter
Kate I something something I prefer the
Thicke phone with aggressive battery
that's another one we've talked about
maybe not even a great camera or maybe
you could put a better camera and if you
had a thicker so you should unbox the
courser 350d we have actually done that
it's sitting over there unboxed I just
have to upload it and see IX website
looks like a child designed it you know
what one of my friends actually used to
be my boss now we're more friends he
doesn't work there anymore designed that
website and back when it was designed it
was not bad prefer a phone not and a
separate camera okay fair enough
the twitch chat exploded okay someone's
saying put it on slow I prefer the
camera but not without battery life okay
so there you go we took some feedback
from twitch chat today thank you very
much guys
so let's go back to our net okay what
were you gonna say I just I wanted to
talk to them before they it's cool that
you can at least throw us a minute now
and talk on the thing what the battery
life is so low that is problem problem
although with portable battery packs if
your hold net around you probably have
some sort of a bag right you could
charge it up with a portable battery
pack so this right here was submitted by
back Grund thank you very much for this
awesome submission background as rock is
apparently planning to release
water-resistant motherboards in their OC
formula series associated with the Intel
Haswell release what do you think about
this is waterproof motherboards
the future for water cooling guys are
will it be just a new gimmick background
I got a you know what I gotta give you
credit for giving some some feedback on
the topic but I think you got it kind of
wrong here unfortunately what this is
going to be great for is sub-zero
cooling not water cooling when it comes
to water cooling the
danger is not so much to the motherboard
because usually by the time your leak
testing your motherboard is vertical and
is unlikely to be spilled on the danger
is usually to your graphics card or your
power supply getting water dripping into
it and it can sit there and cause
problems by sitting there big problems
because distilled water is not
inherently conductive but once it sits
and gets some soldering flux in it or
some metal ion boot that's when you run
into trouble but this is great for as
guys who are doing sub-zero overclocking
where condensation can be a big issue
and insulating boards perfectly can be a
big difference between that modded board
that the overclocker spent hours getting
working just right like even days
getting working just right working and
then dying because one little bit of
water got in there condensation boom
dead so that's really cool having it be
water resistant for extreme overclocking
I mean also for extremely humid
environments would this be a benefit I
don't know it must I know that's a
problem maybe I don't know I guess if
you spilled your you put in so many huh
so many cases have mesh tops you knock
your drink over there they have two
friends that I know that have done that
they're pouring a can of cola on it in
the in the picture here but guys just
because it's waterproof does not mean
it's Cola proof no so people are still
in the twitch chat there's like - his
glasses are crooked yeah I know
and the other really cool thing about
this board is HDMI input holy freakin
crap how cool is that because some
consoles notably the Xbox 360 and you
know game streamers are able to utilize
this as well do not have DRM so if you
had an HDMI input right on your board
you know what you capture card costs
like a hundred bucks if you had an HDMI
input on your board you could actually
capture from an external sorry I don't
know if this is what they're intending
to use it for but that would make this
board more gaming optimized than any
gaming branded board I've ever seen huh
yeah I know that's awesome I mean better
audio actually I stand by that better it
whatever solutions good but I probably
put a sound card in anyway
so for me with so many people game
streaming these days I'd say putting an
HDMI input on your board is a cool way
to make it gaming optimized yeah
straight which is pretty stupid yeah
great features for the overclockers
great features for the gamers very cool
board with that said as rock is still
not really on my list of motherboard
manufacturers that I pay too close
attention to but if they keep doing cool
stuff like this that might turn 360
degrees just kidding guys 180 if you
weren't in the live stream earlier you
won't get the joke so just calm down I
know it's not 360 um this is kind of
gross it's very gross this is actually
super gross but Alex be on Twitter
submitted this to me the the ultimate
Canadian computer and I really hope that
Canada is not about taxidermy beavers
with computers inside them but it's an
ITX build very old like crappy
components with a taxidermy beaver yes
that is a real beaver with a fan in the
back let me see if I can skip to the
spot where it's like there there's the
i/o accessible through like a flap
there's the beaver sitting on a desk is
that not the scariest thing you guys
have ever seen with this beaver sitting
next to the monitor here holy freaking
schmoly anyway I'm pretty sure this is
an older thing but I just I hadn't seen
it before so apparently the beaver pick
was posted on reddit a couple days ago
so it's probably where they saw it but
yeah just like the most bizarre thing
ever
we have almost 3600 live viewers Wow
and they all unfortunately had to just
see that yeah I'm sorry guys you know
what we probably just shouldn't have
done that no slit told me not to do it
but I did I was like yeah alright so
it's time to take another shot a TA oh
no this is the biggest one the Walt
Disney Company and EA announced
multi-year Star Wars games agreement
submitted by PC explosion I believe was
the first one to submit this on the
phone come on I will forgive so many
things if you don't screw this up like
please don't screw this up
come on if anyone from EA is watching
just come on they got him take the
glasses off
no I'm putting them back on that's okay
but temporary temporary it's like come
on don't screw this up not only that but
it's exclusive so the odds of me getting
like a remade TIE fighter anytime in the
multi-year deal not gonna happen
mind you EA is sort of the masters of
remaking things yes true maybe if I get
a remade TIE fighter out of this EA
employees who are watching I will be
super stoked that isn't like oh yeah to
buy to buy another like ship you need to
microtransaction yeah oh you don't have
Luke Skywalker content hey $15 yeah okay
okay maybe be careful what you wish for
I guess because I could I could end up
with my game but broke yeah exactly so
cuz you're gonna buy everything I
totally know I know if someone asked me
to spend $500 on a TIE fighter remake
with modern graphics but just the exact
game maybe throw in multiplayer
okay I'd pay $500 for a single-player
alone and for multiplayer like for my
own personal copy owing him not even
slightly surprised you could probably go
home you know I can't afford it you'd
probably still do it everyone you know I
can't afford it you probably saw your
bike but I'd do it I would do it like I
would do it just four times just for TIE
fighter and if this were in the x-wing
campaign - OH
and like they've got some of their
better publishers behind it I mean
imagine if they got James Earl Jones to
come in and do the Darth Vader voice oh
yeah I'm gonna have to go change my
pants so anyway under the deal it's
exclusive except for a few like lame
casual platforms like tablet games or
kids games
it looks like the dads who gonna be
working on it are actually I wrote this
down in my thing this are all dice and
Bioware yeah we'll be diving the game so
this is the lesser of all evils as far
as things look yeah he's making a big
deal out of how some new Star Wars game
is gonna use frostbite who cares as if
the engine ever made the game TIE
fighter is one of the greatest games
ever it looks like ass it doesn't hurt
but doesn't hurt but still it's not like
I'm looking at it going wow when Darth
Vader cut off Luke Skywalker's hands I
could really see the blood spurt you
couldn't even see any blood in the movie
that doesn't make it not a great movie
so there's my whole thing anyway so I
was willing to give Disney the benefit
of the doubt on the whole acquisition as
far as movies are going
I was actually willing to give them the
benefit of the doubt on closing down
Lucas arts like I was like okay if they
find some great dads to do this maybe
they can rejuvenate it but come on this
is not oh I would like beg on hands and
knees for EA not to screw this up yeah
wait let's do it right now okay okay
okay okay
employees who are watching okay we can
we can kneel on the chairs I think it's
proper least my chair spinning I'm okay
okay okay so okay we're sort of kneeling
ei please don't screw so please don't do
not oh and like are they even gonna
release 1313 which is like probably
close to done oh I'm so worried for how
this is how many people are tuned in
right now oh well we started hitting on
EA all the employees left so apparently
there were 40 of them watching hopefully
we don't get fired okay our last topics
before we do our bill Glatt boob long
swab build bogs of the week yes I you
know I have a lot of potential sponsors
this was submitted by Joel the zombie 15
this was actually a while ago I meant to
talk about this this last week I think
but hmm a lot of the sponsors have sort
of asked me how many likes I have on
Facebook and sort of things like that
I've never done a like like me on
Facebook tool and I've never done
anything like that I've never really
pushed Facebook to me Facebook is one of
those things where most of the content
on there is stuff that I share that
people sent me on Facebook things like
builds or like cool pictures or funny
things that I think are funny
most of my Twitter content goes on there
all my Instagram content goes to Twitter
which then goes to Facebook so what
Facebook is really is it's for people
who are
Facebook anyway don't feel like
following on Twitter don't feel like
subscribing on YouTube but still want to
have a way to get access to the content
and whatever it is I'm talking about so
that to me Facebook is like my like like
quaternary priority out of everything
that I do but a lot of people won't get
I'm still gonna sorry so it's so it's
primary secondary tertiary quaternary
fourth priority so but I'm gonna support
it just because I know some people
prefer it which is great
but I this is this is really funny so
what's a facebook like worth because I
get questioned by sponsors why don't you
have a lot of likes on Facebook you're
huge on YouTube you've got a big Twitter
following you've got all these things
what why are you so small on Facebook
and I go well because a facebook life
doesn't really mean anything it's been
cheapened to the point where what does
it even do so UNICEF has launched a bold
advertising campaign that takes direct
aim perhaps the most ubiquitous form of
online activism the Facebook like I like
you know people against animals being
tortured I mean that's that's great you
know what I'm against animals being
tortured too and I'm gonna go ahead I'm
gonna say that but late last month
UNICEF Sweden released three commercials
that urge viewers to support
humanitarian aid not through posts or
shares on social media but through
monetary donations Facebook Likes do not
save lives they do not save animals they
do not save the environment they do not
do anything technically it's an X amount
of data so the only thing it could
possibly do is hurt the environment
that's true a hard drive had to be my
install Drive had to be created data had
to travel along paths energy was
consumed so something happened somewhere
yeah so anyway there you go we are we
are disappointed that anyone ever
thought that Facebook Likes actually did
anything positive I mean the kinds of
things I like on Facebook are things
like my local badminton crew yeah it's
like because that way when they're
trying to attract a sponsor for their
tournament or whatever they might have
more likes or something they have more
legs which they can show them and so
there's that but at the at the end of
the day like a like has become so
meaningless because
everyone has turned it into just giving
crap away for likes which I've done a
couple times on Twitter and I've done a
couple times on YouTube so follow the
have a chance to win subscribe to have a
chance to win but I think the point of
those ones is the ongoing dialogue I
don't use Twitter as just a way to sell
tech tips to a sponsor I don't need it
we have three hundred and fifty thousand
subscribers on YouTube on one channel
alone already
we have grown tech quickie in the last
three months to 50,000 subscribers which
is bigger than most YouTube channels
will ever be we're really good at video
I don't need to sell subscribers the
things I like about social media are the
two-way dialogue YouTube comments are a
very difficult way for me to interact
with you guys
whereas Twitter is great for life I'm
able to read your tweets in real time
almost live-streaming is great for
interaction Facebook is okay for
interaction I don't like that it's not
real time I mean what's great about
Twitter is if people tweet me and I'm
like laying in bed and I can't sleep I
can be like yeah I can reply to some
tweets it's cool it's interactive
whereas if Facebook Likes and and and
Twitter shares and whatever whatever
crap it all is is is just a way for me
to like pump myself up and beef myself
up and make myself look good then it's
completely lost the point and that's
what a lot of these activists that are
sitting at their computers sort of
flicking through their feed going like
oh yeah baby photos baby photos oh well
I don't like starving monkeys come on
guys anyway
there you go it's like New Age chain
mails apparently people want - social
media tips believe it or not I'm
reasonably good at it so I would be
happy to give you guys some social media
tips if you're really that into it build
blogs of the week here is you know what
we're gonna start with our legendary one
there was a thread in the forum last
week complaining that we do too much
legendary build log nests so we're
starting with we're starting with the
legendary one haha anyway I'm gonna let
Slick handle this so this is function
down in order to think you think you can
handle listen we're showing them it this
time which is great I'm gonna go get a
drink of water do you want one sure I've
been talking a lot in life
his parched you're just really energetic
today I'm tired we're gonna take it slow
yeah that he's gone slow and relaxed
this is tech tips fm
we're gonna take this exactly at the
speed you wanted all right so this is
another bill by sniffs Neff is actually
pretty kind of insane I think we
featured one of his builds before
hey stuff is just absolutely epic so
we're just gonna go through some
pictures here this I do not think is how
it ended up appreciate water cooled it
but we will see ah there we go
so you've got a sabertooth asus board
normally comes in brown he doesn't care
so he took the armor off on the top he's
painting it here my goodness I can't
control this little tiny keyboard like
Linus does my hands are way too big for
this let's go up here so you can
actually see it doesn't work I'm sorry
everyone
this keyboard is impossible for me to
use so he's painting everything like it
like a eggshell white I'm terrible with
colors that might not be accurate it's
some form of white and it looks really
good you can see reservoir Clips right
there oh I'm so excited this looks so
good I'm trying to go through slowly but
it looks amazing
white thankfully festivals are awesome
just look at that like aren't you just
if you haven't seen this yet if are you
just excited like you know this is gonna
look amazing
it looks so just I see blue angel I
don't even know how else to describe it
just such a nice color white coming out
here telling the fans is a dangerous and
bold move but hopefully it turned out
well here's this reservoir XSP see
radiator sorry for that jump no every
good at controlling this keyboard which
has a trackball on it do you he was just
showing off a lot of his tubing's and
fittings and stuff he always picks like
Oh snaps builds are always insanely
baller thank you I just got water on
both of our laptops and all my life no
that's pee Oh
you think you'd be used to it by now
where are the here we go here's the
completed pictures absolutely beasts
like we expect from snap Wow
just absolutely B's holy crap that's
beautiful yep
you missed the like nice in progress
shots you came in right as we got to the
completed shot sniff we featured him
before his builds are top-notch like
this is crazy that is outstanding I love
it painted saber-tooth painted rad power
more different painted rad that tubing
arrangement you know what it's funny
because the more perfect it is the more
you notice the mistakes see it's not
quite a right angle on the top of the
front rad oh it's off by a little bit
but it's you know what it's one of those
things where it's like it's easier to
see the flaw because the rest of it is
so perfect I love it and also that that
power supply needs to have the color
swapped on the TX in the end Wow look at
that fluid is it cold I don't remember
but I know the stuff you talk you know
about yeah yeah man that looks good and
I like the only slightly blue sleeping
on the cables yeah it would have been
nice to see it go all the way to the
power supply you got a point with the
aeronaut point with the finger oh so it
means the black cables coming out of the
power supply itself like it looks like
it was a little bit phoned in there I
wonder if he's using extensions
that would you know what you could do a
build like this reasonably quickly if
you did that this wouldn't even take
that long
mask off your radiators paint them you
still have to do it you can tell he
planted this out like crazy because of
his tubing runs and yes planning wise
but if you were to look at his build get
a parts list and execute it you could
probably do it without that much
difficulty cool
very good oh that looks good hmm that's
a really nice case - Wow and now with
LED huh sure gets more and more
pornographic as we go
man and those fans look amazing huh
those are spectres right yeah that's
right you're pros
yeah just so nice and going a little bit
faster now cuz you've seen a lot of this
already so so so nice I'm starting to
notice that power supply more yeah I
know right
just cuz the rest of its perfect oh he's
got like a proper proper setup oh yeah I
mean you know what honestly he's using a
monitor to light it up half of what
that's fantastic
half of half of like nice builds a lot
of the time is photography like I've
seen builds on million dollar PC that
quite frankly aren't really anything
special and if you looked at them in
person you really wouldn't be that
impressed right but when you when you
take great pictures with the gorgeous
depth of field and perfect lighting are
you gonna go to the next bill budgetary
when you are when you take great
pictures of them with like gorgeous
depth of field and perfect lighting then
they look amazing so we're we're almost
done the live stream we've just got one
more build log to go and guys we are
gonna be doing a Mario World after-party
again now there's it's gonna take us a
little while to get it set up but we are
we're ready this time we have a CRT for
us and we're actually going to be using
a different streaming setup let me know
when you're ready to go we're gonna be
using a different room you're ready
whenever okay I'll talk about this after
good for you I seen yeah alright we're
going again with kind of the white theme
sorry about that
building up sss DX right off the bat
just ooh ooh love SSD eggs it looks
great really nice pictures again but
we're just getting started you'll see
something has e takes off the backplate
you'll see where this is going pretty
soon I'm gonna skip through some of the
more just general shots there beautiful
lovely nabad plates just so beefs again
I know white build maybe next week we'll
try and make sure that we don't have any
more white builds but that seems to be
flavor of the month right now and just
so you guys know it's not gonna affect
performance back plate doesn't really
contribute anything to card cooling
we're talking maybe a degree or two yeah
maybe so it looks amazing
that's slang we go into it just showing
more part you can use page down as well
I know but it jumps too fast I find
right okay I guess we want people to be
able to follow along yeah my thumbs so
freaking big I can't believe we have
more than 3,500 years this week you guys
Rock those galets yes Yellin fans guys
silent twelves and then he raps as far
as I can tell he draft didn't actually
put his own tubing on but he wrapped it
yeah huh so it looks really good huh
like it still looks awesome that's
really smart
yeah yeah it's brilliant cuz it looks
great but then it like right but yeah so
there's a lot of like 50 things with
this bill that I really appreciate it so
with those two small little things I
guess there's two small little things
once we down to it like they're fairly
minor changes with the mouse pointer not
your finger I'm trying to keep it locked
on this cooler anyways so he wrapped the
tubing sorry I jumped which like looks
really good yeah and it's not a crazy
crazy thing to do he painted the back
plate which is again not a crazy crazy
thing to do but looks really sharp to
things that most people wouldn't do but
he thought of I like the little blue
accents on the motherboard with the rest
of the build being otherwise black and
white it looks really sharp yeah yeah
coming down to it cable management on
the box backs nothing special this is a
very attainable build yep so just it
just looks awesome it's not a 650 TI 660
yes I can't see through these awesome
glasses they're amazing there you go
that should be easy to read gorgeous
yeah awesome build again kind of white
and blue so they're both pretty similar
in that aspect but they were both really
good build so I didn't want to skip one
nice keyboard yeah goes along with the
bill that's one thing that's really cool
too is when people sync up their entire
bill mm-hmm so everything works together
it's like all your peripherals all your
case you're inside lighting everything
all works together it's really cool
all right so guys we will be back in
probably it's gonna take us about 10 or
15 minutes because we've got a new
streaming setup for our Mario afterparty
which will hopefully help slick not
perform it so I'll probably still be
terrible
off the last week was and I have a USB
to SNES adapter in the mail so we're
gonna be switching to SNES controllers
hopefully next week or the week after
but we're using an AVerMedia live gamer
portable now on a notebook then we have
another more different notebook that is
going to be outputting - wait hold on
okay so the live gamer portable is on
this one which will be the streaming
machine then the other notebook is
outputting to the CRT because it has VGA
out and it has HDMI out so then it is
outputting to the live gamer portable
which is running on the other computer
that is actually doing the streaming so
oh yeah the special guest moved to next
week great question I should have
covered that before so the Steve dotto
will be joining us next week oh yeah I
probably should have told you that no I
got that email you did okay I sent you
an email
yeah like first time ever actual proper
communication happened yeah all right
really
um so so anyway it'll take us a little
while to set it up guys stay tuned we
will be back and thank you for checking
out the lines tech tips livestream all
34:16 of you that are left that wanted
to listen to me do this like lead-out
thing and for those of you who are still
here I will remove my sunglasses because
they're absolutely ridonculous more than
one person without the OCD was like a
Hoka hi please take them off I can't
handle me the only reason I could handle
