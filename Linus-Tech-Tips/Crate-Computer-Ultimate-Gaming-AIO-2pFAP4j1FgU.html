of Rome 2 total war click now to learn
more this is the first time we've ever
done a system review on - tech tips and
frankly I wasn't a hundred percent sure
where to start well you might be
thinking to yourself well - you could
start by showing us the system rather
than a monitor I would reply to that I
am showing you the system this is heavy
and it's the crate computer from crate
computers and it is one heck of a unique
high performance gaming system so let's
kick things off with an overview of who
exactly this is built for I mean I see
this as the ultimate land machine or the
all-in-one PC for people who think being
limited in terms of performance and
upgrades the way a traditional
all-in-one would be is for chumps ok but
the next question you might ask me is
well why would I even want an all-in-one
and you know what I don't have a solid
answer because personally I'm good with
my full tower I've got a whole house
with three whole people living in it one
of whom is a baby and I never ever move
my computer but for the folks that are
interested in all-in-ones I'd love to
hear from you in the comment section
tell me what is appealing about the
all-in-one forum Factory you've got the
PC and the monitor and they take up
basically the same footprint as just a
monitor I mean the way that I see it is
on put in putting words in your mouth
but this is for folks that want the
flexibility to be able to pick up and
move it wherever they need to go and the
space savings to have their entire high
performance gaming rig take up as much
space as a monitor I mean I'm going to
go out on a limb here and say that if
that's what you're trying to achieve the
crate computer has a higher performance
2 footprint ratio than pretty much
anything else on the market the system
arrives extremely well packed the Box
both the outer one and the accessory one
has a spray-painted logo on it and the
inside of the packaging uses those oh
yeah you get a t-shirt well kind of like
a nice side polo and then the inside you
those bags that expand and fill in the
gaps as the chemicals inside mix I'm
really glad to see Crate be smart and
use these they are really really
expensive but they're the only real
option for small companies who are
serious about their computers arriving
in one piece and are not shipping high
enough volume to justify fully custom
packaging so next up is a tour of the
outside the front is a monitor that's
sort of a derp moment there it's an
all-in-one so it stands to reason you
can actually pick your monitor on their
website this particular one is a
viewsonic 1080p 27 inch LED backlit one
but they have a 24 inch there's also a
3d capable gaming monitor four masseuse
and what's cool is that if you ever
decide down the line to switch to
something else the attachment system
used here between the system and the
monitor is a standard vase amount so
you'll have the option to change to
something else if you want that's a nice
touch from a DIY ARS perspective the
monitor stand is where things start to
get interesting it's one of the heaviest
most robust feeling hunks of solid metal
that I've ever encountered on a computer
I guess given that it's designed to hold
a 27-inch screen and a full gaming
computer means that that sort of makes
sense but I was still in awe of it when
I pulled it out of the box with much
difficulty unfortunately it replaces the
stock stand so you lose any tilt swivel
height adjust or any other adjustments
that you would normally be able to make
to the monitor you'll pretty much put it
down on your desk and short of an
aftermarket riser to put it on top of
something or something like that that is
pretty much how you will use it on the
top we don't find a whole lot there are
a couple of decorative fasteners so
hopefully you guys can see that okay
then on the right side we find these
stickers that matter including the
windows KOA and a core i5 sticker as
well as a single lone power switch the
left side is full of ventilation holes
but there are no fans installed WTF ah
yes here on the back we find out that
cooling is handled by four 120
millimeter fans all of them configured
by default as intake which I'll touch on
more later at the bottom we find a nice
little short DVI
cable that's already hooked up running
between the monitor and the PC IO
courtesy of an EVGA stinger mini ITX
motherboard and to power input since
this is kind of a DIY all-in-one and
you'll have to run two separate power
cords in order to get her fired up
opening up the system it's actually
quite simple just remove the eight
knurled thumb screws on the back and you
can pop it right off the first thing I
noticed is that those fans that we saw
from the outside those 120 millimeter
fans are actually cougar fans the second
thing I noticed is that the back has a
nice decorative great computers logo on
it but that's actually protective as
well as being stylish so it separates
the intakes of the fans from any
obstructions that might be behind the
computer by a little bit just so that no
matter what there will be enough of a
gap for you to get some airflow in there
the third thing I noticed unfortunately
was the use of a stock intel cooler ouch
inside a small case like this I would
have to at least initially question the
wisdom of that but I will let the
performance tests tell the whole story
the system is compatible with two and a
half inch drives only but you can use
any thickness so while this one is
configured with a single 500 gig Neutron
SSD from corsair and create computers
offers up to a one terabyte hard drive
as an additional option because it's not
light restricted you could even go after
market and pick up a WD 15 millimeter
thick 2 terabyte two and a half inch
drive to go with your boot SSD for great
performance and tons of storage wiring
inside is handled very tightly with all
the cable management done behind the
motherboard tray although I've got a
question the use of a very industrial
looking power supply it's a 600 watt 80
plus bronze unit so that's all good so
far but that tiny little fan actually
two fans seemed like they would get
unreasonably loud the manufacturer went
with Patriot Viper series Ram actually
16 gigs in there and I'm not really
particular about memories so as long as
it runs well on this board I have no
quarrels with that choice we also find
ah yes here we go finally an E
eg a GTX 780 with an AC X style cooler
on a PCI Express extension their PCI
Express extension solution is actually
one of the most interesting things about
the case design it positions the card
right next to the external events on
that left-hand side which is definitely
a plus
given that the card uses an open-air
design cooler and it would be dumping
heat all around it and it also seems to
utilize some kind of like shock mount
system that appears to have some flex to
it rather than being firmly bolted in
place this may seem like a pretty
questionable thing to the casual
observer but in my estimation this
should actually give the card a better
chance of making it to your door by
acting as a bit of a shock absorber
during shipping it did manage to arrive
here in Canada on one piece at least and
while that is a small sample size it's
at least proof that it's not guaranteed
to cause problems the centerpiece
internally is of course the EVGA z87
mini ITX motherboard that makes this
whole creative unique and very
interesting system possible now moving
on to performance the number one concern
I have about any compact gaming machine
is thermals we saw this with the ass
rock m8 which is actually a similar size
although it doesn't strap to the back of
a monitor but that one uses 60
millimeter cooling fans which in their
stock configuration will actually cause
a GPU of this calibre to throttle even
at stock frequency so I wanted to put
the crate to the test the unreasonable
unrealistic test that is wha-ha-ha my
opening salvo was good old fir mark it
rose to 80 degrees on the GPU which is
perfectly normal but what was impressive
was the fact that it was still running
at over 900 megahertz boost clock which
is the advertised average boost clock of
a reference GTX 780 so either EVGA ACX
cooler or the cooling in the chassis
itself is doing its thing pretty
effectively and fir mark ran just fine
without any tweaks this is a very solid
result and it means that heat is not an
immediately
being factored like it would be on many
cases this size such as the
aforementioned asrock m8 and I mean most
cases the size won't even fit a GTX 780
and them never mind cooling it
adequately my next test was for the CPU
only so I ran prime95 with 4 threads on
the 4670 k which is enough to pretty
much fully load it and we got a result
of around 75 degrees that's okay that's
great that's fine but it wasn't until I
loaded up fir mark at the same time with
an open-air cooler on the GTX 780 in
this tiny little case that I got really
impressed because that is a ton of heat
to deal with in a very small space and
the CPU only got 283 degrees on the
hottest core
I mean fan noise didn't even get
unreasonable even that whiney looking
power supply fan was surprisingly well
behaved and didn't have any discernible
whiny motor noise and of course due to
go use of those high quality cougar fans
on the side panel the overall system
sounds like air whooshing as opposed to
motors whining so that is a very strong
result cooling wise now the Krait uses a
strong positive pressure concept to
control air flow and keep it in taking
in the back and then exhausting only out
the left and then of course a little bit
goes out from that active fan on the
power supply and this system works with
everything running full blast this vent
right here on the side in spite of the
fact that it doesn't have its own fans
feels like a space heater there's like
there's like air like coming out of it
like that I mean I suspect that by
reordan orienting the fans on the side
panel
you might be able to achieve slightly
better temperatures on one component or
another but I don't think it would have
the same overall effect that create
computers is going for of dispensing the
heat from the GPU with getting rid of it
immediately and pushing it out the side
panel rather than allowing it to affect
the other components in fact I believe
that that's a big part of why the CPU
temperatures only went up about 8
degrees from turning on fur mark at the
same time as prime95 so great thinking
on their part there so I've talked up
their cooling approach a fair
here but you know that's not really
enough torture let's torture it some
more
this time I want to go with a more
realistic use case scenario actual
gaming but to bring on the pain I'm
going to be overclocking the graphics
card so I fired up EVGA precision and
dialed in a quick and dirty overclock of
plus 200 megahertz on the core and plus
250 megahertz on the video ram I then
crank the maximum voltage and crank the
power limit and thermal limit to their
absolute maximums and fire it up Batman
Arkham origins
color me impressed with the game max
doubt it was playable which is great at
1080p but this isn't exactly news to
anyone who's ever seen GTX 780
benchmarks before more importantly the
GPU never went over 80s degrees even in
this scenario and sat between eleven
sixty megahertz and twelve hundred
megahertz a very healthy real-world
frequency for an air-cooled GTX 780 at
the best of times
never mind when it's in a tiny little
enclosure like this one alright Linus so
we get it
performance is a strong point but you
know what about the bad stuff well I
don't know guys I mean the stock cooler
on the CPU didn't impress me that much
although I plan to because it's very
modular and you can tinker around with
it if you want I plan to experiment with
removing the necessary side panel fans
to allow me enough clearance to put a
non-reference cooler on the CPU I think
other than that the system is pretty
much ideal but I mean being able to
achieve slightly better overall
performance by throwing a few more
gigahertz on the core couldn't be a bad
thing
ergonomics could probably use some
improvement in a generation to product
the base is solid and feels really good
and in my opinion actually has a like a
rugged industrial beauty to it but not
everyone will feel the same way about
not having tilt height adjust etc on
their monitor and not to mention
accessing the i/o on the bottom of the
system is not the easiest thing in the
world another thing I'd like to see
added to a generation 2 product would be
some front USB 3 on the side or maybe
monitor selections that include
to be freehub so that we have easy
access to that and then with a nice
little cable like they've done with the
DVI one pre connected that would be a
great way to deal with that um well I
guess the last thing I'd like to see a
better implementation of out of the box
is dynamic fan control for the case fans
the system is not unreasonably loud
especially under load where it's very
reasonable but at idle it could easily
be quieter with just one small tweak so
EVGA x' bios has a really cool smart fan
option that lets you set up a custom
curve for your cpu fan that is
controlled via PWM swift tech has a PWM
splitter that would be a low-cost way to
have all four case fans powered off the
power supply yet controlled by that one
PWM signal so that would be a great way
to handle them that other than that it's
a cool innovative product and I'm really
excited to see more it's basically a
clean non blower infected customizable
and upgradeable boutique system that is
small enough to fit on your desk in the
same space as just a monitor so you can
check out crate computers as
configurator in the link below the video
and it would I would definitely
recommend that you do they're not the
cheapest systems in the world and
they're not perfect but if you are
looking for the answer to what is the
smallest footprint into which I can fit
a full powered gaming rig on my desk
this is the best answer that I have yet
encountered thanks for watching guys
like the video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it leave a comment
and let me know I think I asked for a
comment earlier in the video with
something to do with let me know what
you think about you know who would need
an all-in-one and as always don't forget
