aluminum stand for your smartphone that
even holds tablets up to eight inches
click now to learn more welcome to the
first in a series of desktop speaker
reviews I've been at work on these for
quite some time and your feedback is
welcome on how we can continue to
improve them so first up is the very
famous and a very sexy Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins
n M ones starting off we've got the i/o
they've got an integrated DAC which
means they'll run off a single mini USB
connector to your PC or Mac but if you
prefer you can also use a
three-and-a-half millimeter analog
connector which will override the other
audio source the left speaker connects
to the right via a hardwired cable that
then plugs in to the bottom of the back
of the right and routes through the
rubber base of the speaker detachable
would have been better for me on this
side but I guess it's not that big of a
deal you would never run the left
speaker by itself each speaker has a
premium feeling cloth material covering
the business stuff aluminum accents and
clearly imprinted R and L indicators to
show which speaker goes where with
simple Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins branding and a
grippy rubber base that isn't going to
go anywhere there is no doubt that their
stylish I actually didn't appreciate how
great they look until I set them up I'm
doing all of my listening tests on my
XPS 12 two and one altra book and then
when you combine one sexy minimalistic
piece of hardware with another one it
gives you a much better appreciation for
the thought that went into the design of
these things with style out of the way
though I don't feel organ onyx are a
very strong point the right speaker
contains the DAC amp
and controls but while I appreciate its
simplicity and clean looks I feel like
some of the functionality is compromised
I mean the headphone port is actually
behind the speaker on the back and the
power button which also serves as a mute
button and volume control while being
sexy and built into the aluminum strip
that goes around when you push on the
sides you actually physically move the
speaker so I found that you'll pretty
much have to use be fortunately included
handy dandy remote if you're making any
changes to you know
volume or power or actually you can
change tracks and stuff on it as well so
that's a fairly nice inclusion now
getting into the listening tests a
maximum volume is a weak point of the mm
one's cranking them past around 70 to 75
percent volume on my PC tanks the sound
quality I mean it's not crackling or
some other kind of obvious distortion
and I'm not sure if it's a power limiter
or something else but the mids seem to
completely disappear and the effect
actually persists if you quickly lower
the volume to a more reasonable level it
takes a few seconds to recover and then
they sound good again they're fine for
sitting at your PC listening to music
while getting some work done but if
you're expecting to bother your
neighbors with them then you better
sneak into their house tape the emam
ones to their unsuspecting heads and
then start rocking out if you want it to
have that sort of effect more listening
tests where I really felt like these
Shawn for me was their stereo and a Jing
when listening to music coming into this
series of reviews my experience has been
with mostly computer speakers notably
the clips for me to ultra five-point
ones Razer Makos of course are SP 2500
and I've just never been able to figure
out what the heck people are talking
about when they're like oh yeah the
singers voice should sound like it's
coming out of an imaginary center
Channel
well now I know they perform incredibly
well in that way and it really surprised
me that I was getting a sound like that
out of something this small
speaking of sounds out of something this
small the bass performance of the mm
once actually surprised me as well it
does feel a bit one-dimensional as if a
lot of engineering went into reproducing
a limited I'll be it well controlled and
punchy range of lower frequency sound
but that they just couldn't do more than
that due to the size and design
constraints I mean this was expected
though size Trump's all when it comes to
making big sounds and low frequency
sounds but it just ended up being
disappointing sometimes because the
highs sounds so clean and detailed that
in quieter parts of the track as it
builds towards a crescendo yet when the
hair start to rise on the back ear neck
and you're expecting a wave of immersion
in the music and then they fall short in
that way it's like a sneeze that's
coming and doesn't I mean I don't
my news excels less full than I'm used
to hearing it and forget about action
games and movies there's simply no
Rumble to them so I guess this negative
point it is a negative point but could
also be seen as a positive point though
I mean I'm criticizing a product for
being dramatically better than I
expected in one area which drew my
attention to its shortcomings in another
where it would have been physically
impossible for it to really be much
better so it might be unfair but it just
doesn't change the listening experience
other than the aforementioned power
limiter issue mids and highs performed
very well and at reasonable levels they
really do sound great with a wide
variety of different music highs in
particular again we're just playing
clearer and more accurate sounding than
anything else in my upcoming review
series female vocalists just sing
through these I mean you know they're
singing but but they sound a really good
as my point males do get lost a little
bit by comparison and if you want to get
the most out of your rap collection and
you might want to grab some bones
companion fives instead but that doesn't
change that the mm one's really
surprised me all right so we're getting
close to the end now but before I get
into the conclusion I do want to address
something I've seen many comments about
in user reviews of these speakers earth
to the people buying these yes the right
speaker gets warm on the top and it's
okay who cares I mean what are you doing
licking it it is smart design to use a
stylish aluminum construction as a
heatsink and that's all they're doing
here there's an amp in there so anyway
there are much more valid complaints to
make about the mmm ones the most
important of which are they're dated
feature set and that bizarre power
limiter feature that limits them to
about 75 percent volume so I think the
real conclusion for this product comes
down to how you're going to listen to
them whether they live in an apartment
or not some people don't itch to turn
the volume knob clockwise some people
want what looks good next to their
MacBook and will pay handsomely for
something that does and if it also
performs pretty well then great but
while I understand I'm not the target
customer for the MM ones and dropping
500 dollars on something that doesn't
have a subwoofer in the name of getting
something that delivers accurate well
balanced sound very little cable clutter
and admit
beautiful ID and a super tiny
form-factor is just not my thing I do
see why someone would want the mmm ones
and actually be very happy with them for
those folks I will say this though the
simple audio listens are also worth a
look they are bigger and subjectively
not as good looking but they performed
similarly in the mid-range deliver
stronger and more detailed bass and
while they and everything else in this
roundup lack the same crystal clear
detail in the highs
they sound fuller though much louder
without strange behavior and are a more
modern design with their touch sensitive
controls and built-in Bluetooth
connectivity with that out of the way
there are other combinations that be
bang for the buck crowd will be
interested in for about $500 compared to
either of those two but I'm going to
make you stay tuned for the rest of the
series if you want all of the answers
speaking of the bang for the buck crowd
we have a new sponsor in this cookie jar
sound effects Hulu Plus hooked me up
there that was my joke Hulu Plus hooked
me up with an extended trial normally
it's only one week and I get to give you
guys one to head over to Hulu Plus comm
slash Linus or click the link in the
video description and you can try it out
for two weeks make sure to get the plus
part in there unlike regular hulu hulu
plus is available on devices like phones
game consoles and streaming boxes and
gives you access to tons of wicked
content we've got current seasons of
kids shows like Shark Tank the vampire
diaries and Sleepy Hollow and back
catalogs of your favorite shows like
Doctor Who South Park and American Dad
okay those are my favorite shows not
yours and admittedly those first three
weren't kids shows but it's not like I
see you making a list and sending it to
me why are you people so critical I'm
trying to do something here anyway you
can watch stuff you're familiar with
already or check out exclusive originals
like deadbeat a comedy about a pot
smoker who talks to ghosts which is
available starting April 9th I haven't
watched it yet though obviously unless I
could film this in the future and come
back and release it now or did I but
anyway I think the bottom line is at
7.99 cents per month it is a lot less
expensive than all the Doctor Who swag
