it's the Holy Grail but it takes a few
special ingredients to make it work
bringing your computer into the living
room well that's easy enough and these
days there are plenty of powerful small
form-factor machines that look perfectly
at home in your entertainment unit then
there's the wireless controls well
fortunately cordless peripherals have
made huge performance and battery gains
in recent years and now they fit nicely
inside these cushioned lap boards sorry
couch wood and then finally there's the
TV which is probably 4k and definitely
bigger than your gaming monitor but
usually only 60 Hertz and bound to
suffer from dog slow input lag so yeah
the TV is basically always the weakest
link when it comes to living room PC
gaming setups or is it this right here
is the HP omen X Imperium 65 the first
production BFG D or big format gaming
display to reach our studio but could it
possibly be worth the diaper filling
price of $5,000
the lien Li 0 1 1 D has just been given
a facelift by Razer now compatible with
Razer chroma devices it also comes with
customizable underglow powered by Razer
synapse 3 click the link below to get a
chance to win one for yourself if you
found yourself salivating over our
review of the 4k 144 Hertz
Asus PG 27 UQ gaming monitor last summer
then the TLDR is this this puppy here is
just about as ballin as that $2,000
panty butter was but at over four times
the surface area it's pretty much the TV
we have always wanted like I am already
trying to figure out how to get this
video done as quickly as I possibly can
so that I can just take it home and play
games on it by myself
in a dark room for all time why you
might ask
well because the Imperium 65 like all
BFG DS right now is guaranteed to have a
laundry list of vital stats including 4k
resolution g-sync ultimate which means
not only g-sync but also HD are a 120
Hertz native refresh rate ultra low
input lag and as a total bonus a
built-in Nvidia shield TV I mean I
already have one of those but like hey
values value and those things are worth
like 180 bucks on their own so then
let's go through each of these points in
finer detail starting with appropriately
resolution its 3840 by 2160 UHD so you
can get inside of 2 feet from this thing
before you start seeing the individual
pixels now it's thick by modern TV
standards but that's for good reason it
uses a direct rather than Edge LED
backlight with full array local dimming
across 384 zones which means they're
just under 5 square inches each and they
managed to sustain brightness on this
thing of 715 it's with peak brightness
of 1000 nits earning this puppy the
display HDR 1000 certification
along with that of course comes great
colors so it's an 8-bit plus FRC panel
but in our tests it achieved over 94% of
the DCI p3 color space and it's got
professional-grade color accuracy right
out of the box also while they are by no
means OLED level the blacks are pretty
deep because it uses a VA panel so if
you have black bars on your content it's
not nearly as distracting as it might be
on an IPS type display with that said
for strictly movie watching the Imperium
65 was never gonna be a great value so
let's talk gaming now this is far from
the only TV with a 120 Hertz refresh
rate but the difference is that it's
real like the actual screen refreshes at
full 4k resolution 120 times per second
no dropping down to 1080p no frame
interpolation BS and it can actually
even be overclocked to 144 Hertz by
exposing the option through the
on-screen display we were able to get a
stable overclock with no problems and
the experience is just buttery smooth
it's got all the modern g-sync features
like support for windowed mode and fast
sync vsync and no sync options for if
you somehow get FPS higher than the
displays maximum refresh rate which
would take some serious hardware at 4k
residential TV though is something that
you won't find on the spec sheet input
leg that little delay between moving the
mouse and seeing the action on the
screen now there are plenty of TVs out
there with input lag around the 50 60 or
even 70 milliseconds pretty bad since 30
milliseconds is what would be considered
noticeable as for this unit honestly it
feels like a gaming monitor now we
measured lag times of about 30 to 35
milliseconds but keep in mind that our
matter of mesh
now measures the delay of the entire
chain from mouse to PC to game engine to
display electronics to pixel response
times so the display lag is lower than
our measurements show now we do have
some tools on the way that should help
us get more accurate results and I plan
on doing a follow-up video or actually
bring one of these puppies home and
decide for good what's going to live in
my living room but for now let me just
say it this way this TV feels responsive
AF but everything we've said so far is
gonna be the same for all of the Nvidia
BFG DS that are coming out what makes
HP's offering different to be frank not
a lot it's mostly just down to the
physical design which my opinion is kind
of a mixed bag one of my favorite things
about this display is the little light
bar that they put by the eye oh isn't
that awesome
you just wave your hands and it lights
up this might seem trivial but it can be
really hard to plug in a cable
especially with your TV mounted tightly
against the wall and like trying to hold
your phone as a flashlight in your mouth
rarely improves the situation speaking
of wall mounting this set is also
interesting because it comes with a
sound bar and offers two different ways
of standing it up the first way is to
attach these beefy matte black legs to
the TV and then according to the
frustratingly brief instructions just
kind of slide the sound bar underneath I
guess now it's kind of inconsequential
but this method felt kind of weird
because we weren't actually attaching
the sound bar to the TV even though they
come together in the box so then if you
want to do that then you use method
number two where you don't use the legs
and instead you mount these brackets to
the sound bar first and then everything
to the bottom of the display which by
the way takes forever because you can't
just lay the display down on the table
like the instructions say because the
bloody sound bar is thicker than the
display meaning that you will cross
thread the screws which you can barely
turn because the allen key doesn't fit
anyway look it doesn't matter we got it
done but if all that sounded like it's
not worth
then mission accomplished I guess
because don't set it up this way unless
you're going to wall mount it because
it's tippy to the point of being very
dangerous like this thing is puppy
crushingly heavy on the subject of wall
mounting though that works great and I
was very pleased to see a standard face
amount with no curvature and no nonsense
but don't expect to get that sexy flush
mount look because this TV as I alluded
to before is really thick and then again
the soundbar makes it jut out even more
than it absolutely has to yeah you know
what the soundbar overall it's just kind
of a contentious issue for me so on the
one hand it is nice that a $5,000 TV
comes with speakers that are at least
halfway decent though to be clear not
amazing but on the other hand I mean
isn't it fair to assume that most people
who are in the market for a $5,000
display also have money for decent
speakers so I guess that's a tidy
transition into the imperium 65 suite
points and the first one is a real
doozie screen uniformity the edges and
particularly the corners have this sepia
toned grandma's attic
almost dirty look to them when you're
looking at white or a bright background
now in fairness I wouldn't notice it in
a game where I'm typically pretty
focused on the crosshair right in front
of me but once you see it it's hard to
unsee it if you're doing something like
web browsing or really anything that's
light-colored also there's some pretty
noticeable vertical banding going on and
these things contributed to while using
it just this feeling of having bought an
oversized gaming monitor versus a
premium television and it gets worst one
of the biggest improvements to TVs in
the last few years has been there nearly
perfect off-axis viewing experience at
least to a degree pun intended
and the BFG D falls well short of what I
would consider to be acceptable for a
large living room viewing experience
where someone like even on a couch like
the one I'm sitting here on right now
someone is gonna end up either off on
the side or on a beanbag chair over
there and they are not gonna have as
good an experience both color and
contrast are affected but it's the
banding and the halos around bright
objects because of the local dimming
that are truly distracting now they get
better if you turn the local dimming off
but that's not what I want to do when
I'm gaming or watching a movie in HDR on
my $5,000 display and finally keep in
mind that like anything using
DisplayPort 1.4 running 4k at 144 Hertz
comes with the trade-off of chromophore
2 to subsampling rather than 4 for 4
which we discussed in more detail in our
PG 2 7uq review also the screen takes a
good 10 to 12 seconds to turn on whoof
and when it comes to HDR support the
imperium does not support Dolby vision
instead only offering HDR 10 which HP
somehow thinks can be appropriately
described as one of the most ambitious
HDR standards
okay in conclusion this display is
kick-ass and I really really want to
play what I want to play with it and
then and then clean it and tuck it in at
night and the thing is that I already
have it it's here an HP sent it to me to
review so then yeah if you're a
billionaire you should go get one right
now for your dedicated gaming salon but
I just have a harder time recommending
this to anyone for whom $5,000 is a
stretch and here are the reasons number
one while I've been referring to it as a
TV
it isn't strictly speaking a TV it's
actually missing some TV features like
for example a TV tuner I don't
personally consider that a big deal
because I don't remember when the last
time anyone used their TVs onboard tuner
was but it's an important enough a
distinction that HP sent us an irate
email because we kept calling it a TV
and they were like no it's a display so
fine I'm mentioning it there you go -
it's really tough to push Triple A games
past about 70 FPS at 4k and the thing is
if you're not going to game at either 4k
or 120 Hertz or more specifically both
of them then you might as well save
yourself some cash with a free sync 120
Hertz 1080p TV then perhaps most
importantly three within the next year
we're gonna see a lot of the gaming
features that make the imperium so great
start to appear in mainstream TVs since
with HDMI 2.1 are due out this year that
means 4k 120 Hertz and again with free
sync support so then as long as they
have low input lag and a fair number of
TVs out there do now they'll probably
offer up a very similar gaming
experience compared to the BFG D but
they could be as much as a few thousand
dollars cheaper
so this was an amazing product concept
that addressed a huge gap in the market
when Nvidia in Vail did at CES 2018 now
it is a bit of a tougher sell do you
ever wonder what your car is trying to
tell you when the check engine light
turns on well an obd2 scanner can help
but it can be complicated to use as it
can produce hard to decipher codes well
fixed offers you a better solution
overall with its included obd2 sensor
and smartphone app for Android or iOS
devices with their solution you can find
out what the specific code is trying to
tell you the consequences if you ignore
the problem when you do for maintenance
the estimated cost of repair and more
it's extremely easy to use and is
helpful no matter what your level of
vehicle knowledge is so use offer code
