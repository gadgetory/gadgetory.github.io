came about is actually a pretty good one
they're both probably dangerous
so today's video is gonna be me trying
to pairs of hover shoes which one will
be better the brand name or the knockoff
or will I ever even find out
speaking of finding out I just found out
that cable mods vertical PCI Express
bracket lets you securely mount your
graphics card vertically inside your
case it's gonna be about the only
securely mounted thing in this video I
think it includes a PCI Express riser
cable to display adapter cables and it's
compatible with most cases that's have
seven open PCI Express slots check it
out today at the link in the video
description so first order of business
was digging around and seeing if I could
find some protective gear to wear
unfortunately we got rid of I think all
the knee pads and elbow pads from nerd
sports but my old motorcycle helmet
which is expired so it's no longer
suitable for road use is here and I will
be wearing that yeah I mean if we had
pillows then no no we do we built a
bedroom set I can protect my precious
butt and that's the moneymaker right
there no no one watches these videos for
the tech knowledge it's all about the
butt oh yeah feel like my butt could
take a pounding now
I just want to see if we have any of the
old channel Superfund protective gear
okay more kneepads and we don't have any
elbow pads but we do have knee pads but
this is better than nothing so thanks I
do want to clarify something I'm not
some kind of you know electric personal
transportation device you know noob
oh I regularly still ride my Zboard
electrics keyboar keyboard from all of
my experience riding these types of
devices I have seen nothing that would
indicate to me that this is a good idea
least gonna put on a couple layers here
because I forgot to bring in my
motorcycle jacket safety first baby
which one you want to see brand name or
off-brand brand name first alright let's
do it
so this is the Segway drift w1 maybe the
drift is for how far they've drifted
from their position as the market leader
I have never ridden these and in fact
the first time I took them out of the
box
there was a glitched out issue with one
of them that was able to be resolved but
I have never ridden and I just kind of
put my foot on one of them so they don't
seem to really have like a forward and
backwards but the power buttons are
right over here and they double as
battery indicator and off to a good
start early my concern here is not
really balanced but how you keep from
kind of ending up with your legs like
this and having a hard time getting them
back together because these aren't
rollerblade very comfortable on
rollerblades really whoa whoa baby holy
crap oh I wish I was on ground that was
a little bit more level okay so we're
gonna go a little slow to start it's a
little trickier than I'm used to whoa so
once you start going on a standard
hoverboard it's only the first little
bit where you feel like kind of Lert see
where as these it's hard to feel
completely stable on them at least you
know this is my first time riding them I
do but I mean what do you want to see
David yeah I'm super down do we have
comes time to head inside whoa oh man
I'm good
hey that was that was a lot better
that was a mushy bump mind you ethernet
cable no problem power cable huh
I am not even gonna try that is this all
we got four cones I mean I guess that's
realistically that's probably enough
great doesn't really matter I gotta say
on a completely smooth floor it is a
little easier oh it's powered you look
at this and you go good yeah
well heck yeah I've been on this how
long 10 minutes my ankles are so sore
already let's set up this obstacle
course if I can pull off three turns
through it
we like time it or something call that
pretty good ok alright ok google' start
my stopwatch you suck so much stopwatch
is not yet supported
these are hover shoes sir yeah you lean
back or you lean forward no you're not
strapped in you just did that Segway
they're made by Segway yeah all right
you ready okay here's your timer
let's read seem reasonable okay because
you know I'm going max speed here right
max power
oh together shoe and time time oh
shoot one minute 27 on the Segway brand
alright let's try the off-brand now he's
getting away it's running away
hey okay what we're at the other Masco
some guys drove through here did he like
clip it and send it flying somewhere
it's just gone it's so bizarre okay
that's about the same yeah red battery
old boy do they immediately look cheaper
oh that's some quality plastic right
there one thing that I kind of
appreciate I guess is they've got a
ridge on the side so your foot can't
rotate too much I don't really get this
it's just like a carrying handle for me
hey wait wait I got a live one here
these ones have her on their own did you
have to get on them can't tell the
indicator LEDs not very bright hey there
we go okay son no so far functionally
they seem very similar the brakes work
it's a positive indicator you know what
I do want to test going in that door so
the other effect of harder wheels are
harder tires is that they're less
forgiving on bumps it's immediately
noticeable I want to try going over the
how did this get here
oh so sweaty all right see how this goes
it seems I mean acceptable I wouldn't
recommend it on Ivan from all right now
worst-case scenario is not a red battery
that gets run over at least so far the
biggest drawback is actually one that I
didn't really expect and it's hard
braking because it's hard to break
exactly evenly and then once you get
spread it's hard to bring it back
together you know oh all right hello max
speed here oh shoot
get out hit a rock Oh
cornering on these ones noticeably worse
gotta get around yeah one 19.7 baby
these ones definitely corner better and
absorb little bumps in the road and
mishaps better these ones
frankly I don't even know how much
either of them cost but these ones are
probably cheaper but they both cost too
much because these are really stupid if
the argument is that they're compact and
when you get to where you're going you
can you can throw them in your bag and
you can carry them around with you oh oh
maybe but you're you're reaching so hard
because they're really heavy these are
better than these but I wouldn't
recommend either of them I'm sure many
