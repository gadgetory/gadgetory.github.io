has been over a year and in that time
you've managed to build up a thousand
bucks that's burning a hole in your
pocket
maybe you've been grinding for Gil at
the local McDonald's working late at the
office or perhaps you've been up to some
slightly shady or stuff like trading
skins and csgo
but enough of your life story you're
wondering about the best way to turn
that cash that's my keys not my wallet
cash into a gaming computer and we've
got you covered
okay so it has been a while but I'm
pretty sure I remember all the stuff we
need screwdriver perfect pliers pliers a
pair of side cutters a magnetic parts
tray if you want to stay organized and
of course the anti-static strap that I
am always definitely actually wearing on
my ankle when we shoot these guides for
our CPU we've gone with the core i5 7500
this quad core hits a sweet spot in
Intel's lineup it boosts up to 3.8
gigahertz making it great not just for
gaming but also for productivity and
even like content creation and stepping
up to the i-5 7600 means paying 20% more
for only a nine and a half percent clock
speed increase something we wanted to
avoid for a value optimized build like
this one first things first
make a safe workspace out of the
motherboard box then line up the Golden
Triangle on the corner of the CPU with
the imprinted triangle on the CPU socket
cover then undo the retention arm by
pulling it away from the socket then
lifting carefully place the CPU on to
the LGA 1151 socket with no force give
it a little wiggle to ensure a snug fit
and finally replace the retention arm
the socket cover will pop off on its own
put that somewhere safe because you
might need it again in the future
our cooling choice was pretty
straightforward be quiet
sponsored this guide but seriously we
chose the dark rock 3 in particular
because it's over built for our CPU
keeping our finished system nearly
silent and it's going to look through
the window of the pure bass 600 case
that we found bundled with it for a
fantastic price to install we first
apply a rice sized blob of thermal
compound in the middle of the CPU then
flip the motherboard over and orient the
backplate so that these screw sticking
through are aligned with these cutouts
next place these weird shaped screws
through the holes on the backplate flip
the motherboard back over and slide
these little C shaped plastic clips onto
the bottom of each post next you'll need
to screw on this piece holding it in
place on the front while you screw it in
from the back and then you'll need to
secure the hold down brackets to the
base of the heatsink using the included
m3 screws at this stage you might need
to reapply any thermal compound that you
accidentally wiped off while you were
flipping the motherboard around and
you'll want to remove the sticker from
the base of the heatsink leaving this on
would be a big problem
finally align the heatsink with the
screws such that the fan will be blowing
towards the back of the case and
carefully lower the heatsink onto the
motherboard kind of like so this last
part is a little bit tricky but you need
to thread this nut onto this little stud
and then tighten up the screws from the
back the cherry on top is cable managing
the CPU fan connector and plugging it
into the four pin CPU fan header on the
motherboard buying memory for a budget
build like this one is pretty
straightforward
just choose whatever dual channel ddr3
Mizan sale at the time you're building
it from a reputable brand like Corsair
if you have a windowed case like we do
then choose whatever sexy Ram is on sale
at the time this 16 gig of vengence lpx
ddr4 2400 should be more than enough for
the next couple of years and it features
a low profile heat spreader design for
optimal compatibility for installation
pull back the tabs on the end of the RAM
slots then when you realize you've got a
bit of a clearance issue refocus your
attention on the heatsink just remove
the wires on the fan move it up a little
bit
it and put them right back into place
then line up the notch in the RAM with
the little knobby in the slot then put
the RAM gently in place and give it a
little push on both ends until the tab
pops back into position rinse and repeat
for the number of dims you have making
sure that matching pairs go into the
same color slots the rationale for the
case besides of course be quiet
sponsoring this video is that for $100
it's a darn good deal featuring two pure
Wings fans built-in fan speed control
and grommets for easy cable management
oh and most importantly there is the
super sexy tempered glass window
I mean it's 2017 baby and tempered glass
always puts a smile on my face
we chose the asus be 150 plus
motherboard mostly because of its low
cost it's not a high-end product and
lacks what we would consider to be some
fairly basic features such as
overclocking support a heatsink for the
power delivery and even an HDMI or
DisplayPort output but it's got USB
type-c and solid upgradability with
support for AMD crossfire nvme m dot 2
SSDs up to seven total expansion cards
as long as a few of them are PCI and our
CPU isn't overclockable anyway so the
first step as much as I love seeing my
reflection in the glass is to remove the
side panel and put it somewhere safe
where it won't get knocked over and
break make sure you keep all the screws
in a parts tray or some other location
where they can't be knocked away we
couldn't figure out how to make
installing an i/o shield interesting so
put it in from the back like so and add
fire make sure it snapped into place
next holding the motherboard by the CPU
heatsink place it into the case and then
tighten the six screws here
here here and here or actually one
benefit of this case is that you only
have to put in five since the center of
the board is held in by a little nubbin
now it's time to plug in the front panel
connectors HD audio plugs in here
so does USB 3 and then next is the front
panel connectors which go in a little
like so the positive ends are on the
left for our power supply we went with
the be quiet pure power 10 600 watt it's
80 plus silver efficiency and high
output capacity mean that it will run
cool and quiet with room for future
expansion it's also semi modular and
painted black to match the inside of our
case which is critical of course in the
tempered glass era inside the power
supply box you'll find all the modular
cables you'll need we grabbed one with
three SATA connectors and another with
PCI Express as well as some cable ties
and five screws up conveniently be quiet
includes an extra in case you
accidentally drop one place the power
supply into the case with the fan on the
bottom side so it isn't drawing in hot
air from the GPU then screw in the four
screws on the back and run your power
supply cables through the cable
management grommet moving around to the
back we run them back through the
grommets to the other side where they
need to go and plug in the eight pin and
24-pin power connectors for the
motherboard PCIe power stays hanging
there for now and so does our SATA power
for graphics we chose the AMD our X 480
in our case the XFX flavor
sometimes this particular card is more
expensive though so what we'd really
recommend is choosing whatever brand is
on sale at the moment like right now for
instance at the time of recording this
this gigabyte card is on sale the RX 480
is a great choice for 1080p gaming as
we'll demonstrate in our system
benchmarks later on undo the two screws
on the PCI covers here and here place in
the video
card making sure that the PCIe lock at
the back end gauges then replace the two
screws you removed before and plug in
the eight pin PCI Express power
connector it really is that simple its
2017 and in our minds then an SSD boot
drive is every bit as essential as a
tempered glass side panel these days so
we went with the Kingston SSDs
that gives us enough room for the
operating system and a handful of
programs and games for overflow storage
we also threw in a cheap WD blue one
terabyte though it should be noted you
could easily increase the capacity
simply by picking a bigger drive first
we need to plug our SATA cables into the
motherboard and pass them through the
cable management grommets around back
remove the SSD mounting bracket insert
these four screws and reinstall the SSD
into the case for the hard drive the
mounting bracket can be removed with
these three thumb screws on the back
here then you slide the hard drive in
and secure it with the included space
screws connect your SATA power cable to
your hard drive then realize that it
won't quite reach the SSD so move that
bad boy over one slot then plug in the
included fan controller and bask in the
glory of your victory
there will be no walk of shame back to
the power supply box for another modular
cable today though that won't save you
from removing and reinstalling the hard
drive when you realize that it's ruining
the black and orange aesthetic of your
build
now before reinstalling the side panel
connect your keyboard mouse and monitor
then boot up the system and press Delete
or f2 to get into the UEFI BIOS for your
motherboard enable XMP to make sure your
ram is running at its rated speed of
2400 megahertz
then ensure that your USB Drive that
you'll have had to prepare before to be
a Windows install bootable Drive is
recognized and restart the system once
you're into the Windows setup it's
basically just click Next until Windows
is installed and you land at the desktop
the latest drivers can be found on the
manufacturer websites for a soos Intel
and AMD and this is also a good time to
hit up ninite.com to pick up your
favorite free applications and a nice
easy to use package now it's finally
time for some finishing touches like
cable management which actually isn't a
lot of work in this case pun intended
and then we're pretty much good to go
the system is assembled and we can just
ah who are we kidding
it's time for some RGB pizzazz we used
up the final three dollars of our budget
on this USB mood lighting past it into
the case through a PCI bracket and then
for good measure lit the case on fire
because like we said before it's 2017
and no computer is complete without
pyrotechnics or something to that effect
but in all seriousness assembled this
thing looks pretty darn good compared to
a couple of years ago nice-to-haves like
rubber grommets easy cable management
and of course that all-important glass
window have become much more affordable
and performance while not mind-blowing
compared to some of the over-the-top
stuff we've done on this channel will
allow for solid gameplay and triple-a
titles while staying quiet and cool so
if you're looking for a moderately
budget oriented build that will handle
1080p gaming at 60fps in heavy triple-a
titles and over a hundred and twenty in
esports games this thing will be perfect
