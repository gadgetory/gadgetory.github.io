500 plus dollar TN panel displays as if
they were a golden gift from the PC gods
just because they were 4k I mean they
had solid response times with single
tile displays with some even delivering
8-bit panels decent viewing angles and
acceptable color reproduction
considering they were tan panels and you
know what I guess they were a gift
because at that time 4k monitors with
sharp eggs Oh panels we're going for
multiple thousands of dollars but the
story is different today and the VP 2784
K is a perfect showcase piece for
everything that's great about the onward
march of modern technology it's built
better and performs better than what you
could buy a short year ago without
costing relative to what you're getting
for your money that much more and on the
subject of not costing that much more
it's time to drop a solid hint about the
next episode of scrapyard bores it's
coming sometime in the next month and
our guest competitor will be Austin
Evans and I guess that's pretty much all
the hints but drop a like and let us
know if you're stoked to see it
the Logitech G 303 features a
lightweight design and advanced optical
sensor with delta0 technology for
precise tracking and RGB lighting to
match your setup click now to learn more
or check out the link in the video
description the betterness of this
monitor begins with the panel specs
it's 27 inches which is still the right
size for me for a 16 by 9 monitor about
the same vertical height as a 34 inch
ultra wide it features a w LED backlit
8-bit h IPS panel with advanced frame
rate control to achieve virtual 10 bit
performance something that you are
almost guaranteed to not be utilizing
thanks to poor hardware and application
support but might make you feel good
about your desk mounted EP and extension
the backlight uses DC brightness control
and is therefore flicker free something
which manufacturers are keen on pointing
out is less fatiguing on the eyes
viewing angles are outstanding with just
a little bit of contrast shift
vertically but nothing noticeable from
reasonable viewing angles the backlight
didn't exhibit excessive bleed and the
anti-glare coating on the screen is
pleasingly light and it doesn't make
everything behind it
hazy but does significantly reduce
reflections and I also said it's built
better what did I mean by that great
question the industrial design is
nothing special and screams I belong in
an office but that's not necessarily a
bad thing in my book there's something
to be said for practical design the VP
2784 K features a standard vase amount
thumbs up there if you want to put it on
a third party mount but this might not
be a big deal because it also features a
wide solidly built base with most of the
ergonomic adjustments that anyone would
want including height adjust tilt swivel
and even pivot for the portrait mode
fans out there since we've got it on its
side let's have a look at the IO there's
a 2 port USB 3 5 gigabit per second hub
then wow that's a lot of HDMI ports Wow
but there's actually more to them than
meets the eye one of them is HDMI 2.0
and we verified that it was no problem
to run Ultra HD resolution at 60 Hertz
over HDMI is nice very nice
two of the other ones are MHL 2.0 which
means that you could hook up your MHL
compatible phone to them if you wanted
to do that for some reason DisplayPort
1.2 and mini DisplayPort 1.2 are also
included which means pretty much any
modern desktop or laptop can be plugged
in and easily switched between or set up
in picture in picture or picture by
picture viewing mode with up to four
simultaneous inputs possible in the four
corners of the monitor but that's a
pretty fringe use case scenario and
unfortunately you'll have to contend
with the on-screen menu to set it up if
everything about this monitor was
amazing and actually it's like pretty
darn good I really liked it I still
wouldn't be able to say the on-screen
menu was anything but wretched they're
poorly labeled two is confirm and one is
back for some inexplicable reason ten
points from Gryffindor it uses touch
sensitive buttons with no tactile feel
whatsoever a hundred points from
Gryffindor and the tactile buttons only
register about 65 percent of the time
five hundred points from Gryffindor
excuse me view sonics I say Gryffindor
all those times but like I said
everything else about it is pretty darn
good out of the box I mean maybe it's
just my luck but even factory calibrated
display has always been a little off for
me
the VP 2780 was a little bit off white
point was about seven percent off she
achieved about 96 percent of the claimed
100% sRGB color space and brightness was
cranked up pretty high but to be clear
what you're looking at is not bad
performance and brightness can easily be
adjusted without really affecting
anything else and after a run with the
i1 Pro I would consider this puppy a
very capable and affordable monitor for
prosumer and even professional photo and
video work by the way thanks to spectra
Cal and x-ray for hooking us up with the
hardware and software that we used for
those performance measurements but let's
change gears a little bit it always
amuses me when companies seem to just
plain not be able to decide what
segments of the market their product is
for and they'll have liked this
presentation deck that looks like this
and it's like oh well this monitor is
great for abacus um everything and then
the
there's usually like gaming randomly
tacked on to the end of the list like
yeah well gamers have money right let's
gets good for them but in this case I
actually kind of buy it with an
impressive total input lag of about 10
milliseconds this 4k display will not be
holding you back as long as you're not
competing on the professional level in
which case you probably aren't using a
4k display anyway and as much as I can
rag on viewsonic for advertising and
out-of-the-box delta-e of less than two
which is I mean obviously didn't quite
achieve what I will say about the
default native setup that it ships with
is that it has a very pleasing look to
the eye and that for gaming use I would
actually have no desire to change it to
a more accurate color profile it pops
just right without having that way
over-the-top saturation and contrast
thing that you'd find on any monitor on
a shelf at Best Buy which leaves the
final words to attract the pure gamer
crowd I need to see support for an
adaptive refresh rate technology of some
sort free sync orgy sync but the VP 2784
Kay sells itself admirably to the semi
pro content creator who games on the
side with its great panel performance
and solid build quality speaking of
solid build quality I fix its toolkits
you may know I fix it from there tear
downs and repair guides of a variety of
electronic devices but what you might
not know is they actually have a ton of
fantastic tools available including the
Pro Tech tool kit
it's got 70 tools in there to assist you
with any mod malfunction or misfortune
it includes the 54 bit driver kit which
I use all the time it's got like
pentalobe bits and security bits and tri
wing bits and triangle bits I've never
even seen a triangle bit but if I did my
eye fix-it kit would take care of it
just fine it's got an esd-safe bunch of
like prying tools and tweezers and all
kinds of great stuff for working on
really little projects and anti-static
wrist strap
spud Jers in both nylon and metal all
kinds of great stuff and it's only 64 95
and backed by a lifetime warranty and on
top of that if
you guys use offer code LTTE for the
next limited period of time you can save
10 bucks on a purchase of $50 or more
over at ifixit.com slash Lynas which is
linked in the video description so head
over there get your protec toolkit
