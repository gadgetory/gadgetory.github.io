the HTC One S so this is positioned
slightly below the One X in terms of
HTC's product stack which means that you
find a slightly different array of
features so one notable thing that's not
on this phone is NFC however it does
have a lot going for it so it's using
and it's a Snapdragon s4 crate plus core
yes thank you plus it doesn't help when
there's pro and plus and play I mean
couldn't have just gone with like good
better and like awesomest or something
like that no no Pro Plus and play
so unlike the Droid DNA which we've also
had a look at recently it does not have
the super high-end chipset but this
should translate to better battery life
as well as really not that much of a
reduction in performance it's running an
Adreno 225 GPU which is sort of like a
like a souped-up 220 on a lower
manufacturing manufacturing note so the
performance of it even though it's not a
current generation Adreno 306 is
actually better than something like an
Adreno 305 which is a newer generation
but actually lower end chipset the
resolution of the screen it is an amo
LED screen which should help you in
terms of power consumption as well as in
terms of black levels so we're gonna go
ahead and just power it up really quick
here so remember guys amo LED means the
actual pixels themselves on the phone
are emitting light rather than relying
on a backlight with an LCD overlay over
the top so it's a 960 by 540 resolution
which is sort of coined the term is a
540 P so or qHD or whatever you wanted
to call it so it's a 16 by 9 aspect
ratio that is 1/4 the resolution of
1080p ok so it's not quite 720p but it
should still look pretty darn good on a
4.3 inch screen one of the other things
they're including and I can't remember
for the life of me what they call it
anymore but is there sort of better
picture taking quality concept so that
is an F 2.0 aperture lens which
basically amounts to more light being
allowed into the lens now guys when it
comes to
taking pictures it's physics so there's
your sensor size that assists and having
more light hit it
there's your lens quality your lens size
that gathers more light because when it
comes to low-light performance you can
only do so many fancy digital tricks
before it's just like okay well no we
actually just need more light we need
more data so having a clearer lens is
one of the things that can help with
light transmission through the glass to
the sensor itself and give you a better
quality image it's an eight megapixel
rear camera with a built in flash and
one of the other things you'll notice
about the back of the phone is it has
their Beats Audio branding so this
pretty much amounts to an equalizer
setting that I personally didn't mind
enhanced my listening experience however
compared to the iPhone 4 that I used for
two years I guess it's not like the
sound quality without beats enabled it's
a software feature so you can just turn
it off was any worse so they're using a
good quality audio chipset on it it's
just that I don't personally get any
benefit from the beats EQ setting so you
can see right here that this is not a
stock Android layout so there it's using
HTC's Sense 4.0 plus or i think that's
what it's called something along those
lines and they apparently want a SIM
card in oh look at that they include
little instructions for how to insert
your SIM card so you take this piece off
apparently all right nope this one you
know what give me a minute
ah yes right here so you peel this guy
up and just like that come on
you can do it go align us and that was
when you broke it
nope didn't break it there you go so SIM
card goes right there and then you can
also see there's some other stuff in
here that presumably you wouldn't need
to use for anything so we're gonna go
ahead and put that back on there you go
also on the top you find your lock
button as well as your headphone jack so
that's your power and lock button rather
on the side you find a volume rocker and
then on the other side you find oh cool
is that is that mini HDMI no USB I'm
sorry I didn't look that closely at it
so that's a USB connector so they've
opted for a side mounted charging
connector which
something that I haven't seen as often
as the more traditional bottom mounted
charging connector so image chip that's
actually part of their whole sort of
better camera concept so it's supposed
to have a one-second start up while that
was actually definitely less than a one
second so it says unable to use the
flash because the battery's too low
right now but there you go how quickly
can we take pictures focus shoot focus
shoot hopefully you can see this I don't
know if you can I think I might just
totally be standing in the way so in
terms of the pictures we're taking I
think I think got a rotates off clarity
wise it looks Wow actually really good I
guess it's about what you'd expect when
we're using studio lighting so let's
move into some size comparisons how big
is it it's a 4.3 inch screen so I think
I mentioned that before but how does it
actually compare to something else so
here is a Galaxy Note 2 so that's what
it looks like compared to one of those
all right here is an iPhone 4 so that's
a significantly smaller screen size okay
moving right along here is another HTC
phone so this is an 8s dismiss dismiss
go away there we go
that's an 8's so that's only a 4-inch
screen so it actually doesn't make that
much of a difference going from 4 to 4.3
but here we go
in terms of the size of the phone but it
does make the images look a little bit
bigger this is also a 4.3 inch screen
but a larger phone design on the HTC 8x
so you can see it's a little bit longer
on the bottom one thing that I actually
did not realize is that that little USB
connector I showed you guys can be used
for HDMI so that's why I thought it
looked kind of weird but with a special
cable you can use it as an HDMI output
which I personally think is very freakin
cool so they're saying that it comes
with Ice Cream Sandwich but it's jelly
bean is going to be either rolling out
or is rolling out right now according to
the information that we found so it's up
to date as far as Android operating
systems go I don't think I've shown you
guys what the phone looks like in any
more detail so this piece right here on
the back is actually metal and has a
very nice feel to it the piece on the
bottom here is rubberized and then the
piece on the top here feels more like I
don't know if it's rubber but it's soft
anyway so this feels more like a soft
touch finish up here as well I like this
because the way that I hold a phone is
I'll tend to support it with my pinkie
so that I can reach the entire keyboard
because I have the kind of smaller hands
so having this not be a slick metal
piece here actually is beneficial to to
certain people in terms of included
accessories there's not a whole lot
you've got a wall wart so there's your
little HTC this should be a 1 amp yep
HTC One and wall wart as well as a
microUSB cable for charging you also get
a little QuickStart guide that shows you
where all of the stuff on your phone is
that's the touch screen yay oh one of
the other details of the touch screen
that I wanted to cover again a moe LED
so super dark super deep blacks and then
check this out viewing angle should be
pretty much perfect with no distortion
regardless of how you're looking at it
can you see that Diesel yeah we got it
now so absolutely gorgeous I don't think
I mentioned yet that the CPU is clocked
at 1.7 gigahertz and it has 16 Meg at 16
Meg's yeah only 16 Meg's internal
storage don't worry about it store
everything in the cloud data is free
anyway haha 16 gigs internal storage
unfortunately this particular phone
can't be expanded with micro sd but
given that you actually can't install
apps off micro sd it's up to the
individual user whether that's an actual
detriment or not personally I never used
all 16 gigs on my iPhone 4 in two years
so I'm not a power user when it comes to
storage space but if you are then that
might be a bit of a problem for you I
think that pretty much wraps it up I
don't think I missed anything here and
thank you for checking out this unboxing
and first look at the HTC One S so that
is the step down from the 1x don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
for more unboxings reviews and other
computer videos I don't think I
mentioned this already but the 1080p
video that it records is actually at
30fps
so just for for lulz I'm gonna record
some video here maybe we'll catch our
production crew hello so you guys can
watch that video actually here we'll
watch that video on the
on the good one play oh I think I have
auto-rotate off we'll be back all right
so here's our video playback now that
I've enabled that there we go I have
noticed already that it's smoother than
the than the 1080p 30fps video that I
was recording on my 8x you can see it
adjusts for the lights behind slick
pretty well right there I don't think I
mentioned before that it has one gig of
ram I don't think we're even on blue not
even on full screen brightness yet there
we go okay well I think that wraps it up
