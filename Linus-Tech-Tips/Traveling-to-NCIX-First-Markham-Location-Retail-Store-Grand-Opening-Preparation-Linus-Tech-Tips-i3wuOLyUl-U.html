and I'm on my way to the airport I
unlocked the car before but apparently
it didn't work so putting my bag in your
trunk will perhaps have to wait until
after excellent so I'm just taking my
one bag it's gonna be in Toronto for
four days for the grand opening and I
hope that I will see at least some of
you there otherwise it'll be a bit of a
wasted trip
so that's part one of the saga going to
Markham on my way to Canada departures
at yvr Airport
right now we're at
so here I am in our new store first
Markham place so this is ironically our
first place in Markham if I place you
mean retail so we're still doing a lot
of work as you can see we've got like
sky Jack's inside and they're fixing
things up top we've got pallets of
product on there so you can see one of
the things they're working on right now
we have several professional unboxers
here working on taking out monitors and
getting them all set up so hopefully
you'll be able to come check us out when
we open up on Saturday and I'll keep
updating with my video blog as things
progress</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
