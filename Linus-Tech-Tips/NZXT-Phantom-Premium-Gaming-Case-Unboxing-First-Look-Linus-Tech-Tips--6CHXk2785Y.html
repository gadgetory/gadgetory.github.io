endless requests to unbox and do a first
look video first impressions video of
this case it is NZXT t's most probably
most anticipated case ever so the first
thing we're gonna do is break the seals
now this is an evaluation unit so it's
not white the fit and finish of the
product that's actually going to be
available on retail shelves so like it's
mostly done but there's a couple little
things like you might find the side
panel doesn't fit quite right
etc etc so the tooling is not quite
there yet but let's take a quick look at
the outside of the box before we
actually open it I know everyone's very
excited to see this thing here we go so
we have external 5 in the quarter inch
base 5 we have 7 internal three and a
half inch bays and then we have a
standard ATX seven expansion slots on
the top we have a 140 millimeter spot on
the top oh sorry in the front we have a
140 millimeter spot in the top we have 2
by 200 millimeter with one included in
the rear we have one 120 millimeter
included and on the side we have one 200
or 230 millimeter and to 120 millimeters
and those are included ok clearance we
can accept up to 35 centimeter long
video card so that's quite long that's
like what thirteen and a half inches or
something like that anything out there
basically CPU support is 180 millimeters
assuming you're not using the side fin
and that pretty much takes care of
everything here it's available in red
black and white but black and white are
the only colors that are going to be
available right off the bat in terms of
the other features Apple room for wire
management that's one of the things
that's got people really talking about
this case as well as the e-atx support
it has a nice roomy interior so you can
actually see it right here it looks kind
of like stormtrooper armor actually it's
a pretty pretty cool color scheme with
mostly white and then black accents very
it also includes okay you got the seven
cooling fans with the option of up to
three large 200 mil fans and this is
cool because this really ties in to how
they've got the two hundred millimeter
fan holes in the case you can support up
to five 20 watt channel fans on the
controller you have a fan controller
that supports up to 20 watt fans per
channel so that's very very cool because
it means you can support big fans fans
that move a lot of air and you can
actually do it with the fan controller
that's built right into the case
here's a pictures of the two other
colors so the one we have here today I
believe is white seven hard drive screw
this rails with SSD support and
screwless five and a quarter inch design
so mostly to lift but we'll have a look
at the case itself very shortly here and
we'll we'll definitely talk in more
detail about all the innovations found
within packaging is really good this is
so important because unless you're
buying the case at a retail store which
I hope you're not because you should be
buying it at NCIX
it's important that the case actually
survives its trip to you so NZXT has
ample foam packaging built in around the
case you can see they've got it molded
to the shape of the top of the case
itself here it looks really really good
this is a nice sturdy closed cell foam
very very important for ensuring that
your case is going to arrive in one
piece
same thing for the bottom very nice all
custom fitted if you surprised how few
cases come adequately packed because
while it may be enough for the case to
ship on its own what if you ever have to
ship a full system built in the case it
becomes quite a bit heavier alright so
let's take the protective plastic off
and that is very very nice cameraman
come get this angle over here right here
I'm pointing with my finger where the
cameraman needs to get all blocks the
latest oh okay hold on here I'll adjust
it for you
so there we go so that is just a bright
white you know what compared to the
photos it really does look way more like
stormtrooper armor here than it does
then it does in the in the pictures so
here's our five five and a quarter inch
bays you've got these cool little tabs
so cameraman can you zoom in so you can
have a look at how these tabs work you
just press the test a little button
right there and it opens it right up so
you don't have any any stupid metal
blocking things once you've taken these
off that's it that's the whole procedure
now the case is made of plastic but it's
a very very heavy plastic and it feels
very solid so you look at like little
things okay like the inside of the front
door you've got like a matte plastic
cover on the inside of the plastic outer
piece so you've got these layers that's
what gives it a rigidity that you
wouldn't normally expect from a plastic
case the hinge has also got large pegs
so they're not going to just come out
okay the door closes very very tightly
so the the fit and finish even though
this is a pre-production sample as I
mentioned before is perfect on the front
door
the only reason there's fingerprints all
over it or from me touching it here but
they wipe off quite easily another thing
that we should probably talk about
actually is fingerprint resistant of a
finish like this because it is quite
shiny the white colour is really good
for hiding it you can actually see that
already here on the camera because I'm
putting my hands all over it and we are
not running sorry about that my camera
battery ran out so okay fingerprint
resistance looks to be very very good at
least on the white colour let's start
having a look at some of the features so
right here we've got our fan controllers
so this is conveniently coated now I I
don't know what they all mean but I'm
gonna guess that this one with the two
big holes in it is maybe the two big
ones on the top I mean you can play
around with it and figure out what they
all are but there you are
that's where all of that is connected
then on the other side we've got our
power reset we've got our LED indicators
we have an eSATA two USB 2.0 mic port as
well as a headphone port alright
so that's pretty straightforward and
let's start let's have a look at the
side panels because I think that's
actually pretty note weight we're not
quite done with the front ok cameraman
if you want to come down here and have a
look that's where your 140 millimeter
fan mount is through that mesh right
there so you can see these meshes even
though they from a bit of a distance
there they're very they're a very solid
black so they give you kind of a nice
patterned appearance to the whole case
they're very free-flowing
so if you get close you can see through
it quite well and that means that you're
gonna get lots of airflow traveling
through them which is very very good of
course ok so let's move on to the side
let's start with this side just
arbitrarily this side so this side has
mesh poles here so you can see through
to the harddrive cages there you can see
the back of the motherboard plate there
and we'll find out what those holes are
well though I'll assume that they're for
power supply cable management and we've
got a thumb screw back here so why don't
I go ahead and I'll show you that so the
back is held on by optionally up to
three thumb screws but that just comes
with one which is fine because really
unless you're trying to I don't know
keep a you know cat or something out of
your case you don't need to worry about
too many screws holding on the side
panel so there's a side panel itself in
terms of the finish you can see it's
just a white paint so this parts metal
obviously so you can see the inside
there okay but the white paint finish on
the metal actually matches the white
plastic finish on the plastic perfectly
so you don't have to worry about like a
contrast in between those okay so that
side panel you know what we'll have a
closer look at that after let's have a
look at the back we've got a 120mm fan
here standard ATX layout here and room
for a standard ATX power supply here so
that's all pretty straightforward we
have up to four water cooling tubing
grommets all along the back of the case
and let's go ahead and look at the other
side panel before we take it open take
it apart and look at the inside so here
we've got our huge 200 or 230 millimeter
fan mounts
and then we have to leave those are 140s
help me out here on the side to 120s ha
you know what I bet that's what that
code is for the two two circled next to
each other oh well it's okay alright so
we'll take off our other wow these are
long thumb screws check this up can you
see that a huge thumb screws okay let's
take that off side panel comes up go
like I said Fintan finish might not be
quite right because this is not not a
retail case so here's the two fans that
are included there they're NZXT
black-and-white fans so I'm going to go
ahead and put this panel down since the
cameraman has done staring at that fan
and then we'll have a look at the inside
so this is a very roomy interior alright
we've got an accessory box here we've
got our seven three and a half inch
drive mounts here so why don't we have a
look at how this system works
this is oh you know what I like the
system this is used as a rubber grommet
so here I'll hold this in the Sun so you
can see it so you basically just push
the little metal pieces out push them
all out you slip in your hard drive you
push them back in and it seems flexible
now but once you get a hard drive in
there it's actually much much sturdier
it's you've also got the holes here for
a two and a half inch drive so then all
you do is slide that in there and boom
your hard drives installed very very
very simple okay in terms of the five
and a quarter inches you unlock them
here and okay come look at this this is
cool okay so you just slide the lock and
then it's actually
like a little flexible piece of plastic
and that's what that's what drives the
spikes into the side of the drive can
you see those spikes so you just bend it
up and then bend it back down and then
lock it and then it doesn't go anymore
that's pretty cool I've never seen one
quite like that before all right let me
just take out this twist tie here that
was holding in our accessory box and
let's have a look at what else we've got
here so you've got room for quite a long
pal supply although not entirely
unlimited in terms of length and you can
mount your power supply one of two ways
they have a here there's a filter at the
bottom here so you can have either a
filtered intake at the bottom or you can
flip your power supply around the other
way and have it take in case air
although I definitely recommend this
because they've got these rubber mounts
here that'll keep your power supply
elevated off the bottom of the case and
with the filtered intake that's
definitely going to be your best option
it supports up to e ATX motherboards so
that means you can go all the way over
to here with a very very large
potentially dual socket motherboard if
you felt like it you've got a CPU cut
out that's going to support most
motherboards CPU locations so that means
that you can take off a large tower heat
sinks or water blocks and put them back
on without taking the motherboard out of
the case here's our 120mm fan let's have
a look into the top of the case here all
right so there's our 200 mil cooling fan
and there's our spot for another one
this one is filtered and this one does
not appear to be filtered although I
couldn't tell you why at this time oh
it's possible that it's because the way
this is set up is for negative airflow
right now so that's why the open intakes
are actually filtered that would be my
that would be my educated guess okay and
let's see what else that we want to take
a look at here now one forty millimeter
intake comes in here let me just have a
quick look at where those so these 200
or these 120 millimeter fans here are
blowing all over your drives and they're
also bringing air into the front where I
can then be drawn across the video cards
and hopefully you have rear exhaust
video card I really think that would be
optimal for a case like this
let me see what else we should do why
don't we have a look at the included
accessories so pull up my tech tips
knife that I now actually carry almost
at all times
I cut myself with it the other day check
this out I tried to close it I was like
closing it like I don't know how I did
it but I managed to close it like right
on to my right onto my nail it didn't
hurt that much but well there you go
knives are dangerous be very careful
with them etcetera etc okay so here is a
little metal bracket - metal brackets
okay this is uh screws long screws okay
here's some cable ties as well as a PC
speaker because there's no integrated
speaker into the case you just plug a
little speaker thing into the top of
your motherboard and here's all these
screws that we will potentially need to
assemble our system all black screws I
love it those little touches that is
what really sets apart a premium case
from a me-too case so those are your 632
screws so those are your hard drive
screws all right here's your motherboard
standoffs
here's your 630 two screws flat so those
ones are probably for installing
something presumably motherboard
although there's not enough of them
there's only eight okay so I don't
actually know what those are for and we
have 632 longer ones okay I'm sure there
is an instruction manual well there is
an instruction manual I'm sure it tells
us what to do all the follow these a
bunch of thumb screws so there's a
little baggie of thumb screws cool and
then here we have some fan screws here
we have some 632 hex screws so those I'm
presuming here for the power supply and
then we have some m3 screws so those
would be used for optical drives if we
wanted to double secure the optical
drive so you can see you can use the
little flexi note thing here and then
there's also two screw holes right in
the front which the cameraman cannot see
from that
a little bit he'll try and cameraman
wants me to look at the back of the case
for some reason anyway as for those
screws go and oh right we haven't looked
at the back of the case yet that's why
the cameraman is not pointing over there
so here's all of the included cables
this is getting to be quite a long video
but hopefully you can bear with me here
here's power for your fan controller
this uses nice beefy wires because you
are providing up to 20 watts per channel
or maybe it's 20 watts total either way
it can provide power to some pretty
decent fans so I wouldn't worry too much
about it hard drive LEDs so there's all
your front connectors nice black cable
happy to see that we've got a you sat
out front connector right there and then
what else do we have here we've got HD
audio there's a USB header and these are
nicely sleeved black and then we've got
a couple of oh right these are for the
three aspects of the fan controller that
are not located up here so the ones that
are not already plugged in so you can
see we've got two more up here
so there's your five five leads off the
integrated fan controller just like that
okay well I think that pretty much
covers everything I wanted to talk about
get one more dramatic shot of the front
here because I really think that is what
stands out about this case more than
anything else is the look of it from the
front and kind of seeing the top as well
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the NZXT phantom I hope you've
enjoyed it I certainly have I can
already tell you these are going to sell
like hotcakes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
