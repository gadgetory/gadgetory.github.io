just finished up like a day of testing a
bunch of different stuff on this with
liquid metal and without liquid metal
and now we're going to put that guy
right there on this is the world's most
unusual water block it looks normal on
the surface copper on the bottom plexi
and metal on the top but the secret
sauce is it actually replaces the
integrated heat spreader of your CPU
making direct contact with the dye this
is madness
hopefully private Internet access is
exactly what it sounds like
the VPN that encrypts all your Internet
traffic and uses a safe protected IP
stay tuned to learn more you know what's
funny is we're kind of coming full
circle here this actually reminds me of
the danger dan' PDX so that was a really
old block designed for back before AMD
CPUs in particular had integrated heat
spreaders so the secret sauce here
really is just the way that nude CNC has
designed the base of their block in the
shape of the underside of an integrated
heat spreader so you can see this lip
right here is designed to be sealed on
to the substrate these right here are
designed to be held by the socket
retention mechanism and then this flat
surface right here you can actually see
an outline from testing they must have
done at the factory this is a prototype
unit you can see the outline of where ad
I was making contact with it before so
how's the mounting work first we got to
delete it right yeah
well it's already been depleted no not
right now obviously but it should come
off pretty easily so one of the big ways
that enthusiasts have been improving
temperatures in some cases very
dramatically over the last few
generations is removing the integrated
heat spreader from the CPU like alex is
doing now Andrew
lacing the stock thermal compound that's
in there with something a little more
potent either a high-performance paste
or in extreme cases even liquid metal
but the theory here is that nothing I
guess that's for the name nude cnc comes
from yeah nothing is better than
anything so we're removing a full layer
of thermal interface material and
additional metal between the water and
the dye which is where the heat is
actually generated this is freaking
crazy like you look at how thin
everything we're dealing with this the
tolerances for this have to be so tight
which is why we're using a 7700 k for
our testing rather than an 80 700 K
because as far as we know that's what
this particular prototype is validated
on it probably would work for an 80 700
K though probably but go back a couple
of generations to when Intel was using a
thicker package material and maybe not
maybe you'd over tighten it which I mean
look at this thing
you don't want to do it so thin as a
chip well let's get some liquid metal
off of this first just for the like nice
new application we already put a whole
bunch of conformal coating on this for
everyone that's wondering I'm just gonna
give it the old shirt treatment here I'm
sure that it's nice and clean kids don't
try this at home
certified ESD safe yeah so we put this
in the socket first there we go
where's our dot think it's this way okay
so here you can see what I was talking
about before where you do need some kind
of IHS on it to even hold the CPU in
place because that's how these mounting
mechanisms work see there's far too much
play in there you won't be making
adequate contact between the pads on the
bottom of the CPU and the pins in the
socket
there's something about German that
makes warnings so much more fun Varnum
Nick Meade alluminium cooler corporate
carbon Berto Ryan didn't wear his like
the English ones like warning do not use
aluminum heat sinks alright what's next
so we apply this right in the socket
that's latte I can sort of get it in
there and then just pull out and it'll
like deflate it's really weird so this
is the trickiest part you can see this
notch is smaller and it's offset
compared to the one that's built into
the integrated heat spreader that is
that you can kind of start it over here
move it where it will actually be held
down and then tighten the whole thing
down this is crazy like that is crazy
that's oh no I guess we need to drain
the sketchy loop what we need to put the
fittings in there you don't have to have
you've been wasting time in between runs
draining loops wrong with you that is
how you break motherboards he broke the
dual socket c6 21 sage a $700 board
there is a crater in the socket oh my
god there's so much water coming out how
are you how are you going to flip those
around bit rates water everywhere
what are you that rates do you want to
at least pour some out I don't think
these are gonna fit yeah these don't
work oh damn okay I'll get the zip ties
no you know what we could do is yeah so
we're just gonna go no collars on the
compression fittings we're just gonna
use compressions as standard Barb's
fortunately alex is gone right now
because I'm quite certain he would not
approve of what I'm about to do I'm just
gonna go for like a speed mount here oh
no water
like I lifted it too high maybe we can
fix it before he gets back okay hold on
you're saying about not draining the
loop just gotta absorb the water first
the power supply was way below that
below it now it should be fine
is that going to dissolve the tubing
yeah that's not gonna touch the tubing
I just want it on the board I need to
don't want it in the block though not
really it's in the block now okay I just
need it to carry away the water let's uh
that's an acrylic block so that might
add I really hope that this whole
survives I'll be right back with an air
compressor I settled for this it was a
lot lighter to bring up the stairs it's
about to get really stinky in here
no no nothing got over that been wasting
time in between runs draining loops
wrong with you I mean realistically
after applying this kind of heat to it
it's probably drier than it was before
spelling it I'm still picking up some
alcohol smell here that means it's
probably not all evaporated look I wish
I had all the time in the world to do
things carefully and properly would have
been like a minute here we go
hey that really gets the liquid metal
going oh hey yeah I guess it's way more
liquidy now yeah so let's put that bad
boy on there again what could possibly
go wrong okay yeah it's on there okay
having learned nothing I'm just gonna
quickly look quickly quickly
see how we're quickly doing that
and quickly good yeah
pro move is to tighten it clockwise so
that that way you're tightening the
Barba's you tighten your zip tie plug in
pump clubbing around I got this right
way around right yeah okay good I'm like
legit excited right now I am a bit
concerned okay let's do it that doesn't
have a switch yep
thought some time okay switching oh it's
part which okay it's just hiding there
it is we're gonna find out if it posts
that would be pretty funny hey breaking
the board in between all the testing
yeah there you go
all the RAM is picked up see no problem
no problem
alright so what are we trying to beat
here so we're looking for fifty three
point four degrees is our average
temperature with the custom loop before
okay and that was with liquid metal that
was with liquid metal that's the mark to
beat I feel like Windows search has
gotten worse over time
but somehow they did it I agree with you
stress up to you hit it yep okay oh damn
that's looking like it might be a little
better
4650 so what was the mark to beat max
before was 58 Wow alright well let's
give it half an hour and make sure but
this is looking really promising okay
it's been 23 minutes just doing a quick
check in here everything alright okay
it's still up not only are these
temperatures outstanding but look at
that spread damn core to core
temperatures are within like three
degrees and this has clearly stabilized
like this is it this is all we get so
with an average of 51 point five degrees
we are almost a full two degrees cooler
on average than we were with our liquid
medaled IHS so remember that that's key
two degrees we dropped and we haven't
even overclocked yet you ready so far
everything seems to be behaving totally
normally oh we are at that clock speed
oh it's beautiful
let's hit it wow that's like the same
temperature like 0s given about five
gigahertz check this out
five gigahertz at fifty five to sixty
degrees because remember this water is
already pre warmed like there's no way
this has had enough time to cool down
fully Wow like look at the spread though
that's what's crazy to me the
consistency come on just try going
higher yeah we've got nothing to lose
okay
so how hard do we hit it I don't know it
seems like some people are getting like
5.5 with 1.5 volts so okay I'm trying
5.4 at 1.5 volts we might be getting
into windows at 5.4 no no we're not I
mean let's just see let's type 5.3 we're
in 4 into windows we are most certainly
running at 5 I hate it when it does this
5.29 takes the satisfaction right out of
it Wow so if we had a chip and a board
that could handle higher frequency with
this kind of voltage our cooling would
still be well under control look at that
we have settled in at around 65 to 75
degrees on all four of our course so to
put that in perspective that is about
what we might expect on a CPU like this
at stock speeds with like an adequate
but unexceptional air cooler so the
conclusion here is both complicated and
simple the simple part of it is that the
nude CNC whatever this thing is called
it's a cult inquire performs better than
any water cooling solution that makes
contact with the IHS even if your IHS is
liquid metal the part that's complicated
is that the end core requires
voiding the warranty of your processor
in order to achieve these gains so we're
not gonna recommend it but we're not
gonna say that it's not super cool
either in no particular order here are
some reasons to use private Internet
access one it hides your true IP address
and geographic location two it allows
you to browse a nominal mislead it
allows you to browse and anima Slee
keeping your identity hidden which is
especially important for political
dissidents journalists human rights
activists etc 3 it allows you to avoid
data mining and targeted advertising for
it allows you to block unwanted
connections with advanced firewall and
filtering capabilities 6 it allows you
to unblock websites bypassing lots of
get you know what the point is there's a
lot of reasons and it's super affordable
which is cool so check it out at the
link in the video description so if this
video sucked you guys can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we featured at
the link below while you're down there
you can check out our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one as well as
our community forum we will see you in
the next video at least I will you might
not be there you did break that
motherboard but you spilled water all
over this one and it isn't broken the
one that's coming apparently is better
than the one that I broke Gary's just
trying to help you out he said to give
me a bonus ok she did not I'm on the
