unboxing of the Sony Bloggie so the
model this is is the MHS PM 5k I don't
know what color it is yet but the basic
specs that you see right on the front
are that it records in Full HD 1080 ok
then we move around to the back and you
can see all the different things that
have support for so you can upload an
email directly from the blog e to
Shutterfly Picasa YouTube as well as
Facebook so you can easily share with
your friends and family you plug it into
your PC using a built-in USB port so
it's kind of like the the flip Mino HD
in that respect you don't actually have
to fuss around with any cables or
anything like that you just plug right
in and it also includes a 360 video lens
so that means that you can take video in
360 degrees around the camera and
there's no way that I could go without
testing that it works on Mac it works on
PC it supports SDHC which is great I'm
glad Sony's finally supporting these
standard memory cards rather than only
memory stick but it also does support
memory stick okay so the first thing we
find in the box you know what I'm gonna
go ahead and put this on the camera
man's hood he's probably cringing while
I do that but the first thing we find is
a driver disk then we have a quick
little instruction paper that shows you
how to take out the USB port then we
have for us customers receive 15% off
your next purchase of something limited
warranty card consumer one-year warranty
terms then you've got an important
notice well if it is important then
surely we'll have to have a look
don't disassemble your battery pack
don't drop it in water all that kind of
important stuff thank you for drawing
our attention to that mobile HD snap
camera instruction manual here is the
manual and then for if your product is
not working properly do not return it to
the store okay alright so let's see what
we find inside first of all this is
probably the most exciting accessory in
the box this is the 360 degree lens so
this allows it this allows us to take
video in 360 degrees around the Bloggie
so yeah obviously we will have to try
that alright that goes there for now
then we have a composite video as well
as audio output
so we can output directly from the blog
II then we have a USB extension cable oh
ok in case there's no I see what this is
for so you can plug that into your
computer in case there's not enough
space like if your ports are crowded and
then you can plug the blog into this end
then we have oh they include a memory
stick wow they include a 4 gig memory
stick Pro duo that's nice I mean I
remember the last time I bought a camera
it came with I think it was like an 8
Meg SD card or something stupid like
that
ok then we've got you we have a little
like Shammi case for it so you can
either use that to wipe off your screen
or you can potentially store it in it
although it doesn't really look big
enough for that yeah it's not big enough
for that ok I don't get the point of
this but it's there and then we have a
wrist strap down there and last but not
least we have a battery so let's get the
battery out let's put the battery in so
I guess the first thing we're gonna
learn today is how to put the battery
into this thing
rotate to power on and okay I powered it
on I can't quite figure out the battery
yet but I'll get there don't worry
there's the USB as well as the audio and
video out so that's where we find all of
our our inputs and outputs so you just
slide this little switch right here to
get the USB port out you've also you've
got a little tripod mount so just in
case you wanted to take a little video
on your little tripod you could do that
so this is how you turn it on you just
rotate this right here so the screen can
come out this way or it can come out the
top or it can come up that way so if you
actually if you're mounting your 360
degree lens it actually goes on just
like this something like that yeah there
we go so it just clips on like that and
then that's how you can take video all
the way around the Bloggie so here's
either speaker or a microphone one of
the two and then this says lithium ah ah
there's my battery nice so the battery
goes in here just like that secured in
by a little blue tab and then I'm gonna
throw my memory stick in here as well
since they were kind enough to include
one for me hopefully I'm putting that in
the right way and why don't we try and
turn this baby on so here let's take off
our three
60 degree lens and then see what happens
if we turn it on so is it on is this
thing on cool okay so we can actually
see right now we can take video of the
camera man's new car which we're
actually going to use the blog II to do
like a a video tour of very shortly here
so we can either take pictures just by
pressing that button well there's a bit
of a shutter delay there see I press the
button oh and I press the button there
and it takes a photo there so you can
kind of live with that it's designed to
be a video device and then we are taking
video at 720p 30 frames per second right
now so I'm not actually going to show
you this video I'll do another one
shortly anyway that is my quick unboxing
of the Sony Bloggie if you want to see
any quick menu things actually why don't
we do that really quickly so here let's
have a look at our video options so we
can go up to 1080p 30 frames per second
we can go all the way down to VGA 30
frames per second if we want to all
those 720 720p 60 frames per second
that's going to be probably your sweet
spot where you're gonna get nice smooth
video and good HD quality and then for
photos you can either go all the way
down to VGA terrible terrible quality
photos or you can go all the way up to 5
megapixels you can turn face detection
on and off and that's pretty much it
there's not a whole lot of options here
oh here's all the options flicker
reduction LED backlight language
settings can you read this camera around
okay could initialize that format copy
okay cool so that's pretty cool we're
gonna do a quick tour of the Camerons
car and then thank you for checking out
my unboxing of the Sony Bloggie</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
