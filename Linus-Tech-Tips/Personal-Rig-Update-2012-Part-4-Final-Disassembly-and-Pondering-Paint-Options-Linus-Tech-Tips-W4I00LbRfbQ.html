I guess I'll preface this by saying this
will be another another small update
about my personal rig upgrade that's
going on here so one of the things that
I've decided is that I am going to three
powdercoat the internals of the case so
I found a place locally that will strip
off all the old powder coating I'm a
chemical bath they need it for a few
days it's going to cost about 60 bucks
they figure and then I'm going to send
the internals back down to Mountain Lots
as well as the optical drive and
especially the pieces that I missed last
time like this one so that the whole
inside will be uniform and black instead
of having some parts of it still left
with the natural aluminum color hold on
a second this is one of the reasons to
buy a high end case by the way guys as
you can see I've now stripped it down to
just the unibody chassis are the unibody
frame and you can pull out all of the
drive cages there's actually more pieces
over here the support braces for the
back you can pull out the motherboard
mount to the plate so all of these are
going to be stripped down and then what
I'm going to do is I'm going to do a bit
of a trial run build of the machine to
see if there's any more cable management
that I need to add for myself so one of
the things that I mentioned before is I
thought I might need a bigger gap back
here in order to run more cables up to
the back of the motherboard tray so I
might do that one of the other things I
might do is build myself in some better
options in terms of running water
cooling through the mid plate because
right now these holes don't really line
up perfectly with with what I'm trying
to do so that's one thing I'll consider
I still haven't figured out a way to
address the problem with this this hole
right here but
so I haven't really decided if I'm going
to do that one of the things that I'll
probably do is cut out a CPU of whatever
they're called motherboard tray CPU
cutout here so that I can more easily
swap out CPU coolers I mean the cooler
I'm going to be using the Apogee HD
there is is a fairly easy to mount one
because there's no aftermarket backplate
it just uses the stock LGA 2011
backplate but I mean you never know
what's going to happen in the future and
I don't necessarily want to repower coat
my case every oh hey don't eat the screw
hey come on come on come on over there
you have it in your mouth okay I don't
necessarily want to reap outer put the
case every time I do a new build so
that's uh that would be my reasoning for
for just making sure I do everything
right this time hopefully I don't have
to do it next time ah yeah the place the
place that's stripping off the powder
coating also does plating so I'm
thinking about potentially depending on
what the cost is going to be like um
there's a couple there's a couple
options so one option would be gold
plating the Copperhead blocks so that
they can sit on top of the Copperhead
Ram so I've got two of these but then I
really not sure if I want to do that and
then the other thing is that you can
actually strip the nickel plating off
this guy and then gold plate it instead
but one of my concerns about that is
they said that when you're stripping the
nickel plating off it will actually
attack the copper as well and so when
they then plate the gold back on there
might be some imperfections in the
finish so am I better off with something
that doesn't match but it is finished
perfectly or am I better off with
something that matches but doesn't
finish perfectly I don't know so I think
that's pretty much it for the update
right now I still haven't really made a
made a solid decision about what I want
to do
the outer chassis whether I want to get
it painted because this part is still
pretty perfect but the side panels are
in rough shape there's a look we use for
the the Vesta special edition systems
painting those they do a really good job
and they're not that expensive so if you
get some kind of automotive paint finish
going on on here maybe some color change
paint or something I haven't decided how
crazy I want to go yet on this um okay
actually I think we're we're pretty much
wrapped up here here's one of the last
pieces of the case so pretty much all
the pieces of the case are down here now
I'm just gonna take these fans off and
then this is not going into mountain mod
so it's only these middle pieces so I
got to take these in get them stripped
first including these which means I'm
going to do these black wrinkles so
they'll at least match the inside of the
case and yeah every once in a while and
I'm working on a build I I find
something that obviously I know how to
do but I have no idea how I did this
like look look at this so so this
bracket the way it works is you got your
metal pieces folded here here here here
and here and I've used rubber
noise-isolating mounts to mount these
fans in here but I don't know how I got
these in here and how I'm going to get
them out this is ridiculous so uh the
reason I even care is because I'm going
to get this black wrinkled powder-coated
as well just to match the grilles in the
front they won't be the same kind of
match but at least still be the same
color but cheese well I'll figure it out
anyway don't forget to subscribe and
that's what a TJ o7 looks like with
almost nothing left in it so there you
go</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
