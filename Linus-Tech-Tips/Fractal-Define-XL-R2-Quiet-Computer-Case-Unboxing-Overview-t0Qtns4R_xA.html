Intel Core i5 46 70k unlocked processor
add an Intel 520 series SSD to your
Haswell system for unbelievable overall
performance the fractal design define
excel is so large that I had to no I'm
just kidding actually I reused my table
a little bit we're going to lower that
welcome to my unboxing on first look at
the define XLR to this case from fractal
design is pretty much as b-roll put it
before we started is this kind of like
the define r4 but bigger and I said yes
yes indeed it is an Excel version of
their defined series case that has that
same Scandinavian clean lines look to it
b-roll is indicating two microphones
over here thank you for that has that
same Scandinavian clean lines look to it
but in a larger enclosure so this case
only supports four five and a quarter
inch base and eight three and a half
inch or two and a half inch bays so in
terms of sort of mere mortal expansion
the kind of thing most normal people
would do with their systems it doesn't
really seem to offer that much over the
define r4 however and there goes the
chandelier see it is actually quite big
there we go
however when you get into some of the
more exotic things you might want to do
with your system like liquid cooling for
example that is where the XR XL really
shines so we've got a very hard foam
here not my personal favorite however it
does compensate by at least being quite
thick so hopefully your case won't
undergo more than one significant impact
on its way to you particularly if you
have a system built and loaded into it
so there we go we're done with the
packing material there it comes with a
plastic sleeve over top that is of
course and this is very important folks
recyclable got that recycling logo on
there on my side you couldn't see it
before we don't worry too much about
that all right
the case itself so for the sake of
getting a sort of a idea of the scale of
this case go ahead and take a step back
this is what it looks like next to a
hulking six foot four figure of
masculine unbelievably anise no actually
I'm Vaughn five six so that should give
you a better idea of how big the case
actually is so we're gonna go ahead and
peel off the front it is available in
black or titanium gray in terms of the
door it's pretty much what you'll expect
if you've ever seen a defined series
case before so there is noise dampening
foam on the inside of the front door
here that helps some of the noise that
would otherwise escape from the front be
harnessed and used for good rather than
evil we've also got two lessly removable
five and a quarter inch bay covers
hopefully I can you'll see the thing
about tool is five and a quarter inch
Bay cover is is that you have to not be
a tool in order to remove them and put
them back in correctly so if you guys
are if you guys aren't able to do it
don't feel too bad but your your tool
awesome not just King at the front we've
got two one hundred and forty millimeter
cooling fan spots with built in filters
that you can go ahead and do that with
okay you also have the option to mount
one hundred and twenty millimeter fans
here using the optional holes but you
can see that the tooless mechanism that
uses clips right here to mount the fan
is only available with one hundred and
forty millimeter fans the case itself
includes their new are two series fans
which have better bearings than the
older fans I spent at a thousand rpm
which is in line with the cool and quiet
but mostly silent mostly quiet theme of
this particular case you can also see
that there are mounting options right
here for 140 or 120 millimeter things
from the inside as well more on that
look at this I'm using the word tool I'm
using the word moron I'm not trying to
say anything about you know the case
don't worry good case fractal design
makes good stuff I like it alright up at
the top of the case wah two USB 2.0
ports two USB 3.0 ports a power button a
reset button a headphone jack and a
microphone jack also on the top of the
case we have two modules so these are
for 140 millimeter fan slots as well and
you can either leave them in for optimal
silence or you can take them out for
better cooling also for cooling are
these vents on the front so down both
sides of the front of the case there is
airflow access for that front fan
because if it was up to the door
nothing would be getting through no
window on this particular case but we do
find another mod you vent ah there we go
with 120 or 140 millimeter fan mounting
option available to it but it's screwed
into the 140 millimeter fan mounts and
finally let's move around to the back
where we've got another 140 or 120
millimeter fan mount IO as well as 9 PCI
slots so you can fit your XL ATX
motherboard in there and your firstborn
child and a muffin and probably some
like cigarettes if you're trying to hide
them from your family not that I condone
smoking it's terrible for your computer
never mind your lungs I mean it's bad
for your computer that should be all the
reason you need to stop that tar gets
into your heat sinks and your fans and
gums them up and makes it so they don't
work very well in heaven forbid you
smoke and you have pets because then
you're gonna have tar and hair in your
heat sinks and let me tell you heat
sinks don't work very well when they are
full of tar and hair speaking of things
that are full of tar and hair actually
these are not full of tar hair but they
are high density noise dampening pieces
that go on both the left and right side
panel of this case they increase the
weight of the case significantly but
they also make it more resistant to
noise passing through it so I consider
that a good thing especially given that
it's a silent optimized case which I
think I've mentioned at least a couple
times now here's the other one so you
can see that maje of nth has a slightly
different kind of foam on it's a bit of
a lower density foam so it has some you
can press it in a little bit there but
it's thicker to compensate because we
although I did my unboxing of the 900 D
it's not about the length it's about the
girth there you go all right inside the
case we find five four five and a
quarter inch bays rather and no toolless
mechanisms on them that's kind of an
interesting one those have been standard
for a while personally I don't care the
last time I mounted something in a five
and a quarter inch bay it was a gerbil
and I wasn't planning to use it for
anything useful because what can a
gerbil do that's useful nothing let's go
ahead and take off these this is what I
was alluding to on the inside so you can
go ahead and remove these thumb screws
and that allows you to achieve something
very entry
sting which I'm buying time before I get
to yeah yeah let's see if I can take
this out there we go all right so you
can reposition the drive cages so you
can open this up to get more airflow
access for your graphics cards so that
front 140 millimeter fan you can see is
right there and that will allow it to
blow directly on your graphics cards
this also gives you access to the haha
yes those mounting points there so the
defined XLR to supports a 240 or 280
millimeter radiator in the front a 240
or 280 millimeter radiator up here in
the top it also supports a 120 or 140
millimeter radiator in the back and a
140 millimeter radiator in the bottom of
the case without much difficulty
whatsoever so it is extremely flexible
in that regard radiator support on this
case is extensive it supports a 2 by 120
millimeter radiator in the front a 2 by
120 or 2 by 140 if you're using a slim
radiator in the top it supports a single
120 or 140 millimeter radiator in the
back although I'd say 140 might be a
little bit a little bit tight you might
be able to kind of figure it out in
there and a single 120 in the bottom
however should be noted that in the
bottom here I'd I say 140 because I'm at
120 in the bottom here you might have a
little bit of difficulty with that if
you decide to reposition the front hard
drive cage so this hard drive cage go
ahead and close that can move in about
this much giving you the ability to
install thicker radiators up there no
problem but that will obviously
interfere with this fan and then this
hard drive cage which I showed you
before can either be installed the way
that it was out of the box or check this
out
it can be installed this way giving you
a good compromise between airflow and
hem well basically airflow but you
sacrifice aesthetics a little bit
because instead of the hard drives
plugging in in the back of the case back
here there we go they plug in from the
inside of the case where you would be
able to see them if you had a window on
the chassis but we don't so not to worry
about that also on the back of the case
we find lots of other things we've got a
large CPU cutout as well as cable
management holes for your 8 pin your you
know bottle
no other pin your 24 pin your 6 pin your
8 pin your other more different a pin
your you front connectors so these are
all black cables which is nice to see
there's your front USB there's your
front HD audio there's your front USB 2
as well as your power and reset all
things that you will most assuredly need
the case does have built-in fan control
that I missed when I was at the front
here because I totally forgot 12 volt 7
volt and 5 volt are available with 3
different positions on the switch and
these can be plugged into three separate
fans conveniently the case includes
three fans boom mind blown so you plug
that in using this guy right here so
there's molex power for that as well as
the four three pin connectors for the
fans themselves I think that is pretty
much going to wrap it up for the define
XLR - thank you for checking out my
unboxing let me know what you think
would you prefer the compact
functionality of the define r4 which is
significantly smaller than this guy or
do you prefer the largeness and the
flexibility to add more advanced cooling
options to the case or a longer
motherboard or more graphics cards and
would you go with something like the
define XL instead don't forget to
subscribe - tech tips don't forget to
like the video it helps me out a whole
lot and just try to think ask them to
comment ask them to subscribe ask them
to like I could use a new hat while
we're at it if that's not too much work
