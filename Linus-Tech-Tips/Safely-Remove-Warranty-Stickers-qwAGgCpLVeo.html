consider myself a little like Danny
ocean and not just because of bull you
know world travel fashion sense and
flashy cars but because often in order
to do what I do I need to be able to get
in and out of a secure area with no one
the wiser
only instead of casinos and banks my
theater of operations is consumer
electronics and instead of circumventing
high-tech laser security systems and
armed guards I carefully remove those
warranty void stickers without damaging
them so that they can be reapplied it's
a wild ride living your life on the
razor's edge and you know what I'm going
to be showing you guys how to do it
today
Oh
I buy power and MSI's new lineup of
gaming laptops feature Intel seventh
generation core i7 processors check them
out at the link below
warranty stickers here's a question are
those even legally binding let's check
in with the line of tech tips legal team
for a brief primer oh hi
now as you may or may not know a
warranty included in the box with an
electronic device like a game console or
smartphone is actually just a kind of
contract now if one side breaks or
breaches a contract the other side
doesn't have to perform in this case
that would mean that the manufacturer
could void your warranty but there's an
exception to this there's a US federal
law called the Magnuson Moss Warranty
Act of 1975 now this is a law that says
a manufacturer can't make a tie-in sale
a condition of a warranty well what's
that well a tie-in sale is when the
warranty says that you can only get your
device repaired at an authorized dealer
or use authorized replacement parts so
this means if you decide to repair your
device on your own or use an aftermarket
part they can't void your warranty just
based on that and that includes breaking
those little warranty void of remove
stickers so if the law covers these
stickers
why do manufacturers keep putting them
other products well the manufacturers
know that the only way that they can be
forced to provide warranty service is if
some bikes into court and Sue them over
to sticker
unfortunately the companies also know
that the cost of hiring a lawyer and
actually going through with this is
usually going to be a lot higher than
just getting the probably prepared in
the first place me these companies are
more or less getting away with this and
it'll probably take something like a
class-action lawsuit which is
essentially a bunch of people suing one
or more companies to end this behavior
the only time that either opening your
device or performing a self repair or
taking it to a third-party repair shop
can actually void your warranty is if
they do an improper repair
proper upgrade that actually causes the
device to malfunction or break this
simply means don't break your own stuff
and you'll still be covered under a
warranty it's against the law for these
manufacturers to tell you that you don't
have a right to try to repair your
product on your own terms
thanks John now let's get to what you
all came to see
legality aside what is the best way to
remove and replace a warranty sticker so
that an apathetic minimum-wage employee
can't tell you did it there are tons of
tips online about this but we felt the
need to test them for ourselves because
as you guys know very well
just because someone posts something
online doesn't mean it's a good idea and
you wouldn't believe the number of
unqualified people posting up
disreputable tech advice these days the
electrostatic bag and heat gun combo
method wasn't a runaway success it
actually did work modestly well on
stickers that were already fairly loose
or poorly applied in the first place but
in tougher situations we often ended up
tearing the sticker while the materials
you need are very likely to be lying
around and the nonstick properties of
the bag are helpful it's also extremely
unwieldly and hard to control so this
one's a bit like using a medical love as
a condom sure it might work in certain
situations but it should never be your
go-to solution
steam it works for letters so it should
work for stickers right wrong your
reservations about exposing your
electronics to a jet of gaseous water
aside the steam just ended up being far
harder on the sticker itself then it was
on the glue holding it while it did
weaken the bond somewhat it also caused
the sticker to fall apart like a twice
used tissue so 10 out of 10
highly recommended IGN a straight
utility or hobby knife probably seems
like a bit of a dicey proposition and it
is yes with sufficient care patience and
luck it is possible to remove a sticker
with minimal to no damage by this method
but a simple slip of the hand or a
little too much pressure at the wrong
moment can easily lead to a cut or a
tear that will give the game away or
worse put an unsightly scratch or scuff
on your precious device next we found a
guide online in which a fellow Kanak
actually went through this process for
building a teflon knife for exactly this
purpose but unfortunately sourcing the
materials and manufacturing this kind of
tool is both costly and potentially
dangerous without sufficient tools and
training so our journey for a low-cost
easy solution continued we eventually
found ourselves deep in the darkest
dankest and most dangerous parts of the
internet a community of competitive
rubik's cube enthusiasts and it was
actually there that we found our Holy
Grail a plastic razor specifically
designed for peeling the stickers off
toy puzzle cubes it removes warranty
stickers just as easily as a metal razor
but is a lot more forgiving in terms of
avoiding damage to
the product it was not only able to lift
the warranty protection off a ps4 but it
also managed to peel back the entire
warranty label on a hard drive intact
now both metal and plastic razors work
much better with a little solvent to
help them but you need to be careful
about what you use you can find an
almost inexhaustible list of household
products that people claim will work to
help remove adhesives but it's not
always necessary or even advisable to
encase your sticker in peanut butter
freeze it overnight sprinkle it with
ginger or rub it with the dew of
north-facing leaves so we tried out the
three most reasonable and easily
accessible solvents that you're likely
to have kicking around nail polish
remover rubbing alcohol and vinegar nail
polish remover was very effective at
immediately removing the glue and
dissolving most of the sticker as well
vinegar fell on the opposite end of the
spectrum even after leaving it to soak
it barely made a dent in the adhesive
and when we attempted to pry the sticker
off there was significant tearing
isopropyl alcohol hits the perfect sweet
spot in terms of loosening the sticker
enough that we could get a prying tool
in without damaging it in the process
now it is important to note that some
stickers are designed to peel back and
leave residue on the surface changing
the appearance of the sticker to read
void and prevent replacement if you come
across this use a marker or a rollerball
pen to color the reverse of the sticker
as you lift it that should allow you to
press the sticker back down and maintain
the appearance that it hasn't been moved
though it should be noted that this
won't help in cases where the
manufacturer would have to remove that
sticker in order to perform whatever
warranty repair is required now in a
perfect world none of this would matter
because consumer protection laws but on
planet earth where I live anytime you
open your device there is a very strong
chance that if your manufacturer
realizes it they will refuse to honor
your warranty without a costly and
potentially very time-consuming legal
battle so whether you want to make an
upgrade to a prebuilt computer change
out a cooler on a graphics card or just
poke around inside your gadgets because
they belong to you out of principle do
it carefully and we hope you guys found
