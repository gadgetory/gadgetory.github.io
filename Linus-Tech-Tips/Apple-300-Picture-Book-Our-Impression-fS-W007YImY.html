you may see Linus Media Group is a
ragtag Assembly of video creators but we
see ourselves unapologetically as
visionaries a source of inspiration for
generations to come and since everyone
and their Butler has a book we thought
to ourselves why shouldn't we well an
obvious answer might be it's hard to
think of things to write that are good
but then it struck us would someone who
is willing to pay $300 so they can feel
like part of an exclusive club for
owning a book really care about reading
the words anyway so we began what would
turn into an hour's long mission to
bottle our genius condensing it down to
an exhilarating Bible of the very
essence of Linus Media Group one that
you could hold in your hand and say I
just spent real actual money on pictures
of what they used to do instead of a
real product they make today
made by linus Media Group in Langley
British Columbia is more than just a
stunning collection of photos of the
amazing work we did last week it's a
living breathing metaphor created right
here in our workshop our workshop really
is a workshop in it we make what some
would describe as art but what we would
consider to be truly transcendent of
that word for every project we complete
tools have to be purchased from the
local hardware store and often since we
don't know how to use them yet the
innovation comes from trying to learn to
use them as we go the book goes beyond
these moments beyond these discoveries
it's a quiet dignified tone of
storytelling which is why every copy is
handcrafted it's meant to serve as a
looking glass into the magical creative
process here at Linus Media Group the
last half of the book is mostly pictures
of me and the book is also dedicated to
me and now word from our sponsors
