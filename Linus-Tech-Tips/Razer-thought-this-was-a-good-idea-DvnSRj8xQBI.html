stupid products from ones that obviously
can't live up to their lofty claims to
ones that are just playing bad ideas to
begin with and most of the time I don't
even bother trying this stuff out but
when a company with as much clout as
razor brings a new headset to market one
that claims to vibrate your head with
intelligent haptic technology well
there's just no way that I cannot try it
but here's the most surprising thing of
all these might somehow even at $200 be
worth a fair shake

when razors nari ultimate headset
arrived I was pretty skeptical actually
I was skeptical before it arrived
I mean first I disagreed with their
premise that sound is just as important
to sight when you're in game it is
possible to play csgo without sound it
is not possible to play without a
monitor then I mean I wasn't sure that I
even wanted a rumble pack strapped to my
head and besides I mean technically
speaking don't all headphones vibrate
isn't that just how speakers work okay
so the difference here is that on top of
having regular 50 millimeter dynamic
drivers which do in fact vibrate to make
sound the nari Ultimates are also
outfitted with a pair one in each cup of
l5 haptic drivers from low felt who you
may remember from such memorable
products as the baselet wearable
subwoofer like speakers the haptic
drivers articulate according to the
signal coming over the speaker cable but
unlike speakers which move a diaphragm
to create sound energy these use
actuators that move back and forth
turning electrical energy into
mechanical energy okay that's pretty
similar but it's like bigger so yes it
is kind of like a rumble pack on your
head but it's a very different kind of
Rumble than what you get from a
controller so unlike a controller Rumble
which has only very coarse control like
that the developer actually has to
specifically program into their game
like though you crash into a wall the
nari ultimates implementation requires
no software support at all and responds
in real time over a frequency range of
20 to 200 Hertz which actually
conveniently overlaps with the headphone
drivers own frequency response
so in other words the headphones are not
relying on the haptic drivers for the
users low frequency sensation
they're just augmenting it with them so
how does it sound or feel well depending
on the application these can actually
have a surprisingly impactful part in
the punch positive effect that is
similar to the sensation of standing
near a kick drum or next to a large
floorstanding speaker at a concert and
feeling the air move over you in time
with the music as you listen obviously
it doesn't move over you but the point
is you can feel it so we tested the nari
Ultimates with games music and movies
and the main takeaway for those of you
who won't make it any further into the
video than this is that if the content
has consistent low tones explosions
gunfire pounding bass these will make
the content more engrossing and
immersive so you can actually use Razer
synapse software to not just toggle the
haptics which Razer is branding as hyper
sense on and off but also adjust the
intensity through a nine step range in
shooter games which are probably the
best use of these puppies so far James
had high percents cranked up to 10
loving every second of it as for me I
preferred more in the range of eight but
I still had it cranked up pretty high
and it's honestly it's really cool
weapons feel more physical like more
powerful and more immediate explosions
feel way more epic and like I didn't
like I put them on and I was like yeah
my head's vibrating but I didn't realize
how much cooler it was until I switched
the haptics off and heard how utterly
neutered the games so without it like it
was like kind of sad similarly hyper
sense adds a lot of impact to action
scenes and movies or just about any
movie trailer
warbled there were however lots of times
during our testing when hyper sense was
either ineffectual or downright
distracting it adds almost nothing for
example to Starcraft 2 where battles are
more intermittent and not all of the
unit's make noises that have low tones
and in movies or YouTube videos it can
end up registering false positives while
men are talking this is a regular drill
and then the other two are impacts ok
this is compensating or first sounds
like footsteps resulting in just kind of
an annoying muddy rumble as for music I
never thought I'd hear myself say this
about a razer audio product sarcasm
detected but music is the experience
that is the least consistent across the
board for the nari Ultimates if you're
into classical the haptics are seldom
used if at all and then with metal the
low tones are often so complex and
intermittent that hyper sense is
distracting and then even with genres
where it definitely enhances things like
hip-hop and electronic music the effect
can vary so much between songs that
within a single playlist you'll probably
find yourself wanting to go back to
synapse to tweak the knobs far more
often than you'd like an opportunity
that you'll only have by the way if you
happen to be using them on a PC because
while your profile is saved on device
and while Denari alternates with their
2.4 gigahertz dongle and included combo
cable do work both wirelessly and with a
wire PC PlayStation Nintendo switch and
more you can only adjust high percents
using the desktop software so you're
gonna have to set it and forget it
something that's easy to deal with if
you just play games but less easy to
deal with if you expect to use your nari
Ultimates for listening to music or
listening to music while you play games
while you're out and about with your
phone for example so we think most
console or mobile gamers will end up
having to choose between setting high
percents lower and having a more subtle
effect than they'd like
or setting it too high and sometimes
having to deal with too stronger in
effect and this is a problem that could
have been easily avoided if they had
just put a high percents control wheel
right on the device but they didn't
which is a total drag for console gamers
and ashamed because otherwise the
industrial design and controls are
pretty good
so the nari Ultimates use a
self-adjusting suspension style design
with big swiveling air cups that are
comfortable over long periods the plush
leather Eddie or Christians are infused
with this cooling gel that's supposed to
keep them cool and they have cutouts to
make them more comfortable to wear with
glasses though in our experience each of
these features only kind of works the
mic which is flexible and retracting to
the ear cup is serviceable but not
fantastic though I am a fan of the
helpful yet non intrusive red light that
indicates it's been muted which brings
us to the onboard buttons so you can
mute the mic with a button on the back
of the ear cup where you will also find
wheels for volume as well as game versus
voice level adjustment you'll find a
handy slot to keep the dongle and a
micro USB port really you guys that's
pretty weak especially since using high
percents and Razer chroma RGB can train
the battery in about eight to ten hours
and making matters worse it takes quite
a while to charge up enough that the
vibrating feature can be activated again
for $200 a fast charging USB type-c port
that lets me spend more time using these
wireless headphones as wireless
headphones doesn't seem unreasonable so
are they worth the money well it's
complicated for the right person the
high percent haptic feedback which I was
certain was going to be a silly stupid
gimmick that no one could possibly want
is absolutely worth the extra 50 bucks
over the noreen on ultimate which are
the same headset but without high
percents as for whether the regular
naari is worth a hundred and fifty
dollars well that's a little tougher
because you can get much better sound
for the same price and probably with
better less plasticky overall build
quality so that makes it really hard for
me to recommend these
but then there are also an utterly
unique gaming experience that is worth
trying for yourself something that can't
be said about a lot of these kind of
feature gaming peripherals so good work
Razer I guess is there someone in your
life who asks questions like how do
refrigerators work or how do I solve
this puzzle or maybe even what is
quantum computing if so I've got just
