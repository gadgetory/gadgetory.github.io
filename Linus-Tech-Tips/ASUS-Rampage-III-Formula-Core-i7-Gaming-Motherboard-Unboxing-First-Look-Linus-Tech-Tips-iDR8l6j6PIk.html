the rampage 3 f√≥rmula motherboard this
is from a Seuss's republic of gamers
line but you can tell from the suffix
formula that it's actually a value
member of their republic of gamers line
which may seem like a looks a little bit
counterintuitive but it is so the
rampage 3 extreme is the fully featured
board and the rampage 3 formula is kind
of like a little brother so this is a
core i7 motherboard that means it has
support for all the latest LGA 1366 CPUs
that means you got support for 6 cores
quad-core Xand that's pretty much all
you have on 1366 because it is an
enthusiast platform core i7 xtreme core
i7 you've got support for SLI as well as
each guy crossfire X let's have a look
at the box itself you can see a handy
little window where you've got three PCI
Express 16x plus but we'll talk more
about the board in a minute let's talk
about a couple of the key features so
you've got ROG Connect which is a USB
interface for plugging in on a different
computer to actually control BIOS
options on this particular board you've
got game first technology which is a lan
feature that it has in order to give you
the the speed you need to pone awesome I
love it as well as to give your games
priority access to any land functions
you've bought BIOS flashback so you have
two BIOS from which you can actually
choose which one you want to boot from
as well as supreme FX X Phi 2 built-in
so that's creative a solution for your
onboard sound extreme engine DIGI+ is a
powerful combination of analog and
digital design elements as well as an
included copy of Kaspersky antivirus on
the back in a typical rog fashion it has
exactly the same stuff except for oh it
also mentions 3-way SLI and CrossFireX
so that's that's a good thing I suppose
it has one additional feature list
already listed on the front so let's
have a look at the accessory package
which as you might expect that the na
roda board is quite complete you got a
3-way SLI bridge you have an IO shield
with their spongy backing on it you also
have some zip ties for cable management
you have a crossfire bridge a nice long
flexible SLI bridge you've got your cue
connectors for easy plugging in of the
front USB as well as the front panel
connectors a user's guide including a
Republic of gamers sticker as well as a
support DVD which you should throw away
and download the latest from the assist
website you have an optional fan as well
as an installation guide for it so
that's only if you're using water
cooling or a passive or a very low
airflow cooler you've got an eSATA
bracket as well as USB 2.0 there's your
cable for our OD Connect which is a
standard USB eight to a male-male cable
then you've got six SATA 2 cables two
SATA three cables please note that those
are identical other than the color there
is no physical difference between a SATA
2 cable and a SATA 3 cable in terms of
data transmission I mean I guess if you
had a really terrible quality SATA 2
cable it might not work at SATA 3 speeds
but I mean I really find that quite
quite far-fetched indeed alright so
let's get the motherboard out itself and
have a look at it as always a soos has
just nailed the aesthetic on this
particular board they're Republic of
gamers boards have really been
outstanding lately in that regard so
we've got a black PCB with black
nickel-plated as well as red accents it
looks just phenomenal so let's have a
look at the overall layout camera man's
very interested in the PWM cooling here
so you can see that that is connected
via a couple of different heat pipes so
the top one over here is connected by a
heat pipe to the bottom one
so you can see those two are sharing
their load a little bit and then you
have a heat pipe connecting the the left
PWM cooler to the Northbridge cooler
down to oh that's a separate heat pipe
itself no no it's not that's the same
heat pipe that's flattened out and then
it curves up and that connects the
Southbridge as well so let's look at the
overall
board layout we'll start with the CPU
sockets on cameraman if you can come
direct your attention over here that is
an LGA 1366 socket I already mentioned
the CPU support but I will say it again
core i7 as well as core i7 extreme
you've got your 8 pin power connector
with the optional 4 pin cover placed on
it by default up here in the top left
corner and it's ideal location
you've got your 6 Ram slots supporting
dual dual channel you're supporting dual
sets of triple channel ddr3 memory with
the quick installed memory dim slot so
you can see that there are only clips on
the one side the other side has no clips
so you're meant to insert the module
this way and then clip it down on the
one side your 24 pin connector is in its
ideal location along the right-hand edge
of the board and you've also got start
reset and all of your voltage
measurement options all along the top
right hand side of the board as well in
very very conveniently located fashion
so down here we have the Go button we
have a few cue reset up here I had
actually missed that button and then
moving down the board Kleber man still
looking at all the buttons oh he's
meeting for it to focus I see what he's
doing now ok so let's move down and have
a look at these data options so we've
got 6 SATA 2 ports remember Intel still
does not have support natively for SATA
3 on their chipset so it's actually a
Marvell chipset right there that is
running the SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
port so you do have two of those moving
down the board we have a BIOS reset
switch right here although that's far
less conveniently located than the one
that I already saw on the back panel
here's your front panel connectors as
well as you another fan connector you've
got your dual BIOS chips right there so
it's actually about to physical chips
this is not some cheap hack to physical
BIOS chips that you can switch in
between you've got your front USB ports
here as well as more of them over here
I'm not sure which of these are us being
which are not to be perfectly honest
alright we've got two more fan
connectors and I'm going to do a quick
count to the bank
before we're done here firewire port and
then let's look at the PCI Express
layout so yeah there's the X Phi 2
supreme effects cameraman is making his
way to the PCI Express slots we start
with a PCIe 1x slot up at the top here
and then we have a PCIe 16x slot now
please note there is an absence of a
slot here the assumption is that if
you're buying a republic of gamers board
and this is a good assumption that
you're probably using a dual slot
graphics card but you should be so you
don't need a slot here basically all
right then we've got another PCI Express
16x slot a PCIe 1x 16x and a PCI slot so
if you're running dual card SLI or
crossfire you're going to use these two
which means you're going to cover this
one your blank you're going to cover
this one in a PCI slot that will leave
you with two PCIe 1x slots that will
remain usable we've bought an auxiliary
molex power connector here so if you are
running up to three cards and then
you'll cover almost all of your slots
except this guy then you should plug
that in because otherwise you're drawing
just too much power out of the 24 pin
connector now let's have a look at the
back of the board on the i/o shield
we've got a purple ps2 port so that's
going to be keyboard only then we've got
one two three four five six oh it's not
one of those combo ports new it's not so
we have six USB 2.0 ports we have a
powered eSATA port as well as a regular
eSATA port and then we have a clear CMOS
switch optical audio out the rog connect
button USB 3.0 support Gigabit LAN and
those look like gold-plated 7.1 audio
connectors and before we're done I did
promise account of the four pin fan
connectors so we have one two up here by
the CPU socket and we have another one
over here on the top right of the board
we have another one down here by the
Northbridge so that is I don't know four
and then down at the bottom of the board
we find another five six seven total so
that means that you can actually control
all of those fans via the BIOS and hold
on one two three four five six seven
eight eight there's one more over here
by the 24 pin connector so you can
actually control eight fans via the BIOS
software and you can optimize them for
performance or for silence that's a
pretty cool feature and they all support
PWM there's the back of the board in
case you care thank you for checking out
