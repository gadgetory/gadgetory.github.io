notebook at pax was fire an email over
to gigabyte asking for them to send me
one it is no great secret how much I
love the razorblade 14 and small
powerful gaming machines in general and
I was floored by how much Hardware
gigabyte packed into the new ARS x3 but
after my experience with the brics
gaming and it's impressive looking specs
that were spoiled by thermal throttling
I told myself not to get too excited
until I'd actually seen it perform so
here we go
welcome to my review of the ARS x3 from
gigabyte corsair gaming RGB keyboards
feature precision Cherry MX RGB key
switches for sixteen point eight million
color perky backlighting for virtually
unlimited customization click now to
learn more the first hint that this
device has some serious horsepower under
the hood is the included massive 180
watt power brick I wish they'd include
something a little bit more elegant like
what razer does but while you will have
to carry it it's not the thing you'll
actually be spending your time
interacting with so let's move on to the
good stuff the exterior the x3 is as
beautiful as the first notebook gigabyte
released under the ARS brand the x7 on
the top cover we find their bird-of-prey
logo on an otherwise just plain sexy
matte black anodized aluminum finish
then on the bottom we find two as
expected somewhat tinny stereo speakers
that for as empty as they sound at least
go reasonably loud without distortion
rubber feet to keep the device in place
lots of vents to hopefully keep things
cool and Torx screws that can be opened
up to reveal the actually stunningly
upgradable interior for a gaming rig
that while not as thin as the Razer
Blade 14 is actually lighter at only one
point eight kilograms to complement the
core i7 47 HQ quad core you get eight
gigs of ddr3 with two slots total for a
maximum of 16 gigs of RAM you get a gtx
870 and
then overkill six gigs of gddr5 vram and
two m dot 2 slots each supporting up to
512 gig SSDs and capable of being
configured in RAID gigabyte keeps this
up and they may just make the x3 my next
laptop back to the outside we'll start
at the left where we find a Kensington
lock a mini DisplayPort port with
support for 4k HDMI a USB 2 port
headphone and microphone jacks and an
air intake on the front our indicator
LEDs for Bluetooth wireless Drive
activity low battery and power and then
on the right there's more ventilation an
SD card reader 2 USB 3 ports and the
power button finally moving around to
the back we are greeted by power in two
very large cooling vents jam-packed full
of heatsink fins to leverage as much of
the total thickness of the notebook as
possible and what's this a hardline land
port now we're talking I mean sure it's
a killer LAN port rather than an
intel-based one but damn it it's an rj45
connector so I'm going to give big kudos
to gigabyte for including this when the
X 3s thin and light competitors rely
solely on Wireless in fact I think the
i/o on this notebook is the best
balanced I've ever seen from a gamers
perspective I mean how many gamers use
four pole single jack headsets
Razer gigabyte includes dedicated
headphone and mic jacks also why do all
ultrabooks considers SD card slots
optional this is super handy and then
finally I personally like having a
single USB 2 port these days they offer
better compatibility especially outside
of the OS and it's not like devices like
mice are going to be bottlenecked by USB
2 anyway so gold star gigabyte for the
i/o now let's crack this baby open
there's that screen I can't believe I
made it this far and failed to mention
the thirteen point nine inch display on
this notebook is a 3k one yeah
3200 by 1800 60 Hertz matte finish
exile panel boom it delivers stunning
contrast acceptable enough back lately
that gigabyte had the cojones to ship
the notebook with a black
background by default and viewing angles
that are strongly reminiscent of the
razor blade 14 so not as good as IPS but
a heck of a lot better than TN and with
very good motion blur characteristics to
boot one thing that's missing though and
it's the first thing to really give me
pause about this notebook so far it's
touch some people won't care and quit
for them but this is Linus tech tips and
you can tell me how touch is stupid when
you've got your own YouTube channel with
blackjack and hookers I've gotten used
to touch and particularly on windows 8
going back to not having it is quite an
adjustment for me I also didn't find the
robustness of the hinge mechanism
particularly awe-inspiring but this has
become a common complaint of late with
screens getting so thin and on that
somewhat complaining note let's head
into the mixed bag that is the keyboard
and touchpad the keyboards white
backlight is strong or less strong or
off if you prefer and the layout is
mostly pretty good with long shifts back
spaces etc 5 programmable G keys with 5
sike little profiles and support for
text input Mouse input and macros and
only the Gympie for no apparent reason
arrow keys for me to really complain
about but typing on it didn't feel good
in spite of the pretty nice slightly
slick feel to the top of the key caps
the keys have a fairly decent travel
distance but they're just kind of mushy
without satisfying tactile feedback and
they didn't sound good you know like
they sound kind of rattle e which leads
us to the trackpad not rattle e great
build quality tracks like a dream as
long as my hands are dry and oil-free
completely if either of those two
conditions are not met
the glossy surface turns into a smeary
greasy mess very quickly I would have
preferred if gigabyte had gone with a
frosted glass rather than a glossy one
but Linus you might say I won't spend
all my time typing on this thing and I'm
going to plug in a mouse or controller
to play my game anyway so how well does
it play games great question and the
answer is very well at 1080p or usually
1600
hundred for an even divider I didn't
have the display scaling issues that I
observed on the Lenovo y50 and I was
able to crank up details far more than I
expected so with that resolution out of
the way and doing a great job I decided
for the lulz to take some modern games
and dial them into what I felt were
playable settings at the native
resolution of 3200 by 1800 and was
amazed to discover that apart from not
thermal throttling I maxed out around 85
degrees on the GPU and a little over 90
on the CPU and Tomb Raider I was able to
achieve 45 to 55 inch fps across the
board with belt cranking everything down
to low and while maintaining reasonable
temperatures on the outside of the
laptop itself two of particular note is
that gigabyte avoided putting
heat-generating components directly
under the gaming zone on the keyboard so
sweaty palm syndrome was a non-issue
with this notebook it should be noted
however that it did this by cranking up
the fans fairly aggressively this is not
a quiet gaming notebook and it has a
fairly high pitched whine to the fan
noise my last comment on gaming
performance is regarding battery life as
we've come to expect even with battery
Boost frame rates tanked as soon as you
pull the plug but the x3 at least
managed a fairly acceptable battery life
in my sort of stare at the fire in
Crysis 1 test so while it's not
revolutionary it at least holds its own
against other similar sized notebooks
although I'd like to see someone cram
this kind of power into a smaller area
within a larger notebook strap a huge
battery to it and see what we end up
with there alright so up until now I've
focused really only on gaming but what
about daily use well that's where things
get a little bit hairy again I have very
mixed feelings about 4k even on desktop
size displays due to poor scaling and
windows that causes me to have to choose
between either impossibly small UI
elements or blurry text and applications
that don't scale properly and this is
still very much a problem the reality is
though that unless
three K and four K Hardware starts
showing up these issues won't get
addressed so I'm glad someone is taking
the first step and I'm sure folks who
invest in an X 3 will be patting
themselves on the back when all these
issues are behind us and they're
enjoying their super crisp looking
display but it is something that they're
going to have to deal with for now
speaking of dealing with for now
shopping at the local grocery store for
your razors something that you shouldn't
have to do fighting with someone to undo
the lock and key and bring it out for
you and then you go to the counter and
pay for everybody have to deal with all
that crap Dollar Shave Club is the much
faster much easier and less expensive
way to shop for razors monthly basically
all you do is sign up for the club and
they will ship you your razors once a
month for just a few bucks they also
have other high-quality bathroom
supplies including their one wipe
Charlies which are peppermint scented
butt wipes for men always makes me a
little uncomfortable talking about those
razors is easy though you know razors
everyone uses actually razors are kind
of gross too because you've got all this
like other people's used hair on them
which is why you shouldn't share razors
which is why everyone should have their
own subscription to Dollar Shave Club
you can also get their dr. Carver shave
butter which goes on clear so you can
see what you're doing and I think that's
pretty much all I have to say about that
thanks Dollar Shave Club for supporting
Linus tech tips and for that matter
small content producers like us
everywhere it's great to see companies
that care about supporting smaller guys
as opposed to blowing all their money on
developing razors with you know
vibrating handles yes thank you Dollar
Shave Club because without you small
content creators like me wouldn't have
all these piles of SD cards to use
whenever you know they need to record
things and their camera people don't
bother to put any of them into the
actual camera so we run out in the
middle anyway the point is Dollar Shave
Club go-to dollarshaveclub.com / - to
start saving time and saving money and
to support Linus tech tips
so we can have more SD cards that we
don't use guys thanks for watching like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it leave a comment letting
me know if your feelings are more
complicated than this or this check out
the link in the video description to
support us there's of course the Dollar
Shave Club link there's also a link to
where you can buy a cool t-shirt like
this one give us them on to contribution
or change your amazon bookmark to 105
Philly eight code so we get a small
kickback whenever you buy piles of SD
cards that you don't use</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
