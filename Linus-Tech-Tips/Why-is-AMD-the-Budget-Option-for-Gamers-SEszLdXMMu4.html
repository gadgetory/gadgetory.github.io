to be that if you want to save a buck
and build a gaming rig AMD is the way to
go but what does that mean exactly like
aim DS for poor people who can't afford
Intel well at a very high price point
you could make that argument I mean
remember we're talking about gaming here
where Intel's top spec chips do
outperform AMD's but most people aren't
buying top-of-the-line computers and
that doesn't mean that they're poor it
just means they want a good value so we
designed today's challenge to find out
if AMD's performance deficit can be
overcome by its advantages which include
less expensive CPUs and motherboards and
included overclocking support all the
way up and down the rise in lineup and I
think you guys are going to find our
results really surprising no matter what
you were expecting I certainly did
eleven hardware sponsors are giving away
a slew of awesome prizes at random to
people voting in the build sheet NK
challenge so head over to builds GG
today for your chance to win so we're
gonna start things off right with a
head-to-head build off basically here's
how it's gonna go down using PC part
picker Anthony and I are each going to
put together the best build we can one
for each side with a budget of 750 US
dollars before taxes and shipping and a
big list of requirements we both want to
be able to overclock if not now then
later on we're both gonna need at least
one terabyte of storage and 8 gigs of
RAM and we both want at least a 500 watt
power supply with 80 plus bronze
certification so here we go then
first order of business is going to be
the CPU both of us know that we need
something reasonably powerful but
because of the overclocking stipulation
Anthony's going to get a big discount by
going with AMD because all desktop
rising processors are unlocked
thankfully the core i3 83 50k isn't too
expensive
also because AMD's mid-tier chipset
enables overclocking I can save money by
going with a B Series motherboard not
the cheapest one mind you because
overclocking is a consideration I'll
want a board with decent VRMs of course
my K Series chip also doesn't come with
a cooler which means I need to drop you
yet more of my precious budget on one of
those wow this is starting to add up for
really quickly knowing Anthony's going
for higher speed memory I can claw back
a bit of my budget by going with a less
expensive kit unfortunately that does
mean that the per thread performance gap
is going to close between us which is
something I can't really afford pardon
the pun for storage this Hitachi
1 terabyte drive is a no brainer there
are cheaper one terabyte drives but none
are 7200 rpm I'm also gonna pick up this
DIY PC case and a Roseville arc 650 watt
power supply it's not the best quality
unit but for $40.00 it's 80 plus bronze
and has a three-year warranty
onto the graphics card I really don't
have much money left to spend here and
this is probably where I'm gonna get
killed I can only hope that Anthony
isn't very good at putting together
value builds okay you just about ready
there Linus it's been a while yeah I
think I'm done you good yep and with
that our builds are complete so pencils
down time to compare ooh yeah I think I
win well okay it's not about whether you
win or lose it's is it more about how
you play the game oh okay well I think I
played better gaming so we've got a lot
in common
we're both only spending 20 25 bucks on
our cases yeah Rose will power supply
you got the hard drive as well the
graphics cards gonna kill me honestly I
could almost afford an RT X except I
couldn't write and I've only got a
quad-core processor cause your CPU is
only five bucks more even though I'm
only a quad-core but like it's a faster
quad-core than it is than the rising
cores are so it's the $45 on the board
and the cooler that are costing me that
GPU upgrade
yeah the RAM is cheaper too yeah I
probably should have gone dual channel
it didn't make that much of a difference
so here's the thing requiring
overclocking capability isn't really
fair in the sense that Intel can deliver
much better performance per dollar
outside of their k-series overclockable
chips even if those limitations are
entirely their own doing so let's
actually work together then and modify
the blue team build to try and get a
little bit closer to that bang for the
buck shall we sure basically CPUs gotta
go yeah and I think you can get like an
8400 out of that 8400 is such an
underrated CPU sixty-four reviews is all
it's got the value was entirely there
yeah that's outstanding
so that means I don't need a cooler any
other you
that I don't need as e-series board
anymore
yep you can go with a I would say P 360
so now you should be able to afford the
2060 okay so with the Intel build now
running a more reasonable B Series
chipset because we can't overclock
anyway we're able to get both a more
powerful CPU and GPU so that six cores
now end in our TX 2060 so with this
modification then our specs actually
even out significantly but it's worth
noting that any edge the Intel system
gets in its stock performance in games
may be offset at least partially by
AMD's unlocked core multiplier and
higher thread count depending on the
workload so now what well why don't I
throw a couple of benches together and
see if I can't figure out what the
performance difference is between these
oh so we're not just gonna do this
theoretical we're gonna build these rigs
and see what happens yeah I like it
after an afternoon of prep our
performance results came out to be
pretty interesting as you can see our
first builds are really different but
while our AMD machine is way out ahead
thanks to its powerful RT X 2060
graphics card Intel does pull up close
in some less GPU bound cases and in csgo
even manages to pull ahead though it
should be noted that this game is
notorious for performing much better on
Intel when we overclocked our first
builds all those extra threads on AMD's
processor added up to a lot of oomph
and since our graphics card was a little
bottlenecked at stock this translated to
a nice increase in gaming performance so
AMD beat out Intel by about 6% overall
with that said our overclocked Intel
machine on average beat our stock AMD
systems our TX numbers not bad for a GTX
60 and 60 moving along we've got our
adjusted builds so remember our AMD
machine saved a few bucks on the
motherboard and our Intel one jumps up
to a core i5 8400 and our TX 2060 but
loses its overclocking capability so
here Intel is top dog for performance
neither machine overclocked but then
gets edged out by our overclocked AMD
machine this is proving to be a much
closer race than we could have possibly
hoped and it gets even more interesting
when we look at the value proposition
for our original configurations despite
very decent performance levels and a
lower price tag the Intel build ends up
delivering poorer performance per dollar
than our AMD won both at stock speeds
and when both of them are overclocked
now our Intel build ended up a little
bit cheaper though because we had some
budget left over just not enough for
anything that would impact performance
like an RT X upgrade so if you were
building this box at home and didn't
have a hard and fast seven hundred and
fifty dollar limit the story might be a
little bit different but we're operating
within the constraints that we set and
amb came out ahead at this price point
as for the adjusted builds this puts
Intel's value at the closest to parity
out of all of our comparisons but then
when we compare it against our AMD
builds overclocked numbers it again gets
edged out and I guess it's that that
word that keeps coming up edged that is
kind of the most interesting takeaway
here so as it turns out go figure
neither AMD nor Intel's product
management departments are staffed by
sea sponges and every rig from both
teams regardless of overclocking ended
up being within about 5% in terms of the
performance per dollar like it's almost
like AMD's pricing structure is designed
to maximize their profits while slightly
undercutting Intel but not so much that
they have to react and drop their
pricing and like Intel's is designed to
demand a small premium because of their
more recognizable brand truly
fascinating isn't it I actually I
honestly did not expect it to be this
close though like when we set out for
this what was the what was your
expectation I was expecting AMD does
Capri
Intel at the low end and then when we
you know adjusted them I would expect
Intel to cream AMD because it's roughly
the same price and and you had six cores
of more gaming optimized single threaded
performs like it yeah so I don't know we
we ended up with a result that wasn't
what we were going for but we certainly
had a lot of fun with it and let us know
in the comments below if you'd like to
see any other of these kinds of value
analysis pieces in the future maybe at
different price points or looking at
different components of the system
rather than just the CPU speaking of in
the future this message from our sponsor
used to be in the future but now it's
now get your fix on with I fix its new
line of Marlin screwdrivers each fixed
blade screwdriver features an ergonomic
knurled rubberized handle with a swivel
top plus a black oxide coated tip so it
hangs on to tiny screws with a steel
grip the set case lid is held in place
magnetically and can be used as a
sorting tray which is super handy and
it's manufactured in Germany and backed
by I fix its lifetime warranty so even
in the event that something goes wrong
you can contact the folks over there and
they will get you fixed up in a hurry
it's almost like that they fix things
like for a living we've been using
iFixit stools for years and they make
building pcs and repairing electronics
around the office a breeze or at least
as good as it can be sometimes it's very
frustrating so get the Marlin
screwdriver set for $24.99 and
ifixit.com forward slash - at the link
in the video description so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
I don't know who could dislike it
because like there wasn't really yeah I
don't think fanboys lost
yeah like Intel can't be like oh I am
B's so stupid but if you liked it hit
like get subscribed or maybe consider
checking it where to buy the stuff we
featured in the video description also
link down there's our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join ok someone someone can be upset</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
