shield series uninterruptible power
supply from op to UPS we in particular
have the 2250 so this is the 1200 watt
yes
absorb that you guys 1200 why you P s
from this particular line and what is it
for okay emergency backup for home and
office is offering it as perfection is
the best value it actually isn't that
expensive compared to their was they're
durable series one that we looked at
before so this is more for home and
office use whereas the other one for
suggested uses had things like medical
equipment so that should give you some
idea of the class of product this is
more consumer and small business whereas
the other one is more big business
friendly the other one have advanced
features like being able to hook up an
external battery for you know hours of
on time whereas this doesn't really have
that kind of thing okay ideal solution
for multiple applications PC and Mac
workstations number gateways security
surveillance and video recorders POS
systems and ATM machines some stuff they
can't go down but if it does go down
people don't die okay
ts series offers useful friendly
installation in peace of mind operation
okay
wide range AVR automatic voltage
regulator this is good because it will
actually keep your parts lasting longer
electrical noise filtration protection
from electrical surges spikes and
lightning remote control connected
equipment and energy savings functions I
advanced battery management okay all
this is pretty straightforward let's go
ahead and get this opened ups ups is our
heavy this one is heavy I usually have
trouble getting them out of the box
we're probably gonna do is we're gonna
turn off the camera I try and get it
extracted so after we have a look at the
packaging using a nice thick soft foam
which is excellent and good to see
especially because these things are so
heavy that when you ship them around it
would be a disaster if they you know
broke the foam inside and like knocked
around and destroyed themselves okay it
comes with a nice big power cord and
let's have a look at the other
accessories really quick here
comes with a USB cable so again this is
another difference between that more
commercial industrial model that came
with a serial cable and didn't even work
without an optional software download
with USB like it was yeah it was meant
for serial whereas this one doesn't even
come with a serial cable is more
consumer-oriented model it also comes
with a phone cord oh yeah that's right
well no not just I'm just making I'm
just saying that it is useful
the reason the phone cord is useful is
because it actually will prevent power
surges from frying your phone in theory
power does actually go through the phone
line so there you go alright ups
monitoring software Sentinel revision v
1.5 works with any OS pretty much like
ever on the Windows platform okay cool
all right this one is also more
consumer-friendly looking so it has
actually oh yeah the other one the other
ones here so instead of looking like a
piece of equipment from the 80s I'm not
gonna be able to move this so I'm just
gonna kind of turn it there you go
it looks like more like sleek you know
the kind of thing that you can have next
to your gaming rig that wouldn't look
that out of place sort of sort of look
to it okay so there's your power button
there's your indicator LED this one
doesn't have a front display however you
can use the software to monitor a
variety of the features here is a brief
instructional guide on how to do a
variety of things including how to turn
it on which is critical if you can't
figure out how to turn it on then you
won't have much success using this
product also unlike the industrial level
product it doesn't have a cooling fan
which again makes it more suitable for
home use because let me tell you the
cooling fan on the durable Series one is
pretty loud more at place in a server
room than in an office so here's our
input here is our UPS output so you've
got up to four things that you can plug
in so you know there's your computer
your monitor your I don't know fax
machine and your you know
like iPhone charger now you probably
don't need to charge your iPhone doesn't
matter if the power goes out your iPhone
can just stop charging it's okay
remember guys the point of a UPS is like
lightening strikes or you know something
explodes the power goes out something
bad happens and there's some kind of a
surge or some kind of damage that can be
done to the equipment on the other side
this guy takes care of that so as soon
as something bad happens 8 it is keeping
the voltages constant which is better on
your equipment it is less stressful on
the power supplies in your equipment
whether it's a computer power supply or
whether it's like a passive power supply
doesn't matter it's less stressful to
have a constant healthy voltage being
fed to it and it also serves to switch
to battery backup in the event that
something goes terribly wrong which will
keep things from shutting down without
without correctly shutting down without
closing or software saving all your work
this kind of stuff can save your bacon
so there's your USB port oh UPS output
that's sort of interesting
does it have fiber I'm not sure what the
difference is between this UPS output in
this UPS I would put it but there you go
okay so rj45 slash RJ RJ 11 in and out
so you can either power surge protect
your Ethernet or your phone line but I
don't really see any reason why you
would want to surge protect Ethernet
unless yeah I can't really think of a
reason for that so the phone lines
probably the more relevant one and I
think that pretty much covers it don't
forget guys lots of things can go wrong
especially when the power goes out
whether you're flashing a BIOS you know
updating any particular firmware you
should always be plugged into a UPS
because it'll buy you at least a few
minutes you know even five minutes can
be the difference between finishing
flashing a BIOS and just having one
flake out and you slick and I even had
the power go out here in the tech tips
room when we were flashing a BIOS once
and the only reason I don't know if that
board's handy or anything
the only reason that board didn't brick
was because it had a dual BIOS feature
that had a hardware switch we were able
to just switch over to the other BIOS
and flash that one once the power came
back on so UPS's can save your bacon I'm
a huge advocate and they are as valuable
as they are heavy and they are very
heavy thank you for checking out my
