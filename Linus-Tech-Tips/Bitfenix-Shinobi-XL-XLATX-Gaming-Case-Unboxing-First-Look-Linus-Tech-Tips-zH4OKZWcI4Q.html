with the twist this is the shinobi XL
which stands for extra-large
actually I don't know that it does it
might stand for XL ATX because while
that does mean that the case is probably
extra large whoa it's really big huh
okay and that's what yeah I said wait no
okay backing it up um XL ATX is a longer
than longer than standard form factor so
that is to say that it is you know about
two inches longer than you're probably
used to and sometimes wider here we have
a manual and let's go ahead and you know
what let's look at the box before we
open this out there we go soft touch
surface treatment we're used to seeing
that on BitFenix cases it feels nice
looks nice for super speed USB 3.0 ports
including or in addition to we'll think
about it later
they're super charge port which is cool
delivers up to 2.5 amps of power on the
front USB which means you can charge
anything you want
quickly tool free design a flex cage
hard to scratch which rack which means
you can go this way that way or remove
the whole thing entirely XL ATX
compatibility and superior water cooling
support so this case supports up to two
triple 120 or 360 millimeter as the kids
call them today radiators natively I am
glad to see a manufacturer taking or
actually a lot of manufacturers these
days taking water food so seriously
because while it's all fine and good to
be able to put one 360 millimeter
radiator water cooling guys are like the
kings of more is better so two 360 male
radiators must be better uses a closed
cell phone nice soft foam happy to see
this previous 15 s cases I've seen
tacked in a hard foam which I do not
I definitely like to see closed cell
phone because in Canada our country is
really big and cases and systems often
have to travel very far but an inch of
padding by the way I often have to
travel very far before they reach their
intended destination so what that means
that if you got if you've got a hard
phone you might be in trouble because
it'll survive the first drop for sure
and it might survive the second drop but
I can tell you now it's probably not
gonna survive the third drop because
once it breaks the structural integrity
is not as good as it was before it was
broken which stands to reason so let's
have a look at the aesthetic of the case
one two three four five five and a
quarter inch base beautiful brushed
metal BitFenix logo here on the front it
has what they're calling a classic
shinobi look and I would agree that the
shinobi look is very classic with clean
lines a nice square overall design
although I don't know if you can call
the shinobi a classic case just yet
because it hasn't been on the market
very long although it's probably on its
way here on the front we've got our
charging part so there it's marked for
the battery and it's color-coded yellow
we've got four super speed USB 3 ports
headphones microphone power and reset
that's a nice recessed reset so it's not
that easy to hit by accident learn how
to get this off it's gotta be a way to
do it alright let's move around to well
I guess the sides are pretty similar
you're not gonna need to see the other
side because it pretty much looks a
little something like this so you've got
your top piece this is using the soft
touch the front bezel is using soft
touch this is just a powder coated metal
finish although it's not bad and then on
the back see this is what used to pass
for water cooling ready now the
manufacturers including BitFenix for
this particular case are actually
building in mounting space for radiators
it used to be there like yeah you can
you know run into a radiator outside of
your case because someone actually does
that no they don't so this is not water
cooling ready but it's there in case you
actually do want to use it and you could
even run two separate loops so I guess
that's kind of convenient if you're one
of those guys who does run chill liquid
for example I have done it so I
shouldn't say nobody does it but it's
just
more rare this is actually very solid
this is a big side panel so you have to
use a fairly thick grade of metal in
order to have it have very very little
flex like that you guys see that not bad
at all I mean this is a slightly more
expensive case then I've typically
looked at in the past from BitFenix so I
guess it stands to reason that the
overall build quality and the features
are a little bit sort of higher grade
but yeah well I'm really impressed so
far to be to be completely blunt with
you guys why don't we start with I'll
start at the side okay so we have our
cables we have em okay at least it uses
a nice soft rubber so it's easy to fix
there we go we have our cables right
here so there is your power to front USB
3s your front audio as well as your
front panel connectors and your front
USB 2 and 4 other more different front
USB 2 so that's how you have additional
power presumably for that charging port
alright we've got him
lots of cable management grommets so
regardless of what kind of a motherboard
you want to put in here you can see
we've actually got a ATX mounting holes
way over here we've got standard
mounting ATX mounting holes right here
and then up to e ATX with three four
five six seven eight nine PCI slots all
the way down to here supports a standard
power supply with for all these are
really nice these are nice high quality
rubber nice rubber mounting points that
hold it a little bit off the bottom of
the case filtered intake and it can go
up to pretty much as long as you want
before bumping into anything and not
fitting any more in the back we have a
120 or 140 millimeter fan whichever you
prefer although it comes with a bit
phoenix specter 120 mil up in the top we
have what is hold on can't remember
include two 230 yeah so we have a 230
millimeter cooling fan although you can
see if I tip it even more the mounting
holes are available here for that triple
radiator so that's where that's going to
go and there's actually a fair amount of
space between this
on the top of the motherboard which is a
bit of a rarity these days even though
by the time you put a radiator and fans
on it you're gonna need that space so
it's good to see that BitFenix has gone
ahead and included that I don't see yet
how to take off this top piece although
I really would break it okay so
basically we've got the 230 mil fan here
we've got the 360 mil here you've got oh
look at this you've got access to the
front panel here so if you wanted to I
don't know
rewire something or something then you
could you could do that let's go ahead
and put that back on there we go okay uh
harddrive mounting so one two three four
five six seven these are compatible with
three and a half as well as two and a
half inch drives they have some flex to
them although my experience leads me to
believe that they're probably a lot more
sturdy once you actually put a drive in
them the other 230 mm fed is here on the
front this is a Spectre fan bye guys
bear in mind these are reasonably high
quality fans is sorry so that one's in
the front you can actually take this
whole cage and you can undoing the
screws in the bottom I think yes I'm
doing the screws on the bottom you can
actually turn the whole thing 90 degrees
if you want if you don't need the
additional space over here so the
benefit of that is you're gonna get a
slightly better airflow through and
between the drives versus if you have it
see this way see how it kind of blocks a
lot of the airflow so that way it'll
only be blocked where you actually have
drives installed however this has a
nicer aesthetic in my opinion because
you have more options in terms of
routing the wires to your drives so I
personally would leave it the way it is
but it's nice to have the option and
it's nice to be able to take it out
entirely I mean if you decide you want
to turn this case into a modding project
of some sort you've actually got a lot
of flexibility in here because it's
basically a fairly plain a fairly clean
looking box with a lot of space inside
it you can contrast that with something
like the cosmos 2
where it's a very large case but because
of the way they've compartmentalized it
it's mostly useful for a very specific
type of user a very specific type of
build whereas this was more flexible but
maybe fewer features off the hop okay so
here's your tool list mounts these are
cool this yeah pretty much it
let's go ahead and turn it around and
see what we got in terms of room for
cable routing because yeah it's fine and
good to design a case that can hold all
this hardware but if you can't reach
anything with the cables look at all
that space so that is look at that we've
got like looks like over an inch of
space behind the motherboard tray for
routing cables that is outstanding and
you can also see that by the time you
install a drive here you're still gonna
have like a very very reasonable amount
of room behind your drives to route your
SATA cables to route your power cables
down to where they need to go which is
to the power supply or over to your
motherboard
without any hassle so I'm glad to see
that reasonably big CPU cut I wouldn't
mind it seeing something a touch bigger
and could've come over here but in its
place but phoenix has included securing
points for routing cables behind the
motherboard tray cannot emphasize enough
how important these are because these a
lack of these is half of the reason that
you'll often end up in a situation where
you are trying to close your other side
panel and you can't because the cables
are all crossing each other every time
you let go of them so if you can tie
everything down you can often have a
much tinier build because of it so let's
see what we've got in terms of included
accessories here is a harness is kinda
neat so it's a five and a quarter to
three and a half inch bay and then it
also includes a fan mount I'm assuming
includes a two and a half inch drive
mount that's for sure as well as three
and a half inch drive mount that looks
off a lot like a family so I guess you
guys can let me know if I'm wrong or
right ok
okay so inside here we've got hey look
at this
more like cable management stuff with
little double-sided tapes and these are
actually relatively long zip ties which
may seem trivial but it really does seem
like a lot of case manufacturers cheap
out on the zip ties they give you ones
that are like this long and you're like
okay so I can like wrap that around one
cable one ATX cable speaker as well as
all of the mounting screws and general
whatnots
you will need so thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look or
overview or whatever you want to call it
of the BitFenix shinobi XL so far I
would say that given the price point
it's coming in at and guys don't ask me
the price I almost always put a link in
the description of the video so you can
click and you can see the price and
either Canadian dollars or US dollars so
there you go
but given the price point I'd say it's
very very competitive feature wise with
a lot of the other stuff out there so
