have released a slew of new graphics
cards promising better performance at in
some cases lower prices but which P
should you choose Polaris or Pascal and
how much should you spend let's try to
answer those questions

bear for free check out the link in the
video description so we're going to
start as usual with the TLDR
if you're building a budget box or
upgrading an existing machine you can't
go wrong with this power color radeon RX
462 gig video card that we found at a
hundred and ten bucks the RX 460
delivers smooth frame rates at full HD
1080p in popular titles like League of
Legends dota 2 overwatch and csgo
without having to compromise on
graphical quality settings stepping up
to the $200 price point this EVGA GTX
1063 gig is a standout deal on the green
side of the fence with a Seuss's Strix
rx 474 gig
holding down the fort for team red these
cards will perform on average very
similarly and pack enough horsepower for
Triple A games at high details 1080p
with PCM our approved frame rates for a
little more oomph this sapphire rx for
84 gig costs 15% more than those but is
also about 15% more powerful making it
an equally good value if your piggy bank
can handle the pain now there's an
unusual void right now in the next price
range I would normally address 300 to
350 dollars it's populated almost
exclusively by overpriced rx4 80s and
GTX 10 60s I mean they're good cards and
thanks to their extra horses and onboard
memory they're capable of driving solid
gaming experiences at higher resolutions
like 2560 by 1080 ultra wide and 2560 by
1440 but I wouldn't pay more than 260 to
270 dollars for them given the
availability of this gigabyte win force
1066 gig and this sapphire rx 488 gig
which leads us finally then into
enthusiasts class cards that cost $400
or more where my pick is
this EVGA gtx 1070 Super clock the FPS
per dollar number is a little lower than
our other cards but the 10 70s value is
also not bad
it delivers 80% of the performance of
its bigger brother the GTX 1080 enough
to run almost anything at 4k with some
tweaking but at a price that's closer to
65% as much thanks to its lower-cost
ddr5 memory and cut-down processor there
are slightly cheaper GTX 10 70s but I
felt like the EVGA tax of 10 bucks was
worthwhile in this case because there is
more to life than frames per second but
that's a subject for the next portion of
this video TL DR is over where I'll
explain the methodology that I used to
select these cards this is my
spreadsheet as some of you understood
when I did my little rant on low-end
video cards and why nobody should buy
them for gaming value by definition is
not determined by price alone but by a
ratio of price to reward a meal that
costs half as much but contains a
quarter as much food is cheap but it is
not a good value especially if you're
still going to be hungry when you're
done so back to my admittedly imperfect
spreadsheet it was designed to help me
use performance numbers from trusted
review sites around the web to calculate
which cards will give me the best value
or the most FPS per dollar across a
variety of games and resolutions the
more I add the more meaningful the final
average numbers become here's how it
works I could use exact FPS values like
42 FPS if I was pulling all of my data
from one source where I knew that every
game was tested with the same
methodology and the same settings but
since no single review covers every
possible scenario I've opted instead to
normalize to a last generation card
whose drivers are mature and that was
well
sampled making it a great point of
comparison for both modern flagships and
mid-range solutions the GTX 980
reference design so when I enter exact
FPS values for both the card I'm
investigating and the GTX 980 here I get
a relative performance number which I
fill in to my spreadsheet this allows me
to compare cards across different review
sites or even cards that haven't ever
been directly benchmarked against each
other with from some spot checking
anywhere from two to three percent
margin of error for cards that have
never been benchmarked against the GTX
980 like the 750ti
I used a card that has been benched
against both as an intermediary the RX
460 though this method is not ideal and
I approximated a lot of other stuff as
well only a small fraction of the cards
available for sale have ever even had a
professional review done but thanks to
GPU boost 3.0 especially actually we're
more limited by power limits imposed by
Nvidia and AMD than by factory
overclocks anyway these days so I've
approximated most non reference cards to
perform pretty similarly which won't
necessarily be true but as you can see
here adjustments to price have a far
larger impact on our value calculation
than the kinds of single-digit
performance differences that you'll
typically see from one DT X 1080 to
another so yes I know I said it already
but it merits repetition here so the
entire comment section isn't full of
people pointing it out this method is
imperfect and would require either many
many days of additional manual data
entry if I wanted to go beyond relying
so heavily on guru 3d for example whose
reviews are linked in the excel sheet by
the way or ideally some kind of fancy
custom statistical analysis software and
it also ignores a lot of factors here
are the ones I could think of in no
particular order multi-gpu
you want to shop for an SLI or crossfire
setup they would each need to be added
individually for every pair or more of
cards have fun I'm not doing
to characteristics like board length
display connectors or the required
physical plugs that might affect
physical compatibility with your system
3 warranty there is a huge range of
policies not just in terms of the
coverage period but in terms of whether
resale overclocking and/or physical
modification is permitted this is
critical for folks who plan to water
cool for cooler style and quality
aesthetics aside though some people care
a lot about that for some configs a rear
exhaust blower design might be better to
avoid recycling hot air to cool other
components while in a better ventilated
case and open air coolers additional
performance for the GPU itself will
result in tangibly better performance in
games consult your case manufacturer if
you're not sure oh and double ball
bearing fans are probably worth a couple
bucks for a card you plan to keep for a
long time 5 frame buffer size now
generally speaking bigger frame buffer
cards end up underpowered before the
extra ram is necessary but there are
some exceptions someone who is really
into Skyrim texture mods will definitely
want to grab an 8 gig rx / 80 versus a 4
gig one regardless of what the
performance per dollar metric looks like
because vram is one of those things that
doesn't affect performance at all until
you run out of it and the card is
swapping textures out to system memory
and at that point everything goes south
faster than all the canadian birds and
seniors do in the wintertime 6 driver
improvements over time
and the features that are difficult or
impossible to quantify shadowplay and
freesync
are examples of things that I care about
but maybe someone somewhere cares about
trueaudio
or the automatic game settings
optimization and GeForce experience your
mileage may vary here and that can
definitely affect your decision
especially when you're looking at red
team versus green team 7 sanity checks
this gtx 950 at 130 dollars could look
like a great value for 4k gaming with
its similar FPS per dollar number but
even though this 1080 founders edition
costs $700 huh it's 47 FPS versus 5 FPS
might be a factor here for you if you
actually want to play games so
consulting actual reviews for raw
performance numbers is still part of the
process leaving us to eight and perhaps
the most important actual availability
just because you can Google some super
cool card if no retailers in your region
carry it then you're kind of out of luck
that is to say unless the retailer ships
worldwide like mass drop though does
cost a bit extra if you're not familiar
with mass drop I'm going to run you
through the basic concept mass drop
takes a whole bunch of people who want
to buy a thing and then a whole bunch of
manufacturers who want to sell a lot of
things and they put them together the
community says hey we'd love to buy that
product X but it's like expensive if a
whole bunch of us agreed to buy it do
you think the price could drop a little
bit you know volume discount and mass
drop goes to the authorized distributors
or even the manufacturers directly and
negotiates a better price if a bunch of
people want to buy or in certain cases
they even have manufacturers produce
special products just for them like the
k7 xx headphones that we're featuring
today and this is the same ones that I
reviewed last year so they were
configured by mass drop and manufactured
by AKG they're open backed headphones
with large cushiony ear cups that
feature a flat wire voice coil a genuine
leather headband memory foam ear pads
with velour coverings that a two-year
warranty covered by mass drop and what
kind of a price do you get well the war
buy the better he gets because that's
how mass drop works so check out the
link in the video description so thanks
for watching guys that this video sucked
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or check out the link to where to
buy the cards that we recommended in the
video description
so linked in the description is our
merch store which has cool shirts like
this one and our community forum which
you should totally join now that you're
done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what to watch next so
