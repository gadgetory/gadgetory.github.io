which means time for another livestream
today it's gonna actually be a pretty
fun one I'm just gonna go ahead and my
Wi-Fi why is this off so you guys might
remember dr. Zaber maker of the original
century this like super small basically
console sized case that was able to hold
a shockingly powerful system inside it
and they actually reached out to us just
kind of randomly what about a week ago
or something like that Jake does that
sound right I think it was about a week
or two ago anyway they're following it
up with a century 2.0 and we figured
yeah be a lot of fun for us to do a
build in it so we actually posted a poll
on YouTube for members only like channel
members and asked them if we should do
our build in the like classical gray
version of the chassis or if we should
use the black one instead and they said
to go with the black one I have my
doubts though because I think a lot of
them thought it was Silver's based on
the picture but actually it's got this
delightfully kind of retro gray computer
look to it that I personally really like
and no we're just doing the black all
right can you take those can take the
gray one there all right thank you
never mind we're just gonna do the gray
one also what is this DHL thing I have
no idea Oh new o-rings all right so I
have not looked at this at all I am
going in completely cold here and I'm
gonna do my best to do a super sweet
super small build that is extra powerful
so in terms of hardware we're going with
an 8700 K because that's what we had
lying around all of our ninety seven
hundred and ninety nine hundred KS are
presumably ocupado right now and then
we're going with a Titan RT X for our
graphics card we're gonna see if this
thing can handle it and then oh wow they
have stepped up their packaging game
quite a lot that is pretty cool so they
still include this little stand if you
want to set it up vertically I wonder if
they've also improved the rubber feet
here they still come off but it would be
hard for it to happen by accident now
which is nice and oh they're uh they're
kind of a harder rubber so they don't
like kind of grip too much and come off
there either actually they seem quite
they seem quite a lot better okay it's
almost like they've had a couple of
years to uh to refine their design
they're you know cool alright so now
what else we got in here
they include a screwdriver oh well it's
torques the security torques do you
really need security Torx screws to put
your computer together all right we've
got a PCI Express 16 X riser we've got a
PCI Express 16 X extender so presumably
we are going to both rise and extend a
little something like that I don't know
which cameras should be holding this up
to but whatever there you go else we got
here hey this is almost like doing an
unboxing isn't it it's fun I'm having
fun speaking of fun oh right this video
is brought to you by P I I actually
didn't even think about doing the
sponsor spot until I said speaking of I
was gonna do something else entirely
our private Internet access is the VPN
for you just head out head to LMD GG /
what is it Jake P IA I know P ia when
works so why don't you go ahead and do
that one although an show isn't for a
while yet we're doing Wang shuo Wow LAN
show LM GGG / p I a line is to strongly
recommend P ia guys you can install it
on up to five devices at a time with a
single account it's really affordable
they don't log user activity like
basically all the good things you could
ask for from a VPN P IAS got it clients
for everything you under the Sun don't
go check them out can we have a link in
the video description we have it linked
in the video description alright anyway
we've gone
our power button here which I get to
install myself this build is gonna take
a little while that much is already
clear well if the wind shows late you
guys will know why we've got looks like
a little reinforcement bracket doodad
these guys are a really small company so
everything that they're doing is just
like powder coated steel like there's no
kind of you know fancy tempered glass or
anything like that but personally I have
an appreciation for just the the
industrial industrial nough Sun it looks
to me okay to me not everyone's gonna
like it but it looks to me really clean
and I'm actually a pretty big fan so I'm
gonna put those there and hopefully not
drop them I'm gonna put these here and
I'm going to worry that I actually don't
see any instructions so they did a
really good job of safely packaging
everything but these kinds of cases
generally are a little bit more on the
complicated side to put together and I
guess I'm just gonna be guessing here oh
thank you Jake that is so nice see to
all you people who were saying that he
was useless and annoying and obnoxious
and loud and his voice socks and his
hair socks and oh my voice sorry sorry
okay so that I got one wrong so to all
of you people who were saying all of
those things
shame on you he clearly has his uses who
else would have brought me this magnetic
parts tray I'm just kidding you guys got
it understand like Jake does all kinds
of stuff around here that you probably
wouldn't expect I mean we needed like
something altered for our security for
the building and he was like custom
fabbing up a thing and he's actually
very very a very important member of the
team anyone who still works here is a
very important member of the team
because they weren't they wouldn't
that's kind of that's how business works
it's business time you know all right so
there's our top it looks like they are
still doing this apparently in
original this was for thermal reasons
but it's like do you have a way of
indicating to me what angle we're
working with here Jake or David if you
cuz if you can like throw something at
David so he knows he doesn't have to
hold still and like maintain focus then
it would be really nice for him he's
walking away he's just leaving he's done
he's gone he's gone
so they said that this here is for like
thermal reasons or like air flow reasons
it's to keep from having like a dead
zone here where warm air just kind of
sits there I don't know that I was ever
super convinced but that was that
important but apparently it made it into
rev too so they're they're sticking with
their story and then Wow other than that
it's just it's just empty so our
graphics card is gonna go right about
yeah and our motherboard is gonna go
about yeah it looks like they've moved
the power supply since last time I want
to say I even I'm not even sure where
that goes right now and all right that's
just that's just coming off so that's a
thing ah yeah I do I do actually wish
they had some some documentation
included in the box but you know what
we're going for it we are we are
straight yoloing it and newest manual on
their website it says on the side
apparently of the box all right well I
will I will go I will probably end up
having to look at that because this is a
bit complicated first why don't we go
ahead and do the things that we can do
so we got our motherboard
got our CPU just check my positioning
here take what angle are we on yeah yeah
okay Sabre comm Weber comm dot PL slash
century all right all right okay all
right I could have read the box all
right all right
rubbing it in I swear he has redeeming
qualities you guys I swear I swear it's
true it's true story
heard it from a friend of a friend of
mine okay who was it it was Jake no he's
he's the one spreading all the
propaganda all right we're gonna go with
Noctua for our cooler today
super simple cooler to install I
actually love this thing what's the l9 I
all right love it now it's not the
highest performance cooler on the Block
by any stretch of the imagination but
it's just for simple screws that bolt
through from the back and it does a
pretty good job for its size although I
wouldn't expect to be overclocking this
8700 K at all I would expect to get you
know pretty much close to full turbo but
maybe not even that it's gonna come down
really to our graphics card anyway
though we're gonna do some maybe do some
4k gaming something like that all right
so we're gonna check orientation here go
ahead and plug this into our CPU fan
header are you going to switch to the
overhead at any point Jake yeah I'm
building the computer look guys I I
swear I swear he he's she's really good
he's really good at the things that he
does that are good did you grab that m
dot too by the way Jack ooh did you grab
that m dot - from upstairs oh no are we
not doing that anymore okay
this one has games on it now you didn't
do it did you can you grab the end dot -
look guys I swear I swear he's the best
part is like oops the best part is like
Jake's parents watch our videos
sometimes like especially if he's in
them or like helping run them or
whatever else it's great so they
definitely read the comments
man honestly I wish more coolers
installed like this I understand why
with some of the bulky ones it doesn't
necessarily make a ton of sense because
then you're you've got like this
gigantic power on the other side of the
motherboard that you're you know trying
to put down or whatever like it yeah I
understand the challenges but like that
is so quick it's so clean it's awesome
now I'm just gonna grab my I love ITX
boards just something about the density
just gets me excited cuz you know when I
first got into PC building like you
wanted a high-performance system it was
in like some gigantic friggin Tower it
sounded like a hairdryer and now there's
just so much performance on this tiny
little form factor
you got your eight pin power for these
high-performance CPUs you got your USB
3.1 gen2 connector for your fancy USB 3
front panels you've got a regular USB
3.0 clasp like style connector
you've got four SATA you've got PCIe 16x
you've got two m dot 2 s one on the
front one on the back they've taken to
putting em got two slots on the back of
your motherboard now which is madness I
don't know it's just it's just awesome
hey Jake do you know if this board
support no I bet it doesn't this is a z3
70 but they've even got those new dims
now that's are up to 16 gigs unbuffered
for like small form-factor systems like
this hey Jake I had put my iFixit kit
here do you know what happened to it
oh you cleared it from the table yeah
it's still in top down you could just
like switch whenever I mean you know
we've got a live operator just you know
well no don't make a loud noise I just
mean I don't know just just like switch
between them you know just you know for
fun you know to make it dynamic you know
we're switching all right
all right okay well then then just
change the top down all right I think we
really need to do a video exploring
these uh these MDOT two heat sinks just
cause like I know that I know that other
people have looked into them but there's
so many different types of them out
there but I do wonder if you know some
of them work better than others if they
just all completely don't work at all
like I've seen some pretty crazy stuff I
think it's a gigabyte I want to say it's
either gigabyte or MSI one of them with
one of their boards must have an MSI
actually included this like GPU frickin
sized thing with this giant cooler on it
that was a quad MDOT two PCI Express 16x
card and I'm just like I look at
something like that and I go like is
there a performance advantage here why
are we doing this I got to know I got to
imagine that just kind of putting a hunk
of metal on top of it like this one that
doesn't dramatically increase the
surface area I got to imagine that
probably doesn't help much but you gotta
remember to there's different kinds of
like thermal solutions there's the kind
that's designed to dissipate heat which
if you have a giant molten like many
finned heat sink like this that's
obviously that kind and then you've got
the kind that's just designed to absorb
heat where if you had like a bursty load
for example where all of a sudden you're
you're writing a bunch of data to it and
then five minutes later it's over this
heatsink could help absorb that extra
heat and then dissipate it later once
the drive activity slows down a little
bit so it could help us kind of like a
heat buffer even if it doesn't increase
thermal dissipation a whole heck of a
lot so I don't know it seems like it's
kind of a complicated thing to try to
properly answer so I don't know how we
would develop a test that would
get all these different scenarios but
you know part of me wants to say well
all the manufacturers keep they keep
putting these you know heat sinks on
them so there must be a reason but then
we've seen stuff that they do like
putting cooling back plates on the back
of graphics cards that don't actually do
anything so hey Jake where did you get
this motherboard from oh okay
it doesn't have an i/o shield okay so
that's a little unfortunate it is B 3388
and it does not have an i/o shield you
might just have to live without the i/o
shield here folks because I don't think
we're going to be able to this is this
is the beauty of life you know this is
what's beautiful about live no I oh
she'll look at that is that beautiful or
what I'm gonna go with and or what yeah
I puked a little too I'm sorry you guys
that's okay I'm over it now all right so
I'm not gonna be using my Phillips head
screwdriver to install my motherboard
instead I will be using security Torx
what is up with that you guys that's so
weird
dr. Zaber yeah you just I just don't get
it I'm not gonna put in too many screws
here though cuz right now I'm just kind
of mapping out where things go I suspect
I still have a fair number of things to
install for the case itself like for
example this so we got to put our power
connector in oh oh that's funny I kind
of accidentally did that right I guess
because it looks like before I can even
put this in I'm going to have to put in
that motherboard screw because I'm not
actually gonna be able to can you switch
to overhead you gotta be dead can you
pay attention please
thank you oh this is actually really
complicated so when this isn't here you
can't really get at the bottom of the
back thing or with the motherboard in
you can't really get at the bottom of
the back like right in there and then
with this in you can't really get at
this motherboard screw so that's kind of
the challenge of these hyper compact
systems I guess interesting well one
thing I know we need for sure oh this is
a Phillips head oh lordy this is going
to get worse before it gets better so
I'm gonna assume that we're using a
Phillips head for this ground here I'm
just gonna go get our ground attached to
the case there we go and then we're
going to try to put our power plugs so
because the power supply is going to be
installed probably over here in the case
we're gonna have to run this extension
like this in order to actually plug our
power supply into the wall now in terms
of the way it's intended to go into this
there's a really weird gap here made
this Tesla see that though there's like
a big there's a big little gap well I
don't I don't know like all right let's
see oh wow the the Torx screws and the
Phillips ones are all threaded the same
so you have no way of knowing which ones
which unless you just look at the manual
which I think we all knew wasn't gonna
be happening here dang it you guys okay
so that's on
I'm probably doing everything wrong Jake
you got to tell me if the comments are
helping me all right all right are they
are they trying to be helpful
take that Elon thank you thank you
YouTube comments you guys fully meet my
expectations the IO shield is in the
desc
what pull the cord through the hole oh
[Laughter]
that is it hey I knew we were streaming
this live for a reason nice that's great
are we on David or overhead right now
yes what's the David that is fantastic
ha shoot guys are great what a
tremendous idea and then I think what
we're gonna do is we're gonna use black
screws for that one we're going to
assume that the black ones are for
external stuff so this is gonna go
through here there we go that explains
it gorgeous now it's still really hard
to screw this in well it's in so I am
gonna put the motherboard let's screw in
the corner here in first but now I think
we can successfully install all three or
four screws that we have to deal with in
this tiny little corner here I'm also
gonna do that ground wire now cool I'm
having fun actually really really like
small cases I don't know how well they
actually sell though that's the thing
cause like there's expansion issues you
know motherboards been
ah the motherboard is bent from stuff on
it it's heavy
oh oh yeah that cooler that cooler
tightens down really tight I was kind of
thinking of easing it off a little bit
but then I was like I don't know not to
his generally pretty good about yeah
they usually get the Intel's guidelines
right in terms of the force you're
supposed to apply to the sockets I was
like I don't know it's not like I have
never killed the CPU installing a cooler
too tight before yeah actually bored
sorry not a CPU remember that that
stupid pfSense project the old one yeah
everyone thought that I was killing the
board by like I forget what the stupid
thing they thought I was killing the
board by doing was it made no sense
right by by shaving the plastic down off
of the integrated speaker on the
motherboard
they were like obviously you're taking a
dremel to the motherboard not killing it
it's like no that's not killing it it's
plastic that doesn't do anything I don't
know how to talk to you people when
you're saying things like that so yeah
though that was not the issue the issue
was actually that the the cooler that we
had was for a slightly different one of
the other eleven five something sockets
and apparently the specs for the the
mounting pressure was slightly different
so we ran into trouble because we were
tightening it too much and it was
causing the board to flex too much and
there just wasn't enough extra tolerance
there to allow for it and it just was
destroying them so I killed like two
boards like that and it was really
frustrating because especially this
because especially because I had to mod
it in order to get it to fit so I had to
do all this work and then I finally
install it and it's like broken again
okay so that's how that goes on is that
in focus or is I just like totally out
of focus yeah oh really oh that's pretty
cool neat cool
all right so now we've got this run for
our power supply now it's time for us to
figure out some of this stuff no boy hmm
nope
you know what let's do our front USB
first so this little guy is gonna go now
this one obviously doesn't pull through
the front this one actually screws in
the way that we expect and we're gonna
follow the rules of USB my shoes are
untied ha ha oh that's very funny thank
you did you know that there's like a
conspiracy theory going around that none
of our live streams are actually live I
don't know well there was one that we
did Reese is this average video no I'm
not doing anything that wrong maybe a
little wrong but like come on let's be
fair okay yeah I know there was one we
did recently where I was in a hurry or
something and I didn't end up actually
reading any comments I don't think and
so I saw I saw a comment on it after the
fact where something was like god it's
not live just like all of their quote
unquote live streams I was like what
what do you what are you even talking
about what and we and we do we do read
comments like all the time on most of
them well I think so the logic behind
live streaming or like pretending to be
live I think is is more tied to like
like twitch streaming culture where that
can actually have a benefit like
pretending to be live is a way for you
to go on vacation but not have you're
not like have your channel affected by
by not being there but the thing is that
on YouTube if we wanted to if we wanted
to create content while we can't go live
we would just upload a video so yeah
like there's no like there's there's no
reason
do that I mean I'm sure there's folks
that are more that are more focused on
live that might see some benefit to
doing something like that but we are not
we are not one of them okay
I have to confess Jake can you be my
manual guy because I'm a little bit
confused again here you have to help
David always sing attention too tight
alright okay well I think that's how
that goes in now where did the pieces of
the case go I need to know how the
pci-express riser goes in because I'm a
little confused on the one hand there
were like a bunch of pieces here and I
was confused and then now I feel like
there's not really enough pieces and
like I need more pieces like how do you
secure this thing it's got these
mounting holes right here by the socket
but there's nothing to screw them into
also what does this do what is this
bracket for I don't know I could do that
but this is more fun I'm having fun Jake
that's what these streams are all about
just like having a good you can put a
liquid cooler in this thing how on earth
would you do that
Oh a stubby graphics card okay so yeah
last time around I believe they had
options for like mounting a bunch of
SSDs over here in the event that you had
a short graphics card but apparently now
you can put an AI Oh liquid cooler there
that's that's pretty cool so to speak I
don't think we're gonna do that cuz
we're not ready this is the bracket for
the riser
that kind of looks like it okay oh okay
no I think I see it I think I see it I
think it's like I think it's something
to do with these two holes here yeah
probably yeah it looks like that goes
there and then
the bracket or the riser rather seems
like it just kind of goes goes in there
something yeah heck yeah so then that
kind of secures it or something hmm
is it that's weird so just like this
sits there and just kind of sandwich is
it okay all right I'm into it
no I'm not checking the manual this is
this is a manual this stream fully
automatic look I'm not having this
conversation again David I don't even
think you were on the side of the people
who believed in automatic transmissions
what are you yep
no you're just trying to stir up trouble
no we're not doing a Twitter we're not
no no we're not we're not we're not
pulling people on a tech channel about
their favorite kind of car transmission
that no no we're not no we're not doing
that you can't up you can't you can't
post that you can no yep you can but you
shouldn't oh man see I take so much flak
around here because people see me like
you know burning you guys or saying
things that are mean or whatever and
yeah yeah I know I do it a lot but you
guys quite frankly are asking for it for
the most part like honestly especially
Jake like instead you see you see his
hat you see his hand in his pouch there
it's because instead of Manning the
livestream he was on his phone like hell
millennial I know I know you're not a
millennial even worse you're gonna be
the generation that the Millennials
complain about that's right
what does your generation even called do
you guys even have a name
you don't identify as having gen Z is
that what they're called Gen Z
I was before God no X was before us I
think automatic no no don't we have one
of Coursera short cable kits for this
power supply did you think to check
because this is kind of a you looked you
didn't see 100k cuz I thought we had one
of course errors first party first party
ones for this yeah okay I'm on David
okay I'm gonna try and I'm gonna try and
figure out how to install this and are
you quite sure that this power supply
fits in here sfx compatible you say okay
cuz uh it's not looking real promising
right about now oh wait oh I see it goes
on this side yeah baby
and wait am I on top down oh I didn't
see I got ahead of myself I went and I
did the front USB and now you can't
screw in the power supply once you've
put in the front USB this is why there
are manual see now you're on the manual
side this is why you never go full auto
you can't control the recoil alright
how will you control the recoil first
fire auto yeah that's not even a
question
single fire
okay they can't hear you guys so like
you guys look I'm not saying I'm not
saying you guys can't talk on the stream
I'm just saying you should probably get
miked up if you're gonna talk on the
street what the heck oh I guess they
expect me to use the screws that are
included with my power supply no yeah no
no Jake is literally not a millennial
he's like 17 or something it's funny cuz
you're not even that much Oh roaming
through the chat hey Roman I got
actually dude I gotta bug you about AMD
epic overclocking apparently that's a
thing and we want to get our hands on
one of or actually ideally a couple of
am these epic processors for some video
transcoding benchmarks so we're what no
I'm not gonna drop one of them I will be
very very careful with them
but yeah floatplane wants to take
advantage of the new 10 gig connection
that we got here at the office so we
were actually kind of thinking we would
put a transcode server here and we want
to play around with AMD vs intel versus
GPU and get some sort of real-world
numbers but I was kind of thinking would
be pretty cool to overclock the AMD CPUs
and I saw that there Bauer had a video
that he uploaded overclocking and these
epic server processors so figured it
would be pretty neat to do something
like that like Intel Xeon versus AMD
epic versus AMD epic overclocked because
what could be more epic than an
overclocked server pretty sick like just
to be clear we actually if you take is
the overclocked Intel server video up on
YouTube already or is that only on slow
plane right now
only on floatplane okay so we actually
have a video coming up where we use not
for not as like like like an over the
internet video transcode server but as
like a local video transcode server so
we have an intel-based one from gigabyte
that's actually really cool it's
water-cooled it's overclockable but the
issue is that it's not actually xeon
based so there's nothing really that
servery about it
other than that it's in a one you like
rack mountable case otherwise it could
just as easily be a random desktop board
with 7900 x in it which is the cpu that
we happened to use so by contrast Andes
epic CPUs supposedly actually have
unlocked multi multipliers
so you can actually overclock their
actual server class ones what's up to
put the rubber feet up oh yeah yeah I
wanted to do the vertical mount anyway
hold on a second actually wait what
really oh yeah if you want to put the
bottom feet on you gotta you gotta do
that beforehand oh boy um you know what
I can make that work I got this the
vertical mount just like slots into this
this dude out here so it should be fine
hello boy is that Roman giving me advice
or is that just our random in the chat
random in the chat um you know what I've
actually thought for a long time that
there is a great business opportunity
making custom IO shields because
honestly think about it it couldn't be
that hard from a picture like obviously
there'd be exceptions like some really
you know wacko motherboards in
non-standard form factors or whatever
else but for like standard ATX boards it
couldn't be that hard to figure out a
way to mostly automate the process of
taking a picture of the back of a
motherboard and you know kind of
figuring out exactly what the dimensions
are based on some known
some known items like the size of a USB
port and then I think there has got to
be a business in replacing lost i/o
shields because I personally have had
probably a probably dozens of i/o
shields that I would was like you know
what this doesn't really matter it's not
like it affects performance but boy
would I love to have a new one for this
because this is really frustrating and
if you could do it for like you know 10
15 bucks plus what's up Oh take
that off if you can do it for like 10 15
bucks plus shipping or something like
that I think people pay for it I think
there's an opportunity there why is
there a Titan arjax why wouldn't there
be a Titan r-tx what else would we put
in here you know if you if you got it
you flex it right up
yeah there's no i/o shield because it's
missing because Jake lost it actually I
we don't know that Jake lost it we just
suspect that Jake lost it that's all
okay so we're actually in pretty good
shape other than that we didn't put the
feet on but I think we could still oh
wow no the board is not coming out we
would have to take this off we would
have to yeah no this is this is a bad
time this would be a really really
really bad time to to get everything out
so yep we're vertical mounting all right
let's do some cable management here
yeah actually David if you just want to
indicate to Jake which one you want
based on you having apparently much
better game sense than him in terms of
what the viewers should be looking at
and that would look great that's fine I
always tell stories it's what I do
alright so that's in there I'm just
gonna turn that power supply on now so
that I don't forget doesn't matter as
long as I don't plug it into the wall
there's no there's no drawback to that
and we're just going to
go ahead and tuck these cables in here
all right not bad actually even though I
don't have a short cable kit this is
coming together pretty nicely power
button yeah yeah okay power button we
got this thank you thank you
I actually really like these I forget
what they're calling vandal vandal proof
or anti-vandal whatever that means I
don't understand what is vandal
resistant about them exactly but
basically you just feed them through a
nice cutout hole like this one
BOPE really clean looking and they have
these really nice ones now that have an
integrated led rings so just with two
buttons you can have your power and your
reset and then you can have your power
led and your drive activity led which
apparently I have just been informed
quite recently is not cool anymore Drive
LEDs not cool why so Jake you were the
one telling me that you that's the first
thing you unplug why on earth would you
do that you don't plug in it's not
distracting what not how else would you
okay so a couple things one how how else
no no no no hold on hold on I need a
chance to I need a chance to argue my
position here so so one how would you
know then if your drive is active and
number two is why are you watching
movies off of your hard drive or your
SSD when you should have an ass like a
real man you don't have enough stuff to
throw Nana's okay so why don't you why
don't you have enough stuff to store on
an ass like a real man I'm just I'm just
asking I'm just asking questions because
your gen Z okay this is gonna be a
little tricky to install but that's fine
we got this power switch I kind of ran
all these cables before doing the power
switch in the power led and they are
under all the cables but that's fine I
am a pretty experienced header plug or
inner although I have been known to make
mistakes from time to time
and edit them out actually it's a funny
thing like people I think feel like we
make a ton of mistakes when we do things
but I think a big part of the reason for
that is that we don't edit them out you
know we leave them in and like I don't
know it's on the one hand I think it's
like damaged our reputation sometimes
because you know we'll sometimes we'll
try things and you know sometimes it's
actually in a spectacularly stupid idea
and other times like it's honestly not
it's not really any different from what
someone at home you know might have
tried but we're you know we have you
know we're willing to put ourselves out
there and say yeah we tried this and
here was the result and if nothing else
you know the way we feel is that it like
it answers someone's question because if
we were wondering if it works then
someone somewhere was probably wondering
if it works and if it's a good idea and
now they know without damaging their
hardware so stand behind it wow that is
a great idea you know what Jake I'm
putting you on that project Phillips hue
activated by your hard drive activity
LED yeah so like it's like yeah we're
loading that game switching levels I'll
be awesome sort of so stupid like I Lyla
I love it though that's hilarious Thank
You community it's like this is why we
can never run out of ridiculous ideas
because every time we think we're close
I'll just like go on the forum or fire
up Twitter and people do like can you
cool a GPU by just like throwing it in
an ice cold bath like gee yeah good
question
we're cool a Macbook by putting it in a
puddle yeah or like that actually that
was my idea that was not a community
submitted idea if I recall correctly oh
yeah it worked really well but it's not
actually what I wanted to do so here's
the thing thanks Danny
so here's the thing what I had actually
wanted to do for that project where what
we what we kind of oh wow am I gonna
plug this in oh this is getting real
tight here yeah the front USB yeah no I
figured it out I'm gonna go through here
and I'm gonna go over here so what I had
actually wanted to do with that project
where we took a MacBook and basically I
think the bottom of it was unibody so I
didn't have to do anything but we pretty
much put it in a puddle of like ice
water but not fully submerged so it was
just making contact with the the back of
the the MacBook which was a passively
cooled machine and I was trying to see
if we could get a performance boost like
if there was if the hardware had more to
give if it was properly cooled and yes
it did and it actually worked really
well but the concept the original
concept for that video was something
kind of different I what I had wanted to
try to find was you know what would be
an example of something like this like
man have you ever seen like those those
really thin foil like like you know a
hot water bottle like you know you guys
know hot water bottles like those rubber
things okay and like can you can you
imagine for a second like a really thin
foil hot-water bottle okay so like like
putting camel backs maybe maybe kind of
like that yeah like a like a metal like
a metal foil like bag kind of you know
and so I've been trying to find
something like this ever since then like
periodically I'll be like look I don't
know what it's called or what it would
be called but I'm sure it exists so some
kind of a conductive layer flexible bag
that can hold a liquid that that's
watertight because everyone out there is
making notebook coolers
that frankly don't work very well
because all they can do is like blow air
at the bottom of your laptop and we've
tested them before they don't seem to
really do a whole lot of much whereas if
you could make a notebook cooler that
made physical contact with a large
amount of the bottom of your device and
that actually had cool water circulating
through it with an external radiator I
think you could get really similar
results to what we did with our MacBook
there but without actually having the
water come in contact with the laptop
which is really stupid for very obvious
reasons
and something you would only want to do
very very temporarily
we should probably revisit you know
phone and laptop water cooling it's been
long enough that we could probably take
some modern devices and yeah but the
cold plate yeah the thermal transfer
would suck and if you had something that
was more flexible than you wouldn't have
to worry about that so much so that was
that was actually the somewhat
legitimately good idea that spawned that
video at least I think it was a
legitimately good idea yeah no thermal
pad would be nasty
okay so SSD now it looks like it goes
over here this is one packed frigging
case man this is nuts yeah I put the
m-dot two in yeah thankfully because if
I was trying to figure that out now yeah
you know what forget it yeah MDOT two is
the past the present and the future now
man not even because like I think the
performance difference is especially
noticeable you know when you're firing
up apex legends or whatever the kids are
playing these days but just because it's
like it's small its compact you know
it's the future baby Hey look I can play
apex legends with the best of them they
will also be in the game while I am
there so I can play with the best of
them yeah for a short period of time
yeah yeah yeah could trout and ninja
carry me do you think so I don't know
I'm pretty bad it's pretty humiliating I
screw it's fine oh good
yeah that's right okay so was that the
whole build this actually was pretty
painless yeah what else is what else has
left I feel like I'm missing something I
really feel like I'm missing something
am I missing something
also there's like twice as many screws
as I needed it looks like there's an
entire set of silver in an entire set of
black is that just an option like is
that mentioned in the manual because so
far I haven't needed a single silver
screw like am I gonna get to a point
where all of a sudden I go oh well now I
need all the black screws the oops
is Ninja bad at Apex alright I don't
know look I don't know I don't even know
what game the kids are playing let alone
like who's good at it so I I'm hiding
behind that defense how could you expect
me to know anything if I clearly know
nothing is that even a defense GP power
yes we will need that cool Han I still
really like this case honestly they
haven't changed that much it's little
tweaks like I guess it's appropriate
that they called it the Sentry 2.0
because it's still a really really
similar internal layout but what I do
like is that it was pretty easy to
manage my cables even though I don't
have custom cable mod ones making things
even a little bit easier and yeah the
fact that they've now figured out how to
throw in a io liquid cooler and there's
pretty freakin cool
pardon the obvious obvious terrible
obvious pun all right go ahead and do
this feel like I should be like checking
if they oh yeah I could have had the
chat up the whole time that's why I put
my laptop there and then I totally
forgot I got distracted I got distracted
building computers can you really blame
me okay the web show starts in yes 35
minutes I am aware of that thank you now
this is a little tricky we've got a
modular power supply and you can see or
maybe you can see but there's not a lot
of clearance are you only overhead you
can see there's not a lot of clearance
for our power button so plugging this in
looks like it might be a bit of a
problem and there's a chance that our
power button will no longer work when
we're done
there's only one way for us to find out
though
by measuring weight there's another way
the MSI Titan what now Titan X Trident X
oh why is it better well I don't know
you can build it yourself for one thing
but no I wouldn't say it's especially
better it is smaller it's quite a bit
smaller like the the thing about small
form-factor
off-the-shelf computers is that they're
like how do I put this they're like you
know validated you know MSI particularly
with that one
didn't even try to go that small they
tried to go really really high
performance and like pretty small ish
whereas this is full small like I am
expecting both our Titan our TX and our
8700 K to throttle at least a little bit
I mean especially this poor Titan dual
eight pin power connectors in a case
that's like smaller that's actually not
much bigger than some external GPU
enclosures except that it also contains
a CPU Ram motherboard etc
don't get an ice-water yeah it'll be no
problem Titan r-tx cooled by ice water
trying to fix it oh man I have not had
good luck with my trying to fix videos
lately so there was that one that we
weren't even sure if it was an upload
where I tried to like glue the CPU back
together because it was like
mechanically separated and people were
mad they were like this is stupid
he didn't even succeed I'm like yeah
okay fair enough
and then I have the one that we filmed
earlier this week David where what was
the problem with that see if you get
right so I thought the issue was that we
got some some liquid metal that like
seeped out seeped off the dye and
shorted something but then we opened it
up and that wasn't the problem but then
we tried like cleaning it up anyway and
and putting it back together and then
that didn't work so that was like I
don't know two hours of shooting time
wasted I think we're actually gonna
upload that video anyway but not to
YouTube because people got so so just
what is it tilt it thank you I was
thinking twisted but I knew that wasn't
right people got very tilted no I was
gonna go with tilting because I think
triggered is like old now right
I don't think triggered is cool anymore
no I don't like if I like whoof that's
not that I don't like roblox I just
don't know what roblox is yeah no I I
prefer with subscribe to PewDiePie so I
bought harder guys bought harder you
know so you're not botting hard enough I
forget what I was even talking about yes
this is why I script all my stuff now
right oh yeah right that video so I
think we're gonna just cut it together
like barely edited at all and then just
like chuck it up on floatplane and if
people like it they like it and if they
don't well then they don't have to watch
it
oh man that's dense like like listen to
that
boom it's heavy I love this thing
alright we're gonna go ahead and pop
this puppy on here I did put the side
paddle on the first thing if it posts I
am yeah this is this is bad bad jeebies
bad jubie's
I don't know it's bad something these Oh
gorgeous man I love this case and that
didn't even take that long to build how
long have we even been streaming doesn't
say well whatever not bad let's fire it
up just put some stuff away here I'm
gonna set a good example for all our
viewers back home okay when you're
working on your build
please make sure that you put everything
away and keep everything together as you
go because otherwise you are going to
regret it
get my LIVESTRONG bracelet on you betcha
you can't tell I'm wearing it on my
ankle so it's on my ankle Jake actually
you know what there's a there's a
different foot here I don't even know
what this foots for I guess this is if
you don't have a graphics card that's
like hardcore mode wow that is a long
power cable thank you
pretty much nice do we have like
keyboard and mouse and all that kind of
good stuff you're working on it I swear
he's like really good at some things
okay do you think it's gonna post first
time
wait what's this bracket for well no one
knows and now we'll put it in there
someone in chat probably knows because
they probably subscribed to floatplane
or subscribe to Kyle on floatplane and
they probably saw his building this
thing already
I saw him upload a video so I was just
like oh yeah that thing but his video is
gonna be way better than this one
because my understanding is he didn't
just like do it live with no manual so
yeah you guys are gonna want to go check
that out if you're actually looking to
build a system in this thing because
it's more of like a step-by-step guide
for those of you who don't know who I'm
talking about Kyle or bit wit he changes
his brand a lot so you know it's
understandable if you don't know who he
is no he didn't change it to something
not stupid it's bit with I think that's
pretty stupid it's better than it's
better than awesomesauce
news or whatever it was before so he's
got that going for him and yes in
fairness to him it's better than Linus
media group because like your name is
Linus and you're completely devoid of
any creative thoughts I just couldn't
figure out what to call the company like
I wanted to describe what we do
so like media and like I want it to be
like I want to be like who it is who's
doing it oh can I actually have an
Ethernet cable Jake that would be swell
be supercool I'm gonna get my cell phone
no no I didn't unplug the stream card
it's all good okay I'm gonna sit in the
trendy chair today no I didn't get one
but yeah that's long enough cool really
really Jake just throw it on the ground
and also no it's not long enough bring
me a different one do it again
actually it's long enough it's fine it's
long enough no no don't
killing me here all right here we go and
I got it no I'm not gonna drop it I
don't actually drop that much stuff for
you guys okay oh this is not comfortable
why is furniture like this cool stupid
oh yeah it's awful what it's deer saying
it's not stupid it's not cool well why
does it exist then that's the only
reason most stupid stuff exists cuz it's
cool Melissa this is awful okay here we
go oh it's supposed to have a cushion
okay here we go
yeah me too I don't see this monitor lit
up though did I forget to plug it in did
oh wait what wait did you yeah what no
do you much do you mind grabbing another
power key thanks Jake thank you oh wait
there's one over there there's one
behind the island he's good I'll
probably have it before he doesn't
okay cool
uh yeah yeah cool thanks there you go
no I found what sorry I didn't mean to
throw it so fast all right
input DisplayPort Wow sometimes
DisplayPort can be kind of stupid so
we'll go ahead and oh that turned off
right away that was not good maybe it
was just like new CPU installed though
like maybe was sitting at the post
screen let's hope let's hope that it's
gonna work because otherwise we yeah
we're free we're just gonna have to end
the stream here well you guys that was
it that was how to build a
non-functional computer in this case
there we go nice beautiful beauty okay
did our MDOT to AH show up yes it did
we've got our 16 gigs around showing up
our 8700 K showing up everything seems
to be working
blink that's fantastic boot override
boom here we go see I sort of know what
I'm doing that I pretend that it works I
mean I can't fake this can i that
probably could there could be a computer
in here and there actually is sort of
some components of a computer in there I
don't know if you can see that but
that's the remnants of the cleanest desk
PC setup so it's just a power supply and
in a kitty Oh Thunderbolt GPU enclosure
why is that still in here oh wow the I
guess we could get this up and running
again pretty quickly that's pretty cool
I am very curious to see how well this
poor Titan r-tx survives in here that is
a rough rough situation here I'm just
gonna scooch over a little bit more
David so you can get a better angle then
you can get a look at how tightly that
graphics card is packed in
check that out oh sorry was that oh yeah
well the laptop is here so that I can
read chats which I just kept I kept
forgetting to do can you put a tridon X
next to it shoot I think the Trident NEX
is back in the inventory is it right
there
oh thanks Alex do you mind bringing it
over cool yeah so we can show you guys
the tribe necks next it's trust me it's
a lot smaller probably the new one
I would think how about my name is Linus
and this is my company yeah that
wouldn't have been better I don't think
cool
apparently the cooling thing I described
is called an HTP pad about 20 bucks or
so to make a laptop cooler out of it
because I had the same idea says Jeremy
how interesting HTP pad huh alright did
this just reboot in like a bad way or a
good way okay so here you go guys thank
you Alex so that is not the same size as
that at all like they're in a similar
class where they're both you know
compact desktops but you can like you
can really see then the terms of the
fitness like if you're trying to you
know slide your gaming computer and or
maybe it's not a gaming machine maybe
you do like a more modest building it if
you're trying to like slide it into your
desk or something this is not doing that
but this is it's really really compact
and then in terms of the the depth as
well
I now have them set back the same amount
so if you switch angles here David and
go this way yeah if you go from where I
am you can really see how much further
out the tried next comes compared to the
century 2.0 your top down right now oh
okay all right well cool Jake is
apparently top down right now and he's
giving you guys a better shot all right
so why don't we just start with some
good old-fashioned prime95 get that hhw
monitor
boom excuse me do you even use sigh soft
Sandra alright task manager excuse me
can I speak to a manager please the task
manager
alright so our package is sitting right
in the neighborhood of 90 to 95 degrees
it's pretty toasty oof oof we just
dropped down to 3.5 gigahertz
I wonder if actually I'd I haven't had
trouble loading things up with prime95 I
just wonder if this motherboard is
configured to not hold turbo for as long
because here if I said I bet if I stop
it give it the old stop Arena here and
then I'm gonna fire it up again options
torture test small FFT blah blah we're
gonna jump right to almost 4 gigahertz
again and we're up in that 90 to 95
degrees Celsius range and I bet it's
gonna it's gonna drop down a little bit
so this this workload might not be
cooperating with us but that's fine
because we probably also have something
else that we could throw at it huh you
know what we could do is we could even
just like try to play 8k footage I've
got red cine X on here that would give
us a pretty good idea so it's turbo
boosting really nicely right now let's
go on our remote drive Z Linus we have a
video coming that I'm really excited
about where we're testing out in videos
CUDA acceleration of real time 8k
playback and I'm not gonna use it right
now because I want to hit the CPU but
it's it does take some faffing about in
order to get it working so it's like
kind of a pain in the butt but it's
really really cool and we show a bunch
of the different ways that you can that
you can accelerate playback of this
whether it's with CPU or GPU and yeah
it's it's pretty impressive anyway
so let's go ahead and play that and that
should hit us pretty hard oh we might be
Network bottlenecked though oh no we're
not actually yeah interesting oh yeah
there we go
now we're up near 90 percent cpu and
we're still turbo wing to 4.3 gigahertz
so that's not bad but we're up near that
90 degree mark either way it's clear
because you'll never see 85 90 % CPU
usage while you're gaming it's clear
that our CPU is going to be fine when
we're gaming and we're gonna be seeing
pretty darn near full turbo on this
thing so that's pretty nice and this is
a very real-world workload not quite the
heaviest one that we could throw at it
but it's pretty abusive this is 30 FPS
4k 7 to 1 compression
excuse me 4k 8 k 7 to 1 compression
ratio red footage and it's just me
goofing around just because we needed a
test clip normally we shoot it more like
20 to 1 so yeah we recorded this
apparently because we're goofballs hey
there we go
we are getting up near 100% usage now
and we're getting near 100 degrees but
we are still turbo into 4.3 gigahertz is
nice alright cool when we go ahead and
fire up a game I actually Jake I don't
know if I actually I might have lied I
don't have any games installed on here
because I think they're on my other
drive csgo yeah but oh you know what
we've got a nice fast CPU so the cache
might actually pull it down pretty
quickly I don't show this again why
would I why would I want to see this
again
alright let's see what our csgo download
speed is here move that's not that great
oh yeah I forgot my thing is woof no I
want I'm
Oh Cinebench r20 sure yeah that's got it
oh no isn't it like a stupid Windows
Store app or something well fortunately
we are what's it what's it even called
Microsoft Store roblox
what's worse roblox is that in here you
see that you see me search for Cinebench
did you see that and it came up with
nothing and then I like click the thing
oh so stupid no thanks
why would I want to sign in to get this
installed especially if I don't have to
ok what wait hold on is it just telling
me that I have to sign in but I actually
don't is this still going don't close
this I discard my changes oh wait no I
think what's Wow
what's sucking back all the cpu is this
download which is coming down at 60
megabytes a second so yeah we're more
CPU limited this must just be one that's
not particularly multi-threaded the good
news is that we're gonna be done in
about 47 seconds here so that's nice
this product is installed ok let's just
see see if that is so misleading I don't
have to do this here it is
it's so stupid alright we're not gonna
be able to run this until csgo is done
but it should be done in about 30
seconds here so see if anybody sent a
super chat but I need to reply to Oh
this was one of them Matt says I'd love
to see a hackintosh build sometime
so would I we actually tried to collab
with the same person that we did on our
last hackintosh build a little while ago
and we sent this individual an 18 core
CPU if I recall correctly along with a
it was a 70 900 X Oh 10 core ok so we
sent him a 70 900 X and a LGA 2066
motherboard and he flaked just stopped
replying to emails and the thing with
hackintosh is that yeah with enough time
we could probably figure it out but
collaborating with someone
into the scene is a way more efficient
way to to work on stuff like that so
that's what we had tried to do and we
basically got screwed so I'm not saying
we're not going to do it I'm just saying
that we tried and it didn't work and so
it'll be later that's that's the way
that's gonna be all right this is just
installing right now just about done
three more seconds and it's in a bench
time so Cinebench are twenty is based on
a much much newer version of the
software compared to our 15 to be
specific five five versions newer and it
gives you some idea of how well the
system should perform in cinema 4d now
there's actually also an unofficial r15
extreme that's like a community created
one that's designed to kind of separate
the men from the boys so to speak when
it comes to like these huge many
threaded CPUs these days but that's also
based on version 15 so this seems like
it would be a better bet it does seem
like it's it's definitely intensive like
we are throttling all the way down to
three point eight five gigahertz now
we're at we were at a hundred degrees
yeah it's hitting it hard
actually but it does seem like it's
still gonna be a really short benchmark
because there's only a six core
processor and it's still doing pretty
well here
yeah I can hear it a little it's not bad
though
here you guys my mic song here so the
CPU fan is definitely ramping up but my
power supply fan still isn't even on
we're using the 600 watt Corsair I think
it's an 80 plus platinum unit and it's
so efficient that even with the CPU load
the fans not even spinning it's pretty
cool once we hit it with a GPU load
though it'll definitely start spinning
we can fire up it's yes go in a minute
here not that csgo is a particularly
representative benchmark for the Titan
r-tx but I thought there were games on
this drive in there are it
and we're live so it's gonna be what it
is you know you got a half button you
gotta roll with that roll with the
punches there you know there you go we
got 30 100 points which most people
won't have a ton of context for because
this benchmark has only been out for a
couple of days neat what I really want
to see though is the GPU temperatures
when we're in games and the CPU
temperature is when we're in games no I
don't want to open the download page
this is fine so here's our GP
temperatures were sitting at 35 idle
that's perfectly reasonable but we'd
expect that cuz look at all this
ventilation you've got like the GPU
until you start to generate a ton of
heat and it starts to kind of recycle
that it's basically running an open air
right now cuz it's all mesh on the top
all mesh along the side where those fans
are drawing in fresh air it's game
launcher oh I have no idea what the
availability in this case is I only
briefly skimmed the email because I was
like oh cool it's those guys again
that's neat guys let me know actually in
the comments on this video if you want
it's cuz we don't really do case reviews
anymore but if you guys want to see a
return to case coverage this might
actually be a way to do it just like do
a built right layout some hardware get
all get all the tools like do it I mean
we can draw a pretty reasonable
conclusion about the kind of build that
you can do and it obviously it's not
gonna be to the same depth as the
hardware contacts or gamers Nexus or
whatever else but it's it's a way for us
to have some fun with it make it really
like hands-on really practical I'm gonna
practice with but you know what no I'm
gonna official match make play here okay
what what what should I do
that's - no no not competitive casual
casual I am I am the filthiest casual
that ever casual - Jake you know this
I'm lucky if I can maintain like one to
one kill the death ratio on in a casual
match and I don't even have a mousepad
right now in fair
this to me oh boy he's eliminating
excuses man I should have used the
excuse after I lost that's the problem
with blowing your excuse load early well
see now I can't even I can't even buy
things because you just are throwing
stuff at me killing me here
oh yeah it's warm up never mind well
look I don't
I only play I only practice with BOTS
David so I don't know these things
alright here we go
Bryan's probably coming to get his
laptop back he's precious alright want
to see my GPU Tim's about 50 degrees oh
did I wait okay Matt shouldn't start yet
oh there's no there's no team damage in
casual alright yeah dual beretta is like
a pro yeah you know it baby I'm sorry I
get a burrito if I get a kill with these
okay
yeah no David would get a kill with them
I'm terrorists right oh crap
well cuz I forgot and that way I'll fire
at the right people okay come on did I
even hit him I hate these games with
recoil honestly I can't play games with
recoil no I know I hit him on the first
shot because I had the crosshairs right
on his head but I didn't go to oh boy so
you've played quake 3 arena with me I go
toe to toe with you and games where you
had the gun actually goes where you
point no problem you're better than you
you were wrecking me David you were
there
what was he wrecking me no he certainly
wasn't that is such BS yeah Alex you
were there was Jake wrecking me in quake
3 arena
I thought David was good too yeah
ads it's good at everything I hate
playing video games with it unless he's
on my team in which case it's lots of
fun hey my team won I helped I did like
eight damage to that guy all right I'm
trying one more time because I want the
free burrito oh I have the bomb what do
you mean I don't get them yeah I get two
chances who cares
no I'm getting the note you have to do
the burrito it's up to the chat what do
you mean I lost know if I get a kill
that's a kill with the dual Berettas no
way no way no way that doesn't count
oh come on they even hit him nope didn't
even hit him how did I miss from there
well I think we're done here hold on
actually before we do that though so
we're sitting up at around 69 degrees
but we also I don't think are even like
fully utilizing our our power budget
here on this card because this is a
pretty it was a pretty bangin card here
yeah we're at like 80% power actually
it's still not bad there's really quiet
huh all right yes I wish to stop playing
now I think we're done here also I think
we're done with the stream thanks for
tuning in guys hope you enjoyed this
live build let us know in the comments
if you want to see more of this type of
concept where we just grab a case grab
some hardware throw it together for your
viewing pleasure and don't forget to
check out our sponsor for today's video
private Internet access we've got it
linked below it's LM GGG / p IA linus to
get that right private Internet access
is the thing to use if you want a VPN
basically what no come on hide your
troop IP address whatever it does things
VPN things do it we've done lots of
videos about what VPNs are good for and
it's a good one so go check it out so
thanks for watching guys dislike if you
just
like like if you liked otherwise
subscribe like check out our forum check
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at link in the video description we
probably won't have one because I have
no idea where to buy it or if it's even
available yet
but how that power supply fan never
turned on sick no no I don't think it's
broken I mean it could be broken yeah no
I didn't kill a guy so I guess</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
