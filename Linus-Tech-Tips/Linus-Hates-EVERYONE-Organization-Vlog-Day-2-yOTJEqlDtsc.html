goal for today we are narrowing the
scope of the project a little bit again
because clearly otherwise we were not
going to get done we're not gonna try to
reconcile all the inventory as we move
it we're just going to get everything
moved and organized so that Tyler can
reconcile it after the fact
oh so that's that's the new plan there
but the plan is still to wipe down every
single box yes
so which takes time yeah clean
everything so all the things basically
everyone's gonna get a rag today wipe
everything down and put them in their
correct categories at some point
probably in the latter half of the day
we need to start tackling 101 Branden
make weapon review thanks everyone wait
let's go
Tunnel bear fur teams makes it easy to
secure your Wi-Fi on any network and
comes with priority support and easy
team management try it for free at the
link below
everyone's doing their part we have a
whole pack of doorstops and I can't find
a single one I don't know what I'm
tearing this is my Lego Mindstorm thing
that I've been interested in forever
oh oh that did not just happen did not
just happen
what was that a 1072 1071 look it's
someone's coffee yeah look at this
hashtag bowling what look over there I
think I was about to use up the paint
sprayer alright hide your kids hide your
wife cuz i spraying everybody out here
and dry it out and put paint inside what
are you doing on inventory and the
organization day taking bubble baby I
can baby bird you guys want to see the
stupidest thing ever check this up what
does feed okay mean okay yeah you have
to do it every time if you turn off now
it cuts off the print so you got a press
ok again it prints out the rest of it
and here's another stroke a mother
ingenious instead of making the warning
track that you're almost out of tape
readable they cover the whole damn thing
oh gee thank you
I guess I'm almost out of tape but I
would have had enough for this label if
you poles hadn't covered it in black
stripes well you know what I'm sticking
it to the man you can't make me buy a
new label you're just sticking it to
your employees by making us read that
one of those before
hey you that's right what are you doing
today John this area here I have helped
EJ
get this sorted if you have so many bins
one can say that we are bin Laden hey
don't put that on the video it's
definitely going in that's putting
things in the wrong spot but somebody
told me to put them there so long as
Linus doesn't find out everything okay
how can you have too many SATA cables
you don't think this is too many no it's
not you don't think this is too many no
because you're a hoarder we should do
them by color and then buy the connector
director like who's who's using the
camera not the rich people get this
perception that I'm like some kind of
like Nazi mean boss but like this is
what I'm doing so gross I don't think
it's Terrance they're small helots it is
your socks James are these your socks
socks Edie soft not me me okay then I'm
gonna take this bin I'm gonna make it
Boston panel we need your investigation

switch to ting they'll cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to 75 bucks and
they've got new lowered mobile data
