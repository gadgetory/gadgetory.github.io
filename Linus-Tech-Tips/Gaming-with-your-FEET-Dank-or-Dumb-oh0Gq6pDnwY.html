merits of a keyboard mouse versus a
controller for gaming today because the
PC setup is obviously superior for the
majority of genres whether you need
accurate pointing in an FPS or a ton of
key real estate in a MOBA but that
doesn't mean that the keyboard and mouse
is a natural interface there are a ton
of movements here that take time and
muscle memory to develop if you want to
get good at them or at least there were
what if I told you that you could
offload some of those trickier moves to
a third appendage allowing you to do
more things with little effort I'm
talking of course about the beacon get
your mind out of the gutter man it's a
Bluetooth controller design for your
foot I said get your mind out of the
gutter come on but is this just what you
need to gain an edge and kick ass or is
it a waste of your hard-earned money
well it's a Kickstarter so it could very
well be both let's check it out after I
tell you about today's sponsor Mac
Weldon Mac Weldon makes great underwear
t-shirts socks wallets and more they
believe in simple shopping and if you
use code tech tips you'll get 20% off at
the link below
they're kind of big cut
now our early test unit still has some
rough edges from their small-scale 3d
printer but it's got it where it counts
the plastic construction is very solid
despite being lightweight the strap
appears to be durable enough and it's
long enough to wrap around even your
steel toed boots with foam cushioning on
the bottom to contribute to a
comfortable feel even after multiple
hours of use which it's USB rechargeable
battery affords so so far so good
the unit is detachable thanks to a
satisfyingly strong magnet though other
than charging there's not really much
reason to pick it up because aside from
the on/off switch everything is
communicated by differently colored LEDs
and vibrating haptic feedback so then
once you strap it on to your foot what
exactly can you do with this thing well
theoretically lots you can use it for
nearly anything that your keyboard can
do using the included software to map
key presses to one of four actions roll
left roll right pitch up and pitch down
sorry aviation nerds
there is no yah now the device
calibrates itself every time it's
activated and all of the movements are
relative to your starting position so
you can even use it with your legs
crossed like if you wanted to stretch a
glute while you game but it's more than
just four extra keys each gesture can
accommodate up to six keystrokes map
sequentially across the gestures range
of movement so the idea is that the
farther you tilt the device the more
commands you can execute in this way you
can create pseudo macros but without
actually using any automation like if
you have to press down forward punch to
throw a Hadouken then you can map that
sequence so all you have to do is rock
your foot to throw
fireballs all day long as for the
shooter and MOBA fans out there the
beacon can be useful for you too in FPS
I found the most useful commands to
offload are the ones that would
otherwise make you have to hold a key
down like crouching sprinting or
push-to-talk
with the beacon you can do these things
without inhibiting the movement of your
fingers in any way and you can even do
otherwise impossible things like
strafing right and reloading at the same
time and with MOBAs a mouse or RTS games
it's really nice to be able to easily
deploy spells or seldom-used abilities
without fumbling to reach for keys that
you aren't fairly familiar with notice
that I said nice to be able to now there
are lots actually lots of gamers out
there with physical disabilities for
whom this could be a total lifesaver
since you can use it instead of a hand
or PEC even wear it on your head but
others might only get marginal utility
from it which means that the price needs
to be right so it's gonna be retailing
for a hundred and thirty-eight euros or
about a hundred and sixty US dollars
it's a little bit out sheet and that's
with them trying to keep the price down
doesn't even come with a micro USB cable
in the box
compare that with other stomp based foot
controllers that while may be bulkier
and less versatile come in at under $100
although it should be noted that the
stinky foot board which I'm referring to
specifically did go out of business
despite being widely adored so maybe
that one should have cost more or less I
don't know and unlike some pedals you
can't expect the beacon to be able to
simulate a gas pedal with varying
amounts of force the input is either on
or off just like a regular keyboard so
should you invest in a beacon wearable
controller well while it is pretty darn
decent at doing what it says it's going
to do offering you a tweak task
amount of control over how the keys are
pressed the reality is that most of us
won't need something like this that
badly so the main people we'd recommend
it for are those with physical
impairments or gamers finding themselves
in desperate need of a few more buttons
but who aren't concerned about complying
with tournament play rules which
generally don't allow macros which this
could kind of be considered to be
otherwise this kick starter might be a
supposed to be shaking my my foot a
non-starter fresh bollocks is the small
business accounting software
custom-built for how you want to work
it's a simple way to be more productive
more organized and to get paid faster
