YouTube about the RAM testing video I
uploaded yesterday see I've got four
sticks going here now tempted and I
didn't I thought I'd do an update video
just to address a lot of the questions
and concerns and comments that you guys
had so as you can see I did finish my 24
hour test with the three modules I had
before which were running in
triple-channel just want to clarify this
some one looks a little bit confused
about how you can run triple channel in
a quad channel motherboard so to clarify
guys any dual channel motherboard is
capable of running single channel any
triple channel motherboard is capable of
running dual channel or a single channel
and any quad channel motherboard is
capable of running single dual or triple
or quad so the way that you do that is
you populate the DIMM slots in the
correct order so here you can see we've
got a 1 and B 1 right there so if you
wanted to run into a channel you'd go a
1 B 1 then if you wanted to run in
triple channel you'd populate C 1 and if
you wanted to turn in quad channel you'd
populate D 1 so there you go
that's how you do it right now it's
running in quad channel because I do
have 4 memory sticks in here I also had
a lot of people commenting on the fact
that I wasn't using them test 86 mem
test 86 is awesome great memory
diagnostic utility it runs before the
operating system which is really really
good at tests all of the memory and it
throws a big read errors if it detects
anything the problem is that the issue I
was having was not being detected by mem
test 86 so the reason I was stubbornly
using prime 95 is because I don't I'm a
little bit old-school and I'm not using
Linux are Linpack or any of the other
sort of Intel burn test these are all
tools that I haven't really used that
much plus I knew that I could
consistently reproduce the errors on
these sticks with a prime95 test after a
certain amount of time this is just a
test bench this is not my main machine
so I'm not that concerned with it not
being running at any given moment so the
fact that mem test 86 wasn't working for
me is what prompted me to use prime95 if
meant
works to detect the error that you're
getting then that's great however there
are even times prime95 detects nothing
mem test 86 comes up with errors in like
five seconds so you can never really
predict which tool is going to be the
one that is going to find the problem
with what you're doing although people
in the comments are right generally
speaking men test 86 is the first one to
go for they have all kinds of awesome
ways to run it so you can just burn the
ISO to a CD which is what I usually do
because I'm lazy or they actually have a
I just didn't want to empty a USB Drive
they have a USB drive creator so you
just throw a blank USB drive in and it
will go ahead and fix all that up for
you so right what other people ask that
was really really really good yes this
is a really good one so people a lot of
people asked how did you rule out the
motherboard the CPU the power supply all
that stuff so this is a very important
part of any sort of troubleshooting
scenarios you got to make sure am I
actually isolating the right components
oh I knew it was the Wrentham because
I'd had this motherboard with this CPU
with this power supply running with this
Kingston HyperX memory at these speeds
so 1600 c920 command rate all of that
good stuff so that's how I rolled up the
motherboard that's how I've ruled out
the CPU and power supply you got a rule
out things like heat I'm running on an
open test platform with air flow
directly over the fan or the RAM itself
so we can pretty much rule out heat how
do you ever let your RAM settings well
because this memory was running at these
settings in the past so that's how I
know that it should be fine assuming
nothing's gone wrong with it in the
meantime so these are my two dead ones
this one errors in prime95 this one
errors in a multi-channel configuration
eventually haha that's another one it
had a lot of people commenting - you
idiot why didn't you just run one stick
at a time guys if you'd watch the video
you'd know I had already run all of the
sticks individually this stick the one
right there on the left passes on its
own but as soon as you put it in a
multi-channel configure
it the entire thing fails whereas all of
these sticks all together in a
multi-channel config are not failing so
that's how I know that this guy right
here with the duct tape is dead that one
on the left is borderline which is not
good enough it's for all intents and
purposes dead but it's much harder to
catch compared to one that's just
outright dead doesn't coast or it causes
blue screens right away so I think that
pretty much covers it thank you for
checking out this sort of updated video
on diagnosing memory I hope this Claire
clears up some of the questions you guys
had don't forget to subscribe Cline is
tech tip from unboxings reviews and
other computer videos I love this camera
using the fs700 today I was using the XA
10 last time the Mike's terrible though
I don't have my lapel mic I'm using the
shotgun mic that's on the top so before
you complain about the audio just I know
it's wrong Mike I'm sorry one more thing
in spite of my warnings to the contrary
I did have a couple people saying oh my
room is stable enough it works in games
and just cuz it fails in prime95 after
an hour doesn't mean it's not so yes it
does it means it's not stable it isn't
stable it's not good enough if it ever
crashes when your computer's doing
something critical it can completely
corrupt your entire OS and make it non
bootable the odds of that happening I
don't know you roll that die last thing
is it has to be stable in every in every
stress test it has to be stable and
prime stable and mem test stable and
Linux a stable system is stable and
doesn't make mistakes when I'm done this
prime95 test just for good measure
because remember that fourth stick has
been in my wife's machine so I for all I
know it's dead too so I'm gonna run the
whole thing through mem test 86 again
once I'm done here in order to reassure
myself that all of this is working
completely a hundred percent before I
redeploy it in a system and another
thing I forgot it had a lot of people
saying - you have so much memory why
don't you just throw it away and buy a
new memory memory so cheap what are you
crazy throw away Hardware cheese way to
be moneybags no you don't throw away
hardware
you test it you see if it works if it
works you keep it if it doesn't work and
you throw it away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
