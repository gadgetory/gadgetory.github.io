phantom was an okay plastic case its
successor the phantom 530 is still NATO
plastic and still has that kind of retro
Alienware esque look but it is so much
more than okay with its factory tuning
and data center DNA and Intel 730 series
SSD is an amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts which doesn't
make it immune to criticism I'm aware of
the cost benefits of using hard packing
foam but this is how my case arrived
hard foam is good for one solid impact
then will be destroyed by a subsequent
one fortunately this one only got hit
once so the case arrives in perfect
condition at least that hard foam is
nice and thick the manual is pretty good
and has an extremely detailed list of
all the parts included with the case and
their purposes this is something a lot
of manufacturers miss and it helps up
novice builders a lot and I also noticed
when going through the included items
that it comes with a ton of zip ties
with most manufacturers it feels like
they include them just to make sure they
can tick off the marketing bullet point
NZXT seems to actually intend for you to
cable manage your system with them kudos
their external features of this case are
pretty straightforward
aesthetically they've updated the lines
and curves in a way that I find more
pleasing and they've added a shaped side
panel window that I appreciate as well
functionality wise they've added an
eighth PCI slot and implemented their
signature rear LED illumination to make
plugging things into the back much
easier on the top we find a 30 watt fan
controller front audio and front USB 3
ports then tucked away behind the solid
feeling front door we've got three five
and a quarter inch bays but use a pretty
clever release lever system and a reset
switch that's both easy to get to and
impossible to hit by accident moving
inside sorta let's talk liquid cooling
options the phantom 530 has strong water
cooling support triple 120 or dual 140
in the top dual 120 in the front dual
120 in the bottom so of course I used an
IO liquid cooler for my test build first
impressions of the rad
counting in the top we're strong the
very open mesh up here is great for
airflow and an opportunity for accent
lighting with LED fans or you can just
put black in there to not draw attention
to them then things got a little bit
rougher the fans or the radiator need to
go in the hump up here at the top of the
case to avoid clearance issues with the
motherboard but the top bezel to access
the top fans is very difficult to remove
after some persistence and force I got
my first look at the extremely flexible
fan mounting points on the top though
and it kind of made it worthwhile I
actually don't remember who started this
trend but using slits instead of holes
is a great inclusion for water cooling
aficionados and this system saved my
bacon here because I hate moving optical
drives below the top mounting position
so I needed my red in the very very back
position at the back of the case
managing the radiator fan connectors
down to the integrated fan controller is
a treat NZXT strategically avoids
openings in the top of the motherboard
tray where they're not needed so it's
very clean-looking in theory
unfortunately the built in fan
controller which supports 10 fans or 30
watts max whichever comes first is DC
only and not DC only like 4 pin pwm fans
will be DC controlled like the plugs are
too close together to use for pin fans
and they physically won't fit unless you
get adapters also the included extension
cables would need to be chopped up to
work with a four pin fan but don't
interpret that as me hating the
integrated fan controller I wish it was
a little bit more flexible but its
weaknesses affected my build very little
and when it is usable it is a fantastic
value add that comes with the case and
it gets better I love how it and all the
other front panel stuff are pre wired
into the case and pre cable managed but
there's even an extra bonus I've been
saying for a long time that we should be
using twist ties instead of zip ties for
cable management it's just a little bit
less plastic to throw away every time
because they're reusable and that's
exactly what NZXT is using which is
great because unlike a zip tie method
where I'd have to cut them all and then
throw them away
completely REE cable manage it anyway
when I built my system this way
I can open them up add a few more cables
as needed close them back up reroute
things and all of that without having to
even break into the zip ties that come
with the case awesome
speaking of cable management it's the
strongest point of this case in my
opinion the rubber grommets internally
are improved over older designs they're
harder to accidentally knock out when
running cables through them due to due
to the deeper channels around the edges
I'm just going to keep going there's
ample cable management for the 24 pin
and more behind the mobo tray which is
quite strong actually in spite of its
oversized CPU cut out for easy cooler
installation and then also back here we
find that ton of cable loops for pinning
everything down at nice and flat and we
also find what is still my favorite
system for a tray melted SSD Corsair
spring loaders are a lot faster to use
but they just don't feel as robust
especially with slimmer drives not that
it really matters SSDs aren't fragile
just a personal preference thing on to
the rest of the inside the tall case
feet combined with the little support
pillars that keep your power supply
raised up a little bit are in my opinion
a great feature it means that the PSU
isn't necessarily drawing in all fresh
cool air through the filtered bottom
intake but it also can't suffocate from
being installed on a thick carpet and as
someone who accidentally killed a power
supply that way once it's a trade-off
that I'll take drive mounting is great
the five and a quarter inch bays use a
totally over built steel design and I
love the three to one hard drive cage
configuration you can stack up from the
bottom stack down from the top or fill
the whole thing to put in up to six
drives wherever you want or you can
remove the bottom mounting entirely and
put rads on the front of the bottom very
nice now I don't understand though why
the three and a half inch two and a half
inch cages slide in from the right side
that means I have to take off both side
panels
whenever I'm upgrading a drive now
arguably most people will take off both
anyway since it makes cable management a
lot easier but if I'm in a hurry I can
just run it through
bother and if I'm a good builder when I
build my system in the first place I
could leave those cables in the right
place for myself so if I could slide the
cajon from this side I would only have
to take off one panel honestly though
that's one of the only ease-of-use
complaints I have about the case the
pre-installed motherboard standoffs
thumbscrew heavy design and safe rounded
internal corners make the case a really
really easy one to build in and it looks
great to the finish and color matching
between the plastic and painted steel
has improved a lot since the first
phantom I looked at and if I had to
complain about the looks I guess I the
fan mount on the side panel hurts the
overall aesthetic a little bit for me
and I don't really feel like it's going
to cool these drives much better anyway
likely it's only useful if you've
installed that weird hinged fan thing
that's kind of like a spot cool to point
at your graphics card another thing I
don't really feel like ruining the looks
of my system over but that's about all I
can find to gripe about so I guess all
that's left is to give this case a
hearty recommendation the Phantom 530 is
our great case it's a bit older now so
I'm probably not the first reviewer to
come to this conclusion but better late
than never I hope bright guys thanks for
