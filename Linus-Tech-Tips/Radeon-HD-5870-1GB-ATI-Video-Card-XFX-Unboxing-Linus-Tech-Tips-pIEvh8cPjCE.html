have the XFX Radeon 5870 so this is the
new will V DirectX 11 card on the market
right now so that means if you want to
run DirectX 11 titles which are coming
out on Windows 7 you will need a 58 70
and the 58 50 is actually coming shortly
so as I said before this is an XFX card
so even though it's using the reference
cooler like all of the 58 70s at launch
you do get the benefit of XFX is 5 star
support which means you've got a double
lifetime water friendly warranty and I'm
pretty sure there are other benefits too
but this is an unboxing so we'll go with
the unboxing aspect of it okay I love
this I've seen this before with XFX as
cards it's a door hanger do not disturb
I'm gaming awesome it also has a
convenient little thing which has your
part number in your serial number so if
you ever need to call XFX support you've
got all the info you need right there
here's your quick installation guide
showing you how to install the card in
your system then you have a full
installation guide which shows you how
to install the drivers so they're
instructing you to use the XFX included
CD but by the time these cards are
actually out there you're going to want
to download the latest drivers on ATI
comm so here's your driver installation
CD and then we have Oh congratulations
on your purchase of a new H everyday on
graphics card and you get a copy of dirt
2 which is included as far as I know
with all 5870 graphics cards so let's
see let's do the accessory package here
first okay in here we have a crossfire
bridge 2 molex to PCI Express 6 pin
adapters and one DVI to VGA adapter now
that brings us to the card itself which
you can see is incredibly well packed in
here with all this foam that's awesome
to see ok here we go
this is the XFX Radeon HD 5870 now here
let's just start at the back of the card
and move our way to the front so we've
got DisplayPort which is an open
standard a lot like HDMI except with
HDMI which we also have you got to pay a
royalty now like all HD series cards for
the last couple generations you do get
audio out via HDMI so that's really cool
then you've got dual DVI as well as
those other display standards so you can
actually run up to three monitors off of
this card now here you've got your vents
so let's go around we'll have a look at
the sticker design because the sticker
design is going to be the major
difference between all of the launch
cards so you can see the fan here sucks
air in from the back and from the top of
the card and then exhaust it out that
little tiny vent now that is a bit of a
limitation of the design but there's not
much we can do about it this has been
kind of compared to the Batmobile in in
shape here and I think that's definitely
an accurate comparison it's pretty cool
looking from the front up on the top
let's get to the the no-nonsense
features here so we've got two PCI
Express six pin connectors this is a
very power efficient card so there's no
need to go crazy and put on a bunch of
eight pin sort of connectors when it's
installed in your case it's going to
look a little bit something like this
you got your ATI Radeon graphics logo
thing here and then on the back we've
seen this before with the launch
versions of the GTX 260 and 280
we've got a full heatsink on the back
cooling the RAM in addition to your
backplate so I really like to see that -
this is a PCI Express 16 X card and I
think that pretty much sums up the
Radeon HD 5870 thank you for checking
out my unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
