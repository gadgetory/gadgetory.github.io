pretty cool product from BenQ now we
recently looked at a 24 inch monitor
from BenQ that had a VA panel and an LED
backlight but this one's a little bit
different it has some additional
features so this is the BL 2400 PU it is
also a 24 inch da panel with LED
backlighting however it also has some
other cool features so let's get this
guy opened up and have a quick boom
inside shall we the first thing we are
going to find is hey look at this BenQ
switching to a more eco-friendly
packaging they're using they're using a
die cut cardboard insert in order to
give you the the best biodegradability
possible you can actually see they're
using like they're using double they're
doubling up on the cardboard and a lot
of the areas to make sure that you've
got really good rigidity to this overall
I mean that's that's standing actually
there's a lot to be learned from
packaging like this actually I mean I
know I I talked about the Box a lot
these days but you unbox enough products
and it starts to just sort of come
natural
so here's the base here we've got our
rubber feet on the bottom so that the
monitors not gonna slip around we've got
a pretty standard little screw in for
attaching the monitor it's kind of like
that okay so that's the first piece we
find inside the box next we're gonna go
ahead and remove oh we're gonna find
disc okay I've never been able to
understand why monitor comes with the
disc so get rid of that and let's take
this out so no accessories okay here I
am I keep wanting to take out the
packaging but I can't do it yet we have
a USB a2b cable so that's gonna be for
the built-in USB hub we have a power
cord we have an audio cord it does have
built-in speakers and then we also have
an included VGA cable okay
for those back in there and then now we
can take this out look at that all kinds
of like one elaborate piece yeah
somebody probably has to fold this my
hand I'm telling you that stuff probably
how it works so then we find the monitor
itself and this is where things start to
get a little bit more exciting because
I've already given away the big secret
which is the VA panel and the LED
backlight but what I haven't told you is
that this monitor also has some pretty
unique connectivity options so I'm going
to go ahead and attach the base just for
the sake of showing you how simple it is
so hopefully I can make it look pretty
simple here otherwise we're gonna be in
for a bit of a rough show all right here
we go so we're just gonna go ahead and
take the base position it in there just
like that and then we're gonna tip it up
all right so that's pretty
straightforward and then we're just
gonna screw it in and hopefully this
works you can use a screwdriver but you
can probably get it tight enough by hand
anyway so I wouldn't worry too much
about it and there we go that was the
whole assembly process for this monitor
so I want to show you a few things right
off the bat first of all there is a
built-in USB hub so if you go and look
on the right-hand side of the monitor
here you've got 4 USB ports so that was
what that a 2b cable was for you just
plug from here into the back of your
computer and that's gonna be your hub
right there that looks like it's gonna
be a passive hub not or capacitive a non
powered hub so you're only gonna be
using things like keyboards and mice I
wouldn't expect to be powering a bunch
of two and a half inch you know hard
drives or anything off of it ok next
we've got the options for all of this
stuff so we're gonna press in here and
okay hold on let's see if I can figure
this out oh okay hold on we got to tear
this off first and then we can lift yes
there we go so that's for security and
shipping okay ah yes okay well I put the
base on before taking that off so that
won't work quite as well but you can see
that it actually adjusts up quite high
cameraman if you want
step back and have like a quick look at
the monitor itself so it adjusts all the
way from way down low like this all the
way like that so you can pretty much
adjust it to whatever is ergonomically
comfortable for you this monitor also
has a side-to-side option okay you can
tilt it up and down just like that
actually here you want to grab it from
the side so that I can show you just how
much you are able to tilt it so
depending where you're sitting you can
sit and look up at your monitor like
this or are you kidding sit up here and
look down at it you have all the options
in the world available to you and if you
view a lot of photos or anything like
that you can also go ah there we go
90 degrees to the side and have it in
portrait mode so while you got it in
portrait mode why don't we have a quick
look at the connectivity that I was
talking about so here we've got our
power button right there and then our
speaker bar is running all along the oh
no it isn't my bad the speakers are
actually here on the bottom but here we
go right here there's our power oh
here's all the buttons camera man's
trying to show you that I guess that's
justified so here is enter here is the
brightness adjustment this looks like
something else menu and auto so I'm sure
once you have the on screen display up
you'll be able to figure out what all of
those do fairly easily here's our power
in and then finally we have audio in
headphone and DisplayPort how's that for
cool we have finally a good value
DisplayPort monitor that offers a VA
panel an LED backlight a pretty
slick-looking design and a price point
that isn't ridiculous so that is pretty
darn cool and I'd say that sort of
feature number one I mean the Eyefinity
guys are going to go nuts over a monitor
like this
because you don't have to use any
expensive adapters you can just grab
three of these monitors and boom you got
affinity with three times HD resolution
we've also got your standard DVD and VGA
inputs we've got a Kensington lock on
the back and you can see we've got a
standard four point screw mounting
system so you can actually arm mount
this monitor or hey if you want to run
it in eyefinity you can even get one of
those triple monitor mounts so thank you
for checking out the unboxing and first
look at this Bend KVL 2400 series LED
monitor and don't forget to subscribe to
