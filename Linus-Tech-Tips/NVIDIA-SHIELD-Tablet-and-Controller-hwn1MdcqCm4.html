that when Nvidia first unveiled this
thing my only reaction was oh I guess
I'll have to keep waiting for a proper
Tegra k1 handheld then my feedback about
the concept was actually so negative at
the press event that my contact there
asked me if I even wanted a review
sample I said yeah and don't worry I'll
be fair to it
so while Nvidia is not positioning the
shield tablet as a replacement to the
shield portable I stowed my handheld for
a week and have only used this one since
then so that I can tell you guys about
the experience the Flash Voyager GTX USB
3 drive from Corsair provides SSD like
performance and fits comfortably in your
pocket click now to learn more so here's
the package NVIDIA sent it includes the
tablet itself and some optional
accessories the magnetic hinge tablet
cover that supports auto sleep-wake and
three different viewing positions with
the magnets in the back of the shield
and the wireless controller which will
actually cover in more depth later spec
wise this Chi is very well equipped for
the price it's going to take her k1
processor with 192 Kepler GPU cores 2
gigs of ram a 19-point 75 watt hour
battery that was good for over two and a
half hours of continuous trying to
gaming and 16 gigs of storage in the
Wi-Fi model with 32 gigs in the LTE
enabled model at the front we find an 8
inch 1920 by 1200 IPS screen that I
would describe as pretty darn good
motion blur wasn't a problem when gaming
it's maximum brightness made it suitable
for use in almost any environment and
this really stood out to me this is the
first device I've ever used whose
minimum brightness is very comfortable
to use even in complete dark also on the
front is a 5-megapixel selfie camera
that captures 1080p video can actually
be used to stream to twitch TV natively
on the device as well as to loud stereo
speakers my only complaint about the
front is that the edges of the screen
are a little bit harsh and scraped my
fingers a little bit when I slice wipe
in from the side not a huge deal on the
back we find the other 5 megapixel
camera on the bottom we find the latches
for the magnetic cover
on the top we find the gpu-accelerated
stylus pen whose chiseled soft tip and
low latency stood out to me even though
I'm not really a stylus guy and it
stayed stashed there throughout the
review process we find slots for a sim
and microSD expansion card a volume
rocker and a lock button then on each
side we've got bass ports for the front
speakers with the left side also
featuring a micro USB port a mini HDMI
output that can handle 1080p 60fps and a
three-and-a-half millimeter headset
audio jack that pretty much wraps up the
tablet but I promised to say more about
their Wi-Fi direct console grade
controller which is actually a
significant product launch in its own
right the direct benefits of this
controller over a Bluetooth one are
potentially less interference on 5
gigahertz much higher bandwidth for more
simultaneous controllers support for
audio with the integrated mic which can
also be used for Google now when your
tablet's mic is 10 feet away or with the
built-in headset jack and lower latency
although most of these things aren't
really my problem with existing
Bluetooth controllers my issue has
always been the lame-o build quality
even from products that claim to be
console grade Nvidia solution isn't
perfect the triggers and d-pad feel a
bit mushy for me and the B&amp;amp;Y button
placement has be basically on the edge
of the controller and why actually too
high for me to read comfortably if I
hold the controller along the grooves
the way it's designed but I got to give
them credit it's still the best option
I've seen so far the pairing process
takes just a few seconds with the
included app and other than the triggers
the tactile feedback has been pretty
well received by everyone I've shown it
to the touch pad for Mouse movement in a
pinch is great the joysticks are solid
and if you gain a few hours a day you'll
only need to charge the battery once
every week or two
I'd still use an Xbox controller where
possible but I actually prefer this one
to Sony's Dual Shock alright so now that
we've covered the tableting controller
separately let's discuss how they go
together and how you might use them now
my biggest objection to this device that
the briefing was the need to carry
around two pieces instead of one when
I'm using games dream to be in PC games
2 it around the house or playing Android
games on it when I'm out and about so
let's go through a few of the different
ways that I already use a shield device
and how this stacks up so we'll start
with the toilet in this case shield
portable is the big winner unless you
sit backwards on the toilet there's
really nowhere to put a screen that's
not attached to the controller next up
is the bath where I actually spend a
good 25% of my shield gaming time once
again I prefer portable but only because
I don't have a better tablet stand the
bigger screen is definitely better here
but the integrated covers angles make it
a little bit hard to view the screen
straight on from there next up is in bed
here the tablet shines for a while lying
on my stomach was the best gaming
experience in bed with the tablet
propped up on a pillow in front of me
but I found that my neck got
uncomfortable and strained and when it
was time to shift I couldn't flip over
and hold the device above me the way
that I can with the handheld so I'm
going to call this another win for the
portable especially if you want a game
for extended periods of time in the car
propping up the tablet on your lap
actually works surprisingly well and was
reasonably balanced as long as the
driver doesn't break suddenly another
win for the portable but as much as I'm
kind of piling on here there are some
types of scenarios where the tablet is
world's better than the portable if
there's a flat surface in front of you
let's say an airplane food tray dining
room table desk in the cafeteria at
school for example it is a much more
comfortable experience to gain with a
bigger screen a lighter controller and
your hands in a more relaxed position on
your legs so at the end of the day it's
going to come down to where you plan to
use it and if you're willing to trade
the convenience of an attached
controller that you don't have to carry
separately with the convenience of a
larger screen and a much better typing
experience mean typing on shield
portable or using any apps that have to
run in landscape or portrait mode is
terrible mobile use aside I guess you
could buy this strictly as a tablet and
as a game console for your TV I've
actually only done it a couple times
because I have a media PC but according
to Nvidia
lots of people plug into their TVs using
HDMI and console mode and there's a
compelling argument to be made for this
Android games PC games at up to 1080 60
P with an OTG Ethernet dongle anda and
an enabled PC elsewhere in the house and
Netflix at 1080p makes for a pretty
complete entertainment experience that
you can have the added benefit of being
able to pick up and take with you
wherever you go so its conclusion time
and it's a bit of a long one today
sorry guys outside of gaming it's a
wonderful piece of technology that I'd
be very comfortable recommending to a
wide variety of want to be tablet owners
with the Tegra k1 chip in its core the
performance is awesome the stylus with
the included handwriting recognition
will be a godsend for students or anyone
who wants to take a lot of notes and
they're included physics and able
painting app is going to be a ton of fun
for artists to play around with the
software is nearly stock Android with
only a few tweaks like an Auto
power-down mode so it's more likely to
have some juice when you pick it up if
you only use it once in a while and it
gets a big thumbs up from you there for
gamers I actually feel like it's more
than that in spite of some framerate
dips and the preloaded copy of trying to
let's not pretend it runs as well as it
does on a PC the fact that this product
exists proves that we're heading in a
really amazing direction we've got
OpenGL 4.4 and DirectX 12 feature
support on a tablet we've seen the new
features that shield owners have enjoyed
over the last year like grid powered
remote gaming keypad mapping for Android
games and over the Internet game stream
from your own PC and what all of this
demonstrates is invidious continued
belief in this whole Android gaming
thing something that I actually agree
with very strongly I mean sure this is a
little ahead of its time I mean other
than older emulated console games
there's not much for a local multiplayer
or split-screen android games if you
want to play up the console experience
with up to four attached controllers but
I'm just glad that someone's got the
balls and resources to invest in the
hardware we need to build a platform for
developers to even want to work on these
games and that they've done it without
falling into the same trap of creating a
device that only really does one thing
online
previous attempts to create an Android
gaming device the shield tablet manages
to be a very compelling value as a
tablet for normal people while also
delivering the right features to be a
super cool gaming device not an easy
thing to do
I still don't need a tablet and this
still doesn't change that but I've got
to give NVIDIA credit anyway they nailed
