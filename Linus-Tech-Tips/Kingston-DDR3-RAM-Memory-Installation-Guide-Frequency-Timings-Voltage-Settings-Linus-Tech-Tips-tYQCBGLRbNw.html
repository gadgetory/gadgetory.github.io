to install memory I realize I might have
sort of poked fun at anyone who doesn't
know how to install memory in one of my
recent videos and for that I feel
terribly bad but yeah this is going to
just be a basic guide so step one it's
going to be ground yourself out touching
a plugged in power supply just like that
step two you can see I've already
installed two of this triple channel kit
so two of the modules but I'm going to
go ahead and install the third module
now this is soos board this is the
rampage 3 extreme is a little bit
different from most motherboards because
on the one side these are not proper
clips and on the other side they are
proper clips so what you do is you just
push this side in okay make sure it's in
the right spot push this side in okay
and then you push down the other side of
the module until the clip goes in now if
you had clips on both sides then you'd
actually push it in evenly and then the
clips would go on both sides is fairly
straightforward
now that was it for the physical
installation but this is the part that
some people actually don't know about if
you install new memory in your system
and boot it up most motherboards are
going to default to a safe setting
rather than the actual capabilities of
the RAM modules you installed so this
motherboard is I just put in to our
peretta 2 6 gigs of ddr3 1600 megahertz
okay and so 1600 megahertz is the speed
and it also runs at C 9 timings okay
overclocking failed please enter setup
blah blah blah press f12 run setup
that's what I want to do so you can see
right here it is not running at 1600
megahertz right off the bat we see that
so the first thing we're going to change
is the DRAM frequency and yeah I press
the right button so we're going to set
that to 1600 megahertz select ok to use
the current DRAM voltage something
automatically oh ok select cancel to
increase the DRAM voltage automatically
if your dims require high voltage well
we're gonna do it we're not going to do
it automatically we're going to do it
manually and this is something that you
may not be able to tell by looking at
the modules or even by looking at the
packaging see on these all we can see
here is a part number so with that you
can throw the part number on the
kingston website and then
find out exactly what all the settings
are you need for your rent so there's
the frequency which is 1600 we've
already set that then there's the
latencies and usually for even for an
intermediate to advanced user you're
only going to set for Layton sees and
the most important one for performance
is the CL or cast latency so here we've
got that set and then the last one is
the voltage we're going to do the
voltage next here so this Ram is rated
at one point six five volts just like
most ddr3 kits for core i5 and core i7
because it's not recommended to use a
higher voltage than that for these tips
due to the integrated memory controller
so I'm actually going to go touch lower
most quality Ram is going to run at its
rated speed even with a little bit less
voltage anyway but that's one of the
ways to be able to talk okay here these
are all the different ways to be able to
tell a quality kit from a lower quality
kit frequency higher frequency is good
latency lower latency is good and
voltage lower voltage is good so the
ideal memory kit would run at the
fastest frequency with the lowest
latency and the lowest voltage obviously
like anything in computers it's always a
bit of a trade-off but this is a fairly
mainstream kit and let me just see if
there's anything that we can do to get a
little bit further into this Ram
configuration this is a very very
performance oriented board so I'm sure
I'm going to find something here I might
be under advanced CPU confuse you find
the RAM settings under CPU these days
because it is running off the integrated
controller on the CPU it might just be a
matter of setting oh cool XMP modules
are XMP profiles this is another thing I
wanted to talk about this is a way for
your RAM to have a little setting on it
that tells your motherboard what all of
its default settings are so here you see
1600 megahertz nine nine nine twenty
seven that's the latency one end so
that's like kind of like the old 1 T 2 T
timing one is better and then you've got
one point 6 5 volts to one point 4 volts
there you go look at that so xnp is a
pretty cool thing
EP p is the nvidia equivalent and then
the other one is cpu rog and then
manual so if we go to manual then I'm
guessing it will actually let me set
something other than the DRAM frequency
here's getting that warning again memory
configuration timing control here we go
so here you can see it's already set to
almost the right things but I can
actually set the latency as myself so
you can either go in and set the all the
frequency latency and voltage yourself
or you can 27 was actually what it was
rated for and then let me just see if I
can find the ttttt ah yes 1 and here we
go so now it is set manually to what
it's supposed to be or if you want to
make life easy for yourself you can just
go in and by oops oh I just almost set
my CPU voltage 1.65 bad bad very bad
1.65 there we go or you can just use an
XMPP profile to do it for you so I'm
just going to reboot and show you that
now we have not only installed our RAM
but we have also configured it to work
properly
my next guide will probably be more like
our RAM overclocking and how to do that
because it's it's actually quite simple
you just turn the frequency up turn the
timings down and turn the voltage up
it's basically like CPU overclocking
more frequency more volts and then
profit so here you go everything is
going to be set the way it's supposed to
be and wasn't that fun thanks for
checking out my video blog and my guide
on installing and configuring your new
memory modules and a big thanks to
Kingston for providing this Ram don't
forget that if you are subscribed and
you leave a comment under my unboxing of
this kingston 6 gig kit then you can be
qualified to win it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
