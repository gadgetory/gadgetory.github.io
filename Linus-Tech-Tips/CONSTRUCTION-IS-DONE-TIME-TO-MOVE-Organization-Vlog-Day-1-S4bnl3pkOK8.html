actually though it's not moving vlog
because we are calling this organization
vlog because we're not actually moving
but the constructions done the new the
new office upstairs and the new
mezzanine under mezzanine area down here
they're ready to go which means that all
the chaos over here that we had to move
out of the way has to go back and this
time once and for all we are going to be
and stay organized right Colton
get yourself a cool t-shirt like the one
I'm wearing here through our merch store
with designed by humans learn more at
the link below
organizations beautiful right so much
time in the future yeah alright okay
okay great break see the frustrating
thing about this is there would be no
need for organization vlog if people at
least tried a little bit okay so goggles
ok goggles construction adhesive
let's see brand new clean a
reciprocating saw chemicals let's see
we've got a pink hot glue gun a brush
another brush so we're technically those
are technically everything's a chemical
get out of here I've got a film a video
so how is this all organized fractally
what do you do I'm going around and
putting painters tape on anything that
needs touch-ups on the wall what are you
doing being cute I'm actually not I just
got done I just got done getting pans of
every single room from every single
angle Edie and you caught me in a moment
of not doing anything for the last 10
seconds it was literally a 15-minute job
get back to work discovery work out what
Liv squat lift
got blackberries hmm what are you doing
what you'd like to work oh that's why we
can't trust you with things what do you
even do here
I just Kate what's going on have you
guys seen the new space have we already
done that so I've got the biggest office
the entire building my desk goes right
here cubicle to hide from the world I've
got my own kitchen no fridge what you're
gonna do is you're gonna move Luke all
of Luke's stuff into the blue office in
the new space you need to find him a
different desk though no will steal
Brandon's warehouse desk okay and
Brandon will have an L desk that desk
means nothing to me it's in that dark
corner well you're moving into here now
look there's fluorescent lights that you
love okay so Brennan and max are moving
into here but before they can move into
here John and Luke stuff need to move
upstairs so Luke is moving into the new
space and John is moving into where Nick
and Colton are right now how long before
nuke convergences into a bed and just
lives here is that a shower he's got a
kitchen okay Brandon what are you doing
for you oh good what a guy you're
welcome
just a snack eating a dick
detail you oh we just dust them off so I
would consider that suitable for our
first coat you know what's stupid we
might not even end up using the rollers
it beat the times actually like 80 I
wouldn't mess up my black suit otherwise
these are for the writers correct this
is my in progress projects area Oh make
sure you write like James has done you
know what's really unexpected to me that
I'm watching Colton pack up his stuff
he's not actually leaving Wow should I
throw away this kind of crap Linus this
is my sales department to I throw away
the money yeah totally
awesome hey WorkSafeBC session up folks
point psi higher than 50 no other human
beings disdain that's a whole hundred
psi over there okay you did that to me
earlier satisfaction about cleaning
thank you John
so Edie is on a lunch lazy bastard so
I'm holding the camera myself but I'm
working on moving our ingest stations
yes they no longer have to be in the
library and they're not going back out
to the office either they're actually
gonna move into what is now the camera
den but used to be the bench den
downstairs really well that'd be better
I guess that'll be less crowded in here
yeah well this is where the the VR
gaming PC is gonna go he's gonna start
moving stuff from the top shelf up there
into 101 hey you wanna catch boxes
funny how much easier was like that one
that's a lot of negativity that I don't
appreciate I'm putting the things and
the shelves no whose ball is it no some
call it a drying rack and yeah it's
totally splashed with like curry water
so I need to burn something he's
probably tearing through this probably
in a blink 10 yeah probably the
attention provigil way Devon can you get
a door stopper Alex's leadership skills
test and he is failing right now I think
this is working I thought you were gonna
throw it up wet thermal mass you need to
come check this out
I have no idea what thermal mass is
Terry what is the thermal mass so why
did you guys throw it above the fridge
and then have it rupture and then have
all of the water leak I didn't put them
in the cupboard that would have been the
fridge can we please throw out the
thermal mess yeah yeah but like no it's
leaking oh that is the one that we still
seems strong enough so if you're just
gonna live with it you could curry bowl
that is yet who's not owning up to this
I've got my bowl right here and I told
these guys I'm not the most recent
cutlery bandit I didn't have curry I
never have curry want a blackberry
whenever you send a package with this on
this is what people do with it okay so

Uline order in so we're gonna get a
bunch of fun things

have been why we got two of them this
all makes sense out of it Nick what you
been doing out there been wiping down
concrete dust off products and shelves

safe for us to breathe in yeah it's too
so it can't be any worse than the smoke
that's outside hey have we filmed you at
all yes we did you introduce yourself I
am a prime
that's perfect it's a little monotonous
but we liven it up with our imaginations
instead of being workers in a warehouse
wiping down boxes there were pirates in

slight improvement but it's an improve
our hey guys it's max the camera

wheels yeah that's like miscellaneous my
office can't be even the door is almost
the right height wait what's this that's
a sprinkler it's on fire okay
