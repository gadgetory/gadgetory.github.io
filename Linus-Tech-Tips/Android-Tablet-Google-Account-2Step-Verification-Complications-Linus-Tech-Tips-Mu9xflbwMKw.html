well they're setting up their Android
tablet now as you guys know one of our
although a couple of my Google accounts
were recently hijacked and this is
because I was not using 2-step
verification so 2-step verification
allows you whenever you're signing in
from any new device into your Google
account to have it prompt you by sending
you an SMS code so you can actually see
this SMS code if you want this isn't the
right one but see so it'll send you a
little text message that looks just like
that so I'm setting up a few different
tablets actually here you can just pan
over there have a look at some of the
tablets that I'm working on so I'm
setting all all these up so that I can
do some comparative testing which means
I gotta sign in to my Google accounts
took me about 15 minutes to get signed
in to the first one because here's what
I did I entered my email address I
entered my password I clicked sign-in
and I go oh Google account sign in
failure and this is the the problem is
the error it gives you the error it
gives you is wrong your username and
passwords do not match please try again
okay so I entered it again I was I
thought maybe I forget my password so I
went over to the computer I tried
signing in there all works so what's
going on here
so here's what you have to do if you're
if you are signing up on a new tablet
with your Google account is you go up
into the top corner here go to browser
sign in and sign in using the browser so
this one will work properly and then
it'll send you your verification SMS and
there will be no problems so there's a
little tech tip for you and now I'm
gonna get on with my tablet testing
