of phone for the money and I'm gonna
tell you all about it this video is
sponsored by honor
so really honors deal has kind of been
the same ever since the brand launched
and it's all about sort of more phone
for your dollar which isn't to say that
you like get more phones although I mean
if it's you know a quarter to a third of
the price of a flagship I guess you
could actually get more phones for your
dollar but most people probably wouldn't
do that they would just but they would
just buy one and anyway I don't know the
exact price of this yet so I do know the
price of the eight x-max
maybe in the yen but how well that
translates into u.s. dollars is yet to
be known so it's probably somewhere in
the 250 to 350 US Dollars range and what
you get for your money is looking pretty
good because especially if you're into
the whole phone as a fashion statement
thing with the honor 10 and with the 8x
they have put a lot of work into making
their devices really stand out which is
kind of funny because you think about
how upset Apple was all those years ago
about everyone's ripping off the the
plain black rectangle visual design of
the iPhone and then now you know whether
it's red or blue or you know kind of
iridescent colors or whatever it is
phone manufacturers are going out of
their way to not look like a plain black
rectangle but viewers of this channel
are probably less concerned with what it
looks like on the outside and more
concerned with what's going on on the
inside first though I should probably
mention the AI camera from the owner 10
is back so even though this uses a lower
spec Chiron processor the AI
functionality which is to say the
intelligent battery saving and object
recognition so whether it's a landscape
or an animal person food whatever the
case may be that is back so they'll be
trying to optimize the image based on
that we've got a rear fingerprint sensor
and then back around to the front so
what's kind of cool about this
particular processor so they
is the Chiron 710 is that it actually
uses almost the same CPU cores as the
970 so it still got an octa-core
processor with four stronger ones and
four weaker ones but it does have a
downgraded GPU so how much that
translates to actual performance though
I mean hey what's better than just
firing up an actual game and seeing how
it runs so I'm gonna whip up pop G here
and see how that goes way that I see it
your player should always be naked
because it is the mark of how well
you're doing in the match how much good
gear you can steal from other people I'm
actually so glad that the trend - if you
have to have bottom firing speakers
instead of having it on this side where
you're much more likely to be cupping it
with your palm I'm glad that the trend
is to put them on this side now oh
speaking of which there's a headphone
jack if you're into that sort of thing
it uses microUSB for charging and then
there's a bottom mounted speaker there
oh I think there's someone to fight up
here oh this sucks so I'm in the red
zone and oh it's eating at me oh dang it
where's this loser how can this guy not
kill me did I get it I want to run this
guy down right yet
actually pretty loud oh I was heavily
injured by bombs I'm still uh what why
do I know I saw that green gas that
comes out when I die
so while gaming isn't necessarily a
focus for this device
it didn't get crazy warm and it was
playable even if not the smoothest frame
raise so not a bad showing for something
that's really more about beefy CPU and
less about GPU also expansion options
are a nice touch here check this out so
we've got microSD expansion which honor
says is good for up to 400 gigs and two
sims and unlike some other devices out
there none of them are combo slots so
you can install all of those things at
the same time so I'm going to throw my
sim and my five hundred and twelve gig
microSD in here 512 gigs it's only rated
to 400 but yeah we'll see what happens
oh I was worried there it said
unsupported sd card on the notification
check that out but then you just have to
format it hopefully there's nothing
important on it so even though the
official support is only four hundred
gigs once again our 512 gig card is
supported thanks you can change the
default locations internal storage is
currently and blah blah etc all requires
a restart but you can actually change
the default storage location to your SD
card that's pretty cool
probably not necessary since it comes in
either 64 gigs or 128 gigs but it's nice
to have the option if you're a total
data hoarder so now the next thing I
want to see is there face unlock uses AI
now apparently to adapt for changing
conditions to lighting changes to kind
of the face you're making so what I want
to do is see if we can throw it for a
bit of a loop here so under normal
conditions okay that was pretty quick
you can tell from the lock at the top
here okay yep
cool now why don't we like kill one of
the lights or a couple of the lights
actually let's go ahead and boom unlock
okay
no problem so you can see it oh I don't
mind I was gonna say it takes a little
longer but it didn't on that one okay
now it's time to start making some faces
got it took it a little bit that time
huh got that one pretty easily not bad
actually
now of course facial recognition is less
secure than some other unlock methods
including a fingerprint scanner but it
does have one of those as well something
I'd like to see actually if anyone from
honors watching is a combo one like a
multi-factor so face scan and
fingerprint scan it would be harder to
defeat if you had to pass both of them
at the same time so one of the other key
features they're really touting for this
thing is the AI camera and one thing
stood out to me and that's that
apparently they're using multiple shots
and they're artificial intelligence
engine inside in order to sharpen and
stabilize low-light shots so as you guys
can see we're in a fairly dim area of
the set so we've got most of the lights
off for the land show and you can see
it's actually taking more shots that's
why that message comes up it's taking
more shots after you take your initial
picture in order to try and sharpen it
here's an interesting thing so here's an
iPhone 10's max for comparison of course
remember this costs three to four times
as much or whatever but it does manage
to retain more sharpness in the image
overall and I'd say the color is closer
to true life than this this goes for
more of like a vibrant poppy look but
there's certain elements like that hive
text for example that still manage to
come through really well on this camera
so the Razer logo actually has more
separation on the 8x than it does on the
iPhone 10s see that object and Scene
Recognition is back so it identified
that
it's overcast and optimized the
conditions for that you can see the sky
still has some blue in it maybe more
than is actually there but it all
depends on what you're after and then
also that we're taking a picture of a
car you know I'm actually curious do you
think it'll recognize my car as a car
hold on I'm gonna blank it out and then
let's see does it still know that that
messes the car Oh overhead come on baby
it's like no no this is not a vehicle
nobody should drive this ouch
every I was testing this before we turn
on the camera every other cars behind so
see check this out new car car fellas
car also car seat Ella's car also car
Dennis's car let's blank it out it's not
a car but that that's a car I drove that
thing for years okay so one of the big
things that honors touting with this
phone is how close the 19 and a half by
nine aspect ratio is to a cinematic 21
by 9 aspect ratio so you do still end up
with black bars but not nearly as big as
you'd otherwise be dealing with and yes
I'm one of those freaks who watches with
subtitles on whatever there's another
really cool thing I don't remember
exactly how they're doing it but you can
see they're actually not that far off
Apple's chin bar even though they can't
yet I don't remember if it's a patent or
an exclusive they can't yet use the same
tech that Apple's using in the 10 and
the 10s so you end up with very little
bezel to speak of and you're watching
cinematic content so really there's no
surprises with the 8x but that's not
necessarily a terrible thing so what
you're getting is a whole lot of phone
for the dollar so it's got 4 gigs round
3750 milliamp hour battery which with
their power optimization from my
experience should give you a heck of a
lot of battery life and of course strong
CPU even if it's kind of a middling
GPU and all for a very reasonable price
thanks to honor for not only sponsoring
this video but also giving away to honor
phones to two lucky winners in the
hashtag cheer for honor 8x giveaway so
