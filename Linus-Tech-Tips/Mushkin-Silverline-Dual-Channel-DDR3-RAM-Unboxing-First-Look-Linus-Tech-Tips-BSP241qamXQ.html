unboxing RAM RAM is kind of RAM but one
thing that I do like to unbox is new Ram
heat spreaders that I haven't seen
before because heat spreaders for all of
their aesthetics only sort of value can
matter I mean personally I bought a
particular set of RAM for my machine
based on heat spreaders because i really
liked them and obviously the price was
good too so this is an example of a
product that has a great price and kind
of a neat looking heat spreader so this
is the mishkan silverline line of memory
so it features their silver line heat
spreader which as you can see is a line
of silver from the top so it has a very
shiny finish on it you've got the
mishkan muskan however you wish to
prance that I'm going to put my hand
here so it'll focus there you go much
can enhance branding on the top there
and this is a two piece heat spreader so
it folds over right here at this corner
so one of the pieces I'm gonna see if I
can get to focus there for you guys I'm
sorry so one of the pieces there we are
so one of the pieces goes over the top
and the other ones only on the side all
right you can see the adhesive material
in there that sticks on to the RAM chips
can't really see the RAM chips from this
angle well it looks like this is a one
sided dim that's actually a spacer so
this is a one sided dim but the heat
spreader means that you can't really
tell and it's installed in your system
so you just got a plain gray background
that the nice shiny silver action is
quite nice I like it there you are and
one of the reasons I bring this up is
that the silver line is one of the most
aggressively priced lines of memory on
the market right now this is a 1333 c9
nice low voltage 1.5 volt kit that is
just like stupidly priced if you head
over to NCIX right now a lot of them are
so this is a 2 by 2 gig but silver line
comes in two by two gig three by two big
two by eight four gig three by four gig
and various speed so thank you for
checking out my yes I know entirely
pointless unboxing of the musk in silver
line ram and don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips hopefully you can
check out this video and
that will give you some idea of what
this Ram is going to look like love that
silver finish on the top that the mush
can enhanced branding their looks good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
