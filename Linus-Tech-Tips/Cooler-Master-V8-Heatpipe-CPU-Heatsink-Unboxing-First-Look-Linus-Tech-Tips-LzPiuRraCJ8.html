unboxing of the Coolermaster v8 cpu
heatsink it is a 180 watt cooling
solution which is basically overpowered
for all but the most overclocked CPUs so
it's going to be able to keep you cool
etc etc you should experience the power
of v8 it is compatible to core i7 core
i5 core i3 and a m3 and remember that
anything that is a m3 compatible is also
by extension compatible with a m2 and m2
plus because they all use the same
mounting hole so they'll actually know
there is more on the box let's actually
have a closer look at the box here so
Coolermaster Piedra horsepower any high
performance cpu four separate modular
sets of aluminum fins create a large
heat dissipation surface eight heat
pipes maximize heat transfer so that's
probably where the v8 comes from it has
a center mounted 120 millimeter fan
which I've always thought is kind of a
smart way to do the design and I'll show
you that when we get inside okay and
then you've also got quiet operation at
17 to 21 decimals I mean those are
basically the only important things
about a CPU heatsink the looks the heat
dissipation and the noise level I mean I
don't know maybe there's something other
than actually you know what no that's
not the only thing one really important
thing is that I just got the seals on
this side and then try to open it from
the other side why is this not working I
will have to find out how do I look okay
one of the other really important things
is the mounting system and you can tell
when the manufacturer is cheaped out on
the mounting system this does not look
to be a case of keeping out on the
mounting system you can see that all of
these parts are made of like quality
looking steel okay so you can't expect
any of this to like bend or anything
like that okay so you can see we've got
a multi backplate here this backplate is
set up for a m2 it didn't actually it
looks like it even has nine three nine
holes so I'm not I'm not sure how many
people would be mounting something like
this on socket 939 but there you go
and then you've got LGA 775 11 56 and
1366 so that's how you get compatibility
for all the different Intel Core
processors there's some kind of cheesy
looking thermal compound that I probably
wouldn't recommend using and some tools
just in case you need tools to install
this heatsink awesome let's get to the
more interesting part and that is the v8
itself which is huge okay a user's
manual actually there you should talk
about this first - so Coolermaster seems
to be including Wow pretty detailed user
manual showing you all of the parts that
should come with your v8 and giving you
step-by-step instructions in about three
hundred and forty two different
languages including English a bunch of
stuff I can't read German Spanish and
French okay awesome it looks to be about
a six step five to six step installation
procedure so that's pretty
straightforward I guess and then on the
back Wow even more languages cool so
anyone living in any one of those
countries can install this heatsink
assuming that they can read okay then we
have the warranty information which is
also in a billion in one different
languages a two year warranty there you
go okay so here is the v8 coming out of
its clamshell feels kind of like the
Darth Vader helmet but if there is tape
and I couldn't see it so now I have cut
the tape and there we go now we are
extracting it from the cooling you know
what this isn't actually as big as I was
expecting it to be it looked like it was
going to be like way huger than this
okay so let's have a look first from the
side so you can see that as they as
advertised it has four separate heat
thin segmented parts that are all
connected by heat pipes to the base I'm
not sure what the actual technical
cooling advantages are of that but there
must be something Coolermaster has been
doing this for a very long time
okay so then you've got your twenty five
millimeter fan in the middle now the 25
mil fan is blowing this way so that
means that any air coming in from this
side is cooling the base and then the
air gets heated up a little bit and then
gets blown out the other side and is
also cooling the base so they're able to
make use of not only the push air coming
out of the fan but also the pull air
coming into the fan from the other side
I think this is really smart and we're
seeing a lot more heat sinks these days
coming out with designs like this from
the top and I mean this comes down to
aesthetics personally I really like this
I think
it's very stylish-looking you got your
Coolermaster logo with a shiny v8
letters a shiny letters whatever anyway
it looks kind of cool it looks kind of
like an engine component or some kind of
like high-end sort of feature cool thing
okay i'm sort of lacking english today
but i think you get the point and then
let's get down to the base itself so you
can see we have eight count them one two
three four five six seven eight
discrete heat pipes so it comes out to
like sixteen coming out pretty much okay
carrying heat up to the taller parts of
the heatsink and then we have you can do
the obligatory shiny shot oh i can't
hold this in one hand like that i don't
have a good grip okay there we go so
there we can show how shiny the base is
really the shininess is not always
relative relevant because the most
important thing is how flat it is
because flatness is what's going to give
your heat conductivity not shininess so
thank you for checking out my oh no no
not done okay we have a sleeved black
four pin fan connector here so that's a
pwm fan inside that's kind of neat to
see because most motherboards do support
it these days and then I finally figured
out what this pci bracket in the
mounting hardware box is for lohi so you
can actually take this off somehow
there's probably some way to do it and
you put this switch into the back of
your computer and you can adjust the
dial here for how fast you want the fan
to run that's kind of nice to have and
it's kind of a cool looking shiny switch
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of the cooler master v8</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
