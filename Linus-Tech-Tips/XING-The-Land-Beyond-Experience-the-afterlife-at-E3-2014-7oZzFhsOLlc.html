brought to you by hyperx fury series
high-performance SSDs the Corsair
Vengeance k70 and k90 RGB mechanical
keyboards and NCIX com our trusted
retailer for high-performance gaming pcs
alright guys i'm here at the IndieCade
checking out xing the land beyond with
coryell what can you tell me about this
game what is this game alright so a zing
is a first-person puzzle adventure for
the pc and we have it today on the
oculus rift as well um I mean seeing is
a story about the afterlife and what
happens is that you're dead and you have
to try to find out you know who you are
and why you're there and you solve a lot
of different puzzles go to a lot of
fantastical environments and meet
different spirits along the way in order
to uncover who you are basically right
so when I was playing immediate
references came to mind to missed it
feels like I'm on some sort of Island
I'm not entirely sure I'm solving
puzzles all the time one thing I really
appreciate it too is I noticed a lot of
people when they're trying to integrate
with oculus go for like these
first-person shooter games and finally
we're getting like an environmentally
pleasing kind of adventure puzzle game
which is actually really cool how did
you think of making this um so actually
this started out as a college project in
a classroom the three of us just met in
college and we decided to make a game
like this and we started on just on the
pc and then we wanted to make something
really really pretty and and fun and
fantastical and then I mean oculus rift
came came out and was like huge and we
had a Kickstarter and then everyone is
like put it on the rift and we're like
all right we're gonna do it you know and
and I mean it fits so perfectly so we
just thought you know why not I mean
it's a fantastic new medium definitely I
played with the oculus I didn't play
with keyboard and mouse but I can't
imagine it would be difficult in any way
it was very cool playing with the oculus
too because like i said it's very
environmental kind of adventure go
around check things out kind of game and
it was immersive and it's beautiful what
kind of engine you guys running the
center did you guys do it yourself or
how does that work yeah so I'm right now
we're actually running it in the unreal
4 engine we switched over to unreal for
about two months ago
before that we were working in UDK and
epic has been extremely supportive the
entire time oculus has been extremely
supportive the entire time so we're just
really happy that you know we're getting
lots of kudos and people telling us to
continue right that's really cool so
what what like I can tell you're deeply
connected with the game what is your
favorite part of this game what brings
you towards this game wow I haven't
actually been asked that question before
but that's a good one um I'd say my
favorite part of this game is the fact
that I've been working on it for two
years and the the fact that I play it
like every day every week and I'm still
not bored of it and I still love playing
it yeah that's a that's a good answer
and that's very cool I don't want to
actually ask way too many questions
because this game seems more of like an
experience i'd highly suggest you guys
check it out when would someone be able
to their hands on this so we're looking
to release at the end of this year so it
should be 2014 release um don't quote me
on that but but but we're really trying
like we've been pushing and honestly I
mean we're still on target for that so
it should be good great and then is it
like Steam greenlight or what platform
yeah so we were steamed green lit last
October and so will be there will
probably be on GOG Desura as well and
you know there's a couple other
platforms we might be looking at two
probably after release cool awesome so
again I highly suggest you guys check it
out if you want to see all the rest of
our III content be sure to subscribe
