the a sous-vide Oh book this particular
one is the S 400 C which is I don't know
something basically it's a vivo book so
the idea is that it's kind of like a
lower-cost version of a very slim and
light notebook that is also from a Seuss
the Zen book and yeah that just comes in
it kind of a kind of a lower lower price
point I mean this one's around 600 bucks
comes with eco-friendly packaging which
I do like to see remember guys foam
there's pretty much no way to break it
down so yeah it's it's a very very bad
thing so it's not as thin as a Zen book
but it's still in a very sort of slim
beautiful form factor with brushed metal
on the top that looks absolutely
gorgeous actually that that's fantastic
it's considering again the sort of the
value price point of this model so we're
going to put that down for now and we'll
talk specs it's not an ultrabook because
it doesn't sort of fall inside in tells
you know oh it is an ultrabook
my bad okay it is an ultrabook which
means it does fall within intel
specification meaning it has the
anti-theft technology it has all the
appropriate chipsets so it has to have
an Intel wireless chipset it has to meet
a certain specification in terms of
weight and thickness precise I think the
reason that I thought it wasn't an
ultrabook
was because it's a little thicker than
most ultra books but that is because the
Ultrabook specification does allow
notebooks that are larger so that is the
diagonal the diagonal length across the
screen to be thicker because they just
have to be larger machines and you don't
want to compromise the rigidity and the
build quality of the machine just to get
sort of you know a little bit of extra a
little okay you wouldn't call it extra
thinness it's more like less thickness
so we're going to go ahead and fire it
up move touchscreen - this is actually
sort of an outstanding notebook comes
with asus is 360 coverage so i just want
you guys to check this out two-year
international war
- that means even if you take it
somewhere else you're not going to get
any hassle something goes wrong zero
Brite guarantee on the LCD so Asus will
replace it for you they cover to weight
free standard shipping for warranty
repairs and 24/7 technical support it
looks like this particular one doesn't
include the accidental damage that they
used to include you know what we should
double check this and find out for you
though it does not include accidental
damage like some of the higher-end
models do but I've got a it's a lower
end model so I guess it is what it is at
least you have the international
warranty which i think is one of the
biggest things and free two-way shipping
actually is pretty good too because the
industry standard is that the
manufacturer will pay to ship it back to
you but you pay to ship it to them in
the first place so I haven't actually
gone through specs so let's just have a
quick look here so it runs a core i5
3317 you although this particular the
s400 shell is available in a variety of
different cpu configs this particular
one has a 500 gig SATA drive with a 24
gig and SSD so I think they mean M SATA
SSD that's being used as a cache which
does actually make the device feel
dramatically snappier in my experience
it's a 14 inch screen it is a
touchscreen screen which i think is
pretty much a must on any notebook these
days it comes with 6 gigs of RAM for
this particular model although some of
the different ones do not doesn't have
fingerprint doesn't have TV it runs a
1366 by 768 resolution and runs Windows
8 64-bit I wish we've been able to get
rid of the whole 64 bit 32-bit things
earlier on but I didn't get my way with
all of that so there you go
they've gone with a different shape for
their power brick for this generation
here so we've got the same sort of cable
running to a power brick running to
another cable set up that we've seen
before just like this but they've just
changed the shape a little bit I mean
this might make it a little bit easier
to okay this doesn't come off for
anything easier to like coil up or
easier to tuck away in something but I
don't see it making that much of a
difference I no longer have an iPhone 4
so I'll be doing my HTC 8x size
comparison for those of you who don't
know how big an 8x is it's very similar
in size to a Galaxy s3
so that should give you a better idea of
how big the power brick actually is now
let's have a look at the notebook itself
it actually reminds me a lot of like in
terms of just the overall the overall
finish of it the overall look at the
keyboard especially of something like
like a macbook where it has a very very
solid feel it's not a unibody design by
any stretch of the imagination but look
at this you actually really can't see a
lot of flex to the keyboard itself so
you can see from the pressure on my
fingers how much pressure I'm actually
putting on the unit but there's really
not a lot of flex to it so typing should
be very comfortable on the chiclet
keyboard that's included just because
the thing that really bothers me with a
lot of laptop keyboards is how mushy
they can get when you're trying to type
on them for long periods whereas this
one doesn't have any Wow it doesn't have
any much to it at all that's very
comfortable build quality is
surprisingly good again considering
considering the price point normally
when you get into those sort of six
seven hundred dollar notebooks you end
up with something that has a lot of like
a lot of give but here so I'll do my
usual twist test where I'm seeing how
much you can actually bend it which is
one of the surest ways to know if a
notebook is is well built or not so on
this side we find USB 3 HDMI out VGA out
which I still like to see included
Gigabit Ethernet using one of those
little flap ethernet jacks power in on
the back you find not a whole lot on the
other side you find a Kensington lock
two USB 2.0 ports a headphone microphone
Jack wouldn't have minded seeing
discrete jacks for that an SD card
reader and then on the front you've got
not a whole lot of much of anything on
the bottom you just find a Windows 8
sticker as well as some ventilation
holes the CPU is clocked only
out-of-round
I think it's under one gigahertz when
you're idling anyway so I don't wouldn't
worry too much about that fan being very
loud at all this one's come with no
charge unfortunately so I can't power it
up right now
but I can give you guys a better look at
the back so it doesn't include a
microfiber cloth unfortunately but I
think I have one around here somewhere
yeah we'll just go with that so I just
want you guys to see sort of what the
back of it looks like
did you get any good footage of that
diesel I'm sort of getting a I'm getting
a quizzical look so they're just that's
what the back let's say it's again it
looks very very premium considering the
price points of the shiny Asus logo the
brush finish it's not quite black like
it's almost like a very deep brown so it
it looks black at first glance but then
once you look at it from sort of a
different angle it has sort of like a
very very dark wood finish sort of look
to it I actually really really like it
yeah diesel says classy thank you that's
probably the word I was looking for
actually it should be noted right
thickness I never showed you guys the
overall thickness so here we're going to
do the foam thickness comparison as well
just to show you that while it is a
little bit thicker than a smaller
Ultrabook because it's a 14-inch model
you do get to get away with a little bit
more thickness and still keep that
Ultrabook title however it should be
noted that the touchscreen itself adds a
lot of weight and a lot of bulk to the
screen typically because it's an entire
extra layer in there that you have to
add in order to get the touchscreen
functionality so staying within that
spec and adding a touchscreen at this
price point is very impressive
it has sonic master audio so that should
mean that in theory the notebook has
better audio than other comparable
notebooks that don't have any kind of
sort of attention paid to the audio so
it's got stereo speakers here and here
and according to sort of what I've seen
anecdotally people have been saying that
yes it does indeed sound better than
sort of most notebooks that are this
thin so that's good to know I think that
pretty much wraps it up thank you for
