peripherals has the features you need to
win at a price you like click now to
learn more welcome to my long overdue
unboxing of one of the most important
SSDs on the market this is the 840 Evo
it is not the fastest SSD it's not the
cheapest SSD but what it is is the
complete package it's available in
pretty much any capacity 120 250 500 750
and one terabyte they are all reasonably
aggressively priced and because of some
unique features that Samsung's
implemented extremely competitive
performance wise in spite of the very
middle card wear specs so that's a bold
claim Linus why would you say that and
the answer will come later on in the
video have to sit let me talk about
other stuff so first up hardware specs
they have shrunk the manufacturing
process down to we think 19 nanometer
but they're calling it 1x class
nanometers which means that prices have
come down versus the last generation
product they are still using PLC NAND
flash so that is three bit per cell mlc
flash making the data densities higher
than what other guys who are using two
bit per cell LLC even in their
entry-level drives are using but because
Samsung has made some changes to their
already excellent MDX controller so it's
now the NEX
three Core controller they are able to
achieve great performance in spite of
the inherently much slower write speeds
that TLC flash has to work with so it's
also got say 23.1 over sata3 on the last
generation product and they've added
hardware aes-256 encryption so that's
basically there see there's a code on
the back of this drive so that's
basically a way to make it so someone's
completely locked out of your drive
unless they're willing to completely
erase it so you can secure your data
even from theft in the event that
someone actually gets your drive and
they can't even put it in anywhere else
and unlock it so endurance is of course
the big thing people talk about with PLC
flash because not only does it write
slower
it also doesn't write as many times
every SSD will die it actually has a
rated number of writes that will
eventually kill it now most SSDs will
actually last much longer than that rate
right speed and you can see they've done
some extreme testing over on Xtreme
systems go figure they do extreme
testing there I just don't think it's
that important even if it didn't last
any longer than the rated number of
right cycles you look at an excellent
comparison by a non tech so that'll be
linked in the video description huge a
non tech fanboy over here if you guys
didn't already know that they estimate
that even with a very aggressive
workload these drives which are the
consumer grade drives are going to be
lasting for years depending on the
capacity now the larger the capacity of
the drive the longer it's going to last
to the point where you're looking at
drives that are probably going to last
for decades or die from some other
reason rather than die from being
written to too many times and it should
also be noted that SSDs are much less
likely to be damaged by shock or any
other kind of physical you know demise
that hard drives can meet because they
don't have any moving parts now let's
get into that bold claim that I made
about why this drive which has TLC flash
you know a faster clocked three core
controller 400 megahertz versus 300
megahertz and you know otherwise isn't
that special is the drive to beat and
three things turbo right rapid and their
new data migration to software so what
turbo write is is a way of taking part
of the storage on the drive and it
varies according to the capacity of your
particular drive it goes up as you have
more capacity and takes part of that TLC
flash and runs it in SLC mode so if
you're not familiar with SLC that means
only one bit per cell all right so
that's even potentially faster than MLC
back when that was the performance and
long endurance what an NL C was the
redheaded stepchild whereas now it's
high-performance mlc and then plc as the
one that is you know perceived as less
reliable and slower so what that means
is that when the drive gets written to
it fills up that that SLC behaving cache
first then distributes that data to the
rest of the drive at its leisure that
means that in real world terms the drive
is faster unless you're doing a very
long sustained write to it now reads are
still fine on TLC flash so turbo write
has pretty much no drawback in a
day-to-day usage scenario which is very
very cool you can enable it using
samsung's SSD Magicians software
it's very fast very low latency but it
does rely again on non continuous use so
again I'm in a non tech fanboy guys and
you can check out their excellent
article on turbo write which is linked
in the video description as well next up
is rapid which stands for fast no
actually it stands for real time
accelerated processing of i/o data and
what rapid does is it allows you to take
a gig of your DRAM so that is your
system memory and use that to catch the
SSD now this one I'm not quite sure if I
feel as you know are completely positive
about as I do about turbo right because
it caches not only reads but also writes
which means that if your system does
lose power in the middle of it caching
something into memory this is not the
same as caching to SLC flash which is
still going to be there when the system
reboots and the power goes down memory
is cleared when the power goes out so it
can cause data corruption but if you're
running on a laptop or anything else
that has a battery backup such as a
desktop with a UPS and your system is
very stable I wouldn't worry about it
too too much so what it does is it takes
up to a gig of your system memory and
allows it to operate many times faster
than even the fastest SSD can because it
is effectively reading and writing out
of RAM it's not the same as a ram disk
implementation because it's all
completely uh it's all completely
automated unlike Ram disk software which
often requires a lot of manual
intervention the next one up is data
migration to so what that allows you to
do is say ok well I bought this new SSD
but I could only afford a 250 gig SSD
and quite frankly the hard drive that I
bought like four years ago is already
500 gigs and I've got all this data on
it what am I supposed to do if I migrate
it over what am I
videos and photos and songs just lost in
the ether of the answer is no what data
migration to does is it allows you to
specify two targets so you can clone
your OS and all the important programs
and stuff over to an SSD and then you
can have a secondary hard drive that all
your data goes to so it's actually
painless enough to use that even my
mother can do it so we're going to do a
follow-up video on rapid the data
migration to software as well as turbo
right that's going to be hosted by slick
but basically without even watching that
all you need to know is this drive just
pretty much rocks
thank you for checking out my unboxing
an overview of the Samsung 840 Evo don't
forget to like this video if you liked
it dislike it if you dislike it leave a
comment if you have something to say to
me how much did Samsung pay you to make
this video believe it or not sometimes I
just like stuff I'm allowed to do that
