category in tech these days TVs phones
computers and you could make the
argument that the pace of technological
advancement has slowed and they've
gotten boring but here's one that's
really exciting sub $1000 gaming laptops
these days compared to even models from
a couple of years ago are amazing and
the new generation of Nvidia graphics
cards is a big part of the reason so the
GTX 1650 mobile GPU is actually priced
the same as the outgoing 1050 Ti but
it's got a fair bit more power under the
hood so if you're a cheap gamer or even
just someone who cares about getting
good value for your dollar we think you
should give the Acer nitro 7 and
especially the Nitro 5 are really good
look so let's talk about what they did
right and what they left out to keep
these budget beasts affordable speaking
of affordable private Internet access
that's exactly what you'll get with PIAA
a safe and protected IP and it's got
loads of other features as well check it
out at the link in the video description
the look of the Nitro five is a bit
divisive although the overall feel of
the machine is pretty good and I
appreciate the much smaller bezels the
red accents on the keyboard and the
trackpad along with loads of plastic
make the Nitro v look a bit Thai like
it's better endowed cousin the Nitro 7
improves on this a bit with a slightly
more premium screen backing and less red
but it still falls into the trap of
looking like something that a high
schooler might think looks pretty dope
on both models you'll find heaps of i/o
they've got four USB ports including one
type seat along with headphones full
size HDMI and Ethernet which you
thankfully won't need too often since
unlike the zephyrus G a 502 the 2019
nitro lineup includes 2x2 Wi-Fi cards by
default of course those are minor
details and after that intro what
everyone wants to know is what kind of
performance we can squeeze out of an
$800 laptop well good news the GTX 1650
put on a really good show easily doling
out 60fps at 1080p in every game we
tried without sacrificing too much eye
candy compared to the GTX 1050 Ti we're
actually looking at about a 20%
improvement across the board now that's
not enough to make for a completely
different experience from last gen but
it is definitely noticeable so games
that previously were best played on
medium settings can now comfortably be
set to high those frames don't matter
though if there isn't a good display
panel to show them on and at first it
seemed like the Nitro 7 was going to
come away with an easy win here its
8-bit panel is brighter has richer
colors and maybe even higher contrast
than the 6 bit panel found on the Nitro
5 but it turns out the Nitro 5 has an
ace up its sleeve when we tried
overclocking the display panels using
custom resolution utility the Nitro 7
tapped out where most laptops do
slightly above 60 Hertz the Nitro 5 on
the other hand just kept going and going
all the way up to a whopping 90
now I don't want to guarantee that your
nitro five will be able to display that
many frames per second this is way
beyond the official spec and a sir could
be sourcing panels from multiple vendors
but on ours games like overwatch or
Rainbow six siege appear noticeably
smoother for a tangible competitive
advantage now if you've got a mixed
workload that includes some hobbyist
level photo or video editing the Nitro
seven would still be a better bet but if
you primarily plan on gaming in our mind
the Nitro 5 is the clear choice here
above the screens you'll find a webcam
which a Saran says super high dynamic
range it looks a little something like
this I wouldn't exactly describe it as
super but hey at least they've got one
zing this is what's more impressive
though is the speakers which got pretty
loud and have a nice full sound you know
that's another thing that has really
improved a lot on budget gaming laptops
right back to performance if you do plan
on using either of these for content
creation or professional purposes the
internal displays on either them might
not be perfect for that but there's
always the option of hooking up to an
external one for color critical work so
we checked it out the i5 processor in
our nitro 5 was very well behaved it
turbo DUP - about 4 gigahertz settling
in at 3 gigahertz upon all 4 course that
is well above base clock but the i7
model was actually pretty disappointing
when we put it under an all core load
the thermals were fine but it
immediately ran up against a power limit
and settled in below its base clock at
2.4 gigahertz when hit with the
demanding load now thanks to its two
extra cores and its higher boost it's
still the better processor out of the 2
but if we're gonna call out Apple 4
under building their machines then Acer
needs to expect the same treatment
silver lining at least this lack of
adequate power delivery means that
neither laptop gets exceptionally loud
under load both laptops are equipped
with the same keyboard and
it's fine just like it was two years ago
but in light of recent competition we
think that Acer needs to seriously think
about upgrading their keyboards across
the entire lineup it's still not
terrible but the keystrokes are a bit on
the heavy side with very little in the
way of tactility so if you're able to
justify the price jump to a Zephyrus
g502 or an alienware m15 your fingers
will thank you when you're writing long
emails about why you couldn't finish
your assignment because you were busy
gaming as for the trackpad it's also
fine fortunately acer is using the
windows precision drivers but the
chassis flex around the trackpad makes
the clicks feel a bit mushy again an
area where I'll accept it today
especially at this price point but Acer
needs to consider improving it for next
year the 55 watt hour battery found in
the nitro 5 and 7 is about what you'd
expect in this price range and since the
components aren't too power-hungry and
actually the screens on both are a bit
on the dim side you can actually use the
Nitro 5 away from the wall for close to
8 hours if you're just surfing the web
with the nitro 7 coming in closer to 7
both laptops feature great upgrade
ability with easy access to ram 2m to
drive slots and space for a 2 and a half
inch drive so we love this because it
means you don't have to sweat it when
you don't have a ton of money today so
you select an 8 gig ram 128 gig storage
option hoping that you'll have more
money when you finish your program and
you can expand it later so then with
that in mind should you actually buy
either of these laptops
well the 830 dollar price tag on the
Nitro 5 is really hard to complain about
and if you want a game on a budget the
90 Hertz display overclock will give you
a surprisingly good experience if you
get a golden unit like ours so that one
is coming out of this review with a
full-blown recommendation as for the
Nitro 7 although the panel is better
it's a tougher sell given that the i7
model struggles with performance
crippling power issues now it's possible
that everything else at this price point
will have the same problems so I'm gonna
end up saying well pick your poison but
I kind of doubt it and we're gonna know
for certain soon an
when Dell sends over their new g3
speaking of sending over why not get a
dis plate sent over to you
this plate is posters made out of metal
they're three millimeters thick with
bent edges so you won't cut yourself
they've got a matte finish so they look
really clean and they use this amazing
magnetic wall mounting system that makes
it simple to swap them in and out and
doesn't require putting any holes in
your wall they've got tons of different
arts with over 15,000 artists
contributing over a quarter million
total designs and with each displayed
sold they plant 10 trees they offer
hassle-free returns
they're already gift packed and you can
use code LTT to save 15% at the link in
the video description so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link below also
down there's our merch store which
finally has the stealth hoodie this one
