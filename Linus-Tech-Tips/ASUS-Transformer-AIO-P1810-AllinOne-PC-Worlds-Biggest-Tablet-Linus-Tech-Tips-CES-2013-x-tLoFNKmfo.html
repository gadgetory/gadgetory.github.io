cool stuff so one and two are some
all-in-one PCs with Windows 8 and some
touchscreen functionality and that's
very very good stuff but the real big
winner right here is the transformer a
IO P 1810 welcome to Linus tech tips at
CES 2013 our trip to the show this year
is powered by Corsair maker of quality
PC components and peripherals our
trusted storage partner is Seagate
technology and our trusted networking
partner is Linksys
so check this out guys it's an
all-in-one PC so there's a core i5
computer here you got your slot load
optical you got your dongle for your
keyboard and mouse what else you got
here it's got some heft to it it's got
some weight feels quality nice metal
base beautiful on the side here check
that out
four USB 3.0 ports SD card as well as
your microphone headphone Kensington
lock there's an additional Kensington
lock that's the first hint guys that's
the first hint there's a separate
Kensington lock for this why did they do
this why are they calling it dual system
Android Windows 8 well I'll show you why
because it is a full multi-touch Windows
8 machine it has an IPS panel here
that's 18 point 4 inches of his full HD
it has sonic master audio and if you
just go like this it is the world's
largest tablet wait for it live for it
and did I break it
ok guys it looks like I messed it up a
little bit last time but you can see it
running as the world's largest Android
tablet I mean come on let's do it let's
do our traditional iPhone size
comparison here guys yeah that's right
that's how big this thing is so I had I
didn't realize there's a magic blue
button that makes everything that you
see possible so all you got to do is
align it with the base station this
Android tablet running Tegra 3.1 you
press the Voodoo button here and boom
you're running a Windows 8 all-in-one PC
you take it off and there's going to be
a mode later that communicates through
Wi-Fi that allows you to use it as a
Windows 8 tablet wirelessly
communicating with the base station or
it has its own dedicated hardware inside
remember Tegra 3 point one processor to
run as an all out Android tablet so this
is this is just friggin cool at this
point so check out what we've got for
i/o there's your power
there's your headphone microphone all in
one Jack there's your micro SD USB Vudu
button as I said before volume powered
on the bottom you've got a dock
connector that again that must be like
the Vudu dock connector because there is
some
magic going on with this product right
here nothing on the other side except
that Kensington lock we showed you
before and you're all out Android tablet
goodness so you know portrait mode like
I mean think of it think of it this way
guys you know you're you're uh sorry oh
oh yeah there's a stand - don't worry
I'll show the stand so think about this
guys you're sitting on the couch your
visions not so good anymore you want to
read a book or you want to read a web
page yeah this is probably the way to do
it sit with your you know your you know
cat see up close anymore you want to
move a little bit further away no big
deal you want basically at I mean 1080p
TV but you can sit in bed with and watch
your movies and then you know
tuck under your nightstand when you're
done this is pretty much it is it
portable is it something you want to
take with you on the bus I would suggest
that perhaps you do not want to use it
that way but as far as versatile devices
go you get the windows experience you
get the Android experience remember you
can run Android when you're on here just
press the magic button and magic happens
and last but not least it has an
integrated stand and handle so check
this out do like this because I mean
yeah it's a little bit on the heavy side
I don't know if you'd want to well I
mean you could walk around the house
with it let me check this up you're like
yeah I'm watching a video I don't want
to stop so I'm going to just kind of put
this on here I'm gonna wash my dishes
watch my video put this right here I'm
gonna get some ice and like I don't know
