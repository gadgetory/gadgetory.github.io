3140 I thought you know what I've
actually got a monitor sitting around
that would be perfect to just install on
it so that we can actually see what it
looks like so this is a older Easter
19-inch widescreen monitor not
particularly exceptional in any way but
it's perfect for something like this now
another thing I didn't show is the
hardware included with the MIB series
case so here give me two seconds here
I'm just going to put this down so
really dusty you okay so then you've got
some hard drive screws those are
included and then you've also got all
the screws that you need to install the
mother stole the motherboard install the
monitor onto the case so here let me
just check what the orientation of this
is going to be want to make sure okay
there's a little clip on the back and
show you this really quick see this so
you just pull this aside and push down
and then the arm extends and then for
this one gee I don't actually know how
to unlock this one I did the cameraman
with the song here cuz I bet you did it
wrong cameraman always does things wrong
oh no it's just really stiff oh there we
go okay so there that's oh okay cool
that's much better now okay so I just
want to check the orientation of this
thing once I've got it on to make sure
that I'm putting it on the right way so
that I can actually get the screws
through and Fred them into something I
guess it goes yeah my guess is that it
goes this way and then must go on like
this or maybe it goes on through it like
this ah there we go can you tell I've
never done this before ok so first thing
we'll do is find the appropriate screws
which I believe are these ones and then
we will Oh
don't worry i found it it's all good and
I even have tools to get checked out and
so will screw this in to the back of the
monitor so yeah we got those holes lined
up like nobody's business i'm just going
to put in two so that you're not just
sitting around waiting for me to install
screws to follow up the conclusion of
the video so we'll just do that guy and
then we'll do the top right one I think
that'll be enough to hold this monitor
it's actually rated for up to 22 inches
this is arms are so this is only a 19
inch monitor so this is only going to be
a small amount of the capabilities of
this little system here so oh wow here
we go so I want you to be able to see
this from the back so I'll slide the
monitor on go just like that no kind of
like that that's on point there we go
and then you take these two big screws
and put those in from the back and that
is how long it takes to install the
monitor onto this case takes like six
screws assuming you're doing it
correctly although I used only for and
then just like that so now that I've
actually got a monitor on it it's much
easier to move around because it's got
its got quite a bit of uh quite a bit of
stiffness to it so that when you have a
monitor on you have all this leverage it
doesn't move too easily so there you go
so you set this up just like that you
got your keyboard and mouse and there's
your complete pc so thank you for
checking out my how to install a monitor
guide for the mi BTW 3140 so we showed
the vertical adjustment as well as the
tilt adjustment but wait there's more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
