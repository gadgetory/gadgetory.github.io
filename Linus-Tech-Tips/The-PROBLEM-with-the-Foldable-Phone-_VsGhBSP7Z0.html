by D brand the D brand grip and their
prism screen protector are a great way
to keep your phone from getting damaged
in the event of an accidental drop or
here's another idea this right here is
the royal flex PI the world's first
commercially available phone with a
flexible AMOLED display now I'm sure you
guys have a lot of questions and so did
I but the good news is I have actually
gotten the answers for most of them so
stay tuned because there are some things
about this that are really cool and
there are some things about this that
are a little bit less cool so they
started out in 2012 but this is actually
their first phone they've been hard at
work on this for years and they actually
had to build their own fabrication and
production line in order to make this a
reality and it started with the world's
thinnest display so they claimed that
the actual display layer of their tech
here is just point zero one millimeters
thick and this was absolutely critical
to getting it to be flexible enough that
it could not just be bent in a tight
radius like this but it could do so
200,000 times without being damaged the
trick here is that while flexible OLED
technology has been around for a long
time the substrate is the part that's
the challenge because traditionally you
would build it on to glass and finding a
plastic that is also both thin and
flexible and durable both whatever don't
worry about it enough is a real
challenge now they couldn't really give
me any details as to exactly what
plastic they're using but it seems to be
working incredibly well now in terms of
the operating system in specs
it's running Snapdragon 850 five six or
eight gigs of ram 128 or 256 gigs of
storage
a customized version of Android that
they're calling water OS and the reason
for that is that they had to specially
design the software in order to flow
like water from one orientation to
another so you can use it like this in
tablet mode so that's either portrait or
landscape mode that is a four by three
display if you're into the mobile
productivity you can fold it up and use
it like this and you're gonna end up
with a sixteen by nine display you can
turn it around and here you've got I
believe it's an 18 by nine display if
you use it in this aspect ratio and
what's cool is that you can either turn
off the rear display and what they call
mid brightness mode I think medium
brightness mode or you can keep it
enabled just for that like you know
super casual hey you know no big deal
but this is just the future in my hand
passing you know don't stress out about
it's all good they've also got an edge
display as you can clearly see here man
that looks so cool and there's a bunch
of functionality that you can set up in
order to click on it there we go
so I customized mine to have a camera
icon there the camera is also pretty
crazy so there's two cameras they're
both right there which means if you want
to take a selfie you go ahead and hit
that selfie button boom switch the
secondary screen it uses it seems to use
accelerometers and gyroscopes or
whatever like traditional orientation
mechanisms in order to tell which screen
you're looking at so sometimes it's a
little bit off but there you go I'm in
selfie mode or boom you want to switch
back you go like there's still a little
bit of placeholder Chinese in the OS
look they're not planning to launch this
in the US like anytime soon like
hopefully sometime this year they said
but they're already actually launched in
China and then this is pretty cool you
can go into whoops there we go dual mode
and then both the user and
subject can actually see like preview
the picture that you're taking I know
right however there are definitely some
things I noticed while content
consumption is actually I would consider
to be a strong point for a design like
this where you've got stereo speakers
I'm gonna go like that stereo speakers
if you're in tablet mode or you're gonna
have to switch to while effectively I
mean they could still be pumping stereo
sound but you'd only really get a mono
effect out of them speakers in folded
mode the screen is a bit of a weak point
so one of the first things I noticed
about it when I walked up was that on
the lock screen you can clearly see what
appear to be some kinds of like
striations through the display and now
initially what I thought was that this
was because of the fold here either the
screen had been worn out by being folded
and unfolded a thousand times on the
show floor or it was the slightly ribbed
texture behind it that was causing it to
appear that way upon further inspection
though what I realized was that they're
present everywhere so you can see under
this file management a clock icon
there's kind of a shadow that even moves
around as I swiped the icons to the left
and right now then I thought maybe this
is some kind of a shadow that they've
baked into their OS as a graphical
feature then though I switched it here
and it appears as though they still run
this way so there was something else
what was the other thing that I was yeah
I was using the Play Store as an example
here so you can see those shadows are
still down here so it appears to be an
artifact of the display technology
itself at least at this time another
thing that was quite noticeable to me
was if we fire up the messaging app
we've actually got I mean I guess this
is great for a show floor demo because
you've kind of got a watermark on every
screen but they clearly had demo video
running on this for
sometime and we all know that burnin can
be an issue with AMOLED technology and
it appears that the the state that
they're in right now is one we're burnin
is not just possible but even present on
these show floor devices so state of
things now this is really cool
especially how impressively tight
they've got the bend on this thing and
now that I'm aware that the issue with
the striations through the display is
not actually the panel or is not
actually the the Bend mechanism itself
that's sick
now there's still obviously some work to
do on the software side and there's
definitely work to do on the panel side
making sure that it's not burning in
like that and improving their color
accuracy right I forgot one more thing
so comparing the Play Store icon and
Amazon icon remember these are known I
con with my samsung note 9 in just the
basic mode and whatever the other one is
without the the blue light filter on or
anything you can see that there's not
much color depth to the display so the
subtleties of colors can get lost a
little bit that's why that YouTube play
button there is like a shrieking vibrant
red rather than the more subtle red that
it would naturally be so still some work
to do on the panel tech but very cool
direction and I could definitely get
used to the idea of having something
that I can fold up put in my pocket
check that out and then unfold and boom
I'm watching fullscreen content just
like that what an incredible experience
for the future
speaking of the future if you care about
the future your phone you probably want
to get a deep brand grip and a prism
screen protector the deep brand grip is
impact resistant it's got these little
lips on the front so even if you put it
down on a table or whatever you're not
going to scratch your screen
it's got precision cutouts for your
camera your touch sensor all that good
stuff and they're super clicky buttons
of course you can customize it with the
skin of your choice and their prism
screen protector is basically
unbelievable
it comes with an applicator so you can
put it on perfectly every time and this
demo is real I'm actually hammering a
nail into a piece of wood with the front
of a screen
you take the screen protector off boom
screen still good I'm not recommending
you do it I'm just saying you could if
you really really really wanted to so
