sometimes a new product isn't really all
that new this kind of thing has happened
before and the funny thing is it's not
like people don't notice just look at
AMD with their pet care and family of
GPUs back in 2012 through 2015
that was three whole generations of
basically the same card under different
names and it's not just AMD that pulls
this rebranding and rebadging BS all the
big players do it
nvidia intel you name it so why does it
keep happening and why is AMD releasing
a GPU for the third time again I think
we have got the answer
origin PC builds custom desktops and
high-performance laptops with free
lifetime 24/7 tech support and they only
use high-end components like Samsung's
970 Evo Pro m2 SSD visit Origin PC today
at the link below for a special promo
ok so it's not like every product you
buy is a straight re-release sometimes
we get a high end product in one
generation rebadged as a mid tier one in
the next like the geforce gtx 680 being
rebranded as the gtx 770 with a mild
clock speed bump and we also usually see
a token price reduction to go along with
that honestly no problem with that it's
a good way to get rid of old stock and
it's good value for the consumer win-win
on the other hand when a product gets
positioned the same way that it was
during the previous generation a lot of
negative press almost always comes along
with it one need only look at last
week's kora 999 ATX II which Intel build
as two generations higher than the 79 80
XE that it replaced even though all they
did was tune their existing chip so then
if that's the case why does anybody do
this I mean it's not free to launch a
product it's actually more expensive
than you'd probably think you have to
pay for advertising with partner
websites you've got to cede units to
OEMs for validation you've got to jump
through all the regulatory hoops
involved in getting FCC certification
and the like you've got to get new UPC
ABN codes and if you've pushed clock
speeds higher you might even need to
design and manufacture a new cooler
furthermore if you set aside I don't
know let's be conservative and say 50
cards to go out to just the popular
reviewers at a cost of $200 a pop that
works out to $10,000 all on its own but
believe it or not that last point is
actually where the advantages of
rebranding shine through now very few
media outlets re-review the same product
that they already reviewed so new
software driver features and performance
improvements can end up buried under the
wave of initial launch reviews so by
making that product new again will you
create an incentive to cover it again I
mean we're not the only ones who are
eager to cover new releases because our
followers want to know about them this
drives traffic for the media outlets
channel or
and for that new product so a hot
product release can easily generate
millions of views which if we compare to
advertising with a more traditional
campaign lasting for a review cycle
yields a savings of several times the
cost so you could have millions of
engaged eyeballs that are hyper
interested in the product at half the
cost of just a million nett it's an ad
eyeballs seems like a no-brainer
of course developing a derivative
product of something that you already
know works is appealing to the bean
counters and the investors as well
because it involves less risk well at
the R&amp;amp;D budget is approximately three
billion and this is the first one so
that if anyone would like to buy this
it's three billion dollars I'm pretty
sure that that's no lie there's a lot of
R&amp;amp;D tooling and financial dice rolling
that makes any brand new products a
really risky and therefore potentially
costly endeavor I mean just ask Intel
how their ten nanometer processors are
coming along you might not even get a
product out of it now as consumers we've
kind of just taken for granted that new
processes just keep happening because
even without Moore's Law Apple and
Qualcomm have continued to improve
generationally and then more to the
point tweaking an existing design can
result in not only better clock speeds
but also better yields which further
lowers cost as long as the performance
is still good enough so that's another
reason that it might be ideal to release
something even when it wouldn't be
financially viable to Rd an all-new chip
or if whatever's in the pipeline is way
behind schedule
so the rx 590 seems to fit that
description since this is our third time
seeing this GPU and the clocks are a
little bit higher than before so this
kind of generational tweaking actually
worked out great with amd's second
generation rise in CPUs but while
reisen's refresh had AMD coming into it
from a position of relative strength
polaris refresh again appears to be
simply
AMD's hand being forced because they
know that invidious incoming mid-range
GPU demands some kind of answer on the
subject of nvidia more reasons for this
whole behavior nvidia has a method of
dominating news cycles in a way that AMD
mercifully generally doesn't so do you
remember how it took a while after the
launch of their r-tx cards for anyone to
have envy link sli numbers i've actually
had experience with nvidia going out of
their way to make it difficult for
reviewers to get multiple cards in time
for launch sli coverage that way they
get a new cycle for the announcement a
new cycle for the unveil a new cycle for
the pre-order a new cycle for their
ridiculous unboxing embargo another for
the performance review another for sli
and then finally another one when our TX
games actually finally show up so here's
the thing why are we so mad about this
well there's the element of time wasting
I mean we all I mean the press in
general reviewed the 79-80 XE and then
we did it again when they called it
something new this makes our lives more
boring we'd rather cover stuff that's
actually new but the more offensive
thing about this practice of not naming
products properly is that it confuses
the customer and it gets worse we
haven't even really touched on the
practice of introducing cut-down
products that reuse an existing products
name both Nvidia and AMD have engaged in
this utterly deplorable practice in the
last couple of product generations with
the GTX 1063 gig which does not have the
same grade of GPU as the six gig variant
but just with half the RAM and AMD's
more recent rx 580 2048 SP which isn't
an rx 580 it's more like a clock boosted
rx 570 so you might think well just
don't sweat it Linus recycle your old
numbers and call it a day but the issue
is that we can't do that because a it
would be wrong and be it's not always
that simple so on our reviewers guide
for the rx 590 for example it said in
big bold letters
AMD move to 12
FinFET which sounds lower than 40
nanometers efficiency improvements maybe
no so just like Intel refusing to
provide a proper spec sheet that
clarifies that their top-tier chip
throttles below its base clock in
avx-512 workloads in fact to the same
level as the predecessor AMD has put it
on reviewers to dig up that that 12
nanometer they're boasting about it's
just Global Foundries variation of
Samsung's 14 nanometer
there's no transistor shrink so it's
just the same die area for the same
compute course but with higher clock
stability and that would be fine if they
weren't trying to pass it off as a new
graphics card it's suggested retail
price of 280 bucks is pretty far out
there when a gig rx5 ATS can be seen for
sixty to eighty dollars less many
because their OC models with core clocks
within a hundred and fifty megahertz or
so so I guess here's what we're saying
some advice free of charge if you got
nothing and all you want is some fresh
coverage of your product be honest call
it an Rx 580 plus or rx 480 plus plus
since we're on the subject and spend
that launch budget on something else
like I get the appeal of using a
relaunch to reset your MSRP that was
eroded by gradually lower sales and
promotions but I would make the argument
that the only people that you're fooling
with this new product at a higher price
are really being taken advantage of now
one thing AMD is doing right here is
expanding the value proposition with a
game bundle for buying an RX 590 but I'm
not sure if Resident Evil 2 HD the
division 2 and Devil May Cry 5 is
exactly a blockbuster lineup so this is
the bottom line after the core I know 99
8 exe Fiasco we just want to ask that
manufacturers be more transparent about
how they position and especially how
they price these derivative products not
only can proper positioning lead to
better sales and sentiment it also leads
to a happier PC gaming community oh and
by the way if anyone wanted to know
how the rx 590 performs it's fine yeah
it's a bit faster than the arts 580
which is about what you'd expect zoom is
