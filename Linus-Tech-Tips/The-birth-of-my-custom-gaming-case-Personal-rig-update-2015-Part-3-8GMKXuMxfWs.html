of guy so in my perfect world I'd be
showing you guys the coolest parts at
the end of the video like the laser
cutter but I want this video to be sort
of a start-to-finish
journey of the of the birth of the new
case for my personal rig so we're going
to go completely in order all the way
through the bending and and the and the
cutting until we arrive here
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster check out
the link in the video description to try
it for free alright so this machine
you're looking at right now is a 2.5
kilowatt yes that is 2,500 watts carbon
dioxide laser worth about a million
Canadian rupees it concentrates all of
that power on a spot about seven one
thousandth of an inch in diameter giving
it an energy density greater than the
Sun and allowing it to vaporize up to
200 inches per minute of 20 gauge cold
rolled steel as you watch the laser
start a new cut you'll see an initial
flash where the plasma goes flying up as
the beam hits the top of the metal then
you'll see sparks on the bottom from the
inert assist gas protocol e makes their
own on-site with a nitrogen generator
blowing it down towards the grate which
holds the metal in place during the
cutting process so the machine you're
looking at right now is purely digitally
controlled and has been running about 18
hours a day since 2008 with only about 5
days of downtime the next stage is
deburring for small parts that would
otherwise fall through the grate and get
lost in the cutter there's little tabs
to hold them in place that need to be
manually removed but all of the parts do
actually get Deibert anyway because
while in a perfect world little bits of
melted metal would not cling to the
finished parts because the laser has to
slow down going into the corners of a
cut power needs to be dropped
appropriately or the size of the cut
will change and co2 lasers don't respond
as fast as the machine needs to move so
power control on the corners is
imperfect so for that reason two sets of
rotary brushes are used first a high
abrasion one to eliminate what they call
dragon's teeth and slag with a less
aggressive one to round the extremely
sharp corners that would otherwise slice
up your hands
fun fact the two sets of brushes that
are used oscillate back and forth by at
least one brush radius this ensures that
every edge is hit equally from all sides
and gives the bare-metal a uniform
finish for applications where it won't
be painted next is countersinking where
our very small project was run on a
drill press with a spring-loaded depth
stop device to ensure that all the
screws are perfectly flush but for
larger projects there's actually a CNC
router table that does this
automatically next is the part where we
all do the bender bender ah dude oh I
fell off my box
anyway um anyway no actually this is the
part where the metal gets bent proto
case performs their bends on a press
break with a punch and die system that's
designed for airbending where the punch
the ground hardened steel piece beds is
made to be accurate to put them about a
couple thousandths of an inch
pushes the metal down into the die but
leaves an air gap under it
this technique combined with the
accuracy of the controls being used so
the one you're looking at is a CNC
controlled 60 ton press and extensive
computer simulation of metal bending to
compensate for spring back and metals
propensity to stretch better than it
compresses allows air bending to be very
versatile and accurate without the same
operator skill requirement as bottom
bending where the punch bottoms out into
the bottom of the die at the next stage
pens or cell flinching fasteners if
you're one of those people that actually
calls things self-adhesive bandage or
facial tissue instead of band-aid or
Kleenex and these are standoff stands
and nuts that are inserted by a press
that applies six tons of force to
permanently fasten them to the metal fun
fact the press doesn't apply its force
until it's about a fingernails width
from the workpiece to prevent operators
from crushing their fingers when it
comes to welding there is no single way
to do it but proto case uses gear from
an Australian company called fro Gnaeus
that helps to alleviate some of the
shoes with using more traditional MIG
and TIG welding techniques like the
tendency for example of thin sheet metal
to get wavy or even melt back from the
attempt to join leaving two ugly pieces
of metal and a gap in between instead of
a joint it actually bears a lot of
similarity to MIG welding where a spool
of wire is being constantly fed towards
the joint filling much the same role as
solder wood and soldering except that
the difference with fergus's technique
is that thanks to digital control of
power and the spool feed rate the filler
metal is actually repeatedly heated and
applied 20 to 30 times per second rather
than constantly this results in cleaner
work lower power consumption and less
heat being applied to the workpiece so
with this tech instead of being limited
to working with 16 gauge aluminum or
higher you can go all the way down to
about the thickness of a pop can the
only drawback is that machines from
erroneous cost about ten times there's
always the gotcha isn't there router
milling is used in situations where the
design work is too fine to handle the
heat of a laser so the setup you're
looking at is a five by 10 foot table
with a CNC controlled cutter very
similar to a drill bit that can be
controlled to within about a thousandth
of an inch the coolest thing about this
doodad is the automatic tool changer so
more of the process is automated even if
asked to make a lot of different kinds
of cuts then with all the parts bent and
cut it is finally time for painting
almost working mistake number one with
any paint job is poor preparation so the
entire project gets cleaned and
degreased
edged with a phosphate to roughen the
surface for better adhesion and in the
case of steel coated with a light touch
of zirconium for corrosion resistance
after that all the little screw threads
and anything else that would be damaged
or resized out of Tolerance by getting
gunked up with paint gets plugged
heat-resistant masking tape is used for
any areas that need to stay barrel and
then the finished parts are hung up
electrically conductive hooks where the
powder coating powder clings to them due
to static electricity yet another fun
fact the nozzle of the powder coat
applicator is charged at 100,000 volts
to make the powder really cling to the
parts so you can actually build up
multiple layers of material before
they're finally rolled into an oven and
baked which leads us to the final stage
assembly where the computer drawings are
turned into a real-life object that if
all goes according to plan somewhat
corresponds to the original computer
drawing and from first inspection I'd
say this went pretty darn well I can't
wait to put my liquid cooled system into
this truly one-of-a-kind rackmount case
so huge thanks to proto case for
building it for me it is really amazing
what those guys can do with custom metal
fabrication speaking of amazing what if
there was a desk that could be lower and
then higher oh there is write-up desk
comm the providers of the desks that we
use here in our editing den benchmarking
room and in my office they're fantastic
because not only do they allow any
individual user to get it customized to
exactly the right height for their their
best comfort while they're working they
are also quickly and easily adjustable
so you can go okay I want to be sitting
right now oh you know what I'd rather
kind of stretch out my back a little bit
and step work standing up for a little
while
no problem we've got presets all you do
is hold the button and boom it goes to
exactly the setting that you set with
the preset we've got a variety of
different table tops everything from
corner desks two large straight desks
two smaller straight desks they've got a
lot of different surface coverings that
they can do and a little bird told me
that if you contact them directly they
can even work on custom sizes of
tabletops as well so check it out over
at updesk dot-com slash Lynas linked in
the video description if you've been
thinking to yourself gee I sure would
like a standing desk one that's
well-built high-quality and all that
good stuff
