only complaint about Ben Q's 2420 TX
which if you guys do or don't recall
I'll tell you either way is the 3d
monitor that we use for all of our 3d
vision testing because unlike most other
3d monitors that I've ever tried I don't
get a headache using the 24 22 X because
it's all about pixel response times when
it comes to a smooth 3d experience I
mean with that said no LCD is perfect
and something like a DLP projector or
you know hopefully at some point in the
future like an O LED display I really
wish sed had taken off anyway the point
is the 24 20 T X is the monitor we use
for our 3d testing because it's awesome
and my only complaint about it was that
it's 24-inch
as opposed to 27-inch which Ben Q's
competitor a soos has had on the market
for quite a while so in the top we find
a stand I realize I should have been
showing this to you as we run but
somewhat of an unboxing if I don't even
show you what I'm looking at here's
their little control module so you can
control the on-screen display with a
little wheel and a click in the back and
a 1 2 3 4 profiles and things like that
there's also a dust cover we'll show you
that later as well as some cables you
know what I give up I'm not even going
to bother showing you guys that ok
moving right along we've got oh yeah see
you always know a monitor is like better
when it comes in more pieces trust me on
this you guys if a monitor comes in one
piece it's because it's like super low
profile which means it probably has no
height adjust it probably has like no
noble or anything like that it's
probably a super basic monitor so this
packing material up here it's kind of
scary for unboxers because at some point
everything you unbox has to be reboxed
and look at all these compartments nice
thick foam though overall so I'm not too
worried about the product being damaged
in any way even though it is a bit of a
bit of a weaker style of foam and it can
only take one serious impact unlike a
softer closed cell foam the good news
about it though is that this was shipped
just in this box alone and nothing
inside even the foam itself
was damaged so here's the LCD panel
itself which has about an inch of foam
around the outside edges here you can
see there's less than an inch here but
there's a gap there so it's it's fine
it's not actually the monitor up against
the edge of the box and then it sits
face down in this guy right here 27-inch
monitors
some people find that the dot pitch of a
1080p monitor at 27-inch is a little bit
a little bit low that is to say that the
pixel density isn't quite high enough it
depends how close you sit to it
personally I love large format high
resolution monitors but many people also
don't mind it and even find it more
enjoyable because what it does and this
is just it's kind of an indirect side
effect is it makes text larger makes
everything generally larger so
particularly if you don't see well a
larger monitor with not necessarily a
super-high resolution can be a very good
choice alright so the default picture
mode on this monitor is FPS which is
designed for FPS games if you do not
intend to play FPS games press any of
the control keys on the right of the
monitor and select picture mode to
change the setting okay so go ahead and
pull that off this is the official
monitor of the intel extreme masters
gaming tournament which is kind of cool
so I'm sure some kind of validation was
done somewhere along the line that it's
that it's good mind you if it's anything
like the 24 20 T r-tx which are
basically the same monitor one with a
transmitter one with not then it should
be pretty good and we're going to go
ahead and assemble it and then we'll be
back in a moment
assembly is pretty straightforward align
the arrow on the bottom of the stand to
the arrow on the base right there well
you can try to do that simple as long as
you're not me there you go
rotate it to put it in place then twist
in the screw on the bottom either with
your hands or with a Philips head
screwdriver
no video would be complete without one
of my classic phone size comparison so
this is the HTC One it's not a
particularly slim monitor however the
electronics that go into these
high-speed displays necessitate a little
bit of a thicker form factor with more
ventilation so you can see there's
actually ventilation holes all along the
back here that are covered in a plastic
until you remove them there we go go
ahead and do that and then
we can mount it to the stand which is as
simple as aligning it correctly which is
easier to do when you're on the other
side okay apparently it's really easy to
do because I got it just aligning it and
then letting it pop into place you can
then remove the monitor by pressing this
button and picking it up just like that
once it's all assembled you have a lot
of different options in terms of
adjustments so you have height adjust
there you go
now let's go that's about six inches of
height adjust you've got tilt just like
that and you've got swivel no pivot on
this one pivot remember guys is when you
can change it okay it does have pivot
never mind okay so it has pretty much
the entire range of adjustments although
I really can't imagine anyone actually
gaming like this but but one thing that
I do use the pivot on my monitor for is
plugging in my connectors and then
putting it back so there you go it might
be handy for you included accessories
wise things are pretty straightforward
here's that dust cover that I showed you
guys before so if you're worried about
dust on your monitor then you can use it
there you go we're just going to take
that off for now though let's talk a
little bit about the feature so it's a
120 Hertz monitor which is required for
3d it is also better for not 3d
particularly if you're worried about the
maximum responsiveness remember any 60
Hertz monitor no matter how little lag
there is in the rest of your gaming
setup whether it's your mouse or whether
it's your graphics card or any other
delay in something happening to reaching
your eyes on the screen a 60 Hertz
monitor at best can do sixteen point six
milliseconds assuming it's perfect of
sort of bet of worst case scenario
latency to getting the image to your
eyes a 120 Hertz monitor cuts that in
half it will bring you more images so
that the worst case scenario for an
update will be not as bad by half so
there you go that was a very convoluted
explanation but I hope you understand
display modes can be changed to 17 19 19
y 21 and a half Y 22 Y 23 wide 23.6 wide
and 24 wide this is handy because what
it allows you to do is practice at a
different aspect ratio or a different
monitor size before sort of walking in
blind to a tournament setting where
you're required to use a different
monitor smart scaling for fine-tuned
picture sizes that's basically the same
thing as display mode and they're black
equalizer for optimum visit
we'll pull details out of blacks rather
than crushing them so what it does do is
it makes the blacks a little bit less
deep a little bit less true but you're
compromising that for the sake of being
able to see someone crouching in a
shadow or being able to see a unit in an
RTS that's kind of hidden in the fog of
war or whatever else are outside of your
visibility or something like that so
you're able to see details that you
couldn't otherwise then Keys rating it
at a 1 millisecond grade of gray
response time and it does support light
boost which is 3d vision to sort of
we're going to be back in a moment
because our lighting just dramatically
changed more handy features it comes
with a handle as well as a headphone
hook which I personally think is kind of
cool it's nice to have somewhere to keep
your headphones as well as a built-in
USB hub hub so there's your headphone
output on the side of the monitor as
well as 2 USB port so you could actually
plug all of your peripherals into the
side of the monitor down here we find
all of the i/o so it's support there's
more USB hubs so there's your USB in
which is going to give you 3 USBs out
between the one on the bottom and the
two on the side dual HDMI in which is
cool because if you're a console gamer
and you don't have like maybe you're in
a dorm or something like that you don't
have you know a monitor and a TV and
like another TV then you can just switch
the inputs and you can go okay Xbox
input PC input and switch between them
just like that so dual HDMI dual link
DVI this is important because this one
is going to be the one that's going to
run Nvidia 3d vision you have to have
120 Hertz support and HDMI at 1920 by
1080 does not support it it's not fast
enough VGA seriously if you're using a
monitor like this with VGA that's a
problem there's the last USB output
which goes to that little controller
which actually clips to the side of the
monitor on whichever side you prefer
using a little magnet so you can put it
right there and then run this up to that
output and last but not least it
supports DisplayPort in there's your
power in right there and included cables
are dual link DVI use this one power VGA
and USB a 2b which is what will power
and provide data for the built-in hub
last but not least touch sensitive
controls but not the bad
kind of touch sensitive controls these
ones have audio audible feedback so you
press them they go beep and then they
also light up which is really really
cool and the menu pops up right here I
actually found using these more
convenient than using this one but
that's just me also it looks like this
monitor does have a built in 3d emitter
much like the 2420 TX as opposed to the
24 20 T which means you don't have to
have the little pyramid shaped 3d vision
emitter I thought maybe I had one handy
but it looks like I don't don't forget
