a novelty item but to those people I
would say this look at the root of the
word novelty it's novel which to me says
you're just being closed-minded because
it's in the shape of a book that is to
say judging a book by it's cover that
was a joke but this video is actually
very serious
this is an unusual product for us but I
got a special request to do a video
about it and I was intrigued so I
figured what the hey let's try something
a little different the jazz mini is a
beautiful and compact aluminum stand for
your smartphone that even holds tablets
up to eight inches click now to learn
more in our journey to determine what
exactly loomio is we'll start with their
website
hello loomio comm seems to suggest that
in fact loomio is something much more
than just a lamp with words like
simplicity possibility and beauty well I
don't know anything about that stuff but
what I do know is that loomio is an LED
lamp in the shape of a book it features
an environmentally conscious
construction that is recyclable although
it doesn't allow the integrated battery
rated at about 8 hours to be replaced
and you can choose from three different
finishes cherry maple or walnut also the
pages are made of water-resistant Tyvek
the way it works is and I have to admit
it's actually about as captivating as
most of the pictures in their gallery
suggest you simply open up what looks
like a fairly ordinary hardcover book
and an internal switch automatically
turns the lamp on and reveals a
surprisingly powerful light source
brightness control is strictly analog
that is to say you control it by opening
up the book more or less the spine is
made of wood like the rest of the cover
which gives it strength and mounting
flexibility so you can open it up on a
flat surface prop it up like a book open
it up fully and pin it there with the
neodymium magnets embedded in the cover
and the included magnetic widget or put
the included leather strap on the widget
and hang it for a completely different
effect there are some other creative
ideas that were included with the
Kickstarter launch video such as
sticking it to a metal surface such as a
shelf when you're trying to get
something from inside a closet but
honestly unless
I was planning for a place to put my
loomio like if I were to run out and
specifically buy a metal shelf or a
small table to put next to my reading
chair that has a metal surface I just
didn't find many places that I could
stick it that would make a ton of sense
I mean the fridge perhaps if the light
included with my fridge was already
broken perhaps and therein lies the
problem
a big part of the pitch for loomio is
convenience pull it out when you can't
find something in the dark pull it out
when you need to read a book under a
kitchen cabinet instead of three feet to
the right where the lighting appears to
be perfectly adequate or and this one
really made my eyes just about roll out
of my skull onto the floor pull it out
an emergency situation what defines a
convenient solution in my eyes is
something that's easier and/or faster
than the other way to achieve an
objective and given the popularity of
smartphones with integrated flashes
you're more likely to have one of those
handy than a loomio in any of the above
scenarios so in short I think those
things are loomio trying to be something
it's not it's not really any more
convenient than a flashlight and if
those were better than other solutions
I'm sure we'd light our houses with them
and carry them around too but we don't
and besides for a hundred and sixty
dollars I can get a pretty cool
flashlight and a book to like pointed at
instead if I'm looking at this from a
purely pragmatic perspective so we need
to detach from practicality a little bit
to correctly evaluate what ludmil isn't
and what it is what it isn't is
something I'm going to start carrying
around with me all the time it's just
not useful often enough to justify the
extra pound of weight and the stress of
you know worrying about accidentally
damaging its pages with the other junk
in my bag so it falls into the same
category as tablets for me neato when
I'm at home and it's nearby but really
too bulky to make part of my everyday
life what it also isn't is a light
fixture it's 500 lumen rating puts it in
the neighborhood of a 40 watt bulb which
is an impressive feat for something so
slim and battery powered and honestly it
works well and looks awesome to the
point where I'm sure folks would
consider putting you know metal plates
on a wall to accommodate it but the
issue
is that the design doesn't allow it to
hook up to your house wiring in any way
that would be practical and I'm not
going to build permanent fixtures in my
house around a light that needs to be
charged somewhere else every time before
it can be relocated and then used what
ludmil is to me though is a really cool
fashion statement that has the added
benefit of actually coming in handy from
time to time I mean say what you will
about how expensive it is lighting
products are expensive in general so
it's not totally out to lunch there but
if you pull one of these out and put it
on the table for a romantic dinner or
bring it out to impress some friends
when you sit down to drink some wine and
play a game of Settlers of Catan or
something it's a fantastic conversation
starter and I've seen people spend a lot
more than 160 dollars on stuff that's
legitimately useless and with loomio it
was kind of cool to use my latest gadget
to play superhero when my wife was cross
stitching in bed and needed a bit of
extra light i stood up walked over to
the bed and whipped it out for the
loomio that is and she was like oh cool
that's perfect and propped it up on the
headboard so she could see what she was
doing
not exactly earth-shattering and not the
kind of thing that I typically spend
that kind of money on but certainly
better than useless thanks for watching
