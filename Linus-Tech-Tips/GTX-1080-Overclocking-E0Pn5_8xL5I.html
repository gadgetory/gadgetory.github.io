many tech enthusiasts to spend just a
lot more on their rig this time however
I'll be talking about overclocking
something specific a GTX 1080 spoiler
aleut aleut spoiler alert it overclocks
quite well but there's a wild card here
Nvidia introduced GPU boost 3.0 and it's
a whole new beast
kula masters master case maker five
features the freeform modular system for
nearly unlimited customization learn
more in the link in the video
description to explain GPU boost 3 we
need to give some information about GPU
boost to your graphics card wood
dynamically change its frequency across
a linear frequency offset curve this is
the curve that you would increase across
the board due to it being linear
whenever you applied an overclock of say
50 or 100 or whatever it was on that
little slider that you had before and
then based on the load that's on your
card your frequency would fluctuate
along that curve this is generally quite
a good system but it sometimes falls
short because it doesn't crank your
clock speeds up to its potential maximum
for every single possible voltage level
and these voltage levels will
dynamically change based on things like
temperature power and a whole bunch of
other stuff so odds are you're losing
performance somewhere so GPU boost 3
alongside other more general
improvements over GPU boost 2 allows us
to either overclock the old way with
linear offset curves or break away from
that linear offset curve and tune things
per voltage point what ok so that's kind
of rather confusing sorry about that
let's actually do some stuff and
hopefully it will make more sense the
feature that helps you do these things
is called OC scanner within the EVGA
precision app which is the only ones
that supports it so far although I'm
sure it will become ubiquitous soon
within the scanner there are three
different modes basic mode applies a set
frequency offset to all voltage points
linear mode allows users to linearly
increase the clock offset after choosing
a start and end point and then it gets
interesting with manual mode which first
off it's fairly self-explanatory you
manually input values for frequency at
each voltage step but it also enables
the run button which is where the fun
begins
this will run an automatic test that
will determine and apply what it thinks
is an optimal overclock but before
clicking run click the little cog wheel
down below which is enabled in the OC
scanner mode and play with the settings
a bit they start a little too high in my
opinion although this may change but
the time people get their hands on it I
set my test period to five seconds my
starting kilohertz offset to two hundred
thousand my end to 250 thousand and my
step to ten thousand then I went back to
the main screen and increased my power
target and temperature target to one
hundred and twenty percent and ninety
two degrees then it's time to click run
what happens now is a fur mark window
will open and a fuzzy EVGA logo will
show up resulting in what Colton called
mspaint with radar what a noob anyways
this will stress out the graphics card
and check at a specific amount of
voltage how much frequency the card can
pump out by increasing said frequency
over the start amount by the step count
that we set earlier in that cogwheel and
retesting over and over and over again
hopefully recovering from crashes mostly
on its own now there are more features
coming like aggression percentage and
stuff like that so you can have more
conservative but stable overclocks
but the performance increase over non
overclocked is already pretty good
considering this was an entirely
automated process after that I set
everything back to default and applied a
manual overclock of my own increasing
the core clock by 200 megahertz and the
memory clock by 500 megahertz this isn't
the most aggressive overclock I could
have done but it was pretty rock-solid
and I'm comfortable running both my 10
80s at this speed so if you do it on
your own should probably be fine now my
overclock of beat the new OSI scanner
automated overclocked but as automation
isn't really the point I went back to
the OSI scanner found the result that it
gave me and played around a bit by
increasing a few of the different
frequency steps along the way mainly the
ones near the top end this actually
helped me defeat my manual overclock
I'll be it by a fairly minor amount
quickly and very easily
now that was actually pretty cool but at
the same time the limit of the OSI
scanner kept on hitting so that it would
stop was usually a power limit so while
I'm happy with the result we got now I'm
even more excited for the results we may
get from future cards like aftermarket
solutions with more power availability
I'm shooting this video before I leave
for Computex and I'm pretty sure that's
coming out
after I come back so by the time you see
this you will actually be more informed
than I currently am about what cards
will be available with potentially
higher power solutions so here's hoping
that that actually does happen does it
give you the creeps when your internet
provider tracks your web browsing
today's lack of online privacy brings
out your inner grizzly bear then you
should try bear tunnel bear is a simple
VPN app that makes it easy to browse
privately and enjoy a more open Internet
what tunnel bear turned on your Wi-Fi
connection is secured and your online
activity is kept private from your
internet provider and people like
advertisers that are trying to look up
and track people so they can target
advertisements on you and sell that
information to other people what you
don't necessarily want and the profit
from that data sale tunnel bear has a
top rated privacy policy and does not
log your activity try for free with 500
megabytes and no credit card required
and if you choose to get unlimited data
you can save 10% by going to tunnel bear

it if you dislike the video and you're
like i don't want to perform as toon
McGrath's card you're dumb you can do
that and also subscribe if you want to
see more of our coverage on aftermarket
entity cards and everything else to be
completely honest go to Amazon use our

actually kind of a big deal and stuff
you can buy our t-shirts at Lane come in
video description down below go on the
forum and talk about graphics cards in a
constructive and non aggro way and check
out this video up here which was the
release video for our 1080 that will
give you more information about just
like kind of the reference card and how
it performs when it's not overclocked</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
