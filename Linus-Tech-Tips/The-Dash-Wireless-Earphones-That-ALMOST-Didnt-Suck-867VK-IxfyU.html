Linus backed way back in holy crap March
2014 with an estimated delivery date of
January 2015
alrighty then
well at least they delivered something
which is more than a lot of
Kickstarter's ever do this finally is
the - from braggy which raised over
three million dollars on the promise of
being the world's first truly Wireless
in-ear headphones let's see how they did
shall we

I give braggy full marks for packaging
and presentation but companies that
create successful Kickstarter campaigns
are usually good at that stuff even if
they suck at everything else the dash
comes in an attractive box that opens up
to reveal a charming booklet style Quick
Start Guide that's built right into it
then small compartments containing the
small medium and large fit sleeves the
extra small is pre-installed the
magnetic charger cradle with the
earphones pre-installed in it a sliding
aluminum cover that fit very snugly over
the charger with a clever slit to peek
at the charge indicator lights on the
earphones that can be activated by
shaking them and finally a clip to keep
from losing your earphones along with a
USB cable cool and it gets cooler
actually when you put them in your ear
they start automagically talking to you
hi I'm the - explaining that the right
side is for communication in music while
the left is for activity tracking then
they tell you to hold the right side
until you hear the pairing sound which I
never heard but when I fired up my
iPhone it showed up in the listing
connected in a couple of seconds making
it a very cool and seamless experience
out of the box and the goodness
continues their Android app is well
rated at over 4 stars with 5,000
downloads but it's the iOS one that I
ended up using which was good as well
when you open it up there's a slick
animation for how to insert the
earphones correctly and instructions for
connecting the app to the dash by
holding the left ear phone for a few
seconds one frustrating thing is you
have to avoid using the earphones with
any other apps in order to get the full
functionality of the braggy app so you
can't make changes on the fly while
you're listening to music then you have
to eject them from the braggy app once
you're finished configuring not knowing
this caused a glitch or a couple of
times where even after ejecting I could
control music playback supposedly but I
actually here anything without
refreshing the earphones by putting them
into the charging cable weird anyway
from inside the app you can select
running cycling and swimming for the
activity tracker you can also do it
through the touch sensitive interface on
the Left earbud by the way but activity
tracker stuff isn't really my thing so
that won't be a big focus for this video
it is sick however that the earphones
are waterproof to one meter
something I actually didn't know until
they arrived and I read it on the box
though in my defense I did back this
thing like two years ago of course being
able to wear them while running or
swimming would count for nothing if they
didn't stay in and stay comfortable and
I've got to give braggy a lot of points
here I was fully expecting the dash to
be unreasonably heavy and uncomfortable
due to their completely self-contained
design battery drivers touch interface
motion sensor microphones it's all in
there and they managed to make them fit
well enough and be light enough that any
of these activities were no problem for
me in spite of my extra small size ear
canals great job guys
there are a couple of more app things I
should cover before moving on there are
gestures right now nodding and shaking
your head to accept or reject a call
neither of which worked in my testing
but your mileage may vary with more
gestures to come and each ear phone has
a regrettably non configurable but
surprising range of functions that you
can access by tapping double tapping
swiping holding and long holding
including a transparency mode that
sounds cool in theory allowing the
Dash's microphone to pass surrounding
sounds through to you with the speakers
so you can hear them better but in
practice makes very little difference
since the microphone is not that
sensitive to ambient noise and the
earphones passive noise isolation is not
a strong point of the product in the
first place with or without music I
could hardly tell the difference between
the two modes Calibos the - Enzo Java
microphone for phone calls isn't
supposed to
ambient noise let you judge for yourself
well that works you know the audio
recording just wasn't a weather
courtroom when you're listening to now
call to Brenda's iPhone for comparison
sake you've got a few other microphones
what you're listening to right now is
being recorded on the iPhone 6s built-in
mic what you're listening to now is
being recorded on the j-bird Levi's ex
also a wireless earphone well not
actively completely Wireless I guess and
this finally is being recorded on the
horse party microphone cable that's
available for the sennheiser idat
headphones that I use as my daily
drivers battery life was frankly nothing
impressive at around a few hours per
charge at best and I suspect most people
will find themselves carrying around the
charging case but there's good news here
another thing I forgot the case has its
own battery that charges up the
earphones a few times so you only have
to plug it in via microUSB once per day
all right Linus you tease when are you
going to get to the meat and potatoes of
this how do they sound there okay
actually better than okay surprisingly
okay
well-rounded pleasing sound signature
with solid not overpowering bass and
reasonable clarity in the highs okay I
mean no they are not comparable to a
similarly priced wired IEM like my daily
driver ie 80s they have a shockingly
high noise floor they don't get very
loud and they're just plain not as good
but considering all the additional
functionality I'd have given sound
quality a great score if the Bluetooth
connectivity wasn't so shockingly bad
across my time with the - the first time
I had my signal cut out I initially
thought I had bumped the earphone
causing it to pause while scratching an
itch but it turned out that with my
phone on the bed next to me even putting
my hands near my ears caused the signal
to cut out momentarily line of sight
range is a pathetic five meters but I
found that having my head
between my phone and the right earphone
caused issues even at that distance and
it gets worse with my phone in my pocket
and I'm a short dude right leaning
backwards is enough to cause the signal
to crackle momentarily or even drop for
up to a second at a time any body of
water and we're made of water folks is
enough to screw up the connectivity
which means final conclusion time that
in spite of all the positive things I
had to say about this product in spite
of all its innovative features and
clever design elements I simply cannot
recommend it even at half the price at
$300 especially it's not enough to be a
really cool touch controlled 4 gig in
your mp3 player oh yeah you don't have
to use bluetooth it does have 4 gigs of
storage but the wireless connectivity
also has to work
sorry braggy better luck next time I
hope that you survive long enough to
bring a dash to to market to take on the
slew of similar products that have
already started popping up between your
Kickstarter campaign and now because I
mostly really like what you've done here
so let's say you're building a mobile
app and you're looking for a solution
that unlike today's product doesn't get
90% of the way there and then fall flat
on his face maybe you want to check out
Braintree their code for easy online
payments led to you ad payments to your
mobile app very simply with the
Braintree V zero SDK which is one small
snippet of code you can be all set up in
less than 10 minutes and they even have
support staff to walk you through the
process over the phone if you need them
- their code supports Android iOS and
JavaScript clients and they have SDKs in
seven seven programming languages they
make it easy to offer multiple mobile
payment types including PayPal Apple
paid Bitcoin venmo cards and more all
with a single integration so to learn
more and get your first $50,000 in
transactions fee
three I mean who else is going to offer
you that go to Braintree payments comm
