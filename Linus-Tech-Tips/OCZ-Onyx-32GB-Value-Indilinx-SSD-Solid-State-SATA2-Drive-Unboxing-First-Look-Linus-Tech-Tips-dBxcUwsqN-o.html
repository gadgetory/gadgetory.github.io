that any SSD was going to cost you
hundreds of dollars but we finally
gotten to the point where SSDs are
reaching the sub hundred dollar mark so
ocz has their onyx series of drives
these feature an in delinks barefoot
controller just like their higher end
agility and vertex drives but the
difference is that it does have lower
end flash memory on it so that means
that in terms of your maximum
performance you only get up to 125
megabyte per second reads and 70
megabyte per second rights so it does
suffer a little bit in terms of
performance compared to a more premium
drive but the advantage is that you're
still going to absolutely smoked a
magnetic hard drive in terms of the
random performance so for little things
like OS and you also have the option of
course if you're worried about those
sustain reads and writes of rating these
drives up so this is a bit of this
unboxing is meant to be a bit of a lead
in to another episode I'm going to be
doing shortly if I can ever get the Box
open then that would really be a major
step towards having that happen for me
here oh okay nevermind this doesn't feel
as badly as I thought okay so we just
pop that open there we are and then we
open up the drive so I've actually got
eight of these and I'm going to be
running them all on a RAID controller to
see what kind of numbers we can get if
we team up a bunch of entry-level drives
on a RAID controller versus running one
higher enjoy so here we are we have an
installation guide in warranty info ocz
covers this I believe for three years
limited warranty should be on the
backhoe two years on onyx drives so you
do get a slightly shorter warranty but
in terms of price they are not even
close to the other drive so you got to
kind of take the good with the bad it
looks like their standard SSD Drive so
you've got a nice black housing this is
a two-and-a-half-inch drive so it is
compatible with either desktop or
notebook computer on the back you find a
sticker that you shouldn't remove
because then your warranty will be void
and at the back of the drive you find a
standard SATA power and say tattoo
data interface thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the ocz onyx and
hopefully you'll stay tuned on my blog
for the interesting video that I'm going
to have coming up as soon as I have time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
