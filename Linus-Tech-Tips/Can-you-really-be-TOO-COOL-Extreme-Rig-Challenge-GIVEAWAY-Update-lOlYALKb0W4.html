for your favorite Xtreme rigs a trig
challenge intel.com could there be such
a thing as too cool I personally don't
think so
but if there were then the system's
being built in this year's intel extreme
rig challenge would definitely come
close that's right the extreme rape
challenge is not only back but now the
nine contestants are well into building
their mean machines and have each
release their second wave of build blog
videos and this time it is all about
cool digital storm is cooling Barre
system with over four feet of radiators
with a custom LED lit fluid distribution
block and gold fittings meanwhile zayed
axes double decker PC also has a triple
rad setup with an 18 fan radiator bed as
well as two more smaller radiators for
their second motherboard that is cool
and main gear is deploying their
industry first fully integrated cooling
system with pressure regulated parallel
flow to the CPU and graphics cards using
over 70 fittings that alone are worth
nearly a thousand dollars so what does
one do with so much cool well they're
cooling off the Intel Core i nine
extreme edition processors that power
each rig riding the mighty Steve that is
the Asus x2 99 XC motherboard this
overclockable cpu has Intel turbo boost
max technology 3.0 so it can boost two
of its 18 cores up to super high
frequencies and it's got 44 PCI Express
Lanes for maximum scalability and the
whole thing ain't over yet in the third
and final batch of logs the teams will
be highlighting their peripherals RAM
and best of all Intel octane 900p SSD
this is Intel state-of-the-art nvme
Drive featuring 3d crosspoint technology
for incredibly low latency fast load
times and
seamless transitions speaking of
seamless transitions remember that you
someone of perhaps only average coolness
actually have a chance to win a select
rig by simply casting your vote a trig
