impromptu unboxing I here in the crazy
Russian laboratory which is actually
messier than usual you guys going to do
something about this I mean look at this
beats headphones who leaves this kind of
stuff lying around disgusting anyway
back to the product that I'm unboxing
today so this is AMD's radeon edition
memories so i don't know if you guys
remember this but when they first
launched the AMD memory there was
entertainment edition performance
edition and there was supposed to be
radeon edition but it never materialized
it's finally here so the Radeon grade
memory is clocked at higher frequencies
than the entertainment and performance
edition series of memory other than that
the heat spreader is very similar the
aesthetic is very similar the whole idea
behind it is very similar where they're
using J deck timing so that you don't
have any difficulty with compatibility
and controlling the bomb that is the
Bill of Materials the stuff being used
in it so that compatibility will be
optimized for AMD system so all those
concepts are still there with the radeon
series having slightly more performance
in this case the memory that i've got
right here is actually running at
eighteen sixty six megahertz however the
timings are a little bit on oh no these
are cl9 1.5 volts so actually these are
these look pretty good ok so blah blah
blah low profile heat spreader usher's
protection and high compatibility
testing running frequencies up to 1866
and programmed with da tak timings so
all this should be pretty
straightforward remember guys just
because it's AMD memory doesn't mean it
only works in AMD systems it'll also
work in an intel system just fine the
kid i have here is a 2 by 4 gig kit
although they are available in a wide
variety of different configurations so
here you can see what they mean by
low-profile heat spreader so it's pretty
much right even with the top of the PCB
which means no matter what kind of a
heatsink you got going on on your cpu
you're not going to have any difficulty
with clearance i mean some memory out
here here's a perfect example a patriot
viper kit that has sort of a higher heat
spreader on it might have compatible
I issues so they're that pretty much
covers it so if you've got an AMD system
and you want AMD memory to go with it
because it has like a sweet black PCB
and sweet black and red color scheme
then you could go with AMD memory to
match your sweet black and red color
schemes thanks for checking out this
