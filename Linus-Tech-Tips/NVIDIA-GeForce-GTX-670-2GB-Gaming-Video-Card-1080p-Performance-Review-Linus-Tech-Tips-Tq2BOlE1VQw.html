again so we're going to be taking a look
in this video at the 1080p performance
of the all-new GeForce GTX 670 from
Nvidia so you can see here I've actually
got a variety of GTX 670 s most of which
I did unboxings of already so you can
see I've got a few reference cards this
one's factory overclocked this one's not
this is one's a direct Nvidia card I've
got them set up with a 3-way SLI bridge
so that's a bit of a hint of what one of
my other videos is going to be about I
have also got a non reference card so
this is with a dual slot cooler this
one's going to be cool because it's
going to go head-to-head against a
sapphire HD 7950 that has a similarly
designed cooler so we can take a look at
them you know which one has more coil
wine or less coil wine which one has a
better cooling solution since galaxy and
sapphire are both key partners for
Nvidia and AMD respectively this will be
a really interesting head-to-head
because these are similarly priced
products now in terms of the overall mix
I'm not testing a ton of games today
guys and I apologize for that but
honestly I just am a little bit a little
bit constrained in terms of what I can
do right now so I'm going to be doing
Crysis 2 battlefield 3 Skyrim and which
or two and this is the selection of
cards that I'm going to be taking a look
at we're going to be looking at the
1080p performance and then I'm going to
have a separate video where I'm also
going to cover things like the physical
power and noise I'm going to take a look
at 3d vision performance compared to the
last generation gtx 570 that this new
670 replaces we're going to do an OC
guide seeing what kind of performance we
can get compared to a 680 as well as oh
yeah there it is there's that hint there
for the sli scaling video now before I
go any further yes I covered this in the
unboxings but I just want to give you
guys a brief overview so the 670 is
basically a slightly cut-down version of
the GTX 680 NVIDIA has made fewer cuts
than usual however because it still has
the 256 memory and bit memory interface
with 6 gigahertz gddr5 it only has some
of the cuda cores cut away
and a slight reduction in clock speed
giving you again that's that slight
performance reduction now you can see
the reference cards are actually very
short PCBs so these are very power
efficient these are very cool running
they don't need beefy coolers and you
can see they only have dual six pin
connectors even though these are high
end graphics cards this is cool too this
is some of the other sort of slight
finishing touches that you see from the
board partners galaxies gone ahead and
put a slightly different back plate on
there's MSI has actually slightly
adjusted the positioning of the slots
compared to the reference one and yeah
so let's get going shall we now there
are a couple critical details before we
really get started and that is test
benches and the driver revisions that
are being used for so for the GTX 670
I'm using the publicly available beta
driver three oh one point three four
whereas for other Nvidia cards I'm using
three oh one point two four for all AMD
cards and using the latest twelve point
four drivers my test bench is a four
point four gigahertz 3930k from Intel so
that is an overclocked processor with 16
gigs of kingston hyperx ram at ddr3 1600
I'm using a gigabyte ah what's it called
X 79 AUD sex I mean IU d7 motherboard
this is sort of like the spiritual
successor to their previous generation
OC board so that's going to allow me to
run up to four graphics cards in SLI or
crossfire should the should the need
arise and then for a boot drive using
the Chronos deluxe 120 gig and for power
supply the ZX 12 50 watt 80 plus gold
power supply from OCZ
we'll be dealing with that side of
things for cooling I'm going to be using
come on focus please and h100 which will
keep my processor at a reasonable
temperature during all this testing for
Crysis 2 we'll be mixing things up a
little bit I'm going to be using the
ultra preset since all of the cards that
I'm using are very high-end cards I
still hate motion blur so I'm keeping
that on medium and I'm going to be using
high res textures this time around once
again to try and strain these cards as
much as I can so I'm going to do this a
little differently and I'm going to
one game at a time in terms of the
analysis so here you can see the crisis
to 1080p ultra performance here is the
GTX 670 which puts in a very very strong
performance because while the average
frames per second are below the 7970
check this out the actual minimum frame
rate of the 670 was above the HD 7970 so
that means that when you see a dip in
the action you're going to see pretty
much the same dip with a 670 as with a
79 70 which is outstanding and remember
to guys you know there's stuff that sort
of within margin of error here but in
general that shows us that this is a
very very strong card and when you
compare it against it's more similarly
priced competitor the 7950 the
difference becomes much more pronounced
although bear in mind the 7950 is an
outstanding overclocker which will allow
it to put some distance between itself
in the 7870 which had stock speed have
well put it put on a pretty good show
for this for this performance review as
well for battlefield 3 I'll be doing my
usual two-minute run-through in the
comrades level in the parkade and I will
also be using battlefield 3 to measure
the maximum power draw as well as
maximum noise and low temperatures of
the GPUs now yes I realize these are not
the maximum loads that I could create
with this system but I'm looking for a
more realistic scenario so what I'm
going to do is I find a particular van
in the parking lot when I'm done my
run-through and I shoot it until it
starts smoking and some effects get
going and that's how I've been able to
generate a pretty good peak power draw
and then I'm going to sit there and
stare at it and get all of those stats
before I close the game also for
Battlefield 3 we will be running
everything on ultra in battlefield 3 of
the GTX 670 sits very comfortably with
its competition the 7950 hold on wonders
move that cursor so you can see that in
terms of the average frame rate it is
quite a bit higher than even the 79 50
and even is competitive with the 7970
although when the action gets intense
you'll see a dip more like a 79 50 as
opposed to like a 79 70
and it's it's sort of exactly where
you'd expect it to be behind its younger
brother the GTX 680 I think it should be
noted that this is a huge generational
leap in performance compared to the card
that it's replacing I mean these are
staggering numbers and you'll continue
to see that throughout the rest of this
performance evaluation of this card once
again the 7870 puts on a pretty good
show considering its price point though
as well for Skyrim I'll be doing my
usual two laps around the town of
Whiterun and I will be using ultra
presets which means everything you know
all the view distances are at max and
everything is pretty ultra and fabulous
also I am using the stock high-res
texture pack now battlefield 3 was a bit
of an anomaly for me bear in mind guys I
mentioned this before but I'm using a
different driver on the GTX 670 than I
am on the GTX 680 so I would expect that
once the GTX 680 catches up in terms of
the driver revisions that we're going to
see a similar performance boost however
what this basically means is that at
launch for all intents and purposes the
GTX 670 is the fastest card that I
tested in battlefield 3 which is no no
small matter and I mean you can see how
much ahead it is of even that's HD 7970
so if you play battlefield 3 the GTX 670
is going to be one of the cards on your
shortlist
I think and once again staggering
performance improvement over the last
generation gtx 570 almost a doubling of
minimum FPS the witcher 2 is so
demanding that i won't be altering my
usual test setup so you guys can see
here if my camera would ever focus
exactly what i am using to test these
cards bearing in mind of course this is
at 1080p and doing my usual run-through
um which if you guys have seen it before
then you know which runs from talking
about and if you haven't then you don't
but it's pretty good there's some combat
there's some trees there's some
buildings good stuff the witcher is such
a demanding game in the settings that
i'm running it out are just totally
unreasonable even for modern high end
cards but it still gives you an idea of
where everything's down
and so in terms of average FPS the GTX
670 falls right in with the 7950 about
where it's supposed to be we saw a bit
of a dip but something to note about the
Witcher is that it tends to just kind of
randomly hitch up and and the frames
just sort of tanked
unexpectedly sometimes so I don't know
how much you can really read into these
minimum fps I think that exploit explain
why they're all kind of around the same
level you know you can see the 7970 dips
below even a 7950 so so sort of take
that take all of that with a grain of
salt for this one I would be more
interested in the average fps
and once again we see a sizable
improvement over the previous generation
and about an expected gap between the
GTX 670 and the GTX 680 so just a couple
subjective things the GTX 680 exhibits a
tiny bit of coil whine better than the
reference cards from the red team that I
have in my testing suite and better than
the GTX 680 that I have but both the 680
and the 670 do have a little do make a
little bit more noise than the last
generation cards the fan has a bit of a
had a bit of a grind has a bit of a
grinding noise to it you can check out
my other video on the noise temperatures
and and power consumption of this card
it is extremely efficient so power
consumption wise it is very similar to a
GTX 570 but it offers dramatically
better performance and part of this may
be the smaller PCB I don't know but a
huge part of it is definitely the Kepler
GPUs that it's got going on in there
remember this card is also available in
four gig configurations and if you're
looking at running a giant resolution
like a 2560 by 1440 or 2560 by 1600
monitor or three monitors and surround I
would definitely look at picking up the
four gig version so thank you for
checking out my performance review of
the GTX 670 from Nvidia and don't forget
