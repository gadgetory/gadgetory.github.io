laptops with its thin tailored bezels
and stark black back with a logo pocket
square accent bringing it out of your
bag says you don't have time for someone
to be late and that the meeting notes
you take will be both somehow
exceptionally thorough and concise but
is the x1 just a suit or is there more
substance behind it like the substance
bringing you this video though tacks MEK
1 gaming pc its ultra slim and features
a sleek robotic styled design check it
out at the link below to learn more
that's not really good substance is it
tomorrow product
the build quality of the ThinkPad x1
carbon is exceptional with a very stiff
chassis especially considering how light
it is and it's got plastics that feel
soft and good on the hands the overall
feel of it is more like a tool or a
piece of equipment which might not
appeal to folks who gravitate towards
prettier devices like the surface laptop
or Dell XPS but will to others and you
know who you are you're the kind of
person who wants a thin in light but
also still wants to plug stuff into it
and that's what we've got a smattering
of type A and type C USBs Thunderbolt 3
HDMI and Ethernet with pass-through to
their proprietary dock a very important
feature for accessing your corporate
network when you are docked
performance-wise you've got the pick of
the litter with 8th gen Intel you series
processors from a core i5 all the way up
to the core i7 8650 you although it
should be noted that lenovo tuned the
cpu in their top config to 15 watts so
Dells XPS 13 actually performs better
with a lower tier processor though not
by much
over a half hour stress test but
ThinkPad x1 carbon reached around 90
degrees which is a little on the hot
side but wasn't enough for it to thermal
throttle putting it ahead in performance
of basically every other thin enlight
that we've tested and the keyboard
that's another strong point with its
long 18 millimeter key travel and super
satisfying tactile bump it's a solid
contender for best notebook keyboard on
the market compared to say the MacBook
Pro and don't think I can actually hit
the same peak speed for short burst e
messages but if I had to type for hours
I would much rather use the x1 which I
can easily do with it's over 6 hours of
battery life and while we're praising
the keyboard isn't it about time that
somebody put snipping tool' on the Print
Screen button
now the trackpad this is also good but
maybe not as excellent the tracking and
feel is solid and satisfying but pulling
out the macbook pro for comparison
reminded me how nice it would be if I
could click on the whole thing and how
small it is like I realized that the
options are either a small trackpad or a
mouse nipple so it's not a simple choice
but I'm personally not a TrackPoint guy
so yes sorry sorry everyone but I would
actually like to see that vertical space
used another way now there are two
screen options that really stick out
with the X one with the most interesting
being the new 2560 by 1440 glossy finish
with HDR side by side even dang this
thing is nice to look at at this size
you really don't need 4k but the extra
sharpness at 1440p is more than welcome
than the colors brightness and black
levels all blew me away which is all
fine and good if you're buying a laptop
for watching movies but given how how do
I put this gently a bad yeah yeah that's
the word I was looking for bad the
speaker sound movies are probably not
what you want this for you want it to
use between nine and five so actually
out of the two displays we tried the
1080p with touch is the one that got the
most use it's matte finish is great when
you have to work under fluorescent
lights and I'm never going to turn down
the opportunity to navigate using my
screen unfortunately I do really like
unlocking my computer with my face and
facial recognition sign in is only
available on the higher res model
forcing me to use the fingerprint reader
to the right of the trackpad which by
the way is the wrong place anywhere but
the power button these days
is the wrong place though to lenovo's
credit while their reader isn't as fast
as the dell XPS or the LG gram it uses
match on chip technology for an
additional layer of security so I won't
be docking any points what I will be
docking points for though is the webcam
I do like the additional security of
being able to just flip it shut so that
no one can be spying on me in the event
that my computer is compromised but when
it isn't disabled quite frankly it is
just not good enough for a webcam in
2018 especially on a business SKU that
is presumably going to be used for
conference calls taking apart the
ThinkPad x1 carbon is pretty easy but
doesn't give you access to a whole lot
of upgrade options the storage is
upgradable which is nice but the RAM is
not so make sure you grab enough when
you're buying though hmm now that I
think about it should you buy one of
these the pricing makes a clear
recommendation here actually kind of
difficult at regular price it is a big
fat no but lenovo was really cagey about
whether the promotional prices on their
website were actually promos or if they
were just attempts to make you feel like
you're getting a special deal every day
so if the price you pay is closer to
what was on the site when we were
shooting this about 1350 to start that
is still more than an XPS but for
business use the sim slot could
massively improve productivity in the
field and then back in the office the x1
will make the IT department happy as a
clam to when it's connected to the dock
MAC address pass-through PXE boot and
wake-on-lan along with all of the
additional security features
superfish notwithstanding will allow
your company to be productive during the
day and sleep well at night speaking of
being productive during the day
