brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries guys over the last
little while we have had a metric butt
ton of WD stuff to give away we gave
away a bunch of drives down at PAX we
had people telling us about their
storage configurations and doing
embarrassing stuff and getting external
drives and internal drives for their
trouble but now we're following it up
with the big giveaway we have eight four
terabyte WD red drives to give away on
the Linus tech tips forum all you've got
to do is post in the thread and we'll be
linking it in an annotation somewhere
linking it in the video description and
tell us about your storage configuration
with particular emphasis on why you're
using the components you're using so a
great example would be you know I use a
bhoot SSD because I wanted the speed but
I have a hard drive because I needed
extra storage for my games because I
have a big massive collection on Steam
and you know I would have an external
drive but you know I can't afford one
right now or so that would be a great
example of like why you're using all the
components you're using so why would you
want WD red drives well the answer is
because they're optimized for nests so
Nazz is great because it allows you to
centralize your storage in one place it
allows you your storage to be safer
because even in the event of a physical
failure raid will often protect your
data and because you know they're rated
for 24/7 operation they have 24/7 tech
support they've got their nas where
firmware which means that they are not
gonna you know fall out of a raid
they're validated with all the different
rating closures and all that good stuff
they're less susceptible to interference
from vibrations from surrounding drives
and all those good things
LED Reds will definitely be a good part
of whatever storage configuration you
happen to tell us about so guys check
out the link in the forum for the full
rules and regulations and if you're not
done watching this video go ahead and
check out this entertaining montage all
right so we have challenged this we have
we have challenged this contestant here
who unfortunately had the misfortune of
recognizing us here in the crowd to
gather at least half a dozen people to
stand and listen to him talk about how
awesome WD is
for but--and you had a single you had a
one terabyte drive for storage so we'd
like to double your storage today so
that's a 2 terabyte drive for storage so
thank you very much for participating
thank you all right and then for the
other guys here I'm gonna give away at
least oh I've got some good stuff in
here so I'd like to have the ED let's
see what should we make them do
ma'am so I need you that I need you to I
need you to do a lap of this courtyard
screaming Western Digital and if I can't
hear you from here when you're in that
other corner it's not gonna count and
I'm gonna send you around again you down
correct get some crowd reaction here we
got some month
I got I got one of these for you though
this is a one terabyte WD my passport
external drive so thank you very much
for participating in our extremely
humiliating well you go to Western
Digital black so you clearly appreciate
high-performance hard drives I want you
to take this one terabyte Western
Digital velociraptor I want you
definitely that drive alright thanks man
be thankful is thanks I want you to go
from 500 terabytes which is actually 500
gigs that's okay we all make that
mistake I want you to have a one
terabyte Blu drive take that so you're
gonna have more storage now and since
you already have pretty pretty Rock and
set up you're going to get an external
drive this is a one terabyte my passport
from WD so I didn't even really make you
guys do anything for it this time around
but the sheer spectacle of someone
handing me an optical drive to sign was
I was worth it for me where do you want
it all right there we go
all right thanks guys really nice to
meet you all right a wd one terabyte my
passport so you can use that as external
storage it's USB three so you can
install you can run steam off of it you
can just put your music movies and all
your cool files on there no big deal
that's awesome awesome no no there's
more right so I have either a
velociraptor one terabyte giving you the
maximum in speed but lesser capacity or
I have a WD green 2 terabyte this is the
new generation ease at rx Drive which
actually performs significantly better
than the last gen Green Drive you're
gonna go with the raptor ok now because
you did manage to get some high fives
I'd like you to pick a winner out of
your compatriots here who hasn't won
already all right well you have won on
the basis of his humiliating act a 2
terabyte Western Digital green drive can
you tell me about the storage
configuration your computer with
particular emphasis on why you have the
components you have alright I have a 240
Corsair SSD and that is it that's it so
you have no storage at all why don't you
have any storage really well I just
bought it and I didn't want to spend the
money on extra storage so this is very
good timing for you very much so I just
run a Western Digital black drive
terabyte yep I like to keep it on single
Drive I don't like to do raid or
anything
120 gig OCZ SSD as a boot drive and then
on top of that for my mass storage I
have a 500 terabytes in digital
caviar blue I believe for ya mass
storage cuz it's a solid drive a 120 gig
840 SSD for boot and programs and then I
have a one terabyte black question
digital drive for storage and games

I need you to help me to win some
Western Digital flag yes so I believe
our chance is Western Digital is awesome
you gotta make it loud alright
it's not a chant of its once alright
why do you run what you run because you
told me to I picked up a couple of
Western Digital Red's and I'm running
them in in rate whatever the good one is
all the redundancy I got three terabytes
now because I kept losing all my stuff
wow that's actually that's pretty good
that's the if it's not a lie it's the
best one someone's come up with do you
use how'd you use an SSD for your OS I
do I've got a 240 Samsung alright cool

in here that is going to make a whole
lot of sense for you I yes we do okay so
