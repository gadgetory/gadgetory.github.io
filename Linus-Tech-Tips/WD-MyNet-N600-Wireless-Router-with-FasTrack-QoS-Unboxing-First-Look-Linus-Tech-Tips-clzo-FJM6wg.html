Western Digital and we're gonna start
with the lowest one because that's
always the hardest when you have an
entire series of products and started
talking about the cool features that are
present is taking the lowest end one out
of the entire product stack and figuring
out what's exciting about it in this
case it's not actually that difficult
because the myNet series of routers has
what really one key feature that goes
above and beyond boys I don't know
anyone else is doing it's called fast
track so a fast track is as WD describes
it and fast track stop waiting start
watching smooth HD streaming to your
smart TVs tablets smartphones computers
and other connected devices so it is
quality of service that rather than
setting up manually within like a QoS
menu inside the web interface for your
router and logging into that and you
know manually putting things into it
which is kind of a chore every time you
have some new game and you have to build
some new profile just to make sure that
it's prioritized it's sort of stupid so
fast track the idea is you turn it on
and based on profiles that wd builds for
the my net and 600 as well as the n750
it will just kind of automatically
prioritize the things that need extra
bandwidth and it will reserve bandwidth
for them so that they don't like and
they don't stutter with the mine at 900
it actually recognizes the shape of the
traffic and dynamically adjusts so it'll
go oh that looks like a game and it will
dynamically reserve bandwidth for it
even without WD rolling out profiles in
their firmware but with the lower end
ones you do have to rely on the profiles
from Western Digital this particular
router is a dual band 300 plus 300
megabits per second router so effective
in 600 speed good range really they put
that on there good range easy sab
fast-track teaming full HD 1080p okay it
better be if it's a look at this I have
a convenient product comparison here
tube so range is house and then there's
a bigger house and there's a really big
house okay
fast track fast track fast track plus is
the adaptive one very cool
ten hundred Ethernet port so it does
have fast wireless but only fast
ethernet fast ethernet it isn't fast
anymore it's gigabit ethernet is the
faster one one USB 2.0 port so Western
Digital is a storage company so it
stands to reason that they would want to
you know I don't know configure their
routers so that you can add storage
servers so something like a my book life
would be a perfect companion for one of
their not for one of their my net
routers in fact if you use a my book
live you can even enable additional
features like apples file protocol so
you can use time capsule that's what
it's called right time capsule time
machine time capsule I think hold on yeh
Google time capsule is the Apple device
that has storage inside of it that
allows you to use time machine to backup
your pcs over the network so this will
behave kind of like a time capsule once
you attach a qualified external drive to
it otherwise you don't get that Apple
protocol and you can still use it as
storage but just not with the extra
features so in terms of the physicality
of it you got a power LED wireless LED
interwebs LED and W WEP WPA you got
Wi-Fi Protected ya WPA wwp s there's the
button for WPS which sort of next to the
LED indicator which means that I should
probably realize that at some point in
time there's your power button on the
back mmm toggle power button DC in for
fast ethernet ports remember fast
doesn't mean fast fast means not as fast
which is okay because this is a lower
end product
there's your LAN port there's your USB
storage port and there's your
ventilation holes and other than that
there's not much else to say about it I
mean it's you know simple to set up I
suppose let's see if they have a
QuickStart guide so start here start
didn't see yeah okay one two three steps
for Mac one two three steps for - hey
ironically the one two three steps for
Windows actually look a lot simpler than
the one two three steps for Mac uh-huh
there's a disk you can use that if you
want it comes with an Ethernet cable
comes with a power adapter and
comes with techno the sportin limited
warranty guide with whole bunch of
numbers all over the world that some of
them not even make any sense to me
how many Oh that's three different phone
numbers I was like is that a phone
number
Singapore I mean Singapore they must be
have to remember like 30 digits just to
call somebody thank you for checking out
my unboxing your first look at the my
net and 600 from Western Digital don't
forget to subscribe to I inspected from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and I did mention it was dual
bang but I didn't mention its 2.4
gigahertz I'm 5 gigahertz which is what
dual band means but not everyone knows
that don't forget to subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
