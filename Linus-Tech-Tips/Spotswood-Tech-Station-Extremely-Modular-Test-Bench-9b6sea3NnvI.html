they're called Spotswood taxations Thera
and they're pretty obscure coolermaster
v-series semi modular power supplies
feature 80 plus gold efficiency and
their gold guarantee five-year warranty
click now to learn more so I bought the
Spotswood tech station for a personal
project of mine which will be in a bill
blog update video in the future but some
of you may know that we use high speed
PC tech stations for our tech stations
at work
so why deviate from what I know is
already good I mean I've been using high
speed PC tech stations for years I've
never had a problem why you something
else outside of work honestly
the main reason was looks but outside of
that I appreciate that it is made
entirely of aluminum it's extremely
modular and every one of its arms is a
mountable rail so you can put anything
on it that you want I really liked how
you can put a radiator virtually
anywhere so I went through the ordering
process which was great by the way
rich chum accesskey AKA Spotswood helped
i said his last name right is very
accommodating and seemed to go out of
his way to answer every question I had
very quickly upon receiving the unit I
was happy to see that he did a great job
packing it with gratuitous amounts of
bubble wrap and tons of packing peanuts
as well for an independent the packing
material was great
tons of peanuts and bubble wrap had the
bench actually quite secure before it
showed up first thing you'll notice is
that the tech station is in two halves
it goes together very easily and it's
quite secure once you have it in place
next up you'll notice the accessories oh
my god the accessories there are so many
the amount of bolts nuts and washers
this guy included is insane and it
doesn't stop there he also included all
the different mounting brackets and arms
you could possibly want and all of these
things came in
nice little resealable bags that are
nicely labeled other than a couple
brackets I didn't order anything extra
and everything you can see right now is
just the leftovers that didn't end up on
the tech station there will be no kit
limitations here the only complaint I
can see anyone having about the
accessories is that they are all hex
bolts which can be kind of annoying
because you can't use your standard
screwdrivers with them but not only two
spots would include the three different
hex keys needed to install everything
but if this is a bench that you'll be
taking to something like a LAN or any
public place the added security of say
your graphics card not being able to be
removed by a simple thumb screw in a
matter of like three to ten seconds is
kind of nice
next up we have the tech station itself
starting from the top of the station we
have these standoffs which I wished were
installed by default as it shows in
Spotswood pictures but it's not a very
big deal as they're very easy to install
also with the standoffs and the open
rail system it is very easy to access
the back of the motherboard which will
make CPU block swaps a breeze speaking
of the open rail system for those of you
that may want to install motherboards
that are not ATX format all the rails
are easily adjustable and even removable
by simply loosening or removing the
bolts that are at the rail intersections
even the expansion card support bar is
adjustable just in case you may have
short expansion cards like maybe a raid
or sound card although I expect most
people to leave this bar exactly where
it is then we come to the power supply
mounting I really wasn't so sure about
this before I started working on the
unit but once you install the power
supply there it's actually quite nice
the cables don't look messy up top due
to the cable management hole created by
the motherboard support rails and it
leaves you with more room to be creative
with what you want to do on the lower
level but you may notice the Wii U game
no unfortunately this tech station does
not come with Mario Kart 8 for Wii U I
put it there to support the power supply
as it is roughly the same thickness as
one of the aluminum rails which is
already holding up one side of the power
supply unit well I do mostly trust the
standard mounting setup it sketches me
out that there is no support for the
bottom of the power supply on that side
now this power supply isn't necessarily
short but it isn't long either if you
had a long power supply like the one I
intend to eventually install in this
test bench it will reach to the second
motherboard support bar but if you don't
it will just kind of hang there all of
this in mind it's probably fine I'm sure
Spotswood knows about this as the power
supply unit in his pictures is roughly
the same length as the one that I have
on the bench and he probably didn't see
it as a problem I don't see it as one
necessarily either as long as the tech
station is left alone if someone was to
wrest something on top of the power
supply or bump it it's
possible that something bad could
potentially happen and however unlikely
the situation is I personally would rest
easier if it was just supported hence
the Wii U game all of that aside we can
move on to the bottom of the tech
station first off we have the hard drive
and SSD mounting which is essentially
the same process and it can take a
little while but once they're in place
it's actually quite secure and it has a
bit of vibration dampening due to the
rubber mounting solution which is a nice
added bonus due to the spacing
differences of three and a half and two
and a half inch drives you would need to
install them on different rails if you
wanted to do it properly but what
exactly is properly when working on a
tech station which caters to creativity
I don't know but I will likely be buying
a hard drive cage either from Spotswood
or some other vendor to free up some
real estate in the bottom of this tech
station as multiple drives take up quite
a bit of space if I wasn't interested in
buying an extra cage I would likely end
up fixing the SSD to one of the rails
just below the motherboard just to get
out of the way secondly there was
mounting my radiator the process of
fixing the tab system to the radiator
and taxation through the use of the
standard bolt nut and washer method was
easy enough to do and looks quite sharp
once you're done but you may again
notice the way your game no yet again
sadly it does not come with Super Mario
Bros u or super Luigi u and this is
another one of my ghetto mounted support
systems being only able to mount my
thick and heavy alpha cool neck success
radiator which by the way will only get
heavier once you run water through it on
one side of the tech station causes it
to torque and pull down on the far
non-secured side now again it's probably
okay but I especially don't trust this
one as it seems to be talking much more
than the power supply was and has the
same kind of issues if someone bumps
into it or if I say accidentally pull it
while trying to install a fitting it
could get torqued too much and I would
be livid because of this I got my trusty
Wii U game mounting system before it was
even fully installed this is something I
will be finding a proper and more
permanent solution to before I move my
personal rig to this tech station Taryn
and I were able to come up with a few
potential solution
- this radiator mounting problem one if
we had longer tabs we could fit it to
the bottom of the tech station as well
meaning it would have two points of
contact to another rail I could install
myself on the other side would add
another two points of contact and
supported on both sides or three a rail
mountable rubber pad system which could
replace my Wii U game in its exact same
form and function in conclusion is this
the easiest thing to build on No but
it's damn fun the Spotswood tech station
is extremely high build quality overall
and allows you to do almost anything
that you want with it because of how
modular it is that being said the almost
non-existent documentation can be more
than a little annoying when trying to
figure out how you're intended to do
something and there's so few build
examples out in the while that some of
the issues I ran into could have
honestly just did myself failing to
understand how something was intended to
work especially since I may have been
doing this build well streaming at 3:00
in the morning last but not least is the
purchasing experience again rich Thomas
Sweatt ski hope I'm saying that right
aka Spotswood as far as I can tell is a
one-man operation and despite that he
managed to keep on top of things very
well
I received shipping confirmation
surprisingly quickly after ordering my
unit and he continues to this day to
answer any and all of my questions both
quickly and thoroughly alright guys
