monitor it's got a 240 hertz refresh
rate g-sync and 1 millisecond response
times
I mean gaming on this thing is way
better than gaming on this cheapo HP
what is it 6 times better now take this
one this $5,000 8k workstation monitor
for creatives it is way better to look
at than this peasant trash but is it 55
0.55 repeating times better well your
mental math is correct this monitor is
only $90 and welcome back to another
episode of why the actual holy had put
ice and friendly content are you guys
all buying this the best-selling monitor
on amazon.com and what could be more
sponsor friendly advertiser friendly
everyone friendly then today's sponsor
LTX for hosting the LTX 2018 live event
on July 14th it's an interactive Meetup
check out and PC gaming extravaganza get
your ticket today at the link below
the pavillion 22 CWA the best-selling
monitor on amazon.com has over 3600
reviews and an average rating of 4.4
stars and admittedly it does look a
little out of place next to the kinds of
products that we typically cover on this
channel but don't let its diminutive 21
and a half inch size and superlight
eight and a half pound weight fool you
this monitor is a hundred percent pretty
not bad just check out those colors so
what's the deal here well it's not just
that HP is selling a cheap monitor in
fact the number three bestseller is only
65 bucks it's that they're selling a
cheap monitor that's equipped with an
IPS panel while these other cheapies are
sporting your run-of-the-mill TN panels
but HP doesn't make LCD panels they
source them from other manufacturers so
if I take a spudger like this and work
it around the edge I might be able to
see who actually made this thing so the
sticker says LM to15 wf3 which according
to the internet is an LG panel with a
full 1920 by 1080 resolution typical
brightness of 250 nits and a bit color
but what's really interesting is that if
I type that model number into Amazon I
get a page full of replacement 2012 to
2014 IMAX screens and for over $200 so
either these prices have a heavy Apple
tax applied to them or HP secured an
awesome deal with LG because 90 bucks
for an IMAX screen ain't half bad plus
you aren't just getting the panel HP is
providing you with the casing stand IO
and their one-year limited warranty
which is of course required by law and
the casing itself isn't too bad either
it's made of not terrible quality
plastic that doesn't
easily get covered in fingerprints and
it is slim all the way around though of
course they did have to cut some corners
somewhere to get the price down and the
stand is the worst offender it offers no
swivel no pivot or height adjust
whatsoever though it does include a
little bit of tilt that you'll probably
need because the stand is so short and
that isn't even the worst part
it's that should you take the crappy
stand off and opt to use a third party
monitor arm instead perhaps in a
multi-monitor setup which these are
awesome for thanks to the thin bezels
it's not visa compatible so unless you
get an adapter for an extra twenty
dollars you're gonna have to get pretty
creative bringing us to vio it's pretty
Spartan you get one HDMI port and one
VGA port that's it I mean you probably
have low expectations for such a budget
product but just make sure that they're
low enough to also not be surprised when
there is no HDMI cable included in the
box so who should buy this monitor then
well if you want a secondary or tertiary
or quaternary screen for that matter to
supplement your main display or displays
the wide viewing angles here mean that
you can put it way off to the side
without much color Distortion as for
using it for your main display could you
use it for gaming sure while IPS
displays aren't known to have the
highest refresh rates or the fastest
pixel response times
this one's input lag is better than most
TVs and while you will see some smearing
and fast-moving scenes it's a far cry
better than value monitors from 10 years
ago
so do we recommend it actually yeah it's
a great value and if you're hung up on
the crappy stand don't worry an
additional 40 bucks will get you the
number two best-selling monitor which is
also from HP and basically the same
but an inch bigger and with a visa
compatible pivoting stand thermal takes
view 37 mid-tower case features an
enlarged transparent gull wing window
panel design with remarkable expansion
including support for motherboards of up
to e-atx dimensions with multiple drive
bays it's fully modular and supports
vertical and horizontal radiator
placement and comes with two
pre-installed ring 14 LED blue fans or
