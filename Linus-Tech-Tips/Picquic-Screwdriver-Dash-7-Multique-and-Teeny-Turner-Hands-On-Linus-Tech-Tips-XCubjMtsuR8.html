from Pickwick it's a Canadian company
basically where you've got the dash 7
which is right here we've got the teeny
Turner which is here and the multik so
we'll talk about these a little bit what
is special and unique about a picnic
screwdriver you can see I actually
started the packaging before we started
shooting
well what's unique about them is the way
you change bits basically you take any
bit from a pick quick screwdriver you
see which one you want okay we want a
large Phillips head you pop it through
and you insert it into the end really
cool system so the pick quick multik is
a slim design screwdriver that comes
with a zero one and two size Phillips
head and you can see right there what
other sized bits it comes with now all
of these screwdrivers are magnetic and
you can see here that you can actually
that's wow that's a weak magnet okay
well if I were them I wouldn't advertise
that too much but - anyway let's move on
to the next one
so now we've got the teeny Turner this
is a precision screwdriver so you can
see it comes with little tiny jeweler
style bits and so the bit load is
actually on the back of this one we've
got a zero size Philips a few Torx heads
and a couple slots so these are great
for fixing up your glasses or any other
toys installing batteries stuff like
that very cool little thing and the oh
the magnets quite a bit stronger on this
one and then we've got the dash 7 which
is sort of a higher-end screwdriver it's
thicker it's more rugged it's more
heavy-duty compared to the multik and
you can see that in the construction
here actually and then again it uses the
same pick quick bit loading system which
and yeah you can see this one is again
quite a bit more magnetic so that would
be the higher end one of the ones we're
looking at and the bit load for this one
has a few Phillips head a couple slots
and a couple of Roberts and screwdrivers
