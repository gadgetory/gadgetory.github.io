often this is a live unboxing video so
if you want to sweep around and see if a
crowd gathered today you know let's hear
some cheers and stuff live unboxing
video so don't go back to where you were
I don't know why you're Rebecca okay so
we're here at the nvidia 3d vision
surrounded demo and i am going to be
unboxing something that I've been
meaning to unbox for a while this is
something I first laid eyes on at CES
2011 is the ocz ZX series of power
supplies and more specifically I have
the 1250 watt power supply here with me
today so what's special about this well
what I think is special about it is that
it is one of the most new and
interesting power supply lines that's
come out of ocz in a good number of
years they've really refreshed their
overall image and their overall feature
set this is a fully modular power supply
it features 80 plus gold efficiency
which means that it's pretty much ninety
percent efficiency although for whatever
reason the 80-plus organization feels
that it would wreck their branding call
something 90-plus so they don't see the
need to pull anything that so it's 80
plus gold we're going to stick with that
technical specifications are right here
you can see the length and width which
will be fairly evident once I open the
box you can also see which standards it
comes equipped with it uses a one
hundred and forty millimeter ball
bearing cooling fan high efficiency
which we've talked about already it has
all of those over voltage / current
short-circuit protections that you would
expect to find on any decent power
supply and it features of 100,000 our
mean time between failure rate let's go
ahead and open this up and this is also
something they've really changed they
are using a completely different kind of
packaging for their power supplies which
I've never seen before but I will
struggle with it and I will open it for
you so we have a window where you can
see the fan I have no idea why that come
on why is there window here the box
doesn't have a window but that's okay
because as long as it's a good product
it can come in the most fail possible
box and I won't care we find inside here
probably modular cables as I mentioned
it is a fully modular power supply so
there's going to be a lot of modular
cables probably weighs about two pounds
so it's just
shadow there we are lots of color coded
cables in there we're going to have to
take those apart look at this it comes
with an 80 plus gold certificate so
normally when I say that a power supply
is 80 plus gold certified it doesn't
actually come with a certificate but
this one does so there you go all right
we've also got a manual neat and then
finally we've got probably some screws
and cable ties and power cord oh yeah
you can tell I've unboxed a power supply
before so here's the most easy velcro
cable ties big fan of these I still have
some from my original power stream power
supply they're the ones that I use to
tie back the cables on my test bench
comes with four thumb screws to mount
the power supply in your case as well as
a nice thick power cable that uses a
standard interface some of the higher
wattage units use that that funky one
that you're not bound to have a spare
handy if you need one and you left it at
work and you need the power supply to be
functional at home you don't have one
and you can't run your test bench so
yeah that's never happened to me before
actually it has all right power supply
itself so let's start with the power
supply okay so as I mentioned before
we've got a one hundred and forty
millimeter ball bearing fan doing the
cooling on here you can tell it's uses a
fairly standard 7 blade design I mean my
expectation is it be fairly quiet and
the reality is it's not going to have to
work very hard because even a 1250 watt
power supply when you're talking 80 plus
gold certification is very efficient and
is not going to kick out a whole ton of
excess heat on the side you find what
some people might find body but
personally i think is quite tasteful a
black gold and silver color scheme i
love this a lot of the 80 plus gold
units are doing this where they put a
little bit of gold back scenting on it I
think it's great you also find it upside
down on the other side there's a very
good reason for that because when its
installed in your case it will be up
right side up rather right side up
regardless of which way you install it
so those sides are both identical here
you will find the general specifications
you can see this is a single rail 12
volt power supply so that is a 104 amp
12 volt rail it's a good thing it has
all of those industrial protections on
it because if it didn't have over
current protection as well as short
circuit protection you could be frying
some pretty serious hardware that you
have hooked up to a power supply of this
testicular fortitude so here we go let's
have a look at our first modular cable
here this is the ATX power cable I'm
going to go ahead and plug that in
twenty four pins although you can split
away the last four pins if you're
actually still powering a 20 pin
motherboard with a 1250 watt power
supply we've got a couple of extra
capacitors here that are covered by heat
shrink tubing so those are presumably to
do something to help it deliver better
power I should certainly hope so next
let's have a look at what we got for
PCIe so these are all color-coded gray
we have one two three four five is an
odd number so there must be six we have
six PCI Express 8-pin connector so
that's interesting note these are all
six plus two so you can see the one end
and i'm just going to unwrap one of them
so you can see the general length we
have dedicated plugs for all of these so
you can plug in as many as you see fit
here is about the length of the cable is
approximately point nine of a Linus arms
so there's your six plus two there's
your interface that's all pretty
straightforward let's see what we've got
four SATA cables so this harness has 43
SATA cables on it you can see that it
uses these slim peripheral / IDE / SATA
connectors right there i'm going to show
you the length of that one as well
before we wrap this unboxing up actually
you never wrap an unboxing up the more
unbox it so anyway there that's the
length of that what else have we got so
total SATA cables included there's
another three there's another three and
I'm expecting to find probably one more
of those there's another three so you
can hook up a total of twelve SATA
drives natively to this power supply
without any adapters finally we have
three molex three molex and then a three
molex with a floppy connector at the end
just in case you actually still own
something that uses a floppy power
connector going to show you the length
of that once this is well over a line of
serum it's a Linus arm and arm fit and
then half of a torso
finally last but not least we have our 8
pin and probably a 4 plus 4 pin there it
is an 8-pin at a 4 plus 4 pin EPS
connector these look a little on the
short side you can see they're actually
this is neat they're clearly labeled PSU
and CPU so you know which end goes where
you may need an extension cable to get
this up to the top if you have a bottom
mounted power supply and you have a case
that doesn't have a very direct route to
the top of your motherboard so bear that
in mind extension cables are cheap you
can get the NZXT individually sleeved
ones for just a couple bucks so that's
probably a solution I'd recommend thank
you for checking out my unboxing today
of the 80-plus certified including
certificate ocz ZX 1250 power supply
