to cram more features into a motherboard
a soos brought out the rampage for
extreme so this particular one comes
with the full copy of battlefield 3 it
is PCIe gen3 ready which comes along
with the territory because this is an
Intel LGA 2011 socket motherboard with
the x79 chipset supporting core x i7
extreme and Core i7 processors on this
socket that is six core processors only
so far although there should be four
core processors and even more core
processors coming in the future
four-way SLI and crossfire support and a
wide wide range of other features so
let's get started here actually you know
what let's let's open up the board first
I'm gonna like shake things up a little
bit here and I'm gonna go ahead I'm
gonna get the board open I'm gonna get
the board out of the box which you can
see through the box
fairly well anyway so it's not not a
huge issue one way or the other but we
will talk about features as we show them
on this there we go alright so the
motherboard let's do the accessories
then we'll do the board itself and the
features when we are done with the
accessories so accessories I'm gonna
have to cover some of the features here
as well so check this out you guys this
is the LGA 2011 backplate Oh
so why does it happen LGA 2011 backplate
in the box you might ask well that is
actually because of a feature called
X socket which allows you to install
either elde an LGA 2011 native cooler or
actually if we just open up recently
closed tabs here X socket there we go
or if you check out these if you check
out the event on this use calm slash
2011 / ROG / x - socket website you can
actually see third party coolers that
support their X socket
technology which allows you to install
your 1366 cooler on LG 2011 boards that
include at socket technology which as
far as I know is just this one okay what
else we got here in terms of accessories
gamer UI gamer style to trace a champion
so there's a little ROG look at that
it's all shiny and like silver you put
that somewhere nice okay we got the
battlefield 3 game which you guys can't
see the code for we have a 3-way SLI
bridge a 4 Way SLI bridge a two-way SLI
bridge nice flexible black cable perfect
and finally a crossfire bridge once
again black perfect okay we've got there
what are they calling this now Pro belt
okay so that allows you to quickly check
your voltages on a variety of things
which will see when you open up the
board without our i/o shield we've got
our OG connect which allows you to
overclock your cpu and change settings
using the USB connection and an
additional computer we have the Oxnard
or zone our sound card so apparently
this board includes zone our technology
fascinating either that or this is just
oh no this seems to be just like an ad
for it
Oh interesting next we have a lanyard
full the battlefield battlefield 3
lanyard this is cool we'll get to this
after Taji connect cable ah USB cable
with some sort oh this is for the OSI
key which is also part of that so we'll
get to that later okay we've got one two
three four USB R SATA 3 six gigabit per
second cables those are all right angle
and then we have one two three four SATA
it's a two to three gigabit per second
cables and those are all right angle as
well
finally Q connectors which allow you to
do a front panel and at least one front
USB connector with additional ease and
now let's just go ahead and throw these
back in here and then let's whip out the
board itself because the board is what
you folks all paid good money to see and
I paid good money I mean didn't
anything at all here we go so this is
not quite a standard ATX board we've
seen Asus doing this with their Republic
of gamers level boards for quite some
time where they're widening the board
just a smidgen in order to cram on more
features so you can see here is where we
would normally have the board ending and
asus has put about another couple
centimeters of PCB where they've put a
lot of useful things why don't we start
with the cpu socket so there's our LGA
2011 socket that is a supporting core i7
and core i7 extreme processors and where
is the you know what I'm going to be
perfectly honest with you guys see
here's the backplate that's on here now
I actually don't understand exactly how
X socket is going to work based on what
I've seen so far but the theory is that
it does work and that's good okay as
long as the cooler supports it so that's
that's the key part around the sides of
the socket we have our eight DIMM slots
so yes asus has managed even on their
top tier performance board to provide a
Dem slots if you are installing only
four dims I would definitely recommend
you use the red slots because those ones
are slightly further away from the CPU
socket giving you a little bit more room
for bulky coolers and a little bit of
additional airflow around your socket
speaking of coolers we've got our vo RM
coolers here and here Asus has
integrated their new generation of digi+
vrm on this particular board which means
that you have dedicated digital voltage
regulators not only for the CPU but also
for the memory which just means
additional components that they had to
build into this board you can actually I
mean you can clearly see how dense the
PCB is every square inch of it is
covered with something CPU power
connectors we have one eight pin and one
four pin connector you do not have to
use both of them although I would
recommend if you're going to do any
serious overclocking on this board which
I hope you're doing if you're buying
this board that you probably connect
both of them moving down this side of
the board we have an LED post readout we
have slow mode I probably leave that off
for the most part ln2 mode which is the
jumper right here
ah CPU frequency okay where's that one
lead can't even see where some of these
lead fascinating okay well here's all
the voltage check point so you can check
DRAM CD DRAM ad PCH 1.5 PCH 1.1 vtt VSA
v core and you've got two grounds
available we have on board start and
reset switches we also have the ability
to turn on or off I believe these are
all of the PCI Express here the red PCI
Express slots although I will double
check that for you guys we have the
traditional go button right here we've
got our 24-pin connector in its ideal
location along the right-hand edge front
USB 3 in what I would consider to be its
ideal location along the right-hand edge
Sub Zero sense this is fascinating so
Sub Zero sense right here allows you to
detect the board temperatures even when
you are well below zero so no matter how
cold you are in theory this will tell
you the temperatures that you need to
know we have 4 SATA 2 3 gigabit per
second and four SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second port so two of those are running
off the Intel chipset or rather for all
four of those are running off the Intel
chipset so that is ideal we also have an
active cooler on the chipset here which
is connected by heat pipe to another
active cooler and our passive heat sink
and the other passive heat sink and
finally the other passive heat sink that
I showed you guys already so it's like a
chain of heat pipes leading all the way
down here alright keeping on moving this
button switches which BIOS you're using
so this is a multi BIOS board if you do
happen to corrupt your BIOS you can
switch to the other one there's your
front panel connectors another front USB
three and one two USB to front panel
headers finally moving over here there's
your two BIOS chips there is your front
panel audio and how many four pin PWM
connectors do we have on this board we
have one here just zoom out far so that
they can kind of see where there's one
here one here that's two three four five
six seven eight
4-pin pwm connectors that's that's
outstanding
awesome love to see it more of those is
always better in my mind so here let's
have a look at the PCI Express slot
layout so it is ideally laid out for
four-way SLI or four-way cross fire in
an ATX or civil semi ATX form factor
remember excel ATX boards are about this
much longer
but Asus wants you to be actually be
able to install this board in any number
of different cases so what you will need
to do four-way SLI or crossfire is you
will need a case like the 800 D from
Corsair that has maybe seven expansion
spots but at least like out some extra
space at the bottom so that the bottom
card can hang over a little bit so you
can install if you're running two-way
SLI or crossfire you will be able to
install those two cards plus an
additional one to three PCIe 16x slots
of which they are all wired at 8 X
remember X 79 is 16 X 16 X or it is 16 X
8 X 8 X or it is 8 X 8 X 8 X 8 X in the
way that the PCI Express slots are going
to be split up here we have a couple of
auxiliary power connectors here's a 6
pin as well as a four pin floppy
auxiliary power connector and let's move
around to the back panel of the board
before we start to go over some of the
features that I haven't necessarily
quite covered yet so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 USB
2.0 ports a ps2 keyboard mouse combo
port clear CMOS button there's also
another one here if for whatever reason
the back panel is not convenient enough
for you we also have an ROG connect
button so that's this port right here
you use that to do overclocking on
another computer connected to this one
there is Bluetooth and which also allows
you to do overclocking but that's via
your iPad or I phone or I guess iPod
touch would probably also support it so
you can use the app to do that we've got
an eSATA port here another eSATA port
there gigabit ethernet 4 USB 3.0 7.1
audio out including optical audio out so
let's see if there's any features here
that I have sort of missed there are
some LEDs built into this board that are
going to remind you about your voltages
or just I guess warn you about your
voltage is more like it and write this
one ha OC key so OC key
is actually just a straight DVI
pass-through so you see this and this
and then you have to connect it via USB
whether you do it this way or with the
internal style connector so you can see
this right here okay
and what OSI key does is it overlays
your bio settings on top of the image
that your video card is already
outputting so what that means is you can
actually see rather than just relying on
this guy right here the little post post
readout you can actually see status
updates about your PC you can change
settings without even interfering with
whatever you're doing on the screen
behind the overlay so it's kind of like
if you have a home theater and you have
a receiver that has an overlay to change
whatever settings that at the hardware
level but it doesn't actually affect the
media that's playing back in the
background and then you can just you
know shut it off at will so that is the
OSI key I think that's pretty cool let
me see if there's anything that I've
kind of missed where so this is hardware
driven so you can tweak your system on
the fly and the OSD monitor right okay I
already talked to you guys so this
allows you to monitor whatever
information you want as well talked
about digi+ to which means that you've
got okay hold on let's see if I missed
anything so Japan made 10k black
metallic capacitors these are rated for
a hundred and five degrees and asu's
figures they'll last up to five times
longer than regular solid caps these
guys down here with all the cooling all
over them VGA hot wire oh I can't leave
I missed this one right here so vga hot
wire is these headers right here this
allows you to actually over volt you're
over volt your GPUs through the Asus
utility rather than connecting variable
resistors to the back of the board and
adjusting the little dials so you
soldered you have to do all the same
solder points you still have to do the
work it doesn't support just like
overall ting your GPU through the PCI
Express slot or anything like that but
what it does allow you to do is it
allows you to adjust those
settings using the motherboard so that
is very very cool what else do we have
here for waking and I think that pretty
much covers it nope there's one more
thing
so USB BIOS flashback without even a CPU
or Ram installed in the system you throw
a USB key in there you rename the file
to the correct name you check the manual
to make sure you've got it all setup
right you can actually flash the BIOS in
the worst case scenario which is
everything went as wrong as it can go
and you can completely restore it to a
new biome
couple more cool features sorry battery
died is you can actually see the status
of any cards that are installed in the
PCI Express slots in the BIOS this isn't
a new feature on this board but it is
one that I have seen on previous AC
sports like the crosshair 5 that is very
useful for diagnosing video card
problems especially if you have water
cooling blocks on there and I think that
pretty much covers it thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the rampage
