virally about how unboxings are stupid I
will do as he requested I'm just going
to do away with the box on this one very
quickly here's the unboxing component of
today's video there it's gone I'm not
going to talk about the matching
connector or the matching I don't know
whatever they're called packing
materials okay we're just gonna it's
gonna take off this plastic without any
ceremony whatsoever there you go here
you happy was that better is that a
better video done just kidding guys I'm
not done already
okay so this is the cloud steward by
Pogoplug this is a buffalo external hard
drive product alright the things that it
comes with our a flat Ethernet cable
which is very nice looking you know
usually see products like this come with
a nice high quality internet cable like
that it's terrific alright we've also
got an AC to DC power adapter so it's a
12 volt 4 amp power adapter a plug looks
a little something like that ok and we
have a wall plug that plugs into the
power adapter this it goes in this way
or it goes in this way your choice
innovative ok
no I'm just kidding that's not the part
of this that's innovative so you can
access and share anytime &amp;amp; anywhere so
you have secure accessible storage
remote access from anywhere easy secure
sharing and no service contracts or fees
now that part is cool this is a one
terabyte product it's the tube a single
hard drive so what that means is that
buffalo has innovatively found a way to
make their device have a single hard
drive take up two bays
no I'm just kidding that's not how it
works what actually happens is you take
off the front here and you can install
an additional drive into the cloud store
if you'd like so I'm just going to show
you guys the procedure for removing the
drive that is pre-installed you just do
that and then you can pull out the drive
so inside we have a Seagate Barracuda
7200 point 12 one terabyte drive and we
can go ahead
put it back in should be some desire
just like that so now it's clipped in
not gonna go anywhere so you just use
the leek to pull it out from the back so
you can actually see the mechanism here
that pulls it out and just pull this
down so that it'll come out all right so
let's go ahead and throw the front back
on there we are okay so we have power
function as well as info / error LEDs on
the front of the unit although there's
no power switch on the front of the unit
because innovatively buffalo has located
that on the back we have our power in a
Kensington lock we've also got our
Ethernet port we have auto on and off
for our power switch as well as one USB
port and a function button let's see
what else buffalo has to say for
themselves on the cloud store box so
there's your home network so that means
you can take apparently music documents
videos and whatever that is old pictures
and you can stream them to your home
computer to a mobile device such as an
iPad and then from there you can go to
the internet which is the cloud aspect
of this particular device and you can
access your data with a mobile device
such as a smartphone like the Apple
iPhone Android or Blackberry and palm
wow so they've got full support for all
those different platforms oh that's
really cool and then a PC or a Mac so
whether that's a laptop or a desktop
whatever the case may be if you have
network access you will be able to get
your files so here they actually show
the software so here's Austin evidently
so there's bunch of photos here these
are Brian's photos from Europe and
you've got a bunch of different things
here actually we should have a look at
the software and a couple minutes here
so you can freely access share and you
can share your photo slideshows videos
and music and much more with anyone
anywhere through the cloud you know
contract set up the clouds for in second
so we're gonna test that how long it
actually takes to do that adding
capacity is a snap by inserting a second
hard drive so I actually don't see
anything in here about rate so it looks
like all you get to do by adding an
additional drive is just increase the
capacity got an intuitive web interface
set up the cloud store as a drive letter
or a device on your PC you're using
experience remains the same whether you
are at home or away supports BitTorrent
you
and apparently Facebook and Twitter so
it's kind of neat what else is here well
that is a Gigabit Ethernet port so the
speed of this device should be pretty
decent and it does support raid 1 or
j-bot so j-pod means that you're just
increasing the capacity raid Mach 1
means you can throw in two identical
drives and you can have the mirrored for
additional data security so thank you
