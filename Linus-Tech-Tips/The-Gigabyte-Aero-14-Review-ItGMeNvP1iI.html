released the new razor blade with better
hardware and identical build quality to
its predecessor it was the massive price
drop that got me and a lot of others
excited about it but apparently gigabyte
doesn't think they went low enough
gigabyte figures they can do the same
thing for six hundred US dollars cheaper
for a 512 gig model Wow and this is it
the arrow 14 or as I'm calling it the
poor man's blade
mass drop is currently featuring their
exclusive k7 XX red headphones built by
AKG learn more and buy one today at the
link in the video description let's
start with specs it would be easy to put
a core i5 with onboard graphics in this
thing and say hey look it's cheaper so
you can't call something a blade
competitor unless it's similarly
equipped so like the blade 14 my config
of the arrow 14 more on that later rocks
a core i7 6700 HQ 16 gigs of DDR for
memory and m2 SSD and a gtx 970m
graphics card though it has three gigs
versus six gigs of VRAM which leads us
pretty well into the differences because
while raw system performance should be
pretty darn close in some ways in others
the experience will be pretty different
for starters the SSD in my config is
SATA instead of nvme in spite of the
product pages PCIe messaging right at
the top onto the power brick in spite of
its slightly lower rated output it's a
touch bigger but it includes a 2.1 amp
USB port which is a super convenient
feature for regular travelers
next is i/o where it's hard to declare a
true winner the arrow 14 rocks 3 USB 3
five gigabit type-a ports just like the
blade adds a USB 3.1 10 gigabit port on
its type-c port but it sacrifices
thunderbolt on that same type-c
connector and then it gets more
complicated they both have HDMI but the
arrow 14 has hdmi 2.0 for 60 Hertz 4k
output and a mini DisplayPort for easy
conversion to anything including VGA
making up for some of the functionality
lost by that funderbolt port that's
missing and then finally and if this
isn't a homerun it's a ground-rule
double for sure the arrow 14 has an SD
card reader
woohoo moving on to the display the air
14 has
Gigabyte very optimistically refers to
as a freak a 14 inch IPS display with an
actual resolution of 2560 by 1440 which
I've usually heard referred to as 1440p
or two and a half K which is only about
64% the number of pixels as the blade
14s 3 K + display but deceptive product
marketing aside I think this is a great
move at this size it doesn't appreciable
effect the sharpness of text or other
on-screen elements and it contributes
directly to better battery life and
longer battery life when gaming at the
panel's native resolution it's not as
bright as razors display and the huge
chin bar reminds me of notebooks from
years past but it's got DC backlight
modulation that's why it's not
flickering in our b-roll and a matte
finish with strong contrast performance
that makes it look really good in person
I did miss the touch screen quite a few
times and gsync or higher refresh rates
would be on the wish list for an arrow -
but these features would add cost and
device thickness so overall I'm not
complaining here on the subject of
thickness whatever gigabyte might think
about this the blade 14 continues to be
the obvious competitor here and while
you could convince me that the arrow 14
is the same size if it had been a couple
of weeks since I'd seen a blade
side-by-side the difference is
noticeable the arrow 14 is about 15
percent larger by volume most of which
is due to its increased thickness but
once again this is a matter of
trade-offs rather than an opportunity
for me to declare a clear winner for
your extra thickness you get socketed
memory slots two of them allowing the
arrow 14 to be upgraded to 32 gigs of
off-the-shelf Ram this a pacer stuff
that I had lying around from an ad spot
a while ago worked great making it a
shockingly well equipped workstation
competitor you get a second
ndot to slot for an additional storage
drive with raid support by the way and
you get a whopping 90 plus watt hour
battery that translated into a huge
real-world battery life advantage at the
same screen and keyboard backlight
brightness speaking of the keyboard
gigabyte also makes a point of
mentioning the super long key travel in
their marketing materials but frankly I
don't think it contributed anything here
I mean the good news is that it didn't
hurt the experience either the force
required to type is a little bit heavy
for my tastes but I did get used to it
in a few days and at this point I feel
like the keyboard with the
well-positioned macro keys contributing
significantly here is a strong point for
this device in spite of its
monochromatic backlighting and missing
write function key that makes one-handed
volume adjustments a bit more of a chore
as for the touchpad it's not the best
I've ever used but I've been using this
thing daily for over two weeks now and
it's yet to make me upset so very good
marks for both of these onto overall
build quality the one-finger 180 plus
degree hinge is really nice the speakers
are very loud and very clear but sound
like they're coming from somewhere else
due to their position on the bottom of
the device the built-in webcam isn't
anything special and there's more
chassis flex than premium products like
Dells XPS 15 Apple's MacBook line and
yes that comparison again the blade 14
but nowhere near the gigabyte notebooks
of old that I refused to review because
I could bend them into a boomerang shape
with minimal effort and you are saving a
few bucks here so I don't mind making
some concessions when it comes to
overall robustness but what about
performance then Linus well as long as
it doesn't thermal throttle this
hardware combo shouldn't shock us so the
only real difference here comes into
play if you insist on playing at native
resolution so make of that then what you
will on the subject of thermals its
trade-off time again the Aero 14 manages
to be quieter than the blade 14 under
low
and I'm thinking this is in no small
part due to its much less restrictive
exhaust vent under the screen but it
suffers from noticeably higher keyboard
and touchpad temperatures at idle then
while gaming its touchpad is actually
four degrees cooler but its keyboard
which you're more likely to be touching
while you're gaming because you'll
probably be using an outside mouse is
four degrees hotter add to that though
that the components inside the blade 14
generally run hotter and it becomes a
question of personal preference at least
if you have enough to afford either one
which leads us then into the conclusion
I don't like some of gigabyte sketchy
claims 3k display all those call-outs
for m2 nvme raid when my config the only
one available in the States at the
moment has a single 512 gigabyte or
drive and I don't understand why they
felt the need to behave this way because
there's no need to stretch the truth for
the arrow 14 to be a fantastic machine
it does that on its own it gives up some
build quality it gives up a touchscreen
and an RGB backlit keyboard and
Thunderbolt and it is a little bit
bigger than the blade 14 but it offers
up significantly better battery life
hdmi 2.0 an SD card reader more flexible
configurations so I talked about my
config I'd expect to see more in the
future thanks to two slotted memory and
m2 bays a two-year global warranty and a
much lower price and it does all that
while including a USB to Ethernet dongle
for folks who prefer wires to killer
networking wasn't that fun you know what
else is fun saving money on your phone
bill do you ever find yourself going t
why is it that I when I go to the
restaurant I have to order you know six
cheeseburgers for the week and then if I
don't use four of those cheeseburgers I
just have to throw them in the garbage I
only ate two of them why can't I just
buy two well that is how mobile phone
bills work you have to say in advance
like oh I'm probably going to talk to
you know people for 227 minutes this
month but then if you only use 226 you
paid for something you
News well not with ting with ting you
pay for only what you use in the average
ting bill is only 24 bucks a month per
device just head over to Linus ENCOM
we've got it linked in the video
description and try out their savings
calculator you enter your last couple of
bills and then it spits out hey here's
how much you would be saving on ting and
boom you can see if you'd be a happy
person and by the way data is now just
ten bucks per gig beyond the first
gigabyte mmm pretty freakin cool so sign
up and you'll get 25 bucks in service
credit or towards a new device Wow
so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it was awesome get subscribed hit the
