graphics card reviews the 980
hall-of-fame edition from galaxy
galaxies or Galax the apparently Galax
now for whatever reason has made a bit
of a splash for being very fast out of
the box and having a beautiful all-white
design including their PCB also for
those of you that were enjoying the
Affordable Month award showdown video
never fear
I'll be working on the next episode very
soon cooler masters casemod World Series
is your opportunity to show off your
modding skills and win great prizes
entries close February 7th 2015 click
now to learn more to begin we have to
take a look at the heart of this card
its performance Hardware Galax sets you
up with a stock based clock speed of the
2048 CUDA core equipped GM 204 chip of
1304 megahertz and a boost clock speed
of a whopping 14 18 megahertz which is
an impressive 202 megahertz over the
reference 980 the card standard set up a
4 gigabytes of 256 gigabit ddr5 memory
is nudged up a little bit understandably
much less exciting 10 megahertz
resulting in an effective 7000 10
megahertz compared to the reference
cards 7000 vegard's
the job of cooling all this performance
is given to 280 millimeter fans and 190
millimeter fan on top of a 7
nickel-plated heat pipe aluminum Finnair
a three of the heat pipes are 6
millimeter and four of them are eight
millimeter girth show-offs hiding a way
back here is also a integrated mosfet
heatsink that galaxy put in as well and
last but not least there is an
absolutely beautiful anodized aluminum
backplate which admittedly doesn't do a
whole lot for performance but really
ties the whole card together
aesthetically and does offer structural
support to help the card not Bend under
the weight of that heatsink this cooling
setup kept the card at a relatively cool
73 degrees ish while overclocked and
under heavy load on our open test bench
and we don't have an acoustic chamber
but I also wouldn't say that it was
unnecessarily loud even in our most
stressful tests now I'm going to take a
moment
before moving on to essentially buy some
time while you guys get a look at this
card and appreciate what Galax has done
here aesthetically again with the latest
editions of their Hall of Fame series
there's lots of sweet tech inside
including classics like SLI CUDA GeForce
experience and all the new stuff that
was introduced with GTX 980 like mfa a
dynamic super resolution and delta color
compression which you can learn more
about in Linus's original 980 launch
video by clicking it now back to the
aesthetic the only drawback I see here
is the slightly beige color of the
otherwise great dual eight pin power
connectors that lead to the buff eight
phase power design with eight phases for
GPU and two from memory moving on the
galaxy sticks with reference I owe
configuration with three full-sized
display ports one HDMI and lastly one
DVI port and also back here you may
notice these at first seemingly random
button near the i/o
well it isn't labeled and I couldn't
easily find anything about it in their
manual as they use a reference card for
their examples I was able to eventually
identify it as the hyper boost button
which essentially increases fan speed
and maximum power delivered to the GPU
just by pressing it in if you've decided
that you just have far too many famous
things and you simply need multiple
halls of fame in your computer the SLI
fingers at the top of the card will
happily accommodate to three or even
four GPUs all linked together also at
the top of the card there is a large
backlit hall-of-fame logo whose
brightness and lighting pattern can be
controlled through software and finally
we have one last little switch on the
far end of the card which is you guessed
it a dual BIOS switch which should
enable you to try out new firmware
updates and customize things relatively
risk-free as we have done a whack ton of
general overview style reviews on the
GTX 980 already I decided to go with a
slightly different route for the
benchmarking on this one and went for a
4k gaming shootout between our EVGA
classified 980 our Galax hall-of-fame
980 and our sapphire vapor-x 290x eight
gigabyte cards well for clocking was
simple enough thanks to this card coming
with
such an aggressive stock clock you won't
actually have to push it all that hard
to get a very respectable overclock my
personal settings were Mac's core
voltage and power limit combined with a
core clock increase of 90 megahertz and
a memory clock increase of 300 megahertz
which resulted in an effective in-game
core clock speed of 15 33 megahertz well
this isn't quite as high as our EVGA
classified 980 s overclock of 1570
megahertz
it is important to remember that some of
this could easily be attributed to the
silicon lottery because not all chips
are created equal as with all of our GPU
reviews we're using our standard test
bench the specs of which you can see on
the screen you're looking at right now
and all of the graphics cards used for
this test are overclocked and you can
find them and all of my settings for
them linked in the description down
below as long as Nick gets his crap
together and includes a link for a
change otherwise you can find it on the
forum with the fun performance stuff out
of the way let's get to the only
question left which is what's in the box
the answer may shock you a quick
installation guide a user's manual - 8
pin PCI power adapters 1 DVI to VGA
converter and finally clearly the most
important inclusion is a do not disturb
door knob hanger
alright guys speaking of aesthetically
beautiful things today's sponsor is

guys in the comments down below do you
want Linus to make it fast as possible
episode
what the heck the silicon lottery is let
me know while you're down there like
dislike favorite share subscribe if you
haven't already all of those things if
you want to jump off of YouTube because
you want some other website go to Linus
tech tips calm
that's the forum if you don't like the
ads you can become the contributor get
rid of all those you can comment on the
thread under Linus's ramblings for this
video and I'm probably more likely to
see your comment there also if you want
a shirt that isn't this one check out
the link in the description below the
video because you obviously went back to
YouTube for whatever reason anyways guys
thanks for watching I'll see you next
