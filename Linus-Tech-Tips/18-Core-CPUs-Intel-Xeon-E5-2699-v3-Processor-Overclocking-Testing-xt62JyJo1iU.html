like much but if you've ever gotten a
review sample from Intel then you'll
know that there could be anything inside
usually a CPU but anyway this my friends
is one of our two Intel Xeon $26.99 v3
processors now this was not easy to get
because this is not your average
run-of-the-mill consumer you know tops
out at a thousand peasant dollars
processor note this is a four thousand
five hundred dollar chip it has 18 cores
it supports hyper threading for a total
of 36 threads it has 45 megabytes of
cash it has more cash than my first
computer had Ram my first computer that
I owned for myself had ran it has more
cash than that and my server board isn't
here for it yet but I figure what the
hey this is LGA 2011 3 right just like
an X 99 motherboard the next 99
motherboard listed as compatible so I
figured why don't we take her for a spin
even though we can't fire up both of
them and I'm going to put it in a soos
x99 deluxe and find out what this little
puppy is capable of so come along for
the ride
the ring video doorbell lets you see
who's at the door and really now you're
going to open the door
okay well whatever I could have
prevented him from doing that by locking
my door and then going and seeing the
video on my phone to see if I should let
that guy in alright so the first step is
to take that wussy core i7 59 60 x8 core
processor out of my test bench now the
first thing that stands out to me
immediately about these suckers is the
fact that even though they go in the
same socket you can actually see that
the Xeon chip with my hands are shaky
I'm super stoked on this as you can see
that the Xeon chip is significantly
wider and it will actually overhang the
socket a little bit compared to what the
core i7 chip did now this is for a very
good reason because each of those
physical cores in the die down there is
the same size as the eight that go in
here but there's 18 of them 18 cores so
they're going to be spread out quite a
bit more under the integrated heat
spreader the metal piece on top now one
of the cool things about these Zeon's is
that you know you might go 18 cores holy
cow oh we better put some new thermal
compound on there 18 cores holy cow how
you know are they going to cool that
sucker well because they have so many
lower powered cores running at a lower
voltage and because the power density is
so much lower they're actually
significantly easier to cool and they
will it will in theory run cooler than
our fewer high powered course so I am
really stoked to see how our single
120-millimeter water cooler fares with
this bad boy
okay now Zeon's aren't really meant to
be used with gaming memories so we
actually had Kingston for the the dual
processor server that we're building
with this thing right
we had Kingston provide 128 gigs so
that's 8 8 by 16 gig sticks of ECC
ddr4 2133 so we're going to go ahead and
we're going to pull our gaming memory
out but I'm not a hundred percent sure
if this board even supports ECC so good
okay moment of truth times see if she
boots oh this is peridot
I'll boss oh here we go
that took a really long time
there it is new CPU installed 64 gigs of
RAM Lee 526 99 v3 at 2.3 gigahertz so uh
yeah I guess all that's left now is boot
into Windows check that out CPU core
voltage 0.78 4 volts next to nothing
you're gonna miss the moment it's
installing drivers software uh that's
just USB devices ok I guess the CPU
works already fine then no maybe those
holy crap have you ever seen 18 threads
and or excuse me 18 cores an 18 hyper
threaded virtual course in one place at
one time
that is fantastic there's our 45 Meg's a
level 3 cache
there's our 18 by 256 cubic Wow this
thing has multiple megabytes so four and
a half Meg's of level two cache
nevermind the level three cache memory
is running in quad-channel now something
I'm curious about is beyond obviously
this chip is not designed for gaming
strictly speaking but I wonder will it
support the regular unbuffered memory
let's uh let's take a run at it shall we
so since we're playing around anyway
we're going to boot er up with our quad
channel kit of Corsair Vengeance memory
and I'm just going to see if like XMP
memory works because I can't imagine why
it would but I also can't necessarily
think of a reason why not I mean we
didn't tell
a feature off on the $4,500 processor up
it boots and if we go to Advanced Mode
XMP is an option oh I don't think that's
going to work though I don't know let's
let's see ah yeah you know what
okay I'm gonna let it try I don't think
this is going to work though the way XMP
works on the consumer grade chips is
it'll actually run the CPU strap at 125
megahertz and then is actually going to
run the base clock slightly out of spec
and I really don't think the Xeon is
gonna like that this boots I'll be
floored I don't think it is so it's in a
loop right now it's not happy time to
clear CMOS and restart well let's do
2666 since that is a little bit of a of
a safer number oh not happy let's go for
default settings and that's it okay so
now that I'm booted up I know the max
turbo frequency for this chip is 3.5
gigahertz and a single-threaded workload
which means in theory you actually could
game on the thing and there would be no
disadvantage compared to running on a
consumer chip but what I don't know is
that in spite of its 2.3 gigahertz base
clock what it will run at under a
sustained all core load so there are two
things I want to know I want to know
what voltage it actually runs that when
we're loading it and I want to know what
frequency it actually runs out so you
can see turbo boost and speed step
jumping around changing frequencies here
so let's start our i-264 stability test
and then just for fun you a hundred
percent usage of 18 cores and 36 threads
so it looks like we're gonna get a
multiplier of 24
not bad so it's a little bit higher not
much higher it manages to turbo-boost
another you know hundred megahertz but
that's better than nothing and the core
voltage stays extremely low so these are
super low power cores so I'm going to go
eat lunch and we'll come back and find
out what these temps in Lynette all
right so this is actually better than I
expected it's been sitting here running
for 28 minutes and our highest core is
51 52 degrees something like that
that is ridiculous so let's overclock it
now I don't think we're going to be able
to do much Zeon's straight up do not
allow you to change the multiplier
they're not consumer chips they're not
intended for that so the only thing you
can do on a Xeon is increase the base
clock speed now we already saw what
happened when we tried to run a
different strap so that's clearly not
happening we're not going to 125 base
clock so all we can really do is maybe
we can get you know five megahertz more
on the hundred megahertz stock base
clock but remember guys five megahertz
more is 5% to are to every clock speed
we run at every boost level so that
could result in a significant
performance improvement especially when
you multiply it by 18 cores that's
that's like adding almost another core
to the sit to the tip look at that 105
megahertz we are now seeing well I guess
we should we should compare apples to
apples so let's run our stress test two
point seven three gigahertz rounding up
a little bit god it's still impressive
on our 18 core processor under full load
how very interesting now obviously
something like this is going to need a
longer stress test if you're going to
deploy it in any kind of environment and
105 megahertz from my understanding is
actually pretty borderline so we're
going to use we're actually going to use
a Seuss's real bench in order to hit
this bad boy
and find out over a longer period of
time if she's stable so real bench has
two modes one of them is a stress test
mode and one is a benchmark mode so
let's go ahead and give her up to 16
gigs of RAM and start alright so real
bench I thought it was still running for
quite some time but the system actually
locked up after about 14 minutes so
we're going to dial this puppy back well
let's say 103 megahertz let's try this
again
and find out if we can get her stable
okay so now we're booted up at a hundred
and three megahertz base clock so let's
do our eight-hour stress test
again and find out if this is stable
this will still give us a three percent
improvement in frequency which will up
but come back actually oh this is not
the same kind of a workload so you guys
can see that even in a fairly
multi-threaded workload we're actually
sitting at two point eight eight
gigahertz per core Wow
so it's only in that synthetic Ida
workload that the multiplier is only
going to 24 that is really impressive so
it looks like our eight-hour run
actually did succeed which means that
we're stable for all intents and
purposes at a three percent overclock on
our Xeon so now all that's left is to
run a couple benchmarks and kind of see
how it goes from there so those of you
who are into Cinebench why don't we go
ahead and do a multi-threaded Cinebench
r15 bench
haha wow that is incredible I've watched
this run a lot of times I have never
watched it run like that holy crap so I
think is this your Z on it 2.6 gigahertz
12 core 24 thread okay so this thing is
double the performance of an X 56 50 it
is two and a half time like two points
three times the performance of a 3930k
in Cinebench something that scales
reasonably well now let's run the single
core benchmark because I want to see how
performance is actually scaling going
from 1 to 18 course this one's gonna
take a while I don't think we're going
to film the whole thing you see this is
what this is more like what it means to
Z so we mentioned this before but this
is the ring video doorbell basically
what it does is it allows you to preview
using video it's got a 720p camera on
your iOS or Android device who is coming
to your door so whoever it is that
happens to be coming up the steps and
knocking or in this case actually
ringing the bell which is of course his
cue but he totally missed it oh hi I
have a package for you Linus can it
aside and get to work
I thought this was going to be my dual
socket motherboard go go jeez anyway the
point is it can be powered with your
existing doorbell wiring or it can use
its 5200 milliamp hour internal battery
and it works over Wi-Fi it's got motion
detection and is basically just a way of
knowing who exactly it is without
actually going outside or unlocking your
door whatever else the case may be it's
available for $1.99 and for three
dollars a month you can actually archive
the footage off of it for six months so
it's $30 a year if you buy a year at a
time so head over to the link that I've
got posted below me if you want to learn
more about the ring doorbell all right
so here we go oh
viously performances a little bit lower
actually less than 18 times the
performance so you can see that what we
lose in inter core communication and
splitting up the project efficiency we
actually gain back and then a little bit
with hyper-threading so performance
looks very promising this is an
extremely fast machine but I think
that's pretty much it for today I'd love
for you guys to leave a comment and let
me know if you'd like to see any other
completely you know different kinds of
stuff with this thing I already have
some ideas I'd love to see how it
actually does in gaming workloads for
example I'd love to see if we can if we
can crack the top of some leaderboards
based on that we're using processors
that literally nobody has so yeah I
guess that's pretty much it thanks for
watching guys like the video if you
liked it dislike it if you thought it
sucked and leave a comment if your
feelings are more complicated than that
preferably in our forum which is linked
in the video description also linked in
the video description you can buy a cool
t-shirt like this one give us a monthly
contribution if you think what we're
doing is awesome and we need more CPUs
like this or even just change your
amazon bookmark to one with our
affiliate code because if you bought a
Zeon like that on Amazon with our
affiliate code that would help us a lot
like a lot so thanks again for watching
and as always don't forget to subscribe
