the wholly good episode so this is not
one of them I am checking out something
pretty insane it is the FT 76 B 7 9 to 2
and while the name is a mouthful it
definitely doesn't pull any punches
performance-wise if it's memory you're
after you can get 6 terabytes of ddr4
memory modules up in the front of the
case if you need processing power you
can get 4 e 7 8800 series has well based
processors if it's storage there's 8
slots up in the front for 2 and a half
inch bays and naturally if you wanted
nvme you could install them in the many
PCIe slots on the back or in the 2
hot-swap bays in the corner as well yes
that is hot swappable PCIe 8 X slots 2
of them in the back so when looking at
the server up in the front you have your
8 2 and a half inch base give your 96
potential slots for RAM on the modules
right behind that then you have 4 CPUs
then you have your PCIe area and then
for redundant 1200 watt power supplies
just in case you're worried about three
of them failing at once there's still
one that will hold you on and all of
those front two and a half inch bays are
rated together on an LSI card in the
back of the case which does actually
have a little bit of tie n branding on
it which is kind of cool but if stuff
like crazy hot swappable storage is more
your thing we can move on to the GT 60
to be b55 3 9 another naming mouthful
but it's fine I'm going to do something
kind of cool on camera right now which
is pull out one of their nvme drives so
this is the Intel p3 700 nvme drive just
pull it out while we were running the
little green light goes off I can take
it put it back in click it in wait for
it and while I'm talking and a couple
seconds the green light will go back on
you can just do that it's kind of cool
on the front the yellow slots are for
nvme drives the blue stock slots are for
standard older two-and-a-half inch
drives like really fast SSDs that aren't
nvme or hard drives whatever you want in
terms of processor this thing is running
a xeon d 1541 that's an SOC chip it's an
8 core chip that means it doesn't have
like a normal socket that you could drop
and remove a processor from it's
actually soldered directly onto the
board but if you do want a slightly
higher in
you can get a 16 core model as well and
if you're still not satisfied with your
hot swappable nvme drives you can add on
the tn7 tje 3250 which has 12 three and
a half inch hard drive bays and can link
into the guy above it so you can expand
your storage dramatically that way so
that was pretty freakin cool I think
Linus has some more servers to Drew
laughter we're going to go check out
more stuff at combi Tex thanks to Thai n
for bringing us here and sponsoring us
for Computex 2016 if you want to see the
rest of our Computex content be sure to
subscribe to Linus tech tips and if
you're interested in the other stuff ty
n might do like all the boards and
whatnot that are behind me check out
their website because they do a lot of
cloud computing HP see all that kind of
stuff as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
