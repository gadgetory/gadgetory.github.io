the first true wireless earbuds on the
market true Wireless meaning that
they're not even physically connected to
each other by a wire and we actually
loved them when they came out in fact I
think it's fair to say that in spite of
the tidal wave of wireless earbuds that
have hit the market in the last couple
of years
they still hold up pretty well and
according to Apple at least their
customers agree because they are still
the most popular wireless earbuds on the
market so with all of that in mind I am
even more ready than I was last time to
be blown away by the latest greatest
expensiveness thing from Apple
hit me with dem ear pods to baby this is
like this is the same how am I going to
show everybody how loaded I am oh yeah I
guess that's an option like ear pods
edition pebble host is a transparent
game and web hosting company focused on
balancing price with performance game
server started just $1 per gig for RAM
and web hosting starts at just two
dollars a month check them out today and
use code LTT to save 20%
ah yes my friends you heard it here
first or on Marquez's channel and that
guy's fast whatever it doesn't matter so
the air pods - which is not their actual
name they're just new air pods look
exactly the same as the first generation
air pods which for once I can kinda get
behind to be honest this new version is
an extremely incremental upgrade over
the original with only a few small
changes under the hood and in fact the
only real game-changing upgrade is an
optional accessory a wireless charging
case which will really come in handy
soon when Apple launches their hotly
anticipated air power charging down so
we'll look a little closer at the case
later for now the new air pods have the
same size battery same five-hour battery
life for listening to audio the same
programmable double tap gesture and the
same respectable if unexceptional audio
quality on the inside however they're
powered by Apple's new h1 chip rather
than the W one in the old model and this
brings us a few key improvements battery
life for calls has increased from two to
three hours on a single charge switching
between devices is faster by a second or
two you can say hey Siri now instead of
mapping it to a double tap gesture and
finally audio latency has apparently
been reduced by 30% though frankly it
wasn't really that noticeable in our
testing so if you love the original air
pods you're gonna love these to grab
your hard-earned money or better yet
your Apple branded titanium credit card
and go buy a pair
but there is actually a problem here a
lot of people didn't love the original
and Apple has done absolutely nothing to
help them out here's the thing human
ears are actually really really
different from each other and some
people just can not get ear pods to stay
in place now fortunately the majority of
expensive earphones use a
well-established industry standard
solution to this problem
they provide a selection of flexible ear
tips in a variety of sizes so that you
can choose the one or ones uh people are
not entirely symmetrical you know that
best fit their ears some ear buds also
have some sort of adjustable mechanism
for securing them in place like the
Google pixel buds and this is more
important than you might think because a
good seal with your ear canal not only
keeps you from dropping your left pod
down a storm drain and ruining your day
but it also has a profound impact on the
listening experience this is part of the
reason that you might see wildly varying
reports of the audio quality of the air
pods so if you're one of the chosen few
with small symmetrical years
congratulations
you get to enjoy the air pods and the
new air pods but if you've got bigger
ears or even worse if you have one year
that fits them great and when that
doesn't like Riley who wrote this
episode then one will fall out if you
run while wearing them and all you'll be
left with is a single air pod as a
reminder of how much of a weird
asymmetrical fruit
so yeah with so many solutions to this
problem already on the market it is a
little disappointing to see Apple change
nothing about the way that our pods sit
in your ear
knowing them I'm sure they could have
engineered a marvelous spectacular
magical slightly more grippy material
for the pod itself or included optional
ear hook accessories in the box
but no now you can buy third-party
attachments for cheap on Amazon but
those won't fit inside your charging
case making them yet another thing to
lose all the time and even worse kind of
make your real ear pods look like a
cheap knockoff kind of defeats the whole
point of buying air Potts done it more
irritating to me I mean they fit find
admirers is that they also didn't add
any new gestures well you can still
customize double taps on the right and
left ear pods to activate Siri play and
pause or skip tracks telling Siri to
change the volume is still the only way
to do that without touching your phone I
mean you can tell Siri to turn it way
down or way up but it's still an
uncharacteristically janky solution hey
Siri turned the volume having Siri
always listening is nice by the way but
the issue with Siri is that she's Siri
and even with Cortana quite literally
dead in the water I'm still not sure if
she's on the podium for a top digital
assistance I do have some good news for
Android users though no thanks to Apple
compared to when I originally reviewed
the original air pods you can now use a
third-party app assistant trigger to
summon the Google assistant by double
tapping an air pod unfortunately that's
really the only good news for the
Android lovers yes you can still use air
plods too with an Android device but in
our testing we experienced multiple
glitches including the double tap
gestures not working and this
particularly annoying phenomenon
vulva music volume getting blasted up to
full power when playing the next track
now that last one is apparently fixed in
the latest firmware which is great
except for one thing
there's no manual way to update it
apple's instructions to update your
firmware are quite literally place them
near an apple device they've been paired
to and wait well we did wait for hours
and nothing happened so for Android
users with no other Apple devices
obviously this just looks like yet
another fun little way for Apple to say
oh really I'm sore you're too poor for
an iPhone bummer all right then enough
about the air pods what about that cool
new wireless charging case there are
some actual small changes to the
physical design here the LED indicator
has moved from inside the case to the
front the pairing button on the back has
moved up a bit and the hinge now has a
matte finish instead of a mirrored one
okay I mean I did say there were small
changes right anyway the case holds 19
hours of battery life which in addition
to the five hours of music listening in
the air pods will net you a maximum of
24 hours of battery life total you can
get three hours of listening time from
just 15 minutes in the case and the case
which is $40 when bundled with the air
pods - or 80 dollars as an upgrade for
your old ones will charge at five watts
on any cheap compatible charging pad
what's also nice is that at the expense
of them being a little bit heavier to be
clear it's not a lot they still managed
to squeeze a lightning jack in the
bottom so you can use a wire if you want
enjoy that while it lasts by the way
because we all see the direction Apple's
going with our precious wires
Silvan with the air pods - we find
ourselves in a very similar situation to
the one we were in right before they
came out for Android users they're
flawed and expensive but one of the only
options for earphones that don't
penetrate your ear canal as for the
athleisure z' well they're still a great
option and you'll probably get your
money's worth as long as you don't lose
them
I do have to say though I hope that
Apple makes some bigger changes for the
air plots 3 or I feel like they're gonna
be left behind by the rest of the
wireless earbuds are kit which is
