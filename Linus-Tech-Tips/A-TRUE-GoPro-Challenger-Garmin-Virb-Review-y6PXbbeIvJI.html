review with me cool ok Garmin start
recording that's pretty cool cooler
masters master case maker five features
they're freeform modular system allowing
you to customize adjust
and upgrade make it yours at the link
below one of my biggest problems with
the GoPro Hero 4 line and below in the
ocean of GoPro knockoffs has always been
the usability often their best mounting
places are unconvenient to get to or in
a place where you can't monitor them
easily like the top of your helmet
making it so that you can't really tell
if the thing is actually recording or
not without firing up the app on your
phone which is inconvenient for its own
reasons and your only real option in
many cases is to have it record the
entire event where you risk your battery
dying and your SD card filling up huh
now in filmmaking or video creation in
general arguably the most important
thing is getting the shot a big
proponent of this over the last few
years has been the venerable casey
neistat he has said many times that gear
doesn't matter story matters and to get
the story you need to get the shot so
with that in mind let's start with the
verbs new accessibility features they
are in no particular order
ok Garmin start recording ok Garmin
remember that ok Garmin stop recording
ok Garmin take a picture start and stop
recording and take a picture all rather
self-explanatory what remember that does
is when you go to edit your video there
will be tags throughout your footage of
where you told it to remember something
so what you could do is just wah ok
Garmin remember that all you have to say
is remember that and then when you
finally get to edit that footage later
on you don't have to scrub through
everything you filmed which could be a
huge benefit when you've got a lot of
footage also of note is that being able
to start and stop recording with just my
voice
ended up being a huge battery saver over
time computing the theme of usability we
have a legitimately astonishing
touchscreen no really it works through
the water-resistant case not while it's
underwater
mind you and the screen isn't nearly as
responsive or accurate when used in this
manner but despite my complaints I did
end up using it even if it was often in
combination with the hardware buttons
it also features live streaming when
paired with an iPhone automatic multi
camera sync if you're doing a more
complicated shoot Bluetooth audio and
ANT+ in order to connect additional
sensors like heart rate sensors on top
of the high sensitivity GPS
accelerometer gyroscope altimeter and
compass suite that they're calling G
metrics and that serves as proof that
you went that high road that fast etc
very cool which is all fine and good as
long as it doesn't look or sound like
but but I'm going to pass things off to
our in-house camera expert brandon lee
to take a look at that jumping into
image quality the verb is surprisingly
solid in this department the verbs image
is quite comparable to the gopro hero4
black rendering similar detail in the
recording the addition of the image
stabilization is a nice touch and will
come in handy in certain shooting
situations but it is by no means a
substitute for a proper stabilizer that
can be used with action cameras like
this like GoPro Garmin has decided to
include a flat profile in the verb when
you want to capture a wider dynamic
range however when using the vivid
profile setting on the verb Garmin has
done a good job on not making an image
feel over saturated or processed in
camera something that I've seen action
cameras do in the past
overall the image in the verb stands up
to the competition in this space but
with the recent release of the GoPro
Hero 5 that might not be the case for
much longer
Thank You Brandon and the accessories
Department Garmin has quite a number of
options for you to scoop up but if
you're drowning in GoPro mounts already
never fear the mounting mechanism was
shamelessly ripped off of GoPro and
therefore can be used interchangeably so
conclusion time it's interesting but is
it worth it I'm going to give the ever
annoying answer of maybe calm
my conclusion is the extremely recent
announcement of GoPros Hero 5 lineup
which features water resistance without
housing and similar voice control but
not the additional sensors so I have a
feeling I'll need to do my review of
that before I can give a more complete
conclusion there even the same price
now that Garmin has lowered theirs by
about a hundred dollars no word yet on
whether or not early buyers will be
getting a refund let's hope that is a
true so awesome sensor data or almost
certainly better image quality of the
raw capable GoPro Hero 5 that we will
check out soon let me know in the
comments down below which you prefer but
for now ok Garmin stop recording you
know what printer's specifically the
pagewide pro mfp 477 DW it offers
best-in-class ISO speeds it's very quick
to print the first page and can print up
to 70 pages per minute on the 500 series
models with double-sided print speeds of
25 pages per minute it can do single
pass a double-sided scanning and allows
you to spend less time and budget on
scheduled maintenance with their
pagewide technology it's got front USB
that supports multiple file formats such
as Word and PowerPoint and it's
intuitive touchscreen controls allow you
to navigate on the 4.3 inch display you
can set up pins for receiving print jobs
that are confidential in the workplace
and you can print from mobile devices
with Wi-Fi direct and NFC touch to print
technology so there's no network
required to print you get four times
more prints from their extra high yield
cartridges and you can check it out at
the link in the video description thanks
for watching this video guys if it
sucked you know what to do Bru but if it
was awesome hit the like button get
subscribed all that fun stuff I can't
believe that the GoPro Hero 5s was
announced literally the day that I felt
this that is
dick ulis if you want to buy some stuff
to have an Amazon link as we description
down below or our shirts those are cool
too you can talk about these various
cameras and the ups and downs of each
one of them on the BA forum I can say
that word ball that's what we should
just call it from now on the line is
tech tip swallow ah
anyways guys check out this video which
is Linus's review on the Yi action
camera if you want to see more of these
things and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
