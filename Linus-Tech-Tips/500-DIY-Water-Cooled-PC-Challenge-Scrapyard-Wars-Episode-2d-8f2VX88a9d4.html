thus gravity we are headed to Andrew
share it again the plan this time is to
get some fittings probably so we can
adapter from that year Accord that I got
to the copper tubing so we can adapter
from the flexible tubing to the copper
tubing and I might pick up one of those
copper caps again just we don't waste a
trip if I decide to water cooled it's
good alright so as you sure I went well
I'm basically out of budget for water
cooling stuff but I still need that
plate so let's go see if we can figure
that out I just did some counting I have
a lot of change because that's all I
have left for water cooling budget I
have six dollars and 20 cents left I
have one more thing to buy and it's a
copper plate I'm hoping I'll just give
it to me because I bought half a pound
and they only gave me 0.125 which is
fine because that's all I needed
but so if I get a different dude this
time it's like no you have to buy the
minimum quantity then it would be twice
that price and then I super definitely
can't afford it it's technically a to
priority but I think I need to mod the
case because if I don't do that
it's going to be very difficult for me
to know how much space I have for my
copper coil because I'm sure that you
don't mind at all ah it's riveted hat
awesome a little bit bigger totally work
yeah great no no okay you don't only
change
okay awesome I was that's actually why I
brought this back in but I was it was
would have been totally fair if you
didn't on a night yeah I was going to
say he also were supposed to charge me a
full pound but I don't know
awesome thank you very much I'm gonna
get to work have a good day
damn freakin battery's dying someone
unplugged the drill battery charger
thing the battery the spare battery
wasn't fully charged I'm in pretty bad
shape there's things that I can do but I
want to get this done right now
oh that's bloody impossible it is
supposed to
I might work for the tubing I'm supposed
to be able to tighten it up and then
pull it around and cut it but this
thing's so big compared to it but I
can't rotate it while it's inside so I
have no idea how I'm supposed to do it
and because it's on a curve already if I
try to rotate it while it's inside it's
like it doesn't sit properly and then
like I can't rotate it past this angle
so I don't know I could be doing
something wrong but I probably have to
cut it with a dremel in the end anyways
then I bought that tool for nothing
luckily tools don't come out of the main
budget but I still feel really dumb
buying that tool if it's not going to
work at all it'll it'll work for the the
copper tubing but that's just brutal you
go that way please honey you're not
going to be able to take your try
through the brush off you go
mommy will be at the front go go let's
hope he doesn't text and drive anytime
soon
dremel tool my ass that that is a rotary
cutter okay well this is clearly got
absolutely no strength left after I did
that so I don't even know how much point
there is leaving it on there
where's my axe it's over thank you okay
no problem okay here we go
man I love this thing okay I'm sorry did
you say steel case construction I'm
sorry did I say anything that sounded
like idea shhhhh
probably got enough room for our copper
coils but I'm not sure if we can still
put a computer in here
you
any other case modification we do will
be relatively minor I might drill a hole
here or there but now we've done the
vast majority of the cutting that I
foresee us needing to do I ended up
leaving this in I think that should be
okay
so the plan then is reservoir here coil
all up the front of the case then maybe
if we can end here then coil here and
coil all in front of the power supply
and then end here and coil here
something down GPU I really hope we can
figure this out red/green would almost
be proud yeah that's why almost
yeah I wanted this did you break it
oh yeah darn shoot that's terrible two
places okay this is a big problem
because now we need to find something
pretty much exactly this size because
the pump has to fit in
whatever reservoir we're using so I had
already validated those two components
to work together I really didn't think
it was going to be that fragile there
was only one left one one one of these
where I bought it oh no now let's find
out just how broken it is possible the
cracks don't go all the way through this
one's pretty deep
huh is it good it's too early to say but
it's possible that we got away with one
here I came from the top that's there's
there's water here what we're looking at
is right here and even as I put stress
on it nothing comes out then this one
which I thought was actually much less
likely we might have gotten away with
one here
so while we were having lunch my
neighbor arrived at home so we are
heading over there with our raw
materials and our components that we
need to cool and hopefully we will have
some kind of a plan within the next I
don't know
hour or so for how we can turn this into
something that fits on that exciting
times now internet this is John John
this is the Internet
the Internet is already you guys you
guys are going to be blown away by this
garage it makes our workshop look less
awesome John makes a solar power digital
scoreboards right basically awesome runs
off the Sun radio control no wires slice
of dice come on guys and my buddy so
pretty much the kind of gear he has in
here is mind boggling so he like makes
all kinds of little gadget real Ike this
these coils in here all pretty much by
hand except the tools that he has that
he builds himself by hand this is why
we're here
this is CNC machine oh wow here's what
we need to design today these are our
raw materials okay and this little
doodad so first we've got our graphics
card thrown together hold that baby off
so this is pretty simple all these
911 okay you need to be covered by this
and we kind of kind of score it or
something to get them out of a heat sink
II sort of effect to it and then we got
a carve out a spot for that and I'm just
gonna stick it on there no problem so
that's pretty easy
that's your loom okay this is where
things start to get more difficult so
these two pieces combined will be our
CPU water block and they need to go
right on top of the CPU here and then we
need some kind of a we need a way to
seal it around the outside problem more
modern CPU block designs tend to use
micro channels or micro fins directly
over where the CPU die is going to sit
but because we're not using the kind of
sophisticated machinery much tighter
than that so on order yeah on much on a
much much tighter scale and very very
short but we don't have the kind of
machinery that would allow us to build
something like that so you can cut it
pretty accurately oh yeah I could do a
little tiny between this point and this
point here I could probably do 20 25
little channels okay that's not too bad
we can work on that one thing we want to
be careful of too is we don't want the
design to be too restrictive to flow
restrictive because what you're saying
yeah you were limited in terms of our
pump budget thanks to the constraints of
this project I got you so what we'd want
to do is we would probably want to bring
the whole thing down a little bit so
that it can flow freely over top if it
wants but it can also sit all right I
got you now as far as this goes we'll
just tap some holes in the corners yeah
chop and die thing and then we'll use
silicon around the side here and put it
on here now again more advanced CPU
block designs would use a rubber gasket
which is removable and replaceable but
because we don't have the time or
necessarily resources to source a custom
rubber gasket for our block we're going
to go with a more permanent solution
which isn't to say that a silicon seal
is permanent permanent you could rip it
apart
Andrea silicone it and seal it back up
it's just not quite as elegant a
solution as you know or to commercially
manufactured hold it back up a little
bit you oh you want to put in a rubber
gasket now no I can do better than that
this could cut out our gasket or using
oil does that work sure for sure for
sure are like for sure
let's see if he wants to talk to us
right now if you'd prefer to wait till
later also I need to give him his pen
back because I stole it believe about 15
minutes after you left we broke a bit
got a spare one put a cheaper bit in
this one isn't as much I'm just running
slower
sorry this ended up being a much bigger
project than it was supposed to be but
if we reduced the scope if we kill the
graphics card then that should help a
fair bit and I hope sorry about this I
just want to curl up into a ball and cry
oh oh oh
have you been doing this oh oh you were
around
oh so Linus how did it go today so it's
the end of day 2 we have abandoned our
plan to build a GPU water block we still
really don't know how to get enough
copper coiled into the case to dissipate
the heat from our CPU even so it's
probably a good thing the GPU block
isn't happening and we still haven't
even put the holes in our reservoir and
finished our cpu block we still don't
actually have a way to put our fittings
into the CPU block the good news is we
can free up some budget by returning
some things tomorrow I can return GPU
fittings for example so we need a tap
for that pipe thread which lord only
knows where we're going to find and then
yeah we're gonna have to get at it
pretty bright and early tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
