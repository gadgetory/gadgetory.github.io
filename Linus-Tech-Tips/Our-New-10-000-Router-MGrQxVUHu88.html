like for the Internet get your mind out
of the deep web today's video is about
our fancy new CNC router that I hold on
I know what you're about to say I will
admit that here at Linus tech tips our
track record for maker type projects
isn't exactly pristine but the point is
we want to get better now
we could spend years honing our craft
making mistakes learning from them and
eventually becoming masters at working
with our hands but instead of doing that
we're gonna build a robot to do all the
difficult machining for us so here it is
this is our 4 foot by 4 foot
CNC router that CNC router parts sent
over to us and we're gonna walk you guys
through how to build it and how to use
it to do really cool stuff like make
this memory Express is the go-to place
for your electronic needs and services
in Canada and they're opening a new
store in Victoria BC they're hiring for
all positions so check them out at the
link in the video description
so here we've got 13 boxes that's maybe
what like a ton worth of crap and we're
gonna have to make all of that using a
244 page document and in the end
hopefully we'll have a fully functional
CNC router oh yeah I guess we just start
now they call this the industrial
erector set
and I don't know anyone who's an
engineer definitely gets 80/20 boners so
it makes sense this must be for the
gantry that thing is huge
so once this is tightened down on there
that is not going to go anywhere at all
put in the router table together is
pretty straightforward thanks to the
excellent included instructions you just
join the extruded aluminum together
using the anchor fasteners tighten them
down and then repeat what feels like
10,000 times extruded aluminum is
actually great for machine frames
because you can create extremely strong
joints without giving up modularity so
compared to a welded steel frame if we
decided in the future that this router
wasn't quite big enough for our needs
expanding the bed is relatively simple
this table is so freakin sturdy like
holy crap I can like this thing is not
going anywhere at all I guess that's why
it's called the pro version bullcrap
precision linear rails are added to the
sides of the table to give an excellent
bearing surface then to make sure they
run smoothly we just need to add a
little bit of grease the gantry holds
the spindle and moves around above
whatever we decide we want to cut so
from here we added the stepper motors
and we were basically good to go
mechanically onto the electronics so you
guys have seen computer power supplies
before but look at this guy holy crap so
I'm just making this up because I don't
actually know what everything is but I'm
guessing that these two are power
supplies we've got a board here that's
going to be the controller that goes to
your computer and each one of these is a
stepper motor or it'll be an output to a
stepper motor so we'll connect one to
each one of those and they probably take
fairly high voltages I'm not totally
sure but this power supply right here is
for one motor only and it's good for
2200 watts that's what Wow there's not
even a whole lot in there that's crazy
that they can get all of that power in
that small of a thing Oh
oh that's heavy so this is gonna be the
real business end of the CNC that's good
for three horsepower twenty four
thousand rpm
oh okay okay hey don't don't be a
show-off I don't want you hurting
yourself cheese yeah we're gonna have to
move it too that'll be fun we're gonna
need like six seven people to do this
like comfortably this ends not so bad
but like is this all manual assembly
like every one of these plates yeah how
are their instructions really good I
guess we should really close that
yeah guys we're filming here
yeah the spindle on its own has a 2.2
kilowatt power supply what holy crap so
to put that in perspective this motor
consumes more power than even the
beefiest gaming rig including its
monitor and peripherals I'm gonna hit it
and see what happens it's alive is this
wood here because we're sacrificing it
or no okay
really this is a table I would never
have known that you had a table based on
how many of the tools for this project
ended up on the ground there's a little
light that's turning on on this okay
good I guess so the sensor is definitely
working but I don't know if it's
inputting into the Hat I was like oh
it'd be nice to see this stuff a bit big
No so it turns out that if all we wanted
to do was turn it on there was a switch
that we needed to flip but that wasn't
our biggest problem anyway so basically
what we're doing here is I was an idiot
and put the spindle and the whole gantry
assembly on the wrong way so when it
homes over here it's like a good foot
off the table so we need to pick up this
whole piece right here and flip it and
that's why we have four dudes
okay so one person just stop it from
tilting all right all right
anti-clockwise we're going this way okay
so I think me and John are going to have
to hold it and you guys will have to go
under now that everything is assembled
correctly time to fire it up so now that
it's all working let's take a look at
our finished router now I'm sure many of
you haven't seen one of these things in
operation before how the heck does it
cut things how does it get to one
thousandth of an inch of cutting
resolution basically code is sent from
the computer here and then executed by
the stepper motors which you'll find
here here here and over there so those
are the ones I alluded to earlier now a
normal DC motor will rotate continuously
when a voltage is applied more voltage
means more faster which is great if you
just want to go but it doesn't give you
any control of the position stepper
motors contain a stationary magnet
attached to the output shaft with
magnetic windings all around it so by
energizing these electromagnets the
internal magnet is attracted and aligns
with them to move the motor one step the
next set of electromagnets gets
energized moving the shaft however far
it is between electromagnets
so our stepper motors have 200
electromagnets meaning that each full
step is 1.8 degrees then that resolution
can actually be doubled with half steps
so that's where two electromagnets are
energized to have the shaft move only
half as far and then beyond that
microstepping
which relies on multiple electromagnets
at different ratios can be used to
further increase our resolution all of
that lovely precision can be
ruined though and very quickly by bad
gears so right here we have a three
point two to one gear reduction to
increase our torque from five foot
pounds to sixteen this allows us to
remove more material at a time but
anytime there's gears involved backlash
can quickly become an issue
so backlash is the slot between two
gears that causes a loss in precision
when you reverse the direction
experiencing something like this once in
a run might only result in a couple
thousandth of an inch of accuracy being
lost but on a machine that will normally
be changing direction hundreds of times
while making apart all of those little
errors would really add up so to combat
this our gears are actually preloaded
with a high stiffness spring right here
this smashes the gears together
preventing them from shifting about
willy-nilly
now of course our previous explanation
of the instructions come from the
computer wasn't exactly the best so
let's take a closer look at where those
come from because it's not quite as easy
as just hitting go like on a 3d printer
for some of our parts will use
SolidWorks and HSM Express to create the
CAD and tool paths but we will also be
using V carve Pro for other parts due to
its greater ease of use in the software
we end up having to define many
parameters like how fast the rotor will
cut for example we have to do this
because well think about if you were
using a handsaw you'd actually find
yourself adjusting how fast you move
your blade how hard you press and all
kinds of little things intuitively based
on how it feels but the thing is that
this robot isn't gonna back off if
something's amiss and it will happily
destroy a cutting tool or anything else
in its way if you don't program it
correctly that's actually one of the
reasons that they have built-in safety
Stoppers that we have to wire up before
we start doing anything so to make sure
this doesn't happen the correct rpm for
the cutter and how fast the spindle news
has to be calculated based on the force
of the cutter from there those
instructions are compiled and sent
the laptop that's connected to the
router now down here we're running
what's called Mach three which directly
interfaces with the router and runs
g-code a programming language for CNC
machines and because this is all been
preset up we should actually be able to
just hit go once we are of course fully
clear of the machine so right now what
we're doing is we're giving it a known
zero height is that correct yeah okay
cool I only know about these what my
neighbor told me during scrapyard wars
to next time it goes past and here it's
gonna be taking a bit of thau off so
just clean this up you ready I don't
think what you're doing is really
helping you might as well just get that
over there
this poor laptop well hold on hold on at
least get a shot of it if it's gonna
suffer it might as well alright go ahead
don't scrape it back over it doesn't
seem clean you go through with the big
bed yeah you get most of it done and
then you come in and do the fine details
got a smaller one beautiful so where's
our smaller bit and this is safe to just
go right in there that's considered safe
practice I want to make sure whatever
we're doing in this video is what you're
supposed to do it's pretty close okay
yeah we definitely clearly need a better
material capture solution here so is
this the last thing on your wish list
because this is one of the things you've
been trying to get me to get since what
you started
we're at the point now where we can
basically make anything out of acrylic
though
or like any plastic like our just
collect us you know Manor
okay wow it sounds heavy is it
considered safe for me to just reach in
and grab this
well you can't pick it up I can't oh
it's double-sided tape down Oh what the
crap yeah I think we need to use not
that GoPro tape because this is
ridiculous that stuff like how much did
you use you could have used just like a
tiny amount of it the world's most
spectacular you put that much on well I
could have told you that was gonna
happen yeah it broke wait no it didn't
no this is just some cleanup that we
need to do yeah you could have put like
this much times four or five and it
wouldn't have gone anywhere and that my
friends is about how this whole thing
goes down so it does take a little bit
of cleanup to get it to you know quite
this stage but surely you guys can kind
of see how we get there so we are to say
we're really excited to make some crazy
things with this would be a gross
understatement we do still have a little
bit of work to do before we can really
go hand like there's the dust collector
that is highly necessary we're gonna
attach that to the cutting head and
we're gonna be making a spoil board that
goes on the table freeze your mounting
but we're well underway and that's
pretty much it for this so huge thanks
to Nathan from CNC router parts for
sending this guy over and to rod from BS
mods for giving us some extra advice and
big thanks the events to you for the
awesome suggestions that you'll be
leaving in the comments for projects
that you guys want to see while you're
at it by the way we actually need a name
for our friend here because that joke at
the beginning of this video the router
video hahaha get it the bolt it's
actually really confusing referring to
this as the router around here so the
top upvoted name in the comments below
we're gonna cut out a sign with that
name we are gonna mount it to the
machine have fun the mast drop XA k g:k
7 XX red edition open backed headphones
feature their predecessors legendary
sound and build
which were both big hits with the
audiophile community and some additional
tweaks the highs were boosted by an
innovative flat wire voice coil the mids
were brought up to better balance the
range and the lows were raised by three
decibels for an immersive sound this
collaborative design between mass drop
and AKG includes a custom ruby red color
way to help the aesthetic really pop
from the competition as well as a
10-foot detachable cable check them out
