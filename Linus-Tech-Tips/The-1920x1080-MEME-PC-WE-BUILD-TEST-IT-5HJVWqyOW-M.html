of their lineup of risin thread Ripper
CPUs immediately our writing team knew
exactly what had to be done really guys
1920 x4 the step-down flagship I mean
that's just irresponsible so we grabbed
invidious step-down flagship GPU and set
out to build the ultimate 1920 by 1080
gaming PC wait what you don't get it
come on
even NVIDIA gets it
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description so the basis of
this entire build is a post on reddit
borrowed from a youtube comment
somewhere obviously building a full HD
gaming system out of an $800 12 core
processor a five hundred and fifty
dollar motherboard and a $500 graphics
card is stupid for a fair number of
reasons but full transparency here guys
we love stupid and the last time we
pandered to Reddit we ended up with two
and a half million views on a gaming PC
that barely worked at all so this one
was a no-brainer now it wouldn't be
Linus tech tips if the bill didn't start
with some random ass problems that we
couldn't have predicted Jake ended up
spending three hours just trying to get
our Asus zenith extreme motherboard to
post because one of the torques mounting
screws on the socket itself had loosened
as if by magic so the CPU was being
safely and securely held down just above
the damn contact pins I mean who looks
for something like that further
complicating matters that define our v
that we originally planned to build in
couldn't contain the sheer girth of this
board and thanks to our recent mezzanine
construction and organization overhaul
basically every case had been moved into
our new and improved long-term storage
area that was full of poisonous fumes
from spraying the walls so the only
cases left in the warehouse were
fractals core 3500 and the mercury s8
from seven gamers one CPU that happened
to be already set up for wider than
average dual socket server motherboards
so I think you guys can see where I'm
going with this case labs for the win
for RAM Jake made the only logical
decision here and decked out our config
with the full complement of eight times
eight gigabytes of Trident z RGB memory
from G skilled I mean come on
you think regular Ram was going to
suffice for a troll build
installing a 12 core 24 thread processor
into the tr4 socket is actually a pretty
satisfying process and once everything
was set up Jake was able to use our
Zenith Xtreme board to push our thread
Ripper 1920 X up to 4 gigahertz on all
cores at around 83 degrees Celsius under
load any higher than that and it would
crash almost instantly this could be a
limitation of just Zen core overclocking
in general but hardware info reported a
cool 240 watts of power draw for the CPU
so the limitation could also be just a
matter of the chip not being able to get
more power even with the dual 8 pin EPS
connectors this thing is crazy
to achieve that cooling result we ended
up with a course our H 100 Ivy 2 which
shockingly with its dual 120 millimeter
fans on a radiator was barely enough to
tame this beast then to give us the best
chance of success we applied an ample
amount of icy diamond thermal compound
we are going to have to ask them for
another bin of this stuff because we're
not crazy this is actually how AMD
recommends to apply it the corsair RM
1000 x is just the right amount of
overkill for modern systems so you'll
probably keep seeing that until Corsair
comes out with an RGB version or
something
and while sadly we weren't able to get
cable on cables here in time and had to
make do with the stock ones RGB was not
forgotten and thanks to the zenith dual
ARRA RGB headers and cable mod wide beam
RGB strips the entire system is RGB
synced from the RAM to the sleek
underglow Jake was so astonished by the
plethora of diseases that he contracted
from all the RGB that he almost forgot
to put in fans so at the last minute he
finished up with ek Vardar fans to match
the industrial look of our mercury s8
and huzzah it boots almost like it was
all tested before assembly so then to
answer your guys question how does the
ultimate 1920 by 1080 build perform well
the only responsible thing to do is
start our testing at 720p maximum
details
as you can see here overspending on the
CPU and skimping on the GPU is punishing
us already Deus Ex mankind divided only
managed 38 frames per second because
well maxed out like really maxed out
that's a very demanding game moving
right to the other end of the spectrum
4k gaming performance was I mean I don't
know how do I put this a poop parade
feces festival a diarrhea demonstration
you get in point it was this show so
then stepping down to 1440p there's well
there's no surprises here
4k was terrible 720p was terrible I mean
what were you expecting for something in
between like why are you even still
watching this are you are you honestly
waiting for the 1920 by 1080 results
what do you think they're gonna be like
y-you know what forget it I'm just not
even gonna show them it's all unplayable
anyway when you max out the settings so
the only thing we learned was a valuable
lesson about optimizing your games and
bottlenecking something that could have
been achieved in less time by watching
this episode and this episode of tech
quickie there are a hundred reasons for
wanting multiple computers at your desk
maybe you're a Mac person primarily but
you need a non virtualized Windows
environment for some reason synergy
solves the problem of having to have two
keyboards and two mice for two or more
separate computers you can share one set
of peripheral so you'll no longer get
confused and the whole thing is seamless
you just drag the mouse from one screen
to another we're talking PC Mac and even
Linux support they offer a basic and
perl option for synergy with a one-time
payment and features include advanced
stuff like clipboard sharing between
computers dragging and dropping files
between computers the ability to set up
hotkeys and more so use our link in the
video description to get 50% off synergy
