to be validating if our idea for the
rendering machine over there is going to
work but first we need a long Uther net
cable so FreshBooks
is the online invoicing solution that
lets you get organized save time and get
paid faster click on this spot right
here for a free trial now alright so one
of the few pieces of the puzzle still
MIT well there's a few pieces of the
puzzle still missing ok one of the
pieces that the puzzle is still missing
is getting a 10 Gigabit Ethernet
connection to that machine so we've
swapped out to the Supermicro board that
doesn't have it on board but the good
news is oh I just dropped one ok well
the good news is my X 540 s and other 10
gigabit cards are here now so we're
going to go ahead and get that puppy
linked up then we have to actually build
the machine I've just had it in a test
bench up till now so huh this this was
the thinking behind the carabiners in
the ceiling
okay
so now in theory
we are 10-gigabit sick all right we're
good so let's let's actually let's
actually build this machine finally
finally okay so I thought that this RPC
4224 was actually going to be one for us
to grow into but it looks like we need
it now so this is the last of my 4u
cases from Norco that they graciously
provided for our new server room and we
are going to be using this one for the
rendering machine so there's all of our
mounting hardware is a there's a nice
soft foam that my cat would eat if he
could get at it and he would try to
swallow it and he would then get it
stuck in his stomach which he did again
costing me another $1,200
he does it again I'm gonna kill him
that's twice in four months he's eating
foam and he did surgery
oh so there is it yeah it would have
been cheaper to get two new cats the
first time now I could have had three
new cats and like a pretty cool lizard
but he's my baby and I love him that's
what I tell myself like gee why doesn't
Linus have a Lambo with all that YouTube
money because he has the world's most
expensive cat that's why okay I'm gonna
need a minute to clear some space here I
think
and machine gun power supply now I could
leave the 860 I that I have in there but
then if I ever want to actually put
graphics cards in because I'm going to
take those graphics cards out if I ever
wanted to put proper graphics cards in
then I would have to replace it with
something else which is kind of a pain
but so mmm you know what no I'm gonna
stick with the 860 I the odds of
throwing graphics cards in here are
pretty slim
do you know how long it's been since
I've seen a motherboard where I actually
have to pop the covers on the aisle
plate off myself it's like are you for
real
Yolo man oh that's really tight okay I
need pliers okay just doing a quick test
fit here finding out where the devil all
the holes are so that one over there and
this one right here what okay so if that
one there's that one there's that one
where's this one you need all of them
well that's optimal Eve it - I think
that's an idea um this show is all about
the right way to do things so it's at
least three
I guess we'll need a power supply at
some point okay
oh my bad defender is over at the
frontier it's perfect it's like
Christmas kind of a weak Christmas a
hand header your expectations are so
high how how did you know that I wasn't
going to do fan headers for Christmas
bonuses this year now my feelings are
hurt they should be you know how that my
feelings are hurt maybe there'll be no
Christmas bonus do you ever think of
that but you'd rather have a fan header
than nothing
yeah I think I'd rather nothing than fan
headers just because it's kind of
insulting duly noted
sorry Christmas everyone
is poop oh you don't like poop oh you
want Putin nothing fish I think everyone
in the comments will agree with me that
fan headers are better than poop that
doesn't even make sense
at least you've used poop or what
leaving on your boss's desk forgiving a
fan ever since azuz give you I actually
ordered a game with little turds and
velcro helmets that you wear that they
stick to on Amazon that I was thinking
we'd play on until super flood so it
occurs to me now I need a graphics card
I didn't really want to put one in here
but this motherboard has no onboard
graphics and you're sure you can't use a
Titan so I'm thinking as I install the
power supply this is the one piece of
hardware in this machine that I would
really like to change not because the
860 watt isn't enough for for what we're
going to do and that may be the case in
the future if we find some kind of
application that can take advantage of
GPU which is why I wanted a motherboard
in the first place that would support
multiple GPUs but the reason I would
like to have a different power supply in
here is actually more to do with
redundancy but finding a
the mini redundance that's what they're
called a mini redundant power supply one
in this form factor of sufficient
wattage for this system with a couple of
high-power GPUs actually not not easy
there was a 600 watt there may be
something higher than that feel free to
leave a message in the comments if you
guys can can find something better than
that but yeah I'm pretty much stuck with
a single non redundant power supply the
good news is this is a very reliable
power supply and this machine won't
actually be storing anything
mission-critical data goes on to another
server gets ripped off of it and then
transcoded over to another server by
this one it never actually actually
touches the data so it should be fine
it's just I would rather I would rather
it was actually redundant and it'll be
on a UPS as well so the power supply
would have to fail to take it down even
temporarily I guess it's alright alright
in theory this boots now anytime hey
alright ok
so here we are here's our 72 CPU threads
only half of which are actual course
weaksauce I know and this my friends is
the reason for some of the confusion
around this particular system had a lot
of people asking things like why do you
need so many CPU cores to which I
replied nothing because I wasn't really
ready to talk about the solution was yet
the reason we need so many CPU cores is
we're going to be using it for
transcoding and then doing the final
outputs of our videos to make our videos
easier to work on on our workstations
without lag as we're scrubbing through
the timeline and to make our exports
more seamless of the finished videos and
hopefully faster question number 2 - why
aren't you running Linux on a server
it's a server to which my reply is well
gee I guess if you may be asked what
software we were using I might have been
able to reply that the software we're
using doesn't
run on Linux and in fact there isn't a
Linux version so we're going to be using
Sorenson squeezed server and how this
works is pretty much it's this is a
server of our server we are going to be
using Sorenson squeezed server and the
way that works is we pretty much have a
watch folder that we drop files into and
it transcodes them for us so we had to
do a fair bit of experimentation by we I
mean Edie who's behind the camera had to
do a fair bit of experimentation to find
out exactly how much we could get out of
our 36 CPU cores and if we did would it
even do anything positive for our
workflow so the exact workflow is not a
hundred percent finalized yet but what
we do know is that if we use in code and
watch folders and we set ourselves up a
watch folder and a destination when we
ingest footage off of our cards which
will be over Thunderbolts will actually
be able to ingest very quickly even off
multiple cards automatically our watch
folder is going to take those and apply
a particular preset to them so we can
take a big whack of footage which we've
actually got on the local disk here and
then we are going to copy here and well
this will do two things so number one it
will take the footage off of our SD
cards which we would cut paste instead
of copy pasting and then number two now
that it's safely on our storage array it
will take these and transcode them to a
different easier to work with format and
then boot them out somewhere else so in
this case we are using another local
folder which loops I just pause that
which may end up being a bottleneck but
we'll we'll do a quick experiment before
this video is over to find out if our
ten gigabit network is going to benefit
us here what we're waiting for now as
the files copy is we've set up our watch
folder to monitor itself everyone
minute and then start processing so we
can have a look at our current jobs
nothing has happened yet
but we'll know soon enough because our
CPU is going to start going bananas here
oh here we go here we go
I don't something's happening 5% 7% CPU
let's see if the job is showing up yeah
there we go so you can see it's taking
all these clips and importing them then
transcoding them then it does something
else and there's a lot of there's a lot
of waiting involved but our CPU usage
should start to slowly ramp up as more
of them get past the importing stage and
make it to the encoding stage excuse me
transcoding
which I guess is also encoding 76 oh
it's going up to 85% oh now it's working
well what the sim heck I guess it just
takes a while to get all fired up or
something look at it go we're actually
getting a fairly reasonable turbo
frequency out of this whole process like
2.7 plus gigahertz right now so there's
actually a couple of different views we
can get of this it looks like CPU zero
is getting most of the love but we can
actually change it to look at the two
different Numa nodes and you can see
that CPU zeros utilization is higher but
it's not that much how well it is quite
a bit higher so it is significantly
higher than then node 1 and then we can
also change the graph to overall
utilization so you can see as it climbs
really high CPU one kind of catches up
to zero but it is it is significantly
lower none of these jobs are finished
they're all at the importing or
transcoding stage still he's very
interesting ok so we're only seeing like
max highest peak 70% CPU utilization and
we realized that the last time we
validated any of this it was actually in
this server with one of the processors
plugged into the motherboard
so maybe the advantage that this one has
over the one we're using now is much
much faster storage so if we can connect
to this one over the network then we
should be able to leverage that storage
in theory so let's fire up the 24 SSD
server and see if using that as a target
helps one gigabyte per second over the
network and what's interesting about
being able to see network utilization
here is that unlike local disk
utilization we know where the hard cap
is and it gives us a really clear idea
of how much CPU utilization corresponds
to how much network utilization you can
see network is actually not even
changing in spite of the fact that CPU
is gone from 13 to 45 percent but what's
remains to be seen is whether our CPU
usage will go higher than it was able to
before with less of a storage bottleneck
so like so many of our videos this one
ends up actually raising more questions
than it answers but hopefully we were at
least able to answer the question of why
we wanted such a high powered server
it's to enable a smoother workflow when
multiple people are hitting the files at
the same time and in order to have an
easy quick way to replicate our data as
soon as we ingest it onto our server so
we can avoid the current workflow which
is just leave it on the SD card just in
case because there's only one copy on
the server
this way we'll actually have a copy on
one server and a copy on another one as
soon as we've ingested the footage and
it has gone through this transcoding
process okay so we're back at the yeah
the current office for now but that
doesn't mean I'm not going to take an
opportunity to tell you guys about our
sponsor today here and that is a tre not
har in spite of the fact that these
things go in your ears is a pretty
unique little campaign that's up on
Kickstarter right now now to be clear
these are not earbuds they're not a
bluetooth handset they're not any of
those things what they are is they're a
real-world real-time sort of audio
Effects applicator so you can adjust the
volume of the real world you can change
EQ settings of the real world you can go
ahead and you know like say for example
you're at a concert and you're like you
know what this could use some reverb you
whip up the app on your phone and if all
goes according to plan you will be able
to add like a concert hall sound to that
dude in the cubicle next to you if you
so desire you can do more useful things
with it for example like tuning out a
baby on an airplane or even the engine
noise on an airplane simply by making
adjustments through the app there
quoting a six-hour battery life and it
comes with a charging case that holds an
additional two charges so over the
course of your day I'm sure you'll come
up with a lot of interesting effects
application things to do to it now you
might be asking yourself okay well hold
on a second what about the latency
they're quoting 30 microseconds between
the microphone on the outside and the
speaker on the inside taking noises
changing them and then blasting them
into your doesn't have to be blasting
because if there's a volume control and
then blasting them into your ears for
you to hear so if you're curious to
learn more you want to support them
check out the Kickstarter page which is
linked in the video description thanks

channel super fun that we did where
mm-hmm a certain Terran van he Mert and
an electrical vehicle and some thug life
involved
I don't think that's how you hold it you
should probably have closed
