water cool your system you had one of
two options either you bought a
closed-loop sealed liquid cooler which
has some lacking customizability and
options or you bought a bunch of
different individual parts put them
together yourself which while
interesting can be difficult for those
who are not experienced tinkerers but
lately we've been seeing units that
offer the convenience of an all-in-one
showing up at your door pre-made but
have the expandability of a
do-it-yourself solution enter the ek
predator 240 and ek predator 360 which
also claimed a fairly significant amount
more performance does it live up to that
claim stay tuned to find out
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
show you the length of the video
description to learn more now what's
interesting about the predator is that
it's not really its own product at all
it's kind of more an assembly of other
parts all of the individual parts the
pump the rad the block etc you can
actually get from ek including the
Vardar fans that are included so more or
less this is a kit that comes
preassembled and that's actually kind of
cool it also comes with a fan hub which
is really nice and the cable management
around the unit is great although one
not necessarily good thing depending on
what your system is configured as is
that the predator is exclusively an
intel socket cooler it does not have
compatibility for AMD cpus so yeah be
wary of that if you are an AMD cpu user
also if you are a user of an LGA 2011
dash 3 board that doesn't have mounting
screws that go all the way through the
PCB you will need to order special
screws from ek z' website why they don't
include this no especially considering
it's a high end cooler ed I'd appreciate
those 4 extra screws the installation
went pretty well except for one pretty
significant hiccup one of the fittings
popped out of the block and we had a
pretty major leak on our hands going all
over our system which was not fun it
should be noted that expandable a iOS
will have a higher likely nosov coming
apart the non expandable ones a lot of
non expandable ones are heat sealed and
stuff expendable ones are designed to be
able to be taken apart but it shouldn't
pop out after a couple twists and turns
from installing a new system so that was
a bit of a disappointment
once when you're done cleaning
everything up we mounted the predator
240 inside of our Corsair C 70 case and
ran I to 60 for stability tests on the
CPU and then fur mark on the GPU just to
kind of heat things up in the system it
performed quite well at 1100 rpms and
even when we cranked the fan speed up to
full they weren't too loud and the
performance did improve which was good
to see and good to hear but since we
mentioned earlier the ek predator series
is an expandable loop so we wanted to
test it with more things in the loop
thanks EK they
sent us a Titan X water block so that we
could use it in the same system
the 240 the ek predator 240 had some
issues bleeding the air bubbles in the
loop that was a little frustrating so we
moved up to the 360 which we kind of
wanted to bench anyways so it was fine
it also features quick disconnects so it
was a lot easier to add something to the
loop because you could just partially
take the loop apart without anything
leaking without the need to refill add
things to it and then keep on moving on
I must note here that we had to just
kind of leave the 360 millimetre rad
outside of the case the Corsair C 70
that we used doesn't really work with
three hundred sixty millimeter cases
unless you do some pretty intense ghetto
modding and even then not so much so we
opted to leave it outside it's not
really a fair comparison against the
other coolers but we did crank up firm
arc to 4k and with 4k fur mark running
on the GPU and the CPU still being
pushed by i-264 stability test the
temperatures on this thing we're pretty
impressive I was quite happy with it so
in conclusion if you're looking for a
more advanced water cooling setup but
still don't necessarily want to piece
everything together yourself or if
you're experienced and have pieced
things together before but just want the
premium components just want to put it
in your case relatively quickly the
predator is not a bad idea really high
performance feels very premium all
around has a fan controller built in all
that kind of stuff it is a little
expensive and if you can fit a 360
millimeter rad in your case I might
recommend actually moving up it's a lot
more cooling and you get those quick
disconnects which if you are going to
expand this system are really nice
especially because it's not the easiest
thing in the world to bleed Logitech has
been in the headphone game for a really
long time and it shows with the g6 33
artemus spectrum headset the g6 33 is
equipped with Logitech's 40 millimeter
projet audio drivers some point 1 dolby
surround sound with logitech gaming
software a cardioid boom mic which hides
way very nicely in the headset a fully
adjustable RGB lighting setup and custom
tags they're available from a variety of
retailers now including Amazon and could
be a great holiday gift for a PC Xbox or
even ps4 gamer or just a great pickup
