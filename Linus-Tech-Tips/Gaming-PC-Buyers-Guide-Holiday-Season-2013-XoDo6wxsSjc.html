system buyer's guide we're going to be
taking three different price points so
that is five hundred dollars or what
we're calling just game because it's a
no-frills gaming box I mean it doesn't
even have USB 3 our second price point
is around a thousand dollars and we're
calling that game now because it's a
well-rounded gaming box built for today
it's that gamers sweet spot and then our
third price point we're calling game on
or the more future proof and upgradeable
gaming box although really I hate using
those words because there's no such
thing as a future-proof system but at
any rate it has some extra bells and
whistles and it costs a little bit more
to go along with that it comes in at
around $1700 well it always starts with
the CPU doesn't it so the athlon x4 750
K at 80 bucks is a great choice it's
about five dollars more than the 740 but
you get that K unlocked multiplier which
might not be relevant with the hardware
we have in there I really don't
recommend overclocking the system in its
current configuration in tell dual core
is that in the past or even really in
the present most games benefit more from
fewer but more powerful cores so we
would recommend core i3 s normally but
we're seeing frostbite 3 as well as
AMD's mantle API upcoming that are going
to make much better use of more cores
even if they're less powerful so that
makes me pretty confident in this
recommendation for the near future now
for RAM we went with a single 8 gig
module of whatever was the cheapest
round we could find it's about 60 bucks
and the reason we went with a single
module is that our FM to a 55 MD GS our
2.0 motherboard only has two memory
slots so while we do get slightly lower
performance for going with a single
module versus dual channel operation
what that means is we can upgrade to 16
gigs of ram later on down the road by
simply adding another 8 gig module
rather than forcing ourselves to remove
to-four gig modules throw them away and
add to 8 gig modules in order to achieve
the same effect
now this board doesn't have really any
features to speak of it doesn't even
have USB 3 but for 50 bucks it's hard to
go wrong and it does work we do have one
so if you want other stuff you can spend
another 20 bucks or whatever
else and you can get a more feature-rich
board but this one is just game that's
what it does for our power supply this
is where we never recommend buying
generic so we went with the most basic
brand name power supply we could get
which was the enttec basic 350 at 30
bucks it's a ground ten fifteen dollars
more expensive than a generic power
supply but at the very least you know
that it's rated for continuous power and
you know that if it says it has over
current protection on it or whatever
safety certification on it that it
actually has it and it was actually
tested you'd be amazed how many power
supplies out there are not validated and
don't have the features that they claim
to have so that's why we went with that
I've again then not overclocking ready
components and speaking of not
overclocking ready we are using the
stock cooler and the like the cheapest
apex case we could find you can get this
thing for as low as 20 bucks it's
functional but it doesn't have great
cooling so no overclocking so far except
the CPU so guys you would need to make
some upgrades to the config for
overclocking now okay the case does have
one thing going for it though and that
is it does have ventilation in the side
panel above the CPU area as well as
above the graphics card area so when we
put that HD 7850 weather we get a 1 gig
card or a 2 gig card that'll affect
pricing by about 25 bucks but a 2 gig
card will run you around 155 dollars
it'll have somewhere to exhaust the heat
now this card is an untouchable value I
would have loved to present you guys
with here's the AMD option here's the
Nvidia option that makes sense at this
price point and Vidya doesn't really
have anything that's that competitive at
this price point but the cold hard truth
of the matter is neither does AMD the
7850 is an outgoing card it's it's a
discontinued model so once these are
gone they're pretty much going to be
gone so I'd recommend grabbing one now
if you're interested in it for our
storage you have a couple of options so
number one is the Western Digital blue
one terabyte it's available for around
$70 number two is the kingston v300 120
gig SSD for around $80 i had people
telling me a little while ago i was
talking about something oh you're crazy
Linus you can't put an SSD and a $500
machine yes you can and yes it
absolutely makes a very big difference
at the matter of whether you're willing
to go for the SSD now install just some
of your games and wait until you can add
a hard drive later when you
another allowance so you get another
paycheck or whatever else or whether you
must have the storage now in which case
go with the WD blue now our pricing for
this system was before Windows Windows 8
is about $100 but if you already have a
Windows license that you can reuse or if
you're planning to use a free OS such as
Linux then you obviously don't have to
buy that so that is what we'd consider
to be optional our game now system I
actually struggled with a fair bit I I
ended up with some recommendations that
I think are going to sound a little bit
unusual but if you guys hear me out
maybe you'll agree and if you don't of
course let me know in the comments so
for the CPU I went with a core i5 33:30
this is a non case cube but unlike
Haswell Ivy Bridge non K CPUs can be
overclocked a little bit and you can get
around 3.6 comfortably out of these
chips which will put it in about the
same performance range as something like
a 46 70 K which costs a full $50 more
that gives us a lot of money to work
with elsewhere in the build so for
memory we went with 8 gigs of ram again
at around 60 bucks you can get either a
single module or a dual channel kit and
you can decide whether you care more
about having the extra little bit of
performance from dual channel now or if
you care more about being able to expand
to 32 gigs of ram in the future
depending which way you go because both
boards that are options at this price
range the z77 pro 3 or pro 4 are
available for around $95 however z77
boards are becoming less common so
pretty much buy whatever you can for the
power supply we went with a see sonic
620 what this is the s12 2 this is a
much better power supply than the one in
the last system which was nothing
special other than that it just had a
proper brand name and like proper
certifications on it at $65 to $80 this
is AC Sonic 620 watt unit is efficient
it's quiet and it is just fantastic
speaking of things that are efficient in
quiet we went with the hyper 212 plus
again we're talking about a moderate
overclocking system here and for 30
bucks this is a great value because the
stock cooler just really isn't good
enough for any overclocking these days
for the case we want the 200 our same
thing more solid build quality so this
is around a 50 $60 case than that $20
$30 case that we looked at
or much better ventilation better brand
a better looks just better in every
possible way in very in very practical
ways now the video card is something
that some people will agree with and
some people won't but I narrowed it down
to I really think the gtx 770 makes the
most sense in this configuration you can
get great performance out of it remember
this is basically equivalent to a gtx
680 and with the holiday bundle which
includes assassin's creed 4 baton on
arkham origins and Splinter Cell
blacklist there's just not really much
on the AMD side that is comparable to
that the 280 X is about the same price I
was able to find 770's as cheap as
around 310 dollars and just doesn't have
the same oof that the 770 does not to
mention I am a huge advocate of Nvidia
shield I think it's awesome and 770 is
the lowest end card that allows you to
get $100 off a shield so you can get it
for $200 now because of some of the
money that we saved elsewhere in the
build our storage solution becomes a lot
more robust so for our SSD we went with
the kingston v300 120 gig drive it's not
the fastest SSD in the world but for 80
to 90 dollars it is a very compelling
value and you will notice a difference
if you install your OS and your most
frequently used programs on it then we
were able to grab a 2 terabyte Seagate
hard drive and throw that at the system
for mass storage now this gives us a ton
of flexibility we could go with 90 gigs
of OS SSD and allocate 30 gigs to use as
a cache using Smart Response technology
on the hard drive or we could just go
120 slash 2 terabyte or whatever else
the case may be either way because of
that money that we saved by giving up
point 4 gigahertz and a 10% IPC
improvement and then doing a little bit
of overclocking we were able to get this
great storage solution and a rockin
video card then of course if you need
Windows then that's an extra hundred
dollars and whether or not you already
have that as your business in the
performance game on segment where we're
you know future proofing things a little
bit and color matching them a little bit
it became a lot easier because I have a
bit of flexibility I don't have to worry
about every three dollars that I'm
spending and is it contributing to the
bottom line in terms of performance so
we started with a 4770k which gives
you pretty much no benefit today over
something like a 46 70 K but again
frostbite 3 and mantle coming with you
know there being more benefit to more
threads we're going to go ahead we're
going to sort of place our bets and
spend an extra hundred bucks on
something with hyper-threading and
overclocking potential all that stuff
for RAM we went with 16 gigs right out
of the gate both of the other configs
went for 8 gigs and while there's really
no benefit from a gaming perspective to
16 gigs of 1866 Corsair Vengeance blue
today
it matches our motherboard and it is a
little bit more future-proof although
again I really hate that word I hate
that word for motherboard we want the
Asus VA t7 Pro it's got wireless AC it's
an extremely solid board Asus really is
my number one choice when it comes to
motherboards so anything other than Asus
you know that I'm probably making a
compromise somewhere along the line
either of those other configurations you
could pay an extra 20 30 or even 40
dollars and get an Asus equivalent board
but that's exactly the problem is on a
thousand dollar rig or on a 500 dollar
rig I don't feel comfortable spending
that kind of extra money on something
that really just doesn't contribute to
performance and contributes more to
features and robustness so this is
something I'd feel very comfortable
overclocking as high as we could go
speaking of overclocking as high as we
want to go we went with a Corsair txm
750 watt power supply it has four PCI
Express connectors for a potential dual
GPU sli or crossfire upgrade in the
future and is very well built and
modular it has like disconnectable
cables again where we're wasting a few
bucks on something that doesn't
contribute to performance but it does
make your system look better and it does
actually make your air flow slightly
better depending on how your cable
management goes for cooling we went with
the Nhu 12s it's quiet it performs
extremely well and it's not to us so of
course I think it's the bee's knees
because just all their stuff is
fantastic in fact probably have knock
twists up here see this is an excellent
fan the NFP 12 although it's not my
favorite fan anymore the NFF 12 is now
my favorite fan for the case I went with
a fractal design define our for the
extra like $60 we're spending on this
case versus the Corsair 200 our is
purely for looks and overall build
quality and you know quiet sound
dampening material and stuff like that
does not contribute anything to
performance
in fact the thermals probably aren't
even quite as good as the 200 are it's
just this is a really really really nice
case and we're going for a more
luxurious build here now while
everything else about the system was
relatively easy I really struggled with
the video card on this one because at
this kind of a price range you can
probably afford to jump up to a 780 but
it costs a full hundred dollars more
than a 290 it does come with three games
as opposed to one so you can find two
90s that come with battlefield 4 or you
can find seven 80s that come with the
Assassin's Creed 4 Batman Arkham origins
as well as Splinter Cell blacklist
bundle but and the 290 is louder
noticeably louder runs hotter than the
780 but is near it in terms of sheer FPS
performance and costs about $100 less so
you guys got to make a decision here do
you want to spend an extra hundred
dollars for better temperatures lower
noise potentially better game bundle
depending how you feel about the games
that are included it the $200 discount
on shield Nvidia g-sync potentially in
the future if you wanted to upgrade your
monitor in a couple months and get
something because it's really as
revolutionary it's awesome or if you
want to go ahead go for the more value
oriented solution now and you're willing
to take a hit on power consumption as
well as acoustics and temperatures you
think md mantle is going to be an
outstanding piece of technology even
though we really haven't seen it yet
then 290 looks like a good bet so if I
had to pick one in this price point I
kind of had to go with 290 but I think
780 is also a very solid choice if you
have the extra hundred dollars to spend
now for storage things got easy again
because the Samsung 840 Evo is just
plain a better Drive than the more value
oriented SSD where we're looking at
before we can afford a 250 gig drive so
you can actually fit your OS and like a
fair number of games and programs on it
and it's got some awesome features like
their data migration software as well as
rapid which allows you to use RAM in
order to accelerate the drive itself and
is very intuitive to setup and actually
works really well and then for our
storage drive we went with a WD red 3
terabyte this might seem like a weird
option because it's a raid drive but the
things that make it a good raid Drive
like the fact that it's more resistant
to vibration
just generally more robust you know it's
not the fastest drive in the world
compared to something like a blue or a
black makes it a very compelling option
if you're not putting your most you know
performance sensitive data on it which
you're not because you have a 250 gig
SSD in your system so overall this
system is very well rounded Windows 8 is
of course another hundred dollars very
well rounded extremely high performance
when it comes to gaming and I think is a
more normal overall build I hope that
you enjoyed our shopping for a PC
holiday build guide generally why did we
do this
well reason number one was that you guys
have been asking us to do this
absolutely forever and reason number two
is that we've I don't know if you notice
this but we did not have a pre-roll on
this video so we are experimenting with
using affiliate revenue where we take
the knowledge that we have about what's
good that you guys want to know and we
tell you and then you click on the links
that we provide you with to buy them and
then we get a commission out of that
we're experimenting with using that as a
way to supplement or even long term
perhaps replace paid advertising spots
on our videos so let me know what you
think of that idea let me know what you
thought of the holiday buyer's guide and
I think that's pretty much it like the
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment if you have
something to say about my choices and
how they were terrible or how they were
fantastic and as always guys don't
