isn't wired for networking there are a
variety of ways to get an internet
connection to the place where you need
it
powerline Wi-Fi the problem with these
solutions is that they're just not as
good as a good old-fashioned cat5e the
problem with a good old-fashioned cat5e
is that sometimes it is nearly
impossible to get it from where your
internet connection comes into the house
and your network switches to where you
want it to be without creating either a
tripping hazard or in my case a wife
hazard

the link in the video description to
learn more so the objective today is to
run an ethernet cable from my networking
closet on the second-story down to the
first storey where my media center and
my TV are in order to eliminate the
tripping and wife hazards though we're
going to be taking it outside so to
speak and running the ethernet cable
along the siding on the outside of the
house however before you embark on a
project like this there are some
considerations number one is mapping out
where exactly your entry and exit wounds
are going to be and we'll show you some
simple tricks for how to find exactly
the right spots to drill the next one is
figuring out how long your run needs to
be to find a balance between the
shortest possible run which is always
good for signal integrity and optimizing
your aesthetics as well as the
durability of the cable if your run goes
way across a very sunny self-facing
patch it might not last as long even if
you're using a UV rated exterior cable
we'll show you how to anchor your cable
to wood as well as brick or concrete and
finally we'll show you how we're
terminating the jacks on both sides so
it not only works well but looks
professional let's begin with a rundown
of everything we're going to need for
our job today first of all we've got a
hundred feet of cat 5e cable that we
paid about 50 bucks for why did we pay
that much I'm glad you asked it's
because this is outdoor rated cat 5e
which means that if it is in direct
sunlight it's not going to pretty much
immediately break down the way that an
indoor cable would next we've got the
wiring diagram for our twisted pairs as
well as some rj45 connectors to
terminate both ends of the cable we've
got a crimper to make that whole thing
happen and then when it comes to
actually putting holes in the house to
run the cables through we've got an
impact drill with a couple of bits so
the larger one here and this is a 3/8
inch bit
is going to be for the cable itself and
then we've got ourselves a caulking gun
you know what job is complete without
the to make sure that the hole
seals and doesn't actually leak water
into the house which would be bad and
then we have a second bit and this puppy
is a 3/16 inch bit and this one is for
the plastic inserts that we're going to
use to run our cable straps so these are
little cable management ties on the
brick and concrete where needed in order
to make our run nice and clean now we've
also got some regular wood screws here
these are just some robertson Head wood
screws as well as some more straps for
where we're running the cable along the
wood and finally we've got ourselves an
electric screwdriver as well as one of
these handy dandy little mounting plates
for where we're going to put the jack
that is going to come out of the wall
the one thing we are missing because we
need to do a run to the store is a
female-to-female
piece that goes on here where we can run
our terminated jack into the back of it
and then we can plug our jack into the
other side and run it to the TV or a
network switch or whatever else as we
went along we realized there were a few
more things we needed a measuring tape a
marking pencil a drywall saw a hammer
and of course safety glasses now we know
that the downstairs connection needs to
go through this wall but if we were to
measure it from the outside it would be
easy to overlook things like that my
living room has a sunken floor and we
could end up at completely the wrong
height or the wrong distance away from
the wall so to make sure that we're
drilling at the correct height we
actually need to take things inside for
our measurements so from in here we can
decide exactly where it is that we want
our jack to come out so I'm kind of
thinking a little off to the left of
this power outlet right about there so
the first thing we need to know is the
height so we go okay a standard wall
jack has its bottom about 12 inches off
the floor exactly 12 inches off the
floor and a perfect
well so we're going to aim for about 14
inches here so we go ahead and make a
little mark on our wall at 14 inches
then we find a landmark that is common
to both the inside and the outside of
the house so in our case we can use the
bottom of the glass on this window and
measure that to our 14 inch mark so it
looks like about 19 and a half inches
the next thing we need to know is the
distance along the wall fortunately once
again we have an easy landmark because
we can actually see the brick on the
outside of the house which is what we'll
have to measure from when we're out
there so doing some somewhat approximate
yes this isn't quite perfect but it's
good enough for our purposes eyeballing
we can line up the edge of our measuring
tape with that brick and then kind of go
okay we need to go across about oh I
don't know 28 inches so there you have
it 19 and a half down from the window 28
inches over from the edge of the wall
and we should pretty much hit that spot
okay so now that we're out here we can
see about eighteen and a half inches
down is right on this mortar line which
is really handy because it means that as
long as you've got brick or wood siding
or something along those lines you can
actually follow it along assuming that
it is probably pretty level and then
take your second measurement 28 inches
which and this is more good luck lends
us right on this point right here so
that means we can drill through mortar
rather than the brick which is going to
do less damage to the look of the wall
and also has less of a chance of
cracking something as you go through we
can put our cable through and then run
it right down here under this metal
flashing and cable management along the
concrete here at the bottom so then
without further ado we've got our drill
set to the hammer drill setting bear in
mind you don't necessarily have to have
a big old rugged one like this a lot of
just normal hand drills will have a
hammer setting you can just check yours
and it's off to the races
actually our masonry bit didn't end up
being long enough to punch through the
plywood so we've got a spade bit here
and while I could you know try to use my
landmarking to make a hole on the other
side exactly where this one is and if I
measured perfectly that would work it's
a little bit easier since I'm in here
anyway to just punch through the drywall
now and they'll know exactly where I
made my hole from the outside so for the
next step because we want a socket in
there we're going to expand the hole we
made with a drywall saw to just the size
of the perimeter of the inside of this
wall plate then what we're going to do
is screw the wall plate in which will
make these little flanges here grip onto
the drywall holding it into place this
gives us somewhere to mount that plate
that we're going to add later so with
our hole complete we take one end of our
ethernet cable and run it through the
hole self-explanatory now you're going
to want to leave yourself a little bit
of extra cable in the wall because the
next step crimping the end onto the
cable is the most likely reason that
your cable run might not end up working
so you want to have enough extra that
you can cut off what you did and redo it
so here we are with the cable on the
other side and this won't be by any
means the world's most comprehensive how
to terminate your own Ethernet cables
guide but basically you strip the outer
sheathing then because this is an
outdoor cable there's going to be some
goop in there don't worry about that you
still as normal separate all your
twisted pairs align them in the correct
order according to your diagram place
them into the cutting tool on the
crimper with the length such that you
will have the outer sheathing sticking
into the connector about this far then
feed all the ends without any need to
strip them insert the whole thing into
the slotted part of the crimping tool
crimp and
it actually shouldn't take longer than a
minute or so per end once you get the
hang of it
so the next step here is to break out
that smaller masonry bit remember you
won't need that if you're running along
wood you can just use your screws and
put them right into the siding for the
cable straps but we're going to be using
the masonry bit as well as our little
plastic inserts to every 12 to new 16
inches or so place one of our cable
straps for a nice tight cable management
line under the metal flashing so that
it's not visible from a person's eye
level then we're going to remove the
downspout and run the cable up the
corner where the downspout is making it
other than the entry hole and a small
hole up in the top of the soffit
basically invisible one up there oh hi
ha well that worked out so now that
we've got our wire in the wall we need
to put some caulking in there to keep
moisture from seeping in along the wire
this will dry clear once we're done now
if you were doing a project with a
longer run it's possible that you would
be stuck with more cable visible from
the outside of the house but the limit
is pretty much your own creativity here
and the best practice is - generally
speaking follow the lines of the house
whether it's siding or whether it's a
vertical you know end piece or finishing
piece and keep it in quarters as much as
possible okay yeah so this is it
homestretch we've got the wire out of
the crawlspace and all that's left to do
is cut it to the appropriate length here
here we go we're not going to bother
with the you know nice new wall-mounted
jack or anything like that so I just got
to crawl over here put it through that
same hole that everything else is using
you get this nice shot of my butt in the
meantime I got a Brennan looks like I
pull this baby out here terminate it and
that's it that's the run that's running
an Ethernet cable on the outside
of the house for not only tidier but
crazy shorter run it turns out depending
on where it is you're trying to get from
and where it is you're trying to get to
wasn't that fun learning how to do
something for ourselves well you know
what you can do for yourself get better
deals on stuff over on mass drop mass
