gets featured on the when show bill
blogs the week section more than any
other case click now to learn more about
it alright guys so it's sort of day two
it's actually still kind of day one but
I'm splitting up the vlog a little bit
just because things are happening or
they're not happening anyway we came
back very recently from the pretty
underwhelming Ubisoft tour I think
everyone's expectations were a little
bit higher given how much hype there was
but basically we walked through a
building which was cool you know seeing
a game dev studio where lots of people
were working at desks and then we we saw
that like kind of a cool like video
about how they do some motion capture
stuff but no real details and then and
then we left so it was it was pretty
short so that was a little bit
disappointing but I'm on my way to a
hockey game now so hopefully that will
be much much more entertaining gonna go
see some Habs action and a boom boom
yeah I'm gonna boo them alright so we're
going to the game now they split up me
and this guy on account of he can get
kind of rowdy and we're liable to end up
scrapping and son
really really that's it you're gonna
assume that you'd be beating me up you
won't even call it a fight you're gonna
call it a beat-down bully basically
bully
you're not even that much taller than
you you've got maybe 25 pounds on me
yeah maybe maybe everybody six inches
taller than me no so
this is the this is the dessert tray so
it's like the largest carrot cake ever
oh oh I almost got in the way heart
attack yeah Oh someone finally got the
if the chocolate paradise is that right
the last one this is the second Chuck oh
that's the second one okay because I'm
gonna need a piece of that one can I get
one of those okay yes please
oh we're out of plates so I'm back after
the hockey game that was fun I might
have lost my voice a little bit but not
too bad what I heard through the
grapevine is that there's something
crazy going down tomorrow so without
further ado I'm gonna go edit some video
there's my computer get some sleep and
hopefully we're gonna have some really
exciting stuff to show you in just a
moment here after I sleep I was up late
last night editing and uploading and
then trolling slick on Twitch so I'm
pretty tired hopefully I get a
reasonably good seed I'm gonna be I'm
gonna be two minutes late for breakfast
so I'm ready I'm ready for something
crazy to happen
as like tech press kits I do want a good
seat though so so this much is true I'm
gonna go for this one yeah this one
right here
things have changed a fair bit in here
since yesterday so there's a bunch of
prodigy based gaming rigs all over the
sides here so I guess they're gonna be
demoing something with those presumably
they're like all around the back there
we go there's people manning the
station's presumably we should see what
happens if we try to touch one just just
for fun just for fun let's try and like
play with one I can use this already
right I don't have to wait until after
the presentation yes okay so so as
predicted I am not allowed to use it yet
okay so as promised guys what we saw
down here today was absolutely
incredible
so yesterday yeah they had flex so that
was different types of physics
calculations interacting with each other
they showed us the new global
illumination techniques which are
outstanding and really can be total game
changers because it's taking away the
individual nitpick enos of programming
lighting and instead just giving you a
system that just works kind of on its
own they've got flame works which I
wasn't as sold on the demo for that one
it's dynamic fire i'm the unfortunately
the demo that they did was a dragon
breathing fire which is very different
from a more natural fire so i would have
liked to see a demo that included that
as well but you know well we'll wait for
the wait for that but today what they
showed off was absolutely crazy so first
up was game streams so game stream is
basically an evolution of what we
already saw with shield so in your home
you can already take a kepler
GeForce graphics card equipped PC and
then you can stream your PC games to
Nvidia shield in 720p over Wi-Fi now
we've seen this implemented in other
ways so at PAX we saw Nvidia grid which
is their cloud-based centralized
computing server time machine intended
for cloud-based gaming and we saw that
streaming to shield wirelessly so you
look at that technology and you go ok
well this is going somewhere
well game stream is where it's going so
they've got a 4k TV demo that they did
earlier on in the in the presentation
where they had a shield being used as a
game console effectively so you close it
it goes into console mode and then you
can stream to your shield from your PC
you can use a third-party controller
with shield rather than just relying on
the controller that's built into it
through bluetooth and they've got
validated controllers that are supposed
to be very low latency and then you can
either through a wired connection stream
@ 1080p or through a wireless connection
stream at 720p this you guys is what I'm
talking about this is why the game
console as we know it doesn't really
need to exist anymore particularly for
PC gamers who already have a decent PC
because you can centralize your
computing power in one place and then
you can use it on something like a
shield around the house or you can use
it on your TV and you only need one
device for that now so that is
absolutely fantastic to me
so you couple that with the game bundles
that was another thing that they
announced today but it was on NVIDIA
comm their GeForce talk on pardon me
yesterday so they're giving $100 off a
shield with 77078 II and Titan and
presumably 780ti which they also
announced today and then they're also
giving you three games so the Splinter
Cell blacklist it was Batman Arkham
origins and
oh I feel like I'm forgetting the most
important thing anyway sorry my brains
kind of going a mile a minute here
anyway and then on lower-end GPUs I
think 660 enough but don't put me on
that you get $50 off a shield so they
want you to do this game streaming thing
where you've got a powerful PC and then
you're able to use it in other ways next
up is shadow play so they're announcing
shadow play again sort of I guess
availability is probably coming soon the
build that they were running here was a
beta and they've announced new
functionality for Shadow plays so aside
from recording the last 20 minutes of
your gameplay and allowing you to save
that on demand they showed off exactly
how low the performance impact is and
it's very very low I mean if I'm someone
like avermedia for example I'm looking
at something like shadow play going Oh
balls
because anyone running a GeForce
graphics card will not have a reason
unless they must capture to an external
PC for some reason to use a device like
that because you can just record to your
computer and there's very little
performance impact I mean it looks like
less than a couple percent just based on
the numbers that we saw and then they've
also announced that shadow play is going
to have integration with twitch so there
rather than relying necessarily on
xsplit although xsplit flexibility is
looks a little bit more than what
they've got there but they are allowing
you to have your game you can stream @
1080p 720p you can overlay your webcam
in whichever corner you can adjust the
size so very rudimentary but very simple
to use from the look of things so the
interface is pretty well thought out the
next thing they showed off was you know
what actually I'm gonna save that for
last so they showed off 780ti which
presumably is I don't know 780 with the
clock bump and some more cuda cores or
something like that or maybe it's more
like something like titan but without
the full double precision performance so
so that'll be a slightly faster 780
which is cool and maybe we'll see a
price drop on 780 we don't we don't know
yet so more details on that to come
the idea is very similar so it looks the
same but that could mean anything
because all of them videos graphics
cards lately it looked outstanding okay
so let's move on to gsync that's the one
where they have demos set up all around
the room and they talked a lot about the
fundamental problems that we have as PC
gamers or gamers in general because on
the console they spend a lot of time
optimizing the title and yes that
includes optimization for visual
fidelity and programming as close to
bare metal as they can on the hardware
and all those console optimizations that
were used to talking about but what they
can also optimize for is a target
framerate and making sure that it stays
there so it delivers of consistent
experience and a consistent frame rate
so you don't see those issues like
stuttering and tearing that you do on PC
games because on a PC your monitor most
monitors these days are refreshing at 60
Hertz high performance ones are up to
120 140 for your Hertz you don't have to
deal with the fact that your graphics
card is going to be drawing frames at a
much different rate than your monitors
so whenever those two things don't match
up perfectly in an ideal world I'm
hopefully gonna remember to put a slide
up here right now that shows you how it
would work so your GPU would within the
refresh rate of the monitor would draw a
new frame then your monitor would
display it to you and while it's
displaying it to you your GPU would draw
a new frame and be ready to go when the
monitor is ready to refresh in the real
world that's not really how it works so
you can turn on vsync in order to make
sure that the monitor only draws afraid
so basically the graphics card will wait
for the monitor to refresh but what
happens is anytime the framerate dips
below 60fps you're gonna see what's
called stuttering where sometimes the
same frame is displayed on the monitor
for two full refresh cycles or heaven
forbid even even more and that's very
noticeable in games now they introduced
adaptive vsync a while ago and that's
somewhat alleviated the issue because it
would turn vsync on and off dynamically
what FPS you were running the game at
but now we have a more permanent
solution okay so hold on but vsync
introduces lag as well because the
monitor is waiting for the graphics card
rather is waiting for the monitor to
display something before it continues to
work so you're wasting GPU cycles
effectively you can turn vsync off and
you can get less leg which means that
the GPU will output as soon as it's
ready but you're going to sometimes have
the monitor refresh when you're halfway
through rendering one scene and halfway
you're still looking at the last thing
you saw and that's called tearing so
that's where you have those vertical
lines where the scene is you're looking
at one scene and then and sometimes
multiple scenes if the frame rate is
very very high on the same frame on your
monitor so that's not really optimal
either Shoji Singh is invidious
technology that will allow those issues
to go away and the problem existed
because the graphics part in the monitor
we're never working in sync the monitor
was displaying at its frame rate and the
graphics card was displaying its frame
rate and they were independent of each
other whereas now with G Singh and gsync
enabled monitors which is a hardware
chip so guys for those of you wondering
is this gonna work on Radeon graphics
cards is this going to work on my
current monitor the answer is I mean
they haven't said that it's not gonna
work on Radeon graphics cards but I can
tell you with a fair degree of
confidence that the answer is no it will
not you will be expected to buy a
certified monitor and a Kepler or
greater GPU from Nvidia in order to take
advantage of g-sync and what g-sync does
is allows the GPU to control the refresh
rate of the monitor so when the
framerate dips the monitors refresh rate
will actually lower so that they match
so we're getting the vsync experience
without the leg because the GPU can
output whatever it wants whenever it
wants and the monitor will be ready for
it because it's actually taking a cue
from the GPU for the display now this
isn't something that unfortunately I can
show on camera because we're we have
another fixed framerate device the
camera that's sitting right in front
because how am I going to show you a
variable framerate on one monitor versus
one side-by-side but they have side by
side demos all over the place here you
guys it is very very real and very very
impressive it works and it's a game
changer so a lot of folks were
speculating that Nvidia would have some
kind of a response to mantle they
haven't announced any kind of
proprietary API so there's no direct
response to mantle but the way that the
landscape is changing right now is going
to make the job of demonstrating how
great a gaming experience is much
different than it used to be it's not a
matter of firing up fraps and seeing
which GPU runs at a higher FPS AMD had a
demo at their event where there were
three 4k monitors running dirt3 in
Eyefinity with two cards running and
crossfire and I actually ended up a half
arguing with the guy about what frame
rate it was running at because he told
me it was 60 which with fraps running it
turned out to be but it was very
noticeably not running out of perceived
60fps and that's that's the frame timing
issue that AMD is struggling with right
now their driver fixes that they're
working on they've partially fixed it in
certain scenarios but 4k Eyefinity isn't
one of them so it was very noticeable
now Nvidia okay so let's say mantle
dramatically improves the frame rates
that an AMD graphics card can kick out
but if nvidia is able to run at a lower
frame rate but eliminate those issues to
the point where it looks butter smooth
to the gamer
well that's that's good too
so yeah today was unbelievable I mean
the fact that they've got live demos
here that we can sit and play with and
how noticeable and tangible the
performance improvement is I mean I
already love shield I might be one of
the only six people in the world who
actually think Shields awesome and I
just got yet another great reason to
care about shield I'm actually gonna
have to upgrade the networking in my
house because I'm using power lines to
my TV right now I'm gonna want to run
Giggy so that I can run at full 1080p
but so they've given me another great
reason to care about shield
they've given us g-sync which we have no
idea how much the monitors are gonna
cost we're looking at q1 2014
availability so you know I think it's
all kind of up in the air right now in
terms of how easy they're gonna be to
get how many are gonna be available how
much they're gonna cost it is going to
be a significant investment into the
ecosystem for someone who doesn't
already have a Kepler GPU to buy that
GeForce graphics card and buy that
g-sync monitor but one of the cool
things about it is that Nvidia is
showing this off with a GTX 760 they
didn't load up all of these test systems
with tighteners or dual Titans or
anything like that so what they're
really showing off is that you don't
have to spend $1000 on the GPU
necessarily to have a great gaming
experience you could get a reasonable
GPU and then you could get a g-sync
monitor and have a great gaming
experience that way so this is this is
awesome I love this how much is Nvidia
paying Linus I actually wrote this in
one of the comments on one of my recent
videos but I might as well just say it
AMD has actually got in terms of money
more engagement with me than Nvidia
there I'm gonna let that sink in for a
moment
so if I was selling out I should sell it
to the highest bidder correct no like
every publication I have to take
advertising and sponsorships and I work
with these partners but that doesn't
mean that what I say has anything to do
with that so if what I said had to do
with that
would be because nvidia is giving me a
bunch of money which they don't so there
you go in fact if you want to factor in
sort of even things like events AMD took
me to Hawaii and NVIDIA took me to
Montreal which is great but it's not
Hawaii so you know what I'm look see and
I'm even getting in trouble for calling
out Nvidia for not he's saying Montreal
is a beautiful city which it is and
you're right anyway guys I think that's
pretty much it for the update for right
now this has been an unbelievable two
days yesterday was unbelievably not as
exciting as I had hoped with that
Ubisoft tour that was very uninspiring
today has been unbelievable because we
saw some crazy awesome stuff I got a I
got a like Instagram this
so yeah of course I'm not gonna pass up
a photo op right so I'm spending all of
my time in hospitals right now and I
think that the head-mounted displays
have there's a lot of what I'm doing now
that feels a lot like the early days of
3d of the first-person stuff and I'm
having a blast I mean I'm working on the
core technology stuff you know in many
ways I feel more like myself than I have
for a long time you know I'm in there
spending all of my time on these hard
technical problems writing tons of code
making things happen and you know it
feels like it's for a worthy cause left
up here Charlie thanks Ella thank you
for a time okay let's use the enforcers
that's not dealing John Carmack lemmas
I'm really not a bad guy there goes the
bad guy all right there we go guys so
unfortunately they need to steal him for
the panel but the good news is that
means that you can probably watch the
panel at some point here although they
stole him took him over there look at
this enforcer just wants a photo op I
bet see look look I'm gonna get him in
all kinds of trouble see he just wanted
a photo op with John Carmack and that is
why he took him away from us see he
claims to not want a photo op and yet
that is a camera phone and that was a
flash</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
