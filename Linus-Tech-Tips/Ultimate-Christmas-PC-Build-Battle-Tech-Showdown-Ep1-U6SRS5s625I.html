tech showdown and if you don't like it
TS get it thank you for that so the
challenge is simple two contestants
build computers around a particular
theme with some help from Coolermaster
the sponsors providing the mastercase
pro as well as some other stuff that
Intel g.skill and ESU's also provided
some of the hardware and the judges
determined who has best captured the
theme of the episode which this time is
Christmas yes just in time for well not
the holiday but the crisps well the
Christmas holiday all right let's get
going oh I'm building my computer here
so I don't need to go anywhere I hear
this guy opening auxes but I actually
have other plans okay yep just working
over here hold on
this is my actual plan I can reveal it
to the camera but Luke can't know the
brilliance of my plan this will be the
happiest computer that ever existed to
be very careful with this thing because
it does stuff that I really don't want
him to know it does so that's gonna stay
there and I need these guys okay so this
my friends is the key the secret
ingredient yes that is over three pounds
of glitter three pounds
garbage-can haughtiness is key I didn't
know it did that okay well that's fine
so like any masterfully constructed
build it starts with the motherboard and
I do have some very interesting plans
for the motherboard we really don't have
a lot of time for some of the stuff that
I am so this module I don't really think
I'm actually going to be able to use
this will all be used as snow so all can
go right in there or wherever else I do
decide to place it so basically I'm just
harvesting these things I guess I guess
this doesn't need to be a super secret
anymore so let's see yeah I don't even
know if that sound can end up in the
video probably not it's tech showdown
not make the most obnoxious computer
showdown this is gonna be like you know
that that thing that goes on in front of
a ship a lot of times it's like a lady
or a horse or whatever this will be my
version of that so it's going to go
right up here I'll see if I can show you
guys I don't know how I'm exactly going
to fix it there yet but it's gonna go
right there I think that looks classy
though so we'll figure that out later
uh-huh maybe a little bit more classy
than three pounds of glitter but I don't
know we'll see glitters as classy as it
gets I am really not sure how quickly
I'm going to be able to put all this
together okay this looks like a prime
candidate for some gussied up if you
know what I mean bright orange paint
right being paint everything we do is
primer or fluorescent orange pink yellow
or green what did I do
well I'm kind of at a stop
okay I have no idea where the screws
from my case are I'm gonna waste my
whole three hours just trying to find
these screws can I even do anything with
them the threads for the spare screws
that I had do not match I have literally
no idea at all
where the screws for my case are so I
don't really know what to do so I just
found the accessories box for another
case it's supposed to be rail mounted in
here because it has rail mount things on
here it did not come with mine so I'm
still trying to find motherboard
standoffs and stuff can't even start see
it's supposed to be the drive rail right
here the key to any successful paint job
is masking so this will be our
experiment this is where we're going to
find out if this is going to work at all
sure just avert your eyes oh man
how does this work okay so it goes on
kind of a little something like that
sure I guess you just kind of go ham I'm
getting it on my hands that's hopefully
fine immediately sprinkle on the
decorations and allow to dry oh what the
crap it's closed
oh no okay
I'm sure all the crafty people in our
audience are telling me how much better
I could be doing this right now okay I
think I'm getting the hang of this you
just you put the thing on and then you
put the okay there we go
I'm liking that I did it the wrong color
no I'm doing these guys this is why I
want to put the power supply in because
we have special cables from cable mod
and these oh they do look awesome check
this out yeah those are great
hey we are in business here so I'm
trying to tape his hat to that cable
hoping that uh I can make him actually
stay there that's more like it focusing
on sparkle power and the last thing I
want is for any of this to not look
tasteful
yep think we've got our technique down
cable management is crap but they
shouldn't be able to see this so I don't
really care I'm a little bit worried
because I think mine is going to come
out more refined looking and his is
going to come out more balls-to-the-wall
looking and I think that really might
come down to what the judges decide and
that scares so this one we're going for
the red it is very very fortunate that
I'm a genius and thought to set up this
canopy here because my project relies
very heavily on the tasteful application
of glitter anyone's ever poking around
behind the warehouse they're gonna
wonder why all the rocks Sparkle alright
move on right away right away with the
red with the tasteful red she put this
on my plenty of fish profile I know my
way around a glitter bottle wait why do
you have a plenty don't worry about it I
had to meet my wife somehow so what were
you thinking updating well you never
know I might need to meet a new life
somehow no way they do tasteful in my
ass
how's it look I'm thinking about putting
maybe the one that's on the left here
and the one that's on the right here as
left and right along these side columns
I think that could look pretty cool so I
try to be that so brandon pointed out
that of course there is a grid on the
back of the wrapping paper so just like
the bomb when I had to draw or cut
something out I have no idea what I'm
doing those edges are way more straight
now which is good it's much more clean
is it seriously too short it's too short
what a waste of time okay this is
starting to come along it's still not
perfect for sure but it is starting to
come along I need to fold this thing
over and then cut it the next side will
go a lot faster than this because now I
kind of get how to do it if this seems
like a very weird oh man
I might have to ditch the this idea I
don't think it's going to work again I
think I'm just going to move on the
front is fine it's not great but it's
fine
so I mean we wanted something else just
make sure that I can get everything done
so if glitter were to get into the slots
on the motherboard which it won't
because I'm a professional that would
potentially be an issue yes this is the
professional way to remove the excess
glitter from your hands now I have shiny
butt so I'm gonna do my patented work on
a motherboard from the underside with a
counterweight technique this time I will
not be using Titan X's as my
counterweight allows want to
I have taken enough flak for using Titan
X's as counterweights in my time Wow
look at that if you're not having the
experience of how awesome that is maybe
you need it from my angle oh you're
getting blueberry we all knew that was
going to happen well you said it was
supposed to be precise it's very precise
calm down very precisely everywhere I
intend it to be where did that screwball
okay so I just realized we've used 1/3
of our time already
I might do a full thing across the whole
panel what if we just give it a wreath
now
I'm getting rather close actually - this
being ready to go huh
I think that's all right that works
better than thought I would okay nice I
think I like that more than the other
one actually don't have a plan for the
pipe cleaners I was just walking through
the store and I kind of saw it and I was
like oh wow those are amazing I must
have them if I could get sort of a candy
cane effect I think that would be quite
tasteful so I have an idea for how I
would do that I'm really not sure if
it's going to work though
late I had not considered how to mask
off okay hold on hold on just just wait
just wait okay okay hold on hold on hold
on hold on hold on everyone just wait
just wait okay actually freaking out a
little bit right now what am I going to
use for this I just need something to I
need something to cover that side while
I'm spraying a divider so wish me luck
oh oh I oh I contaminated my cell oh
crap
I'm supposed to do that Bob closed
through the silver over here this may
yet work no guarantees but this may yet
work
oh my goodness this is the stupidest
thing I've done that's not bad
oh it's beginning to look a lot like he
doesn't know what he's doing but he's
gonna fake it all the way I don't think
there's any getting around this I think
the whole thing has to come apart so I
better move fast yeah Lincoln green for
the body red for the backplate silver
horses are Christmassy he's trying to
distract me but I'm not going to let him
do it unlike some people I have an
awesome build to complete yeah exactly
pretty awesome that's not what I said I
didn't need a qualifier with mine so I
secured the back and the front now I'm
just trying to like hide the method that
I use for securing it because it looks
really ghetto
man these are going to shine oh okay oh
oh super balls come on okay that is not
a good approach
yeah spectacular trying to get some of
the glitter off knife and hands oh
that's cold man that's cold okay that's
cool I feel like if I can finish I have
a shot at this
okay so we're gonna go green around the
borders and red or for the spinning fan
in the middle silver this is kind of
centerpiece of the build and Silver's
kind of the you know the tertiary
Christmas colors so we get right on the
fan hug there that's important actually
oh that looks great kind of a snowy like
not quite covered effect on the top I'm
liking that so this is a glitter spray
instant sparkle finish quick drying a
flower sake wow that is that is a very
subtle bitter effect
yeah
see I'm going frantically as well but I
actually cared about the aesthetics of
mine allow them to appreciate it a
little bit better
you're just so 40 this whole sides just
black
hey we're walking this way no not that
doors what logs how to tell you tell me
he's not allowed to look now they moved
right yeah go go go go
you got to look over I didn't see now
that is enough oh my god
this is so shiny look at this I like the
Snoopy would you look is that Snoopy
that's it I I can't help that's actually
Snoopy or just a knockoff I like this
one okay so is it possible for the fan
to even work with all that's my question
how well is that is it kind of ooh howls
that stuff's new it's not it's not this
is glitter as the hurtness of the craft
well it's gonna be only like lace red
and green not some sparkle on the top
are we judging oh it is oh I hope they
appreciate the attention to detail yeah
doing the stripe ponent of my of my
graphics the striping on the oh my god
this thing's too shut up the striping on
the graphics card is insane
oh you mean the power spike foot yes sir
sir sir
yeah so that candy cane effect when it
took up way to like there's a few things
I did that took way too long they gonna
wear this way but it would they would
still the parts would still I'm assuming
these systems actually work yeah but
sneakers pretty cool look they both so
they both use cable mod for red and
green yeah I really like that s know
they they but I they probably posted
that independently you know I mean I
really I gotta say I like this one a lot
better video yeah this one I mean they
both used to cable it's just glitter it
is all glitter oh so not all there's no
power supply is glittery yeah no not all
that
Oh smashmouth okay so three person would
it be so wrong for me to plug this in
and turn it on and get glitter all over
the place no we're not it'll be visually
interesting you know what we should use
that as part of our judges ramen so I
get so hot okay
like melt okay I'm gonna go fine that's
an interesting line that's a pretty
interesting point
keep going burqa I thought this was
gonna go the other way I thought John
was gonna go from line and Burkle is
gonna go for yours
well mine's also not as tacky as we
assumed it would be that's true that's
very true if I had done the entire
outside I really want all I run it
through the outside I don't even know if
they've noticed the subtle like glitter
frosting that's on my fangirls borrow up
okay y'all ready for this Dan and in it
yeah oh my god let's bring the camera he
is going everywhere all right is this
gonna destroy the hardware it should be
Oh - oh there's even glitter on the fans
on this GPU my god this is oh they
stopped spinning that's fine they're
stops - mm - I suppose squeaks is that
one spinning good see thank the distance
there he's like oh they're not supposed
to be spinning they're everywhere oh
that's fancy fancy fancy glitter means
good hay Burkle's coming around to me
yeah dyed fan woods with people's was
yeah like wow the chipset is this yeah
glitter I did each component of the
motherboard separately that's why the
motherboard took so long yeah yeah yeah
well Oh seemed to work okay it does seem
to work nor did it just make some
internet switch these are practical I
wonder if someone checked if it was
exhausting your letter to the back
probably okay uh what what do we like
about the glitter one graphics card
graphics card day I like the nice
juxtaposition of different colors Jen
come on guy
oh look the Justin position of the
different colors
Slater like where the i/o panel is is
silver and it's a same thing I'll GPU
have right here green here in silver all
the fans you know what I think this is
lionesses because what what like guy in
his 20s who doesn't have a way for kids
knows how to use glitter properly I
think this is a leak so I think this is
what I mean is this is this properly
play I don't know that looks pretty
problem is gone there's no so much that
are skip it will it's more than the
whole effect strikes me as a little bit
messy you know yes yes you're supposed
to be coming up with things they like
right now I think the execution on a
plan to glitter itself could it better I
would not have put it on the fans that's
what I don't like they should not get on
the fan I like more like okay okay the
negative from Taryn is literal over the
place yeah I'm negative know a little
place till he turned it on the outside
lack of oh yeah it's like one side goes
around your house ah yeah yeah okay what
do we like about it but okay yeah Terry
um glitter I like the glitter I just
don't like that it's gonna get all over
the place I would have gone way toned
down and I would have actually done a
lot turning this into what you don't
like with you lying about us I don't
know it's kind of funny because even
though like I said the overall effects a
little bit messy there's clearly there's
clear some time and thought that went
into this with how whoever's this is we
think Linus's but where there's put the
colors together so yeah thanks John oh
this one I don't number two what do we
like about it
your mom ah I mean I don't know I I like
that it's more of a more this doesn't
sound great so far it's pretty tacky but
at the same time it's Christmas a little
packing us yeah I like the tackiness
I like the snow yeah I like that it
might light on fire if it has to
sometimes you got a actually be fire
hazard does seem more likely with this
for fire house more fitting with
Christmas
Tony host yeah you have that cotton
right next to the power supply though I
read it like the world time hotel
wouldn't drive but the power supply fan
is facing down it goes out yeah I still
makes me nervous it makes me a little
nervous too but it's not as bad as it
could be imagine they put the cotton up
here that will be a lot worse I think
okay maybe there's some thought yeah
well for me is the attention to detail
here you look at this case compared to
the first one almost every part of the
case and of the bill ties into the theme
somehow you have quit working on both
sides juice is very waters boy do you
see this side that's what you're going
to look at you have green here you have
green here it's a very nice effect even
inside the case you look at the choices
of components even beyond the obviously
Christmasy stuff you have like red heat
spreaders on the RAM it goes with the
rest of it that's really interesting
figures it out Aaron figured out he's
like they both have the same components
I'm thinking my negative would be
there's like three different hues of
green on here you know they could have
put a little more detail into that but
then again that is kind of tacky and
that does make it kind of fun uh would I
like to see a little more glitter oh you
just got points deducted for not enough
glitter ha ha ha
what Wow that is ridiculous that is
fantastic ristmas II think y'all wait
when it's red gram silver it is I mean
the colors were right like a here's a
Christmas bow yeah that doesn't yeah
glitter Oh fine all right well is it
time for us to reveal our glitter bit
gathers belet's nor reveal time now
right okay so on the count of three we
reveal our cards okay one two three okay
there's that six five four the loop so
19 out of 30 for the liveability okay
okay and now the next one present bill
show them
oh no the presents was the present one
yes yes yes mine was the prison bill
yeah it was me so the present ill by two
points we got I guess the glitter was
yeah I heard Furcal say I don't know
what guide is 22 naughty girls like oh
I'm just saying I don't I learned a lot
I like I I still chose the glitter as
the winner I like that glitter so let us
know guys in the comments below do you
want to see more text showdowns want to
suggest some themes perhaps drop a like
on this video if you thought mine was
the best but it's funny cuz a lot of
people won't watch to this point and
they'll just like it cuz they liked it
and as always don't forget to subscribe
