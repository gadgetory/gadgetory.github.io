there who ran out and bought two of
invidious collector's edition Titan XP
Star Wars graphics cards for a total of
twenty four hundred dollars to run an
SLI and that is that the new Titan V
which will actually outperform that
configuration in many games for just
$600 more doesn't have any Star Wars
branding on it whatsoever so as long as
you buy your card purely for Star Wars
and not for performance you should feel
pretty good right now
okay now technically this box has
already been opened because Anthony is
already hard at work on our full review
of this card but I still wanted to go
through the unboxing experience with you
guys because damn it I spent $3,000 on
this graphics card so I intend to milk
it to the fullest extent that I can and
to that end nope not working okay here
we go so it comes with some
documentation including a QuickStart
guide and a support guide that's
actually unusual for these well right
this isn't a sample card I was gonna say
the samples never come with these okay
that's not very interesting Titan VIII
support guide okay that's not very
interesting either it also comes with
one of these not sure what it is yet but
it better be gold just like the card
because if I'm gonna spend $3,000 on a
graphics card everything should be
silver silver DisplayPort to DVI adapter
okay if I intended to do that is a good
shot alright
and then we've got it right here the
Titan V graphics card so what do they
have to say for themselves oh right
5120 cuda cores so
compared to the Titan XP which is an
incredibly powerful card in its own
right that's got 3840 CUDA cores so we
are expecting this to be 20-25 percent
faster right out of the gate then it has
the same amount of memory 12 gigs but
it's using HBM to memory so that is much
much faster which may or may not have a
ton of applicability in gaming but will
definitely help with the Titan V's
intended use case which is apparently
like deep learning a I and really the
same kinds of workloads as in videos
v100 as in videos v 100 the only card
that they've got on the market already
using this same Volta architecture now
you guys might be looking at $3,000
graphics card here going well that's an
unreasonable amount of money and I would
be inclined to agree with you but
compared to that Tesla view 100 it's
actually less than a third of the price
with much of the same capability so it
is a little bit slower and as you can
see here the NV link fingers that you
probably saw previously when we showed
off the GP 100 are actually covered and
to our knowledge they are disabled so it
does not support envy link but other
than that for someone working on you
know an AI type workload on a desktop
this aims to be the ultimate experience
with all that said you guys want to see
it game I'm sure so so I'm gonna say the
detailed run-through of our entire test
suite for Anthony's review but I still
want to have a quick look at how the
Titan VIII compares to the Titan XP so
here's the settings we're using in GTA 5
3840 by 2160 I will change that to
fullscreen but in terms of what settings
were using FXAA very high or high sort
of across the board here tessellation
high and then all the advanced stuff
turned on so I've already got my numbers
for the ty
next P let's go ahead and shut this baby
down and get a new graphics card
installed you know I gotta say I am NOT
a huge fan of the gold ID it really
smacks of well apples doing it but not
in a tasteful way like this is by far
invidious tackiest looking graphics card
in the last you know three four years
anyway really ugly like what and it's
like I realize this is maybe seemingly
insignificant complaint for something
that's designed for professional use and
is you know capable of gaming but is
really a professional card but at this
kind of price it should be perfect there
it is there's our Titan V powered up for
the first time ever only three thousand
US dollars I think it included free
shipping though so here we go
the first image its ever output it's
like when we think about how long we're
actually gonna use this card because we
bought it strictly for a comparative
testing like benchmarking against other
things like it's costing me you know a
dollar per minute to run it so I'm gonna
take it in I need a drink no water left
it's out for solid water
come on alright so I'm just dialing in
my settings here because grand theft
auto is a giant piece of crap when it
comes to actually remembering what you
want fly and benchmark jet benchmark
tests I haven't actually looked at any
results that are online yet so this will
be my first experience Titan XP who's
still warming versus Titan V Wow listen
to that coy line you hear that
listen to it went so there's a black
screen right now listen to it when I
hear all getting close it's kind of
crazy to think that we've gotten to the
point though we're running Grand Theft
Auto at 4k at very high settings is
maybe not demanding enough to see a huge
separation between graphics cards we
might even be CPU limited a little bit
here even though I'm running a 59 60 X
Extreme Edition all right so oh wow
okay so just so you guys know this is
where you're looking wow that is not
better so we can't draw any really
concrete conclusions right now this is
one game at one resolution against one
other card and one set of in-game
settings but what we can say for certain
is that right now the Titan V is not a
great value compared even to in videos
Titan XP which is not a great value
compared to the 1080 Ti with that said
the word on the street is that Nvidia is
planning an architecture that's sort of
based on some of the same principles as
volta but that doesn't have some of the
deep learning like tensor core stuff
built into it so that it can be a little
bit less expensive and hopefully we're
gonna see that sometime in 2018
but for now Titan V is not a card for
gamers as expected so thanks for
watching this unboxing and lesson on
buyer's remorse is it a lesson did we
learn anything anyway if you're just
like the video you can hit that button
but if you liked it hit like get
subscribe maybe consider checking out
where to buy the stuff we featured if
you're like a deep learning scientist at
the link in the video description also
down there is our merch storage house
