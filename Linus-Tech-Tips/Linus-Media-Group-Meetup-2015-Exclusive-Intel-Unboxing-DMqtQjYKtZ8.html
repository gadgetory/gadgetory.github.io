yes so we're either gonna be unboxing
this please one of the big ones
from LG mall no it depends all the
viewers know or we have two boxes from
Intel
can you guys obtain a table yeah yeah
okay I'll just entertain okay just going
to do like a loudness thing so everyone
who watched the LG box just pick noise
okay intel box can I have a volunteer
hi everyone so unfortunately I don't
spend enough time with you guys but I
can clearly see that was a mistake
because now that we finally didn't lead
up we have a vote holy crap it must be
over 200 people here I think it's over
9000 the thing we are doing now is a
live unboxing mystery box from Intel I
legitimately do not know what is inside
and we're gonna love it what I also know
is that it was so gigantic and amazing
it needed two boxes not just one turned
up and everything side it also comes
with special instructions for unboxing
it and they have warned me and I'm gonna
I'm gonna read this to you guys verbatim
because it's kind of hilarious give me a
second to pull out my email well this is
great I have a new email from him saying
attention box issues you guys you guys
might get to see a problem today okay
you let there be no just a higher table
thank you can I take it all the way down
first can I stand on it while you hold
it'll make me feel more magnificent oh
wow actually supports whoa
alright step number one okay you might
want to roll this separately because
this will actually be an upload today
step number one set up your camera and
other recording equipment for an optimal
filming experience vahana
optionally gather around 300 or more of
your close friends
this red zoos the Intel box Master
System fun for the whole family nothing
with immersive color and able
interactivity haha where's your magic
box inside okay that's that's a case box
who wants it move
alrights on the back we've got it
classic classic until logo with the
subscript e we've got a part number
that's obviously pure nonsense at the
back we've got a power plug that is
obviously not going to do anything wow
that genuine wood veneer paneling
hold on hold on I have to follow the
instructions follow the instructions
okay step three open the lid using the
dual cloud system here we go you guys
ready
hello we can cut this out right why
don't I check that second email about
the problem welcome to the behind the
scenes now it actually goes down some of
the packages may have been damaged by
shipping if you can try to gently slide
the section with the buttons forward
towards you it should slide off if you
force it a little it's supposed to be
locked but the lock can be forced with a
little pressure no pressure again hey
okay hey ah you didn't even have to open
it ah so there's good patrol battle
venta oh I see what they need the
backing is actually bulged they were
saying it could be damaged by heat
during shipping so uh
oh that's shame
so the first item in size like these you
know yes it is a core i7 6700k but does
more there's more it is an Intel solid
eight seven
400 gigs of it now let's find out what
is inside the second box Jackie hi it's
another board I don't want the packing
peanuts to go on yet so fast forward in
time and we have replaced the roaring
crowd with an Intel box master system
that actually works unfortunately our
first one was damaged in shipping
leading to no small amount of
embarrassment on my part now we get to
try it for real so there are two buttons
power and reset uh-huh okay oh okay it's
a game puzzle so it looks like the
advertisement about the polar rescue and
ten and two extreme games was not
actually correct I did a bit of
misleading advertising Vera whoever the
manufacturer of the Master System is
here but this could be fun anyway now I
obviously got instructions on how to do
this which is sort of sort of like
buying me like you know the the guide
you know that they like the game fax you
know thing well they we used to have to
buy those guides now you just go on
gamefaqs comm um so that's pretty much
it it unlocks it and inside you find a
core i7 6700 K quad core hyper threaded
LGA 1151 processor so that will fit into
an LGA 1151 motherboard that's using the
z1
70 chipset all the latest
state-of-the-art cool stuff we're
actually going to have an overclocking
guide cunning because even though this
chip runs at four gigahertz 4.2 boost I
would expect based on the results on the
other side of that door yes this is a
strong hint I would suspect that you
could get somewhere closer to four point
seven plus gigahertz on this puppy also
inside is the latest Intel 750 series
SSD so this is a 400 gig variant PCI
Express variant of their
state-of-the-art SSD which we actually
have a review of that looked it up a
couple of months back when this baby
launched and the last thing that was
included in our last box but wasn't
inside the Master System box is a quad
channel kit of Corsair Vengeance lpx
ddr4 memory so that is 16 gigs of
basically the fastest consumer-grade
memory you can get because yes LGA 1151
bringing ddr4 to the mainstream so there
you go guys
that was a fun little game that we
played very zelda-esque
and without further ado let's get into
our sponsor spot for the day so Linus
ENCOM is the place to be if you want to
find a mobile carrier that actually
answers the phone when you call them
it's kind of funny if you think about it
mobile you know carriers they provide
phones they provide phone lines and yet
when you go to call them it seems like
they have no phones and they have no
phone lines they just have robots well
maybe what they should do is they should
sell you a subscription for four robots
like let's say for example you got to
decide ahead of time we'll see I'm gonna
need 40 robots a month and some of them
should be long-distance robots and the
others should be you know this and if I
don't use that many I have to pay for
them anyway no not at ting add 10 you
pay only for the text messages data and
voice that you use who use their savings
calculator that's over at Linus ENCOM
can't emphasize that enough to find out
if you will save money by switching to
ting not only that but if you use our
offer code Wu you get another $25 in
credit and if you're on a contract
already they will cover I think it's up
to $75 off of your existing contract
cool stuff so for full details
