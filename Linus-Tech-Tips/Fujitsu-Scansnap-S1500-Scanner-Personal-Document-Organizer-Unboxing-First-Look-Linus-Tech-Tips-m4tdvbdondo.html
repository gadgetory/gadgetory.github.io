at first like it would have much
application to the everyday consumer
because it is a 500 plus dollar scanner
but it actually has some pretty
compelling things about it that might
make you want to add a fujitsu scansnap
to your home so I actually already
opened this up off camera but well I had
someone else opened it up and was
working on setting it up but I have not
seen the contents yet so why don't we
start by just getting it opened up and
I'll talk about some of the features as
we go and after the fact so first we
have our AC adapter so that's pretty
pretty run-of-the-mill
next we have some packing materials also
pretty run-of-the-mill and finally we
have the scansnap
itself which is not run-of-the-mill and
I will explain what actually really
heavy bear just put that down this is
not a portable scanner although it does
have a very small form factor so it will
easily fit on your desk next we have a
carrier sheet so I'll explain what the
carrier sheet does in a moment as well
but let's just finish up the unboxing
side of things so this is a what is it
eight and a half by fourteen I believe
carrier sheet alright and then finally
we have a couple more accessories so
this guy right here this is a demo eval
checklist so your retailer and it won't
come with one of those and finally we
have a skin snap setup DVD ROM as well
as a USB cable and a power cable to plug
into the AC adapter so give me a couple
seconds because I am going to use a
cheat sheet for this so I'm gonna kind
of hide it a little actually you know
what let's just get started so this is
the scans not s 1500 so why don't we
start with that carrier sheet I'm sorry
that was 11 by 17 it can be Kate give me
a sec guys
so let's do the overall physical layout
of the scans now that's 1500 so you lift
it up like this that's all pretty
straightforward you pull it up like that
you can load in whatever documents use v
so if it's for the sake of for the sake
of demonstration why don't we take our
carrier sheet which is just a clear
plastic film
that closes over a damaged document it
can also be used rather creatively I
might add to scan pages that are up to
11 by 17 by folding them in half over
the carrier sheet and the software
itself will automatically stitch it
together so there you go
that's how you load a page onto it you
press scan in order to scan it now
there's almost nothing in terms of
buttons on the scan snap itself you can
see up the front there's no buttons
there's just the output for the paper or
documents that you have scanned on the
side there's pretty much nothing on the
other side pretty much nothing on the
bottom pretty much nothing and on the
back okay hold on there's a couple
things on the back so on the back we
have the DC input as well as the USB
input so there you have it that is the
physical characteristics of the S 1500
now most of the magic is in the software
and if you've ever bought a scanner and
tried to use it in the past you'll know
that the software can be a bit of a bear
it'll make or break a scanner because it
can have the best image quality in the
world but if the software crashes on you
every 30 seconds which I have
experienced in the past then that's not
gonna do you any good so let's go
through the features I'm totally gonna
use my cheat sheet here and I'm very
sorry guys but there's a lot of
different points that I didn't want to
cover so it scans both sides of the
document that you run through it okay it
can correct for things like upside-down
pages if your document is accidentally
running through a little bit crooked now
it does have guides here so you can
adjust it to different sizes of paper
but just in case it does run through a
little bit crooked by accident it will
actually automatically correct that
it'll automatically remove blank pages
it'll auto crop according to the
document type so a4 checks business
cards and this is all stuff you can
control in the software you can actually
scan to text and you can make it a
searchable PDF so if you were to take a
text document Excel sheets actually
don't work all that well but if you were
to take a more text heavy document and
scan it through here it'll automatically
convert all of that text to a searchable
PDF which is pretty cool because it
means that if you're ever trying to find
a check from your work for example if as
long as you scan all your stubs through
here all you have to do is search for it
and you can bring up all of the checks
in one go so here we go one click can
okay give me a sec guys
now along the lines of the the scannable
searchable text if you take your
document and you actually highlight
certain text so let's say you
highlighted anything to do with with a
stove RNA that you were dealing with for
the longest time so you just highlight
stove on any document that you scan
through it and you can actually set it
to automatically create metadata so you
can create tags for that document based
on anything that you highlight it which
makes it very easy to index things
according to and organized according to
what it was actually for you can also do
highlighter cropping so if you are where
to cut out something with a highlighter
and you set it in the software it'll
automatically crop that document
according to the section you highlighted
which is pretty neat as well works fine
on photos although it is by design a
document scanner it has the resolution
it has the color accuracy to do photos
no problem and all of that auto
orientation stuff and all those
correction type things will work on
photos as well it scans directly into
iPhoto but the included Fujitsu software
is PC oriented so it is more of a PC
product than a Mac product so stay away
from the dislike button you guys it has
replacement parts for the feeders so hey
there you go hey there's something I
missed I knew it would have somewhere
for the ugly there we go so now we can
see it works a little bit better ok so
you actually okay but have you guys ever
had a gravity-fed printer that starts to
take out two pages at a time or stops
taking out pages at all you've probably
encountered this in the past Fujitsu
actually allows you to replace the
rubber pieces replace the feeders
according to when they need to be
replaced you don't actually have to buy
a new scanner so they do inventory those
parts you can get them you don't have to
just throw it away like you do with most
printers
so there you go now that makes a lot
more sense that they fold separately
compact doesn't it that's cool
let's do it one more time there we go
okay finally business cards it'll do
business cards as long as they're not on
a black background which most of them
aren't
it'll do business cards in a wide
variety of different languages and it'll
organize them for you it'll scan all the
text so all you have to do in terms of
your rolodex is have a scan snap that
you run all your business cards through
and then just search by name or by
company name whatever the case may be on
your computer and it'll take care of all
that for you as well so this is my
unboxing of the fujitsu scansnap I
actually have a tech tips episode coming
up on this once I've spent some more
time with the unit because you can see
this is my very first run at it right
now and thank you for checking out my
