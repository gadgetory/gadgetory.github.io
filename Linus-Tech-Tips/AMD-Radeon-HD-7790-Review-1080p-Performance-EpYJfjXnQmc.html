visit www.samhsa.gov/dtac us a little
while to get our hands on this card so
we weren't able to get one until msi got
us a 77 9000 seed or natto seed or 902
onenote or whatever else it happens to
be we overclocked every card we get our
hands on anyway and we keep them all
within sort of a reasonable overclocking
expectation like you could probably get
something close to those settings if you
follow the usual procedure for
overclocking and so yeah we don't really
sort of worry too much about any of that
so let's start with our overall test
platform we've got a 3930k which is
overclocked to 4 gigahertz we've got a
p9 x79 deluxe motherboard 16 gigs of
Kingston HyperX memory a course our H
100 liquid cooler to handle that
overclocked 6 core and then Tec hcp
thousand watt power supply is 80 +
Platinum a 128 gig vertex 4 SSD and last
but not least the graphics cards which
vary so the one that we have left on
here right now I believe is our 7870
Hawk yes that is indeed the card we have
so we are going to be using our usual
methodologies for all the games you see
we're going to put annotations next to
them as each game comes up to let you
guys know how you can replicate our
results so you can take your own
hardware and see if you can produce the
same sort of benchmark run which you
should be able to and you can compare
your own hardware to what you're using
so without any further ado we're going
to launch into our first game so
BioShock Infinite is a very new very
exciting title and it looks like the 77
90 / formed about 10-12 percent worse
than the GTX 650 Ti boost now both of
these cards launched at almost the same
time the 650 ti boost came in right
after the 77 90 had had a great launch
and was very disruptive because it
wasn't much more expensive it had 2 gigs
of ram whereas the stock 77 90 had one
however you can get it in to gig
configurations and it yeah it wasn't
that much more expensive so the 77 90 is
kind of like an amped-up 77 70 or a 77
or 78 50 that's been been crippled a
little bit you can see it falls right
exactly in between those two cards and I
mean a little bit under the 650 TI booth
so everything performs pretty much
exactly where it should we ran all of
our tests at 1080p as per our usual
procedure especially for cards like this
that are intended to be run at 1080p so
for far cry 3 we found that the 77 90
performs pretty much right in line with
the GTX 650 Ti boost this makes sense I
mean this I consider a win for the 77 90
because it's only a one gig card and
because it did manage to perform the
same and you can see that we've taken
cards the next cards up and the next
cards down from both the green and the
red team so you can see how those
compare the 7770 still does quite well
only performing about 20% lower than the
77 90 and the 650 really didn't put in
put up a very good fight at all in this
one for Metro 2033 you see the 7770
looks really good the 77 90 looks a
little bit better than that and the 650
ti boost looks a little bit better than
that which is pretty much exactly where
we'd expect them to fall however we can
still kind of call this a win for the 77
90 because the 650 ti boost it doesn't
perform better enough to justify its
additional cost with that said the 650
ti boost only really gets the benefit
from that extra memory which does cost
more to manufacture when you actually
require it so when the textures of the
game fill up one gig v ran and can
overflow it to the point where it'll
cripple that card's performance in
witcher 2 we saw what may be an example
of that where the 77 9 you really didn't
perform that much better than a 77 70
only about 10% whereas the 650 ti boost
pulled out significantly away from both
of them by about 15% but again hard to
say how much of that is the actual power
of the GPU and how much is the
additional V ran the 650 really trailed
in this one in the 77 70 put up a pretty
good fight finally our last game is
Crysis 3 but can it run Crysis and the
answer is yes it's it's pretty much
exactly where it belongs within the
product stack in this one and there
are no surprises there so what does all
this mean well depending on your budget
if you want to spend 150 dollars plus or
minus get a seventy seven ninety if you
wanted to spend a little bit more than
that maybe about 175 bucks you can get a
650 TI boost both of them are an
excellent value and if you wanted to
spend even less than that the 7770
continues to be our light weight
champion at only around 120 bucks and
giving you most of the performance of
the next tier up of cards and much
better than what the Green Team has to
put forward at that price point which
was the GTX 650 at 115 dollars now we
take all of our pricing as the second
lowest price on NCI XCOM to give you
guys some ideas so if you kind of go oh
well the retailer near me these prices
I'll go okay yes they do that's fine
but that's not our methodology for
taking pricing and comparing these cards
so in conclusion the 77 90 offers up not
much in terms of surprises it does
support eyefinity it does have excellent
power efficiency as well as quiet
operation and you get what you pay for
