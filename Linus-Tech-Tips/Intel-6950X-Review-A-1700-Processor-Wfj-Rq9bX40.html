what we do in the do-it-yourself PC
community is because we can and that's
not always a bad thing especially if you
just want to throw in some sick looking
lighting or something like that but
today we're talking about CPUs
specifically Intel's new Broadwell II
enthusiasts line even though CPU cores
have become a little like cylinders in
your city only cruising sedans engine
where the only point in having a v12 is
they screw you I have 12 cylinders intel
is hoping that its new top-end 10 core
behemoth with a price to match will be a
hit with those who need top-end
performance so let's take a look at it
and the rest of the Broadwell Uihlein
and see if it's more than just a status
symbol for techies
the GTX tennety amp Xtreme from ZOTAC
features their ice storm cooler with
triple 90 millimeter eco fans for better
airflow and heat extraction check out
the link below to learn more so it's
been almost two years since we've gotten
a new line of enthusiast processors from
Intel the main thing that sets these
CPUs apart from their mainstream
brethren is the inclusion of more cores
and the inclusion of more RAM slots
Broadwell II is no exception the bottom
two chips on the latter the core i7 6800
K and 68 50 K are each hexa core with
the latter providing 40 PCI Express
Lanes instead of 28 while the 69 hundred
K features eight cores and 16 threads
meaning it's essentially a direct
replacement for the previous toppdogg
the i7 59 60 X but if you want to go all
out the new chip sitting at the top of
the heap is the 69 50 X featuring 10
cores and 20 threads the most that intel
has ever packed into an enthusiast class
cpu of course it shouldn't be surprising
that since Intel is trying to set 10
cores as the new gold standard for
desktops consumers will pay a hefty
premium the chips MSRP is over seventeen
hundred US dollars enough to build an
entire high-end gaming rig with
peripherals that would be like pretty
good and all you're really getting for
the $600 premium over the roughly $1100
sixty nine hundred K other than the X
and the model number that is important
to some people are to more cores and an
extra five megabytes of cache and even
then you take an overall hit on clock
speed now huge price jumps for more
cores isn't exactly new for 2ne1 but
spending that much for two more cores
when you're already at eight and then
taking a hit in the speed department is
Fe especially at that cost our best
guess is that Intel priced at this high
to keep part of their xeon line from
being cannibalized by the highest and
core i7s as many xeon SKUs have ten
cores and we'll work on consumer grade
x99 motherboards but
or the average home PC builder how can
anything actually justify forking this
much money over for well broad Raleigh
does come with a cool feature where the
core with the greatest overclocking
potential as determined by Intel the
factory is marked in the BIOS with an
asterisk so if you're running a heavily
single-threaded application and want the
best possible performance you can
overclock that core alone then in
windows until turbo boost 3.0 will
automatically set the affinity of that
application to that core specifically
making optimizing performance for single
threaded programs pretty easy but that
alone won't get most of you to spend
$1,700 especially as these features are
on all the broad well II SKUs not just
269 50 X and even then why are you
optimizing for single core applications
if you're buying one of these CPUs you
should probably be buying one of these
CPUs for definitely multi-threaded
applications as in single core they
don't do that great so speaking of which
let's talk about performance instead we
benchmarked all four broad well eat
chips on the X 99 Deluxe - from a soos
which features their new aura on board
RGB lighting for not only some cool
effects on the PCIe slots but also for
the rest of your rig which is pretty
cool as it has a header to allow board
lighting effects to sync with other case
lights you also get a u dot 2 and m dot
2 slots for higher-end nvme SSDs an
extra 4 pin connector for additional CPU
power and USB 3.1 support including a
type-c connector the rest of our
testbench consisted of 32 gigabytes of
corsair dominator ddr4 and h100 i GTX a
i/o a geforce gtx 1080 founders Edition
and a Kingston HyperX savage SSD we
tested the Broadwell e line against the
previous generation 5960 x as well as
the current skylake core i7 6700 k so we
instead use the a Suzy 170 deluxe for
the latter right off the bat it's pretty
fair to say that it's hard to justify
buying any bra
well echip if your heaviest work load
will be gaming as the $315 skylake 6700
K beat every single Broadwell e scue in
all of our gaming benchmarks including
the flagship 69 50 X even in cities
skylines which tends to be more CPU
bound than many other titles but of
course that's not surprising it's been
known for a long time that CPUs with
more than four cores see more utility on
the content creation side and with
things like file compression or
encryption here we see more threads and
cores benefiting in Cinebench 7-zip and
H dot 264 video rendering as well as in
Ida 64 AES encryption benchmark photo
editing benchmarks were a bit of a mixed
bag however which I 264 s Photoworks
benchmark favoring the higher core count
of Broadwell II but real benches GIMP
tests showed the skylake 6700 K pull
ahead on the single core tasks indeed
Cinebench is single core benchmark
showed the 6700 K well ahead of the
other four Broadwell II chips as well
but what about overclocking could
cranking up our clock speeds add more
value to the broad well a line we chose
to overclock the 6900 K since it's the
closest thing to a direct upgrade from
the older x-series skew we got our
review sample up to four point three
gigahertz or 300 megahertz over the
stock turbo boost unfortunately there
was a huge power and thermal penalty as
CPU cores shot up to 88 degrees Celsius
and we had to put 1.37 5 volts through
the processor to get it stable not
exactly ideal since the last gen
haswell-e series seemed to have a little
more headroom across the board
performance did increase notably in some
benchmarks with the overclock but single
core performance still lagged behind our
6700 K running at stock speeds so with
all of that said do any of these CPUs
really make any sense no doubt there are
real scenarios like three rendering or
really heavy encryption work where more
cores do matter
but from a price to performance
standpoint the 68-hundred que seems to
make the most sense since you're only
paying 120 dollars more than you would
for a 6700 K and get two extra
hyper-threaded cores and while it only
has 28 PCI Express lanes that might not
be as important as it used to be
especially as nvidia is no longer
supporting more than two graphics cards
in sli for gaming purposes and you'll
pay a hefty premium to upgrade to the
6850 k's 40 lanes I'm talking almost
another $200 so while broad well II
might be the ultimate thing for
enthusiasts to drool over right now I'd
rather spend my money on the glam that
won't spend its life hidden under a
water block even though that would
probably be pretty cool
today we're highlighting the k7 xx black
headphones of course from Mass drop and
they have a bunch of other cool products
that you can check out at the link in
the video description as well hopefully
you guys know about mass drop by now but
if not the concept is still pretty
simple the more people commit to a
purchase the more people that commit to
a certain price for a certain product
the lower the price of that product goes
these are the exact same ones that Lance
reviewed last a year and remember this
is a limited drop so if you want a pair
you're going to have to act pretty fast
these headphones were configured by mass
drop and manufactured by AKG so if you
want to check them out and grab a pair
of k7 xx headphones head over to the
link in the video description down below
thanks for watching guys if you liked
this video and you're like I'm going to
buy the 6800 or maybe just not an
enthusiast series one because I want to
play games cool if you dislike the video
cuz your life screw you I want ten cores
and I don't care about gaming
performance and I don't do anything else
with it anyways I just want ten cores
you can yeah you can do that if you want
to purchase one of the items featured in
this video check out Amazon if you want
to talk about the items featured in this
video check out the forum you become a
contributor there it doesn't really do a
ton but it's like cool and you get a
little badge thing and some people care
about those and there's also like a
member title thingy that shows up and
it's different
colors depending on what to don't worry
about it if you want to see our review
of the 6700 K check that out up here
gaming processor that's what it's
marketed for so that actually totally
makes sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
