Computex 2016 this year check out their
lap dog in the video description down
below you can game on the couch it's
pretty cool also thank you to msi we've
got videos from them coming very soon
last year Computex 2015 they announced
the freeform modular system and the
maker idea and people would be able to
make their own additions to these cases
and they would be coming out with their
own additions to these cases and you
could buy them online and mod your case
after the fact and that sounded super
cool but I wasn't entirely sure that
they were going to actually deliver and
I secretly gave them a one-year window I
said Computex 2016 in my head if they
didn't do it by then I would grill them
but they have so let's check it out
we're gonna start with the master case
maker 5 T the outside of it is the main
thing that I like but I do believe that
you will be able to buy this as a full
system I'm getting a nod from behind the
camera so that's fine but you can also
buy the individual bits for the outside
which is like the whole point of the
master case so if you wanted to add on B
handle that's on the top you would be
able to add that on to your master case
5 or the front or whatever or buy the
whole thing by itself if you haven't
bought a case yet I think this is great
I love handles whenever I look at a case
if I like it enough
I usually just wish that it had a handle
so if you have one of these and want to
upgrade they're not entirely sure what
color they're gonna do yet but they're
getting very good feedback on this deep
red and it will come in a color so send
them feedback on their Twitter handle
and let them know if that's the color
that you like and you can add a handle
to your case so the idea of the maker
hub is that they want people to go out
there and create custom additions to
their cases and then they want to help
them do so and then they want to buy the
items from them and resell them on their
store which is super cool because you
can get stuff like wheels for your case
so you can roll it around this was made
by havoc nation a group from India which
is pretty freakin cool
and you can even get stuff like Batman
symbols that have fans behind them to go
on the top because why not but it
doesn't stop at wheels and Batman logos
they even have really cool design stuff
like this from primo chill another
company actually which is absolutely
pretty interesting and they're its
specializing and bringing people
together part of the maker hub is
showing off the modders and what they do
where they came from how they got
inspired all that kind of stuff and
allowing them to connect so that they
can work on things together maybe and
make cool contributions to the entire
project and grow as a community they
have things like keyboard key caps as
well and custom things for your mice
there's tons of stuff and it's going to
constantly grow one of the reasons why
I'm not spending a whole bunch of time
on each individual one is you should
probably just go to the maker hub and
see what they currently have available
let me know what you guys think in the
comments down below is there something
that you saw here today that interests
you or is there something you want to
make for the maker hub or is there
something that you want made for you on
the maker hub anyways yeah comments down
below thanks to Coursera again for
sending us here check out their lapdogs
video description down below let's use a
full-sized keyboard and mouse on your
couch to play video games on your TV
pretty cool also thank you to MSI check
