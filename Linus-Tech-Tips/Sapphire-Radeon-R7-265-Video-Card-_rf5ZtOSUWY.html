DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts with its
Pitcairn core featuring a 256 bit memory
bus 1024 stream processors 2 gigs of DDR
5 memory and a 900 to 925 megahertz
clock speed depending on boost levels
the r7 265 is actually more closely
related to the r9 270 than to the r7
260x I might have already known this if
I paid attention to the lessons on
number rounding in elementary school but
even if I had it's not like we covered
our rounding works when the number also
contains a letter anyway at any rate the
card is closer inspect to 270 and closer
in price to a 260 X so that means our
sapphire dual X card should be a very
solid option from a price to performance
standpoint of course we've got support
for all the usual AMD features including
easy Eyefinity with no required
DisplayPort adapters crossfire with up
to two graphics cards working together
DirectX 11 now with a future upgrade to
DirectX 12 compatibility power to new
technology that keeps your power
consumption down and optimizes your
performance AMD's mantle technology and
finally excellent OpenCL performance
like most non reference cards the real
secret sauce here is the dual X cooler
this dual slot design is one that we've
actually seen before and it proved in
our testing and overclocking to be both
cool and quiet it features two thick
heat pipes directly over top of the GPU
core that each carry heat out to one of
the 280 millimeter fans and to a both
vrm cooling and card rigidity its power
delivery area heatsink is directly
attached to the cooler for the GPU core
a nice touch but of course me telling
you how great it is isn't as good as me
handing the video over to loupe to tell
you exactly how it stacked up in our
testing so without further ado I will
bid you adieu
alright guys this card performs pretty
much exactly as expected for the
overclockers out there I recommend using
AMD overdrive and inside of AMD
overdrive you'll probably get about
these settings so you're going to
increase your power limit by about 20%
move your core clock to 150 and memory
to 1500 that's an improvement on your
core clock of 125 it's also an
improvement on your memory of a hundred
which is pretty solid and again quite as
expected performance is at about the
same story so we're sitting right in
between a 260 and a 270 leaning more on
the 270 side of things and again that's
as expected as it's a lot closer to 270
but it's pretty impressive we knew this
was coming but it's a solid guy are you
still using this I me up okay I looked
it up a razor is for removing hair from
your face this is going to remove your
face from the hair I mean how long have
you had this thing for longer than I've
known you okay well that explains why
they kept trying to give you change on
that last trip that we were on I'm kind
of filming right now yeah and I know
that I scripted this whole thing well
that makes sense because I'm now using
my new razor from the Dollar Shave
couplet that you actually gave me and
it's working quite well that's not even
the line what the point is yes I did
give you that razor and I'm glad you
mentioned that speaking of Dollar Shave
Club it's the fast you inexpensive way
to save time and save money see what I
did there fast and inexpensive way to
save time and save money I'm a
redundancy with Dollar Shave Club for
only a few bucks a month you can have
top quality razor blades delivered right
to your door I mean this process looks
much more efficient than driving down to
the store waiting 18 minutes for an
employee to unlock the razor cartridge
for you then driving back home to remove
hair from your face head buttocks or any
other equally manly part of your body
speaking of manly there's nothing
unmanly about smelling nice so you
should check out their shave butter
while you're at it it softens the hair
is frizzy shaving and goes on clear so
you can see what you're doing thank you
and if your face is going to smell nice
you might as well make sure your butt
doesn't stink - one white Charlie's our
peppermint scented pre-moistened butt
wipes for me I mean men I think the line
is men it doesn't matter anyway visit
dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus to start
shaving time and shaving money instead
of shaving your facial features away
how's the new razor you have before X
right yeah good my work here is done
