desk upgrade but can't fit one in your
studio apartment well first things first
you should get that in checked out buddy
then when it turns out that it was just
some you know jock itch or whatever
second you should watch this video about
the vector desk mini it's a small sexy
desk PC case and we're going to show you
guys how to cram a full custom
water-cooling setup in it the master
Keys Pro keyboard lineup from
Coolermaster is available in three sizes
each in white or RGB flavours check them
out at the link below when we first laid
hands on the desk panels honestly they
felt disappointingly flimsy compared to
the premium expectations we had but then
we found out the price and given the
$500 price tag this can be fairly easily
forgiven instructions needed some work
even after considering the price though
the early version that we got was clear
enough for us to finish the build but
for novice computer builders some more
attention to the screw threading and the
positioning of the motherboard mounts
and small details like labels for the
screws and documentation for the
included storage mounting could smooth
out the process once the vector desk
mini actually reaches the market with
the desk assembled it's time to cram a
computer inside of it now this puppy is
designed for air cooling or AIO liquid
cooling but come on we weren't just
going to put your dad's Bell in here and
call it a day so we took aim at the more
accessible end of the enthusiast market
putting together the best multi-core
gaming and content creation machine we
could for a little over 2 grand without
water cooling parts these days no budget
high end builds kind of a new category
here
complete without an AMD rise in seven
cpu and their 1800 x8 core 16 thread
monster is the beating heart of hours on
an asus crosshair 6 hero motherboard
that gives us solid overclocking and
support for key technologies like sli
for multiple graphics cards MDOT to
storage for lightning-fast nvme SSDs and
of course system-wide RGB lighting to
keep that heart pumping at all times
we added a pump and lots of other water
cooling stuff as well courtesy of our
friends at ek and alpha cool custom loop
water cooling as we mentioned before
isn't officially supported by the vector
desk mini but we couldn't resist another
opportunity to use eks see-through
supremacy Evo cpu block and full covered
GPU block and thanks to the unique
fitting configuration on this alpha cool
XT 45 there seemed to be enough space to
do a really clean tidy setup in here and
we wanted our desk to be as quiet as
possible since it's like a foot and a
half from your face when you're using it
without compromising on cooling next we
chose 32 gigs of course there's
vengeance lpx ddr4 memory it's low
profile prevents it from interfering
with the tubing that we'll need to
install later after removing these
bizarre PCI covers we were able to mash
in the sexy EK water block equipped GTX
1080 that we had kitted out earlier now
the 1080 Ti might be the king of the
hill right now but the 1080 fits a
little bit better into the budget that
we're targeting we chose Corsairs RM
1000x power supply because while we did
know that this was overkill for this
project we wanted to make sure that the
fed would never spin even while gaming
ruining the silence of the build up
until this point basically everything
had gone according to the air quotes
plan but of course this is Linus tech
tips
there wasn't really a plan was there and
Jake presumably because he was busy
daydreaming about whatever it is the
youngins daydream about these days
eventually realized that the GPU and
radiator weren't going to work in their
original positions so out came the
dremel and off came the PCIe screw cover
then the GPU was put back into the lower
PCIe slot the 8x Lane won't affect the
performance as we demonstrated in this
video here and the radiator was replaced
our Samsung 850 Evo SSD was chosen for
its clean understated looks and great
price to performance ratio and we
mounted it using the included hardware
lining the reservoir and pump up with
the SSD on the drive mounting bracket
actually worked out nearly perfectly TM
one issue with this approach was that
the mounting didn't quite line up with
the CPU causing the tube going from the
CPU to the pump to not be quite you know
parallel and we could have easily fixed
this by drilling new holes and moving
the pump over a little bit but Jake had
a hot date in his imagination and didn't
feel like redoing it so hashtag deal
with it I guess
power cabling was taken care of by cable
mod who supplied us with custom lengths
of their sexy carbon custom cables that
perfectly fit the black-and-gray
aesthetic of our build and for tubing we
went with primo chills primo flex soft
tubing for its clarity and just general
awesomeness
we installed almost a hundred and fifty
dollars worth of EK fittings at this
point in an effort to make sure that our
runs were as straight as possible it's
not quite hard line precision but we
still think it looks pretty darn good
and it's quite a bit less work to
execute in the first place and to drain
for maintenance in the future if such a
thing should end up being necessary
bringing us to the scariest part of any
water cool build filling it up and leak
testing
so paper towels in hand we carefully
filled it watching for any leaks
but fortunately miraculously it was all
assembled correctly save for the fill
port which probably had something to do
with J cross threading it we threw in
some ek Vardar fans to handle airflow
while going perfectly with our
monochromatic color scheme at which
point yeah we were definitely ready to
disguise the ugly i/o cables that were
showing with some sleeving that was
actually meant for a 24 pin power
connector and some electrical tape
because who need correctly sized heat
shrink anyways not really what they did
ah then for the cherry on top we set up
a cable mod magnetic RGB W strip that we
use to make looking through the glass
super nice on your eyeballs speaking of
nice for your eyeballs we chose an LG
ultrawide monitor which actually came in
four inches wider than the desk itself
and then we also used a Corsair ten
Quiles keyboard since space is clearly
at a premium and to complement it G 403
Mouse that is as long as you don't mind
covering up your creation with a
mousepad and MX anywhere mark 2 would be
a great choice if you want something
that tracks directly on the glass
instead of needing that layer in between
yourself and your pcs beauty with all
this setup now we think and we're very
objective about these sort of things
that it looks pretty darn good
and it should be noted that with all the
hardware installed the overall rigidity
of the desk improved to the point where
it's lightweight construction was no
longer a concern but bottom line the
vector desk minis greatest strength also
ends up being its greatest weakness its
size this desk is going to fit basically
anywhere but at the same time it doesn't
offer quite enough room for low
sensitivity gaming even
with a ten keyless keyboard and a
typical desk pad ends up drooping
flaccid li over the sides and forget
about using a keyboard with a number-pad
with that said the finished product
looks and feels awesome
the price is super reasonable
considering what you'd pay for just a
normal computer case with a tempered
glass side panel and then just a normal
desk to put it on and if you're super
strapped for space this might just be
the coolest damn PC desk on the block
but if you want something that's a
little bit more functional well you
might want to wait a little bit because
this won't be the last desk PC we are
checking out ting is the mobile carrier
that provides more than just service for
your cellular phone they provide someone
to talk to if you are lonely and sad
that's right my friends when you call
customer service at ting you will speak
to a person not a robot with no
automated phone tree and they don't even
charge extra for that privilege you pave
only for what you use with the average
ting bill being only 23 bucks a month
per device if you're stuck in a contract
and you switch to ting they'll cover 25%
of your cancellation fee up to 75 bucks
and they have new lowered mobile data
rates data is now just $10 per gig
beyond the first gigabyte so head over
to Linus King comm to try out the
savings calculator and see if you'll
save and when you use our link you'll
also get 25 bucks and service credit or
towards a new device so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if is awesome get
subscribed hit that like button or check
out the link to where to buy the stuff
