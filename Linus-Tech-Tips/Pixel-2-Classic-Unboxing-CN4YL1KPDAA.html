time still no one won't try anyone
watching nope
oh this too okay poopy
okay I thought that when you select
unlisted for a live stream but it means
the video archive unlisted when you were
done but that apparently isn't how it
works and I think they changed the
defaults or something I'm not sure what
happened but oh man okay we've got a
live unboxing of the pixel - I know
we're a little late but mine just
arrived so I figured you know what the
hey we're not gonna do a full dedicated
video around it but why not a fun little
livestream Folly like like retro - Texas
style like actually Brendan's probably
happy to be using a phone to film it
rather than what we used to use to shoot
these live on box well they weren't live
before but they were kind of live in the
sense that I made a lot of mistakes and
generally a lot of them didn't get
edited out so let's check it out this is
my first hands-on with the pixel - and
it's the it's the Canadian pixel -
Canada imported by Google Canada
Corporation from other more different
Google Corporation that isn't in Canada
so that's why it's more expensive and
later yeah Canada had a Canadian flag -
we've all right so in terms of features
we're having really don't talk about
much no one wants to talk about phone
specs anymore the back is just a giant
hash tag and then we've got Google
assistant built-in as if it was possible
that that wasn't gonna be a thing and
Google limbs built in this is a little
unusual they're giving us the back of
the phone as our presentation I mean you
know some of us like to come up on our
phones from behind I could be among them
and then why don't you believe in do
phone unboxings anymore I'm actually
having some significant second thoughts
about this what am I supposed to say I
wonder when the last time somebody
looked at a get started guide for a
phone was okay and why do you need to
label the English section in other
languages if I can't read English do I
really
need to know that it says English
activate your pixel for iPhone users
turn off iMessage that is actually a
great tip I got screwed over on a fairly
significant deal once because I had
switched from an iPhone to an Android
phone and I've forgotten to turn off
iMessage and they have an iPhone and
they texted me okay put in your SIM
power it on and transfer some stuff
comes with an adapter and that's it go
to the website because you freaking noob
nothing comes on paper instructions any
clock be safe so this is probably like
don't let your phone on fire because we
don't want to we don't want the bad PR
around that oh I caught it yes it does
not count as a drop if I catch it before
it hits the ground didn't even hit the
table take that suckas
alright we got a quick charging power
adapter what is this 5 volt 3 amp Wow or
9 volt to them I actually didn't know
that Google was using an overpowered 5
volt quick charging method similar to
what oneplus has been doing for the last
couple of generations with their -
charge that's very interesting I mean
I'm sure other people knew this because
they have been following Google's pixel
phones a little bit more closely but I
actually didn't do our review of the
original pixel so I know less about it
then then you guys might possibly assume
oh this sucks I have the ultimate prop
for this stupid headphone headphone
adapter I have found you know what I'll
shoot handle my headphones out of my
pocket there on my desk upstairs but um
does anyone else appreciate the irony of
us filming this unboxing on a phone
literally surrounded by camera equipment
batteries for Red's other more different
batteries for Reds a couple of Handy
cams got a nice you know tripod head
here we could be using but we're not you
know
that's a nice high-quality these are
literally two grand a pump like each
piece of it lavalier microphone system
and look at me look at these lenses oh
look at this thing it's like t 2.0
whatever that means
I'm kidding Brandon I'm kidding just
chill out I know that it's F but like
more better right basically it's like F
but cinema are you still dying inside
I'm getting cancer all right so we got a
Type C cable you're interested in buying
this home right yes would you want the
the two are the two XL well I think with
- yeah just scientist a size don't need
the size your your hands are pretty
similar to a locust er yeah yeah all
right hi how can I help a BOSU come on
please who's a dick see that that is why
they had to delay sending this phone to
me so that someone at Google could be
like ok Google how do I say hi how can I
help in French and then I spat that out
and they figured out how to spell it and
put it on there that's what I was
waiting for that's why my pixel t11
simulate um so yeah that's pretty much a
lot slight kind of reminds me of the
original pixel in that sense like it's
not it's not super heavy like the galaxy
where is it crying I got my Galaxy s8
like the Galaxy s8 has like a density a
density to it that even though C you can
see the pixel 2 is a little bit taller
off the table it doesn't it feels more
like a the Nexus 5 was like that too or
don't quite light but they're kind of
nice in the hand like that I see with
the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 5s
doesn't like I like I personally like a
device with a little bit of like hat a
little bit of density to it but it also
doesn't feel cheap there's not a ton of
flex to it more than I you know what
Martin I'd actually like hold on a
second here
a little more than I'd actually like it
doesn't feel that premium even though
this is a kind of a like a it's a nice
not too slippery finish like it doesn't
feel like wow I just spent you know a
thousand Canadian rupees on this thing
so yeah bottom we got a type-c connector
asking you to drop it drop it I'm not
gonna drop it did you guys realize I
have like a few days to put this phone
through its paces and get a video up and
that's just to not be like way late so
I'm gonna be I'm gonna be completely
focused on this thing I don't even know
where my iPhone is right now I'm holding
that's right you're holding that makes
sense but I'm putting that down and I'm
just using the pixel to for the next a
little bit so button wise you know what
that's not bad I actually like this
button we had a couple issues with the
iPhone eight while we were trying to
shoot this accidentally locking the
phone between each other but this has
actually got a fair bit of like yes I
can hold it without without mashing it
kind of feel to it I like that um volume
button personally I do prefer a little
bit more I prefer it to be a little bit
more raised so I can really feel it in
my pocket right now it's easy to slide
your finger across it it's not too bad
though it's far from the worst I've felt
and it's got a reasonable click but it's
a little bit mushy I'm not a huge fan of
the volume button but I definitely
prefer it to this approach which is your
lock button here let's go this way which
is your lock button on the one side and
then literally no matter where you put
your other your finger across from your
thumb you're gonna mash volume down or
even worse Bixby and to be clear Bixby
does a lot of cool stuff but I mostly
don't want it doing that stuff when I'm
reaching for my lock button that's
that's the main issue glass this is
something that I've really been
observing lately is that not all Gorilla
Glass is the same glass feel is very
similar to the s8 but I was checking out
the me mix too and I have a video
coming on that as well and I noticed
that it had particularly slippery
gorilla glass and that it was really
hard to scratch much like the Droid
turbo and I mentioned this in in my
review of the Galaxy s8 active which is
on float plane right now and coming to
YouTube in a little bit but this one
this seems to be the normal stuff so
I'll be interested to see how easily it
gets micro scratches there's only two
foams now that I've encountered that
have had this sort of more slippery
feeling glass that seems to resist
scratching a little bit more as you guys
probably know fingerprint sensors on the
back in terms of the actual style of it
I definitely like it a lot more than the
first pixel like I can see how they
would want to continue with this sort of
you know dipped in dipped in glossiness
sort of look to the back of it but I
actually like that it's a lot smaller on
this one it makes it feel more like more
like an accent and less like an
overwhelming sort of we couldn't decide
what to make the back of the phone out
of so we put this on here hopefully you
know there's enough there's enough
exposure for the antennas that your
reception doesn't suck like it seemed
really like that was what they were
going for last time this seems a lot
better I mean that's pretty much it for
now I don't really know what else there
is to say I'm not gonna make you guys
like oh good it does allow you to I
thought they pulled an apple and they
were gonna make me put a sim in to set
up the phone but it looks like no that's
not the case
um but yeah I'm just gonna not gonna
make you guys sit through the setup with
me so I'm gonna go through that I'm
gonna start working on this review the
more I hold it though the more I'm
willing to compromise some of the sort
of rugged feeling this or dense feeling
nosov it for like a really nice holdable
form-factor actually quite quite like
that so far and I have really come
around to - on screen buttons now that
we have these these taller form factors
all the things I really liked about the
SI and I could be won over if this
camera is really good Brandon I'm
probably gonna lean on you for the
camera portion of this because I know
it's
really important really really important
selling point for Google in this guy so
that's pretty much it the box is open I
managed to make quite a mess tonight
look at this I've got pieces of box way
over here I got some here I got some
here here here all the way over to got
there there it is the phone finally
extracted I'm done no way by everybody
all right hold on did you end it
oh good cool uh if you guys haven't
already go check out the iPhone 8 review
that we posted today that would be
tremendously helpful big floods of
people going over to our videos and like
enjoying them is apparently good
according to YouTube we've been your
thing with the algorithm lately actually
this is kind of interesting this is some
sort of behind the curtain fun stuff
that you guys might enjoy if you're if
you're frequent viewers of the channel
or just pull up the studio up here so we
get what's called real-time views as
like a semi live feed so this updates
every hour this is the last 48 hours and
it's really interesting because when we
launch a video that seems to and it's
like it's weird sometimes it's hard to
tell what the YouTube gods care about
versus what the YouTube what displeases
the YouTube gods but when we launch a
video that is good for overall channel
momentum you'll see a spike okay so
you'll have like a count what I call a
steady state and they'll see a spike and
it'll come in to a steady state that's
above or like at where this before the
spike came okay when you launch a video
that hurts the channel momentum then
it'll go from see how its kind of
settles him cuz this is people just like
watching the back catalog after we
launched a video that did well they'll
get a spike from the video and then it
will actually dip down even worse than
if you hadn't launched a video at all
like looking at this we might have been
better off not even making the set
destruction vlog that we uploaded
yesterday even though by and large the
that's on it and the lake dislike ratio
and all those indicators that we look
for to find out whether the audience
liked it are positive so I don't really
get it so if you guys want to go check
out the iPhone video probably Nick is
watching this and posting it in the chat
otherwise you know oh maybe you know
what Brendan here when we go up to my
desk and oh oh yes there's a lot of
links going in right oh there are okay
well either way we should go up to my
desk cuz I'm gonna post this on like
Twitter or something later but this is
really funny I have finally found the
ultimate solution for mobile audio and
it's janky its janky but it's like it's
like the perfect Linus tech tip solution
see someone more you know something more
style oriented you know like oriented
might go okay my solution to no
headphone jack is to you know switch to
some sick new bose qc25 s or something
not me my solution is to stick with my
Sennheiser ie eight hundreds and just
create a universal pair of headphones
okay so check check this up terms though
okay so this this side is where my in
ears sound better than your headphones
that's how that works right here that's
how they stay on okay this is broken
actually but this is normally how I have
a microphone on them with my remote
control I don't need no you know touch
you know touch control although right
now I do because this broke
okay down here this is my this is my
cord and this is my universal adapter so
watch this Galaxy s8 yeah yeah you see
that okay okay this is my little tether
that came with the Moto X something
erotic
so this yeah look at that that is my
type C adapter Oh beautiful see that
look at that and then and then this yeah
hold on see how all this like is
conveniently right there exactly where I
need it this is my lightning adapter
elegant right okay you can have this
dream that that was all that was the
point I wanted to make</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
