unboxing of the p8 P 67 le from a Seuss
so cameraman has already jumped ahead of
me and he's looking at all the different
stuff down here so we have there this is
their turbo
whatever it's called turbo processing
unit or something like that anyway
between these two you can either boost
up performance or you can improve energy
efficiency let's just say that much here
we have support for SATA 6 gigabits per
second we have USB 3 and memo okay and I
actually used the memo K button on an
asus motherboard recently for the first
time it actually works I was not able to
post because the memory was not a
hundred percent compatible with the P 67
chipset I used the memo K button and set
it to a totally safe setting and I was
able to get into the BIOS to adjust all
the timings manually very neat
certificate of assurance low radiation
eco-friendly and anti surge well there
it is okay it supports the any CPU on
LGA 1155 so that is Core i5 core i7 CPUs
on LGA 1155 it is not backwards
compatible with LGA 1156 and you will
ruin it something if you try and do that
all right we have an EFI bios which is a
very cool thing as well as AI suite
which has all kinds of neat
functionality like adjusting fan
profiles that turbo thing the Eco thing
as well as monitoring your temperature
so let's get the board opened up and we
have accessories whoa an IDE cable I
haven't seen an IDE cable in a
motherboard box in a little while
actually so there's one here we have two
SATA 2 right angle cables we have one
say two three six gigabit per second
right angle cable please note there's no
physical difference between them other
than the white color coding which
doesn't matter here's an i/o shield here
is a user's guide and here is a support
DVD and powered by a su sticker download
the latest from the assist website don't
bother with that CD this is an le board
so that is why we are seeing a fairly
limited accessory package on this guy
however that could be bad news check
this out I found a jumper
okay so this jumper was probably
somewhere we are going to go on a voyage
of discovery and try to figure out where
this jumper came from my guess would be
the chassis intrusion oh no oh here we
go here we are clear this is a queen or
CMOS there is no chassis intrusion thing
so one to two is normal let's assume one
to two is those two there we go so
that's where that came from hopefully
and here's the board so let's start in
the middle where we have our LGA 1155
CPU socket which supports as I mentioned
before all core i5 and core i7 tips on
this platform that means because we're
using the p67 chipset you have full
support for overclocking k-series
unlocked chips as well as turning up the
turbo on turbo supporting processors but
because it's p67 it will not support the
onboard video on any of the core I
Series second-generation chips here we
have a wave style MOSFET heatsink it
looks like this board is using like a
four plus one phase power design as far
as I can tell yeah alright to say that's
what it looks like though so guys please
correct me if I'm wrong on that one
because it doesn't indicate anything on
the box itself and that makes life
difficult for Linus okay well let's keep
on moving along then here is our eight
pin CPU connector in its ideal location
here is our dual channel ddr3 supporting
slots so up to four slots up to I
believe it can support up to 32 gigs of
memory although please once again
correct me if I'm wrong here's the mem
okay button one IDE port check that out
yo so if you have an IDE drive you want
to use this is the board you want
because most P 67 boards do not support
IDE drives here's our 24 pin power
connector it's ideal location here are a
couple of SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
ports and here's another one so that
must be off the same controller as this
IDE as this IDE port okay here is our
chipset cooler so that's the i/o
controller chip under there that's going
to be running also the SATA 6 gigabits
per second quartz as
the sata3 gigabit per second ports here
we have four front USB headers a
firewire header we have apparently a
clear CMOS jumper as well as a com1
header okay in terms of expansion slots
at the p67 board so that means it is
crossfire ready we do have support for
one 16x card up here or dual 8x cards so
that means if you want to run crossfire
you will have enough bandwidth for two
cards without any issues here we have
two PCI slots three PCI slots this is a
relatively low end board so that's
something that I've come to expect
because you may want to carry forward
your sound card or some other PCI device
we've got two PCIe 1x slots and this is
a fairly ideal layout although maybe I'd
prefer one more PCIe 1x slot accessible
if you are running dual dual slot cards
because you're going to be left with two
PCI and one PCIe 1x if you're running a
crossfire configuration so let's have a
look at the i/o shield on the back of
the board here we have dedicated ps2
ports for keyboard and mouse 2 USB 3.0
ports optical audio out 6 USB 2.0 ports
we've got eSATA firewire Gigabit
Ethernet and 7.1 audio out so nothing
particularly exceptional about the back
of the board except look at this asus is
using screws spring mounted screws for
the chipset cooler so that's that's a
pretty nice touch I do like to see
screws used for mounting coolers versus
pushpins but it's not always possible
for economic reasons thank you for
