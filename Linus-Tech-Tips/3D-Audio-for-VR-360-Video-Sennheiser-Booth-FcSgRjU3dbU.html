powering our NAB coverage this year
check them out at the links in the video
description to kick off our coverage at
NAB 2016 we went to visit our friends at
the sennheiser booth to see some of
their new product launches first up we
have Sennheiser's new MKE 440 on camera
microphone this mic will be a welcome
step forward for anyone who has
previously used the MKE 400 on camera
microphone the slightly odd V shape of
the microphone is due to the dual
shotgun mics that Sennheiser has placed
in the MK 440 the result of this is a
mic designed to capture everything
within your camera's view while also
rejecting sound outside the cameras
frame giving a very focused all-around
recording the dual mics in the 440 are
shock mounted internally within the
microphones micro mesh enclosure making
the unit easier to maintain and use
there's also a dead cat cover for
extremely windy situations when needed
power wise the Mk II 440 makes use of
two triple A batteries making it fairly
easy to never have a problem powering it
here's a short test clip of how the mics
and ik on the noisy show floor so we're
here at sennheiser booth testing the MK
e 440 this is what it sounds like when
i'm directly in front of the camera
about three feet away this is what it
sounds like slightly off access to my
left and this is what it sounds like
slightly off access to my right what do
you guys think of how it sounds let me
know in the comments down below
next up Sennheiser was showing off their
two new additions to their partner
products with Apogee electronics they
have their new hand mic digital and MK
for digital made for use with USB audio
devices as well as iOS products the hand
mic digital is great for high ambient
noise situations
giving very strong clarity to vocals a
good solution for journalists that need
good audio on location with the MK 4
digital using Sennheiser's excellent MK
4 voiceover mic that will give live
streamers a great option for broadcast
quality sound using their new USB
connection available to the digital
version Sennheiser also had their demo
of the 3d AM Bo mic which is geared
towards 360 video and VR applications
this was my first time trying the
ambient I was greeted by a demo of a
girl playing cow in the middle of a
church and as I turned my head
throughout the space
I was surprised how act
you could feel the sound of the piano
change VR and 360 video rigs are popping
up quite frequently now and all of them
are in need of an audio solution like
the Ambu Center eyes are also mentioned
that they are working on ways of
mounting the Ambu directly into the
camera's mounting point in order to make
sure that the mic does not obstruct the
camera shots in anyway thanks again the
Sennheiser for sending us to nab this
year make sure to check out all of their
new stuff for nab in the link in the
video description also thanks to
Kingston for sending us here this year

micro SD card made for action cameras
