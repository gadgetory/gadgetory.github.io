detectives the coolermaster neptune 240m
features an exclusive pump design and
their new Silencio fans to provide
impressive near silent performance click
now to learn more the fortress fto 5 is
the more expensive smaller and more
refined little brother to the Raven our
vo5 a similar case by silverstone it
first shows us this refined style with
its front panel a very sleek and clean
looking metal finish accented only by a
reflective strip along the bottom which
has an illuminated Silverstone logo
behind it and the slot-loading optical
drive bay on the right hand side the
left side panel is a plain metal finish
with a relatively small window cutout
and that same reflective strip along the
bottom just without the Silverstone logo
this time my only gripe with this
particular panel is that I would have
liked to see the window shifted up a
little bit this would have pulled the
expansion cards and a little bit more of
the motherboard into view and done a
better job of hiding the cable clutter
at the bottom also the right side panel
is more or left the same as this left
side panel just without the window
cutout at the front of the top of the
case we have a set of solid and
satisfying power and reset buttons which
are on either side of a flip cover which
hides the audio headers dual USB 3.0
ports and two fan switches which have
high medium and low settings despite
only being labeled for high and low
behind the top i/o we have more top i/o
because of how the motherboard is
oriented once you slide the protective
grille back and lift it off of the case
you're able to access all of your
motherboard and expansion card i/o along
with the power in for your power supply
unit all the cables that you would need
to run to the top of your case because
of how the i/o is laid out are managed
to a sizeable porthole in the back of
the tower below this cable management
hole is the grille and removable fan
filter for your power supply and while I
do really appreciate removable fan
filters this one can be a little bit
frustrating to remove as it doesn't have
anything
to grab on to and it is set into the
case I would have appreciated if they
had the fan filter do a sliding
mechanism through the top of the case
instead which is actually what I thought
they intended when I first saw it but
it's not and for the last stop on our
tour of the outside of the FTO five is
the underside which is going to be
fantastic for anyone who intends to keep
their computer on a carpeted surface to
explain this the bottom of the tower is
completely flat and solid made of metal
and just has four little miniature
rubber feet allowing for extremely
limited airflow and largely removes
gross dust and particle pickup which
would be expected from a computer with a
bottom intake which is placed on a
carpeted surface but to allow for pretty
much any airflow at all there is a
fairly sizable gap built into the bottom
which allows the two large 180
millimeter air penetrator fans to
breathe quite deeply through their
removable fan filter which is also
tucked in neatly under the bottom of the
case Silverstone notes in there very
detailed manual that you can remove the
filter by simply pulling it to the side
but this doesn't seem entirely possible
due to a plastic lip which actually
helps keep the filter in place I would
alternatively suggest that you just
place your hands on both sides of the
case and pride down on the fan filter
with your fingers pulling it directly
off instead of attempting to slide it
off the doors on this case are quite
unconventional to open them you will
need to venture back up to the top of
the case reaching under the lip of the
side panel and you will find a hidden
switch in one fluid motion you can both
press the switch and pull up the side
panel freeing it from the case quite
elegant overall I would like to note but
please also note that you will need to
press the switch down when installing
the doors instead of just pressing on
them to get them back into position
please don't break that little switch
another thing I noticed when removing
the doors was the shape of the support
structure for said doors it lends itself
to the function of being a handle as
well now I didn't find this feature
noted anywhere in their manual but they
seemed very solid and easy to grab hold
of so I decided to over Tess tit
they passed with flying colors luckily
enough so you heard it here first the F
205 also happens to feature handles once
you enter the main compartment you'll be
able to see exactly how those Larr
180 million ear fans in the bottom will
be able to cool your various components
because of this awesome cooling setup we
decided to install an air cooler and not
bother with its fans as set included
fans will be able to take care of it
already which results in a quiet and
quite cool looking setup but if you want
to install a liquid cooler you would be
able to fit the radiator either in the
120 millimeter grill slot above the CPU
socket or you could remove the dual 180
millimeter fans in the bottom and
install up to a 2 by 140 millimeter
radiator or a 3 by 120 millimeter
radiator in that bottom placement on the
left hand side we have a squeeze mount
hard drive cage which is quite easy to
use and holds the hard drives quite
securely while allowing for a securing
screw if you're worried about them at
all above the cage is a vertically
installed power supply it's recommended
to install a power supply no longer than
160 millimeters here but if you did need
more space for a longer power supply you
could remove the hard drive cage below
allowing essentially any consumer power
supply to fit just fine
this Tower allows for up to three
hundred and fourteen point two
millimeter long graphics cards and 162
millimeter tall CPU coolers the CPU
cooler spec does seem a little bit
conservative though but that kind of
makes sense because Silverstone probably
doesn't want your cooler pressed up
against the window which is definitely
understandable that brings us to the
inside view of the Silverstone logo from
the front of the case which I would have
really liked to see in black plastic
instead of white as it is visible from
the outside through the window and
sticks out like a sore thumb the wires
also don't help with large unsleep
sections close to that white panel
behind the motherboard tray there are
two well-placed and easy to use SSD
mounting spots and the installation
housing for the slimline optical drive
that we noticed on the front of the case
the cable management options back here
are quite limited however with only a
couple zap straps hooks and no default
runs it can get a little messy and while
the motherboard tray is quite solid
which feels quite nice it's also kind of
annoying because there's a lot of
support structure behind the motherboard
which will definitely obstruct your
cable runs last but not least there's
the fact there is no rubber grommets to
hide the cable mess which is visible
through the left side of the case
and that side window in conclusion this
is an absolutely beautiful case if
you're looking for a refined sleek and
elegant look which uses solid metal
construction throughout it will perform
quite well it also performs quite well
in air-cooled environments thanks to
that built-in airflow allowance to the
beast 180 millimeter air penetrators in
the bottom of the case but it does
suffer from the cable management
Department a poorly sleeved power supply
and stock wires from the front i/o
paired with a complete lack of rubber
grommets can hamper the overall look
which is greatly disappointing when
compared to the extreme attention to
detail given to the rest of the tower
speaking of attention to detail our
friends over at Chi row have a fantastic
new product that they would like us to
show off today well technically it's a
series of new products that they have
titled their flavours lineup these are
an adaptation of their wildly popular
danboard ten thousand four hundred
million power portable battery bank that
we showcased in this video
not sure where they're going to put that
they have seven new flavors for any type
of taste chocolate vanilla banana vient
matcha which is Brandon's favorite
strawberry which is Linus's favorite I'm
sure you can see why it's freaking pink
and pumpkin hmm that's pretty cool that
they're releasing a pumpkin one so close
to Halloween eh yes it is and cheer
thinks so too
so they're offering a special deal on
their pumpkin flavor in the celebration
of Halloween from October 31st to
November 2nd the pumpkin flavor will be
available through Amazon for $29.99 on
the first 50 units that's ridiculous and
$39.99 for every unit after that which
is still fairly ridiculous you can check
out their whole flavors lineup in the
link in the video description and I want
you guys to let us know in the comments
do you have any kind of choice like
which one is your favorite color does it
even really matter to you I'm sure
they'd love to hear what you have to say
so let us know in the comments down
below also in the comments down below
let me know what you thought of the fto
5 if you don't like commenting below
videos and you don't like youtube
comments you can jump over to the forum
if you don't like the ads while you're
there you can become an awesome
subscriber person that's how awesome and
