motherboard for masseuse this is the m4
a 79 x TD Evo so this is part of their
extreme design philosophy of motherboard
building so let's have a quick look at
what all of that means extreme design
means that they're going for number one
performance number one reliability and
number one safety so Safety refers to
things like low EMI so that's
electromagnetic interference emissions
okay it's got instant performance up
with the turbo key so that's how they're
achieving their number one performance
goal and the number one reliability is
achieved using extreme durable solid
capacitors as well as stat cool three so
stat cool three puts a whole lot of
copper in the PCB which enables heat to
be dissipated more evenly not just by
the heat sinks attached but also by the
PCB of the motherboard itself now this
is a 790 X chipset board which means
we've got support for crossfire up two
quad cross crossfire X we have support
for fen and 2 X 3 and 10 M 2 X 4 also
with a BIOS update you have full support
for AMD's latest venom 2 X 6 processors
new features Express gate which is an
instant-on feature that enables you to
access games productivity and internet
no no no no that's something else
unrelated it allows you to access Skype
and internet browsers some basic stuff
without actually booting up into Windows
7 which it is completely ready for as
you can see from the sticker there ok
moving around to the back of the box
we've got a whole bagel list of stuff
that it does so ddr3 1800s overclocking
8 plus 2 face power we've got a whole
lot of other stuff here 8 channel audio
stylish heatsink they actually call that
out right on the box which I agree with
by the way
turbo key energy surge protection that's
kind of neat ok so moving around here
what do we got we got the new gen 8 plus
2 phase power and I wish I could get the
lighting just right here so you can read
that it's not so bad
there we go okay so six plus two phase
power breakthrough power designed to
fully unleash CPU potential okay then we
have EPU which is a system level energy
efficiency so that's natural chip on the
motherboard that takes care of making
sure that your system is staying as
efficient as possible and then turbo va0
time overclocking tuning tunings hey
we're closed okay so let's open up this
box and have a look at what we find
inside first thing I find is the acute
connectors so you can use that to
install all of your front panel case
connectors on and then you can plug the
whole brick right into your motherboard
very convenient then we have a user's
manual and okay so user guide which
contains a drivers and utilities DVD
don't use that download the latest off
these suits website I'm starting to
sound like a broken record saying that
maybe I'll stop no okay so in here this
is all English contains information
about azusa's software cue fan as well
as their other stuff how to create a
raid volume how to install all of your
hardware on the motherboard very nice
Thank You masseuse then we have an i/o
shield it's not color coded just as
plain silver one but it does have
they're they're mushy backplate cover
then we have four SATA 2 cables so these
are two right angle and two straight
cables which I will allow you to see by
holding them up here there we go
then we have one IDE cable alright
alright let's get some other board out
of the box and the first thing I notice
about it is definitely these stylish
heat sinks that is for sure now this is
a little bit different than the heat
sinks that I've seen on any of the suits
motherboards that I have previously
unboxed and it's not quite there
Fortress of Solitude style nor is it
there there they're new sort of more
more angular style that you see on the
Republic of gamers boards but this is
more like a wavy design
how long you can see that there you go
and so the the Northbridge is quite
similar it's actually like a two-tone
color scheme so you can see there's like
a black base and then kind of a wavy
blue part that comes out very unique
looking on like to see a black PCB that
always sort of makes a build look more
sharp very nice all right so let's start
with the basic features you got an am-3
socket with support for dual channel
ddr3 that's fairly standard that's what
you expect up at the top you've got a
four pin CPU power connector right where
it belongs top left over on the right
you've got a 24 pin power connector
again right where it belongs
then let's move around to you know what
I'm just gonna like stand here in front
of the camera it's a little bit easier
on my positioning ok so there's nothing
else really all that interesting up on
the top this does not feature the memo
okay button but I mean really ddr3
compatibility is so good these days with
all the platforms that I've played with
you don't have to worry too much about
it we've got one IDE port here as well
as wow multitude of SATA ports so ok
these four are gonna be running off of
the chipset and then these three are
gonna be running off of somewhere else
unless there are six running off of the
chipset you know what I'm not gonna
guess we're gonna have one two three
four five six seven SATA to ports down
here in the bottom left you can see that
these two are on a right angle so this
is sort of the ideal configuration in my
mind but I can see why Isis didn't worry
about making all of these ones right
angle because your PCI Express slots are
positioned quite high up on the board so
even if you have a dual slot card
installed here it's not going to
interfere with these SATA ports so it's
not that big of a deal next here we've
got our USB 2.0 front panel connectors
and then we have a firewire front panel
connector now this is an odd one I don't
remember a time that I've seen a front
header so start reset hard drive LED
power LED I don't remember a time that
I've seen it here on annecy sport very
odd normally a SUSE puts it right here
and it's sort of always there here we've
got the chassis intrusion detects
as well as an over-voltage um per then
we have our front panel audio in its
ideal location then okay PCI Express
expansion slots we have two PCIe 16
supporting crossfire X if you install
two dual slot cards you're gonna end up
with one PCIe 1x and one PCI slot that
is definitely the ideal configuration
for those slots moving up here we have a
common header okay
pretty nice then we move around to the
back of the board where we find the i/o
for the back panel to ps2 ports I
personally still like to see these on a
board they don't take up that much space
although some people complain about it
then we have one two three four five six
seven eight USB 2.0 ports no support for
USB 3.0 but this is a fairly budget
oriented board it's like a budget gaming
platform so it looks good performs good
but you're missing some of the frills
and gimmicks then we have optical audio
out eSATA which is really nice to see
firewire Gigabit Ethernet as well as 7.1
audio thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the m4 a7 9 x
TV Evo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
