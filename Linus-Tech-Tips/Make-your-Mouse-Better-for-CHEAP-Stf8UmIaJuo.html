much attention about their gaming mouse
for a lot of people the accuracy weight
and shape of the mouse is incredibly
important
so then Logitech G Pro Wireless is only
80 grams has 60 hours of battery life
and a top notch sensor which is great if
you want to spend a hundred and fifty US
dollars on a mouse 150 US dollars for a
mouse so today we're gonna show you how
you can get a mouse with nearly the same
swagger
what's more than quadruple the battery
life the nearly just a third of the
price do you love your pet but have a
hard time finding local daycare for them
well with Rover you can find pet sitters
Walker's or even long-term boarding in
your neighborhood get 10% off your first
booking at the link below
this year is logic XG 305 light speed I
know it doesn't look special and to be
honest aside from the light speed
Wireless and hero 12,000 dpi sensor it
really isn't there are clear places
where corners have been cut and costs
have been saved like there's no RGB
there's only three extra buttons and it
weighs nearly a hundred grams which in a
field with players like the final Mouse
airs 58 at 62 grams is actually pretty
fricking chunky but bear with me for a
minute here because on the bright side
the overall shape is a straight copy
from Logitech's much-beloved g pro wired
not the G Pro Wireless because they're
completely different and it's cheap
relatively coming in at just under $50
but it's not a new Mouse in fact it's
been on the market for almost a year so
why are we talking about it now well
that year has given the enthusiast Mouse
community plenty of time to dream up
little hacks and major mods to make it
into a mouse that can really swing with
the Heavy's or in this case the lights
the the light hitters before trying
these mods we need to establish a
baseline between the stock G 305 and the
G Pro we think it could beat okay so
this is the first Mouse I want you to
let me know about the feel and the
weight okay I usually use AG 502 so I am
yeah I'm a chunky boy I mean how can I
not love the G Pro wireless it's light
and Wireless and it still has like the
fantastic sensor it's so balanced it's
great it's like like no part of it feels
too heavy it feels like it's just like
so easy to move so easily carry and it's
like it's pretty natural to move it like
I don't know everything about the G Pro
is just good I think this is what a
wireless mouse would be like that's the
baseline that's a standard
is this mouse heavier well this feels
heavier
I think the G 305 is a bit heavy for my
liking
it seems shorter I don't know if that's
true but it seems like a less longer
yeah the weight distribution feels fine
it feels like it's definitely back heavy
it almost feels like there's too much
weight kind of back here there's it's
not on the back end it's more Center so
it's where my fingers are I think I like
the shape of the other one a little bit
better yeah it feels heavier in the back
as well in the same kind of way if the G
Pro Wireless is a 10 as a wireless mouse
the G 305 I would have to put 7 yeah
it's just like way too heavy so weight
reduction is a priority there is
actually a ton of support for the G 305
on sites like Thingiverse with full
honeycomb shells ready to download and
3d print which can get this mouse down
to obscene figures like 65 grams for
this user set sadly that's not something
many of you will be able to do at home
if you don't have a 3d printer but don't
worry there's still a bunch of room for
improvement that is more accessible
namely towards the back of the most
where there is a 23 gram weight in the
form of an alkaline double-a battery
there are several different choices with
some benefits to each approach so we
bought them all and weighed them for
your viewing pleasure and if the
pleasure of maintaining the 250 hour
rated battery life is important to you
then the natural choice is likely
Energizer's lithium doublea's which
bring the overall weight down 8 grams
from 96 to 88 that's a sizable jump but
the lack of recharging is a bit of a
bummer so if that matters to you we'd
recommend some rechargeable lithium
double aids like this pair from 10 volts
that we picked up for a admittedly rough
$26 on Amazon they have an advertised
1000 discharge cycles and they only have
a 2 gram weight premium over their
non-rechargeable counterparts but for me
the stupid long 250 hour battery life is
honestly a bit unnecessary I'm
personally a fan of using a standard
rechargeable nickel metal hydride
triple-a battery with an adapter this
give us about 100 hours of rechargeable
life at about 86 grams not too shabby
along with being better for the
environment than a disposable and a hell
of a lot more convenient
however the lightest option is actually
a triple-a lithium cell at just seven
and a half grams for the battery and an
additional two grams for an adapter we
bought on Amazon that we cut up to save
weight although you can also just use a
small tinfoil ball and some tape to make
it even lighter this setup brings our
total weight down to just 82 grams only
2 grams heavier than the g pro Wireless
add nearly a third of the price let's
see what our testers think now Wow looks
like the other one hmm interesting yeah
it feels really light that's awesome
this one does not feel as back heavy
bottom heavy y'all the weight that was
in the back is just gone it's only get
like shifted it's just gone there's less
weight back here and it makes it easier
to move around when you're gripping it
kind of like in the center it doesn't
have as much junk in the trunk you might
say do you see that kill this feels like
a much more like balanced Mouse it feels
great it's like light definitely feels
more balanced than the one I tried
earlier more ammo yeah 305 with a
lighter battery is basically just the
best most in the world the modified G
305 is not a 10 yet I think it's eight
eight and a half this is a hundred what
how much is it 50 why is this worth
ninety more dollars yeah this is pretty
amazing and if I'm saving $100 u.s. I
would probably pick this up okay not bad
but overall it seems like there is still
something have you said for the
engineering put into logitech's
flagship G Pro Wireless with its near
perfect weight distribution excellent
feature set modularity and no fuss
functionality hell we actually love both
mice and if the G 305 isn't quite the
right shape for you and or you have the
money to shell out the G Pro Wireless
should definitely be in the running for
your next Mouse what show should the G
305 that's the end of the video go out
and get this thing it's gonna be good
it's gonna be
and thus you just have mitts and maybe
get to working for me though the math
drop vast curve gaming monitor is 35
inches of gaming goodness from corner to
corner
it features an ultra wide 34 40 by 1440
resolution it's got 2 millisecond
response times it's free sync enabled
and it's got a 100 Hertz refresh rate
it's 2,500 to 1 contrast ratio means
that blacks look nice and deep and it's
basically a seamless visual experience
whether you're gaming working watching a
movie or just browsing the web check it
out at drop comm at the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
guys if this video sucked which it
didn't you know what to do but it was
awesome so like the video get subscribe
and check out the links to where you can
buy this stuff in the video description

merch store we can get cool shirts like
this one and a link to our community
forum which you should totally join is
