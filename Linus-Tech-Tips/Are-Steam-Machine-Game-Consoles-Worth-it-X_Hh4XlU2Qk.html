what this video is not is a
comprehensive review of steamos what
this video is is my impressions from
having used the Alienware steam machine
which was provided free of charge by
Dell as a gaming console for the last
little while so expect a mishmash of my
thoughts on both the hardware and the
software and what they add up to in
terms of the user experience
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster check out
the link in the video description to try
it for free let's start with the
hardware there are going to be no
surprises here if you've been following
steamos through its long and arduous
birthing process over the last two years
because this is pretty much the same
piece of kit that Alienware first
unveiled as a living room console
running steamos almost two years ago
then when it became apparent that valves
steam OS and steam controller teams were
operating on oh I don't know say
valvetime released a few months later as
the Alienware alpha running Windows with
a living room friendly game launching UI
and an Xbox 360 controller presumably to
recoup some of the hardware engineering
costs that went into it
so yeah it's got somewhat dated but
actually not totally incapable hardware
for casual games and even older triple-a
titles like BioShock Infinite at low to
medium settings my model is equipped
with a has well based core i3 dual core
eight gigs of RAM a one terabyte hard
drive and an 860 m 2 gig
ish equivalent custom Maxwell based GPU
Alienware is touting the steam machine
as upgradable like a PC as well but I'd
say that's a little misleading
you can add RAM and a larger drive or
SSD but the motherboard and video card
are both non-standard so if you bought a
maxed out config today there would be no
upgrade path with the graphics card
being the biggest concern here since
it's the same all the way from the 4:49
price point to the 749 price point not
the way that step-up options usually are
handled on a gaming machine but a
necessary limitation with this kind of
highly customized form factor on that
note I'd say industrial design wise
Alienware did a really great job it's
not as small as an Nvidia shield Android
TV or anything like that but the overall
look is very subtle and if it wasn't for
the glossy plastic I'd be giving full
marks here the black housing features a
couple USB 3.0 ports and alien
head-shaped power button and steam logo
on the front the color of these back
lights by the way can be changed or
disabled altogether around the back
you'll find the power input
hdmi 1.4 output HDMI input note though
that this is a pass-through only not a
capture card an optical audio output
note also that there is no analog audio
output a bit of a head-scratcher and you
land port and two more USB ports this
time of the 2.0 speed variety a fifth
USB port is on the inside for the
wireless receiver that supports up to
four steam controllers the unit is
quieter than a spinning optical drive at
idle and under load when oh I don't know
you might be playing a game say for
example with sound it was significantly
louder than that but inaudible over the
background music and ambient sounds of
any but the quietest games like limbo
speaking of games in addition to the
console you'll get a couple of games in
the box as well as a steam controller
although I'm going to leave the
long-term use functionality focused
review of this puppy to Luke who is
working on that right now in the
meantime let's get into my experience
using steam OS when you run the initial
setup you are prompted to connect to a
network prompted to run some updates if
applicable and then to create or log
into an existing steam account
text-entry with the touch pads is
actually pretty clever but my account
name has an underscore in it so I
actually had to go get a keyboard to
plug in to log in because the on-screen
keyboard has two till DS for some reason
and no underscore strike one then at the
home screen my controller started
tweaking out with the vibration motor
going crazy and overriding my keyboard
and mouse inputs so I actually had to
hard reset the system and then finally
upon reboot I was prompted to update the
controller firmware which fixed the
issue so far not a great experience
strike two next I headed to my library
to download some Linux compatible games
where I was surprised by a couple of
things number one while the gain count
that valve keeps throwing around is
utterly meaningless I mean there were
over 10,000 total PlayStation 2 games
but come on how many of them were worth
playing there are some pretty decent
indie games like Super Meat Boy and
papers please and while mostly somewhat
dated
way more Triple A grade gains than I
expected like BioShock Infinite
Borderlands 2 and Borderlands the
pre-sequel Witcher 2 civilization 5 and
Metro last light that run on Linux the
valve titles that are supported we can
kind of take for granted here but those
are good too but the thing that really
stands out is that third-party developer
support for Linux has improved in the
last two years to the point where if you
bought a steam machine just for playing
native games it would be pretty hard to
get bored and speaking of things that
are hard browsing and buying games
I searched valiantly in the store for a
steam OS compatible tag until finally
near the bottom I was like hallelujah
steam machine tag only to realize that
that tag is to buy a steam machine come
on valve here's a request for this
feature from five years ago instead of
being able to just see all the Linux
games in one place I have to check every
product page individually and look for
the small little OS support icon and
then buy it and the worst part is that
nothing in the checkout process prevents
a newcomer who doesn't know about this
from buying incompatible games I mean I
I know that steam allows refunds now but
preventing issues like this is a lot
better than fixing them after the fact
strike three once I got gaming though
things got a little smoother again for
native games launching them as fast and
the performance is fine as long as you
don't overestimate the capabilities of
your hardware and you account for the
constantly shrinking but still
significant Linux performance penalty
and there's more good news for the games
that are not Linux compatible if you
have a capable Windows gaming box
elsewhere in the house logged into the
same steam account and your home network
performs very well the steam OS
interface allows those games to not only
be run remotely using steam in-home
streaming but also even installed
remotely and usually as long as you
don't have a UAC pop up to deal with or
something like that without ever
actually getting off your butt and
putting down your steam controller and
going and looking at that computer but
Linus hold on a minute if I wanted to
stream games over my local network steam
link can do that for 50 bucks
why am i spending 500 plus dollars on a
full PC for this exactly great question
and I wish the answer was something like
well it's got all these other great
capabilities but it doesn't and to
address the Linux army that is
undoubtedly charging to the comments to
inform you that there's a checkbox to
enable the Desktop Linux experience so
you can sue do it up I know but I don't
care that's completely irrelevant to the
target audience for this product the
audience that isn't already just running
a normal Steam client on Linux for even
better customizability the audience for
whom overscan settings are apparently
called resolution the console audience I
mean for people who just want to veg on
the couch in front of their gaming box
honestly I think even issues like the
default and gamepad mapping for Tomb
Raider being an unusable disaster that
required me to go source one of the
thankfully surprisingly usable community
created ones are going to be a
showstopper and these people really
don't want to hear that they're going to
need an external capture PC to stream to
twitch and that this alleged game
console doesn't support all but
ubiquitous features like being able to
Netflix and chill or locate arguably
actually watching movies is not a
prerequisite for that so I guess you're
good there but but win it but what it
can't do without an add-on app purchase
or the requisite Linux ninja training is
just plain Netflix or Hulu or stream
most content in general and while
YouTube thankfully works the built-in
browser makes it a frankly fairly
rubbish experience if I did want to
watch a youtube video I would expect
pressing the steam button on the
controller would indicate that I would
like to mute that video and switch to
another task now but no it just keeps
playing in the background and that's
just one of the many annoying things
about the experience hopefully more
tightly integrated native apps arrive in
the future to make the experience more
complete but I have a hard time seeing
where developer support is going to come
from
less valve can figure out how to sell
some consoles which at this point I
think is just plain not going to happen
because right now a steam machine is a
Super Nintendo without Super Mario World
it's an Xbox without halo it's the Wii
without a gimmicky game in the box that
lets you flail a weird dildo and watch
graphical representations of you and
your roommates boning each other at
bowling so while valve is a smart
company and I'm sure someone over there
has after very careful consideration
decided that exclusive content doesn't
align with the core purpose of this
entire freaking project a desire to
unshackle gamers from their dependency
on closed systems from the likes of
Microsoft or Sony and Drive Linux as a
more open gaming platform that doesn't
change the cold hard truth that this is
a different market and your noble
philosophy is not going to sell consoles
great exclusive titles sell consoles and
steamos has nothing that doesn't run on
the regular Steam client it manages to
deliver none of the core benefits of the
PC the versatility to run anything
through a web browser and any app you
could possibly want wide compatibility
nearly limitless gaming experiences we
are surround endless peripheral choices
etc and manages to deliver none of the
benefits of a console plug-and-play
ease-of-use exclusive titles familiarity
to casual users and I guess I just can't
see who it would appeal to other than
tech heads with enough disposable income
to toss out a random extra box that
doesn't really do much under there TV
and even for them wouldn't they just
have an extra hundred dollars then for a
Windows license it looks like to me that
steam OS is biggest competitor aside
from steam link which I mentioned before
is steam itself running in big picture
mode a much more sensible option for
ballers who want to D tether that living
room gaming experience from their
desktop one incase little Sally wants to
make a PowerPoint presentation or
whatever while they're gaming on the TV
something that steam link cannot do
because it has to display exactly what
is on the screen of
the computer so if I had to place my bet
today and it's not the first time I've
said this
I'm with Razer and NVIDIA on the Android
gaming bandwagon that is a platform with
a massive install base and developers
who have a track record of releasing
software on it and expecting to make a
good return on their effort as much as I
hope I'm wrong and as much as this isn't
Alienware fault or any of the hardware
partners I'm pronouncing the steamos
platform dead on arrival unless there's
a seemingly impossible philosophical
change at valve but you know what
doesn't require a dramatic philosophical
change to appreciate FS P's Hydra G's
750 power supply features 80 plus gold
efficiency with a zero decimal zero
noise mode depending on the load on the
power supply for that one hundred and
thirty five-millimeter fluid dynamic
bearing fan it is fully modular and it
has ecaps that are made in Japan with a
focus on reliability they're using what
they call a server grade design with
copper bars joining the main board and
the daughter board to increase
conversion efficiency and it comes with
three hydrogen occurs to match a variety
of build color themes something I wish
more manufacturers actually did because
it can be like everything's matching
except there's like your power supply
sticker and I mean the case industry has
gone as far as to make cases that cover
the power supply so that you don't have
to worry about that but still there are
very very few that feature that so it's
nice to see those stickers anyway if you
want to learn more about that power
supply check out the link in the video
description so that's pretty much it
guys thanks for watching if you just
like this video hit dislike if you
disagree with me about steamos hit just
like two if you liked the video go
please do hit the like button it does
make my self-esteem go up and I think
there's other things you can do too
right
