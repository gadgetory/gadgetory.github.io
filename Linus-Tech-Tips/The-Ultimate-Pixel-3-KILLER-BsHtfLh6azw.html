device it's got a flagship tier
Snapdragon 845 SOC a six point one eight
inch IPS display six gigs of ram a
hundred and twenty eight gigs of storage
and a four thousand milliamp hour
battery and it costs just three hundred
US dollars off contract so then why
weren't we all excited about the poco
phone f1 when everyone else was a month
ago the specs of this thing are amazing
well it's because the included me UI
operating system is IMO terribad so
we're gonna walk you guys through how
you can turn this $300 flagship killer
into almost a pixel three XL equivalent
for free
burne will take say 500 has a modern
Middle East design with its brushed
aluminum panels and dual hinged swing
tempered glass panels check it out today
at the link below now even if you do
like me UI there's a fair bit of
evidence that Xiaomi is intentionally
nerfing the camera on the f1 through
software to keep their budget poco phone
brand from competing with their
higher-end devices so Android software
flashing then honestly I haven't given
much thought to custom roms since
Samsung ditched TouchWiz and CyanogenMod
died a couple of years ago but lineage
OS which was founded shortly after
signings demise by a few of its core
developers has been going strong ever
since lineage OS shares many of
CyanogenMod strengths like its lack of
bloatware solid customization and
regular security updates but oddly
enough one difference is that it doesn't
have the stock google apps by default
thanks to some legal encouragement from
google so that stuff will need to be
flashed on afterwards more on that later
the point is once you put it all
together you end up with what is
effectively the stock Android experience
like you would get on a pixel device and
with a little bit of tinkering we can
even make it look like the new pixel
threes so that's what we're gonna do now
it's almost time to begin but before I
do I want to put a big disclaimer this
process is going to involve wiping it
you will lose your data all right so
it's not another way let's get started
you'll need a computer and a USB cable
as well as a full charge on your phone's
battery to ensure that it doesn't die
during the following procedure
starting in the Settings app we're gonna
navigate to about phone then click the
me UI version or build number until it
says you are now a developer open it
were that easy what this actually does
is unlock the developer options that
we're gonna need for this process
including USB debugging and OEM and
locking on Shelby phones like the poco
phone unlocking the bootloader requires
you to register your device to a Xiaomi
account with a linked phone number after
which there's a 72 hour waiting period
before you can unlock the bootloader
once your device has read
- you're me account with the phone
number download the me unlock app to
your PC from the description
we'll have that down below and run
through the steps in the app your phone
should now have an unlocked bootloader
which allows you to flash a custom
recovery firmware next up we'll be
installing our custom recovery firmware
this will allow us to flash our
third-party OS on to the device so we
will need platform tools linked in the
description so download and extract that
then move the entire contents to a
folder named ADB in the root of your
computer's C Drive with those files in
place plug the device into your PC and
then hold the volume down and power
buttons until you are in fastboot mode
at this point it's probably a good idea
to start downloading the larger files
that you'll need including the 9.0
firmware and vendor files the latest
lineage OS build and T WRP all of these
are also linked in the video description
back on the PC open CMD and now we can
get to flashing our custom recovery
firmware first up we're gonna check if
fastboot can detect our connected device
once that's good to go we can move our T
WRP recovery file into the adb directory
flash it and then boot to it back on the
phone you should be booted into T WRP
mode so there should be a prompt for a
password here but just click cancel and
then wipe just the data partition go
ahead and reboot to recovery and then we
can copy over both the disable force
encryption and magic files we're going
to install the encryption disabler first
followed by magic with a reboot in
between
now our poco f1 is rooted and ready for
a custom ROM at this point you can
choose between lineage OS pixel
experience or whatever else you're into
but we ran into some weird bugs with
pixel experience so we're not ready to
recommend it at this time since lineage
OS doesn't come with Google Apps you'll
need a couple of extra steps here so
we're gonna need to download them
separately at the link in the video
description please note that you must
use the arm 64 Android 9.0 nano very
this has a very small number of apps but
the larger packages can cause issues so
just grab anything else that you're
missing from the Play Store later stick
with nano please
so copy over the rom files including the
vendor firmware the lineage OS build and
the google apps that we downloaded just
then and start by installing the vendor
firmware followed by the lineage OS file
and the Google Apps
lastly clear the cache and then reboot
the phone back to Android and
congratulations you now have a fully
functional lineage os equipped flagship
killer but you'll probably need to
reinstall the Magister dot via T WRP
like we did before and then after doing
that honestly I was pretty impressed the
experience is damn close to a pixel
phone but we can still go further
the ruthless pixel launcher from the XDA
labs app store is almost a perfect copy
of the pixel free launcher and with a
little tweaking can be made basically
indistinguishable from the real thing as
for the fancy pixel 3 live wallpapers
well those can be had simply by
downloading Google wallpapers from the
Play Store as well as a third-party
wallpaper pack app that we have linked
in the video description and bam from
the front this thing might as well be
the same damn phone saved for the
difference between the IPS screen of the
polka phone and the OLED on the pixel as
for from the back well the polka phones
Kevlar finish actually feels pretty good
and non slippery in the hand but it
doesn't look amazing to my eye but then
the pixel 3 doesn't look great from this
side anyway so it's not like you're
really missing much we both got the
fingerprint scanner back there as for
the camera by default the poco f1 has a
pretty crap camera to be frank but with
the ported Google camera app from the
pixel phone which you can install via
the link in the video description it's
it's really simple it can actually hang
with the big guns colors tend to be a
little oversaturated with slightly lower
sharpness compared to the pixel 3xl but
surprisingly in portrait
it actually has better edge detection
likely thanks to the second rear camera
so in a nutshell there are some caveats
here there's the time investment into
flashing your device the IR face unlock
camera doesn't yet work on lineage OS
and there's the possibility of voiding
your warranty but this thing is really
great for $300 like really great to put
that price in perspective everyone was
losing their shape when oneplus launched
the oneplus one for $300 and that was
four years ago since then inflation has
gone up and phone prices in general have
absolutely skyrocketed so in today's
terms you could literally buy a pack of
these for your whole family
for the price of a single iPhone 10's
pixel 3xl or note 9 think about that
the master off XA k g:k 7 X X red
edition open-back headphones are on sale
for 20% off for cyber monday they
feature the same legendary sound and
build quality as their predecessor and
that was a huge hit with the audiophile
community with highs that were boosted
by an innovative flatware voice coil
mids that were brought up to better
balance the range and lows that were
raised by three decibels for an
immersive sound these are a
collaborative design with mass drop and
AKG and they include the custom ruby red
color way to help the aesthetic really
pop from the competition they're now 159
down from $1.99 so join the drop today
