gtx970 showdown both of these solutions
cost over $1,000 for the video cards
alone and bring a monstrous amount of
gaming horsepower to the table but only
one can be victorious today stay tuned
for the stunning conclusion and also
don't miss our journey back to the
parking lot where it all started for an
outdoor unboxing of the fantex
and thew evolve old-school ltte style
from December 13th to 20th 2014 you can
save on select Intel CPU Schnucks and
SSDs with special holiday rebates from
select retailers click now to learn more
now I often get miss quoted as saying
that you shouldn't buy two graphics
cards if there's a more powerful single
GPU option available but and we've
talked a fair bit about SLI scaling
recently including in this video right
here
there is one exception to this rule that
almost always holds true the second tier
the one just under the flagship graphics
card is usually based on the same
processing core is cut down in a way
that doesn't affect performance too
dramatically it overclocks like that and
is much less expensive so if you can
stretch your budget to of those
sometimes doesn't cost much more than
one flagship card because they don't
carry that best of the best price
premium but Linus what if one top of the
line or even two second fiddle graphics
cards just isn't enough GPU for me
well my first response to that would be
why the heck not that's an awful lot of
video card power and my second response
would be I'm just kidding I know you can
never have enough video guard power
especially if you want a game at 4k or
at very high frame rates that's just
messing with you guys so let's take a
look at the contenders today and then he
has top-of-the-line uber card du jour is
the GTX 980 it features a base clock of
11:26 megahertz a boost clock of 12 16
megahertz 4 gigs of GPU memory clock
seven gigahertz and 2048 CUDA cores
sounds awesome right well it should
because it costs over five hundred and
fifty dollars each to pick up one of
these puppies and just over $1,100 for
the two of them that you'll need to take
advantage of that rog swift 1440p 144
Hertz monitor or that brand-new 4k 60
Hertz gaming monitor if you want to play
the latest triple-a titles but maybe
there's another way the GTX 970 by
comparison is clocked at 10 50 megahertz
on the core has a boost clock of 1178
megahertz also features four gigs of GPU
memory clocked at 7 gigahertz and has
16,000 64 cuda cores less than the GTX
980 but it's not exactly a slouch either
and it weighs in at only 340 dollars
meaning that three of these would
actually cost less then 2 GTX 980 s so
let's start with the raw FPS data here
shall we
across-the-board average frame rates
were really close between our two test
configurations on our core i7 5960 x
extreme edition test platform tomb
raider continues to be the poster child
for multi-gpu gaming with about a 20%
performance advantage at a 10 percent
lower cost for the 3-way setup booyah
Far Cry 3 and Crysis 3 tell a different
story however both shows solid results
for the triple config if we just look at
the charts but while sitting in front of
them at 1440p was fine so you high
refresh rate gamers would be happy with
this config at 4k the stuttering and
hitching was unbearable with three
graphics cards and dual 90s delivered a
much smoother gaming experience the rest
of our games dirt showdown Middle Earth
shadow of Mordor and BioShock Infinite
didn't have noticeable hitching or
stuttering but also didn't demonstrate
the same performance advantage as Tomb
Raider for our three-way configuration
something I would have had to see if I
was going to recommend 3-way SLI for
folks who play more than just the games
that happen to run really really well on
it especially when you consider that
triple graphics card configuration has
other disadvantages as well in gain
power consumption is actually closer
than I expected probably because the
utilization of the third GPU is never
going to be as much as the second which
is never as much as the first so this
was basically a draw but both the
temperatures at which our cards were
running and the experience of sitting
there next to them were a little bit
uncomfortable for me
our 970 rig was much louder and
especially the middle sandwiched GPU ran
much hotter than either of our better
space 9 ATS and that's with a fan
blowing directly over top of them not to
mention that two cards will take up
fewer of the available expansion slots
on your motherboard that you might like
to use for PCI Express SSDs sound cards
or other fancy new functionality for
your system as it becomes available so
its conclusion time for gaming I just
don't think the added bang for the buck
of the three-way config of second-tier
cards compensates whoops for the
disadvantages associated with this kind
of a setup you could possibly make an
argument for it if you were planning to
use your system for things other than
gaming like 3d rendering or
cryptocurrency mining or something like
that but frankly even then the higher
clock speed an additional cuda cores of
the 1980s means that unless the nine 70s
are scaling nearly perfectly the
performance is going to be similar
anyhow and by the time you're spending a
thousand dollars on GPUs what's another
hundred bucks to get a much more elegant
solution so that's all there is really
to it this was a fun experiment but the
conclusion didn't shake the foundations
of the pre-existing knowledge we had on
the topic it just gave us a clearer
understanding of what folks who want to
run at 2560 by 1440 144 Hertz or 4k 60
Hertz need to power their setups
speaking of clearer understanding we
have a new sponsor online as tech tips
that helps you better understand the
guts of all your electronic devices
iFixit you may know I fix it from there
tear downs of a multitude of gadgets
like their phones like the iMac retina
5k their guide for which I actually
followed to create my upcome
iMac 5k internals upgrade video but what
you may not know about them is that they
also have a full lineup of professional
electronics tools the cornerstone of
their tool lineup is the pro Tech tool
kit which includes seven tools to assist
you with any mod or malfunction on one
of your little electronic gizmos the Pro
Tech tool kit includes a 54 bit driver
kit which features standard specialty
and security bits
it's got ESD safe precision tweezers an
anti-static wrist strap or you can wear
it on your ankle like I do prying a
bunch of prime tools in both nylon and
metal sputters I never leave home
without my Pro Tech tool kit as I can
always find a use for it when I'm
working with electronics and you can
purchase the kid over at ifixit.com
slash Linus where it's available for
only sixty four ninety-five which by the
way includes a lifetime warranty I
actually didn't know that but wait if
you use our offer code Linus you can
actually save ten bucks on the Pro Tech
tool kit or any other purchase over
fifty bucks so if I fix it you can fix
it yourself and if you guys don't
believe this obviously written by Nick
so like very strong endorsement if I fix
it it's actually all true in this case I
bought my my pro Tech tool kit myself I
paid my own real money for it over a
year ago and it's just a fluke that they
advertise with us now I absolutely love
my kit and they're great guys over there
so I think that's pretty much it guys
like the video if you liked it dislike
it if you just like to leave a comment
if your feelings more complicated than
this also check out the link in the
video description to support us you can
buy a cool t-shirt like this one give us
a monthly contribution or change our
amazon bookmark to earn with our
affiliate coats we got a small kickback
whenever you buy new graphics cards or
whatever else the case may be thanks
