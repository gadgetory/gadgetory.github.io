the most ridiculous thing that I think I
have ever seen on this channel and I
mean ridiculous in a good way in this
case so this is the Kolar so the first
time we've ever unboxed a product from
Koehler because they make plumbing stuff
Kohler Moxie single function showerhead
with sound capsule polished chrome
fennekin
you're going to see this on the shelf at
like a home depot it's like really
really ah so what do they have to say
for themselves about this guy 60 angled
nozzles provide full enveloping spray
coverage have the finishes engineered to
resist corrosion in daily wear
showerhead is covered by lifetime
limited warranty and the sound capsule
carries a one-year limited warranty yes
there's a sound capsule the magnetic
sound cut out the sound cut okay yeah
okay so the sound capsule and the
showerhead pairs wirelessly to bluetooth
enabled devices surround yourself with
sound for a unique cooler shower
experience and the magnetic sound
capsule provides up to seven hours of
runtime I mean if you're having a seven
hour shower I mean realistically I guess
it's meant so that you recharge it once
every sort of several months depending
on how often you shower just kidding on
several months you know once every
couple weeks when it actually runs out
of batteries but sorry I've lost track
with my hygiene joke now the point is
that you won't have to recharge it that
often but when you do is just a magnetic
pop in peace okay so it's a waterproof
thing so there's the oh hold on there's
a cover here so there's the actual
shower nozzles themselves it's kind of a
rubberized finish they're very nice
actually it's got very well it's nice
pop that in there's your speaker there's
presumably your pairing button there's
presumably your power button or
something I don't know what the buttons
are not to worry this is probably a hot
power plug it's a micro USB charging and
here is your micro USB cable which is
included for charging the device you
just leave your phone kind of outside
your shower which is probably where it's
sitting anyway and so what's their
tagline for this your music wants to
shower with you shower out loud I've got
Moxie and the bold look of Kohler
stickers are all included and I think
that without running this through
putting this through the paces in a
real-world setting
we're not really going to be able to
truly sort of communicate the experience
so for those of you who are faint at
heart and cannot unsee things that
you've seen it's probably best to tune
up now very briefly I'll show you guys
the chrome finish on the top of the
Moxie as well as the flexible showerhead
feature that it has there's going to
filter on there nothing replacing your
showerhead is pretty easy I actually
didn't know that it's easy because I've
never done it before but
Slick's apparently was a plumber in a
previous life or something like that so
there you go there's the existing shower
head which does not have a bluetooth
module and as they put it so well on Big
Bang Theory everything is better with
bluetooth now you can see there's some
some plumbing tape on here I will
replace this so you'll take this off you
wrap it around in the same direction as
the threads in order to make sure that
you have a good seal and it's not
leaking but other than that you can see
all you have to do is screw on the Moxie
and then you can see there's two flat
sides so you could use a wrench to
tighten it up a little bit if you want
it there you go
and you have installed it the pairing
process is pretty simple so all you have
to do is press and hold this button to
put the device in pairing mode and just
fire up bluetooth on your I'm I don't
know I don't know what he's talking
about but let's see if it shows up it's
possible that I didn't I didn't do it
for long enough scan for devices
yeah if Indiana Jones had Bluetooth in
his shower land that would be this would
be applicable say look why do you pull
your computer that it's dorky slicks
computer name it's like ridiculous okay
we should be in pairing mode give us a
minute we'll figure this out there we go
but picked up right after we turn off
the camera of course because that's how
these things go
so pairing and then let's uh let's fire
up some music here so crazy this is like
oh it's unhappy
some alright well let's see if this
works and then if not and not will
reshoot it so let's find out music and
