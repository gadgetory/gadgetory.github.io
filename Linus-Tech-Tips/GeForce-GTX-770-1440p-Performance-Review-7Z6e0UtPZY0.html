more 770 1440p review take 2 shot 1 now
if you're a regular viewer you've
probably heard me say before why are you
buying a high-end graphics card if
you're still connecting to your monitor
via VGA I would actually go further than
that now if you're spending a few
hundred dollars on a graphics card and
you're not running at a resolution
higher than 1080p you're probably doing
something wrong and you're probably miss
allocating your funds in some way
because monitors are so inexpensive now
they've got those cheap ones on eBay you
can get IPS panels for a few hundred
bucks for a 1440p display that you
should make that part of your upgrade
plan in order to have a better more
immersive gaming experience the GTX 770
is a direct replacement for the 670 and
comes in with a very similar spec to the
outgoing GTX 680 it's got that same full
fledged GK 104 core it's clocked higher
than the 680 by default using GPU boost
2 to achieve it's its own boosted
overclocked speeds and to make it
operate you know at a fixed temperature
and all the cool stuff that comes along
with GPU boost - it has a better cooler
that looks outstanding in addition to
keeping the card cool enough as well as
an updated fan profile that makes it
less less sy liable to ramp up and ramp
down in an annoying fashion so it's got
all that going for it but the big
improvement over GTX 680 from my
standpoint is the 7 gigahertz gddr5
memory on it so it's still using a 256
bit bus but the memory is clocked
substantially higher allowing for it to
perform better particularly at higher
resolutions as you are about to see now
we're using our usual standardized test
bench we've got our Intel Core i7 39 60
exit 4 gigahertz 16 gigs of Kingston ROM
a p9 x79 deluxe motherboard a 128 gig
SSD for our boot drive as well as the
latest drivers from both the green and
the red teams without further ado
let's get into the performance numbers
Metro last light is an unbelievably
demanding game at 1440p even the GTX
Titan and GTX 780 are brought to their
knees however their version of brought
to their knees is very different from
the rest of the cards you can see here
that memory bandwidth is king so those
cards do well the GTX 770 beats the card
that it's replacing as well as the card
that it is very similar to in terms of
spec except for its increased memory
bandwidth quite handily in this test
with both of the cards from the red team
also doing phenomenally well partly and
due to the fact that they have great
memory bandwidth and three gig memory
buffers as opposed to the two gig memory
buffers that we see on the Nvidia cards
that we have in this test in Tomb Raider
we see a hint of the things that we saw
in our 1080p performance review of this
card where it looks like the GPU boost
on this particular card isn't that
competitive with the way that our 680
turns up when overclocked remember we
overclocked all of our cards for our
performance testing so what that
revealed was that our gtx 770 is not
necessarily faster than our 680 once
both cards are overclocked to the max
I'm expecting this to change at some
point with some tweaks and I mean if
that's not the case I'm expecting most
770's to boost up higher than our
particular one because remember this is
a higher TDP card which means it can is
able to draw more power it has a higher
stock clock speed and it has that much
faster memory to go with it
with all of that said we've got GTX
Titan in GTX 780 in completely their own
world way atop of the graphs then we've
got a clustering of cards that are all
pretty much within margin of error of
the ones on either side of them followed
up by the gtx 660ti and the GTX 670 down
at the very bottom in BioShock Infinite
we see another example of gtx titan gtx
780 completely running away with it
stealing the show and everything else
looking like a very sort of clustered
grouping of cards once again though we
see our 770 in spite of the fact that we
did observe some
weird ramping of the core clock speed
pull ahead of the GTX 680 and it looks
like remember guys at higher resolutions
we're more dependent on memory
performance it looks like that memory is
really helping out the card here in Far
Cry 3 same pattern those top two cards
are the top two cards and everything
else is below them but we do see the 770
pull ahead not only of the 670 in a
pretty sort of impressive fashion but we
see it pull ahead of the GTX 680 as well
so we can attribute this to the improved
memory bandwidth once again moving on to
Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon remember these
are based on the same engine but have
very different demands on your system we
see again GTX Titan GTX 780 and
everything else very very close after
that with the GTX 770 being the only GK
104 based card that really separated
itself in this test we did rerun these
numbers and it's pretty bizarre and
we're not quite sure how we ended up
with the same performance with all three
of these cards especially at such a GPU
bound resolution but there you have it
the 770 was the only one that really
separated itself crysis 3 is another
game where we see the gtx 770 s very
incremental improvements over the last
generation geforce cards and we see GTX
Titan and GTX 780 just kind of stomping
all over everything just like they are
probably going to continue to do for a
while until AMD manages to launch some
kind of counter attack that can in some
way address the GTX 780 and GTX Titan so
what's the conclusion for this gtx 770
is very suitable for running at 1440p
just like gtx 680 was before it except
more so it looks better it's quieter not
only is it quieter but the way the fan
ramps up and down is less annoying you
get GeForce experience which allows you
to keep your drivers updated as well as
gives you recommendations for your game
settings which might not be relevant to
you but might be relevant to someone who
you recommend a card to if you know that
they can't handle
handling all that stuff on their own and
it comes in at a lower price than the
GTX 680 that it is inheriting most of
its technology from but not its looks
you get a card that looks very premium
sounds very premium performs very
premium and is suitable for gaming at
that resolution at a price point that it
wasn't available at before so it's
really hard to go wrong bear in mind
guys the numbers you were looking at in
this test were based on us running at
extremely high settings at that
resolution even with cards like the
Titan to get really smooth playable
frame rates you'd probably end up
turning things down from you know ultra
settings with anti-aliasing all over the
place because it is much more demanding
on your graphics card to run at a higher
resolution thank you for checking out my
