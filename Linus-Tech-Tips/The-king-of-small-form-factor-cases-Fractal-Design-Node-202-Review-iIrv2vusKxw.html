design node 202 we first checked out
this case quite some time ago at
Computex 2016 and have actually had it
in the office for a while but the
release has been a little Wong KO as in
to say actually buying the case has been
a bit of an issue seriously there is
even a reddit thread with people
discussing if it even exists now that it
does seem to exist for people looking to
buy it let's take a closer look I by
powers revolt 2 has been redesigned from
the ground up to utilize its small form
factor to hold the power you need to
game with confidence check out the link
in the video description to learn more
you can see right off the bat of the
form factor is quite small when laying
flat it has a width of 377 millimeters a
height of 146 millimeters and a depth of
47 millimeters this case is designed for
sfx power supplies up to 130 millimeters
long ITX motherboards and standard sized
graphics cards or 310 by 145 by 47
millimeters graphics cards that was a
lot of specific dimensions and there's a
reason for that the density of this case
is pretty damn high not the highest but
high enough that it doesn't really allow
for a ton of play in terms of what you
can put inside if you're interested in
this case you should be checking the
dimensions of the components that you're
planning to put inside of it this isn't
a shot at the case at all it's just a
heads up that you need to be aware of
its limitations during your planning
phase starting at the front of the case
you have two USB 3.0 Jack's in a black
finish dual audio jacks for your
headphone and microphone and an
illuminated power button just to the
right of said Jack's there's also a
fractal logo on the right hand side
which looks a little odd when you set
the case up vertically but fits right in
when it's placed flat looking around the
case is pretty standard fair fractal
went with an unsurprising matte finish
all around and definitely didn't skimp
on breathability with mesh area
scattered around everywhere that they
might be useful moving on to the inside
of the case we see an elegant yet
simplistic setup comprised of three main
zones the power supply
ize little area the motherboard split
off and the graphics cards whole section
all have their own kind of areas like I
said if you go for the option that
includes a power supply you'll be
equipped with a 450 watt Integra which
should be able to handle basically
everything modern that you would throw
inside this case the power supply area
also somewhat supports a little bit of
cable management room just in front so
you can stuff some of your extra cables
away and leave some breathing room for
the air coolers on your CPU and GPU you
will very likely need this cable
management area unless you plan on
stuffing all of the spare cables under
the graphics card because some of the
even included cables are hella long I
don't know why someone would need a USB
3.0 internal header cable that if you
stood to these cases beside each other
would be able to be plugged into the
other one
that being said at least it is a blacked
out cable if you do spring for the
included power supply and get the
included cables that are kind of
straight out of 2005 with colors all
over the place that may be a little bit
disappointing although it also may be
fair considering that there is a lack of
a side window the motherboard area is
fairly unsurprising although it does
support the start of the PCI Express
riser card you might notice that in the
gland footage that the screw holes for
ours are a little bit off feel free to
ignore this completely this is a
pre-production sample and they have
revised this part of the case so that
this is no longer an issue on the
graphics card side of the case you
naturally have the installation area for
the graphics card an angled support
bracket which you can move around to
support whatever kind of graphics card
you decide to put in there and some
shared room for the front IO cables
there's also a bunch of extra room under
the graphics card for support for 120
millimeter fans two of them straddling
the middle support bar of the case is an
SSD cage that you can mount two drives
in this cage is relatively easy to get
to the only drawback is that the cable
management of installing an SSD on the
graphics card side of the case is a
little messy there are fan filters but
some of them are rather difficult to get
to the filter for the power supply on
the GPU are only accessible if you take
the case apart completely I mean taking
the top off and the bottom off although
I must say that they are I am happy that
they're included and last but not
least is the stand it's fairly standard
fare sorry for the pun it's made out of
plastic and is actually quite solid it
does an adequate job of keeping the case
standing upright there's a little rubber
feet on the bottom four of them one in
each corner and they do an adequate job
of keeping it from sliding around the
desk
it looks fine but you can do something
that hardware conducts data in their
video which i think is quite awesome I'm
just going to call them out if you place
it down and then the put the case down
horizontal on top of it it makes it kind
of look like the case is levitating it
looks super cool in conclusion the note
202 is clean quite dense and even
slightly cheaper than the rv0 1 from
Silverstone in terms of positioning I
think fractal did a great job for price
and what you get with it
it didn't exactly knock my socks off but
I also wasn't expecting it to these
small ITX cases that still support full
sized graphics cards are actually quite
attractive right now and there's a fair
amount of them the idea that a tiny case
with a tiny GPU like an AR 9 nano is
awesome but still not catering to what
most people's desires are so I think
this was the right direction to go
thanks for watching guys if this video
sucks you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like

like this one with a direct monthly
contribution to the forum again I don't
know why you'd get to I just felt like
saying it twice it's probably fine if
you're wondering what to watch next

I really just definitely forgot to write
this part of the script so I'm gonna
give teryn a lake oculus versus vive
Taryn just said so it's going to be that
video there we go cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
