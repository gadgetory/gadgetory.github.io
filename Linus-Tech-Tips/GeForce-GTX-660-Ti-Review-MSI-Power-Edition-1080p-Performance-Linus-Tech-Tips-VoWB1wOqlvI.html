awful but this review isn't so this is
all about the g-force 660ti which is the
all-new Nvidia graphics card that is
coming in at a lower price point than
the GTX 670 which came in at a lower
price point than the GTX 680 but what's
crazy about this is that they're all
built on the same graphics whips core
technology which is the GK 104 core that
means you've got full support for
adaptive vsync you've got full support
for the latest anti-aliasing modes
including FXAA
and TxAA you've got GPU boost which is
very cool which basically just detects
how power-hungry the game you're running
is and if it happens to be a little bit
less power-hungry and it can squeeze
some more GPU frequency out of the core
and maintain the power threshold and
heat threshold that the card needs then
it will actually increase the clock of
your GPU giving you better fps in
real-world applications games so that's
really cool while it may not be as good
for benchmarking and burr mark which
most people don't need to do because
what you really want to do with the
graphic part is play games then I
totally vote for that technology so
there's a couple different cards that
we're looking at here today the one that
we did the bulk of the benchmarking on
is the gtx 660ti power edition from msi
however we also did take some readings
with the galaxy gtx 660ti GC with their
dual fan cooler so what we did find was
that due to the over Bolton capability
of the power Edition we were able to
overclock higher on this card
however the galaxy card did run
significantly cooler about seven degrees
cooler than the MSI card under a
realistic gaming load so in this case we
use Crysis 2 in order to get all of our
gaming low temperatures as well as our
gaming load power consumption and we are
using C which games do we test that we
tested Crysis 2 which or - skyrim which
didn't end up being very GPU limited at
all so you're not going
kind of pointless metro 2033 as well as
one other game which is escaping me
right now but maybe slick can remind me
and we are a Jed witchery battlefield 3
battlefield 3 so we did five games
finding out where these cards fall in
terms of performance so we did the 660ti
because that's the card of the day okay
650th yeah very important performance
numbers we did the 560 Ti because we
wanted to see how the new 660ti performs
compared to the card that it is
replacing in that sort of 250 to 300
dollar segmental though the 660ti comes
in at the high end of that segment we
did the 670 to find out how the 660ti
compares to its older brother so if you
want to shell out another hundred bucks
what do you get we did the Radeon HD
7870 and in this case we used a what is
this a hockey a hawk edition card
because it doesn't cost much more than a
regular 78 70 and we want to compare
real 660ti as you can buy two real cards
that you can buy on the market today to
compare it against we actually have a
sapphire 7950 that's running on that
test bench over there that we use to
compare because the 660ti falls right
between the 7870 and the 7950 in terms
of pricing but what you're going to see
is that at 1080p performance is actually
closer to a 7950 than it is to a 7870 so
that is the range of cards stick with me
guys and we're gonna walk through all
the performance numbers together of this
all new and very exciting graphics card
so we're gonna start with Crysis 2
benchmarks so you can see right here the
gtx 660ti power edition actually
performs as well or better than the 7950
dual-x from sci-fi remember this is an
overclocked factory overclocked 7950 and
dramatically outperforms the 7870 Hawk
it actually comes within spitting
distance this is a bit of an anomaly
this difference in the minimum fps so
the red bar is average and the blue bar
is minimum but you can see it performs
within about 10% of the 60s via beer
670 reference card which means that once
we overclocked this a little more we can
probably get pretty close I'm going to
be doing a separate video about
overclocking the 560 Ti gets destroyed
in every possible way so
you have one of these the 660ti is a
worthy upgrade it should be noted we're
running on the ultra highest presets at
1080p with medium motion blur and high
res textures enabled this is a custom
game run through every benchmark we do
is a run through in game recorded with
fraps we are not using any canned
benchmarks on this YouTube show
Battlefield 3 is another big win for the
660ti so this is that ultra presets and
this is a single-player gameplay guys we
are gonna do a separate video comparing
the gtx 660ti to the 7950 directly in
battlefield 3 multiplayer we've been
asked for that a lot of times so look
for that on my channel as well in the
next little while here and Slick's gonna
do some run throughs in a nice full
server where you can really see how
these perform in aid the most intensive
possible battlefield 3 scenario so
moving right along yeah big winner it
has a slightly lower dip in terms of
minimum FPS compared to the 7950 duel
but it should be noted that because
we're doing real run throughs you have
to take these minimum dips with a grain
of salt because you never know some
weird glitches can happen to the best of
graphics cards and you can't really
control that the 560 Ti gets its butt
handed to it thoroughly again I think a
big part of this is due to the fact that
it's only got 1 gig of video memory when
everything else here has two gigs three
gigs two gigs and two gigs and you can
once again see a 660ti plat power
Edition Hummels Platinum Edition can you
tell it can you tell I've been like
doing this a long time the last part
called Platinum Edition was an X 800 AGP
just and gets dangerously close to that
670 performance mark Skyrim with high
texture pack and abled also just
destroyed our 560 Ti this was not pretty
so let's uh let's sort of just you know
ignore that so we'll have a look at how
the 660ti did this is one where the 670
with its additional memory bandwidth
seemed to really pull away from the
660ti but even then the 660ti hung with
the 7950 as opposed to with the 78-74
witcher 2 you were using a slightly
custom configuration high spec with
verticals
disabled so that we can get the maximum
FPS mind you it never really close over
120 FPS anyway we're using the 120 Hertz
monitor so on this one you see that the
7950 dipped a little bit low this is not
representative it should be more like
probably in this range it was a bit of
an anomaly however we can still look at
the average FPS numbers and see that the
660ti PE for the first time landed
around where its price point is which is
between a seventy eight seventy and a
seventy nine fifty instead of running
right with the 79 50 which is a more
expensive GPU the six seven eight again
performs a little bit better than 660ti
so no real surprises here and once again
in Metro 2033 the gtx 660ti destroys the
card its replacing and it's not as close
to the 670 in this one but actually here
i'm going to cheat i'm going to show you
guys a preview from our overclocked
performance guide but you're gonna see
that in Metro 2033 the 660ti oh no it
still trails behind it in big way and
nitrifying okay forget it so it's it's
more like a seventy eight seventy in
terms of performance in this particular
title but I think this shows us a good
cross-section of which titles 660ti
performs more like a seventy nine fifty
and which titles it performs kind of
exactly where it's supposed to be and in
a worst case scenario performs about
like a seventy eight seventy which is
what the pricing is sort of closest to
if you don't factor in mail-in rebates
however if you factor in mail-in rebates
some of the 1770s are priced pretty
aggressively so I think that pretty much
wraps up if you want 3d vision if you
want and videos surround as opposed to
AMD eyefinity if you want physics then
you will have to go with the geforce
card and if you want the best price to
performance ratio right now for geforce
the 660ti is looking like it because it
just rocks the last generation stuff in
terms of performance without demanding a
huge premium on the price so thank you
for checking out this review for 1080p
performance of the gtx 660ti remember
we've got a couple here so there is an
sli performance review coming where
we're going to be comparing it directly
to a gtx 680 because all of a sudden
buying two of these is
not that much more expensive than buying
a single 680 so that's an interesting
scenario because they should perform
pretty well so we got two of them we'll
show them off bed and I think that
pretty much wraps it up don't forget to
