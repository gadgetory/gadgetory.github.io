encounter a computer or electronics
issue that's completely inexplicable for
example in the early 2000s I had a
machine that for some reason didn't
require the warcraft 3 disc to be loaded
in the optical drive I wasn't using an
OCD crack and the issue I'm not going to
call it a problem because it was very
convenient the issue persisted over
multiple reformats Andry installations
of the game only to go away when I
upgraded the computer but the point of
this video is not for me to tell old
stories from a million years ago because
I'm old the point of this video is that
thanks to the power of video recording
and the internet I can now share with
you these experiences welcome to episode
1 of what we're calling haunted hardware
Tunnel Bear is the simple VPN app that
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet to try tunnel
bear for free check out the link in the
video description so you're sitting
there at home thinking
- there's nothing haunted about running
Doom on a computer it's supposed to work
that way the game is scary or not scary
whatever the case may be no no the
haunted thing about what you're looking
at right now is this fraps counter up
here in the top left corner that's not
supposed to be there now if I was
running an OpenGL mode that would be
fine but look at this settings advanced
Vulcan for contrast this is how it is
supposed to work this is my normal
desktop test bench with a GTX 1080 we go
into settings advanced opengl 4.5 boom
FPS counter is working now if we switch
to Vulcan doom will restart and we'll
fast forward through this if it drags
out for too long for you guys and my
camera person will hold kind of steals
but really you can already see okay we
are switched over to Vulcan my FPS
counter is gone fraps is still very much
loaded in the system tray it just
doesn't work that way fraps isn't
designed to work with either of the new
lower level API s that is Vulcan or
DirectX 12 that what you just saw there
is the normal expected behavior so it's
at this stage in any troubleshooting
process that the good old sanity check
comes in so you go into your settings
you go this is a really cool feature of
doom it's like it's almost like it's
made by people who care you go show
performance metrics and you go okay is
it actually running Vulcan did yes
it would appear so okay but if we were
running in borderless window mode it is
possible that fraps could overlay itself
in some way so what we need to do is go
into the console and this is another
great thing that do has and good games
all have and we can have a look at what
commands we have we go okay vid restart
okay you saw that black flash no the
game is running 1920 by 1080 fullscreen
so the next logical step let's check our
software revisions maybe nvidia has a
driver or do released an update or a de
fraps has a new version something of
which enables this functionality so
nvidia driver 21 21 13 72 70 got it do
build one twenty seven twenty nine
ninety two and fraps is version three
point five point nine nine let's go
double check all that stuff over on the
desktop here we've got that same driver
revision it's great even though we're
running a different graphics card
there's the same architecture running
the same driver doom is running that
exact same build which makes sense
because I've always got auto update
enabled and steam and finally fraps is
running that same three point five point
nine nine in fact here's a fun fact it
didn't realize this until I was working
on this video
fraps hasn't even been updated since 26
and February 2013 so for them to have
introduced a patch that enables this
functionality seems very very unlikely
considering the last patch fixed arrow
desktop and DirectX 10 games so then
it's at this point that we start getting
into the troubleshooting steps that take
a little bit longer we're going to do a
full reinstall of our driver as well as
doomed downloading a completely fresh
copy of the game off of steam just in
case there is some weird corruption
that's not allowing it to properly
launch in Vulcan mode for example to get
rid of our video card driver we're going
to be using DD you I'm not going to go
through all the steps in you know
explicit detail but basically you reboot
in safe mode you runs edu you download a
fresh copy of the drivers off Nvidia and
install that and try again and we're
back in game now with fresh drivers
fresh copy of the game and exactly the
same behavior we saw last time so at
this point it's time to take it to the
next level
we are going to do a fresh format of
this PC we're going to go back to bone
stock then we're going to update the
drivers then we're going to install the
game and see if it persists now I
suspect it's running an OpenGL mode out
of the box it's not something you can
configure when you launch the game for
Doom so everything here looks hunky-dory
totally normal opengl 4.5 we have fraps
okay advanced Vulcan yes
eleven hundred frames per second haunted
right haunted haunted computer Vulcan
1.0 point one three framerate counter
working even though it shouldn't and the
game is loading now I did observe that
OpenGL Vulcan regardless of what API it
was running performance did look a
little bit low there so I'm going to
remove another variable I'm going to
disable the onboard graphics here
disabling this will cause it to stop
functioning yeah I think that's good I
would sure hope so and what I'm going to
do now is to determine once and for all
whether we have magic fraps or broken
game I am actually going to do our
benchmark run with each different
readout here and see if they perform
differently
okay so settings we're going to triple
confirm them blah blah blah blah blah
full-screen blah blah blah advanced
Vulcan definitely everything is Wow Wow
windows okay I'm not going to run the
whole benchmark because quite frankly
the difference between Vulcan and
OpenGL at this resolution on this
hardware should be pretty much
immediately noticeable so we're getting
about 70 frames per second talking to
this guy respectfully so that's fine
let's go ahead settings advanced OpenGL
restart okay here we go no way okay hold
on just a second here what the just
happened okay
so at this point in the video I was kind
of expecting the conclusion to be haha
it's just running OpenGL because the
game isn't launching in Vulcan Mode but
what we appear to have gotten instead
and I don't have another 1060 equipped
laptop to compare against unfortunately
but what we what we appear to have
gotten instead is magical fraps running
on a magical machine magically working
on Vulcan even though there is
absolutely no way and I'm sure the fraps
developers would be happy to call me up
and tell me this personally there's
absolutely no way that this is working
so this is the kind of that I go through
all I wanted all I wanted was a
performance comparison between this
laptop and this laptop for my review of
this laptop this is what I'm dealing
with
so if you were wondering when you saw
the review of this laptop which will
perhaps come out before this video why
there was no Vulcan doom testing now you
know I'm not blaming this laptop in fact
I probably won't even mention it because
it's probably not this laptops fault
because I've seen this kind of bit
before I'm just happy that for once I
got to share the experience with you
guys you know I'm really glad that
FreshBooks is the ad spot on this video
because have you guys ever been dealing
with some kind of accounting thing like
