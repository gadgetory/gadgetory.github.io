brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
darn screen protectors out there as well
as hyper x so we wanted to talk about
the G flex 2 but you can see behind me I
can't get anywhere near this freaking
table everybody's looking at it
everyone's walking all over the place so
we had to track down someone from LG and
I was like do you even know who I am and
they were like yeah whoa totally you're
lying to start you that's not how it
happened at all actually but I did
manage to get my hands on a G flex 2
here so this is looking a lot better
than the g flex one that I first saw
last year and one of the things that I
noticed right away when I picked it up
is that similar to what we've seen ever
since the g2 I believe was the first one
to do this we've still got the volume
and lock button on the back in a place
is actually quite natural and
comfortable for a larger phone like this
but unlike the G flex one which had kind
of this this curve that was designed
around the curve of the screen and not
around the curve of your hand they've
changed it up so it fits nicely in your
hand but the screen has its own
completely separate curve so it feels
natural to your eyes as well now whether
or not you sort of buy into the whole do
we benefit from a curved screen on
something this small is totally up to
you and it's something that you're going
to have to try for yourself I haven't
actually done a full review of a flex
device before but who knows maybe
that'll happen in the future right LG
but the specs of the phone are looking
pretty darn good it's got a snapdragon
810 processor it's an octa-core that's 8
cores but I don't have any idea if
that's aight high-performance cores or
for power saving ones and for
high-performance ones or anything like
that it'll be available in variance with
two or three gigs of ram different types
of storage it's got an oled display that
looks absolutely beautiful and 1080p
which not sure exactly why they're doing
that since they were one of the actually
I believe they were the first to do a
1440p phone with the g3 but i definitely
understand why they might want to
because with oled you're going to get
some power savings and by going with a
lower resolution display you're going to
get some power savings there as well for
something that i don't personally
believe really benefits the user going
above 1080p speaking of power the
battery is 3,000 milliamp hours they've
made a couple of other upgrades as well
it's got a 2.1 megapixel selfie camera a
13 megapixel rear camera
that selfie camera gets a couple of
gesture upgrades so we've still got the
whole go like this to start the
countdown timer thing to start your
selfie but now just by moving the phone
down you can actually preview it as well
they also wanted me to show you guys
this one it's not the best glance for
notifications implementation I've ever
seen but you can drag down from the top
in order to preview your notifications
not too shabby and definitely something
that those of you who don't already have
smartwatches will find will come in
handy so I don't have any kind of
confirmation as to when this will be
available in canada at the very least
but looking pretty nice and actually has
a much much nicer feel than the previous
one in spite of the plastic back which
by the way has their next-generation
self-healing technology so we first saw
this on the g flex where they were doing
demos they had like wire brushes going
all across the backs of the phones and
they were healing in a matter of minutes
now it starts to heal in a matter of
about 10 seconds meaning that you can
throw it in your purse throw it in your
pocket with your keys or whatever else
and it's going to look nice not only on
the front where it's got Gorilla Glass
but also on the back where it's got that
self-healing tech that's not the only
cool thing though under the back you
take it off you've got microSD expansion
something that some phone manufacturers
are really shying away from and others
are embracing and I'm glad to just know
that LG is totally embracing it because
you've got support for micro SD cards up
to two terabytes which is completely
bananas so I actually have to I have to
put this down for a second and give a
quick shout-out to our sponsor so our
first monster is phantom glass these
guys make freaking awesome screen
protectors they're Gorilla Glass 3 so
they have that same scratch resistance
that same clarity and thats a nice feel
to your finger as the rest that's the
regular screen on your phone except that
you don't have to worry about damaging
it speaking of not worrying about
damaging things and they're available at
stores off phantom dog glass you guys
are going to want to check them out
there are pretty much impossible to
apply with a bubble underneath also want
to do a quick shift out out quick
out wow that was awkward for hyperx
hopefully they don't mind me screwing
that up youtube.com slash hyperx they've
got a lot of great gaming content over
there those guys have a great sense of
humor though so hopefully they're going
to just roll with that or not watch this
