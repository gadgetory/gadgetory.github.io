focused the camera before the show
before the show not during the show and
I'm pretty sure that we got it right but
then again this is coming from the same
person who was pretty sure we had it
right all those other times so welcome
to the Wynn show guys we've got a great
show for you guys today I'm gonna be
having James and potentially some of the
other writers join me one of them is
actually working on the review of
something really really exciting that's
me
int she's not working on anything
exciting are you someone finally said it
you get all the like monitors and stuff
I got good stuff I like like what I like
working on the Bigsby thing yes okay yes
actually bad it's gonna be a good topic
for later we're gonna be talking about
line is showcase tips which is not the
internal code word for it but is
definitely what we're gonna be calling
it externally you made me delete that I
did I made you delete I made you delete
the internal code word messed it lest it
leaked from our from our facility here
and James can talk about sort of what
he's working on I can talk about what
all that's going to mean we also have
some updates on legitimately exciting
products or at least rumors on them
including Intel's upcoming Z 370 chipset
and coffee-like CPUs and in other news
ok you do one let's see if you can do it
right this time
mmm AMD is killing crossfire done single
card only for now on not true that's not
when Luke and I get this crap wrong the
excuse is that we haven't actually
looked at the document yet if you've
worked on it it's a joke it's called the
joke they're still gonna have multi-gpu
they're just not calling it you've seen
the comments on our writing lately our
writers shouldn't be making jokes I
didn't see the comments oh you know it's
funny though too because a lot of the
time you guys actually get crap for
stuff that I added to your scripts after
the fact oh you're the worst
let's roll the Israel
and everyone says Luke looks weird
but it's weird because you're not
leaving not yet not yet it's one thing
if designer babies men CRISPR decide
your behaviors I could get into that
all right that's someone who has a baby
yeah like if I could like make my
children slightly better wouldn't I you
you're lucky your kids are likely to not
ever watch this yeah it's the odds of
them watching this episode of the wine
show are pretty low then again I mean I
I I don't really
hmm maybe this is the wrong place to
talk about this but I really get why
people watch the wind show hmm did you
ever watch the wind show before you
worked here yeah a little bit
really okay why did you watch the wind
show well good question I was scrolling
through the list of LTTE uploads and I
accidentally and then and then I
suffered from partial paralysis for 30
minutes
honestly I washed it for Luke so it's
just gone to shit now yeah you and
everyone else all right so why don't we
jump into our first topic today you know
what I'm sure this one has got everybody
wondering what the hell it is we're
talking about this was posted on the
forum by syntax vgm in the original
article here is from PC world and
naturally I didn't check my oh I didn't
know didn't plug in my aged oh I'm sorry
I just hit the mic of all bad people
they're throwing headphones rip rip
everyone with headphones I'm sorry you
guys there we go
boom that's what it looks like so AMD
Radeon phases out crossfire the
crossfire brand that is as multi-gpu
gets more complicated
so in a nutshell what's going on here
they're just not saying crossfire
anymore instead they're saying MGP you
for multi-gpu not to be confused with
mobile GPU and they're doing this for a
reason related to DirectX because
apparently crossfire relates
specifically to dx11 applications do you
know I hope that yeah so I can you can
you drop this on us okay so first of all
crossfire the branding has always been
confusing AMD has used the crossfire
brand for everything from ancient X 800
class cards with like these weird master
slave DVI dongle nonsense things hooked
up to them all the way to no
master/slave relationship to three or
even four cards running in tandem with
these bridges connected to them more
progressive and then and then they added
an X for like you know it's the usual
thing x4 extreme x4 that X Factor x4
cross fire again more crosses you don't
like this you know what try this you
know what I don't even I don't even I
don't even need I don't even need all
the comments about how I should get rid
of you and bring back Luke I want to get
look trust me no we all want Luke to be
we all want Luke to be here okay James
more than anyone because he gets to be
in the same building as Luke when Luke
is here doing the show um by 720 those
comments say I'm okay thank you
and visit there's still a chance and if
my doctor got 5% on his exam well D I
wouldn't be here to tell you about what
if my doctor got 5% on his exam discount
Luke its Kelly
Yvonne's pregnant again okay so wow that
would be complicated okay so basically
they've branded a bunch of different
things a bunch of different ways
crossfire has even been used to describe
running a craptastic AMD add-in card
with the onboard graphics on your
motherboard
to make it slightly less craptastic and
it never made any sense it was always
stupid but that's not to say that all
crossfire was always stupid that
particular one was always stupid but
this branding has always been really
confusing so now they're getting rid of
the crossfire brand and if you want my
honest opinion I am I think it's just
because they don't want to take
responsibility for it when it just
doesn't work but what does it have to do
with api's okay so what it has to do
with api's is that directx12
and vulcan are going to support
multi-gpu rendering in a different way
than previous api's so with direct exes
nine to eleven the way that SLI and
crossfire worked was via proprietary
means enabled through the graphics card
manufacturer so the game engine did have
to support it but it didn't actually
have to be explicitly coded in by the
game developer so you could actually
take a game let's say it use the Unreal
Engine for example you could take some
random game by some indie developer
using the Unreal Engine and even if you
had two cards and you got no performance
benefit from SLI or crossfire or
whatsoever no scaling no scaling at all
what you could do is a lot of the time
you could go into your Nvidia control
panel you could manually enable some
form of multigp rendering rendering
rendering be it alternate frame
rendering or I mean that's the most
that's the most common one and you could
apply up or you could apply a profile
from a similar game also using the
Unreal Engine and boom you would have
SLI or crossfire scaling and a lot of
the time it would actually work okay to
the extent that it worked when it comes
to DirectX 12 that's just not a thing so
the way that it's meant to be
implemented with DirectX 12 in
particular is by the game developer so
they are supposed to actually code into
the game how it would utilize multiple
GPUs in theory this would actually give
you the flexibility to mix and match
graphics cards in practice
I personally think that this is
basically the end of multi-gpu outside
of a very small number of niche games
where the developer bothers to code it
in because that's how it is that's how
it is right now there's only options of
singularity Tomb Raider there's only a
handful does Tomb Raider even scale well
with M GPU I don't even well it does
better under X 12 and 11 okay well
there's only a few that do that so so so
pretty much there will be those games
that are as much benchmarks as they are
games where they actually put all of
this support into it because what
they're trying to do is get like tech
publications to use their game as a
benchmark which is basically free
advertising for the game so as far as I
can tell a lot of game developers have
finally clued in to the idea that
putting a baked in benchmark in the game
is pretty much getting marketing for a
small investment in development time not
to mention that it's just convenient for
the user no kidding
doom doom is the only newish game that
we're featuring at all in all of our
videos are still showing Deus Ex 1 2014
yeah so so basically that's what I think
I think AMD is changing the branding
because they just don't want to be
associated with it not working and what
is MGP you really even new branding or
multi-gpu
it seems just more like the name for it
well that's exactly it is there they're
almost there almost d branding it
speaking of e brand this episode is
brought to you right now actually so
it's almost like they're just removing
all their branding from it so that they
have to take no responsibility
whatsoever when the experience sucks
because game developers don't bother
because even now with the relatively and
to be clear I'm not saying that it's not
a lot of work to like make a game or
whatever even what the relatively small
amount of work that a developer has to
put in in order to have SLI or crossfire
work properly a lot of games it's like
really broken so asking them to go
several steps further and code it right
in
the game yeah we'll see I think you're
right it just gonna be over if
everyone's not doing it
there's no way would you ever make that
investment since it's the same cost as
upgrading your card you need me for two
minutes oh wow
apparently you're on your own for two
minutes ah again why don't you talk
about it Oh Microsoft officially killed
off no you don't want to talk about
Microsoft killing this is your baby I'm
talking about WeChat and the Chinese
government WeChat in the Chinese
government don't get political no no I
don't need to get political you put this
in you we have that we have the best
non-political podcast the best I called
up my friends and they told me we had
this huge
it was the banner if ik the best the
greatest earlier this week we chat
confirmed WeChat is a giant app in the
in China it's like what's up a bit but
it's more of a super app you can buy
stuff on it I think it has mapping and a
marketplace and stuff like that huge in
China
WeChat this week confirmed what everyone
was already thinking and that is that it
actually sends a lot of its users
personal data right to the ruling regime
the Chinese government so reading from
the page here which I didn't do last
week too awful effect WeChat has over
660 million users and in a recent
privacy statement confirmed that
virtually all of the private user
information will be disclosed to the
Chinese authorities this became known
during a recent update to the app users
were required to accept the update or to
accept the privacy policy in order to
get the update and in that policy
it basically says all your base are
belong to us now there's a couple scary
parts to this hey max you sit down
get in here no we don't want you you
know that's the post - era you let's
just get rid of James okay let's see it
right okay no we're strong do this to me
oh no we're not gonna do it yet we're
not gonna dare you we're gonna strop
pull it we're gonna strop pull it I
didn't agree with the comments last week
that said Linus was a harsh mean boss
but I'm on your side now James nor max
okay so it's
I'm out of here you're lucky it's not
5:45 okay okay let's go ahead and create
this poll here okay let me just say one
thing I'm dropping this in twitch chat
dropping this twitch okay guys guys hold
on you got it
you guys got it you guys gonna hit the
the straw poll for me here okay
straw poll straw poll okay I can't get
the real girl talk about the wechat
thing so flaccid here's the weird thing
about this Beijing okay the Chinese
government has announced that their
regulations will mandate that we chat
users will be liable and prosecuted for
any information posted in the group that
the government considers objectionable
ie
if you send a message to your buddy ago
some something the government does not
agree with and that gets read by the
authorities you can just go to jail
that's pretty dumb hey have you heard
about Tiananmen Square I just like
stumbled upon this web site that I
shouldn't have been on and learned about
it the authorities find that out you
just black helicopters going to jail I
mean theoretically it could happen a
little tin foil howdy but is it we're
not guaranteeing that it would happen
but I I think that to say that this is
anything other than deeply disturbing
would be would be objectively incorrect
it may not happen but if the language is
vague then it could happen and that's
what's scary yeah all right so let's go
ahead and have a look at the results
here No so let's so screenshare Wow
76% Mac's 24% Lynas so James gets zero
votes with the head zero voting
whatsoever he's you are sent you done
goofed
can you believe James got zero percent
of the vote
you voted James you are clearly full of
crap because there is no James option on
the poll which I did on purpose it's all
James okay okay max come on in you're
doing a topic 75% 75% of the audience
wants max to come in okay let's see - do
you want do you want it no no no you're
out you're out okay so max do you want
do you want like a softball topic or do
you want like a no I don't mean
literally softball sports either okay no
I mean like I meant like an easy topic
not actually like you know I do you know
that kind of thing uh or do you want
like a hardcore tech topic oh no no you
really don't
okay we're on a softball yes okay how
about um let's see razor confirms
development of a gamer oriented mobile
device mm-hmm so what he said okay hold
on hold on okay what about like the
Amazon echo okay I literally do how does
this format work okay um USB Group
announced us announces USB 3.2 where are
you seeing okay okay so she's more of a
camera person uh here why don't we go
with let's go with Polaroids new camera
okay okay let's talk about Polaroids new
camera it's not actually on the dog but
we can we can discuss this okay okay the
original article here is from the verge
the first Polaroid instant camera in a
decade is according to the verge
adorable this is it mrs. the Polaroid
camera can you imagine in this day and
age spending $100 on a Polaroid camera
bearing in mind that we're not talking
it looks like a Polaroid camera by the
way she should come a little closer do I
smell bad no I'm just like you're just
you're out of the frame camera person
but the frame concept she's still
working on the camera no III know it's
confusing is yeah okay
so bearing in mind it doesn't just look
like a Polaroid camera like an adorable
digital camera this is actually a
Polaroid camera the I type film packets
are $16 per pack for 8 color or
black-and-white exposures
it's rough does have a place in 2017
okay well film is huge now like I have a
film camera it cost $16 for you to
develop and get digital prints like
emailed to you or whatever don't do that
okay I'm glad we are talking about this
what the hell uh yeah no it's just like
it's a look you don't I mean like it has
like a specific like feel to it and
there's like it's just it's just the
thing it's just the thing that you do so
it's like an artsy art scene in thing
yeah I get I guess yeah okay okay so
then but what about the Polaroid camera
that's really expensive sixteen dollars
two dollars a photo uh yeah and that's
probably US dollars so we're talking
like two dollars and thirty Canadian
rupees that's two forty two point four
Canadian rupees whatever it works out -
yeah no see that's okay but what about
the kid okay because if we're gonna talk
about taking a picture with a specific
type of camera just to get like a filmic
aesthetic that like all the cool kids
are doing don't you think all the cool
kids could get into polaroid cameras
instant we didn't see cameras have been
around like literally always we have
those little cute ones you know the
little like color pastel ones and they
come out with like the tiny you know I
hate you young people instant cameras
have been around literally always do you
know how much that hurts literally
always since I was born anyway Brandon
and I actually like went Hasse's on this
Polaroid printer that he's gonna go get
okay alright okay tell me about it okay
so you have like this app on your phone
yeah and you can choose any photo from
this app and thanks vana yeah thank you
yeah carry on
so yeah you basically like connect us to
your phone via bluetooth okay and then
you choose any photo you want yeah on
your phone and then you like you can
even like add filters like they're
little things that you can do you put
straight from your Instagram on
that thing is incredible and it has like
it's those little ones it's like the
half sized ones yep so you called it
Polaroid but it's actually made by Fuji
film gotta go okay so so basically how
much does this cost is this it's just an
inkjet printer early ISM 150 200 so 200
bucks and then how much are the refills
ten four twelve ten four and is that
canadian rupees or is that okay soso
about eight dollars us for what ten or
twelve exposures yeah it is so okay so
as long as you're gonna print more than
a hundred and twenty pictures this is a
better value yeah plus you get to choose
which one you wanted like print so you
could take like a million selfies on
your phone right and then you pick the
right one and you print it out you're
like oh I casually first try but nobody
has to know
you know we can add filters and whatever
like I said so so if I'm to understand
the sort of the the artsy person
perspective on this the problem with the
Polaroid camera is that you might frame
your selfie wrong and that's the
advantage of this it's just like I don't
know I think it's better it's definitely
more portable as well then like you know
like when is VHS coming back never are
you sure
like how sure are you that my HS is not
because because if we need little mini
photo printers like this and if Polaroid
is releasing a new instant film camera
but like that's you can decorate with
that and it's like physical memories
that you can give to your friends are
not going to give you a friend of VHS
put tape because then they need a VHS
player you know this is just title it's
like the player is your eyeballs all
right I've had enough of your crap
Colton you know what a VHS is alright I
dropped your printer thing that you
wouldn't have seized on okay all right
well thank you max that was fun and
basically no Polaroid camera no right no
help you're thinking about it now it's
growing on you I I knew it I knew this
is gonna happen they have ones that you
can get it like Nordstrom I say that
something dies yeah sure sure that you
can like buy that they're like
refurbished there about 150 us and those
are like legitimate if you're really
gonna go hipster you shouldn't buy like
the new ole cuz it looks like a toy if
you're gonna get a Polaroid camera so
you know so the issue is not the
Polaroid camera it looks kind of silly
the issue is the look of the camera yeah
that too because if you want to do it
you gotta look cool and it genuinely
does look like like one of those fake
ones that you would give two or three
year old yeah oh yeah sure take photos
see this this is why this is why I don't
get it a lot of the time I get all
wrapped up in like specs and megapixels
and like camera lunchtime and blah blah
blah and I ignore things like well this
trendy retro camera is sort of real
retro and this trendy retro camera is
like not real retro so cool yeah did you
just and I think we're both destroyed at
this point Thank You max James you can
come back Linus doesn't get it confirmed
says twitchchat perfect that's what I
need on my Friday thanks max not too out
hipster max but I don't think you can
buy a hipster camera at Nordstrom a
corporate chain we need to go to a
vintage stores would be a real hipster
she doesn't live in Vancouver who cares
oh lordy okay alright let's move on to
our next topic um what did you want to
talk about you said oh you wanted to
talk about Microsoft officially killing
off Skype for business
okay the original particle here is from
the birds all right I know you were
really passionate about this topic James
Microsoft teams is replacing Skype for
business to put more pressure on
competitor slack all right fill us in I
know this this one was really dear to
your heart and even fun do you have you
used teams question number one no I
haven't used teams okay
our office is not moving two teams I
don't think no it's not okay do you have
a burning hatred for Skype for business
I do are you yes I do
why is that okay so the problem with
Skype for business is that it's not
actually Skype is that okay yes there's
that one it is for business so they have
that going for them are we a business we
are a business but we are a business
that actually has office 365
subscriptions for all of its members but
office 365 doesn't include Skype for
business unless you get the stupid
premium one mmm
so Skype for business was kind of like
the social network that requires
everyone else to be on the same social
network except it was expensive and it
had no benefit as far as I could tell
over other options
apparently teams is giving slack some
sweat
yak slack is via they're actually giving
them sweat I don't like this really
wedding and then they're going over to
the the slack office and they're like
here's our sweat that is disgusting you
are disgusting
okay so I think that slack basically had
all the market share and when I say that
they're sweating I don't mean that like
it's 50/50 now it to Microsoft teams
exists no like let's be honest but it's
enough and they're getting some cool new
features so the ability to hold calls
the ability to transfer calls they're
getting voicemail which is like it's
like it's like what are we gonna do away
with voicemail and go back to little
analog tapes that fit in your answering
machine when with my Apple watch be a
watch and audio conferencing so I don't
think I've never used slack that way
maybe the group checking does does slack
have voice calling or I've only ever
used the chatting and there's there's
BOTS to my knowledge slack doesn't have
voice calling so this is sounds like
it's like Skype plus slack so if they
out
trip flocking lots of ways they claimed
up their unveil to have 125,000
businesses using teams like in the first
six months of rollout okay so no they
apparently they apparently you can make
calls and slack so I know Luke uses
slack I actually I wish far more than I
already did that Luke was here because
Luke actually has extensive experience
with slack and he has been using it with
the floatplane team for quite some time
but yeah there you go you can make calls
and pretty much the problem with Skype
for business aside from just not really
having a compelling value add and not
being inter compatible with Skype that's
the biggest thing like the fact that you
had to go and install Skype for business
on your computer then the the login
didn't cross over either and how
confusing is that when they share the
same name if you've never used or heard
of Skype for business before and someone
says they're gonna call you on it yeah
you the time for the meaning arrives you
log in your skype and you're like where
are they that literally happened here
that literally has happened to me quite
a few times because as using Skype for
business would only ever come up if the
other business happened to be like stuck
on Skype for business
like everyone else just uses something
that you can call into like what's
what's their fate like GoToMeeting or
whatever yeah where you can just call in
with a landline or you can call in with
whatever but Skype for business I think
you're gonna be able to get that booty
music so yeah so teams is looking like
so it's actually using the same back-end
as Skype for business but it's going to
be losing the Skype branding and it's
gonna be getting some some fun new
features so Skype for business is gonna
be around for the next one year yeah
October 2018 and it's gonna be
interoperable with teams throughout that
period so that's kind of nice for like
the ten people who use Skype for
business what the heck are people
talking about well everyone wants max
back by the way of course um it's
better-looking than me stream for
YouTube is down stream for YouTube is
down what I am so confused I am so very
confused right now
you know you twitch at people you guys
are adorable alright let's talk about
something James really wants to talk
about this Ness many hmm so this was
originally posted overall by WM groom a
K on the forum and the original article
is from overclocked 3d dotnet it looks
like Nintendo's Ness mini may actually
use the same hardware as the Ness mini
the exact same so we might be just
getting a new shell some new game roms
and actually the same hardware check out
this picture like wow people are upset
so why are they upset two reasons okay
number one everything here makes sense
from Nintendo's perspective yes but just
doesn't make sense of Courtenay the laws
of the universe the nest the senesce
know the nest mini classic like the last
one got cancelled now we know that that
didn't actually have to happen because
they obviously are they're still making
the same parts in the same fabs they
didn't have to make it an exclusive
limited time only thing but they did
they just hate money as far as I can
tell no this takes you more money it's
like why doesn't macaws have the rib
which all the time no it doesn't make
you more money
it has influxes of demand when it comes
out well yeah but that assumes that
they're gonna re-release the Ness mini I
think it says that they will it may not
be in the notes but I think like next
summer they're gonna do that again
the the second reason is that they could
have made the super Ness all the time
the whole time they have the hardware
records it to make the Super Nintendo
and only now they're giving it to us
okay so a thing we want to throw up all
the time we could have had and if we
still want now we can't have anymore
but Nintendo has the power and we're
like their prisoners okay so I'm gonna
okay I'm gonna play devil's advocate a
little bit here what was your first
argument again now remember I wasn't
really paying attention they cancelled
products yes they so they stopped
production of the Ness mini so I okay
yeah I really don't have a justification
for the
okay as for the senesce mini not being
released right away that makes a ton of
sense because from a marketing
perspective you want to you want yeah
you want to have products to roll out
you want people to have something to
spend their disposable income on this
month and then if you release
you're basically fighting yourself don't
make them choose yeah
don't make them choose you know wait
till they've gotten a few more paychecks
and then release something else the
other side of that argument that I'm
gonna devil's advocate a little bit here
is that while obviously Nintendo didn't
run out and like develop a bunch of new
games for this Ness mini because that
would be besides the point um it's not
like there wasn't gonna be some
development they had to do because this
is now this is not a janky ROM running
on Zed smash on your old laptop that
doesn't even have a modem in it so
literally copying like roms over on that
16 Meg thumb drive that one of your
friends in high school gave you because
he's a super cool dude and he like you
know went back to China before we had
USB thumb drives here in North America
one here one well because anyway the
point is you know this this is not some
you know and all right so then you have
to use your USB Drive on your desktop to
copy your roms over to this laptop and
then you take the laptop around with you
but it actually doesn't really have like
a working battery anymore so you have to
be plugged in you know totally
hypothetical story this is it's gonna
work good it's supposed to work properly
so they actually do need to spend some
time presumably doing some testing
making sure everything is smooth now to
be clear it's not like you know nass or
snow simulators running on you know arm
CPUs is anything new at all but there's
just some validation to be done before
they can actually release a product like
this they've got to create box art which
you know you might not think about as a
consumer in terms of like
whatever it's it's boxer who cares you
throw some art on a box like what's
wrong with you but you actually have to
factor in okay you know which company is
producing it what colors and what right
can they put the the Nintendo seal foil
on it can they do this can they do that
when can when can they meet the order
when can they print them when will that
be delivered to the factory to be
packaged to like there's a lot and if
you're a business entity with limited
resources and you're just gonna take
this workload and spread it out over
time so the way to do that is have all
go in and then the next one not to
mention that there's things like FCC
validation that you or ul certification
that you have to go through for any
electronic device and you're gonna
you're just gonna kill yourself trying
to do everything all at once and then
like so try to do like design all the
hardware all at once and then try to
build all the sava flow they can do all
the harder all the ones yes that they
did and then try to build all the
software and all the UI crap and do all
the validation at once and then their
marketing deal with all the submissions
for like regulatory approval all at once
let me do all the marketing all it's not
stupid so you think they're working on a
little tiny n64 I hope so and would be
pretty cool although snez is as the as
sort of the console of my childhood
actually that is my favorite clones but
there are other childhoods that came
after yours yeah but I don't care about
those mmm so my my nostalgia has been
totally taken care of at this point
follow-up question if they did a release
of a little n64 which means they're
manufacturing new controllers do you
think they would still have the joystick
that had this string that got loose you
know the n64 controller choice it got
loose over time and it sucked or do you
think that they would modernize that in
that implementation and if they did
would it change how you played those old
games
you know what I don't know if Nintendo
would admit they ever did it wrong and
if they did it differently wouldn't it
kill the nostalgia like I okay so this
this is really gonna be polarizing this
is almost strawpoll okay listen let's
hit something that's gonna be divisive
like if you're gonna nostalgia out on
n64 do you want to go to your buddy's
house and he gives you the crappier
controller that's loose in your Oh or do
you want to be an even playing field
like you should have been in an all all
the time okay so I'm creating the pool
and then while we wait for people to
respond to the pole why don't we go
ahead and hit them with some sponsors
boom I just sponsor number one today oh
wow my favorite fresh box book so fresh
books is the super simple to use
invoicing tool for small businesses
everywhere its cloud-based it runs on
your computer or even on your phone with
all the functionality available to you
whether you're running iOS or Android it
lets you track your time with their
timesheet function manage your expenses
and even keep track of who owes you
money
you can send professional-looking
invoices in seconds and you can see once
your client has seen your invoice for
the first time so whether you are you
know running a small-time computer
repair shop or whether you're developing
a mobile app in your spare time and
trying to make it and then you end up
having to get a job at Linus Media Group
because it wasn't he wasn't going
anywhere or no comment are you still
working on the mobile app not really not
officially technically a Vinod really
fresh books has got you taken care of so
head over to fresh books calm / win and
enter when in the how did you hear about
us section when you sign up for your
free trial bringing us to our second
so tell me something doing it on
tell me something James on a scale of 1
to you know got blackout drunk at prom
and woke up next to not just a and
undesirable but an entire team of them
that didn't exist in high school I would
have taken any port in a storm
how how how how much regret do you have
for eating that enormous piece I think
it was the the was it the ghost pepper
or the Reaper I just thought it was the
hottest one and the answer to either one
is no regrets no regrets it's a sponsor
and people are supposed to buy this
stuff cuz you were you were relatively
ok alright ok at the time you don't want
any oh that's right you're vegetarian
aren't you mostly mostly alright alright
so um I mean my wife's dad's a hunter
heats shoot some moose I eat them that's
good he doesn't make jerky though you
did the ghost pepper yeah why not is
that the hot the hardest one is that the
Reaper mmm the second hottest one mmm
it's got quite a kick though the problem
though was not eating it the problem was
that enormous piece that you made at one
time because I get a text message from
this guy hours later I think you might
even the next morning actually that
savage jerky though yeah it was actually
the way it's sad in my stomach I felt
pretty bad until I put a bunch of food
in there after leaving so savage jerky
its savage it's spicy it's like
real-deal
like you were like yeah I can handle
spicy was that spicy I was spicy it was
a spicy jerky I've ever had
it's made with the great ingredients
without nitrates or preservatives the
goal was to create a snack that was full
of flavor full of flavor it's spicy
flavor mm-hmm you can't taste it when
it's that spicy but okay one of these
days I rest assured the other flavors
are tasty a lot of them are really too
see the the maple-bacon is really good
um the man the what's the green one
whatever the green one is I highly
recommend the green one but anyway
they've got rock we what the green one
no not the green jerky I'm gonna got 13
different flavors though go check them
out and also they make barbecue sauce
hot sauce and a spice rub so they're
Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of
the hottest peppers in the world the the
James the bell pepper know that the
Carolina Reaper pepper so use all four
coat LTT and get 10% off over at Savage
jerky dot-com now let's go back to our
straw poll I am really interested to see
these results I'm betting on don't fix
it fix it Wow sweet okay so you're with
them right yeah I think if they refresh
it they should just use the same
joystick mechanism they using like a
GameCube controller for example
interesting even though you know if
you're firing up some perfect dark or
whatever it might be a slightly
different experience I would hope I have
never like side by side a be test of
this but I would hope that a fresh 64
controller the feel of that joystick is
similar to like a normal PlayStation or
GameCube Xbox controllers joystick so do
you think that's pretty loose from the
beginning know when you got a new snap
you want it was like yes when you got
like get one for your birthday or
something like that but how they
degraded so poorly over time it was
sometimes unplayable and if your player
for you always got that one and then you
have to buy another one in like if they
could just avoid that whole thing again
that'd be great James tell me something
tell me about your childhood mmm
were you player four do you look if you
don't want to talk about it buddy it's
okay but what were you player four
sometimes I had two friends who are
exceptionally good gamers and I got
slate every single time at Smash Bros
and gold night but I was good at perfect
dark okay so that that's a big load of
bullcrap Oh someone mix them up again
was I not actually mmm that's a really
tasty one actually now I don't even know
what I'm eating though
dang it they're all good so my friend
you know what let me use his name
because he's a game um and he deserves
it so my friend tyson in high school
food guy would have me over to his house
guy had a Playstation one I kind of a
season two we are right that's the
camping battlestations house mm-hmm
all right so guys got a Playstation one
got a PlayStation 2 I was living with my
mom we didn't own a game console at all
computer yes game console no ROM don't
you have like six brothers and sisters
yeah and you shared one PC yes I was the
nerd though like no one else really
wanted to use it that much until my
until my little sister discovered habbo
hotel you guys wouldn't like this I love
to have a hotel for a time terrible
anyway so I thought so I go over to his
house all the time
he's got Playstations I got no console
at all this guy he sits and plays Tekken
like all the time and like what was that
what was that car game that twisted
metal twist yeah Tekken okay so he plays
these games all the time I show up I'm
clearly already at a disadvantage
because I barely play them I only play
when I'm over at his house and like with
him so he clearly has my experiences X
he clearly has X plus y yeah he was big
nerd so I'm pretty sure you this Y is
quite large and he gives me not just
a worn-out controller he gives me this
like total bitch mode like third-party
controller like a Mad Catz or some with
an ant no not even a Mad Catz
no not even dollar store like the brand
broke dick okay not only that but it has
the analog stick broken off so the
analog sticks is a stump and the entire
thing is like the least certain like
it's like this wide and my hands like
even now my hands can fit on it you're
talking about ps1 where analog was
optional the default control didn't have
sticks I don't remember yeah must be
twisted metal must be ps2 then well the
point is he makes me use this bitch
controller because he doesn't want to
invest in another PlayStation controller
we try again he's a child
he should give me the good one and he
was not a child he was like 13 did he
have a paper route job no but he should
give me the good controller all right
but he can't invest investing when your
kid is like my birthday is here he
should still give me the better
controller that's I'm a guest in his
house and I suck at the game he should
play with the crappy contracts an adult
perspective as a kid you're basically a
little animal well and it's way of the
road but yeah get nerfed do you think
when you played a Bond Goldeneye when
you choose your characters obviously you
have an advantage if you're odd job
because he's really small and people
have to crouch to hit him or aim down
and a me down sucked because they don't
had one joystick do you think other than
odd job that the characters that you
chose and gold and I were actually
balanced or that bond had just a light
edge bond had a one more health bar it
was a little faster do you think bond
was different only one of my friends had
Goldeneye getting better friends man
yeah I know one of my friends had
Goldeneye and I didn't go over to his
house very much and as you know I didn't
own any consoles during that time
strawpoll so well no I actually am straw
pulling a far more important question
should the guest get the better
controller this is far more important on
if you want to win if you're the host no
of course you're gonna
win anyway you plate looking like I went
through this with Luke when mario kart
launched for the Wii U and we played it
together like once like pretty early on
I think and then the guys like playing
it constantly and he goes and he pulls
this whole telling himself that he's
unlocking all the characters and
everyone should be grateful but then you
can't play with him because he's one of
those hopeless people that plays like
party games by themselves so they can
kick everybody's butt at the party
that's not fun that's not a party the
best party gaming experience the best
party gaming experience has come when
nobody is good at the game which yeah
everybody's playing some crap game that
nobody ever heard I once won a mario
party mario party competition at a real
party and it was the mario party game
where you have to shake the pop did you
get invited to real this one's much you
got to shake the wheat most like this
funny cuz of a real party that's sad it
was a real party because it was hosted
by girls it was a real party it was real
this is why it was real it was in
college 1 it was in residence no parents
it was hosted by women and because at
the end of the tournament it was me
against a girl and I won the whole time
throughout the tournament I was using my
right hand I'm left-handed
took her out special weapon so you
princess bride Edurne boom if she if she
beat all the guys at that do you not get
the reference I've seen the movie no no
no this is how you feel when I do all
the references no you guys every Friday
you can't have seen The Princess Bride
The Princess Bride is a fundamental
cornerstone of our culture you okay you
three or four years older than me I
don't remember yeah when you get old
does your memory starts to that's their
different
all right you know what why don't we
just do a tech topic cuz I've had enough
of your bull crap can we do Amazon they
surprised that rooms we six new hardware
products out of nowhere who cares it's
just more like digital assistance
because you're in Canada and you can't
use them know you care right we should
so are you we should have someone in the
states who just has this stuff and just
just reviews Amazon correspondent all
right so the original article here is
from TechCrunch so there's there's more
echo hardware there's more echo Hardware
echo hardware that go hard the new echo
is a refresh of the original it's
smaller it's a hundred dollars has got a
cloth covered body it has a dedicated
woofer and tweeter this is a key aside
from the products that they introduced
it's so interesting in the in their
business model in the way that Amazon
works which is completely different to
how any other hardware manufacturer
works there's not six Google homes there
will be another one next week but you
know you know what I mean they just
launched six there's like one with the
screen one without a screen there's big
one at all and there's there's so many
and they're all dirt cheap why do they
do that how do they do that
why doesn't anyone else do that I know
why they do that go ahead let me tell
you it's because Amazon has so many
different parts to their business all
these parts are interconnected and
actually create a positive feedback loop
with each other so they can sell these
hardware products dirt cheap because the
point isn't to make all the revenue from
selling these hardware products their
point is to get people using Amazon echo
to order things on prime to spend more
money in their core business which is
selling stuff on amazon.com I'm not
actually convinced that their core
business is selling stuff on amazon.com
are they still losing money on that like
with Prime I only have to order like two
things here in Canada
- just like req Amazon on Prime but
you're an outlier because Amazon's data
shows that Prime customers on average
spent $1200 a year $1200 a year yeah but
that doesn't change that that Prime
customer could be like they could be
losing a ton of money on that Prime
membership on just $1200
orders like you order a couple computer
cases and they're like they're done like
they're done for what they're charging
for Prime I mean I think honestly I
think their core business just from the
shipping date I'm getting free shipping
AWS is a huge part of the MS I think
it's like a third of it now and they
have all the market share in that space
they're not just AWS but just knowing
what people are buying understanding the
consumer because right now like Amazon
is like it's like the Silicon Valley
startup which they are of course but
like the Silicon Valley startup like on
steroids
well they're the one that made it
through the dot-com bubble yeah where
they just they just never actually exit
startup mode yeah they just keep making
their business like worth more and more
and more and it doesn't actually matter
how much money they make because it's
sort of irrelevant and then once they've
just crowded out everybody else then
they just crank all the prices and
they're like yep come at me will it mine
I mean right now they're still in
start-up mode so they go and acquire
Whole Foods and I slash all the prices
but it benefits consumers for now for
now yeah until like when Amazon merges
with Costco then we're all done for it
mmm that'll be the and that'll actually
be the end the end of time the end times
whatever it's called the dark times is
something the reckoning so there's a new
echo there's an echo Plus which is the
same as the original but now as a smart
home hub its beefed up how many people
have smart home crap well that's the
thing
so what Amazon does is they they put a
little fishing line out and that was the
echo they see how well it does and then
if it makes money or there's interests
or a markets developing they just hammer
it and that's what they're doing now
with these race to the bottom priced the
deluge of products there's six of them
they're beating Apple and Google to the
punch here I think at the Google event
which we're gonna cover next Wednesday
morning I think Google is planning on we
know they're announcing a small Google
home but there's speculation that they
are also going to release one with a
screen on it that can make video calls
and
watch Netflix which is a direct response
to the echo show so this is a hardware
tech space other than ebooks I guess re
readers where Amazon actually has a lead
over that the biggest players so they're
trying to grab market share it's a land
grab yeah so pricing wise everything
from 99 to 130 for the echo spot which
is kind of like a crossover between the
dot and the show smart alarm clock that
can make video calls I mean basically
yeah so the idea is they want these
things all over your house echo button
is 20 bucks a pair hockey-puck sized
prepares with the echo necks like an
inner place for like trivia games yes so
you can interact with it it's ten bucks
I just I really do think I'm losing
touch like I'm getting old fashioned
check it out the echo spot though or
which one of these there's one that has
a speaker on it that's oh it's that's
the fired TV now I can't believe that
being willing to take your phone out of
your pocket to look something up is
old-fashioned now don't you want to be
able to use it when you're cooking
you're hands are wet my phone's
waterproof get on my level but you can't
swipe it's called an apron apron I can
picture you in or a tea towel who cares
oh it's so annoying cuz bixby as you'll
see in our upcoming video you can
control the actual interface like
Bixby's swipe left how sweet is that
just have your recipe up there your
chops off bixby scroll down you can see
the next part of the recipe awesome hey
Siri Oh for crying out loud this this is
why it this is this is the problem with
all this stuff none of it works the way
you expect okay here's something you
like a little you'd like you have an
opinion on this right fire to apologize
to me I don't need friends who apologize
they got a new fire t 4k it's $70 that's
$100 less than the Apple TV 4k I'll get
rekt Apple $100 less
it's the same price as a chromecast 4k
okay alright I just I have such a hard
time caring about that I'm speaking of
things I have a hard time caring about
um NumLock 21 posted this on the forum
the original article is from guru 3d you
don't care about this is this is exactly
the kind of thing that gets your blood
rushing actually no what am I supposed
to do would 20 gigabit USB stuff fast
yeah like what do stuff fast know what
what stuff am i doing taking stuff off
of external stuff putting out on their
stuff why would I be doing that you're a
camera person I have an ass you're a
camera person
okay what am i okay okay okay okay
in the future so can we just introduce
this this is pretty cool so basically
it's an update to the USB 3 spec that
will allow what would be a five gigabit
line to carry 10 gigabit per second and
what would be 10 to carry up to 20 so
that is a doubling of the bandwidth this
will be done by adding two-lane
operation over existing USB C cables so
provided the cables have been certified
for 10 gigabit per second super speed
USB then this will work however both the
host and the client need to be
compatible with the new standard so
theoretically 20 gigabit per second
we're talking like 2,500 megabytes per
second so let's say hypothetically that
some you know camera manufacturer that
thinks they're just way too good to
charge reasonable prices for their gear
where to actually release recording
media that is actually faster than just
an off-the-shelf M SATA SSD
let's say that they were recording to
nvme SSDs if I had a reader that could
read at you know 220 gigabit then I
guess if I also had a 20 gigabit you
know network then I could copy over to
that if I had a Thunderbolt
what am I doing with this why do you
care so much about thunderbolt but you
don't care about this
well Thunderbolt school because it's
Daisy chainable it carries DisplayPort
which okay you see DisplayPort as well
but it can okay but it can carry
DisplayPort and data at the same time
it's a PCI Express connection we are you
saying that USB see you can't do data
and DisplayPort at the same time not
that I'm aware of
okay um okay the other the other thing
about Thunderbolt is that because it is
essentially PCI Express oh for a wire
without like janky adapters you can
actually run basically internal cards so
if you want to have a USB graphics card
for example you need something like
craptastic you know USB 3d accelerator
with the freaking 2d crap on it it's
complicated they're over $100 if you
wanted a Thunderbolt graphics card you
could just use a real graphics card and
you don't have to go and spend $600 on a
razor core $500 or whatever it is you
can get something like that beast thing
from banggood we got one we never got it
working but that's a whole other issue
the point is that there's the potential
for it
daisy chainable PCI Express regardless
of the actual rated speeds of either of
them is cooler that's cooler but let's
back this up a bit obviously you can't
be mad that this is getting faster
no and that it uses the same cord I just
jump some of the crowd I'll have a
single thing that benefits from 10
Gigabit USB let alone 20 we we all want
the technology to move for it but here
here's a couple questions first question
when are we can expect these things to
any devices like this to actually hit
the market
I don't probably you don't even see Jen
- really yet I think
barely does a z2 70 chipset I think I
think z2 70 finally got USB 3.1 gen2 No
I don't think it has it I think and
these chips have sad to have 399 dos
yeah I think that's um that's the
next-gen until feature so we're probably
like maybe the leapfrog it not to three
years away but we'll see second question
I could be wrong as a clarification you
said when you introduced this topic that
it will double the speed of either your
five gigabit cable or your ten gigabit
cable so it means you'll be able I
thought it was only for only the ten
gigabit cables could do it so no it's
basically they're just they're they're
doubling up on what could be carried by
the existing cables so right now you can
and I mean the cable certifications are
like and you know you can get a five
gigabit cable and the chances of it
doing ten gigabit are probably pretty
good if it was a good cable in the first
place so I don't stress too much about
that stuff how would this what else we
got iPhone eight swollen battery have
you seen this
I have Hardware zone.com the original a
poster on the forum was vegetable stew
like great name reports of swollen
batteries inside the new iPhone surface
online like I know this isn't gonna
matter or make a dent in anything either
their perception or their sales but I
still just it's a little win I like when
this happens to Apple why I don't know
someone bought an expensive thing and it
broke yeah well they're gonna be fine
they're gonna get another one that's it
is a drag you might take a couple weeks
for them but I think it's just you know
what it is
Wow it's not too anti fanboy it's just
that some people are so hardcore fat
like I try not to find boy anything try
to be scientific about things when
people found boy really hard as many
Apple people do it's just nice to have
something to point to be like it they're
not perfect okay they're not the iPhones
aren't manna from heaven based correct
sometimes okay so this happened in
Taiwan and Japan after three days using
the original charger apparently one of
them's body and screen split from the
bloat I mean a half centimeter gap yeah
that's how much it swelled Wow
a lot there are unconfirmed reports
coming in that the iPhone 8 plus uses
the same battery manufacturer ampere X
Technologies Limited as the Samsung
Galaxy Note 7 we're in baby burn herp a
derp now if that's true then that looks
pretty bad on Apple and Samsung
well no not Sam's because I don't think
I mean Samsung has sort of fixed their
crap I don't think I've seen any reports
of notates having any issues razer
confirms development of a gamer oriented
mobile device the company confirmed
earlier this year a 15 million dollar
acquisition of all shares of mobile
start up next bit who had previously
produced the next bit robin smartphone
and they canceled it when they bought
them mm-hmm okay founded in Singapore
with Labadee Blood cetera wow they
really did not much to say about it so I
want to speculate though shirts what
does it mean to make a gamers phone
other than black with green accents
definitely that's a given probably
really boxy and lots of fuck angles on
it but aside from that high refresh rate
screen you have to see a high refresh
rate screen but again that's a bare
minimum given that razor still doesn't
have a high refresh rate screen on the
latest blade I wouldn't get my hopes up
if an iPad pro exists already that
review is still coming by the way if an
iPad pro exists for a year before this
gamer phone comes out and one of the
things gamers care about is high refresh
rate screens if that already exists and
then this phone comes something doesn't
have that lights out I don't think a lot
of gamers know that they care about high
refresh rate screens to be perfectly
honest like our audience I think is more
educated when it comes to that gamers
now console gamers like I think I think
they think that 60 Hertz is pretty good
well if you're if everyone has the same
hardware it's like having a console the
phone will be basically like a
consequence everyone's using the same
hardware so they could lock the fridge
right I just mean like nobody is
necessarily demanding this right or are
they because as for another news item in
here
the head of Playstation was like yeah
we're not doing mobile gaming anymore
yeah I know
because smartphones so they're still
selling the Vita within what is it Japan
I think is that it and it was like Japan
and somewhere but yes Sony is basically
like yeah nobody wants handhelds anymore
we have not seen that as being a huge
market opportunity outside of Japan and
Asia you might say what about the switch
but that's like a hybrid it's kind of
like an exception I think they made
market share for themselves mm-hmm
because well yeah because they made
market share for mobile devices because
it replaced their TV console hmm so
exactly yeah yeah no choice but to buy a
mobile gaming console so if you have a
phone already for gaming I kind of think
that makes sense to have a gaming phone
yeah but what is it okay so high refresh
rate what else makes it gaming maybe
they'll just sacrifice like you won't
care so much about camera they'll give
you more room to have a bigger beef your
components but the camera doesn't take
up almost any room like it's all
processing driven these days anyway and
I would make the argument that if you're
gonna try and sell me a gaming phone if
anything it should have a better camera
it should have a great front-facing
camera so I can really streaming three
mobile games maybe it'll only have a
front-facing camera oh lordy maybe it'll
have like a joystick people are like
battery life okay if Razer came out and
they were like yep it's a flagship class
phone it has like a six thousand
milliamp hour battery I'd be like okay
sure because now you can actually go and
play your clash of the clans for like
five eight hours uninterrupted on a
device well it'll probably band I'm
kidding I know it's clash of clans
there's a problem I would expect it to
be like double thick because under this
like gaming moniker you can get away
with certain things that people don't
normally allow in a normal phone it
might be fat and have a huge battery
yet see there it is there it is they're
like clash of the clans law so
apparently it's dead - I don't know
that's the joke from grab of cash oh man
I always know I can set these guys off
with my outdated and like incorrect
gaming references anyway what about this
this angle here okay what do you got the
creation of an original mobile device
also opens up the potential for razer to
invest in mobile esports a growing space
those rays are actually like trying to
build products that people want to buy
and make money or they just trying to
like pull a Silicon Valley and make
their business worth a lot so that they
can get acquired mm-hmm don't they what
what are they doing with the like that
currency don't remember but they're like
dabbling we're doubling like everything
like they did an Android console for the
living room like what happened to that
thing no idea maybe they're just trying
to have like a fully engineering
ecosystem I remember they were really
excited about their competitor for like
Nvidia games dream and steam in-home
streaming they showed it to me back at
CES like no no two years ago or
something like that I was like yeah this
isn't very good they're like oh yeah but
it'll be like way better and then I
don't think I've heard about it since
Elon Musk wants to use his rockets just
to fly around Earth like go from here to
London in 30 minutes 30 minutes same
price as an economy airline ticket price
somehow no wonder he bailed on the
Hyperloop because that's like way better
not for the environment no but it's
faster hell yeah it's faster it'll show
you into space like low-earth orbit and
then you'll just go look at 18,000 miles
an hour I think it is like an order of
magnitude faster than anything humanity
has ever done and they're building this
in this next six to nine months they're
starting it
well he's crazy and it's after six and
tgi-friday baby one comment though the
question everybody's mine if you are
gonna fly to your business trip in
Shanghai on this thing
what kind of G's are you pulling on the
launch pad are you like me I looked it
up turns out the human body Ken was down
nine G's mm-hmm and that Gravitron game
at the yeah like play later yeah we're
it stick C to the wall I mean like your
phone goes flying that's like two and a
half to three G's and Wow
yeah so that's only a third of what your
body can take I've been fighter jet but
there's that other Gravitron there's the
it's not called the Gravitron it's
called legs and are something the one
that flips up on the side oh yeah so on
that one it spins about as fast as the
Gravitron I think because it has to keep
you stuck to the seat when you're upside
down but then when you're down at the
bottom like it's it's stronger you're
like shot in your like the slingshot
into them yeah yeah yeah regardless
anyway it's apparently a typical rocket
launch is like three G's so similar to
the Gravitron oh that's not too bad yeah
Wow you could totally do that
yeah you do that every day maybe I'll
just commute from my house in a rocket
boom boom indeed you would literally
boom you would go to every conference
you go to Computex you go to the
Microsoft event to see the new surface
whatever oh yeah an hour for the day so
yeah see you tonight
especially if it's that cheap I don't
know how he's gonna make it that cheap I
don't think he's gonna make it that
cheap yeah well alright well thanks for
tuning in you guys see you next week
same bat-time same bat-channel
bye bye thanks for stopping by you know
that mean like the first mean I thought
you're old
