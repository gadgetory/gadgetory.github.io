actually a lead-in into something more
interesting okay so I have a copy of
Windows 7 Professional this is a retail
copy it is an upgrade designed for
Windows Vista to be upgraded but it says
right on the side all the ditions of
Windows XP and Windows Vista qualify you
to upgrade you must accept the enclosed
license terms it's got some system
requirements all that good stuff so
let's get this thing open and the reason
I'm opening this is because I want to
test if you can install an upgraded copy
of Windows 7 without actually having
another operating system already
installed and no one seems to know yet
whether you have to actually install
Windows Vista or whether you just need
to put in your product key when you're
installing Windows 7 so you slide the
retail box out of the little slip here
which also shows you all the differences
between the different editions of
Windows 7 so home premium professional
ultimate with professional you get run
many windows XP ok you get Windows XP
Mode you get support for a domain and
you can recover your data easily with
automatic backup to your home or
business network then with ultimate you
get BitLocker encryption and you also
get your choice of 35 languages ok there
we go
so then we have a little seal on the top
which is made in Puerto Rico okay we've
got our Windows 7 logo there Microsoft
yeah ok it's probably fairly
bog-standard I would say so let's rip
that baby open all right here you go if
you are upgrading from Windows XP run
the windows upgrade advisor save your
files to an external hard drive you will
need to manually reinstall your programs
and you want to select custom advanced
this to me indicates that there's a
pretty good chance that we can just
install the upgrade fresh because
they're telling you if you are
installing for Windows XP you will need
to completely reformat your computer ok
so that's a that's a that's a good
indicator
all right then welcome to your pc
simplified this is the little brochure
about Windows 7 some of the key new
features all that good stuff
there's your product key and
then there are two windows seven disks
one with 32-bit software and the other
with 64-bit software thank you for
checking out my video blog on my Windows
7 Professional upgrade unboxing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
