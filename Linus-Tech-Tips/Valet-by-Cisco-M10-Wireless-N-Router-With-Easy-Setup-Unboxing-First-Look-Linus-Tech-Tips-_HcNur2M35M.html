the Cisco Valley wireless router so you
can see that this was actually sitting
on my floor for a couple days and like
cat chewed the corner of it but your box
won't look like that alright so from the
worldwide leader in wireless networking
Cisco we have what is apparently a home
Wireless made easy style products over
here you can see there's also an easy
set up key for worryfree setup and i've
unbox this one before and i'm actually
going to do some testing with this guy
well with both of them together to
determine exactly how easy it is to use
the cisco val a family of products
so the idea i suppose with vet lay being
the name is that it is all taken care of
for you and you don't really have to do
much setup so they've got award-winning
24/7 customer support as well as okay so
we've got speed and range of wireless n
we can link computers games and devices
to the Internet I'm going to turn this
around so you can sit we can manage
parental controls with these and give
internet access to guests cool stuff so
let's open it up and have a look at what
is inside the oh the side side of the
box is actually open I could have just
taken it out that way okay welcome to
the new home wireless experience with a
cat bite in it okay here we have oh okay
no that's oh oh the thing on the outside
of the box was not the wireless adapter
that I had already set up this is
interesting
plug in to your computer and click
connect to your cisco cisco valet to get
started really that's kind of neat so I
get it it's a valet key haha oh that's
clever okay hold on I'm just going to
put this here so I don't lose the
sticker and then I'm going to show you
guys the valet key so this is just a USB
and it is an easy set up key so we'll
have to definitely try that and this is
just a box and then
is okay so this here is the Cisco valet
router oh it's blue look at that huh
from wow I'm getting like tricked all
over the place I must be tired I saw
this and it looked like this was the
router with like a blue like halo around
it but no the router is actually white
and baby blue so we've got indicator
LEDs on the front here for the Ethernet
computers that are connected we've got a
connection button here we've got
Wireless we've got Internet and then
power indicator LEDs on these oh okay
neat so here's your ventilation right
here so air is going to just passively
from convection be drawn by the heat
rising up through these vent holes
it'll be drawn in through the bottom and
that is what is going to keep your cisco
valet running cool enough so here at the
back we can put plug in easy setup key
to get started okay so we're going to
pull this off and that is where we will
discover all of the business and parts
of this router so here's our Ethernet
our Internet port here are four Ethernet
ports here is a reset button and there
is the power of Jack so here is the
documentation or it really this doesn't
explain anything this just says what you
can do with a wireless router so that's
good and then here we find the power
plug as well as a an Ethernet cable so
really this this product is going to
come down to how easy is it to set up
and I don't have the answer to that yet
but hopefully I'll have a follow up
video for you guys shortly showing you
just how easy it is to set up the valet
is this something that you can recommend
to your grandma who wants a wireless
network to buy or is it something that
you're actually going to have to go and
set up for her stay tuned to my video
blog don't forget to subscribe and you
will find out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
