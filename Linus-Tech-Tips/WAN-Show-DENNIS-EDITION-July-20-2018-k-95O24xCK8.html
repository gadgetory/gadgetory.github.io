why I'm late today but it's under
embargo and I can't but it's really cool
oh it's like well no but there's always
a different reason and today the reason
is actually really cool we what's that
dude guy kicked off hardcore all right
so we've got a great show for you guys
today
dennis is going to be sharing with us
his experience of doing his very first
episode of tech linked that I coin
someone can someone zoom us in a little
bit more we have we're like we're like
swimming in the frame here if you don't
mind I'll be great thank you yeah I like
to get close and intimate see Dennis is
never dennis has never been on when I
hover so have you higher show are you
the entire show no no I never action I'm
also where the devil are my other
adapters Jake all right so Dennis hosted
his very first episode of teklynx
today they request and it was pretty
cringy from what I saw he was not don't
don't bump the table cuz the mics not
fit because it was pretty cringy from
what I saw but maybe I missed some parts
of it that were going smoothly that
maybe maybe we're great so can you go
ahead and let me know how that was for
you so Brendan was shooting it it was
fine lines it was okay so hold on
Brandon don't go away let Dennis finish
how did you go Dennis in the beginning
was kind of hard to read some some words
some words are hard oh so yeah Riley has
to change the world like what's the word
I couldn't pronounce I don't remember
and he just changed something very
simple like just say great okay I just
used that word or like better something
like that he just used that somewhere he
uses too hard for me right and I think
it's good you should watch the beat is
coming out very soon okay out of 10
Brendan oh I think it's better than okay
he's bad you
better than my first time on camera so
66.5 okay so today's episode of tech
linked don't miss it six and a half out
of ten quality person fortunately we
have at least fixed the the stream
quality of the wine show some of you are
speculating that we might have upgraded
to a different camera no all we did was
change the the video settings to the
same as we used on the LG ultra wide
streamed PC build yesterday and Luke so
bippity Boppity fixed so Brandon says
we've also fixed some of the lighting as
well so so the reality of it is that the
lights in question are like $60
softboxes are off being debate brandon
these are nothing fancy right i don't
think nothing fancy and the camera is it
identical the capture hardware is
identical we've just been doing it that
wrong for that long so on that note
let's get this when show epicfail party
started
I don't expect you to
nobody can hear you right now right and
they can they can yo my god
all right so we have got a great show
for you guys today we got a bunch of
cool topics Apple's new MacBook Pro
throttles so bad so bad that we had to
do a dedicated livestream today to show
how we could get it to throttle from
being inside the packaging to thermal
throttled in less than 20 minutes and we
probably could have done it a lot faster
if I had any idea what the heck I was
doing with a macbook and if it was
already unboxed we could we could have
done it in like one minute so a number
of different publications have talked
about this so we'll talk about our
results as well as others in other news
the new MacBook Pro keyboard does
apparently have crumb protection
what's crumb protection from protection
we will go through that in more detail
once we get to that news topic this is
the part where we tease them you know
it's like it's like what the news
segment that's like make sure you watch
the news at 11:00 you know like oh wow
coffee could give you aids in your mouth
more at 11:00 I mean like no I need to
know now hook it's a hook yeah it's the
hook see dennis has learned so much
about making videos since since he got
here like when I first met him he was
like yeah I'm gonna make a video about
an interview and I'm gonna have a
picture of Hitler in the background why
do you mention this every time and I
have explained this every time just
forget about that's not true it is true
it's 100% true when I interviewed Dennis
on skype he had a poster of Hitler on
the wall behind him see now he's trying
to he's trying to run away from the
truth but it was the truth okay it does
require a little bit more context once
you know what we're gonna talk about
that later too
the rise in three-hundredths their 3,000
series may have more than eight cores
this is a rumor over at tech power up &amp;amp;
masaya apparently has dropped some hints
and finally yet another cpu rumor intel
chips the new ones coming may finally on
the consumer side have soldered IHS is
maybe intel has finally bowed to the
pressures it would it be bowed or bowed
I look who I'm asking forget it probably
okay alright so why don't we jump into
our first topic here Dennis is Hitler
poster
oh that okay why did you have a poster
of Hitler on the wall behind you so when
I interviewed you for a job I did not I
didn't remember it I have that own on my
wall and that is as a reference about
something that the political issue that
we had back then in Taiwan didn't
actually mean about Hilary said if you
have some Chinese catch on that but you
just didn't understand hmm so I
misunderstood your Hitler poster it's
not I'm twits check this did nothing
wrong yeah that I know I'm not saying
Dennis did nothing wrong but and let's
get let's get those let's get that
chopped out so we can take that out of
context right I'm not saying Dennis did
nothing wrong it's just that Dennis had
a poster of Hitler on the wall behind
him during a job interview that was a
mistake by the poster didn't mean it was
it was like being against this guy it's
like no no right but you have a symbol I
know but it didn't have a Simba it has
Chinese but it has Chinese characters
that mean now I wish I have a picture of
it but I don't have a I would it's gone
sorry gone I think my mom took we should
totally do a new shirt Oh like a dentist
did nothing wrong shirt with you we
could just get some sharpie and give you
a little muscle actually you know what
we're not gonna do that
as a general as a general rule Linus
tech tips tries to stay pretty you know
pretty PG friendly you know maybe not
even yeah oh come on how much time have
you spent on YouTube people are like I
would buy a t-shirt no no no no no no no
but have they seen that might the news
shirt we saw it Oh TX ah
wait is that listed online yet
so so it's been said it's only sale
we only saw them ot eggs seriously so we
don't even have it don't online do you
have one here so I go grab it
you should go grab it we could totally
do a variant of like the Dennis shirt oh
man yeah that would be awesome this
thing is like it's a it's a it's a it's
a moving meme like once you put it on
it's a wearable it's a completely
wearable meme I actually had no I
honestly I don't know about a lot of the
shirt designs that they work on these
days until they show up on the store or
like add a meet-up apparently so there's
there's a couple things in the store
here that I'm just gonna I'm gonna pop
up here I actually haven't tested my my
screen cap to see if it's working yet oh
it is cool so this one for example the
troll line is shirt the name is real
they were actually trolling me when they
created it this one someone showed up at
the meetup wearing this this was an a
prime initiative absolutely horrible
it is every bit as awful in person as it
looks online and the way that it's
printed is actually really nice like it
looks crisp and then even like
everything under the armpits the whole
thing is printed with horrible thumbnail
faces and then of course they created
this mess
go ahead yeah stand up oh my god this
was supposed for a biro wheat we did and
I don't know why they took it down
Ida took it out from the I think s AIDS
review or something really they took
that out of the video it's very
distasteful I don't I don't agree with
you I think it's fine like so every time
someone brought me one of these at the
show I was going out of my way I know I
saw so any you something it you like
drawn my oh my I in mustache yeah so I
was defacing all of the Dennis shirts
whenever a head time like if there were
like 30 people in front of you see
there's a lot of time but oh yes there
was
whoa was there one where I like didn't I
color in you're an entire eye patch on
your yes that's no that one took so long
but I was like you know what this is
100% worth it yeah so this shirts not
available online yet Loie no not yet
oh okay are we gonna put it online I
don't know maybe maybe not
maybe I don't know I mean honestly I
think it's kind of fun to have like
exclusive merch that's only available at
something like a meet-up I don't think
that's necessarily a bad thing actually
we should have we even when was LTX last
Sunday I mean times a blur for me it
hasn't we haven't done a way and show
since IX that started how was it what
did you think oh it was crazy I think I
think we have more people this year
right uh Oh quite a few more we had over
1,100 people some just almost 1200
people show up this is a lot okay so
most of the people most people I met
they are not from Canada like mostly
mostly from the state Australia UK
they're from everywhere okay there's I
have a confession
yeah hold that thought that stresses me
out a lot so the night before I was
actually having like a panic attack a
little bit and honestly like everything
was fine I actually apologized to Colton
and staff afterward for freaking out but
it got to the point where I actually
asked them okay how much are we in this
for and they gave me a total number it
was more than ten thousand but less than
a hundred and so I was like and my
initiative et8 response was and I felt
so bad for saying this I was like okay
then so worst case scenario were out
however many thousands of dollars it was
and we just refund everyone and they
were like what did you just say because
basically I was so worried about a few
things that I was like I was i I thought
I thought we were gonna be tannic on to
point O and and this was just me
freaking out because and then and then
like I it didn't even make me feel
better
for longer than like two seconds because
what I realized based on how huge the
international
audience was the last time that a lot of
people were gonna be in this for
hundreds or maybe even over a thousand
dollars to come attend so that was
actually where the idea came from to
allow decoration of my car yeah that's
right beef this guy this guy right here
I ruined your car actually that was for
me last on the way like we drove back
from LAX midnight at midnight and we
trying to figure out more things to do
yeah and I thought I didn't know they
would do that much though I thought just
like outside and they so everything in
the in your car so initially we were
thinking spray bombs and that would have
been way worse that would have been a
disaster what I think we should have
done was just Sharpie markers no I think
what you should have done is just lock
your doors and oh no I was okay with the
morning yeah well so my seat belt
doesn't work right now oh oh Michael
yeah it was working before but this
driver
yeah the driver's side doesn't work it's
like jammed or something I actually you
understand your drive yeah so so and so
so anyway I was just having this panic
attack because I was freaking out anyway
I apologize to them later because
honestly the event was a lot of fun and
I let you finish your thought now I'm
sorry Dennis
I don't okay so there are a lot of
people fly flying from everywhere hands
and there's even like someone might just
arrived from from China and bring his
luggage and his mom to the event like 2
o'clock yeah yeah I have to help them to
like store the luggage so even thing
like we might need a locker for them
next year
wow that's crazy like 1012 hours flight
anyway yes no we do not plan to offer
refunds because we consider the event a
success now it was fun we actually got a
ton of really positive user feedback
in fact mark has tweeted about how he
really was wasn't happy with average
article that was about another youtuber
convention that was poorly organized in
a disaster and he kind of goes
Oh where's the positive headline for LTX
I've heard nothing but positive things
and that's cool because a lot of the
time people will say something positive
to your face like if I walk up to
someone I'm like hey how are you
enjoying LTX it's like when the waiter
comes to your table like if your food
sucks do you ever say yeah this food is
trash I'm not getting a tip today like
some I suck depends what if it's just
like on the low side of mediocre if they
come along how how's everything goes
with your meal so it's okay yeah okay so
there that's not that's not useful so so
if I so if I walk up to someone I'm like
hey how's the house the house LTX and
people like oh yeah it's good I have no
way if they're just like shy and they
think it's good or if they're like kind
of unhappy and they're like oh yeah
that's good because I don't know I'm
meeting all these people for the first
time I can't really I can't really read
them so so it's way more important to us
to hear what other people say now I
actually haven't done it yet I need to
set aside an hour for myself and Jay
made a video Barna Cleese made a video
and Steve from gamers Nexus oh yeah he
did a really unusual video did you check
it I haven't seen any of so I only
skimmed a little bit of it so far so I
haven't taken away all of my thoughts
from it yet but Steve use the
opportunity of coming up here for LTX to
enjoy my city my hometown he went up to
the to the bike trails up on Whistler
and he did some downhill biking I saw
that and recorded his thoughts on LTX
while just like cruising down the trails
I thought that was really cool that's a
really unusual thing for him to do and
he even said he apologizes for making
the video right in the description yeah
because he just wasn't sure people were
gonna like it um I saw that here let's
check this out reviewing Linus tech tips
is LTX while downhill biking at Whistler
here what's he say we'll be posting more
serious content from the event later
including an interview oh no I think he
took down the apology oh no there it is
no opponent was caught he pinned his own
comment
hey all obviously
normal content for us we've had non-stop
travel for a few months we hope you'll
excuse this one off different content
peace for now I thought it was I thought
it was really cool to see people come up
here experience something different and
engage with the community and do
something different not just make normal
convention content because we're not
trying to be clumpy tanks or sea yes
it's supposed to be it's supposed to
fill a gap and honestly this year even
though our attendance only went from
about 800 to about 1200 so it's like a
50% uptake which is a success yeah but
it's still not huge it's not like we're
packs all of a sudden I think the
difference in creator attendance is what
is the difference between LTX 2017 being
like a Linus tech tips fan meetup and
LTX 2018 being a more impactful industry
event the fact that you've got guys like
Jay and Steve and Lewis Rossman was
there for a little while and Barnacle is
showing up and having a good time Barna
Cleese emailed me after the fact and
said that he had a really hard time
making a vlog there yeah and the reason
was that he was spending so much of his
time interacting with fans and oh yeah
and all three Steve I haven't actually
talked to Luis yet but Steve Brawner
Cleese and and Jay all talked to me and
said they were surprised at how many
people there were fans of their channels
because they kind of came into it like
they came into it to support us like we
asked them really nicely to come they
weren't paid to attend or anything the
most the most we were able to offer was
like look LTX is not a super profitable
event and it's still not but we'd love
to pay for your hotel and your flight if
you if you can come up and be part of
this for us and not just for us for the
community and they decided to do it and
they came up and they were like yeah I
was surprised at how many people here
were here for me
and I was like is so cool so so that's
where LTX turns a corner and becomes not
just about us but also about
other people and other creators that can
be there there was one other one that I
was really hoping would be there but he
got pulled aside for for a separate
thing anyway all three of them have
expressed interest I'm not going to
commit anything on their behalf but all
three of them have expressed interest in
coming back they're coming back next
year which is super amazing and cool
because Vancouver has like nothing for
tech events we've got like SIGGRAPH
which I know very like animation
industry like computer design industry
like it's not it's not consumer yeah so
I'm excited I'm really looking forward
to next year already me too but then the
night before I'm probably gonna be like
yeah I tell everything will be fine
I know no people like make you so much
effort to this and I know you stress out
but maybe do your car again I buy a new
kind let's do that again
or you know what fire helicopter or
something I do I do have to say though I
I think an event really needs something
impactful something truly memorable
something really different LTX 2017 had
the first first ever thread ripper
running we had someone game on thread
Ripper for the first time there that was
really cool okay LTX 2018 had the car
yeah nobody who tagged that car is ever
gonna forget that yeah so even though my
car is destroyed 100% worth it I would
destroy my car for the community mind
you my car is only worth a couple
hundred dollars literally asked how much
when I went to buy my minivan that was a
trade in favor they offered like two or
three hundred dollars or something which
is basically what you can get from like
a recycler yeah and I was like I
wouldn't take it if you want to give it
for free really it Ron first lettuce
that's a standard card oh don't know
don't hate on standard and it is good
stuff
no the windshields like broken in
leaking and all that well it doesn't
leak anymore really did you fix it -
traced the the leak and no
yeah I think I think you're being a
hater
um Oh Cho Cho tak asks when can we
expect more creators on floatplane so
Luke's not here today as you guys may or
may not have noticed because he is
working on some floatplane stuff that's
super important we've got some payments
and reporting stuff that we've really
got to get sorted out before we can move
forward with some of the bigger plans
and that's why it actually means a lot
to us that Kyle and tech deals are over
there and kind of helping us ride out
these bugs now there are they are
getting paid they have people
subscribing to them and like things are
working but we're not ready to take on
like you know a huge creator like if
PewDiePie came to us tomorrow and was
like I want it on this floatplane thing
I would have to turn them away I'd have
to I'd have no choice just because we're
not ready yet the actual CDN
architecture is really good and that's
what we've spent a lot of our time on so
you don't get to see a lot of a lot of
the actual engineering that has gone on
to make it really strong and sustainable
we could scale it up actually very
quickly
but some of the other stuff reporting
the payments need some tweaking we
actually had an issue where some people
were some people are having payment
issues and their support tickets were
going to spam and they weren't ending up
in our in our management system and so I
had to send us some very apologetic
emails I felt really really bad about
that but some like where that's why we
don't want a million users overnight all
right so did we do like a news topic or
something I guess yeah yeah yeah I mean
it's pretty flexible like we don't have
to do matter we just talk about
something because I don't really know
any of this you want me to talk about
something you can do okay um
okay hold on um oh that flip phone wait
we got a flip phone no no okay that's
the same solved you're drunk you're
drunk Wow okay oh man
okay you know what we're gonna do this
topic anyway their channel article is
from TechCrunch let's go ahead and pop
line this is screen up here Disney
streaming services resurrecting the
Clone Wars and I was like oh yeah I'll
get Dennis to do this
everyone knows Star oh god Star Wars
again we just talked about in titling
Star Wars a culturally relevant
I don't watch Star Wars why because I
just don't like fakes that like
efficient I mean like you don't like
what efficient efficient fiction fiction
you don't like fiction I don't and I
don't like long movies well this is a TV
show but oh that was some of the Star
Wars movies are on the long side so what
movies do you like
I like actually mmm-hmm I like TV show I
like the office you like the office oh
the best
okay so Star Wars there's nothing ideal
no no no I can't be do you like
superhero movies i watch and then last
week yeah is it school okay I mean I'm
not like a big fan of heroes not a big
fan of heroes okay
so you don't like heroes okay that you
don't like anymore boy it was fun to
watch
okay so you like kind of an irreverent
sort of dark humor yes
okay okay Star Wars doesn't have a lot
of that yeah also I don't like low up
ring you don't like Lord of the Rings um
you know what I'm not even gonna give
you too hard at a time for that I mean
okay are you talking Lord of the Rings
trilogy or like The Hobbit I don't know
what you're talking about that movie
what are you're talking about the movies
the movies they're both movies okay I
don't know just how about ball I want to
know as I fall asleep I just you fell
asleep you know during which one you
don't even know Oh
okay we're there hobbits I'm just copy
that's not helpful there and all of them
I don't know would you do you like Monty
Python why is that you don't know Monty
Python you know what I'm gonna give you
some I'm gonna give you some some TV
homework okay okay because I want to
understand what makes you tick
are you familiar with life's too short I
think okay I think I've been trapped
with the office for too long because
I've been watching that show like for
almost two years I just re watching
you're watching and I'm just a digger to
it
really so I just can't get out of it
okay I need to try to okay I'm gonna get
you something new and you will like it
okay if you like the I like that kind of
humor okay do you like the American
office or the British off American
America I don't get British humor okay
oh oh you got okay no I don't okay
do you have a hard time understanding
the accent oh yes that too oh crap yeah
yeah I'm Mary Kay you only understand
American well then it's it's a wonder
that you manage to hang around with me
because I don't speak American well I
know what same thing I know what I mean
how does I do I can't tell with you is
this a shot at me for saying that
Taiwanese and Chinese I think with I
guess you kind of owed me one like in
fairness to you you owed me one yo I
can't tell seriously I cannot tell your
accent or someone from UK like me or
John I can care that okay that's very
you know cuz West Coast like Pacific
West Coast or specific Northwest
especially sorry I'm not Pacific West
Coast it's all Pacific if it's West
Coast Pacific Northwest like anyone from
Oregon through to Washington up like
through BC like along the west coast we
all sound the same okay yeah but can you
tell them no okay oh no like I could
meet someone from from Washington State
or from Oregon I'd have no idea that
they're all really know whereas like
eastern Canadian or like southern US
eastern US there you can pick it up like
pretty trouble
uh Toronto I don't notice much no not
really like like the metropolitan area
is not not too much okay um
alright so let's go ahead and talk about
this Clone Wars thing so this is
unfortunate Luke's not here on the show
today because he will either be amped
about this or he won't because I know
that he really liked the original series
and was super mad at sort of what
Disney's been doing with some aspects of
animated Star Wars so around on Cartoon
Network for five seasons is coming back
it was the adventures of Anakin and
obi-wan as well as some new characters
during the clone war fans praised its
ability to showcase a wide range of
stories characters and even genres and
it was cancelled after Disney's
acquisition of Lucasfilm with a final
batch of episodes known as the lost
missions airing on Netflix ah characters
of three elements were subsequently
incorporated into the animated series
Star Wars rebels which is more kiddie
and even into the latest film solo ok
fortunately that's not as but I still
haven't seen solo fortunately that's not
a spoiler for me though because I never
watched the Clone Wars so yesterday they
announced that Clone Wars will return
for twelve more episodes and it will air
on Disney's upcoming streaming service
and they appear to be the end of the
Clone Wars story so all they're doing is
kind of closing it out and they are
treating this as a way to get people
onto their streaming service as a
general consumer and not necessarily the
techy aspersion of all time how do you
feel about the concept of having to
subscribe to multiple streaming services
to access different shows so you know
how gaming used to all be on Steam oh
yeah yeah and then all of a sudden we
had EA origin oh I actually don't like
and then we had Ubisoft you play and now
we've got Epic Games long I know I know
yeah battle.net Game one I like to keep
it simple so would you simply issue a
new streaming service in favor of
simplicity and just go no I'm only going
to subscribe to one thing if you want me
to watch it that dad make sure it's on
let's say Netflix for example yeah like
if there's another service
I'd like Netflix mm-hmm I would
Mindy project this second season know
that I don't remember it was on Hulu
before yeah only on Hulu yeah so so you
just I wouldn't pay to what I worked
only on Netflix
I'm not gonna pay for it depends on how
much about this show though the office
is that gone on Netflix I will subscribe
to Hulu would you unsubscribe from
Netflix is the anchor show the most
important thing to you this is oh this
is interesting
okay I don't know if that if that
platform has like really other good
shows as well I would stop Netflix
really then I will follow that one okay
interesting so oh yeah Jake's gonna have
to come get it ah
all right so anyway Disney man it's
probably gonna be successful but I'm I'm
really frustrated because part of the
entire beauty of cable cutting was that
you could get rid of that you know at
least here anyway you know 72 over $100
monthly fee that you were paying and you
could replace it entirely with your
internet Plus maybe like if you get a
basic Netflix subscription or think of
it like $7.99 if you don't get 4k
night I don't know anymore I've got that
I've got the 4k one which i think is 13
oh yeah I only have 4k TV yeah so what's
up that oh I'm leaning back that's the
problem I can I can stop doing that I'm
sorry so that was the beauty of it was
that you could get all of your content
and your internet for for one low price
instead of having to get Internet and
content but now with more and more
content providers working on building
streaming platforms there's nothing
we're gonna be able to do if we want to
have access to an all-you-can-eat style
of content consumption there's nothing
we're going to be able to do to avoid
the the rates starting to creep up like
all of a sudden you're going to be
subscribed to Netflix and Hulu and
Disney
and you know Comcast Oh what's what's
that thing that the vessel team laughed
and went I mean for that matter
floatplane you might subscribe to
individual creators what's that
no not crave that's a local thing I
think oh I can't I can't remember it was
like something that I couldn't figure
out why anyone would care about
Verizon's
streaming service but there's so many I
think who doesn't work in Canada that's
Oh apparently they killed it in May
oh the Verizon TV streaming service is
probably oh wow oh wow these articles
are brutal
holy crap here hold on I'll screen share
with you guys so you can read along with
me here so this one is probably not
gonna happen this one's not too bad
Verizon is finally putting it's terrible
streaming service out to pasture says BG
are calm no one even seems to know what
it was gonna indie go 90 it made
multi-billion dollar takeovers of AOL
and Yahoo brands known for providing
email scams to seniors and leaking
billions of customer accounts wow this
is a very this is a very colored account
of things and now go ninety it's public
and very expensive millennial friendly
online streaming service I think the key
to creating something that doesn't
appeal to Millennials isn't trying to
target Millennials like what does that
even mean
what is a millennial oriented streaming
service well you're technically a
millennial one last note would
okay so Millennials I forget what
exactly the Millennial age here so it's
a it's a generation so anyone born
between 1981 and 1900 at the outer I'm
at the older end and you're I'm still
solidly in there so what would what
would appeal to you as a millennial what
appeal can I do like what exactly
exactly to me
money money forget I don't I don't know
you're a marketing executive okay you
have to market to Millennials oh my god
like something like fun that's fine
you're not a marketing executive okay
but speaking of marketing we've got some
sponsors for the show that I'm gonna

to do our website yeah - Media Group
comm cuz it's very out of date at this
point yeah my description - I know we
should just do it over wait what's wrong
with your description I think something
not cool not cool our team hold on a sec
yeah that's really old yeah it looks
really really old we've got to update
this his original placeholder bio said a
guy we need sometimes he knows how to
make videos but Linus is rewriting it
now so Dennis joined our team after
receiving a very strong recommendation
for his hard work and skill at both
shooting and editing videos under tight
deadlines several team members had
experience working with him at school oh
I guess I should screen share with you
guys so I went ahead with the hire after
a single interview which crime I just
basically wrote the same thing in ads
those defense what he wrote originally
wasn't actually that racist and was
mostly factual so this is IDI writing
something I think I saw a video were
writing it
and then Edie going back and editing it
which I actually hadn't seen do you
actually have something that could have
been perceived as being racist in there
before I don't remember maybe it's best
we not dig up these relics from our
history but we do need to update that

a couple of news topics now I feel like
why don't we get on that Apple's new
MacBook Pro thermal throttle is pretty
friggin hard so the original article
here is from 9 to 5 Mac I can't remember
if these guys were one of the ones that
unfairly slammed me over the iMac Pro
thing and now feels bad but hasn't said
anything actually were these guys the
ones that claimed in their article that
they reached out to me but actually I
never heard from them that would be
interesting maybe I don't want to
promote these guys nine-to-five Mac iMac
Linus
let's see aa story of resent
ill-informed youtuber oh no that's Apple
Insider hold on a second
iMac - broken let's see Apple Insider
MacRumors ok no ok I don't I don't
actually I don't actually see anything
on nine-to-five back ok cool nice guys 9
to 5 Mac here's how it throttles with
Final Cut Pro X exports yeah so we
actually did a stream of that today from
my office where after seeing Dave Lee's
video I was like ok well let's see how
long it'll take us from packaged to
thermal throttling with the MacBook Pro
with the 2018 MacBook Pro we got the
core I
version so that's like a $7000 notebook
that thermal throttles if you hit it
with a really intense load basically
immediately and then if you hit it with
a less intense load after like a couple
minutes it's pretty brutal and it's
something that I'm starting to not like
wonder if Apple is doing on purpose but
it's something that I'm starting to get
really frustrated that Apple is doing on
purpose
so the original MacBook you guys may or
may not remember this but we did a video
where we water-cooled it that was a
passively cooled machine if I recall
correctly it's been a while but we
water-cooled it by basically taking the
entire machine putting some like putty
in the screw holes and then like putting
it in a tray of water that wasn't so
deep that it would come up and go into
the ports or into the keyboard and we
were able to get something to the tune
of nearly double the performance out of
it but that was supposed to be a thin
inlaid it was supposed to be a computer
with unprecedented like unprecedented
like portability that was that was the
whole point of it and so this is a
pretty different type so so basically we
accepted it but now they're doing this
with professional machines like the iMac
Pro that thermal throttles like crazy
and we opened it up we saw the thermal
solution it was very clearly not going
to handle a vago graphics card and you
know up to an 18 core processor Apple
ships that thing with up to an 18 core
processor and then now this MacBook Pro
where they went and without making
significant changes to the thermal
solution which already had a hard time
with the core i7 that was in it before
then when they put two more computing
cores in it they wouldn't they put a
core I nine in it so your performance
actually isn't any better but Apple's
charging you more for it and on paper it
seems to be faster so it's gotten to the
point now where it looks not like bad
design but it looks like intentional
deception
like if you bought a car okay that was
600 horsepower instead of 400 horsepower
yes horsepower is not the be-all and
end-all of carb speed we know but if you
bought a car that was six hundred and
step four hundred horsepower but there
was some other component inside it that
limited it so that both of them
delivered 350 how mad would you be or if
you paid for the extra package and why
do they sell we done why do we explain
this from Apple I like you make it like
easy for the others then why trying to
say yeah now I get it cuz I I couldn't
anything you need to do ours was
throttling well under its base clock
even just doing things like exporting
and final cut very frustrating so I
don't know I just it so they have
something to limit their something well
the problem is that if you hit it with a
really hard load the CPU reaches 100
degrees basically instantly Oh and so
it'll it'll turn itself down to protect
itself that's that's safety mechanism
that intel has built into the chip
because otherwise I mean if you just let
it get as hot as it wants you could you
could cook on it and it would it would
burn itself out very quickly
Oh people are like Linus you aren't
supposed to encode on a laptop uh why
Stan's wearing two classes I'm also
wearing two shirts yeah yeah it's really
hot that's fine okay this is actually
how I wear my sunglasses oh really I
just put them over and really the other
I lost my the one with Chris
prescription what's wrong you can't
retail if this is yes you can can yes
sunglass hand telly that's the only the
same shape I'm seriously that I do that
every day and no one look at me like
weird ever I maybe you just can't tell
the difference between having a look at
you and how they look at you when you're
wearing two pairs of sunglasses
maybe the shirt was already enough that
they were gonna be looking at you
whatever way they oh man okay
in other news in an internal document
distributed to Apple Authorized service
there's Apple has confirmed the
third-generation keyboard on the 2018
MacBook Pro is equipped with a membrane
to quote prevent debris from entering
the butterfly mechanism so publicly
Apple has only said that it features an
improved third-generation keyboard for
quieter typing but some people suspected
that the silicon membrane was actually
to prevent crumbs from getting into it
and ruining it this is another thing
that's very frustrating about Apple that
they can't just communicate openly with
their audience like we make mistakes and
most of the time people are actually
pretty cool mm-hmm like if you're like
hey we screwed up sorry people will be
like cool just please don't do that
again
maybe the idea is that Apple doesn't
want to have that conversation because
if people say don't do that again
and they have they're already like the
and the channels of communication are
open then they have to commit not to do
it again and they don't want to is that
is that the issue here I don't know very
frustrating
in other news rise of the 3000 series
might have more than eight cores so I
guess this wouldn't be that huge of a
surprise I mean a big key of the design
of Andes Zen architecture there Rison
processors was the modular design that
allows them to kind of to use mm-hmm
Intel's terminology just glue processors
together so if they wanted to have if
they wanted to take thread Ripper let's
say from 16 cores last generation to up
to 32 cores this generation all they'd
have to do is glue together some CCX
modules so MSI has dropped a hint that
AMD might be countering Intel's rumored
eight core 11:51 processor with a 12
core processor so mainstream mainstream
computers are all of a sudden like
heavily heavily multi-core or at least
if these rumors are true that will be
true in the near future I'm personally
excited to see the next couple of years
as these trickle down to the actual
mainstream and we get to start
experiencing programs that were built
from the ground up for a very
Elte threaded world what else is cool um
w DS shutting down one of their hard
drive factories now to be clear it's not
like there it's not like this is their
only Factory and it's not like hard
drives are going like the one in
Malaysia
yeah same technique so they're just
they're just shutting down some of their
hard drive manufacturing I mean hard
drives are becoming less of a consumer
product and they're becoming more of an
enterprise product that's just the
transition that's happening or or
prosumer like we still have more hard
drives in the building than we do SSDs
fun fact do you know that I don't know
but the reason you don't know that is
that none of them are in your computer
Oh your laptop runs an SSD up your
desktop runs an SSD I don't even have a
hard drive but we could never run
anywhere near the kind of operation that
we do if we didn't have some hard drives
because the cost to capacity ratio for
hard drives is still much better than
solid-state drives so if you have any
kind of bulk data needs
you're gonna need hard drives for a long
time according server Oh according
announced Gorilla Glass six yes that's
what you need - that's fun that's why
you need look look look why you need it
you know what's funny is I've actually
broken very few screens in my day but I
finally broke my iPhone 6 like two
nights ago oh yeah I was I was listening
to something in the bathroom and I like
was grabbing a towel or something and I
kind of dropped it a bit and then when I
went to catch it I ended up like pushing
it with the towel or something instead
of actually catching it I thought you're
gonna effectively threw it at the floor
gone like it was it was propelled
towards the floor or face down boom
screen cracked it's funny unless I
dropped my phone so many time this is si
it's got a grip on it though Oh
sometimes you have it oh yeah I guess
you didn't okay so like neither scratch
I don't have any protection like it's
just so strong I don't know why
so Gorilla Glass 6 will apparently
survive up to 15 drops from 1 meter
height and can be up to 2 times better
than Gorilla Glass 5 now with that said
Gorilla Glass 5 wasn't known for being
the most impact resistant or was no that
one wasn't very scratch resistant it was
impact resistant so it should survive
drops from higher heights but more
importantly has been engineered to
survive multiple drops and it should
have the same amount of scratch
resistance as previous generations it's
in production now and is available to
smartphone makers so it's expected to
reach the market in the next several
months oh how much would I love it if
the rumored upcoming note device had
Gorilla Glass 6 that would be super
excite I think that's pretty much it
everything else in here Walmart might
launch a video streaming service oh oh
boy a more video streaming services
they're thinking of a service priced
below $8 a month because Netflix has
been steadily raising their prices which
are not dominate in 14 Amazon charges 9
they may also consider a no-cost
ad-supported service and they already
own Vudu I did not know that a service
for buying and renting movies and Vudu
launched its own ad supported streaming
service movies on us a few years ago
which I have never heard of which should
be which should give you some idea of
how well movies on us is doing and
that's it thank you for tuning in to the
wine show Thank You Dennis for joining
me on the LAN show and we will see you
guys again next week
wow that's so fast same bat-time same
bat-channel just remember they can hear
you right now
they can't
so yes they can unless sing a song no
they can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
