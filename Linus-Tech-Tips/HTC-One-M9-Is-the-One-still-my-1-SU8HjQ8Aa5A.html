for a 30 day test drive and thanks to
its clean responsive Sense UI and iPhone
light construction it became my new
daily driver
then when the One m8 follow-up launched
it became the second Android phone to
earn the my daily driver status for the
same reasons so now that the one m9 is
here is solid construction and a clean
Sense UI still enough
spoiler alert no but let's find out why
shall we
the Corsair HX 1200 eye power supply

quiet efficient power and corsair link

I guess these videos start with specs
right so there's an octet of CPU cores
for low power and for for high
performance three gigs of ddr3 RAM and
Adreno 430 GPU 32 gigs of built-in
storage wireless AC an FM radio and a
twenty point seven megapixel rear camera
all crammed inside the phones
characteristically premium feeling metal
enclosure then moving around to the
front we've got a 5.0 inch 1080p Super
LCD 3 display covered with Corning
Gorilla Glass 4 a 4 megapixel selfie
camera
HTC's characteristic and much better
sounding than the competition
front-facing stereo boomsound speakers
and the chin bar is back this was a big
warning sign for me I mean the chin bar
never actually bothered me in fact with
the move to on-screen buttons on the m8
making the device symmetrical was as
simple as rotating it the other way in
landscape mode so it was buttons on one
side and chin bar on the other and I
never really bothered with that anyway
because devices covered with screen and
buttons are actually kind of hard to
hold when you're watching videos in
landscape mode but the thing is a lot of
people are put off by it and leaving it
there snacks of either laziness or an
internal feeling at HTC of fearing to
break the mold something that they
proudly shouted from the rooftops that
they weren't afraid to do when the One
m7 launched as an oasis of beautiful
craftsmanship amongst the plastic junk
that past her flagship Android phones at
the time and the rest of the one m9 does
little to convince me otherwise we'll do
the obligatory physical tour but frankly
they didn't change much and IMO they
didn't change anything for the better
from the back we can only tell that the
device is marginally shoulder if we hold
it right next to the One m8 the asinine
secondary camera has been thankfully
removed in the lone camera with its dual
LED flash is now accompanied only by a
noise cancelling microphone and HTC
branding on the top is a large
i re Miller from Media Center control on
the left is the nano SIM tray on the
bottom we find a micro USB charging port
supporting Qualcomm quick charge 2.0 and
the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack that's
been again IMO unfortunately relocated
from the top where I prefer it on the
right is a microSD slot a very important
inclusion considering the galaxy s6
removed expandable storage and the worst
lock and volume control buttons I've
encountered in some time this is really
simple people they need solid tactile
feedback they need to be easily felt for
their position and differentiated from
each other without looking and no
putting a light texture on the lock
button doesn't count for that and they
can't be on opposing sides of the device
so you mash two buttons when you mean to
hit one and at least it gets the last
point right in fact I like the position
of the lock button in the volume rocker
it's easy to use right or left-handed
but everything else about these buttons
sucks back to the drawing board HTC the
good news is that while an ant X very
detailed analysis of the screen actually
found some more issues there other than
the lackluster maximum brightness
especially when compared to the galaxy
s6 there wasn't really anything that
jumped out to me is a huge issue
contrast is still very good something
that's more important past a certain
point than just throwing more resolution
at the problem so yes it's a 1080p
display but unless you're really pixel
peeping you'll literally never notice
and HTC's loyalty to LCD means that you
don't get that weird tinting from
certain angles that i've seen on the
droid turbo and galaxy s6 which I guess
leads us to the lollipop version of
Sense UI blinkfeed is still a really
pleasant way to browse social media
content and makes more sense for me
personally than Samsung's left swipe to
Flipboard that I totally forgot to
mention in my review it's still clean
and simple with meaningful customization
like accent color palettes to choose
from and customized ability of the
on-screen buttons not to mention the
awesome gear next to every volume slider
that gives you quick access to the other
ones but gestures are a little weak with
no ability to mix and match a gesture
and an action
if you're listening to music you just
plain can't use a gesture to launch the
camera since that particular locked-in
gesture relies on the volume up button
and device orientation but sense is
responsive and if you turn off the derpy
sense home widget that tries to be a v8
by showing only the most relevant apps
when you're at home or work or out and
about but in my experience just kind of
gotten away with your relevant
suggestions and downloads folders and
the prime locations on the right-hand
side that can't be moved and poor
organization of the rest I'll just use a
v8 or organize my ads myself thanks
it is pretty good which leads us into
another low point for the phone however
the camera is just plain not competitive
sorry HTC the ultra pixel gambit didn't
seem to work out and they've gone for a
more traditional camera setup and while
it actually compares reasonably
favorably to the Droid turbo that I use
that's kind of like saying it runs as
fast as the kid carrying a diesel
generator on his back they improved auto
white balance and removed the
head-scratcher of a second camera but at
only 50 dollars less than the galaxy s6
off contract not to mention that it
doesn't come with a quick charge wall
wart like the s6 does the one m9 needs
to do more than that I mean in no
particular order it needs faster
autofocus faster shutter button response
a flash that works under 15 percent
battery life a clearer image preview
while taking pictures tuning of the
noise reduction on low-light pictures
that makes them basically a total mess
right now
optical image stabilization a wider
angle lens on the selfie camera and just
a I mean I don't want to be unfair it's
not like these test shots and test
footage are unexcusable or unusable or
anything it's just that the galaxy s6
exists unfortunately and I'll pay a
little extra for the better experience
and the use of glass instead of whatever
rubbish HTC uses on their lens cover on
the back I actually had one of my to
review units crack the lens cover during
totally normal use with no drops which I
would normally chalk up to a fluke and
not mention if I hadn't had the same
damn thing happened with my one m8 not
to mention that
she gave me the runaround and wanted to
charge me for the replacement of it even
though it was a documented issue with
the phone which I guess leads us into
the conclusion for the video the one m9
is just a phone it's a good phone and
one with an SD card slot if you're into
that but it's just a phone every other
flagship grabs my attention in some
compelling way whether it's the camera
of the s6 the water resistance of an
Xperia tipo solid even great build
quality and a clean Android skin was
enough two years ago but it isn't
anymore and while I applaud HTC for
offering a free replacement for a
cracked screen or water damage within
the first year that only has a value to
me if I already own the device and I
think HTC is going to need another
reinvention to stand out against their
much stronger competition than what the
one had to work with in the first place
speaking of standing out you know what
else stands out the high quality 3m
vinyl wraps that D brand uses to make
your phone or other device look
absolutely kick-ass like the one m9 that
you guys have been looking at for the
last eight or so minutes dbrand provided
us with two units of the one m9 so I
could decide which skin style I liked
better and I definitely liked the one
that actually wraps right around all the
little buttons on the sides it's truly
remarkable what a great job they do with
these it's not just about the quality of
the vinyl either getting the cutting
just right so that it fits your device
perfectly is a real trick and they do
more than just phones whether it's a
game console game controller notebook
computer or whatever else that you want
to personalize there's an affordable D
brand skin for you I mean even if you're
not planning to buy one it's actually
worth checking it out head over to D
brand calm we've got it linked in the
video description and try playing around
with the different color schemes on
there builder on their site it's
actually pretty fun so I think that's
pretty much it guys like the video if
you liked it dislike it if you thought
it sucked
