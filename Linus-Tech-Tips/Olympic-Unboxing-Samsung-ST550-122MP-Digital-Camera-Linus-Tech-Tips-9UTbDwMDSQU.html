front of the Olympic rings here in
Vancouver while Richmond I guess at the
airport so today we're gonna be having a
quick look at the samsung s t5 50 one of
the big innovations of this camera is
the fact that it has an LCD on the front
as well as one on the back which allows
you to easily take photos of yourself
and well okay you can see they
demonstrated clearly what they want you
to be doing with it okay so it is a 12
point two megapixel camera with a 4.6 X
optical zoom it's actually raining a
little bit so this is I'm gonna be in a
bit of a rush here sorry about that in
advance but the first thing we find
inside is the Samsung Quick Start manual
and there's also a driver and utilities
cd-rom okay thank you for that let's
have a look at what's included in terms
of accessories so we have oh that's kind
of neat okay we've got a USB - Wow
whatever that is I'm guessing this is a
proprietary charging cable okay so this
could be used for data transfer or for
oh I I hate that I hate that already so
that could be for data transfer or for
power and then they also provide you
with a USB power plug for your wall okay
that's pretty nice of them to include so
then also inside here we have a battery
okay so there is alright what is that
that's a rechargeable lithium ion
battery 3.7 volts so you're gonna have
to put that into the camera yourself
which is fine and then we have the
camera itself the St 550 so I'm gonna go
ahead and I wish I could put this box
down because here I'll get it to the
camera and that works okay so there it
is we've got kind of a shiny finish to
the front of it okay you got there is it
your 4.6 times optical zoom you got 12.2
megapixel there's your flash you can't
actually see from the front of the
camera unless you look at it from the
right angle can you see that can you see
the the screen okay so the screen is
right there it's big enough that you
could easily hold it in front of you and
see yourself in it but then you've also
got a very large screen on the back is
this how do you even control this thing
it must be touch sensitive hold on give
me two seconds here okay let's have a
look at what they say on the front suite
it is a touch screen on the back okay so
here's the full sort of run down here
you've got the 1.5 inch front LCD three
and a half inch wide touchscreen LCD on
the back it has haptic effect okay smart
auto intelligence and then it supports
HD movie recording so you can shoot in
1280 by 720 if you're shooting videos
here's your zoom control here's your
play button to review your photos and
yeah thank you for checking out the st5
oh yeah there's that proprietary USB
connection on the bottom I know I don't
really like to see those I'd rather see
us a normal USB mini connector but what
are you gonna do here's where you put in
the phone
oh yeah the battery as well as a micro
SD card really Wow
that's kind of weird yeah it looks like
this supports micro SD okay well thank
you for checking out my quick unboxing
and overview of the
st 550 Samsung digital camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
