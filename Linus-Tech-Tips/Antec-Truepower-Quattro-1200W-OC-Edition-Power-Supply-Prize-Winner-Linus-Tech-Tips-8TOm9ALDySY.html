subscribers and I realized that it kind
of happened on the weekends and I let it
sort of slide I haven't given away the
Cointreau 1200 watt power supply yet
I've been working my way up to this okay
so I had some people complain previously
above my my strategy for giving away
product you know i was using some kind
of fail apple program to generate random
numbers and someone pointed out to me
well why didn't you just take your total
number of subscribers put it into
random.org which i now have open here
and then just just generate a subscriber
and then navigate to that person and I
didn't really have an answer for why I
didn't do that so I am going to do that
this time so first I'm going to go to
Linus tech tips and i'm going to refresh
the page really quick just to make sure
that we're getting all of the potential
subscribers entered here and now it's
gone and started a video just turn that
off okay so 10,000 178 subscribers so we
need a random number between one and ten
thousand 178 we are going to generate
the random number this is to win the
quattro 1200 watt OC edition power
supply alright so here comes the
suspense and boom generate 6772 so we
are going to go find subscriber 6772 and
then we are going to ensure that they
are oh no no that's not what I meant to
do we're going to ensure that that
person is subscribed to both of my
channels linus tech tips as well as NCIX
calm so there we go so they should be
the first result on this page so they're
going to show up in this spot right here
ready been
wait for it wait for it okay maybe
apples are stupid and that doesn't work
okay here we go so it's Afghani one so
we're going to go into Afghani ones
subscriptions and there it is right
there he's not subscribed to many things
so it's right there NCIX tech tips

subscription so congratulations Afghani
