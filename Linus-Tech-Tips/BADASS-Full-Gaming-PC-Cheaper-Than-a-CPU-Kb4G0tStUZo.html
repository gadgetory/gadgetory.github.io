observed that with the $1,700 price tag
you could probably build a pretty wicked
computer the whole thing for less than
just the price of a singular processor
and have money for great peripherals I
had a few people tweet me saying that I
should actually do it and make a video
about it so here we are but I threw a
bit of a challenge at the Linus tech
tips community forum I asked them to
configure the best all-around system for
under seventeen hundred dollars let's
see who won why and how it performs
master op is featuring the minivan
custom keyboard which comes in a
forty-percent form factor with various
customization options check it out at
other drops in the video description
down below through browsing all the
submissions I noticed trends components
that seem to define this price category
or even certain specs that I would just
gravitate towards personally I left the
contest fairly open-ended and let the
community show me what they could do
then after skimming all the submissions
I made a list of things that I found to
be requirements and started judging in
my opinion the best most well-rounded
can do it all computer was configured by
someone with one of the greatest names I
have ever read herman mcpoot Asst but
there is more to this man than just his
name and we'll start with the processor
that they chose the 6700 K I liked the
inclusion of an i7 for tasks like
streaming or video editing or anything
else that can take advantage of the
additional threads this was largely a
6600 K versus 6700 K showdown in terms
of processor and being able to squeeze
in the i7 was great I appreciated the
inclusion of a 240 millimeter all-in-one
water cooler but this wasn't a
requirement I found that anyone with the
like hyper 212 Evo level cooler and up
received a pass in this category the
motherboard wasn't anything to
necessarily phone home about but the
features are solid with an overclocking
ready chipset USB type-c connector on
the back and all the other basic
necessities someone is likely to
desire nothing too special but not
overly lacking either much like the 16
gigabytes of g.skill ripjaws v-series
memory the capacity of which I saw as a
baseline for this build as it's easy to
fit in the budget and gives you
expansion room by only using two of your
expected for RAM slots
moving on to storage is where some of
the more aggressive requirements started
to show up people with SSDs that were
under about 240 gigabytes or a hard
drive that was under about 2 terabytes
were knocked off almost immediately at
this price point you shouldn't be making
major compromises in any category
luckily for Hermann mcpoot Asst he met
both of these requirements right on the
line for graphics card it was a battle
of the gtx 1070 versus 1080 this price
point was a little high for an RX 480
and the gtx 1060 but i did find that
people who pushed for the 1080 fell
short in some other category and as the
1070 is an extremely powerful card he
got a pass the case is solid enough and
carries through the white and black
theme that has been maintained thus far
the power supply has more than enough
wattage to power everything an 80 plus
gold efficiency rating and should be
built well enough in order to not light
everything on fire so that's a plus the
monitor he chose is 1440p which is great
resolution pairing for the gtx 1070 it
is a beautiful IPS panel and a 4
millisecond delay meaning it's not
exactly going to be the fastest gaming
monitor out there but can do the job as
long as you're not trying to go MLG pro
or some crap like that the Corsair
Vengeance k-6 t5 compact 10 keyless
keyboard is a solid choice especially at
that price point and the Logitech G 302
paired with that gives you a great
combined hands-on experience for your PC
so how does it perform it destroys
gaming benchmarks at 1440p nothing below
60 FPS average and all of the games were
heavy hitting titles including the newer
Tomb Raider Crysis 3 and hitman and all
of them were maxed freaking settings
1440p very high ultra all that fun stuff
no compromises here and then for our
synthetic CPU test it also smashed in
both the multi
rated benchmark and the single-threaded
benchmark cities skylines we included
this game because it is CPU bound and
very heavily 58 FPS that's damn close to
60 and finally game streaming while
streaming using xsplit at 1080p 30fps we
were able to get sixty eight point five
nine frames per second in Tomb Raider
that's insane and that's while still
playing Tomb Raider at 1440 P max
settings sick how's that for a
conclusion thanks for watching guys if
this video sucked you know what to do
but if it's awesome get subscribed hit
the like button or check out the link in
the video description for where to buy
all this stuff or a shirt if you want to
do that as well
let me know in the comments down below
if you want to see more videos like this
should I do more like community
showdowns where we get a bunch of people
to try to configure rig at a specific
price point like maybe a price point for
the new Titan X which is really
expensive or just more logical price
points like a budget bill there were
like a high end build or something like
that let me know comments down below or
on twitter at linus tech check out this
video where i wasn't in it because it's
a channel super fun video that was
recent and it wasn't the chocolate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
