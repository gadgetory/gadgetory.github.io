the computer in the late 70s and early
80s they got small enough to fit on a
desk by the 90s we could fit them in our
laps and for the last 11 years the
dominant personal computers have been
the ones that we all carry around in our
pockets which I guess means we're kind
of overdue for a change yeah
introducing the Nubia Alpha the wrist
phone with a giant flexible OLED display
that wraps around your wrist this might
be the worst product that I have ever
fallen in love with and let me tell you
why
voting on the builds Gigi stock cooling
showdown is open so head over to the to
contest pages vote for your favorite
entered builds and earn balance towards
a random draw for awesome hardware
prizes we're gonna have that linked
below
let's begin with the promotional
materials shall we
what does Nubia imagine that the Alpha
is okay we got a clock theme going on
here this guy is talking on the phone
hmm
so many functions thanks the larger
screen and Wow
video chat oh wow so that looks pretty
good and you know what I don't even
think they're that far off flexible
displays have been a long time coming
and now that they're finally reaching
the point of commercialization I really
think that they're one of the best hopes
for wearable technology to really take
off because if you think about it up
until now the vast majority of smart
wearables have been limited to the same
sizes and configurations of the previous
dumb wearables like watches and glasses
because they're made of fundamentally
the same metal and glass materials so
that puts restrictions on their designs
that can affect everything from their
battery life to their screen size and
even the ways that we can interface with
them so it's this last one that I'm
gonna address first on the Alpha so
right now I'm enabling a feature that
they've called alpha gesture what it
essentially does is allow you to
navigate through the functions and menus
without actually touching the screen so
it's similar to some of the hand wavey
controls that are present on some cars
except that it's implemented on a device
that by its very definition is always
close enough that you could easily reach
out and touch it
so I'm gonna go ahead and turn that off
and also it didn't work consistently at
all with it enabled sometimes I'd touch
it and then it would actually activate
twice once for the touch and once for
the alpha gesture for now the thing that
I like about it is that it's a preview
of what's to come with like holographic
displays that you can wear on your wrist
and interact with in 3d space that's
going to be pretty cool now I want to
talk about the size so yeah it still
goes on your wrist like a regular watch
or Smart Watch but there were a handful
if they
that immediately stood out to me
starting with how much information could
be present on the screen at one time now
at four inches and quite narrow the
screen is not exactly panoramic but it's
way bigger than any other SmartWatch
that I've ever used and unlike a desktop
monitor where I have yet to find a super
wide display that I don't like this is
an application where more height
actually kind of makes more sense to me
so if a text or an email were to come in
I don't necessarily need a bunch of
extraneous space on the side I want to
have as much of the content as possible
right in my field of view and a longer
display lets me read the average text or
even a short email without any scrolling
required or I mean at least it would
have if this thing managed to stay
paired to my phone for longer than a
couple of hours at a time but that short
fall actually reminds me of another
thing I like about the interface when I
first put it on I was trying to see
something at the top of the display and
I found myself thinking it oh gee this
is really not very comfortable but you
can actually adjust certain UI elements
up or down depending on what's most
ergonomic for you so I can kind of
imagine a future then where my
wraparound display is like positionally
aware and if I'm you know sitting at a
desk it could it could throw a discrete
little notification up where only I can
see it I mean that would be perfect for
checking your text during a bad date or
something like that
now in its current form it's now in its
current form the Alpha falls well short
of this mark having no awareness of its
position in space other than detecting
usually my check the time gesture and
mostly forgetting where I left things
and
even allowing some key UI elements to be
moved around like entering Wi-Fi
passwords so this is again something
that I can kind of see where they're
going with even if the experience isn't
there now on the top of the experience
the experience of wearing the Alpha is
really something that's going to depend
heavily on the user so it can be easily
resized by removing links from either
both or one side it was a touch big on
me even at its smallest size though so
that's something to be aware of and it's
a little on the bulky side but still
lower profile than other multifunction
smartwatches that I've worn daily in the
past like the casio pro track and i
didn't have any trouble getting sleeves
on and off around it now the always-on
display functionality i'm always harping
on smartwatches that don't have it well
it's not enabled at this time but while
it is still using an older snapdragon
2100 processor not very power efficient
I do actually believe them when they say
they will turn that back on in the
future since after one really buggy day
when it died in like four hours
I've actually regularly gotten more than
a day's worth of battery out of the
Alpha the standout thing for me about
wearing it is definitely its value as a
conversation starter thanks to its large
wraparound screen it's an attention
grabber that looks more like a cool prop
out of a sci-fi movie than something
that you can actually go to a store and
buy today
personally I love it I think it looks
super cool but I've had others even here
on staff where we're all admittedly a
bunch of nerds suggests that giving
these to high school kids would cause
teen pregnancy rates to plummet I'm
pretty sure that if thirty percent of
high schoolers were wearing that you
would have teen pregnancy just plummet
haters gonna hate I guess but I think
the future really is large wearable
screens like this one and the key word
here is future the Alpha does not do a
great job of using its large screen real
estate overall the default watch face
dedicates a shocking amount of space to
function toggles with the bottom
occupied by some Reese
that's that frankly I think are just as
easy to access by simply swiping to the
side and finding the relevant one
especially given how few there are but
the thing is that's hardly even the
biggest problem with the Alpha you'll
find that right in the name I can only
guess they called it the alpha because
it hadn't got to the point where they
were comfortable calling it beta yet the
vibration motor is among the worst I've
encountered this decade making it feel
more like it's trying to escape from
your wrists than apples tight purposeful
haptic feedback multiple notifications
from a single app aside from just piling
on and making that noise you heard
earlier will in some cases actually
remove the first notification so if
someone sends you a joke in hangouts
followed by wall or an emoji or
something you'll actually have to pull
out your phone to find out what was so
darn funny there's no way at this time
to handle media control for third-party
apps so you can copy music files over to
your watch and listen to them directly
from there over like Bluetooth
headphones but that's it the ringtone
cannot be adjusted a feature that's been
a given for a couple of decades now it's
got this whole entire part of the
interface that's dedicated to all these
exercises that can track free workout
and heartrate and outdoor running and
all that stuff but with this glitch that
registered my daily steps that negative
60,000 I don't know how seriously I'm
gonna be taking any of that and finally
while I'm nitpicking the camera kind of
sucks but newbie is justification for it
existing at all is video chat there's
only one small problem how is this more
ergonomic than this
I mean if they're pitching this with
isom support in China currently as a
full-on replacement for a phone I think
the point is there is clearly a lot of
work to do but I do see the vision with
WeChat Aldi Pei and a few other key apps
someone with full support in China could
take calls pay for their groceries and
navigate around town without ever
needing to take a phone oh it's just
that the experience is far too buggy to
be ready for primetime in fact if I had
a dollar for every time I saw this crash
message over the last couple of weeks I
could probably just buy myself a cheap
phone but I guess that's the nature of
the beast with these first concept that
somehow made its way to a store shelf
type products and even if I'm not going
to be daily driving this thing any time
soon I'm really glad that Nubia sent it
over to me because it was certainly
worth having the experience the math
drop cost porta pro-x headphones are
actually based on the original 1984 cost
design they've been updated to make them
more modern and durable but they're
portable they're on air and they can be
folded up in different configurations
for easy storage
they feature oxygen free copper voice
coils that provide a wide frequency
response and warm and smooth sound the
single button control lets you skip
tracks make calls and activate voice
commands and they've got a noise
cancelling mic with classes lifetime
warranty so why don't you join the drop
