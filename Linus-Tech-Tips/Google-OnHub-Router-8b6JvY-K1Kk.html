page some of the first text you run into
is that the on hub gives you fast Wi-Fi
good good to know it also states that
the on hub speaks human that it's
helpful feedback and simple set up will
be easy to use
we will check these things out and we'll
test its performance to see if it's
worth a damn so stay tuned to find out
and hit that like button below if you
want to see me investigate the
diminishing returns of adding more fans

this router is a collaboration between
Google and tp-link but why you might ask
that's a very valid question it seems
like the combined attack is designed to
conquer the frustration of people who
don't want to or don't know how to go
through the advanced process of setting
up your network and the on hub also
seems to be designed specifically for a
Wi-Fi signal crowded apartment which can
kind of be a warzone for certain routers
it can cause a huge amount of signal
reception issues in terms of specs this
2-pound 7.5 inches tall 4.6 inch
diameter flowerpot esque router is
packing a dual-core 1.4 gigahertz
processor 4 gigs of emmc flash one gig
of ddr3 L memory one USB 3.0 port a 3
watt speaker ambient light sensor 6
tricolor LED arrays Bluetooth 4.0 802
point 15 point 4 conformance Gigabit LAN
broadcasted by 6 2.4 gigahertz antennas
and 6 5.0 gigahertz antennas and finally
a single lonely Gigabit LAN port with
one more thing let's not forget the last
single 2.4 gigahertz antenna which we'll
talk about later so yeah I hear ya a
standard 1900 megabit per second AC
Wi-Fi router with 1 Gigabit LAN out
connection for 200 bucks it needs to
prove itself and we'll get to that in a
moment but first there are a few
oddities in that spec list that we
should explore now that single 2.4
gigahertz antenna that's kind of off by
itself is actually just a dedicated
antenna for finding the most appropriate
channel to broadcast on which is
actually pretty cool it will search
every about 5 minutes I believe and it
won't switch channels unless you're not
really using the internet so that can be
kind of handy so that it can be the most
efficient for you when you get home but
the Bluetooth radio the USB 3.0 port and
all that compliance gear is all kind of
off at the moment of filming and this
certain speakers like the 3 watt speaker
are kind of
not properly utilized in my opinion then
there's the ambient light sensor like
what do you do anyways this will all be
working for Google on in the form of a
brillo enabled device using the common
language protocol called
weave but as far as I know there isn't
anything out that can communicate with
the google onhub in this way yet you're
paying for all that compatibility now
the value of this part of the onhub is
currently just a giant question mark so
this is the on hub in the box you'll get
a kind of power brick thing that's
plugged into the wall already two
ethernet cables
that'll come wrapped up like this
they're flat which is pretty nice but
they're not all that long neither is the
wall power plug thing it's kind of
interesting because it a lot of their
product stuff they show it on shelves
like bookshelves and whatnot and that
might be fairly difficult for some
people to get power in Ethernet to so I
don't know about that but if you could
make it work then it can't does actually
look pretty good we have the blue one
there's a black one as well on the
bottom of the onhub you'll see kind of a
half circle symbol right below where it
says on hub that will line up with
another half circle at the bottom to
take the outer shell off all you have to
do is turn it so that it lines up with
the dot and then you can lift it off I
already have it plugged into Ethernet
and power and you can see at the top
there's a blue ring there's a piece of
paper somewhere that I don't remember
where it is right now but it basically
says a solid blue ring means that you're
good to go
a teal ring means that it's ready to be
set up and an amber ring means that
there's a problem and no light means
well it's not receiving power which is
fairly self-explanatory I've already
downloaded the app so let's get going
so in the app now it is actually very
simple but there's a few cool things
like this is how it uses the three watt
speaker first off it finds the on hub
but then it communicates a secret code
through audio it's kind of interesting
you'll see in a sec alright so now we
got the code it's going to connect to
the on hub just setting up the wireless
Navy please don't use a password that
bad for anything ever
and that's it now we're in the app it's
pretty straightforward in Wi-Fi access
you can reveal your password and even
actually share your password using this
button through social media or email or
whatever I don't really recommend using
this password and I don't really
recommend using that because having a
full copy of your password on the cloud
somewhere is probably not the most
secure way to do things now I'm gonna
have to change this a little bit because
as it is complaining I have another
router on this network and I'm not
bringing that one down so I'm going to
turn this into bridge mode then we're
going to test it against the ruckus our
7:10 this is not going to be a very fair
test this router is like over $1,200 and
this one is $200 but we can see kind of
how good it is in general and have a
kind of best possible scenario
comparison against it okay so now we're
actually testing the ruckus and the
onhub what I'm going to use for testing
them is the Wi-Fi adapter that runs off
of the x99 deluxe board that we have the
reason for that is this is actually the
only thing that can receive three by
three MIMO Wi-Fi connections that we
have so I have to haul this thing around
it can be super annoying don't worry
about it I've already tested the on hub
and the on hub is currently unplugged
we're going to be testing in a whole
bunch of different scenarios when we
testing in here just kind of across the
table we testing through the wall in the
benchmarking room through the wall and a
bunch of random metal stuff and a few
other things in the library and then
also upstairs in Linus's office that I'm
going to do a range test while just like
watching a twit stream and walking and
waiting till it disconnects so this is
the first test like I said I already
have the on hub numbers and we're going
to do a file transfer test not a speed
test net because it's more
representative we have an SSD array
server so file transfer speeds should be
fine so first thing I'm going to do is
going to try transferring the test file
from the server to our computer just
pass one minute and 20 seconds almost
done done one minute 24 seconds and I'm
going to upload from the computer to the
server
one minute 51 seconds one minute 28
seconds point one one twenty two point
four two minutes and seven seconds point
eight so we were connected to turn up
Wi-Fi as you can see turn up Wi-Fi is
our onhub router now I'm just going to
jump over here we are watching a twitch
TV show this is faceit TV and we're just
going to kind of walk out of the office
and see how far we can go until it
disconnects still totally working I'm
going to go towards this construction
site up it's buffering but I'm not
entirely sure if that's the routers
problem yes I have lost my router signal
it's got some pretty hardcore stuff to
contend with but I'm wondering the
ruckus might win this one all right so
now we're gonna do the range walking
test just like we did with the onhub but
with the ruckus our 710 going out the
door still working still connected to
Wi-Fi
oh no I'm off Wi-Fi now so I've lost
Wi-Fi so our very unscientific range
test has shown that the ruck is our
seven ten made it to here and the onhub
made it three four five six seven random
Luke sidesteps
further whatever that means and we're
back and that was not expected
I went pitching a two hundred dollar
router against a $1,200 ap in an AP
style test you'd expect the $1,200 ap to
just completely run away with everything
and that's not actually what happened
the onhub won in most scenarios granted
not by a lot but it did and in some
scenarios it was a fairly significant
amount that being said there was the one
random test in the editing den where the
ruckus just totally ran away with it the
one time but that's not that significant
in the grand scheme of things it didn't
represent all the other tests that we
ran and then even when we did the
walking test outside it's still lost and
by a pretty significant amount that
being said it was still running quite
fast and
because his strength is focused around a
massive amount of users which I can't
really represent here all that well I'm
not a school I can't have like 30
different students with phones and
laptops all running at the same time I
actually don't have enough devices for
that not being said I could get a pretty
heavy load but it the onhub has a really
strong CPU for a router in it for like a
random 200 dollar router so it might be
able to kind of keep up with that as
well
it was interesting I'm very impressed
with the onhub but it comes down to a
few different things you lose a lot of
your customized ability you can't change
a huge amount of options on the on hub
you can almost change nothing you can
set into bridge mode you can change your
password is not much more than that to
be completely honest whereas the ruckus
you have total control over a huge
amount of stuff especially if you get
the control hub thing and there's always
the kind of freaky part about what data
exactly is Google taking off of this
there's what they tell us they're taking
off of it but tinfoil hat on they could
definitely be taking more anyways for
the value it actually seems really
strong it's an extremely extremely
competent router for $200 with mystery
features coming in the future
