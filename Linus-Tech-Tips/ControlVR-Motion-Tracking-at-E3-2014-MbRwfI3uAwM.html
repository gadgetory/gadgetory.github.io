alright guys we're here at control VR to
check out easily the the most impressive
demo I've seen at any convention so far
if I can stroke your ego a little bit
more with the CEO so what how does this
work so what what control VR is doing is
we are providing users of virtual
realities such as oculus the opportunity
to put their hands in the game which is
something that has never been done
before and it's really solving the
biggest issue that's been facing the the
VR industry which is you know it's one
thing to be able to see an environment
in 3d but how does one then see himself
in that experience and once you try it
it really is hard to go back without it
and so the way it works is we're using a
form of advanced wearable technology and
so these were tiny little sensors that
were originally developed for military
applications that over time we've been
able to adapt and shrink the size down
where we can play sensors on each of
your fingers and have complicated
algorithms that basically are able to
then create a language that is sends
back to your operating system exactly
how your fingers are moving and it's a
real real achievement it's it's it's
completely surreal because there's a few
things though right now where you can
get like your arm moving but it's
usually very not very well st. and your
fingers aren't going to move with it on
like and stuff and when you put this
thing on and you get the oculus on and
the first thing you do is lift your hand
up and start wiggling your fingers
that's the weirdest thing ever and it
feels amazing what can we see coming
from you guys in the future sure so
where we're at right now you can you can
get the development kit on Kickstarter
it's going to be running for another
couple weeks and then what you can
expect from us in the future is to get a
great SDK we want to provide our
community the best tools possible so
that they can go and create the
applications that really
speak to them you know we're very
passionate about this technology and
about the potential for really changing
the world with it because it starts with
gaming but also then you know goes into
physical therapy applications
potentially robotics you know there's
there's really a lot of different
applications for this so what you can
expect from us is to get a quality
product with an easy-to-use SDK and then
from there you know we've already begun
working on you know the plans for the
commercial product and what you can
expect in the future as a commercial
product is and we're going to offer a
wireless solution for this and then I
think the the thing that we're most
excited about is the incorporation of
feedback into into the system and so
when you think about having a controller
for virtual reality you want to be able
to also experience that that sensation
when you reach out and touch something
that you're touching it so the real huge
hurdle has been what we've accomplished
now and you know including a feedback
system something we're already working
on and is something that in comparison
is is not nearly as complicated so we're
excited to provide that as soon as we
can and as soon as the products ready
and we feel like it's ready for consumer
market where we just want to get it out
there as quick as possible and that's
that's really important and being able
to link that together years gonna have
an sdk so being on the link both of
those together will be really helpful
one really important thing about
immersion is that all of your senses are
immersed and with oculus you only really
get the one you only get vision so being
able to pull in touch and movement is
very important and something that a lot
of people don't necessarily understand
yeah sure in a driving game if you have
a model whose hands are fixed to the
wheel at all points in time and you have
a wheel in front of you it might work
but there's not honestly that many
situations where that's perfect so it's
nice to see you guys trying to tackle
two extremely important components of VR
so that people going to actually get
this experience what is your final
vision for VR in general the whole
experience
sure so you know the final vision is
something that I can't even articulate
because we don't know where it's going
to go it's like sort of like the
internet it's not-it's a very powerful
thing that's out there and it'll evolve
as people develop different applications
for it so you know I ultimately want to
see this as a tool that improves the
world and improves communication I think
it's going to be amazing for the
classroom so the idea of a classroom
full of you know 10 year olds that are
able to go to the to the to the Louvre
in Paris and be able to walk around and
you know talk to each other once you do
social VR it's one of the most powerful
experiences that you'll have because you
realize that we have a future ahead of
us where we're going to be able to
connect with people that we usually
would not be able to connect with in a
real meaningful way so ultimately I I'm
just excited to see where where the
community takes it for sure there's
there's a couple things in that I wanna
that I want to branch on one is being
able to bring this to the communities
insane because how much this is
traditionally expensive insanely
expensive device and the fact you guys
are getting it at a fairly affordable
amount is just nuts and then you brought
up being able to go to the Louvre it's
this might make history class
interesting that's that's probably the
first time I've ever been able to say
that like I said one of the worst
possible subjects in school that's like
wow I can actually go to these different
places and experience that in real life
and the social interaction that you were
talking about the most insane experience
I've been saying this is the greatest
demo ever but easily the greatest part
of the greatest demo ever was when I'm
in this demo environment which is the
space environment which is like pretty
cool but it's not the most compelling
demo ever and then you walk over and you
see the other person that's in the demo
and you wave at them and they wave back
and you're like oh that's so cool and
you see like the little micro movements
because you just both got excited that's
not that instantly made that demo which
is like kind of cool absolutely amazing
and when you get into things like you
can sell the Kickstarter demo there's a
bunch of people there and you're all
just like playing around with food
throwing like ping-pong balls around and
like just doing whatever that's crazy
it's not necessarily about this this
testing environment which is essentially
what it is it's about what you do
the testing environment so that is super
super cool how is someone going to go
about getting one of these like I know
the Kickstarter has 23 24 days or
something whenever you guys see this
might be different but like at what
tears you can be able to get different
levels of this voice sure so these two
the entry point is ten dollars in which
case you get an SDK and it's going to
allow you as a developer to see how you
could incorporate this and start
developing for for the platform you can
get a one arm system for 350 and then
the complete experience is 600 for the
full upper body motion capture with your
fingers which is absolutely unheard of
you know in overtime we're going to
continue to do everything we can to
drive the the price of the system and
the sensors down and i think that the
solution that we're providing is
something that is going to change your
world so you know what it already did
yeah well thank you and we want everyone
to go out and you know support the
kickstarter and and help us you know
realize this vision that that's being
created and be a part of history that's
fantastic if you're an indie developer
that ten dollar sdk is really not that
hard to get into or if you're someone
who just wants this like you said
there's the one arm experience there's
the full body for 600 any of that kind
of stuff that'll really help i'm super
excited for this i think we're gonna
have to sign off so i don't stay here
for an hour but thanks again for showing
us Laura that was absolutely fantastic
thanks to hyperx corsair and ncx for
sending us to this e3 like seriously we
wouldn't i wouldn't been able to
experience this awesome demo if it
wasn't for them so thank you very much
I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
