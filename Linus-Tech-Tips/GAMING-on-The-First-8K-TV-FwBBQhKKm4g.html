experience alongside you guys today
the first 8k consumer television the Q
900 R series from Samsung it has a
whopping 33 million pixels now to be
clear we've seen 8k displays before but
only on the desktop at sizes that are so
small that you couldn't possibly hope to
get any benefit from it this this
promises to be different so in today's
video sponsored by Samsung we're going
to be going through the experience of 8k
on a 65 inch TV and also experiencing
some of the pitfalls of being such an
early adopter of such bleeding-edge
technology
Wow it's Rick it's a flip boy look at
that I don't think I've seen a TV this
thick in quite some time
I wonder if that has something to do
with they can do like the flush mount oh
that's so cool yeah they've got the legs
just right in here so if you like
mounted you don't have to worry about
losing interesting you know what I
wonder is if it has to do with the
powerful backlight that you need to
generate what is it like 3,000 is on
this thing so something a lot of people
don't know is that the tighter you make
the matrix of your LCD the harder it is
to beam light through it because the
more of the actual screen area is
covered by you know opaque things like
wires so I would guess they need one
heck of a backlight to get that kind of
brightness okay now what I guess is
lifted up yeah we probably should read
how to do it but uh well it's too late
for that now the ship has sailed
you put your left TV in you put your
left TV yeah put your left TV yeah so
idea of multiple spots that you can put
it just like here oh yeah how about that
all right where do you want to go let's
go with the wide stance that's what I
was doing oh yes do you ever just think
that you probably should have read the
instructions do you ever think that you
as the writer for this video probably
should have read the instructions did it
it needs a screw doesn't it it
definitely needs a screw but it also
probably should just like go in uh-huh
- where are those screws ah well there
we go there's your problem
oh that's a heavy one connect us the
manual a
now we've got it Wow you can really tell
this thing needs cooling though and if
the number of heat pipes that I can see
through the back of this grill at the
rear of the TV is anything to go by it
takes some serious power I wonder how
close they were to just like strapping a
fan on the back you know I gotta say as
someone who cares more about performance
and features then like dents in this I'm
actually pleased as punch that we're
getting a TV that's like you know what
all the brightness all the resolution
yeah I'm pretty excited to see the 3,000
minutes that'll be the brightest display
I've ever seen for sure unless you count
like those displays that like Vegas well
yeah okay so our power for the whole
beast comes in here and then all your
inputs including networking audio right
USB all this stuff over here is all
routed through this single cable along
with power up to the TV it's no secret
that I love it I've said that a lot of
times and I don't love it any less today
than I did before oh let's just turn it
on did you notice that the screen is
relatively matte oh yeah like it's not
that glossy apparently Samsung has like
the best anti reflective filters in the
business yeah because we have like
filming lights behind the TV and it's
actually shocking how little of it gets
reflected through like especially the
like there's an LED or a light that's
through that window if you sit where I
am you see it oh wow yeah and then like
look at how bright it is directly like
that is a shockingly small amount of
light reflected back at us
part of what Samsung has done that
special on this TV is they're using a VA
panel but one with a different
configuration so you don't get that same
color shift at an extreme angle so it's
kind of IPS like in that respect but it
also just has this really sharp VA like
contrast and then of course the the
matte screen that it's really good so
I've actually watched this clip
quite a few times as a like a demo clip
and it actually looks really good
bear you mind of course that this is
just for Kay's and just like the lines
and even like the hairs and stuff are
really good of course what we really
want to do is jump to 8k resolution so
let's fire up the Nvidia control panel
and see what happens because remember
this is an HDMI 2.0 connection so it's
not even showing up in the drop down
here we're gonna have to create
ourselves a custom res here oh it just
worked it just worked well that was easy
okay so let's have a look at this puppy
so this is a three hour 50 second clip
that's three minutes and 50 seconds and
it's nine big yeah the actual ones like
a hundred and five gigs so theoretically
this is basically as high definition as
it gets because this is shot on one of
our red 8k cameras and it's output at 8k
resolution now I will say the bitrate
could be higher because you can also see
some like pretty brutal artifacting info
that's brutal compression we can't try
like a red file if you want to but hey
that sounds pretty good Oh our poor
computer that's right I forgot about
that yeah we don't have ten giggle I
mean even ignoring that our poor CPU is
a hundred percent Wow Hey sure I guess
Wow look at this it looks like it's my
desktop background poor Windows just has
no idea what to do with this resolution
five hundred percent scaling Lee here's
our Start menu I wonder if the TV is
scaling it or something though
yeah Oh interesting
we are now on the latest driver so we're
gonna bump it to 4k yeah that's looking
pretty for ke we're gonna go color
Oh are there actual options now there
are yeah okay so maybe this will help
so hold on in 7680 by 4320 yeah test it
okay
does that look native nope okay but
that's fine because we're not in the
fourth input so go ahead and chuck it on
the fourth input and let's see if it
works this time
no signal okay all right
Netflix it is a shot like this with the
Penguins you can really appreciate the
finer detail and I will say compared to
the early days of 4k upsampling even
with the birds flying in different
directions here actually one of the
shots of the birds from the original
planet earth was like my classic yeah
why upscaling
shouldn't be a thing examples while
they're flapping you can see they're
handling it just way better it's almost
like TVs has undergone you know ten
generations of processing upgrades since
then okay so where we left off yesterday
we were having a pretty decent 4k to 8k
upsampled experience but we weren't able
to get true 8k working however yeah we
were talking to the guys at our kings
and we should be able to get real
full-blown Z's 8k on the go and 4k 1:20
really yeah
massive shout out to those guys however
apparently there's a bit of a process
won't you walk us through this so the
first thing we have to do is when we
plug in a device we have to go through
the setup wizard no skipping it correct
yeah otherwise whatever reason on input
for it just doesn't work so then you
need to do signal plus enable that cool
that this is something we're just not
gonna worry about that yeah let's just
proceed then yep okay
so then you need to do the custom
resolution utility and
hit reset all right but don't actually
use the custom resolution utility don't
try to do it in the Nvidia driver it's a
bad time
just this reset all feature then we go
to display settings advanced display
settings display it after properties
list all modes oh now we have all of
these guys here big old list in there
now that seems to work best if you do 8k
29 Hertz first yeah and hit apply
that looks pretty sure yeah so that's
really carry really okay well graduate
ready look it's pretty funky so then you
want to just go list all modes again and
go to 8k 30 okay whatever reason if you
go to that first sometimes the system
just stops working I don't know why but
it's a thing and there we go we have
full-blown Z's 8k 34 to 0
so you're not getting the full color
everything you're not getting the full
color depth you're not getting HDR but
for better or for worse you are driving
33 million pixels 30 times a second
through your display if you're into that
sort of thing and I have to say it looks
pretty damn good it looks really sharp
like that text is just like it's
something else for a display of this
size 4k is effective to about 3.8 feet
so that's about right here so aku can do
2 feet before you see pixels so that's
like here all right so this is it
this is our first 8k playback experience
on our 8k TV with 8k footage it's sharp
beautiful shot Brandon by the way okay
so just for fun before we play games can
I do what I had wanted to do before it
set to 100% okay thanks okay that's
pretty comical this is so ridiculous all
right look how much I have to move my
mouse just to get it across the screen
one two but it should still be sharp
damn and it is the system works okay so
why don't we do something different this
time we'll fire up so you skyline's yeah
this is like such a great example it's
like you can really make out the peep
walking around on the street oh yeah
from this vantage point like in that
park right there so next up is Forza so
dynamic render quality ultra 76 80 by
4320 that's a crazy number to look at
30fps all right let's see this it's
gonna benchmark like there's rain like
it looks like water droplets yeah like
it's pretty easily like the best
graphics I think I've ever seen the
sharpness is crazy like even without
anti-aliasing enabled you can see this
license plate is a perfect example
normally of the staircase effect as it
tilts back and forth but it's just
crystal clear and we actually managed
30fps hey now the actual frame times
there was definitely some stutter in
there so my friends are you going to be
gaming in triple-a titles with smooth
60fps experience at 8k anytime soon
probably not but is a K at a TV size an
absolutely eyeball poppin experience the
answer is definitely yes and sometime in
the next year or two you may even get a
chance to experience it once Samsung
sends out the upgraded boxes with HDMI
2.1 and japan broadcast the 2020
Olympics in a cane so there you go
that's the way forward for 8k so thanks
for watching guys thanks to Samsung for
sponsoring this video and letting us
have this very early look at the 8k
experience if you guys dislike this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed or
maybe consider checking out where to buy
the stuff we featured at the link in the
video description because let's face it
you are that person who wants to be the
first one with an 8k panel on the block
regardless of whether you could hook
anything up to it also linked in the
video description is our merch store
which has cool shorts like this one and
our community forum which you should
totally join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
