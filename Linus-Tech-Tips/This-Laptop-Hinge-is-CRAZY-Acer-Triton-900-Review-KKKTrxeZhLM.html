laptop thinking there's screams too far
oh I can't see you again
hey what if I told you a sir has a
solution that's pretty neat I guess but
it doesn't really answer the question of
who out there was asking for this
so we'll be spending the next few
minutes figuring out what makes this
laptop truly special speaking of special
my segways to sponsors like ourselves at
the LTTE store we've got hoodies water
bottles shirts and even cable ties in
fact our news LTT stealth hoodie just
came out and I think it looks freakin
awesome check out the link below to get
your new favorite shirt today
let's start by figuring out just who the
heck the Tritan 900 was made for my
first thought honestly game designers
it's a super powerful machine with a
party trick that's right up their alley
this surprisingly robust feeling hinged
screen gives you three positions to work
with all the way back all the way
forward and even check that out
a drawing position with the last one
being especially important since there
are two things that game designers need
somewhere to design you know like
ideally with a pen on a nice large
display and then somewhere to be able to
play their game making a roided-out
surface book look like the perfect
solution except for one small hiccup
even though this is a touchscreen when
we tried using various pens from Dell HP
Microsoft welcome and Samsung none of
them worked but just because the display
doesn't feature pen support doesn't mean
that it's bad we just need to take a
little deeper here and in fairness it's
not just not bad
this is one of the most crisp gaming
displays that we've ever feasted our
eyes on we're talking 4k resolution 400
nits peak brightness that's pretty darn
good for a mobile device a hundred
percent Adobe RGB colour space coverage
and support for HDR video playback
coupled with the improved ergonomics a
screen like this could make the Triton
900 a killer content consumption laptop
but we've got another problem I mean if
you want to buy a thirty-eight hundred
US dollar machine to watch YouTube
videos be my guest but it's probably not
the wisest move ever plus the speakers
which of course brings us to the most
obvious conclusion I mean it's part of
their predator lineup is the Triton 900
for gamers then packing an Nvidia r-tx
20/80 this thing chews through games I
mean you can expect to be able to run
basically anything at 4k 60fps even on
high details making it fantastic for
simulation games like City skylines or
an O 1800
as well as third person or sightseeing
games like The Witcher 3 or the Tomb
Raider series where you can like really
crank up the details because even if you
do dip a little bit below 60 FPS because
you turn to RTX on or whatever g-sync
is gonna step in and make sure that your
game still looks its best we even don't
mind it for streaming because while the
webcam isn't anything special at least
it has one unfortunately anything
without a high refresh rate display
feels like a compromise to us in 2019
especially for anything first-person and
especially for anything competitive and
the thing is there are lots of other
laptops on the market that can deliver
way more frames on their panels and that
still look really good for a lot less
the Zephyrus GX 701 is one that stands
out it's nearly as powerful as this
machine while and I never thought I'd be
saying these two things about this
Sepphoris being a lot easier to use as a
laptop and a lot cheaper alright then so
let's say maybe you only occasionally
game but you also need lots of power and
a really sharp display for other things
that I like I don't know number
crunching or 3d modeling well here the
Triton 900 really shines it sports up to
an 8 core core I $9.99 a thk that in our
case regularly turbo to up to four point
eight gigahertz and lighter loads and
maintain 3.6 gigahertz so well above
intel's advertised base clock in heavier
multi-threaded ones this actually puts
it on the podium with the fastest
laptops we've ever tested where it gets
beaten only by the Alienware area 51 M
which in fairness to Acer has a freaking
desktop CPU in it and this incredible
CPU power is augmented by excellent i/o
including three USB type-a ports a Type
C Thunderbolt 3 Gigabit Ethernet and two
full size display connectors one quick
aside one of the USB ports is inside
this little flippy outy thing that kind
of weirdest out at first and then we
were like oh wow you can hide your
wireless mouse dongle in there with
worrying about it getting broken or lost
sick of course features like hidden
compartments are normally found on
pretty bulky machines and this is no
exception
even ignoring its monstrous nine pound
weight the treyton 900 is hardly a lap
top in the traditional sense I mean we
understand that firmly it makes a lot of
sense to lay it out like this
you've got nice easy access to fresh air
for your fans but using this thing in
your lap is uncomfortable at best and as
for working away from the wall I mean
maybe the silver lining here is that you
won't have time to get uncomfortable
actually I lied about that last bit the
typing experience is pretty good overall
but only if you remember your wrist rest
otherwise it's a pretty bad time the
good news is that while acer is low
profile mechanical keyboard did take me
a little while to get used to once I did
I began to really like it aside from
some oddities the spacebar needs better
stabilisation this is unacceptable
and as for the right shift who puts that
here it takes so much mental effort on
this machine to type a question mark and
every single time I tried to use the
right shift at best I ended up with the
cursor up a line and at worst I'm an
entire page above where I intended to be
while I'm talking about things on the
lower right side of the laptop let's
address the touchpad now a lot of people
hate this layout but after using it more
it's actually not that bad this one
tracks well and I'm always surprised to
see how quickly I get used to track pads
in this location I only find it truly
annoying when I'm trying to go all the
way from one side of the screen to the
other while we're down here by the way
let's pry up the keyboard which gives us
access to the only upgradable components
on the Triton 900 the 2 m2 SSD slots and
the to sodium memory slots so not much
expansion here so then let's take stock
we've got a desktop replacement that's
not too upgradable but is damn powerful
out of the box
with a pretty good LBA kind of annoying
keyboard and an outstanding display have
we perhaps found the perfect machine for
our video editors it actually looks
great on paper but does this panel have
the color accuracy that they would
require well after testing it turns out
that while it manages over 99% of the
Adobe RGB color space which is great
when we look at the accuracy of the
colors within that space it's not
particularly amazing with an average
delta e of 4.2 and a max of 7.3 this
display yeah it's gonna look great to
the eye while you're gaming we really
felt that but it simply isn't good
enough for color critical work like
video or photo editing for those you're
generally looking for Delta ease of less
than 2 so this is where a sirs concept
the 9 starts to look really appealing
it's basically the same laptop but it
includes a Wacom digitizer for
professional level stylus support and
its color calibrated on the box so that
you can trust that what you see is what
others are going to see only problem is
the concept D is projected to be about a
thousand dollars more than the Triton
900 so if you don't need stylus support
and you want an incredible machine for
video editing or content creation on the
go we really like the Triton 900 just
make sure you grab a display calibrator
