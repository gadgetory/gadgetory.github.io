might seem confusing on the surface but
is actually well a little bit confusing
but very very cool this is the
impossible to open okay hold on
this is the OCZ synapse cache SSD so
this is not intended at all to be used
to install an operating system or any
software directly on this drive you're
not supposed to do that what you're
supposed to do with this 64 gig drive is
you are supposed to use it as a cache
for your hard drive and so you go okay
yeah yeah Intel SRT I've heard of that
before and I say no not until SRT this
SSD is not intended for use with Intel
SRT it is actually intended for use with
OC Z's data plex software so what data
Plex does is it is very well okay it's
very similar to how Intel SRT functions
in that it allows your OS to manage the
caching of data through an SSD rather
than just writing and reading everything
directly to and from the hard drive so
why would you use data plexes the
question because you could just buy a
Zen 68 motherboard and then you could
run SRT what if you don't have a Zen 68
motherboard what if you want to have an
ex 79 platform which by the way even
though it's the higher-end Intel chipset
does not support SRT well then you're
starting to look into a different
solution so something like data Plex so
why this SSD what's special about this
SSD and I'll tell you guys now the only
thing that's special about this SSD is
the durability so what else is he has
done is they've taken an SSD that is
actually a 128 gig SSD and they've run
and they've put 64 gigs
wait no hold on how does it work no
right they've taken a 64 gig SSD is
that's what's actually here in the
package and then they have over
provisioned half of the capacity of this
Drive
or we're leveling so what that means is
it appears to your operating system as a
32 gig drive if you ever actually plug
it in directly which you should never do
because it's a cache SSD but the reason
for that is that because of the limited
write cycles on these SSDs ocz has gone
ok well let's take half of the capacity
and let's swirl it away so that because
this is going to be used with a hard
drive and it's going to have things
caching in and out of it all the time
we're going to make sure that it's got
half of that capacity stored away so
that even if we have to write to it and
write to it and write to it constantly
we are going to keep the drive safe and
keep it functioning for a much longer
period of time so this is a SAN force
based SATA 3 drive but it uses a special
firmware to hide half of the capacity
and then it comes with a license so I'm
just gonna cover up the license key but
it's on there believe me it comes with a
license for the OCC data plex software
which installs on windows 7 so let me
just see if there's anything else that
I'm missing here right so what else is
included we've got one of those two and
a half inch to three and a half inch
adapters here we've got some mounting
screws if you wanted to put this in oh
oh CZ o CZ if you wanted to put it in a
notebook you could use these mounting
screws but you're probably oh no you
okay i guess you could use them to mount
this to that okay no no you couldn't
okay well this is not for a notebook
this is more for a desktop thing you've
got a little sticker here and you got oh
there's the DataFlex license key I'll
make sure I use that before I post this
unboxing so you're also going to want to
make sure that you stay tuned on my NCIX
comm channel because what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take this drive I'm gonna
run it with Intel SRT on a WD a black 2
terabyte hard drive as the boot drive
then I'm going to run it not using SRT
I'm going to use the DataFlex software
which by the way is supposedly I haven't
tried it yet much easier to install and
setup than Intel SRT and we're gonna see
which of those two caching solutions
learns faster and allows your system to
perform better so I'm very excited about
that
and thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the synapse cache drive from
