might seem confusing on the surface but
is actually well a little bit confusing
but very very cool this is the
impossible to open yeah okay hold on
this is the ocz synapse cache SSD so
this is not intended at all to be used
to install an operating system or any
software directly on this drive you're
not supposed to do that what you're
supposed to do with this 64 gig drive is
you are supposed to use it as a cash for
your hard drive and so you go okay yeah
yeah Intel SRT I've heard of that before
and I say no not until SRT this SSD is
not intended for use with Intel SRT it
is actually intended for use with OCC's
data plex software so what DataFlex does
is it is bit well okay it's very similar
to how Intel SRT functions in that it
allows your OS to manage the caching of
data through an SSD rather than just
writing and reading everything directly
to and from the hard drive so why would
you use data plexes the question because
you could just buy a Zen 68 motherboard
and then you could run SRT what if you
don't have a Zen 68 motherboard one if
you want to have an x 79 platform which
by the way even though it's the
higher-end intel chipset does not
support srt well then you're starting to
look into a different solution so
something like data plex so why this SSD
what's special about this SSD and i'll
tell you guys now the only thing that's
special about this SSD is the durability
so what else is he has done is they've
taken an SSD that is actually a 128 gig
SSD and they'd run and they've put 64
gigs wait no hold on how does it work no
right they've taken a 64 gig SSD is
that's what's actually here in the
package and then they have over
provisioned half of the capacity of this
Drive
or wear leveling so what that means is
it appears to your operating system as a
32 gig drive if you ever actually plug
it in directly which you should never do
because it's a cache SSD but the reason
for that is that because of the limited
write cycles on these SSDs ocz has gone
okay well let's take half of the
capacity and let's swirl it away so that
because this is going to be used with a
hard drive and it's going to have things
cashing in and out of it all the time
we're going to make sure that it's got
half of that capacity stored away so
that even if we have to write to it and
write to it and write to it constantly
we are going to keep the drive safe and
keep it functioning for a much longer
period of time so this is a San force
based se23 drive but it uses a special
firmware to hide half of the capacity
and then it comes with a licen so I'm
just going to cover up the license key
but it's on there believe me it comes
with a license for the ocz data Plex
software which installs on Windows 7 so
let me just see if there's anything else
that I'm missing here right so what else
is included we've got one of those two
and a half inch to three and a half inch
adapters here we've got some mounting
screws if you wanted to put this in Oh
ocz ocz if you wanted to put it in a
notebook you could use these mounting
screws but you're probably all know
you'd okay I guess you could use them to
mount this to that okay no no you
couldn't okay well this is not for a
notebook this is more for a desktop that
you've got a little sticker here and you
got it oh there's the DataFlex license
key i'll make sure i use that before I
post this unboxing so you're also going
to want to make sure that you stay tuned
on my lense eix comm channel because
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take this Drive I'm going to run it with
Intel SRT on a WD black2 terabyte hard
drive as the boot drive then I'm going
to run it not using SRT I'm going to use
the data plex software which by the way
is supposedly I haven't tried it yet
much easier to install and setup than
intel SRT and we're going to see which
of those two caching solutions learns
faster and allows your system to perform
better so I'm very excited about that
and thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the synapse cache dry for
