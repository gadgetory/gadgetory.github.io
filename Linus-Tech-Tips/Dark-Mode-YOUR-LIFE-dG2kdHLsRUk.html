like a dark-gray tidal wave with hints
of dark blue nowadays whether you're on
reddit Twitter YouTube or basically
anything else even our forum there's
probably some sort of option to change
the color scheme to match the black void
in your soul but is it really possible
to dark mode every aspect of your
digital life and why would you want to
we're gonna let you know right after I
tell you about memory Express memory
Express is Victoria BC location is now
open and it offers the same product
selection and quality of services there
are other stores check out the link
below to learn more
a huge reason that people use dark mode
is because they say that reading white
text on a dark background is easier on
the eyes and this is especially true at
night when the ambient light is low but
that subjective analysis actually goes
against a lot of the conventional wisdom
for years monitor manufacturers have
boasted of brighter and brighter
displays and according to both
traditional UI design guidelines and
studies that rate the readability of
various combinations of text and
background colors dark text on a white
background is still the number one most
readable configuration and indeed as
humans spend more and more of their time
staring at screens it has become
apparent that the conventional wisdom
isn't always the best thing for our eyes
scientists are now studying new
conditions like digital eye strain and
computer vision syndrome finding that
large amounts of time spent looking at
screens can contribute to sleeplessness
headaches dry eyes and blurred vision
and other studies have found that
reading black text on a white background
can even contribute to increase myopia
aka nearsightedness so then onto ways to
lessen the strain on your eyes now one
way is called night mode and this is
usually a setting on your monitor or on
your device that attempts to filter out
or reduce the blue light that your
screen is emitting making it less likely
to disrupt your circadian rhythm causing
you to unintentionally spend the whole
night going down a wikipedia black hole
but night mode is different from dark
mode dark mode is not a filter so much
as it's a color scheme or a theme that
can be applied either to a specific
application or in some cases even
system-wide so what this means is that
while it can improve comfort it doesn't
necessarily have the sleep benefits of
night mode and in brightly lit
environments it can actually strain your
eyes in
exactly the same way that a bright
screen can in a dark room also with dark
mode the implementation depends heavily
on the developer and not all dark modes
are made equal okay then so you're ready
to take the plunge and dark mode your
life let's start with Windows 10 Windows
has actually had theme support for a
very long time does anyone else remember
window blinds no anyway
now there's a handy option right in the
color settings to switch to the dark
default app mode this will make built-in
windows apps like settings calculator
and alarms almost fully black now it
might also automatically apply to photos
movies and groove music but if it
doesn't you can go into those app
settings and switch it on manually File
Explorer still doesn't have dark mode
support so you can expect sudden retina
searing light if you dare to browse see
but that is supposed to be coming in the
October update so Microsoft does still
have some work to do but if you don't
like the built-in dark mode they also
have the option for you to customize
Windows as high contrast settings to
basically create your own but even what
I said just now assuming it all goes
perfectly is only the built-in Microsoft
apps I mean who spends their whole day
using those what about the one app that
people probably use the most their web
browser
well edge and Firefox both have built in
dark themes and while there is no
official dark mode for Chrome the
browser's theme and extension support
mean that you can essentially kind of
tack one on so there's a category page
for dark themes in the Chrome Web Store
and popular ones include material
incognito dark and more fie on dark with
the former being our pick but a theme
just changes the toolbar websites are
still going to present themselves
normally so some more tweaking is
required now a lot of websites have
built in dark modes including Twitter
YouTube reddit the line is tech tips
forum and Gmail's inbox actually
although here
for that last one daring to actually
open an email will still blind you as
for the rest of the web you can install
the dark reader extension which is also
available for Firefox and Safari on Mac
OS it analyzes colors and tries to make
webpages look like an official dark mode
with some settings available for
customization as well it solves Gmail's
dark mode problem but it can also cause
some glitchyness and delayed loading at
times thankfully you can actually teach
it to enable or disable itself
automatically site by site now on to
another popular app Microsoft Office
there is an official dark mode or dark
theme found in the settings but it sucks
it doesn't affect the actual page color
you will have to go to design bank page
color for that and if you dare to make
comments add markups to a page or try to
highlight anything you will quickly
discover some of its many flaws if
you're a Mac OS user
well you no doubt already know about
Mojave is dark mode it's got a number of
customization options and it affects all
of the OSS built in apps then for
everything else the Handy website dark
mode list has a directory of a ton of
Mac OS apps that support dark mode also
if you install a third-party app like
night owl or shifty you can customize
and even automate dark modes to turn on
and off depending on the time of day iOS
is where things start to get really
interesting though so Apple added a
feature in the iOS accessibility
settings called Smart invert colors
which does exactly what it sounds like
it inverts the colors in every app but
it also analyzes the screen to skip over
stuff like icons and images the result
is something that's actually pretty dang
close to a true system-wide dark mode
although you might not like the way that
it makes some apps look like Google Maps
fortunately Apple thought of that and
you can assign the mode to turn on or
off when you triple click the power
button pretty awesome
what is not quite as awesome is androids
implementation of dark mode now Google
finally added a dark mode option but it
only a
quick settings the app drawer and maybe
the contacts and phone app notifications
and the full Settings app remain light
which is pretty irritating you can
change individual apps to dark mode
phone messages YouTube news maps that is
in navigation mode Google Play games
Authenticator G board and the Google
discover feed but your mileage may vary
that is still not working on Riley's
pixel now Android does have an invert
colors option but it literally just
inverts the colors with no
post-processing to preserve images so it
really sucks
there is the substratum engine an app
that enables more robust theming support
but it requires that you root your
device on all versions of Android except
Oreo so obviously there are some
trade-offs with dark mode not the least
of which being that from a UI design
standpoint it is more difficult to make
it look good and there's still work to
be done to the point where I could see
people just opting not to bother if it's
gonna be this much of a hassle but aside
from everything we've talked about so
far with respect to improved comfort
there are some other benefits as well so
for example if you're on a mobile device
you could actually realize measurable
battery savings at their Android dev
summit Google said that using dark mode
in the YouTube app on an OLED screen
could reduce your battery usage by as
much as 40% though it should be noted
that this was at maximum brightness oh
right I guess Riley didn't write an
outro for this I guess that wasn't the
maximum brightest idea ha ha ha oh yeah
it's a good thing I have a writing staff
speaking of staff if you wield your
staff in RPG games and also stream them
online you might want to pick up an
elgato stream deck it allows you to
concentrate on your stream instead of
trying to memorize keyboard shortcuts
OneTouch operations allow you to start
your stream announce your live play
animations and more without ever taking
your eyes off the action with a total of
6 LCD keys that can be customized for
any action
and have the graphics on them changed
cuz they're all little screens it's not
just for streamers I mean Taron actually
has two of the stream decks at his desk
because he loves his macros for Adobe
Premiere it's not hard to remember which
key does what because there are little
screens it's available for Mac or
Windows it's less than 100 US dollars
and you can check it out now at Amazon a
new egg at the link below so thanks for
watching guys if you dislike this video
you can hit that button but if you liked
it hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description also down there's our
merch store which has been recently
overhauled go check it out has shirts
like this one and our community forum
which you should totally join and then
enable dark mode on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
