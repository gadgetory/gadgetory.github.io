gets it right July 2002 the episode
child abduction is not funny aired and
the parents went far beyond the kid
leash and equipped their children with
GPS tracking devices yeah we well here
we are 15 years later and the snow Fox
family tracker from Hal Shin products
might not be as cool looking but it is a
real thing
I backed it on IndieGoGo about six
months ago half out of curiosity and
half out of a genuine intention to use
it but is it a useful child tracking
tool should we clip GPS tags to our
children's ears these are some great
questions
HP's new omen X lineup comes equipped
with Intel 7th generation Core i7
processor check it out at the link in
the video description so let's start
then with how the snow fox works they
market it as a solution to help you keep
tabs on kids or seniors that you
otherwise might lose the device itself
is pretty simple on the back you'll find
a micro B USB charging port with a
weather resistant rubber flap the snow
fox is IP 54 rated so dust and splash
resistant but don't expect to go
swimming with it along the edges are an
attachment point for a wrist strap and a
little tag that you should not remove
since it contains the devices wireless
antenna it connects to a compatible 3G
network for voice calling so make sure
you order the right model for your
country on the front is everything your
kid or nan is expected to use a
microphone a speaker and a single button
surrounded by an RGB LED ring that
flashes according to what's going on
other than flashing green for an
incoming call there's really not much to
it
ok so let's set it up the first month of
wireless services included and there
isn't even a SIM slot so your
subscription is handled through Houchin
the process of adding it to the app is
easy provided you don't misplace the QR
code sticker on your manual and provided
you managed to figure out that instead
of manually clicking the next field you
have to press next both the iOS and
Android apps are a little buggy so I
finally did get my registration working
then you name your snow fox attach it to
something you love and hope for the best
from inside the app you can see the
real-time locations with the option to
call navigate to if Google Maps or some
other service if you prefer or share the
location of one or multiple snow foxes
along with the last 20 GPS coordinates
with Family Circus esque lines drawn
between them with an activity history
that lists out location
along with a call and notification
history to make this report more
detailed you can set up places such as
home school and Chuck's house though as
with any GPS device the accuracy is
probably only useful to within about a
city block so don't expect to know if
little Sally is in the kitchen or the
living room these zones can be
configured with some special properties
like silencing the phone ringer at
school or sending a push alert to all
the shared guardians in the app if they
go over to that bad influence kids house
the way it works from my son's
perspective is he can press the button
once to tell me he's thinking of me ok I
wish that could be configured to just
let him call me or he can hold it for
three seconds to notify all of the
Guardians that he wants someone to call
him voice quality is what I would
describe as good enough though only
being able to use it as a speakerphone
is a bit of a drag and the apps Guardian
invitation system is bugged right now
and it keeps asking me to enter my
wife's phone number and international
format when there's no way to do that on
North American versions of iOS or
Android as far as I can tell though I'm
sure they'll get that sorted you'll end
up charging the snow Fox about once a
week as long as you don't spend too much
time chatting on it and it can only be
turned off by the Guardian app so there
you have it then for the price of only
about 10 euros a month plus 150 euro
upfront cost which does seem a little
unreasonable given it doesn't even have
a screen the technology to track your
loved ones Weasley family style is here
with the only real question being should
we be doing this and as a parent I'm
pretty torn to be honest on the one hand
privacy advocates everywhere are
probably queuing up to crucify me in the
video comments for even considering this
but on the other hand in the event that
something did go wrong I'd be devastated
to feel that all I had to do was pay 10
bucks a month to clip something to my
son to ensure that I could find him
since especially today with this
technology only just starting to appear
the odds of a would-be child mapper
realizing the cute little toy that he
wears is a GPS tracking device does seem
pretty slim but if I can't trust my kids
and if they don't learn to function in
the real world how will they survive as
adults and just because I intend to use
this device responsibly doesn't mean
every parent would should it exist for
me if someone else would use it in an
abusive manner and where is this
technology going will tagging and
tracking our children be as routine is
giving them a measles and mumps vaccine
by the time I'm a grandpa how will I
feel about that so in the end by
attempting to write out my answer to the
original question I've ended up more
confused than I was when I started and
maybe that's the first step to
understanding any new technological
advance and maybe step number two is
discussion I want to hear your thoughts
in the comments below what do you think
of the snow fox tracker you know what
else I'd love to hear your thoughts on
