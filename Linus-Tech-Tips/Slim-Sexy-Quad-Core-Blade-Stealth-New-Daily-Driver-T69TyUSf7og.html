battery life eight gigs of ram with no
option to upgrade and dual-core
processor made it neither a serious
productivity device for road warriors
nor a legitimately capable gaming
machine like its thicker and less
stealthy 14-inch cousin even with an
outboard graphics card but that's all
different now literally all of it the
blade stealth late 2017 stops all over
its predecessors so let's take a look at
it
World of Tanks is the free-to-play
online game that throws players into
epic tank battles across different
battlefields and we've got a special
deal for you guys below and more info
coming later in the video
externally the 13.3 inch blade stealth
pretty much hasn't changed in the last
couple of years and that's a good thing
because you might disagree but I think
the industrial design is damn near
perfect the top is classic razor with an
illuminated logo and armored accent
bumps the bottom is lifted a little
higher at the back on rubber feet for a
slight angle to the keyboard and to give
the single intake fan access to fresh
air and the side profile is pretty much
as thin as it could be while still
allowing razor to cram in what is fairly
generous IO for a thin and light these
days two full-size USB 3 ports HDMI 2.0
and audio jack and a Type C Thunderbolt
3 port that also charges the device and
the whole thing has a sturdiness to it
that's been very refreshing compared to
the Graham that I've been using since
early this year it is heavier yes and
the battery life is much worse unless
you're willing to cart around an extra
battery bank with you but in power
saving mode it still comfortably lasts
me over five hours of actual use and I
also expect it to hold up to the rigors
of my grueling travel schedule a little
bit better than the Graham has flipping
it open then there's still not much to
dislike it's 2017 the bezels could be a
little bit thinner and the power button
is still really mushy for our company
whose first product was a mouse but the
3200 by 1800 100% srgb display while not
shockingly bright is a solid performer
and includes a touchscreen something
that I rarely notice myself using but
that drives me crazy when I'm on
something that doesn't have one and the
keyboard speakers and trackpad are
somewhere between very good and
excellent for a device of this class
with the keyboard in particular standing
out to me because it blows me away that
the same
company that put such an excellent low
profile keyboard on a thin and light put
such an abomination on their desktop
replacement 17-inch model
let's talk gaming the stealth is not
really for gaming but thanks to some
under the hood upgrades there are a lot
of ways to game on it emulators older
triple-a titles and modern eSports
titles like rocket League and Gotha 2
will run directly off the onboard Intel
graphics at usable frame rates as long
as you lower the resolution the onboard
killer Wireless consistently saw
transfer speeds of 40 megabytes per
second or more on a high-end AC access
point so if you have a gaming PC
elsewhere in the house steam in-home
streaming works at very high quality
settings fantastically or you could even
use it remotely with software like
parsec on a fast low latency internet
connection and with the addition of an
external GPU the blade stealth
transforms from Ultrabook to ultra
high-end gaming system I was floored
when I saw the CPU turbo boosting to
those clock speeds in games I mean yes
we're still giving up some fps compared
to a desktop running that same Titan X P
graphics card with a high-end quad core
or 6 core desktop chip and Thunderbolt
protocol overhead and narrower PCIe 4x
connection aren't helping matters but
these are still really impressive
results and sorry raising both the
performance bottlenecking and the price
gap actually close significantly if
you're willing to explore third-party eg
pew enclosures that forego some of the
core v2s creature comforts like easy
upgrade ability and built-in Ethernet
and thanks to these 16 gigs of soldered
ram I found it useful for more than just
gaming even with just the onboard
graphics for our editing and rendering
simple videos intel's eighth generation
u series processors put their previous
generation efforts to shay
I would still equip a skilled video
editor with something that can run
higher than about 2.2 gigahertz with all
the course land but throwing together
this video in Premiere in the backseat
of my car
on the way to visit my grandparents was
very doable on the blade stealth it's
still a blade so it was sitting between
10 to 15% CPU usage thanks Chrome while
I was typing up this review and it was a
little warm to the touch but it stays
really quiet even under full load now we
need to talk about money gone is the
starting at $9.99 pricing that made the
original blade stealth so attractive but
while it is pricier than that it's still
in line with or better than devices of
similar spec and build quality like
Dells XPS 13 so that's not something
that I'm gonna give razor too much flak
about I will save my flak for the
battery it is the worst thing about this
device but as I said before it's still
very usable so I think of the blade
stealth as kind of like a sporty
two-seater the fuel economy sucks
compared to something more practical
like the ground but it's got other
things going for it and I really really
like it and I will be switching to the
blade stealth full-time wargaming is
sponsoring this video to tell you guys
to go check out World of Tanks
it's the free-to-play online game that
if you've been living under a rock for
the last few years you might not have
heard of but it's all about breathtaking
tank battles across epic battlefields it
said in the mid 20th century and World
of Tanks gives you access to an
impressive roster of over 450 authentic
tanks from steel brawlers to light and
fast Scouts and there are RPG elements
to the game where you can research
upgrades and modifications to enhance
your tanks performance on the
battlefield for new players they're
recommending to try out the Ru is-3 a
close-range brawler or the US t29 which
has a powerful turret and quick
maneuverability and you can join over a
hundred and fifty million players
worldwide and they can name for yourself
on the battlefield they're offering you
guys three days of premium time 500 gold
and a premium tank by using code WWII
tanks and this is for new players only
and you'll find that at the link in the
video description so thanks for watching
