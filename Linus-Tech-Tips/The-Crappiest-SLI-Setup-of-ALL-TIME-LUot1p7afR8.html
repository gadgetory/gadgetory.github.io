probably think of grande gaming machines
that can rush anything like urban gtx
280 TI sli for titans but what about the
other end of the spectrum just how bad
can an SLI gaming machine be well once
again Linus tech tips is bringing you
the answer to a burning question that
nobody asked
cooller masters 25th anniversary edition
cosmos 2 features a unique dual curved
tempered glass side panel check it out
now at the link below so it all started
while we were working on cheapest Newegg
PC and we stumbled across something
astonishing hey our graphics card
supports sli and we've got two of them
so of course we immediately set out to
build what would end up being the
cheapest and almost the worst SLI rig
possible but the reason that we bought
two of those GeForce 8400 Gs cards was
actually in case one of them broke and
it's always a good plan when we're
ordering super cheap and old stuff for
videos on a deadline and sure enough
while attempting to test SLI one of them
broke almost immediately but honestly
they weren't actually the worst SLI
capable cards that Nvidia ever made and
if we were going to have to buy more
cards anyway we felt like we should
really go for the worst of the worst
I mean effectively we were aware that
there wouldn't be much difference
between a turd burger and nail clipping
soup and nail clipping soup but here at
Linus tech tips we only accept the best
of the best or the worst of the worst so
I present to you hailing from the Year
2006 the NVIDIA GeForce 7100 GS the
worst Nvidia graphics card to ever
feature support for SLI these things are
so fricking worthless that it's hard to
find one of them let alone two I mean on
eBay there were a couple available but
no matching pairs and that's ignoring
completely unreasonable shipping costs
even our industry contacts like EVGA and
a soos didn't bother holding on to any
of these so they had nothing kicking
around
because why would they fortunately
though we have awesome fans and after a
Twitter post Matt and Archer Grimes
hooked us up with these beautiful
specimens thanks guys
so the GeForce 7100 then a card that was
basically a rebrand of the worst card on
the market from the year 2000 for the
GeForce 6200 but now with SLI so with a
whopping 20 watt power draw a blistering
350 megahertz core clock and 300
megahertz memory clock these things are
only out computed by the most
experienced abacus users hailed in their
time as only acceptable for office use
and anything but sensible we're
expecting running these cards in games
to be about like taking your dad's lawn
mower to LeMans and you've got to put
smoke so we toss them in our system and
huh where's the set SLI configuration
option I mean it says so on the webpage
SLI maybe it's Windows 10 screwing with
our drivers but in Windows 7 it doesn't
work either documentation for running
these guys in SLI is basically a couple
of jokes about it on Tech forums from 10
years ago and then one German review
website that did get it to work so there
was still hope after some more digging
we found out that only x58 boards and
older will work with the SLI drivers so
rock on then x it oh crap
then while installing the board on our
bench one of the capacitors literally
fell off its leads so after stealing a
similar enough one off of another dead
motherboard and soldering it on we were
back in business maybe it still wouldn't
work after some more digging it turns
out that maybe only 32-bit versions of
Windows will support this old of SLI
making the 48 gigs of ram in our system
look a little in Bund unnecessary but we
decided to leave it all in there anyway
because it looks cool in the end almost
hash tag out of ideas we blew the dust
off of our CD drive burned ourselves a
copy of Windows XP 32-bit and spent
about a morning in driver compatibility
hell until finally yes finally we had
the pinnacle of piss-poor PC performance
so first we tried out some games using
one of the 70 100's to set a baseline
where it performed about as well as
you'd expect one-and-a-half FPS from
3dmark 2006 like 10 in crisis and
actually a pretty good experience in
halo combat Evolved and well over 60
frames per second in 3d mark 2001 se so
we were hopeful about its performance
with sli enabled until well everything
crashed almost immediately 3d mark 2001
2006 halo crisis and half-life 2 the sli
performance of this machine completely
exceeded our expectations for how crap
it would be truly the definition of
unplayable the only 3d object that
wouldn't crash the computer immediately
was the 3d text screensaver and even
that had stuttering issues and we aren't
talking soft crashes here you open a
game food and you'll be reaching for the
reset switch we tried a bunch of
different drivers from 91 point 4 5 all
the way up to 307 since we wanted at
least one game to work so we could
compare performance and they all
immediately died with SLI enabled so you
might be asking yourself then why bother
releasing this video at all well I guess
it's because we learned some things
along the way that we felt were
important to pass along one driver
support for eleven-year-old graphics
cards isn't great number two
Windows XP isn't as good as we all
remember it being number three
capacitors can fall off old motherboards
pretty easily then can be fixed pretty
easily and finally four holy sweet
spitballs whatever you do don't run the
70 100 GS in SLI you're welcome King is
the mobile carrier that is focused on
customer service and customer
satisfaction first you don't speak to a
robot when you call customer service at
ting you get put through directly to a
person and somehow they manage that with
an average King bill for their customers
out there of only 23 bucks a month per
device because ting is all about the
concept of paying for only what you use
so this is cool you go on to their
website we've got a link below - ENCOM
and you try out the savings calculator
you enter your last few bills with your
current carrier and how much data and
talktime you used and it spits out
whether you would save money on ting and
if you would save money on ting they
will actually cover 25 percent of your
cancellation fee out of your existing
contract up to $75 and if you use our
link down below you'll also get 25 bucks
in service credits or towards a new
device so go try it out that's linus
kang comm so thanks for watching guys if
you just like this video you can hit
that button but if you liked it hit the
like button get subscribed maybe
consider checking out where to buy a new
graphics card in the video description
also down there is our merch store where
you can buy cool shirts like this one
and our community forum which you should
