Chinese GoPro wannabe makes these
unbelievable claims about great full HD
or even 4k video recording for 60 bucks
or whatever but every single one of them
that I have ever touched has been
obviously converting the data from some
horrendous 640 by 480 sensor if you're
lucky not to mention that many of them
have a completely unusable UI so to call
my expectations going into this review
of the Yi action camera too low would be
very generous so then to say that I was
blown away would be an understatement
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours through the link
in the video description let's start
with the basics I've got the selfie
stick kit which includes the Yi 2 camera
as I'll be referring to it for the rest
of the video a battery a kind of cheap
feeling clip on plastic shutter button
and a surprisingly robust selfie stick
with a locking telescopic well I guess
it's a stick terminated with a
quarter-inch threaded post and a
smartphone holder bracket that screws on
to the one side down here at the bottom
it's not perfect by reversing the gender
of the threading or including an adapter
it could have been used to put a phone
at the end of the stick when you are not
using the Yi 2 and the top swivel could
be a bit more flexible which would both
be welcome improvements to its general
usefulness but I can't fault the selfie
sticks build quality overall which
brings us to the camera itself it's
pretty plastic II feeling another dollar
or two would inspire more confidence in
this product but hey as long as she's
got it where it counts right at the
bottom is the battery and micro SDXC
compartment along with the female
quarter-inch mount at the front is the F
2.8 7-element 155 degree wide angle lens
covering a sony IMX 377 twelve point
three five megapixel affective CMOS
image sensor capable of 4k video or 12
megapixel stills along with a status
indicator light on the side is a micro
USB charging port on the top are the
dual microphone ports and a speaker
grille wait a minute
why would it need a speaker ah yes
because on the back the entire back of
the unit is taken up by 640 by 360 pixel
wide format touchscreen and if you've
ever had a major video project riding on
correctly framing a shot with a gopro
hero4 black you will surely appreciate
this inclusion and the implementation
isn't half-assed either the viewfinder
is butter smooth and so
was the menu navigation so whether
you're changing settings or reviewing a
clip you just shot all of which is
doable over Wi-Fi with the GoPro app by
the way eliminating this step especially
with a multicam setup where things can
get jostled mid shoot like we frequently
find ourselves in a lot of time and
guesswork can be saved and the u2
actually supports changing all those
settings and previewing your shot live
through they're mostly stable app on
your phone if you prefer that approach
as well though none of that would be
valuable if the shots from your
perfectly positioned camera looked like
trash would it so let's have a look at
some 4k 30fps footage first compared to
the only camera from GoPros lineup that
also shoots at that resolution the hero4
black so overall whether we're talking
about low-light performance auto white
balance scene brightness change response
or really anything else I was really
impressed by this little camera and
that's without having access to some of
the modes that only work at lower
resolutions the sixaxis electronic image
stabilization that only works if you're
shooting at resolutions below 4k and no
higher than 60 frames per second is
freaking cool and probably worth it for
some people to drop all the way down to
1080p in order to take advantage of it
though on that subject I really wish
that 2560 by 1440 was a shooting option
since it would be a balance between
having some sensor left to enable
anti-shake and also having the ability
to crop and punch in your footage though
I'm not going to deduct too many marks
for this given how impressive this
camera is at half of what we paid for
the action cams that we use for most of
our projects with the biggest shocker
yet to come the battery life we are used
to taking a caseload of replacement
batteries on any GoPro shoot and
switching over to a fleet of Yi 2's
would cut in half the frequency with
which we need to replace them with sound
quality being yet another strong point I
mean sure it's not perfect it's not as
good as a lav my
or a boom like but when you're speaking
directly into the camera from selfie
distance even with a fair amount of
background noise it's a fast and easy
way to get surprisingly usable audio so
I'm in China
courtesy of ZTE ZTE can ever keep track
of what the Canadian way is check out
this hotel room alright press conference
is over it's time to join back up with
Brendon series out on b-roll for the gap
camera with the camera as long as you're
not using the waterproof case though
I've yet to find any action cam that has
really solved that problem
on that note they're 40 metre
polycarbonate and glass waterproof
housing is not included with the kit we
got but while I don't have pricing for
it yet based on the last generation ye
camera it should land in the ten to
thirty dollar range it doesn't allow the
use of the touchscreen obviously but the
top button lets you do all of the
essentials power start/stop record and
power off and this is great it uses a
GoPro compatible mounting system which I
guess leads us right into the usual
issue with any action cam that isn't a
GoPro the relatively immature accessory
ecosystem now some stuff that's not
available for the u2 can be ignored the
waterproof case accessory makes it
compatible with many GoPro mounts
including head chest and even scuba suit
etc but the first party one anyway
lacks a more acoustically friendly
backing for audio recording while using
those GoPro accessories and I also don't
see an obvious solution for non mounting
related accessories like external
battery chargers nothing seems to be
available at this time meaning that you
will need to charge your batteries in
your camera just fine for casual users
but pros are going to want something a
little bit beefier so they can charge
more of them at a time however if that
drawback in your mind is easily overcome
by the price the screen the footage
quality and that quarter-inch mount I
won't entirely disagree with you of
course it remains to be seen if GoPro
will come storming back
with the hero five lineup later this
year in the meantime though I'll be
watching the u2 very very closely Tunnel
bear is the simple VPN app that makes it
easy to browse the web privately and
enjoy well a more open Internet and the
best part about it is that it is easy to
use and free for your first 500 Meg's of
data but what does it do exactly well
when you hit the button that turns
tunnel bear on two things happen number
one is that your connection gets
encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
and number two is that based on whatever
you selected in a drop-down up to 20
different countries you will appear to
the websites and web services that you
use as though you are browsing from that
other country so you could be from the
UK or America or whatever the case may
be now if you try out tunnel bear we've
got a link in the video description that
is tunnel bear comm /l TT and you go wow
gee this is really great you can
actually save 10% on an unlimited plan
by using that link so again that's
tunnel bear comm /l tt so thanks for
