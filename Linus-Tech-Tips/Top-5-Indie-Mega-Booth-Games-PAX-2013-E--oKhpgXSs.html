brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries hey guys I hope you
enjoyed our indie mega booth content and
we're going to go through a top five in
no particular order of what the games i
liked within the indie mega booth to
start us off first and foremost i'm
going to go with life goes on this is
what looks like at first glance a
traditional platformer game but is not
in traditional platformers you really
try not to die and you're dodging things
all the time in this game you
specifically try to die because that is
required to progress through the game
and then we come up on as says this is a
game that starts with some strategy and
building and city building and all that
kind of stuff but then when someone
comes and messes with your city you go
out go down into a side view side
scroller where you just beat the tar out
of people and smash their blood out
literally it's a grayscale
black-and-white game that has red for
blood it's really noticeable it's an
awesome game about the Aztecs galaxy
made this list because of awesome
mechanics it is really interesting to
play out you can boost around the
agility that you have in your little
spaceship is great it reminded me a lot
about asteroids but it's more asteroids
coming to this day and age which is
great to see they made tons of
innovation and looks like a lot of fun
and then we come along that dragon
cancer this game wasn't like anything
else on the floor because most of the
games on the floor work citing an action
packed in la blah but this game was a
lot more somber and slower but deeper as
you're going through the game the art
style and the sound and being able to
hear his voice speaking as himself and
as his thoughts was was really
interesting and brought you into the
story because the one of the main kicked
all the characters in the story are his
family the the designers family so it's
it's interesting being that close to the
actual story and last but not least as
this is an unordered list we get to
necro this game reminded me a lot as i
said in the original video of a mission
in Warcraft 3 where your Arthas and you
turn sides and you kind of rush back at
the innocent people with your army of
minions that is what this whole game is
about you're an evil dude if a whole
bunch of undead and you just reckon face
