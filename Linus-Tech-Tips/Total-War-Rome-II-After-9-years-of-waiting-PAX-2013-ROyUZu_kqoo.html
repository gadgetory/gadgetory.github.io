brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries silver here with Al
Beckham studio communications manager at
Creative Assembly and that they're
finally showing off rome total war two
why did you make rome total war 2 I mean
there's so many other things you guys
could have done you could have done like
you know ants total war or like you know
robots total or aliens total war why are
you revisiting Rome now you said I wish
think we done robot so he looks that
sounds brilliant no so so the time is
right really it's a it's a period we've
always wanted to revisit the technology
we have now you know the war scape
engine is developed it's quite
significantly you know the original
drone was like nine years ago now so the
technology we have now we could just do
we can do that period greater justice we
can look at things in greater detail we
can deal with greater scale and then we
could just do a better job of it now and
it's something we've always wanted to
return to but also it's something that
our fan base is always want to return to
as well so you know total war players
for the last five plus years have kind
of been going oh I hope it's Rome 2 next
they hope is ro 2 next so it's I think
the time is right to do it so you talk
about being able to do it better justice
I mean you know that the battlefield
battles themselves the mechanics of them
they weren't fundamentally broken in in
rome total war in any way so what is it
that the better technology allows you to
really do differently how is it grander
and better and so you know in terms of
in terms of the graphics technology and
the processing technology we have
available to us now it we can we can
just represent that world in in greater
fidelity in greater detail and and with
a greater sense of atmosphere as well I
mean if you tries if you try playing
battles in different parts of the world
in Rome to you'll get this real sense of
location you know we've got greater
elevation in the landscape we've got you
know very very different lighting models
for different parts of the world very
very different weather systems and and
this just creates a greater sense of
atmosphere you know
and I think you know as well as well as
the greater technologies the growth of
the studio and you know in terms of the
talents that we have in in-house just
means you know we can we could just do
things better we could do more of it you
know the the music that we in the game
you know is is is we've recorded it with
a with a complete Symphony Orchestra and
you can really hear the difference you
know back in Rome where it was kind of
MIDI it was all computer made music
really so you know now we've got this
tremendous sweeping orchestral score and
we've we've we've you know we've sort of
suffused that with ethnic musicians and
you've come in and played these ancient
instruments for us and they they whether
you've when you're aware of what the
instrument even is when you hear it you
kind of go yeah that sounds really Greek
oh that sounds really kind of Africa you
know so you know Rome was a melting pot
of cultures and you know so we want to
reflect that as well in the you know in
the music and the atmosphere of the game
so so yeah it's a labels us to do so so
yeah so one of the big problems were
thought and not just rome total war but
you look back at any of the games that
are well older at this point you know
like earlier civilization games or
whatever else a huge part of that game
needs to be diplomacy but yet there was
so little insight into how the AI worked
and the AI was just seemed very
two-dimensional back back in that era
what did you guys done this time around
so there's two real key changes to
diplomacy because excuse me so when
you're dealing with AI factions on the
campaign map you know you want to make
alliances or you know declare war and
all that kind of stuff
so this is you know there's this idea of
transparency into the AIS
decision-making process something we've
already tackled head-on with Rome too so
we have a new part of the UI which gives
it shows you a list of all your past
actions by which that particular faction
is judging you right so if you've
conducted wars against his friends he
will like you less and you know we've
got plus and minus points you know we
give you a kind of balanced rating of of
how how how much that AI really likes
you and therefore how likely is
you know ii wanna conduct constructive
diplomacy with you rather than say
attack you and you know i think we've
all been in a situation a total war game
in the past where we're an AI faction
has attacked us and we don't really know
why and now now we can show you that you
know there's usually in the past there's
usually been a reason for it i mean part
of it is of course some a eyes are more
aggressive than others and will want to
attack other factions to conquer their
lands because they are a warlike nation
you know so but part of it also is that
you know you've you've gone out into the
world and you've made an impact and
that's made some people happy and some
people unhappy right now we show you why
so so yeah i mean you know i think i
think people find it a lot more natural
a lot more intuitive and you know a lot
more enjoyable to play with so you've
got a bunch of gaming stations it looks
like about ten stations back here and
this has been absolutely full every
single station the entire show what are
they doing back there what game mode is
it and how are people enjoying it so
we've got to the historical battles and
from the game we've got the Battle of
the Nile which is a giant combined land
and sea battle where we've got we get to
play at navies with troops on and
artillery weapons so they could go to
enable come you know battle with the
Egyptian fleet or they can disembark
their troops onto the land to support
the main attack which is your Roman army
heading up the hill to try and conquer
the the army of Ptolemy the thirteenth
so you know it's a it's a kind of
classic historical battle from history
but it's it's a real mixture of loads of
the kind of new elements that we've got
in battles in Rome too and and of course
it's a lovely great big giant scale
battle as well which is really good fun
and the other battle at which we've got
playable here is the battle Teutoburg
forest which is which was a it was the
battle there was a nine ad was the
battle that that proved to the Romans
that they were the masters of all
warfare Rome got his nose bloody really
badly it lost three legions in the most
carefully orchestrated ambush and was
betrayed no is portrayed by one of its
own officers you know the guy called
Arminius betrayed
his his own side because he was German
by descent and in Germania he he said he
saw how his his kinsmen his old kinsmen
had been treated by the Roman settlers
the Roman invaders you know that by the
you know by the local forces so he
rallied the Germanic barbarians ribes
into an effective fighting force so
we've been giving out prizes from people
who who beat it on normal and we've had
I think seven or eight people over the
course of the show beat it on normal and
we've probably had more than 1500 people
playing it so you know it's like you can
play on easy it's a lot easier obviously
on normal it's tough on hard it's very
very very hard so it's one of those cool
battles that you can just play and then
you can go ah okay okay I'm going to try
that again a different way rearrange
your force at the start to defend from
the rear maybe and move your stuff
forward and maybe I'll try that so it's
a good kind of repeat play battle not
really nice challenge basically so I
both these battles show off you know our
new battle engine the the huge Villa
della T and the soldiers we've got in
the game and and that that's sort of
that as I mentioned that sense of
atmosphere and that sense of debt
greater elevation which creates a kind
of visual dynamism you know this is this
is an aspect of both these battles so
alright well that sounds extremely
exciting thank you very much for taking
the time guys don't forget our coverage
here at the show is powered by Western
Digital Intel and steel series so huge
thanks to those guys for allowing us to
be here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
