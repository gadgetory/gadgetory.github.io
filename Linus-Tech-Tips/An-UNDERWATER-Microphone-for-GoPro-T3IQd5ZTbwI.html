building an underwater microphone for
the GoPro Hero 4 I nearly lost my shirt
are you freaking serious you mean all
the recordings of me screaming like a
whiny hairless infant can continue after
I hit the water
what does high-quality submarine audio
even sound like dreams of dialogues with
dolphins danced in my dome all around we
finally got one
but at $200 does it offer enough under
the sea adventure to whet your appetite
let's dive in
HP's new omen ex lineup comes equipped
with Intel seventh generation Core i7
processor check it out at the link in
the video description excited about
owning a piece of history I ripped open
this technological breakthrough Vox
liberating the high quality foam that
encapsulated the device and I'd be lying
if I said my audiophile parts weren't
tingling a little bit
the most obvious physical characteristic
of the mk2 Elements is the dead cat
style windscreen so clearly then this
thing isn't just made for underwater use
and if you're just dying to touch it at
this point you're not the only one it
ended up though being a little less
fuzzy and a little more prickly than I
expected turns out that's because much
like me it's meant to be rugged
resistant to dust mud and snow when used
above the water's surface the microphone
mounts to a shell that will soon become
the back half of your GoPros waterproof
housing snap it on to the hinge of the
stock front piece then this little cable
managed wire and this tiny PCB are
responsible for connecting the mic to
your hero force mini-b USB port they can
safely be removed later by the way using
this tab you then tuck the whole thing
discreetly into the backplate and bring
the two halves of the housing together
to form a holy Union of hermetically
sealed happiness I have to say I was a
little surprised to see an exposed PCB
but if you look really closely you can
actually see that the housing is ever so
slightly thinner where it rests which
should give you then some idea of how
tight the space constraints were for
this product the whole package is very
light at just 45 grams and setup is easy
you don't have to change any settings or
turn the mic on separately it just works
but how well
does it work well we could have done all
of our testing in the local pool but
that costs 375 for admission and since
it wasn't going to be me doing the test
anyway we decided to send the new guy to
run some tests in this temperate waters
of the Canadian Pacific I mean what
better underwater aural experience to
capture than the screams of a panicked
lmg writer being subjected to
temperatures low enough to store your
leftovers
we started by running some highly
conventional tests using both the hero
force internal mic and the Sennheiser
elements microphone including the bel
air test oh this is the story and the
extreme close-up but then we got a
little confused the hero force basic
standard waterproof housing obstructs
the internal mic resulting in muffled
distant sound especially when recording
speech so then the elements kicks ass
out of the water especially considering
it's at the end of a stick five feet
away oh it was already a bad idea
but that's not what we were antibiotics
and when it comes to the difference
under the water well I'll let you guys
be the judge of that finally at that
point then that we fired up the
reviewers guide and realized that the
elements isn't really meant to be some
epic James Cameron level underwater
camera in fact it's only rated for
pressures of one bar for up to 30 min
what does that mean one bar that's just
sea level here so practically speaking
then it means you can probably take this
thing snorkeling for about a half an
hour which is okay I guess but I really
wish that it was rated to the same depth
as the waterproof housing that it's
replacing I mean am I even going to be
able to take this thing next time I want
to go cliff diving though at this point
you guys are probably thinking come on
cheer up Linus focus on the other points
memba the windshield yeah I member and
you know what it actually does do a
really good job above ground
we took our hero 4 on a little bike ride
comparing the sound quality between the
GoPros standard closed-back housing the
open backed housing and the elements
Mike and with the closed back housing
the internal mic basically only picked
up noise from the bikes front tire
almost nothing being said by the rider
the open back housing started off doing
a pretty reasonable job at capturing
voice
but soon encountered its arch-nemesis
wind once the bike started moving
and coming back to the elements both of
these were complete non issues yourself
on a psyche and your ratifies things
that it's really like that the
windshield completely cut out wind noise
during our bike test and it even worked
when wet not only that but it doesn't
capture a lot of the creaks squeaks and
other handling noises that the internal
mic does because it's mounted using a
flexible shockproof standoff so bottom
line then right now this is the only
works with GoPro certified bike can't
believe it took this long you can use it
with mostly the same mentality that you
would your GoPro and it sounds great
compared to the onboard mic so while it
isn't the magical product we wanted it
to be if you've got two hundred dollars
to blow on better GoPro audio until the
Chinese me two brands clone it and even
probably long afterward this looks like
your best choice whether you wear spiky
hair and run around describing things as
over 9,000 or you hide your anime love
