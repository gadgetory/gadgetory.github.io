the great gaming content on their
YouTube channel as well as phantom glass
the ultimate gorilla glass screen
protector for your mobile device hey
guys we're here at the Tesoro booth with
one of the most interesting name
products I think I've ever seen this is
the - zona The Burning Blade it's a
keyboard not a sword but it has a pretty
cool name anyways just starting off it
has Cale switches which are fully RGB
compatible this is 256 million colors
freaking insane we're seeing this from
quite a few companies lately but
personally this is the first one that
I've seen hands on so I don't know I'm
pretty impressed it's kind of cool to
see that also it has custom custom
bindable macro keys here where you can
sit set a record button press whatever
the heck you want then they will do
whatever you want there in an
interesting location right under your
space bar which is pretty cool because
if you say jump and then just slide down
you can actually press that button right
away which is an interesting spot to
have them traditionally we just see them
on say like f keys or off onto the left
side of the keyboard but not in this
case which i think is pretty cool also
on the left side of the keyboard you
will notice there is a USB slot for that
USB sort slot there's direct DC in which
is an option so you can have that slot
powered just in case you want to plug
something pretty intense into it or if
say you want to charge something off of
it it's not a bad idea to power that and
will come with that DC jack so that's
not a bad idea at all but that's not
it's only function it's not even
necessarily its main function its main
function and coolest function in my
opinion is that you can take the numpad
off the right side of the keyboard which
is held in there by magnets which is
cool so it won't just flop off change
where the USB port is going on that
numpad and put it on the other side an
interesting option because some people
not necessarily me because I've pretty
awkwardly wide shoulders that I can't
fit in any dress shirts for but in
someone who it doesn't necessarily have
my shoulders your shoulder width is
probably not proper for an entire full
keyboard with the numpad and it's
actually better for you to have a
keyboard without a numpad on it so this
gives you the option to have the numpad
on the left side of the keyboard which
won't screw up your shoulder width that
means basically being able to have your
hand on the mouse and on WASD on the
keyboard at the same time won't have you
during this like spread-eagle pose which
is not actually that good for your
shoulders Taryn knows this first hand as
he has tendinitis so posture and how you
use your keyboard is actually quite
important so that's something to think
about it might not be a bad idea to get
keyword where you can either move the
numpad or a 10 keyless keyboard entirely
one thing that I miss guys is that you
can set some of the primary color modes
on the keyboard but most of the color
functionality and as of right now almost
all of the color functionality is going
to be through software that software
isn't available here at the show so I
can't show you all of the RGB nests but
you'll be able to see it at some point
in time thank you for checking out our
Tesoro video if you want to see all of
our videos from here at pax check out
Linus tech tips which you're on right
