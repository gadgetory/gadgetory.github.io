protector for your mobile device hey
guys we're here at the tesoro booth with
one of the most interesting name
products I think I've ever seen this is
the chasuna the burning blade it's a
keyboard not a sword but it has a pretty
cool name anyways just starting off it
has Kail switches which are fully RGB
compatible this is 256 million colors
freaking insane we're seeing this from
quite a few companies lately but
personally this is the first one that
I've seen hands on so I don't know I'm
pretty impressed it's kind of cool to
see that also it has custom custom
bindable macro keys here where you can
sit set a record button press whatever
the heck you want then they will do
whatever you want there in an
interesting location right under your
space bar which is pretty cool because
if you say jump and then just slide down
you can actually press that button right
away which is an interesting spot to
have them traditionally we just see them
on say like f keys or off onto the left
side of the keyboard but not in this
case which i think is pretty cool also
on the left side of the keyboard you
will notice there is a USB slot for that
USB sorts lot there's direct DC in which
is an option so you have that slot
powered just in case you want to plug
something pretty intense into it or if
so you want to charge something off it
it's not a bad idea to power that it
will come with that DC jack so that's
not a bad idea at all but that's not
it's only function that's not even
necessarily its main function its main
function and coolest functioned in my
opinion is that you can take the numpad
off the right side of the keyboard which
is held in there by magnets which is
cool so we'll just flop off change where
the USB port is going on that num pad
and put it on the other side an
interesting option because some people
not necessarily me because I've pretty
awkwardly wide shoulders that I can't
fit in any dress shirts for but in
someone who it doesn't necessarily have
my shoulders your shoulder width is
probably not proper for an entire full
keyboard with the numpad and it's
actually better for you to have a
keyboard without a numpad on it so this
gives you the option to have the num pad
on the left side of the keyboard which
won't screw up your shoulder with that
means basically being able to have your
hand on the mouse and on WASD on the
keyboard at the same time won't have you
during this like spread eagle pose which
is not actually that good for your
shoulders taryn knows this firsthand as
he has tendonitis so posture and how you
use your keyboard is actually quite
important so that's something to think
about it might not be a bad idea to get
key word where you can either move the
num pad or a 10 keyless keyboard
entirely one thing that I miss guys is
that you can set some of the primary
color modes on the keyboard but most of
the color functionality and as of right
now almost all of the color
functionality is going to be through
software that software isn't available
here at the show so I can't show you all
of the RGB nice but you'll be able to
see it at some point in time thank you
