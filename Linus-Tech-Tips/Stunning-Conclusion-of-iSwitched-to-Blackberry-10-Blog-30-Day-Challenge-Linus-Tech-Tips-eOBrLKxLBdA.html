corsair voyager air the high-performance
wireless media hub for your connected
life visit corsair calm / voyager dash
air to learn more hey guys i'm going to
keep this video nice short and sweet to
see my other three installments on my
blackberry i switched you can check here
here and here to say something that i've
said in the previous videos i find this
phone very business-oriented why you
might ask is because the hub the hub is
amazing you can get to text messages
email phone calls any notifications you
could possibly want are in the hub so
you can check up on your entire social
life and all of anything you need to
take care of right now so quickly and so
efficiently it's just awesome so it
totally makes sense for business use
that and now i cant rember the name of
it right now but the encrypted like
business section of your phone versus
the not encrypted personal section of
your phone that's awesome the hold is
just functionality for business is what
this phone is about so i totally
understand that now at the same time I
would not personally want to use this
phone all the time after this I switched
I'm going back to my s3 very happily
because I like to mess around with my
phone a ton and while you can sideload
apps it's not the same I like to toy
with my phone way more i like to do all
that other kind of stuff so while this
is very efficient and to be honest i'd
love to run with both of them annoying
pockets i can't afford that but i would
love to because if i was on the run but
knew i had to check up on a text message
or an email or something i'd without the
blackberry if I was sitting somewhere
and I had some time I'd whip on my s3
and that would be great but again not
really for me so that basically
concludes it it's not for me but it's
definitely for some people and if you're
someone who wants to have the time on
your phone be very efficient this might
be the phone for you I hope you enjoyed
my blackberry I switched make sure to
