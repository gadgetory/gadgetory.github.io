water bottle is this oh my god is this
vodka you should be using this one get
out of here - isn't here we got a little
extra can't chill that fast
ah guys okay let's get this it's the
land show I demand order it's the wine
show with only brunettes this week are
we yeah
so welcome I'm kind of a sandy brunette
I'm a mousy blonde anyway that's a thing
this week what are we gonna talk about
Riley let me tell ya I mean not you did
the script you don't have the points on
the top of it I don't have anything here
let me tell you we're gonna talk about
the Apple the newest patent for Apple's
forthcoming folding phones which is not
announced but seems all but assured
we're gonna talk about the xbox game
pass for PC and deepmind
has added again with a new AI that can
kick your body at video games this time
in a first-person shooter that we all
love quake 3 arena yep we're doomed
weird ah good one really ensure all that
intro it's not getting better than that
boom well you think the folding iPhone
is a shirred hold on
the encodes rolling spots there's a
sponsor's hey Brad close
and that
there it is
salmon jerky ah what I did it guys good
guys this is not gonna savage jerky okay
abort abort oh I know what to do boom
jerky sorry guys and where's one more I
should have known I should have known
not to put me in this chair after what
happened when I was with Luke the most
stressful part is over now we can just
talk I don't want to go in that order do
you want to talk to that phone first
it's up to you man it's at the top okay
let's let's do it because I saw this I
saw this story and I did not include it
in tech link today okay because I
thought it was like that's who knows
whether it's real but you seem pretty
confident well only insofar as they have
a pretty good pile of patents about
foldable phones now mm-hmm
there's several patents Oda and I'm
aware that a lot of patents and
particularly a lot of apple patents do
not become products yes I'm aware of
that well as long as you're aware I'm
aware of that but they've got a bunch
and it I don't want to get into these
questions quite yet let's just talk
about the latest patent first okay wait
what is the latest patent described it
describes a device that is has multiple
folds like a wallet mmm can you you're
gonna get that photo up for every button
it up right now
we respect you said oh god okay nice
look at that
all right I know how to do things
there's a little diagram here
keep going to go down go the diagram
this is a ring scroll and slow or hold
there we go boom
so the one on the well you can see the
bottom the cross-section kind of thing
I'll fold that phones to a phone that
folds twice and I guess the point here
is you may not want a crease which seems
kind of inevitable
a perceptible crease in the middle of
your old
screen you might not want that in the
middle of your OLED screen you might
want to that are kind of near nearer to
the edges maybe a third from a way that
from the edge that is less perceptible
even though there's two of them what do
you think well I don't understand how
this is going to be any better than some
of the other folding phones we've seen
so far I mean like III don't really feel
super confident in any folding phone
design until we see another one come out
because the only one that we've seen
come out is the Galaxy fold and it was a
complete disaster
yeah like it's hard for me to get
excited about this because like yes it
seems more efficient why is it that you
can't use your imagination and make a
determination I'm just not very what it
is no I don't mean to be like that what
I'm really asking you or what what do
you think are the questions that can't
be answered like maybe one question is
is it gonna get scratched if it folds
such that the screens on the outside hmm
or okay wait look at that one more time
because I'm kind of confused looking at
it so what's the outside this is the
screen right here
I would can use your mouse yep this is
that the stat would be fully open and
this is the outside that would be this
is different this is a different design
I don't I don't even know what figure
one really is I'm looking at for a
figure for a I think jumps from figure 1
a 2 1 B 2 4 a well we're looking at an
article not an actual patent document so
but if we look at the bottom diagram I
think that the screen would be inside of
there to the to the top side of my
magnifying glass right now that would be
screen the bottom side of my magnifying
glass would be outside going on the
inside of this curve would be screen now
that's a huge problem like well how are
they gonna how are they gonna do this is
there gonna be like felt on on this part
of the phone so that the screen doesn't
get scratched we wouldn't be glass
content just be glass on glass glass on
glass that'd be okay I mean that's I
don't know like I mean it sounds
dangerous what if you know what the
problem is is that if you get debris in
there oh and then you fold the glass
onto the glass
that's bad that's not good that's bad
the biggest problem I have with these
things is do I necessarily want like
matters never created or destroyed okay
it's just folded in this case am I
convinced that I want the dimensions to
be different than this this fits into a
pocket okay this is a pixel three it's
pretty much the smallest phone you can
get anymore and it still fits in most
front pockets of most men's pants that I
wear it's actually still a little too
tall for jeans I have it like sitting
down in jeans with this sucks so do I
want it to be half as long but then
twice as or three times as thick in this
case no I I don't and this is what's so
weird about the whole folding phone
trend is that for years phones have been
getting thinner and thinner and thinner
and like companies are boasting about we
made the thinnest phone and now all of a
sudden they want to make folding phones
and everyone's like they assume that
people are gonna be fine with having
like a chunky chunky boy in there in
their pocket and I don't want that well
anyone want that link is what I'm trying
to figure out because either they take a
phone that's this size when it's
unfolded and they just make it shorter
and fatter when it is folded or they
make a phone that's maybe this big but
thicker when folded but when unfolded is
really huge and I don't want that either
I don't need a phone that like the
galaxy bulbs is probably too big I don't
I don't want to hold a Sega Game Gear
see the galaxy fold I found interesting
because it was thick but it wasn't so
thick that I couldn't conceive of having
that in my pants pocket or in like you
know the the demo guys kept putting it
into there that's a stretch jacket
pockets I don't know a jacket pocket
yeah a breast pocket on a button-up
shirt no no I can't even put this in
there without it being I've had anything
in there come on a pencil I'd best but
this is what's so interesting with the
whole Huawei thing because while we
actually had a really good design for
their phone like I liked their design
way better than the Galaxy fold where it
went folded it was almost as thin as you
know any random smartphone you pick up
or as thin as a smartphone we're like
with a case on it yeah because it ended
up being thicker anyways so
I don't know I mean so what has there
been any information about this
particular problem there's one other
thing I want to sign why is this go back
to the picture for us yes sir
another thing i annoy me is these really
gradual curves like on the I think on
the highway design is well on all of
them they're not like hinges that close
and seal completely like this such that
the sides are completely adjacent to
each other and abutting they're they're
kind of wedged because the screen can't
full at such an extreme angle it has to
gently fold right yeah so you end up
getting this wedge kind of void he's
wearing this shirt we don't have to both
wear the shirt Boyd holding up shirts
disappointed as to wear these like I
gave you this shirt to wear why aren't
you wearing it Lord I'm representing two
of your babies we're individuals okay we
have personalities my concern is it will
feel weird in your pocket or if I put
too much weight on that wider part of
the phone maybe it'll bend it or
something yeah it just doesn't feel as
clean as something that's just
completely folded over right like the
Huawei phone that one's not completely
full but the screens on the outside so
you don't need to worry about creasing
the screen because the inside is
completely flat it's a complete flat
crease and on the outside it can be
curved because it's on the outside yeah
bring up a picture of it that's true you
see but then obviously those concerns
about yours now your screens are on the
outside yes but I mean when I put this
in my pocket the outside your screens
always on the answer I don't put this in
the same pocket as keys or nothing right
no as me although you know for some
reason on jeans there's like a little
stud kind of I don't know what that's
for yeah it's just like a vestige of
like this would jeans look like to be
cool that's the main reason I wear jeans
a but you know I'm talking about the
little metal kind of nipple that's yeah
at the top of a pocket usually on the
right side sometimes I slide my phone in
my pocket with the back toward that just
in case or other little considerations
like that other hazards you're not gonna
be able to avoid as easily it'll be
twofold that's true ah we are the best
unintentional I didn't plan that doom
fun at all really no it was good I'm
glad that you had that much confidence I
mean I figured because like screen
protectors are
they're easy you know and if you could
figure out a the screen the folding
screen you can figure out a folding
screen protector maybe I don't I'm not
an engineer what do I know okay heating
the displays crease what's this about
okay so that's a list of patents that
Apple already made oh and some of them
are more ambiguous like hey we're
patenting a folding device
we're patenting in a device that has its
components in two different housing
chambers okay fair enough it seems like
every folding phones gonna have that but
they have some more specific ones that
are interesting like I guess they must
have done enough testing to figure out
that it doesn't the folding performance
degrades and super cold climates so I
guess it would be you know more brittle
less pliable if it's cool so what they
did was they have a patent for heating
up the area of the screen where it folds
and I think they did it just by turning
on the pixels and just shining like
light at them I haven't read the whole
patent myself I haven't even read the
whole app Shack oh but that's that's
what this says somewhere Oh self heated
yeah right yeah pretty cool portion of
the display that overlaps the bend axis
maybe self heated by illuminating pixels
in the portion of the display that
overlapped the bend axis or maybe heated
using a heating element or other heating
structure that's crazy I don't that I
don't like it there's obviously thinking
about it to the extent that they I was
thinking who knows what level released
one but here's a question for you yes
Steve Jobs okay he seemed to have like
vision for each of the products in terms
of what would like that 10 out of 10
version of this product look like like
to him the 10 out of 10 version of a
laptop was like a book you know in the
early 90s he always wanted to make a
computer that just looked like a book
and can carry it around right and then
they eventually got to do that with the
iPad sort of yeah so what do you think
his idea of the optimal folding phone
would be because I feel like when he's
unveiling the iPhone 5 he's like this is
the best phone design there is it fits
in your hand if we still had I I
had Jobs Steve Jobs yeah which would he
like folding phones or not probably I
mean this double I mean if the iPad was
his idea for like because you know you
what he wanted people to have books it's
a folding phone I don't know you know
like I just it's hard for me to get
excited about folding phones right now
okay the wallet we all got excited we
all went there James and we got hurt
it's a it's new it's a nascent category
okay check out that picture of the
double folded folding phone kind of
looks like a wallet
what the one that oh no we're gonna
update down no no no kind of looks like
a wallet and I feel like the his
emphasis on a computer looking like a
real world analog object you're already
familiar with like a book he might have
thought hey looking like a wallet school
you can it's the only thing you need to
carry with you you don't need your wall
anymore you have Apple pay but like
wallets are only okay to be in that kind
of fold position because you sit on them
I put my wallet in my front pocket do
you yeah do you have like one of those
thin wall oh dude I have a thin wallet
too not a cent is mine but that's why
it's double okay for me to put it in my
back pocket that puppy why would you
want that in your back pocket pretty
close now if this was a phone I could be
even thinner than you oh wow look at
that and god it's time to move on you're
done bud
it's over you know what's next well you
get to tell me all about her why do you
want to stock more you got more to say
about the folding phone that's good that
thing you love so much
I'm willing to try it I'm not writing it
off I've got everything I went in it's
like a relationship I don't want to get
hurt again you know it's it's toxic it's
all you spent three grand on one well I
spent a lot of my time talking about it
and reading about it huh that's move on
okay guys you want to hear about game
xbox game pass for PC Microsoft
everyone's like yeah
I can hear them my croissant oh he would
not who Oh Steve Jobs they're saying
that Steve Jobs wouldn't like folding
foam who said that the chat all of the
chat some of the chat I want names yeah
well we got you cm rich that's enough
names sorry I knew it was rich I got
cerebral all the fans all the viewers
some okay Xbox game pass for PC now
they're doing it and that's the main
thing that's a big takeaway okay let me
get this straight
what do you know about it okay here's
what I know I know that Xbox game Pass
is a subscription service which I
believe is ten dollars a month on the
Xbox one it gives you access to a
library of games that library of game
it's just like Netflix but games that
library of games gets updated with new
games as I understand it
Microsoft tries to have launches be
simultaneous so a Forza 4 comes out
independently you know it comes out it
should launch the same day on game Pass
also as an Xbox game Studios title yeah
they have more control over those ones
right but I also understand that people
are pretty stoked on game paths like the
games on it don't suck it's not like
they're only indie games jumping what
games are on it
game Pass has been around for a long
time I know but but the thing is the
thing that's weird about this and let me
put the PC version boom the thing that's
weird about this one is that it's not
just literally the exact same program
being ported to PC it's a separate
program for PC like with PC games it's
not like you're getting Xbox games on PC
right so it's kind of like what are they
gonna have good PC titles like they have
Bethesda in their Deep Silver devolver
digital paradox Sega and then Xbox is
own and stuff that they are talking
about right now but like is there an
actual list of games that they're gonna
have they're gonna give us way more
details we think at e3 okay yeah the big
part of this well okay so let's continue
summarizing game paths like that's so
that's basically it it's ten bucks a
month and you don't get it's not
streaming you know no you can download
them you're downloading them you don't
own them
right you can play them and they can get
removed from the game past library if a
game gets removed they give you advance
warning yeah it gets removed your save
game remains so you could in theory go
and buy the game and you'll still have
your saves you're not gonna go okay well
that's not so bad
not so bad so it's like any subscription
service like Netflix and I like I went
to watch one of the Lord of the Rings
like recently and it was gone oh yes
there's nothing I want them in a Netflix
but there's some people like force it
was a big one when it came out for some
people a new game comes out like that
it's gonna be 60 bucks
yeah that's six months of the service
like the service is worth it for one
game it get pays for itself after one
game that you really like now if I'm not
mistaken there are services like this on
PC already like EA access mm-hmm but I
guess this will I mean I wonder if there
will be like cross-contamination no you
know like like games on multiple
services yeah so I Microsoft is still
gonna be putting their games on other in
other places like Steam and stuff like
that okay so and that's the other big
thing from this announcement is that
they're gonna be putting more games on
Steam that's what excites me about this
because before I think they have the
Master Chief collection they said was
coming to steam and I think halo wars is
on Steam okay but they have said
Microsoft that they're going to be
releasing more games in win32 format so
they will be on Steam they might be on
other stores like the epic game store or
whatever so that is exciting to me
because that means that Microsoft is
actually starting to walk the walk now
and not just talk to talk about how they
want to care about PC gamers yeah I
think overall under Satya Nadella
Microsoft seems to be kind of decoupling
like they're trying to be less of a
platformer more of a service they're
trying to be less siloed and more kind
of modular which is pretty sweet I think
it's working out for them what I wonder
about this announcement is whether it's
ever gonna be one kind of harmonious
thing with the
console you know what I mean I think
that's their endgame how far away is
that well that's this is the funny thing
about is because that was what the whole
point was of making Universal windows
apps and putting them on Xbox and the
Windows Store mm-hmm so but everyone
hated that because you can only go by
these games like you can buy the game on
PC but you can only go buy it from the
Windows Store in uwp format which you
know you can't like you can only launch
it through the Windows Store it's not
like there's all these janky things
about it yeah so now they've basically
this is them basically saying yeah the
whole uwp thing yeah weird that's we're
kind of done with that yeah and so yeah
what does that mean for their end game
when if they want to make games
basically just like you buy the game you
have it on Xbox you have it on Microsoft
on PC like eventually the idea is but on
Xbox you have it on Microsoft on PC like
eventually the idea is that those won't
even be separate files like an Xbox is
just gonna be another I mean it's gonna
be interesting when they launch the next
Xbox to see whether it is like a console
subsidized PC whether it's just like a
PC well here's an extra data point for
that theory which is something called
Xbox game pass unlimited we just it's
announced but it's not out yet I keep I
forgot this dream was on the document it
was just looking up talking the whole
time yeah dude know now they know all of
our secrets oh no that's okay but it's
just a little it's boring if you're
gonna talk for a long time it should be
like yeah you should be on your face I
am on my face under my face okay so Xbox
game paths ultimate isn't is announced
not out yet and what it is is it's
essentially just a bundle of Xbox Live
Gold and the Xbox game past oh it's not
really cheaper okay so game pass is what
ten bucks a month for one hundred twenty
a year and then Xbox Live is also ten
dollars a month if you pay
month-by-month but if you buy a year
upfront it's 60 bucks so if you take the
cost of a year of Xbox Live up front of
$60 and you add that to one hundred and
twenty dollars of Xbox game pass for a
year that equals one hundred eighty
dollars which is the exact same annual
price
as game pass ultimate oh so there's not
really any savings except for you know
if you're the type of person who does
get month to month Xbox Live
it's a saving in that way and you have
more freedom because you can cancel at
any time you're not kind of locked in
however there's an there's now rumors
that ultimate is going to include with
no extra cost Xbox game pass for a PC oh
so then it is a savings okay that is a
deal yeah and it's also it's also
interesting from a strategic point of
view because I don't get it it's like
why did they do that did they do it to
sell more Xbox game pass subscriptions
do because it's not helping you so the
more people that you have using your
platform I mean like if somebody has an
Xbox and a PC and they sign up for it
and they're you know using your Xbox but
then like oh they're brothers using the
Xbox so then they go to play on the PC
they can technically say that's you know
to like this many people are playing on
PC you know when really that person
mainly got it for Xbox so they decided
to play it on this PC a little bit too
I'm trying to figure out if they're
trying to drive more customers on the PC
end or if they're using PC players and
driving customers on the console end or
kind of both or what the big idea is I
think it's both I might believe you
might be one on the short term in a
different one in the long term I think
that this might be just part of
Microsoft's push that they're doing
right now to like make people like them
again hey you want a game pass well you
can have it on Xbox and PC please use
our products you can have a Nintendo
switch please buy Xbox is because we
don't have good exclusives hey they
don't
Playstations got all the good I was an
Xbox guy my whole childhood okay I've
never had a Playstation but I recognize
that they have better exclusives that's
just the way it is yeah it always has
been
ok moving on we got to keep it moving
here James you could go in here unless

stuck in them to check that stuck way up
there is it hallo I know hallo yeah I
love halo okay hey that's like one game
series halo and forts are pretty much
set that's all anyone talks I do not
play racing games so that's not
interesting to me people I can feel
there's a disturbance fans everywhere
crying out don't like racing games okay
both is good all right yes both is good
sorry guys yeah I always loved that meme
from years ago it was like console wars
when mommy can only afford one luckily I
got I'm a grown-up now
yeah well I don't have any consoles you
say consoles okay Wow
you what do you what did you mean what
how do you say it console you say
console console yeah you're saying it
like those like the advisor like a
console you're saying it like I can so
of my friend I'm saying consoles you say
it sounds like you're talking about it's
the difference between consoles and
consoles I can soul you use I play a
console it sounds like you're saying
with shoes in Spanish console I'm here
with thongs oh that's that's that's come
that's consoles sake console is I know
that shoes is insoles in Spanish you're
saying you're saying wrong I'm saying it
right how do you same I'm dropping a
letter how do you say milk milk milk I
drink a glass of milk and then I lay my
head on my pillow
yeah pillows see I put the milk back in
the fridge I say pillow my mom says hey
guys welcome to the grammar show
pronunciation show brought to you by
brought to you by quake 3 arena no let's
do this part we're doing yes I've only
done two stories look at the time my
friend you're the tenure at time look at
the time
brought to you by gone Salvage jerky hey
there's some sabot jerky over that my
gosh you better eat some look at this
sriracha the rot your bacon there's you
you don't have this stuff up nope you go
back to this sriracha bacon I mean it
originates in Thailand it's a series of
consonants I can't pronounce properly
for sure
jerky is made with the best ingredients
without nitrates or preservatives with a
goal to create a snack that is full of
flavor and spice that isn't bad for you
some spices are bad for you
nitrates oh I see what you're saying
they've got 13 different flavors of
jerky like sriracha bacon and maple
buffalo bacon they also make barbecue
sauce hot sauce and oh no what'd you do
a spice rub I'm opening it he's going
for it there Carolina Reaper hot sauce
uses one of the hottest peppers in the
world that puppies hot whew that puppy's

not more than five that you have to know
I don't need to be not gonna use a VPN
on my Google home a second yeah five is
a great number and they have to include
DNS leak protection and ipv6 leak
protection they also have this really
neat feature that people love to have

box in the garbage I was like kind of a
know but also yeah that was in the
fridge all week alright two weeks oh
wait hold on he's putting in this car
now yeah she is what are you doing over
there
I already stomach Mateus be calm you
have anything to say about LTX it's
gonna be lit it's gonna be sweet let's
go what I get to be the showrunner we're
gonna have a stage Oh various panels Wow
I get to I don't think I'm allowed to
roast people in between shows panel I
don't know I like that you guys we agree
I don't know how to pronounce template
what do you say template oh this person
likes template someone says we were
saying template wrong
and with a template or a template
sometimes I like to contemplate
different templates we use and okay guys
yeah robots they're taken over this is
the next topic I love deep mind you love
him I love deep mind they're awesome
three arena nothing is safe anymore no
okay so the context here I'm sure a lot
of our viewers know this deep mind is a
subsidiary of Google they make that you
primarily use machine learning to make
AI they are advancing AI via gaming
because the world of gaming have these
really discrete scenarios that you can
control control a number of variables is
a lot simpler than trying to make an AI
they can just live in the world I'm
planet Earth like weekend it's a good
place so they started off with chess
they made several AI that just destroyed
everything that ever had existed in
chess in a short amount of time than any
other robot have able to do it then they
advanced into the world of go a game
that was hitherto unknown by many
Westerners notice is huge in China
probably even bigger than chess is in
the West it's a more complex game than
chess
go our alphago which is made by deep
mind is the best system living or or
silicon or net in the world yeah that
can play go then we moved on to
Starcraft and they started smashing some
pros at Starcraft in certain ways it
wasn't a completely fair fight but it
was still impressive and now they're
approaching the holy grail it's uh it's
scary first-person shooters because is
this the first one that I don't know I
don't know if there's a scarier or not
by virtue of it being in 3d but is this
the first one that like features an AI
like controlling an avatar in 3d like
kind of moving around like you don't
don't in StarCraft you know you can from
these hell units to go places from
deepmind I believe it is I can't speak
to whether or not there are other 3d
game playing AI I suspect there probably
are they're probably not as good as this
one like the regular AI in every shooter
game but this is different
but those aren't those are programmed
they're not like yeah those are
unconscious like this one is their
running yeah those are running scripts
they're not they didn't teach themselves
like the way that deep mind trains us is
just aren't we just running scripts
James no I wish we had a bit like a
replica pistol that I could just talk
and point that my that were doing a
great sound yeah for that but yeah so
this machine just was taught the rule it
wasn't even taught the rules it's put
into the game space it has some kind of
prime directive like wind noise go back
to the main yeah go to us or I start
scrolling like crazy sorry if that it
irritates anybody where I'm just like
scrolling through the article this
machine is playing against itself okay
it's learning the rules by playing
against itself it's learning strategies
by playing its against itself it's
plenty against itself 200,000 times yeah
yeah yeah that's crazy I couldn't find
something saying how long that took it
to play 200,000 matches because I know
that with the dota 1 like it'll play
like a thousand matches in like good
afternoon and it's yeah yeah yeah like
something ridiculous like that so like
when it when it had played a hundred
thousand matches it beat humans like
okay but then when it would crush me
after the by the times it doubled that
matched count it would it was just like
destroying everybody yeah so what they
say is that it was beating I think they
were doing 2v2 and to humans yeah to v2
to BOTS versus to humans humans got on
average they're playing capture the flag
they got on average 16 fewer flags
whatever game per game okay I like I
guess they didn't have my flights you
need to win I guess they didn't have a
cap on how many flags you can grab I've
played quake land parties here with all
with all of us and I don't think anyone
got like 16 or 20 points it must have
been like a timed game or something it
seems like the the purpose of this whole
setup was not to have the bots win but
just to humiliate the human player well
it's really cool how they how they did
it they did something called like a an
evolutionary
genetic approach to the training so they
they have multiple like iterations of
the machine like the game has populated
only by different iterations of the
machine yes no it's not learning against
human players it's just all deep mines
in there and then whichever ones suck
just get destroyed
there their code gets discarded they
mutate the remaining code which makes it
kind of like a random new a random
mutation just like an evolution and then
if that is better then it gets to stay
so when they when these machines first
plop into the level they first just they
first figured out the concept of I have
a base this is my base then through more
playing they figure that out
yes this is my base yes and I'm blue
it's blue and then they figured out
there's another base there's an opposing
team space then later they figured out
its advantageous to kill the other
players but they have to go through the
ages to higher things so they didn't
tell them any of this
no that's and that is what is truly
horrifying horrifying like fascinating
but it's like it's kind of like that's
sick fascination when you're watching a
horror movie and like the the bad guy is
like eviscerating somebody in like a
really unusual way and you're like what
is he doing this rating means taking
your organs out doesn't okay I thought
you just you know okay you know
interesting way I thought you might well
you could just grab the organs or you
can be like you know you can draw yeah
anyways it's that kind of horrible way
yeah where I'm just kind of like they
taught themselves and then they learned
Shakespeare or something or they or they
wrote Shakespeare that was the
difference between alpha go and alpha 0
mean Shakespeare's oh yeah he's
everything no I mean like eventually if
you leave them in the quake simulation
for long enough there's a whole
civilization 100 monkeys typing like
yeah on typewriter yeah avenge the
difference between alphago which was the
original chess playing 1 and alpha zero
was with alphago they taught at the
rules of chess and they gave it matches
a historical matches between pros and
they got to observe human players and
then learn from there with alpha zero
they were just like
play yourself and it just figured it
figured out the game and then at the end
they say and it sounds like this
congratulations you played yourself
we're all losers learn how to do puns
while working here oh you don't have
more things no that's all I had time to
put in today oh really
yeah we can keep talking but there's you
know there's more topics at the bottom
so I figured we can lean on those which
is where we are now
no but there's more engine interesting
question then how will this affect game
design because well yes there yet let's
go to the previous question which is how
I think leads into the second question
how will human players use AI yeah
because think about when when there
became AI it for chess like you can play
just against the computer when you're
playing chess I think a lot of people do
that a lot of people train that way a
lot of beginners do it too you don't
have anyone to play with right what's it
gonna be like when let's say it's
Starcraft you're playing Starcraft and
the best Starcraft player is the AI like
this this machine learned strategies
right yeah and you would think that it
would kind of converge on an optimal
strategy and then so if the pros are
training by playing AI and not training
by playing humans then the pros are
gonna mimic what the AI does mm-hmm and
then all the humans are gonna be trying
to play like the AI and then that kind
of makes you think okay does that mean
that the AI has found the best strategy
for that game like for example if you're
talking about a game like Starcraft
where there's myriad strategies you
could go they could go brood Lawrence or
you could go hard roaches or whatever if
you're a third player James used to play
Starcraft this one would be like okay
every single time you should this is the
build you should do yeah and if your
game is like that where there's only one
like the meta is limited there's this is
the way to play well I fear that a worse
game than a game that where like
actually there are multiple ways you can
go and it's always interesting and is
that gonna impact game design going
forward well I feel like in games
already in professional games if there
becomes if a situation arises in which a
certain meta is always being used
by everybody all the time then that is
an indication to the developers that
they need to like nerf or buff something
Simba imbalanced yeah see I'm dropping I
used to game I know some game all you
haters yeah so like I feel like that's
that's a problem regardless of whether
there's AI or not in the in the system
you know like if everyone starts using
one strategy that means that that game
needs to change or it's not a good game
yeah yeah in in games generally that's
called via the size of the book so the
reason that chess is a more interesting
game than checkers is gonna have a
bigger book if you go to a checkers
tournament and the two main styles board
though yeah
if the pros in a tournament play like 42
games in a row yeah 39 and then will be
a draw like and they're playing the
exact same game every time mm-hmm
because there's no opportunity to go out
of book because there's just not that
many combinations of moves that make
sense to make but in chess and go as
you've heard that people like to say
these things like there's more chess
combinations than there are atoms in the
universe and stuff like that and it's
true and we that make some more
interesting games because once you get
like 100 moves into the game you can be
out of book you can be into all new
territory this is now now we've we have
a eyes now that can go off book you know
like like we that was a that was an
example in chess where like one of the a
I started using strategies that like no
one had really seen before really novel
yeah so are we gonna get to a point
where people don't even want to see
humans play each other in these games
because it's not as interesting well
because I wouldn't want to see like I
wouldn't be interested in seeing like
well maybe I would actually I was gonna
say I wouldn't be interested in seeing
robot like basketball players or
something but like I disagree that as I
think I wouldn't want to see that I
disagree that is less interesting and
here's why when when this quake machine
plays yep okay it may be developed a
really great strategy but how good is it
at aiming it is as good as they program
it to be at aiming that's a good you
know the point of like the
you have a really good Pro human player
is that this person has awesome reflexes
this person can just click on heads all
day whereas with the machine they're
just gonna say you're you're like
radical is this big the probability of
you getting a headshot is X and that's
just set and that's gonna have to be set
between all the different machines that
play each other
see now this so this is what the study
says about the abilities of the AI
versus the humans at close range the AI
excelled in combat but humans were
better snipers but that's tweakable it
is tweakable but that's because it's
reaction time was half of that of humans
and part because its accuracy was 80%
compared to the humans 50% but this is
only in this iteration of the game they
could change its accuracy that could
change its reaction time everything
right whereas with humans you're just
you have what you're born with or
whatever stimulating you can put in your
body that day that's what you do right
and that's why it's interesting one this
is the funny thing about any of this
kind of like AI stuff is that like
they're beating humans but usually the a
always has some sort of advantage like
in that dota 2 when we reported on or
was it dota 2 it was Starcraft yeah
in the Starcraft story when open AI
wasn't opening no mine so what you're
talking about is it had full map
knowledge initially it had full map
knowledge and then they took it away and
it did way worse yeah but okay it didn't
have full map knowledge it had fog of
war there were areas that were
unexplored on the map that it could not
see however it didn't have a viewport
like a human does right who has to pan
around it had vision of the whole map at
once which is yeah totally not fair and
I don't like that so this is why I don't
think that human play is gonna be less
interesting and we're just gonna watch a
tournament of robots doesn't really make
any sense
oh dude let's talk about the dual screen
laptops okay
bring it on do you have anything else to
say I watch Linus's video no I think we
pretty much covered it it's an
interesting topic do you know as I think
that's super interesting because laptops
have been completely stagnant in terms
of design for so long
Intel came out and was like project
Athena it's gonna it's just as good as
ultrabooks it's another design
initiative look it's gonna be really
good but it's like it doesn't really get
me excited which one was that project
Athena yeah
that's just like another kind of program
that they're doing where they have a
certain set of requirements for laptops
to hit like the Ultrabook program was
started by Intel they're like hey
laptops are big and chunky we want to
make them thin so they now what you
think of as an ultrabook a really thin
and light laptop that's because Intel
kind of made a push in the industry to
get manufacturers to start doing that so
project Athena is kind of like the same
thing but in terms of like performance
and you know cooling capacity and that
kind of stuff power efficiency I don't
know okay I don't actually seen the
requirements but that's what I know
about it so that was like you know they
announced it and is all it was almost
like they were putting that up just to
get people excited about it like to just
to have something to say because AMD was
like oh we have all these things going
on and we're cool to still there like
seven nanometer thoroughly good we're
cool I wish that and where people
actually talk like that like you go do
they know we're cool I wish people
actually talked like that like you go do
they welcome to MDK No thank you for
coming
yeah the cool stuff to say I guess okay
there's a few things I don't know maybe
not everyone has seen this video but
then book pro duo oh you're gonna show
us I was just gonna hold the puzzle
laughs describe what it looks like
what's it called it's uh okay it looks
like this you got a laptop right okay
you keep searching rally I don't know
what it's called
oh honey Chris here is what the heck
that was in tells a Seuss's is the
screen pad pro duo yeah that just looks
like this but it's got a screen here
have you not seen it yeah I watched the
video I said no I think that's about the
other one are you talking about are you
talking online buddy
sure you're dude get us up to speed put
that up
there's things in the way oh this one
with like has hinges right yeah yeah
yeah this is weird - screen boom okay
look at this
do not allow get out of here you're not
allowed make that bigger you guys
haven't seen this you didn't watch you
this what you reported on on Wednesday
I'm technically no but I can't see the
pictures I just read so like when it's
folded and when it's you know just a
normal mode like that that's basically
what the easiest one looks like yeah but
see that little hinge there see this
little doohickey yeah I see you can bend
that and have it kind of stand up oh and
it has like a little microsoft surface
type kicks down in the back it's got
going to support its weight yeah Wow see
okay if that ever wears out and gets
loose you're screwed yeah maybe another
hand weights another thing to breathe
think there's a little a vertically
standing stick behind it like a like a
post that's here maybe like actually
like the kickstand comes like this and
then there's another one you slide up
yeah that's a lot of moving parts yeah
that would be jank but I think seeing
this is just like you know as someone
you do this to we keep on top of all the
changes in design and like iterations
that people do to normal designs and
this is like this is one of the things
that I it's one of the first things I've
seen in a while that I'm kind of like oh
that's okay
yeah I don't hate it because the dual
screen thing without that extra hinge
mm-hmm I don't really get it cuz I'm
like show us that one well I guess you
can imagine it basically doesn't stand
it looks like this it looks like that so
Asus has a laptop that's like this but I
mean I guess that makes sense if you're
like hunching over your laptop but
that's not very ergonomic James Lynaugh
said it was really cool no I nosed it I
watched that video where he was like
into it and I think I said on my tech
link that I'm like I can't really trust
him because it doesn't think it's that
undergo nama cuz if I sit like this like
I am now
sometimes when I'm typing something
complex some reason I have to stare at
the keyboard not because I'm looking
where I'm typing just I don't know I
can't look at the screen I have to just
not but what's better if I do that my
neck is completely aligned and I'm
looking basically at the hinge area of
the laptop and that's where that screens
gonna be unless he was talking about
putting your document actually at the
bottom and having your other tertiary
little supporting yeah screens up there
and I can dig that but I'm just saying
that like from an ergonomic perspective
would I rather have that or would I
rather have this well this is more
options yes this is it's both it's
better the question of how much more is
it gonna cost
probably more I don't know they don't
like to pay how much more would you paid
if I don't wanna the same except for the
help that has that I don't wanna pay
anything $200 I just want to have it up
here how much would you pay for this I
didn't say that and how much more would
you pay well I don't know I need to know
what the base price point is okay
presumably these are gonna be like two
grand at least I should hope so
I mean there's more screen okay I like
one thing I like about both of these is
because there's a screen above the
keyboard it pushes your keyboard down
closer to the rim of your yeah you like
a lot of people don't like that I guess
you don't you lose a wrist rest you lose
the rest rest of and a bunch of these
laptops that are coming out with these
this new kind of push down keyboard are
coming with wrist rests so then you have
another thing to bring around in your
bag you're not gonna bring it around
with you you're not I'm not what if you
just had a little thing that slides out
and a very thin slides out tilts down
put your wrist on there huh I don't hate
the touchpad on the right I don't hate
that I like that a lot of people don't
like that but doesn't make any sense to
me because you're I mean what why you
want to move your hand further to the
center what do you mean you mean what do
you talk to some people don't like the
touchpad being on the right only got
yeah and I don't know why they don't
like it do you think that'd be a girl do
you know with this one this design that
you do like with the hinge do you know
if it's binary or if it's a like
continuous can I stand it and stop it at
any point along that along the way or is
it
either here or it's here well I haven't
seen really any views of the back so
they're all still trite have you seen a
video let's go back let's get I'm gonna
get away from them yeah he's gonna do
some stuff here and I go some hacking
guys and also I wonder the part that
stands up that has the screen in it
what's the internal is there is it super
light and it's only screen yeah look at
this look at like the back of a lap dog
of this one it doesn't look like there's
any RAM or battery or saw really like a
kickstand I think because if you look at
this one yeah those are different
configurations yeah but I don't think
there's like a like you were saying
there's a piece of clear acrylic right
there what we're just joking square no
it looks like that's just kind of you
can you can do whatever you want with
this I saw somebody on Twitter I think
saying that like eventually laptops will
have like just keep adding screen what
is this though is that chin bar or is
that just because they're watching you
to wear something chin bar like that's
dead space its Dead's because on the
Asus it looks like the the screens are
almost abutting each other does it not a
budding is that like inba is that not a
word there are jail I'm not challenging
you I'm asking it what budding a budding
a be you but DD a budding no T's a
betting what no that's a different word
eating and above is not the grammar show
this is look like third time we've
gotten into wordy oh man you really boil
my gears sometimes James you really
grind my eggs
I was the boil what is a budding oh my
goodness that's like a but and then hit
images one word a budding like that but
Grund be next to or have a common
boundary with well we learned something
on the land show today don't say we see
I we all did I'm saying we okay the
whole
audience except for the people there's
no way anyone else knew what that word
was enough it's not that obscure a
budding is a thing yeah
is that because the cheeks are next to
each other yeah yeah it's like about to
make it like a butt yeah maybe to make
as a butt to be but like yes it's to be
unhappy that's the etymology to Venge do
origin how much longer do we I see the
lioness we'll be back next week yeah
it's been a stressful week he's been in
Taiwan doing copy deck stuff all week
you know we barely made it we're down on
the wire we made it we filmed our last
video have we filmed a bunch of videos
without him yeah he's gonna come back
and be like what the heck one of those
videos got shot moments before this man
show it was stressful you guys but we
did it we did it we're a group of
friends together accomplish goals yeah
it sounds like this is we're ending it
sounds like it just because we the way
we're talking yeah we're just not
talking about anything important what if
we went for another five hours but we
does this we just kept talking like in
these conclusion type tones the holds
and so at the end of the day I guess
what's the next topic do you wanna do
one more Oh super shots this is do super
Chester Burge and fun hey there's one
how do you get there I never do this
they at the bottom there's a bunch just
Louie do we say the names Louis Gomez
yes you love turtles hey me too buddy
I like turtles thanks for the super chat
Drake Simmons is missing LTX this year a
mistake can Riley promise me a high-five
next year for missing this one he's
gonna Drake Drake that's a hundred
percent my dude I will high-five you
he's got a Raptors game he can't come
say hey this is gonna be a great one you
should really come to this one but I
guess if you can't then you're gonna
yeah it's that this year is gonna be
awesome
Ben Maitland I've read the original
paper the AI learns to aim okay oh damn
yeah oh so it just didn't get good
enough yeah thanks
BM says hi what's up dude love you
learns to aim but can't it just it'll
just be perfect eventually because
there's no disconnect like for me the
difference between I don't want to get
into this but the difference in games
and story started
we give difference in games and so is
that in a sport you have something in a
game you have something you want to do
and you can just do it like in chess I
want to move my knight to e4 I can just
do that right but in football I want to
throw the ball to it's to a grid space
on the field and even though I want it
to go there my body says nope it's not
quite going there yeah and your client
says yes but your body says yeah you
can't always execute what you want but
the Machine will always be able to
actually would want so therefore it's
it's less of a sport I'm not saying
eSports or sports I'm not saying they're
not but there's obviously a human
element where I try to aim somewhere and
I don't click on your head even it out
we need to make we need to put the AI
into a robot body and then make it play
the computer game with robot fingers
yeah not even that you would need to
throw in randomness well your lesson in
physical any anything in a physical
world there's more randomness than
digital I don't know having seen aliens
