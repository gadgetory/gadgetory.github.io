talking as I started recording but it's
just behind the scene oh so this is the
same place that we actually shot the
original one except we have here this
time we even have more of the product
that we're supposed to be making a video
about this is the KB 460 and we have got
some modified ones we have got some
stock ones and we're gonna be set up
here their necks a little bit so you
can't actually resist portal references
can you you want to show me how well
this this here suit fit see this would
like yeah super tight huge between the
keyboard and smash right there I
realized the whole smash TM that's good
just remember that there is no escape
so we have a minor snafu we have to take
a bit of a break in the whole filming
thing because the brilliant designers of
this doodad right here
so some of the recording notes like when
you're recording in slow mo speed we're
recording in 240 FPS 2 K some of the
recording modes require the SSDs to run
in rate so you can see we actually get
only 20 minutes of the cording time on
to 512gb SSD Zin rain so that's 2 K raw
240 frames per second but the problem is
that when you record to one of them in
sort of a normal non wave mode and then
you switch over to raid the SSD so it
was a mismatch in this version of the
firmware so yeah what we were doing zoom
on this is amazing like I can get
frightening ly close to I can like see
your every
seed speedo shot 1 take 1</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
