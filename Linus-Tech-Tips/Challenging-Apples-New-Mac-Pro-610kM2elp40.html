build the fastest Mac in the world using
virtualization to simplify the
hackintosh process was a huge success
except for the awkward timing where it
ended up coming out the very day that
Apple finally announced their new Mac
Pro which turned out to be faster than
ours but we're not beat yet ladies and
gentlemen hello yeah it's time so our
goal now is to go bare metal hackintosh
on the same 28 core cpu that we used
last time water coolant and overclock it
before Apple releases their new Mac Pro
to the public which gives us what three
months or so well considering that
Apple's had six years to work on theirs
I'd say we've got a lot of work to do
I'm here alright let's get going the
exclusive madrenas LTT vanilla cafe is a
delicious blend of coffee with a sweet
vanilla kick and right now for 72 hours
you can get 50% off your order with
offer code Linus and madrenas coffee
calm slash Linus
just the usual reminder we are not
endorsing the use of Mac OS on anything
other than a Mac in any way no
especially in a commercial environment
if you want to run Mac at work by Mac oh
yeah that in that case it is much better
to buy a Mac because then you actually
get support in order to build a
hackintosh that can compete with the new
Mac Pro we're going to need to do a few
things in preparation first and foremost
we need a motherboard that is comparable
in terms of expansion to the one that
Apple is shipping in their new cheese
grater and also one that is likely to be
compatible with Mac OS unfortunately
that means that our a sous dominus board
with its mere four PCI Express 16x slots
is out we turned instead to gigabyte c6
21 horas extreme they refer to this
thing as monster gaming motherboard and
I think they're pretty close to the mark
it's rocking seven PCI Express slots for
expansion and twelve ddr4 dimm slots
this should give us plenty of room to
maneuver and if we decide to liquid cool
our GPU setup it'll actually potentially
give us even more internal expansion
than Apple's big passive GPU coolers
will allow one area where we will be
making compromises though is external
expansion our board does have a header
to install a Titan Ridge Thunderbolt 3
card right around here and if we were in
so inclined we could pass through a
DisplayPort signal from our GPU for the
full Mac experience but we're limited to
just two of those right instead of what
is it six or something like that
yeah it was like two on the front and
like four on the back another difference
for us is our GPUs so we are stuck with
the Radeon seven the fastest available
card that is still compatible with the
latest version of Mac OS Mojave we
intend to install more than one of these
but guys we're still kind of in the
proof-of-concept phase here so we're
gonna grab one or two more when the time
comes
is this the slot you wanted for it this
one right here
next up is the memory now our CPU falls
well short of the up to 1.5 terabytes of
memory supported on the new Mac Pro but
it still does pretty well up to 512 gigs
and we want to have a pretty rockin
config for it but for today well we're
just validating so we slot it in six
sticks of ddr4 3,200 Trident Z RGB
modules from g.skill that's more than
enough for the tests that we're gonna
throw at it while also actually being a
fair bit faster than what Apple will be
shipping for the final build the plan is
384 gigs of the fastest 32 gig modules
that we can get our hands on yeah fully
decked out finally for our cpu we've got
the Xeon w30 175 X from our previous
video but this time we're not allocating
course to our host OS or dealing with
virtualization overhead because we're
going to boot Mac OS directly to cool
this thing well we've got some plans for
something really crazy that might take a
little bit of engineering know-how from
Alex but for now we've gone with the
Noctua Nhu 14s on top of the motherboard
box which is fine for case right I mean
we didn't really have much of a choice
actually it's the the board is
physically too large for any of the test
benches that we have here at the office
okay so enough preamble are we ready to
do it I think we're ready okay hopefully
I didn't break off the SATA connector
when I you know that around that would
be bad yeah punch it Chewie
theoretically this just works and it
just goes right to Mac OS right yeah I
think this is fine it was supposed to
boot up did you hit the keyboard by any
chance
No okay well you you don't trust me you
need Brandon to validate it okay so
that's it I'm a Mac bare-metal okay so
if you guys are wondering how we got
this done guys this is not a tutorial
but maybe walk them through some of the
steps that we had to go through yeah
again not a tutorial but I found that
using our previous vm based clover
install as a baseline gigabytes hardware
and firmware here actually basically was
compatible with mac OS out of the box
now I did have to install using USB 2.0
and I had to grab fake SMC to get passed
from ACPI ears while booting the
Installer
but once we got it on there everything
basically just worked
now everything needs a bit of an
asterisk iMessage and FaceTime do not
currently work on our hack Pro but we
intend to solve that one way or another
before the conclusion all right well you
want to see this denim in the truck yeah
I want to see a cinema entranc question
is that let's do it I think last time we
cracked ten thousand howhow do you think
it'll go now I would expect it to be at
least a touch higher cuz we're ditching
the virtualization overhead and we got a
couple more cores because we don't have
to leave anything for our host OS yeah
so that four extra threads okay so we
got eleven thousand four hundred thirty
nine yeah we're looking at results that
are about five percent faster in the
multi-threaded test and nearly 20%
faster single-threaded so as much as we
love virtualization we were actually
leaving a fair bit of performance on the
table yeah well why don't we fire up
Geekbench next let's do it well that
number looks a lot higher than last time
that's nearly eighty thousand multi-core
we're at about twenty three percent
higher in single threaded and nearly
nine percent higher in multi-core like
it's a big difference overall in CPU
curiously though our OpenCL and metal
scores don't look like they gained quite
as much so why don't we do Lux mark next
see what that should looking like okay
so now we've got a pattern here it looks
like in our GPU bound tests our
virtualization overhead wasn't hurting
us nearly as much as it was in the CPU
bound tests fascinating so now we want
to hit it with some non synthetic CPU
tests what do you want to start let's go
with blender and there sounds good wow
that's a lot of threads there it is so
1:16 we saved a couple of seconds on the
BMW test but more impressively we save
nearly half a minute on the classroom I
think this is the fastest we've ever
seen a Mac run these tests and I did the
Mozilla Firefox compiled test off-camera
and it went 40 percent faster Wow it
really only took nine minutes that's
crazy I think the only test left to run
from last time are then Final Cut Pro
and Henry yeah let's find out final cut
so this looks promising did we save it
sorry three minutes on our Final Cut Pro
test yeah
and nearly half a minute on handbrake
two which is actually really impressive
when you consider that it'll under six
minutes to begin with Wow
all right so how about them apples then
now keep in mind guys that this is
actually above the level of performance
that we would expect out of the new Mac
Pro for these workloads because while
the Xeon w-30 275 that apples using on
the high end has a slightly higher
single core boost clock it also has a
much lower base clock and a more
conservative TDP with the same core and
cache layout as our xeon w 3175 x oh and
don't forget that these tests were all
done its stock clocks to our CPU only
ever got 280 degrees under blender while
we boosted a 3.8 gigahertz all day long
if Apple's Mac Pro stops boosting
basically at all they lose on everything
but memory capacity so actually this is
looking like a really good start to the
project
it would appear that knocking on all the
wood I can find yeah it would appear
that nothing's gonna prevent us from
seeing it through to the end with that
said it's going to take some time
because if we're gonna do this thing
right we need to go all the way I want a
custom monoblock for this board as much
of the fastest RAM we can muster at
least one more Radeon seven and all core
overclock of 4 gigahertz minimum I
expect it to be damn near silence and I
want it all in a cheese grater
stay tuned guys because success or
failure this is going to be one hell of
a ride speaking of a wild ride this
crazy meandering segue to our sponsor
the mass drop ctrl keyboard features a
solid CNC aluminum frame with a built in
switch plate
it's got RGB lighting qmk firmware for
customizability and it's even got hot
swappable key switches so you can choose
between Cherry MX chi-wah halo switches
or heck some combination of the three it
features a floating key design with dual
USB type-c connectors and weighs nearly
a kilogram the first users who sign up
on drop com can actually get $10 off
this keyboard so don't wait head to the
link in the video description at drop
comm now so thanks for watching guys if
you disliked this video you can hit that
button but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description
also down there is our merch store which
has cool shirts like the one I'm wearing
it actually has oh yeah this is one of
our newest designs the hard drive shirt
I think it's really cool
and at our community forum which is
totally worth adjoining this motherboard
is almost the size of this thing on its
own Alex really thinks he can do this
that's what he says he also said he
could make a heatsink though</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
