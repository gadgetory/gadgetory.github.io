quickly demonstrate the power
consumption of the four-way SLI six core
machine while running a typical game so
I have race driver grid running at 1280
by 800 on my projector here and this is
actually I mentioned this in another
video I'm not sure if I ever upload it
or not though but this is my first time
gaming on a projector and so I've got my
G 25 wheels set up here and it's
actually pretty cool I don't know how
many inches this screen is but it's a
lot just projecting onto a white wall
it's actually kind of this projector is
just a demo unit that I get to have a
look out for a couple days but I think
it's pretty much got me convinced to all
that kind of build it's got me pretty
much convinced that I need to go out and
buy a projector now so anyway I'll get
the camera man or to go have a look at D
the energy meter that I have sitting on
the wall uncraft so I'm gonna get up in
turn on the light in the room here so
that you can actually read it so anyway
there that gives you some idea this is
not a worst-case scenario this is
running a fairly non demanding game
great isn't sort of the worst that
you'll see but what I saw before was
typically in the sort of 1000 watt range
so something to bear in mind is that
leads the system's probably pulling
about 850 watts during a typical gaming
load so I'm gonna actually update this
with some synthetic benchmarks which
should give us a more realistic absolute
maximum power consumption but what this
does tell us is that the 1500 watt power
supply is more than comfortable with the
load that this system can put out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
