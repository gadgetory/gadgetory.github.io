brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX welcome back to the msi suite
well we will be discussing the Twin
Frozr 5 which funnily enough has 5 new
features on it first of all there's the
LED logo on kind of a top of the card
which is nice because this is actually
somewhere will you'll be seeing these
things a lot of times you'll see really
cool graphics or design on the front of
the card where the fans are which you
won't often see so it's nice to be able
to see stuff where this LED logo is
after that we have this super su pipe
which is basically just a giant freaking
heat pipe going to kind of around the
middle of the card in a backwards S
shape which should hopefully help with
cooling after that we have 0 frozer
which might scare some of you because
one of the fans is not going to spin
under 50 degrees Celsius
but it's okay the cards fine once it
gets above 50 degrees Celsius both fans
will engage also there's the new gaming
app it's not afterburner it's kind of a
more simple casual style where there's
three different modes actual vary in
intensity of Clarke speed and then in
turn heat and fan speed and whatnot just
to keep your card cool but then if you
want to do something like be a awesome
spreadsheet man you don't necessarily
have to have your graphics card
massively over clocks you can have an in
silent mode will be a lot quieter last
but not least we have their Torx fan
which sports 19 percent more overall
airflow going down towards the card 75%
increased structural durability which
hopefully will mean that it breaks less
although they didn't break much already
so I guess that's good and 5% lower
total noise which I know might not sound
like a ton but it's actually a very
important metric and I know this isn't a
twin frozer 5 but I also wanted to show
off the new crate series components they
have a motherboard and a GPU in this
line and they're a cool kind of white
series I like seeing different colors of
boards and this will probably help
modders as you can see behind us this is
an exotic PC system all in white and it
utilizes both of these components quite
well alright guys thanks for watching if
you want to see all of our content from
CES this year be sure to say subscribe
