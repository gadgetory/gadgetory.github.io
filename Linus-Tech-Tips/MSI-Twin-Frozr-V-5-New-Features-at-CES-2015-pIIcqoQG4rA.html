brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
darn screen protectors out there as well
as hyperx welcome back to the msi sweet
well we will be discussing the twin
frozr 5 which funnily enough has five
new features on it first of all there's
the LED logo on kind of a top of the
card which is nice because this is
actually somewhere will you'll be seeing
these things a lot of times you'll see
really cool graphics or design on the
front of the card where the fans are
which you won't often see so it's nice
to be able to see stuff where this led
logo is after that we have the supersu
pipe which is basically just a giant
freakin heat pipe going to kind of
around the middle of the card in a
backwards S shape which should hopefully
help with cooling after that we have
zero frozer which might scare some of
you because one of the fans is not going
to spin under 50 degrees Celsius but
it's okay the cards fine once it gets
above 50 degrees Celsius both fans will
engage also there's the new gaming app
it's not afterburner it's kind of a more
simple casual style where there's three
different modes which will vary in
intensity of Clark speed and then in
turn heat and fan speed whatnot just to
keep your card cool but then if you want
to do something like be an awesome
spreadsheet man you don't necessarily
have to have your graphics card
massively overclocked so you can have it
in silent mode will be a lot quieter
last but not least we have their Torx
fan which sports nineteen percent more
overall airflow going down towards the
card seventy-five percent increased
structural durability which hopefully
will mean that it breaks less although
they didn't break much already so I
guess that's good and five percent lower
total noise which I know might not sound
like a ton but it's actually a very
important metric and I know this isn't a
twin frozr five but I also want to show
off the new crate series components they
have a motherboard and a GPU in this
line and there are cool kind of white
series I like seeing different colors of
boards and this will probably help
modders as you can see behind us this is
an exotic PC system all in white and it
utilizes both of these components quite
