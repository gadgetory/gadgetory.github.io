easy to find things to criticize and
it's easy to say no way man it's totally
worth the extra 20 bucks to get that
other one but some people will have
seventy-five dollars shipped in their
budget for a case period and they want
to know about products that cost that
amount does it have competitive features
how well-constructed is it is it
packaged well enough to survive a trip
across the state or country or whatever
by courier and is it simple to build in
but also with room to expand so what's
with those things in mind that I'll be
reviewing the Coolermaster n 600 kW and
one version an enthusiast friendly case
that can be obtained for as little as
seventy five bucks including shipping
after mail-in rebate the jazz mini phone
and tablet stand from Coolermaster is
now available in a variety of cool
colors from these great retailers click
now to learn more packaging wise I'd
prefer to see as much of the budget as
possible allocated to foam rather than a
full-color box but in this case the
middle-of-the-road stuff that they're
using here is probably fine even with a
system integrated into it so it's not a
huge issue the front of the chassis
holds three five and a quarter inch
drives and it's probably best described
as unoffensive it won't turn any heads
with its practical mostly mesh with a
faux brushed metal stripe front bezel
thing but I still think performance
minded customers will be happy because
the dual 120 millimeter fan outs behind
it will have basically unimpeded access
to fresh air front i/o is pretty
comprehensive with reset power for an
audio USB 2 and USB 3 ports as well as
an LED switch for the included
illuminated front fan then moving on to
the right hand side we find more
enthusiast friendly intake vents this
one has a 120 millimeter bracket behind
it that can actually be used to mount a
single cooling fan for the drive cages
or a dual 120 millimeter radiator giving
this case a total of 3 radiator mounts
that can be used at the same time while
still retaining full usability of one
SSD mount on the back of the motherboard
tray and the three three and a half inch
drive mounts in the front bottom but not
the adaptable two and a half or three
and a half inch drive bays
above those ones speaking of drive cages
the one on the back of the motherboard
tray is a bit tricky to screw in but
doesn't put unnecessary strain on the
connectors the resizable and removable
ones in the front are super handy but
perhaps a little bit unsightly with the
extra mounting points just kind of
hanging there but these on the bottom
permanent ones are extremely solid
better than cases I've seen that cost
twice as much it's just too bad I can't
say the same about the tooless plastic
drives LEDs some of which arrived bent
just from being tied together with a
rubber band the good news is that they
work great if you screw them in the rest
of the outside of this case is pretty
straight forward the left side panel has
a medium sized window that shows off
mostly just the good parts of the
hardware but also the SATA cables coming
out of the back of your hard drives
although the pragmatic part of me
acknowledges that there's a nearby cable
management hole and appreciates the
extra radiator mount that this cable
visibility enables the bottom has
plastic feed and a removable fan filter
that covers the power supply intake as
well as an optional 120 millimeter fan
mount the top has a filter for its dual
120 or 140 millimeter fan mounts and
finally at the back we've got seven PCI
slots a final pre-populated 120
millimeter fan mount and an integrated
fan controller with two simple settings
low and high it plugs in via molex and
handles up to two fans without splitters
nothing special but still a nice to have
around the back let's see what else
we've got there isn't a lot of space
between the motherboard tray and the
side panel so unless you're going to
obsessive-compulsive ly manage your
cables you might end up doing the old
push down and slide technique to close
up the panel but the good news is that
there is a little cubby in the bottom
left there for stashing extras if you're
not using a rad there and there are lots
of zip tie loops so if you really want
to do a good job at least coolermaster
provides the right tools
speaking of cable management the front
i/o cables are all black or sleeved and
they're all adequately or even amusingly
long this USB 3 cable for example looks
like it's designed to plug into the
system next to yours rather than inside
your own system still I'd rather they're
too long
to short the last note back here is that
the CPU cut out is only average size but
will work with almost any motherboard
and the motherboard tray
due to its anchor points on all sides is
surprisingly strong this is a sure sign
that a case designer has done this kind
of work before the motherboard tray is
actually quite important back around to
the front to the windowed side the cable
management grommets are made of the most
unexceptional rubber ever but I was
impressed to see them included at all in
a case of this price the extra auxiliary
PCI slot is a nice touch and I think
everything else here I've sort of
accidentally covered as I made my way
through the rest of the case so the
conclusion for this case actually
surprised me there's some stupid obvious
cost-saving measure stuff like the non
resealable bag for the included screws
and the fact that not all the
motherboard standoffs were pre-installed
but all in all it's actually a bit of a
wolf in sheep's clothing aside from the
side panel window an optional feature
and the obviously enthusiast oriented
ventilation holes on the top of the case
from the outside the an 600 looks like
it belongs sitting next to Joe in
accounting but based on the kind of
hardware you can cram inside such a
small enclosure I'll be it at the
expense of some cable management
convenience and other creature comforts
like noise isolating hard drive mounts
Joe from accounting could just as easily
be a hardcore enthusiast gamer freak I
mean you could easily pull out the top
removable drive bays chuck a pump and a
reservoir on that space fill up the
radiator spots and with all the filtered
intakes on this bad boy you could easily
pay me even a liquid-cooled CPU and dual
high-end graphics card setup in here so
the only thing left to say then is this
cooler master please stop putting glossy
plastic on things it's not a good accent
strategy sure it looks nice and photos
and for three seconds when I take it out
of the box but other than that it sucks
but the good news is that other than
that obviously very petty complaint I
don't think there are many criticisms I
can come up with for this case at full
price it's got some pretty stiff
competition but when it's on promo it's
actually pretty killer thanks for
