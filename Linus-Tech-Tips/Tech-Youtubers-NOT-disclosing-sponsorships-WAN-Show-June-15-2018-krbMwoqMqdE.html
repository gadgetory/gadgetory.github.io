bumping mm-hmm we'll see you people say
just waiting on to chat to stop pressing
you have to pay respect waiting on the
chat come on yeah yeah thanks twitch
chat welcome to the show
lioness is here - - hi guys I'm Linus
from maple ridge BC I enjoy socks
sandals and badminton annual employee
reviews and apparently camping - has
gone camping Jon's on the show this week
and we have a great show like every week
I don't even know if we have enough
topics to to call out in the intro
thingy but we do a bunch of tech
youtubers were accused of not disclosing
Computex sponsorships or being paid to
go to booths and all this other kind of
stuff
Jay from Jay's to sands has already
released a full video about this I know
a lot of people have been talking about
this on a lot of tech I'm not sure who
else did like a full-on video besides
Jay but I know that Paul and Kyle and I
think also some others at least
addressed it on Twitter yeah gamers
Nexus was talking about it as well like
a lot of you were talking about on
Twitter and then I know Jay made a full
dedicated video outside of that Imran
entirely sure but we'll talk about that
unsurprisingly everyone in the YouTube
tech review seen his friends so this got
slammed down pretty fast with a
collective effort of like what the f
that's bull poop anyways moving on we'll
talk about that more later there's a
rumor that an eight-core version of the
8700 K is coming this fall people are
thinking that they're just kind of Intel
it's just kind of reacting to AMD
because they don't really seem to have a
logical roadmap anymore but well we'll
talk about that later also AT&amp;amp;T closes
the time warner deal is this like
straight up like for suresies according
um so i your arms look huge your machine
I'm sorry he's off the camera yeah nick
is over here off camera flexing for us
and trying to distract us from the show
with his pythons but yes I talked about
this on tackling today
okay yes this deal is apparently final
so Wow the judge approved it like two
days ago and I think they were just sort
of chomping at the bit to get it done so
Wow okay mm-hmm
also we've got Apple is trying to stop
developers from sharing data on users
friends that sounds good
probably yeah I don't know a rumor that
the that there's an AMD Radeon rx 680
which like an expected price range of
like three to four hundred bucks and a
rumour that Windows 10 is going to run
on a Google pixel book which is pretty
weird but probably a good idea and we'll
talk about smash brothers ultimate
briefly open that may so yeah that's
gonna happen
oh yeah that's actually pretty sweet
okay there are no good topics today
interesting but yeah but then like
things that other people care about
other than me you won't care about this
do you want
that'll be pretty cool
yeah
oh right sponsors uh mas backpack savage
jerky and LTX oh or sponsoring or sellin
to ourselves it's amazing and set that
back and here we have so much ill-gotten
money according to this first topical
and talked about and we can get sponsor
ourselves yeah I think we're gonna bring
Nick on four so the first topic of the
day is going to be the tech youtubers
accused of not getting up okay yeah yeah
okay I'll just like stand in the back
terribly I'll do it I'll do a slab squat
in the back yeah well you're getting old
by the a microphone it's like youtubers
accused of not disclosing Computex
sponsorships so Nick had the great idea
of coming down as our business man to
directly address sure it's pretty simple
if we're paid by someone we we tell you
that's literally it
yes we visit sponsors booths yes we
create coverage of sponsors booths we
say that rate at the beginning of the
video at the end of the video we do not
charge an appearance fee just show up at
a booth brands reach out to us they say
we have interesting stuff and you should
check it out and we say okay sure we
might check it out and sometimes we do
and sometimes we don't and that's
literally how we do it so if you are
concerned that the content that you're
watching is paid for
just check the beginning of the video
and if it says this is sponsored by
so-and-so then yes and if it doesn't say
that then no and it also say that in the
in the video description so it's
literally that simple for for us yeah
that's it cool so we're into the point
yeah I'm gonna I don't know it's from my
perspective it's like I don't know it's
literally that simple if we're paid by
someone we say it and if we don't say it
then we're not paid by them to make that
content that's it yeah yeah cool and
I'll add some like more kind of
anecdotes but that's that's more or less
it I I think most people in the tech
review space do sort of the same deal I
can't think of anyone off top my head
who doesn't disclose sponsorships that
I've been able to notice but like if at
a lot of the shows that I've done it's
changed a little bit since I've been
doing
of shows but a lot of the shows that
I've done the majority of the videos
that come out of that show are not have
nothing to do with the sponsorship for
that show so like say say the Corsair
because they sponsored a bunch of shows
that I did in the past say Corsair is
sponsoring it okay that works one video
was at the Corsair suite they were a
sponsor of the show we said that it was
sponsored by them the other sponsor we
had was LastPass so 90% of the videos
were not about the sponsor comm 6 yeah
so so 9 out of 10 videos were not about
Corsair and oftentimes we'll have it
where like I'm gonna use Corsair again
I've done a show at PAX where Corsair
was the sponsor and I covered like three
or four competitors all positively and
that was fine and everyone was okay and
Corsair was happy and we were happy and
everyone else was happy and just my
experience with this which is like
obviously a lot limited than someone
like Luke but there's a couple of years
since I've been to on the show for the
company with CES but a big part of my
job when I was at CES at that year was
just go around and find interesting
stuff um
sponsorship money and he's no those
sorts of considerations had nothing to
do with I was doing it was just walk
around take notes if something is
interesting get some b-roll of it maybe
we can do a video on it that was
literally it there was never anything
shady exchanged in the background so
yeah yeah it'd be a bad idea for us to
is tying our hands as to what we can do
which makes no sense from a business
perspective so what would be more
intelligent taking some money now and
potentially losing the trust of viewers
or taking more money in the long
while maintaining the trust of yours and
partners like if you just think we're
all about money the smart choice is for
us to be honest about being then we have
long longevity and when you have a
company of 20 odd people I don't know
the exact number but somewhere around
there
and Linus metre group is indirectly kind
of propping up floatplane right now like
that's a lot of people and literally
companies to support you want a
long-term solution you don't want to
burst of money in a short period I think
when scandals or alleged scandals like
this pop up people tend to concentrate
on short term like oh we have evidence
of like this one deal that has this like
impressive dollar amount on it maybe
and that's office obviously like oh we
have evidence of a thing that may have
happened one time you know and that I
think gets eyeballs it gets clicks as
opposed to what you were just talking
about where oh we're trying to like make
as much as we can through like a
long-term review of things and what's
going to be sustainable for the long
term that isn't particularly interesting
to someone who wants to read about a
youtuber scandal and like most tech
youtubers that I know of that I've
watched their show coverage of do it in
generally the same way that we do I'm
not saying anyone's copying each other
I'm not getting into that that doesn't
matter but it's you go to the show you
do like your little right beginning the
video call out thank you for bringing me
to the show you make a video about
whatever happens to be there that'll
probably include one to two videos of
the company that brought you plus a
whole ton like the last show we were at
90% of the videos were from unrelated
companies and then at the end of the
video you often do another call out
thank you very mu Computex and then you
move on it's it's worked the same way
for like five years or something yeah
they will destroy everyone yeah yeah
yeah I know but it was important to
address because I know a lot of the
other tech guys have been really vocal
about this on Twitter and Jay made the
video and I don't think we've really
talked about it much we don't use the
window for that kind of stuff yeah yeah
okay thanks magic so yeah if you want if
you want a little bit more information
on stuff you can you can watch Jays
video I don't remember exactly what it's
titled but I think it's his second most
recent video give me one second it's
called the truth about how I earn money
and it's kind of cool cuz he goes into
more stuff than just shows he runs down
basically the like breadth of his
business he talked about the
merchandising line he talks about other
deals that he's done and how he's trying
to grow stuff like his personal branded
merch and whatnot it's a little bit like
the honest answer so yeah did about how
we make money although we're not
accusing Jay of like hulking us Frank
well no it's just a good it's a good
thing to do I think so yeah I think it
was a good it was really good timing and
a good idea of his day to do his now and
we did our as a while ago yes for what I
believe a similar reason I don't
remember or not I don't think there was
one big specific specific event I think
just there was a lot of fans working I
think there was law of toxicity like in
the comment sections of similar videos
but it's mean like that like the Intel
fans the AMD fans the Nvidia fans all
going at each other's and trying to say
oh here here's who which which company's
line is face the Nvidia show thing or
something like that I think yeah yeah
because I remember in that video we
talked about how like in videos given us
almost nothing we just make a lot of
videos about them because people like
their stuff Hugh the biggest player in
yeah GPS reso week and GPU videos do do
really well so yeah we have our honest
answers thing Jay has is truth about how
I make money I recommend watching both
of them I find them both very
interesting yes even art like I knew all
of ours already but even ours I think
was was quite good and yeah the fact
that gamers Nexus was included is
hilarious
because they just rip holes and
everything
they do so yeah like their their stuff
is like so technical and in-depth and
like if you know if if any youtuber is
gonna try to get away with that kind of
thing they would be they would have the
hardest road I'm getting away with it so
why no I don't know but anyways moving
on to a rumor love them rumors
we went from a rumor about us to a rumor
about a tech company this is wonderful
show so much less spicy though based on
hardcore definite facts
so anyways there's a rumor about an
eight-core version of an 8700 k that
could be coming this fall this is by
guru 3d and it was posted by racking off
on the forum I'm gonna post this into
the twitch chat real quick whoa what did
I just do what am i doing I wasn't
holding ctrl I see there we go but yeah
it's it's people are kind of speculating
that this isn't really this wasn't
really planned for oh that sucks
am I using the right thing and whether
or not it was planned for it does seem
quite reactionary maybe it was coming I
suspect even if it was coming it was
gonna be coming later than it did end up
coming I kind of think the truth is
probably somewhere in the middle as we
try to get our technical issues worked
out here huh yeah I'm gonna keep going
with that
yes I will okay so but yeah what I was
gonna say was um you know there's a
question here in front of me this Intel
even have their own roadmap anymore or
are they just being reactionary towards
what AMD is doing it might be a little
bit of both um because all of there we
go it's working out all of Intel's
difficulties trying to get a 10
nanometer chip to market have been very
very well documented right like oh what
are they going to originally release 10
nanometer like a year ago two years ago
something like that yeah yeah so so they
have to do something to keep innovating
clinical innovating in the meantime but
you know AMD did they force Intel's hand
here maybe a little bit I do think it's
really ironic that we're seeing so what
it's um how many years has been since
the FX series from AMD came out I
quite a while something like that so
it's so it's so ironic now I think that
Intel is reacting and trying to compete
with AMD just by strapping more cores
onto a CPU because an eight core i7 it's
not something we've seen on the
mainstream consumer end you had
originally or before you had to buy an
enthusiast platform and enthusiasm
motherboard to do that so but eight core
version apparently coming this fall no
pricing information on that yet but it's
interesting because you know obviously
it is gonna be the most cores we've ever
seen from intel on the consumer platform
but it's Sumeria but it is kind of funny
you know seeing is the big knock on AMD
for a long time was oh they're selling
these six and eight core CPUs but who
cares they're not really giving anyone a
benefit so yeah but aspect the thing was
especially back then with Intel having
so much of the market share no one was
able to develop for that reasonably so
now having AMD CPUs matter a lot more to
be completely honest and having Intel
have to react to that and pump out a
bunch of chorusing yeah I mean there's a
lot more cores across the field meaning
it'll make a lot more sense for
developers to push for it which would be
really cool because I don't know if you
guys remember this but I used to make
cores for gaming videos and I would do
like oh it's summer 2014 how many cores
do you need to game with and we stopped
after I made like three or four of them
cuz we were like well you could watch
any of these and get the answer because
it was the same thing every single time
so hopefully this will actually mix that
up definitely we can make another course
for gaming videos yeah you know and
obviously there's been development
challenges just with how you know the
stuff is actually coded to spread the
workload out load out among more cores
but you know there might be more effort
put into that now that what you were
saying there's just more cores out there
where you have a chip with 4 cores 8
threads or you know 6 and 12 is just a
more mainstream choice now so it's it's
you always have to have one obviously
the software or the hardware has to come
first
usually it's easier for the industry if
the hardware comes first
I know with certain games that have come
out and stuff it's been like wow
hardware really isn't ready for this yet
yeah like nothing can run this yeah yeah
exactly and then
that's usually a fairly uncomfortable
spot for the industry to be in it's fun
I enjoy that space but it's fairly
uncomfortable for consumers to be
constantly needing to replace all their
stuff to be able to do anything so
having the hardware first is good so
we're gonna get eight core out there and
get people used to it and have
developers start using it more often
that would be pretty sweet and awesome
absolutely it is it is a little bit of a
kick in the pants for people who
recently I know someone specifically who
like just bought a new processor that
being said this isn't coming until fall
so it would be a little while but like
the 8086 i7 8086 k like just came out
yeah it's pretty sweet but like if that
was like a nice little stunt for however
many weeks that ya ship to get but and
then I was like ah coming this fall
you've got an 8 core version 87 ok so
it's like it's like what if you like
spend a ton of money you buy a house and
then house has like trim or it's um
where the cabinets are a certain color
or certain style that was that was in
for like literally a month
yeah then everyone thinks it's ugly this
is yeah so we could bite the expensive
cpu it's a bit like that so yeah I
couldn't give two craps about cabinets
but I totally understand the reference
gotta get that resale value man it's
it's great when you walk into someone's
house who's been like perfectly
maintained done a really good job of
keeping their house up but they haven't
changed a single thing in it since like
the mid 90s they have like lurid pink
wallpaper look like a large yeah it's
actually so cool I just it's it's like a
time capsule okay
and moving on to something that I know
nothing about at all so good luck
AT&amp;amp;T closes the time warner deal this
sounds terrible to me I don't know I
don't know anything about it a federal
judge ruled on Tuesday that ATS eighty
five point four billion dollar bid for
Time Warner was legal imposing no
conditions on the merger all of this
despite a lawsuit from the Justice
Department arguing that the deal would
be anti-competitive and oh my goodness
how is it not I don't understand I can
tell you a little bit about that please
not me
a quick second before you do that here I
kind of bait and switch to you they're
working on the verge calm for our source
and thank you to Sherman tanker for
posting this on the forum
you're gonna go okay um so so when I was
in law school just a quick disclaimer I
didn't learn a ton about antitrust if
you watch like if you watch tech wiki
and the videos we've sort of done a like
law in tech a lot of it has to do with
intellectual property because I took a
lot of intellectual property in law
school so talking about copyrights and
like what you can do with content online
and how you can share and that sort of
thing but well here's why I can't tell
you about antitrust in just in case you
even know what antitrust is yeah
antitrust law basically concerns
companies that get too big the idea of
antitrust law was to prevent monopolies
is to prevent one company dominating the
marketplace for a certain thing you know
imagine if the only company out there
making Molly yours was LG for example
that wouldn't be good you would have no
choice and what you could buy so uh so
with this um what's happening is AT&amp;amp;T
which is obviously a huge
telecommunications company they run you
know back in the day that are most known
for running phone networks these days or
a huge ISP they just bought Time Warner
which includes I'm some really big like
media properties HBO CNN Warner Brothers
basically everything Warner Brothers
does is owned by Time Warner so what
this is called is called a vertical
merger and the reason is called a
vertical merger is because you have one
company buying another company that does
something different or more specifically
one company provides the other company
with with supplies or as a plot or
supply chain right so in this case Time
Warner is providing content they're
providing like I said they're um they
own HBO and CNN so they're providing
Game of Thrones or The Sopranos or The
Wolf Blitzer show or whatever people
watch on CNN I don't know what scene
anymore but um so and but you know AT&amp;amp;T
is the ISP so they're providing the
content that 18t can't deliver down
their pipes so that's what we mean by a
vertical merger there's also a
horizontal merger which is a little bit
simpler where one company buys another
company that does basically the same
thing imagine if UPS spots FedEx for
example right
be a horizontal work but so when when
the government so is that vertical
merger would be like you you buy
functionality and a horizontal merger
would almost be like you buy market
share yeah that's that's not a bad way
to put roughly yeah you're buying lunch
now you're buying supplies like yeah
help you somehow you know right so like
imagine if McDonald's like have their
own farms vertical integration yeah
Tesla has purchased a few like
manufacturing companies yeah and like
like companies that are into like tools
and manufacturing and whatnot so that
probably helps them vertically I'm not
sure exactly how to classify that
because I think um I think it was less
of manufacturing yeah yeah I'm not
exactly sure but anyway so um so so
specifically talking about this um so
the Justice Department of the u.s. took
ATT to court afraid that this would make
18th he too big there's like an
antitrust concern here with just way too
much market power but legally it is and
I was actually looking at the judge's
decision which is like 200 pages long
and full of legalese obviously earlier
but one key thing he mentioned was that
in a horizontal merger courts usually
have a little bit easier time deciding
you can just say oh you're buying
another company that does something
similar so let's just look at how much
market share you'll have now and if it's
too much market share we'll just say you
can't do this and it's easy a vertical
merger is a lot more difficult because
you're by a company that does something
else so these sorts of cases they tend
to be very fact-intensive there is very
case-by-case faced basis and just based
on that alone the government immediately
already had a tougher time proving his
case to go in front of a judge and
saying and say hey 18 he buying Time
Warner is gonna be really bad for
consumers um it wasn't good enough to
get the court to buy it and the judge
said get out and they let 18 to do the
merger and that's kind of it so so
people sing this in twitch chat and I
there's one kind of just says board
other than that dude that happens on
every every store we talk about though
I've someone said this into a chat and
I've read this before online and some in
the 80s or something they broke up AT&amp;amp;T
cuz it's too big yeah
and now they're letting them emerge and
become bigger the idea back then and
obviously you and I were both well what
you were you was not alive okay Luke
didn't exist and I was like tiny the a
is always born in 87 but um back in the
eighties before like everyone had the
Internet
AT&amp;amp;T ran a bunch of they provided don't
completely quote me on this but I think
what happened is they had both
long-distance and local um telephone
service and they just controlled so much
of the telephone market I know they were
a huge deal in telephone back yeah they
could just control so much the telephone
market and what ends up happening is the
US government broke up their local
operations into they call them the baby
bells and these were companies that were
spun off as independent but they serve
like different chunks geographical
chunks of the US but that's a little bit
different because we're talking about
the same thing as phone service this is
a little bit different because you have
an isp buying the folks who own HBO
right yeah it's a little bit different
ATT was divested in 1983 by the United
States government it had natural
monopoly over the communicate
telecommunication lines such as tell ya
exactly and they were the only group
based that's right so yeah that's quite
a bit different than it is now the baby
bells were stripped up into pieces
myself South Atlantic Bell etc they
slowly consolidated back into companies
like AT&amp;amp;T Verizon yeah that's right when
I was a kid or local or local phone
provider would spell south and they were
one of the x.18 companies so interesting
okay all right well moving on from that
just in case your hashtag bored
yeah and that dude in chat well it was
really funny because this happens right
as a net neutrality repeal it was a
thing so yeah so hopefully there won't
be fast lanes for Game of Thrones but I
guess if you're a game of Thrones
fanatic you'll be happy about that but
the most pirated show let's see how that
goes for them um
Apple tries to stop developers from
sharing use data on their users friends
this immediately sounds like a good
thing to me but I don't really know yet
it's supposed to by an over five on the
forum and the source we're gonna use is
Bloomberg Bloomberg comm how is your so
prou we use
Bloomberg is a because you turn on
Bloomberg TV there's always financial
stuff going on I don't even know
Bloomberg TV was the thing just seems
very Pro you know anyway it was a cool
name okay Apple Inc changed its App
Store rules last week to limit how
developers use information about iPhone
owners friends and other contacts
quietly closing a loophole that let app
makers store and share data without many
people's consent yay good thing thank
you Apple for closing a said loophole I
think that's kind of the gist of it I'm
gonna get this nice lady off the screen
cuz I don't know what she's actually
talking about and we're gonna go back to
here but yeah apparently many developers
asked users for access to their phones
contacts only use it for marketing or
sometimes or sometimes to share and sell
the information all without permission
from the people listed in those digital
address books that's the problem is that
your phone your address book those
people's information other companies
running apps are able to take that and
sell it whereas that's supposed to maybe
only be used for like sharing things or
seeing if you have other friends that
are online you know how some games you
can like import your address book and
then see if your friends are online
well they might sell that and that's bad
I feel like this is a GE PR thing or it
might be like they may have done this
responsibly or like I don't that's just
me speculating but it seems like the
timing seems like that might be why well
I think cuz it sounds like something
that will be absolutely not allowed by
the gdpr yeah where your data is getting
used and you have no idea what's going
on with it I just think in this case
both companies might be a fault yes so I
think apples trying to close their end
but there's also a problem for app
developers they would both be in trouble
or that law for Apple for not like
securing the data and passing it on and
then the app developers were using it
without permission so so apples probably
just taking care of that definitely
needs to be taken care of the new App
Store review guidelines bar developers
sorry the new App Store review
guidelines bar developers from making
databases of ad
book information they gather from iPhone
users sharing and selling that database
with third parties is now forbidden
probably should have been already but
whatever an app can't get a users
contact list say it's being used for one
thing and then use it again for
something else unless the developer gets
consent again obviously this can still
be abused but I think it's a vector for
Apple to rip you off the app store so if
they catch you doing this you'll get
you'll get tossed right anyone yeah
anyone caught breaking the rules may be
banned this sounds like an extremely
easy rule to break and probably not that
hard of a rule to get away with breaking
but at least they have it written out
now but they can give you the boot if
you do break it when users like like
honestly it did yeah no it does this
whole thing reminds he wasn't laughing a
little bit is of in Android PE I think
they took away the ability for apps to
use your camera microphone in the
background which was cool but I was like
what were they doing before yeah like
what were you like all the time before
Android II yeah yeah when users install
apps and then consent developers get
dozens of potential data points on
people's friends contact listen to
contain phone numbers email addresses
profile photos and tons of other stuff
as you probably know
so that database of information is
probably quite valuable so now what
they'll probably have to do is sell it
to themselves as another company and
then anonymize the data and sell it that
way
so that'll add one more loop that they
have to jump through for Apple to not be
able to catch them so alright at least
Apple has cleaned their hands but this
will still remain an issue just in case
anyone was wondering moving on I just
sort of assumed that everyone on the
internet just knows everything about me
yeah ease your way to live yeah yeah
another rumor because this show again is
only about things that are confirmed
100% true rumor AMD Radeon rx 680 the
Radeon rx 680 will reportedly be powered
by the Navi GPU architecture and will
feature eight gigabytes of gddr5 to Nate
CI or so an expected price range of 300
to 400 bucks that's actually really good
looking at the stories about what and
Vidya is gonna be allegedly because like
you said this these are all one her
percent confirm facts in the show of the
show but um yeah but anyway um seriously
there was everyone saying or lot people
are saying July thirtieth for the what's
Thea code name for the next nut bolt uh
but it's um Oh what shad cuz right
screaming at me with it right now I was
writing about this earlier today and
I've already forgotten it NVIDIA Road
map
what is your think all nope that's old
just search that's full hold on I'll get
it year old on twitch a streaming at me
right now I'm sure touring touring
touring touring like like oh yeah
touring your ampere so here was the one
I hadn't man so they're supposed to be
released in snorkel they're supposed to
be releasing touring at be end of July
but it's just gonna be the higher end
silicon to begin with as is tradition
you know yeah so I the rumor is that the
the high end card will cost between a
thousand and fifteen her depending on
how much of VRAM you get with it so
something like this could be really
appealing if you can say oh well I don't
have a thousand dollars but I can spend
three hundred fifty bucks on something
with 1080 light performance so yeah
someone in chat said please please
please make this square bracket anecdote
poopy for mining and great for gaming
doubt it eight gigs of DDR six should
probably be pretty smoking for mining
well I mean I don't I don't know if you
can you know really make a card like
that you know what I mean cuz memory is
super important for mining oh yeah I
know but my point is just more like if
he's worried about price yeah looks like
it will be affordable because obviously
there was this huge artificial inflation
with the pricing we'll have to see like
immediately after this card comes out a
bunch of miners gonna get their hands on
of it on on of it a bunch of miners will
get their hands on it
we're going slow today it's been like a
long yeah
has been a long week so we'll see how it
goes but looking at its price point
looking at its performance this could be
a big card for mining but mining isn't
all super hype right now yeah so maybe
it'll be okay yeah things change quickly
yeah like a couple months ago it was a
completely different story and also this
is an interesting side note Andy will
release a navi 20 on 7 nanometer as a
high end GPU in the 2020 to 2021
timeframe oh boy so seven nanometer GPU
from AMD so keep your eyes out for that
they're smashing it man it's cool I'm
happy for them speaking of happy savage
jerky I have a new favorite it's mellow
jalapeno that's how I narrowed my friend
oh oh well that was habanero sorry no
doubt the other one do we have another
thing over there this is habanero I'm
very sorry
it is no whole jalapeno I can't I was
like holy cow I'm slow today
no I voted a anyway we have the sponsor
but this is my new favorite one I
haven't had it before Moho is my like
was my like my main squeeze before but
now I've got some oh-ho jalapeno in my
life and I I like it very much is there
any one of these you like would you want
one absolutely
oh my goodness sriracha bacon done this
is more Act there you go oh my goodness
perfect sriracha bacon in case I prefer
they're straight out you want Eve jerky
they're both really good they are really
growth very very good I've to be fair
anyone who has the like bacon flavors I
prefer the beef jerky ones oh okay so
it's not a preference yeah yeah yeah
it's it's not a savage jerky so whether
so whether you like dead pig or dead cow
savage jerky will have something for you
guy you covered especially if you want
some jalapeno um you guys know these
guys as of now like the least surprising
sponsor spot ever yeah I be savage your
key is to the wine show as FreshBooks is
to tech will key by this point pretty
much um
their drink is made with great
ingredients no nitrates no preservatives
they've got 13 different types of jerky
13 different flavors of jerky I should
say people seem to love this ratchet
bacon I'm super not surprised that John
grab that one Mabel buffalo bacon is
also super popular they also make
barbecue sauce hot sauce and spice rubs
they also have Carolina Reaper hot sauce
which is the world's hottest pepper yes
it's not the world's hottest hot sauce
so you can actually like eat it and it's
fine but it is made with the world's
hottest pepper which is pretty insane
they even got an awesome savage jerky
gift tool bag that's really good yeah
which includes four packs of jerky hot
sauce herb blend or spice rub and it
makes an awesome gift I've never want to
bring up a picture of it yeah give me a
sec mm-hmm savage jerky tool bag is
pronounced with the agent in herb a
Canadian thing a lot of Americans just
British thing I think Canadians flip it
back and forth interesting because herb
and herb both sound perfectly fine to me
there we go because Canadians are weird
the morning oh here it is
what the heck that's a but you get a
husky toolbag uh-huh
a straight-up husky toe bag is included
okay I was expecting that was gonna be
like kind of a fake oh part of it but it
is not you get four bags of jerky one
bottle of hot sauce one bottle of herb
herb blend or spice rub one savage jerky
koozie I've screwed that up before I
think it's called it a kazoo oh but it's
a koozie it's great and too savage jerky
Snickers that's actually pretty cool and
this isn't in my notes but I always warn
people when there's certain special
dates coming up on my Twitter but I'll
do a wham show warning here it's
Father's Day on Sunday so if you need
something and they can get it to you
fast enough I don't know what they're
shipping speed is but this might be a
decent idea jumping back to other
sponsors let's do
right and sorry savage jerky but the the
link over here
savage jerky calm use offer code LTTE
save 10% so you can save money on the on
the tool bag if you want to get that or
you can just buy some buy some bacon and
save money on it saving money on bacon
is always a good thing hmm
and moving on we have moss backpacks I
love these bags and I do the same thing
every time because it just makes me
super happy but all of their bags have
this really bright orange inside and
it's lovely how well it shows up on
camera too because it's just awesome and
it really proves my point it's extremely
easy to find stuff in here let's let's
grab Moe whole jalapeno it even has
orange on it it's still gonna be super
easy to find crossbar anything look it's
right there look how easy that is it's a
black package in a bag that's often
really really hard to find because most
people make their bags with with black
inside it's like a small touch it makes
a big difference you know it really does
I have a backpack that has an orange
inside and I will never ever go back it
also has the like the airport or zippers
so you can lay your bag out like that
really easy so you can get through
everything super wide open it's got nice
little like mesh things you have a
bottle in there or some cards or
whatever it has a little card that
explains how you can use it if you don't
want to listen to me
and I like this too you guys aren't
gonna be able to see this very well but
in the thin top zipper you know how a
lot of bags will have like the the small
zipper at the top this one right here if
you open that up the pocket inside is
like a reinforced area it's not I don't
think it's plastic or anything and it's
covered in like a felt like material I
probably called it wrong I'm not very
good at identifying materials but it's a
very soft type of material that's on top
of some formed cup like shape so if you
put something in there that's relatively
fragile and you have big stuff in here
that whacks into it it'll be okay
because the cup thing is going to keep
its shape and project protect whatever
you put inside that's actually kind of
cool that's a good idea I haven't really
seen that in a lot of bags before
we're showing off their other one as
well if you want this is the black pack
if you want a different type of bag one
thing that I really like about these
guys too is they'll have on different
bags they'll have this guy can I pull
this out uh-huh
it's a wall plug why do you need a wall
plug for your backpack well it's and it
nicely tucks on the side of the bag as
well so you don't even have to open up
your bag to get ax or you don't have to
open up the main compartments of your
bag to get access to it that wall plug
is for this this has a standard plugs
you plug your laptop or something into
it it has two USB ports one of them is
already plugged in because the cable
feeds through to the front of the case
but you could unplug it put whatever you
want in there the cable that comes with
it is actually nice reinforced with a
spring so that the cable isn't gonna
like get damaged in your bag which makes
sense because it's gonna stay in your
back I don't know I think that's
wonderful because you could just get
home plug your bag into the wall and it
automatically charges everything that's
a when you're out the airport you just
wanna charge all your stuff at once boom
yes someone tweeted me after the last
maus backpack sponsorship talking about
like oh that's just expecting trouble
because someone's gonna plug it into the
wall and walk away from it and it's
gonna get determined as a bomb just
don't don't walk away from your don't
walk away from it like most the plugs
and airports that people design these
airports generally know that people want
to charge their stuff so most of the
plugs are near seats have a sit do
whatever you need to do if you want to
go get some food or go to the washroom
unplug take your backpack with you like
you'd normally would so that people
don't think it's a bomb in an airport
that's like they say over the
loudspeakers the whole time
do not leave luggage unattended it is
still luggage despite having a plug that
was well I was going to say like I'm
pretty sure they would treat it an
unattended bag as suspicious even if
there were warrant a cable sticking out
of it yeah like it doesn't matter so
yeah yeah so that has nothing to do with
anything
great backpacks I love the plug feature
I love the orange I love the cup thing
that they're doing but yeah check it out
at the link below if you are on youtube
or just check them out on Kickstarter if
you look
backpacks on Kickstarter Kickstarter
interesting and should be good to go I
think they're doing another campaigns
these guys definitely have had laptop so
before I personally know someone who has
bought them off of their website so I'm
assuming it's a it's a new thingy
they're doing on on Kickstarter I'm like
I'm assuming that's the black pack with
their Kickstarter Inc anyways beyond
there we have LTX LTX expo if you want
to come visit the team meet the team
meet me even though I'm not on the team
hoho that makes sense
come to LTX it's only need up an
interactive tech event the interactive
part here is important I feel like it
always takes away I feel like we need to
get like testimonials from people that
go next time so we can play this just an
event about passive absorption yeah
thing I feel like it takes a little bit
away from it because it's an event we
are holding and I'm the one talking
about it but LTX is legitimately one of
the coolest events I've been to I've
only been to one because there's only
been one but the interactive part is
super cool because you go to these
conventions and when I went to
conventions when I was younger they were
a little bit more grungy a little bit
less planned out and there was a little
bit more hand on action because like I
remember pax when I first went there
they just be Hocking prizes out of the
booths there'd be more hands-on stuff
because the smaller con it was a smaller
con they were just worried about things
then they started getting in trouble for
different stuff and they had to close it
down we are keeping that in mind we
don't want to get in trouble for stuff
but we're keeping all the booths
interactive so like one of the really
cool things that's coming this year is
how to do D lid your CPU so you can
bring a CPU and you'll have professional
people showing you how to deal it it in
person where else can you get that I
literally think no we're really cool
every single booth is going to have some
type of interactive setup with it
current booths include a blind cable
management competition brought to you by
cable Mod ad lidding workshops you can
bring your CPUs and I'll show you how I
deal it it case toss 2.0 hope I'll do
better than I did
multi-headed VRA 20 PC land brought to
you by iBUYPOWER the 12k ultra wide
gaming setup and tons
tons more I guarantee there will be tons
more there is already tons where I don't
know why it's not listed here probably
just cuz it'll be way too much to say
there's also gonna be fooling hold music
cool systems to look at more room more
swag and more special guests than last
year there will be exclusive live
unboxings just like last year and more
you can come hang out with us the ticket
start at $35 Canadian and you can check
them out through the link below or
because you're watching on twitch right
now get or unless you're watching this
later
that's I said right now and that's
relative so if you're watching it at
5:49 Pacific time yeah on on Friday then
the link is just LTX Expo calm but if
not link below it's only 26 50 USD for
our American viewers it's nothing
yeah it's not it's not that expensive
and it's a really fun convention I want
people to go I want people to go because
I want to keep doing it because it's
it's literally last year's was more fun
for me than last year's packs was and
I've been doing a pack since hose
yeah the last term's LLC X was very
enjoyable I it was a real hard percent
with that even like as an attendee I'm
gonna be 100% honest here I didn't
invite most of my like personal friends
to LTX here yeah because I was like it's
probably just gonna be a fan meetup
there's gonna be a few things to do but
it's really mostly gonna be a fan meetup
and then I was like holy crap I feel
pretty bad cuz it was really fun and
none of the none of them came so I
didn't invite them so rekt but they're
invited this year because it won't be
good moving back to normal news whoop
wrong screen yeah stop beating that
savage jerky man it's so good nope keep
going who cares okay it's your bag as
far as I'm concerned that's true
you don't have to stop uh let's move on
new iOS security feature has already
been bypassed whoo boy this was posted
by Captain to fire on the forum and our
source is the forum but yeah iOS 12
introduces a new USB restricted mode
that makes it harder for law enforcement
agencies to thwart iPhone security USB
restricted mode requires that an iPhone
be unlocked with a passable with a
passcode when connected to a computer
via USB if the device has not already
been unlocked in the last hour Wow
meaning phone hacking and forensic tools
shouldn't be able to unlock phones in an
email obtained by vice a forensic expert
claims that gray shift has already
defeated Apple's new USB restricted mode
in a beta build USB restricted mode is
currently in beta testing and will
launch to the public soon
according to Apple it's this big like
cat-and-mouse game between an asshole
and the government yeah and this is just
the latest chapter of that there was
some and there was some District
Attorney down in Louisiana who was
saying that Apple was literally
promoting criminal activity by doing
this and I'm just sitting here like if
you won't people to take you seriously
and be on your side maybe don't say
things like that but regardless of how
you feel about it this the fact that's
already been defeated is a little bit
humorous to me just because like I said
there was just constant arms race
between it's like Apple and these um
these law enforcement folks who cuz the
FBI has been lobbying for years and
years to try to force Apple to have a
backdoor into their products if they
want to do an investigation so yeah I
think it could have something to do with
the baten s of the bill because they
they beat it on the beta possibly um and
we have had security firms lie about
beating apples security before mm-hmm
eventually they've kind of figured it
out but they've they've lied in there
what do we know about gracious who knows
off the top of my head not a ton I've
heard of them before great shift they
cellphone unlocking services great shift
iPhone unlocker mysterious $15,000 gray
key promises to unlock iphone x4
whatever yeah they're there a phone
unlocking thing I've heard of them
before I just wasn't sure to be fair if
it's that I'm starting to remember a
little bit more about them now if it's
them they probably did it
oh so rekt I guess
yeah oh well we'll see if it holds
through with the beta but even if it
doesn't when you've got groups like grey
shifts constantly consistently going
after your stuff and making a profit on
it in a government-sanctioned way you're
probably boned yeah you because you have
an incentive especially everything jakab
all right so like at some point yeah
that sucks Microsoft to help Walmart get
rid of cashiers
oh my Microsoft is reportedly working on
this was posted by no one
maybe but our sources are Technica com
Microsoft is reportedly working on
technology that removes the need for
cashiers and check-out lines in store is
similar to Amazon's technology already
implemented in its Amazon go
brick-and-mortar store so Microsoft is
essentially doing the same thing as them
the exact technology isn't explained but
it may be linked to the company's new
Kinect for a sewer project this project
builds on connects current abilities and
can be used to execute spatial mapping
and motion tracking well it's unclear
how far along Microsoft is in developing
this technology the company has
reportedly shown sample tech to
potential partners and has even talked
to Walmart about implementing it
directly Amazon is expected to open new
go locations in Chicago and San
Francisco soon Microsoft is making
interesting moves this is a big deal to
me because yes because ok so Amazon go
they're putting the technology they have
one store in Seattle buying two more ok
and they're gonna put in Whole Foods
right I mean they're I mean they're all
as big as Walmart but they're a big
chain this to me it's like Microsoft a
well I'll see your little dinky
operation at Whole Foods and I'll raise
you Walmart you know so we're talking
about like the biggest retailer in the
US and Microsoft is trying to it just it
looks almost like Amazon's trying to
like own the full stack essentially like
they want the store they want the
technology in the store they want
everything and Microsoft is like no we
don't need everything we just want to
have this well see if they can do it cuz
I think the challenge here is that
Microsoft sort of cloud processing
processing capability it's not quite as
big
a mythologies with AWS so we'll see how
that works out for them yeah that's
quite interesting huh well we'll see
though because Microsoft buying github
and making this move right now is
probably what the kind of stuff that
they need to do I don't know if it's
best for consumer interest but if I'm
just thinking about this from a
Microsoft point of view this is the kind
of stuff that they need to do they were
they were early with the whole Windows
thing they were early and on the ball
with technology back then then they
tried for quite a while with different
hardware stuff obviously Xbox was quite
successful but outside of that Windows
Phone Zune okay Zune was amazing well
the product may have been good but it
just didn't catch on in the marketplace
or - yeah so Zune music software was
sweet yeah soon itself was amazing it
just didn't it didn't they were just
like to the party they're just late to
the party coz by the time Zoo like was
like really you know B people started
reviewing positively like oh I pod was
already a thing so yeah yeah yeah I wish
I do really wish that Zune kind of took
off but it didn't so I feel like
everyone is pivoting their business a
little bit these days it's like it's
like every large firm is doing it to
some degree it makes sense qalaat of the
guys have been doing the same thing for
a long time speaking of Microsoft steam
is dropping Windows XP and Vista support
in 2019
this was posted by sc2 Mitch on the
forum again we always have one from him
it's there starting on January 1st 2019
steam will officially stop supporting
the Windows XP and Windows Vista
operating supposed to have to pay
respects this means that after that date
the Steam client will no longer run on
those versions of Windows I suspect it's
just not getting updates they could lock
out access to the steams they could
because it's essentially a breath
they're going to but they could so the
newest features in steam rely on an
embedded version of Google Chrome which
no longer functions on older versions of
Windows yeah so I don't think you'll get
updates for the remainder of 2018 steam
will continue to run and launch on
Windows XP and Windows Vista but other
functionality and steam will be somewhat
new features such as the steamed chat
will not be available I don't know if
people running those systems will care
so we'll see Gmail can remind you to
reply that's actually super cool as part
of its new design gmail has started
resurfacing old unanswered emails with a
suggestion that you should reply by
bumping the email thread to the top of
your inbox Gmail also breaks the
chronological order of your inbox which
is kind of poo but you can probably
disable this Gmail lets you disable all
smart features a very next note some
users don't want smart categories
important emails first and smart reply
suggestions you can tick off the boxes
to just emails to reply to and suggest
emails to follow up on if you don't want
to see this orange text ever again I do
want to see it personally so I'm gonna
leave that there this is me spitballing
um I'm but I'm guessing they probably
integrated like the UM the priority
feature you don't like work more certain
things so they use yeah cuz cuz you
would hate you would hate you know for
it to tell you to Paulo to email hey
walmart.com say sale you know save 50%
on paper towels you know and you
wouldn't we get nags to reply to that
but yeah so someone in chat said Steam
did a hardware survey a while back they
probably saw it wasn't worthwhile to
continue support yeah I recently checked
it out because I was I was having a bad
day and I was really frustrated with the
fact that my stream deck from El Gato
didn't work on when I was 8.1 and it
would like it hurts my brain that that
doesn't work and it's so confusing
because it's actually a pretty sweet
piece of tech and like alternatives that
actually do all of the same things are
way more expensive in in most cases and
alternatives that do almost the same
thing
well they don't they don't do quite the
same way they'll news yeah and it's not
even that I need it mm-hmm I don't I
could just use a MIDI controller but I
like it's cool it's nice and small the
buttons are all framed you can change
what this shows on the screen it's a
really cool device and it only works in
Windows 10 doesn't make any freaking
sense to me and what drill
mean nuts was because people have a
hacked it and forced it to work on other
operating citizens by checking by just
all they did in the one case was they
took out the check that checks if you're
on Windows 10
and it just works it doesn't work
anymore
they updated it and now it doesn't work
but it did for a little while and I
can't find what's the rationale to stop
them from working on Windows a1 I I
haven't got what I think of as a
satisfactory answer I'm sure there's
something what they've been saying is
it's just too much to support but what
drove me nuts about that was that just
taking the flag out made it work but
then technically they have updated it
since then and it doesn't work anymore I
doubt they forced that guys hack to not
work so they probably just used
something that doesn't work on previous
versions of Windows and now it doesn't
work it's just the thing that drives me
nuts is I looked into the steam hardware
survey and all the people not using
Windows 10 is a pretty huge market share
and I can't imagine that it wouldn't be
worth the dev work to have that
available market share now something
that they may have done in terms of
market research is looking at well the
people that aren't using Windows 10 are
they willing to buy it maybe they're not
using Windows 10 because they don't have
the money to have a newer computer
that's possible I don't see the merit in
that but that could be what Elgato
seeing I wonder if it has to do anything
with just some sort of cya kind of
security thing where they're just saying
oh well it's an older version of Windows
it's just kind of less secure by default
and we don't want to be blamed if
something goes wrong with our product
because they're running like an older
version of Windows it could be a simple
was at so who knows yeah
someone said it was free to upgrade yeah
but some people with like I'm talking
yeah some people no that's a good point
I don't know I don't know what their
reasoning is I I can't understand it
doesn't make any sense to me but anyways
I was looking up steam hardware surveys
to try to justify my rage because I
really
really really want this thing to work
but I cannot use Windows 10 because I
will rip my eyes out so anyways I can't
use the freaking stream deck because I
can't find the executable for the
version that works with just the flag
taken away I can find I can
github download they'll like hack that
removes the flag that's fine I can't
find the executable for the Installer
that works that way and I don't care
about whatever new updates they have it
doesn't matter to me at all so yeah
anyways that's why I've seen ya there's
basically no one running XP and Vista
and steam anymore
morale this story erielle because I
looked up the steam hardware surveys and
yeah it's a pretty small percentage so
when the chat said Windows 10 is fifty
five point five percent Windows seven is
thirty three point five seven percent
Windows 8.1 is only four point zero
seven percent yeah that's fine my thing
is if they make it work for Windows 7
which is thirty three point six
essentially percent of the audience
which is a huge percentage it will work
for eight point one it will it or it'll
be one of the situations where we can
just remove the flag of them saying that
it won't work for eight point one and
it'll install just fine I'm not trying
to say that everyone uses Windows 8.1 I
realize I'm in a very small category
there but Windows seven is huge and I
want to lean on that to be able to get
support for older versions of Windows
that will essentially include Windows
8.1 yeah because 7 to 8.1 compatibility
is like very good going to Moore's a
little bit more to stretch though so
yeah yep yeah anyways that's it for the
wine show oh is that it yeah I think so
there's no other topics Super Smash
Brothers is going to have 65 characters
for switch is that not in here
I'm looking right at it why did I not
see it what other news did I miss that's
basically it though okay yeah I'm gonna
just scrolled right over it yeah it's a
bajillion characters I think they said
every everyone's ever fought in a smash
game is in this game okay
is it true though because I saw people
talking about why Luigi was wild Luigi
ever in a smash game
I don't know maybe it's a trophy I don't
know if you could actually select him to
fight though I forget whoa
motherboard vice.com has a counterpoint
FY luigi he doesn't deserve to be in the
new smash bros that's a little
aggressive guys yeah he's kind of an
irritating character I think he might
have a point
oh my goodness it's uh yeah so everyone
that's in Super Smash Bros ultimate
except for why Luigi essentially while
Luigi missing from Super Smash Bros
ultimate I don't care someone might care
maybe he was left out intentionally
maybe maybe he'll be DLC could you
imagine I could just imagine the storm
that would happen if they had like the
waluigi dlc yeah they'll be really funny
this'll be great yeah cost sixty bucks
so there there is a new score counter
that pops up during one-on-one fights
when anybody is Kayode each fighter has
gotten some kind of graphical tweak to
some degree which makes sense there's
two new playable characters Ridley the
alien pterodactyl boss from the Metroid
series and Inklings the squid kids from
splatoon they were already in Mario Kart
you just added them to these national so
I don't know if yeah anyways fighters
must now choose their battleground stage
before picking a character that's
different it's always the other way
around right yeah that's weird
that actually makes sense it says due to
professional players favoring certain
stages for certain characters yeah okay
let make sense a picture-in-picture
preview window when any combatant when
any Kamiya when any combatant is
launched off the screen that also makes
sense to me but yeah apparently it will
launch on a nintendo switch on December
7th 2018 cool just in time for Christmas
sounds like I'll be getting yet another
game for my switch on December 7th 2018
they should have releases on Black
Friday just to see the meltdown oh I'm
really happy they didn't just like just
like the parking lot but weapons yeah
yeah yeah I would love to see that
Hyrule Fight Club 24/7 pretty much
roecastle is the is the is the only map
for me boy but yeah anyways that's
actually it for winch oh well that was
probably loud sorry headphones and we'll
see you next week when your ears stop
bleeding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
