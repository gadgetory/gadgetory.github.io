brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries crazy things you're
announcing here at the show or talking
about here at the show we got World of
Warplanes which we have a separate video
with you about and World of Tanks xbox
360 edition what did you guys do to
bring the World of Tanks experience to
the console you know we did a lot
actually in the first thing that's
really important is that the game is not
a port we didn't just take the pc
version and figure out how to squeeze it
onto a console the game is built
completely from the ground up by our
studio in chicago wargaming West
formerly day 1 studios if you know about
sort of their pedigree in their
experience in the gaming industry and
you know the game is really built
specifically for the 360 we spin up the
pace a little bits of Tanks move a
little bit faster the action unfolds a
little bit quicker and we did things
also like taking the progression system
of researching new tanks unlocking new
tanks and made that a little bit quicker
too because compared to the pc version
console gamers are different you know we
just didn't want to take the pc version
put it on the console and hope people
liked it we really wanted to fine-tune
the game for those console gamers in
mind well I think both PC gamers and
console gamers are going to appreciate
that because pc gamers hate having
something as simple as how many key
bindings they can have or how the UI is
structured they hate seeing a console
version because they're sitting right in
front of their computer so you guys have
completely redesigned the UI as well
yeah we totally have you know like you
mentioned on the pc world of tanks
you're sitting in front of a monitor
that's maybe a foot away from your face
so looking at all the UI and all the
visual options it's easy on the 360
you're probably six to eight feet away
from a TV on your couch so the
development team really completely
redesigned and overhauled how the UI
looks and where all the different
elements are on the screen and then on
the control side to obviously taking a
game that's keyboard and mouse they've
done a great job of really condensing
everything onto the controller for the
360 and really losing no accessibility
and no auction in the process now it's
going to be a different game obviously
so cross-platform play is just not a
thing what were the challenges I
honestly yeah unfortunately there's no
cross-platform play Microsoft has a very
specific infrastructure in terms of how
its data centers and servers work for
multiplayer and things like that so
we just couldn't get it to work out but
honestly you know we look at going to
the 360 not as really that is really an
attempt to get pc players to go to
console or vice versa you know they've
got like 80 million plus 360 s out there
they've got 48 million live subscribers
for the 360 so for us it's it's a great
opportunity to really get world of tanks
in front of a completely new audience
that maybe knows about us or never even
heard about us or never played our games
so new audience new game same business
model you're still not charging for the
game so how does it work then how do you
get access how do you play World of
Tanks xbox 360 so the game is actually
it's free to play for gold so if you're
gold subscriber on Xbox Live you
download the client you're in if you're
a level below it's a silver you're going
to get a seven day time trial after that
seven days expires you're gonna have to
upgrade but like you said before you if
your gold it's free to play we're going
to have ingame purchases just like we
did on World of Tanks for pc the economy
and the pricing is pretty much gonna be
exactly to scale is that at the pc
version so the in-game items are like
the pc i mean you guys have this
philosophy sort of across the board but
is there going to be a competitive
advantage really to buying in-game items
know and you know that philosophy said
we call it free to win and the really
the basis of it is that what we want is
with your pain player or non paying
player you can go into our game and have
an equal experience so yeah none of our
in-game purchases give you an advantage
in battle we want it to be about skill a
lot of the things that we sell are based
on convenience or personalization and
customization so we have consumables
things like repair kits first aid kits
skins for your tanks emblems for your
tanks but nothing that's going to make
you better than another player and again
that's all that skill tell me when
you're launching and tell me what you're
going to have available at lunch sure so
right now the game is in beta and North
America so that's the US and canada and
last week we also announced the launch
of the beta in europe the game is going
to be out this year we don't have a firm
release date yet but it will launch with
about 70 tanks for the US and German
lines and then after that we have a very
very aggressive schedule for
downloadable content new modes new maps
new nations new tanks all of that stuff
that's really made the pc version of
World of Tanks such a success we're
going to totally do the same stuff on
three
60 that sounds fantastic so thank you
Chris for taking the time to hang out
with us yeah it's been a pleasure thank
you and guys just a reminder our
sponsors here at the show our Western
Digital Intel and steel series huge
thanks to them for allowing us to be
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
