Windows Phone with the HTC 8x for a
month to see if the platform could woo
me away from iOS for blog videos and a
month later the answer was a definite no
but Windows Phone has had a lot of time
to mature so when HTC reached out about
the One m8 for Windows running the
latest 8.1 version featuring Cortana
voice control I jumped at the
opportunity to review it coolermaster
v-series semi modular power supplies
feature 80 plus gold efficiency and
their gold guarantee five-year warranty
click now to learn more we'll kick
things off positively hardware-wise HTC
didn't change much but i don't really
feel like they had to I love this phone
it's the one on eight man it's got a
fast CPU ample RAM enough storage on
board with microSD expansion if you need
more front facing beam sound speakers
their ultra pixel camera with a two-tone
flash that is designed to perform best
in low-light scenarios and finally that
wonderful glass and aluminum 1m Series
build quality that is second to none
anyway if you want to know more about
the hardware you should check out our
original One m8 review where I basically
say it's awesome this video is more
about the software after that Windows
Phone has some advantages it runs
extraordinarily well on relatively low
end hardware mind you so does Android
these days it's a tiled display and
navigation animations are eye-catching
and beautiful mind you what isn't these
days and finally it works really well
with Windows services like Office Mobile
onedrive and Skype but what doesn't
these days ok so both weren't really
advantages at all then were they this is
going to be a rough video setup was easy
I imported my accounts and settings from
my old 8x in just a couple minutes also
Google account 2-step validation is
super easy to deal with now and doesn't
require app specific passwords that's
good but once I landed on the desktop
with its live tiles shoot I don't really
know where to begin just like last time
around I started by trying to find
equivalents for the essential apps that
I use every day and it's a real chore
the first party Facebook and Twitter
apps are pretty good
Instagram has a very functional beta
speedtest.net Flixter and whatsapp all
worked fine Plex is available but I'm
not paying five dollars for it again so
I can't comment on how good that one is
and Dropbox and so no services are
enabled through third-party apps that
have some but not all of the
functionality and ease of use of the
official ones on other platforms which
leads us to the stuff that's missing
Google stuff is a nightmare
so kiss goodbye stuff like the YouTube
studio creator app and hangouts and
while Google Play Music has a
third-party app this very amusing review
the developer left on his own app really
highlights the issues with relying on
these when the api's can change
overnight just like that and then in no
particular order here's some other stuff
that I use every day without suitable
replacements harmony remote control drop
cam replacement keyboards such as Swift
key I mean even Apple is going to start
allowing third-party keyboards in iOS 8
come on Microsoft speaking of which
scan apps the only things labeled Swift
key in the Windows Phone store are
straight-up scams one of which has been
there for over a month without being
cleaned up for shame Microsoft which I
guess leads to a discussion about the
stock keyboard it's text prediction is
accurate but slow
I felt like oftentimes it was missing
keystrokes and the thing is so huge that
a I simply can't type on it without
accidentally mashing B every time I go
for the spacebar and be with autocorrect
autofill predictions the navigation bar
and some obnoxiously huge UI elements in
some places it's amazing how little of
the screen you actually get to you
sometimes
I guess it's got swipes tile typing now
but I don't care because I don't really
use that it needs other things to
improve first which leads to yet another
complaint who is this UI made for at
least TouchWiz knows it's for people
whose eyesight is starting to go and who
aren't that familiar with phones with
nice you know loud sound effects when
you mash on the gigantic buttons Windows
Phone on the other hand doesn't really
give you any indication whether a button
press worked other than you know after a
little bit doing the thing and on top of
that a single screen can have text as
wide as your
ace in headings and then like super tiny
micro tax that you have to squint out
unless you have perfect vision and on
top of that I just plain don't find it
very intuitive to use drag down to see
your notifications okay with you so far
click an email alright brings up an
email with you so far I'm looking at the
email okay now I'm done now what
maybe if I press back I'll land in the
Inbox no no that just takes me away okay
well is there maybe another button in
case I want to look at other emails when
I'm done with this one email that was in
my notifications or do I actually have
to go all the way back to the desktop
and open the email client from there wow
that's slow and lots of things are slow
like this how about a quick-draw speed
competition to dial someone's phone
number no t9 dialing is a big heaping
wheelbarrow full of suck on top of all
the other things that are slow above
this process some stuff is okay though
quick toggles are reconfigurable in the
main stuff including portable hotspot
sharing is here also I was corrected
when I said on our podcast that folder
support on the desktop is still missing
you can create folders of apps making
organization quite a bit easier now so
that's good
changing ringtones lets you change
without previewing at full volume which
is nice good for parents with newborns
and I love the control that you have
over snoozing and dismissing
notifications every oh s needs this let
me control how long its news is for and
there's more positive stuff to Cortana
is actually quick to use and seems to
learn a little bit after the first time
for a given task like call Yvonne it
doesn't force me to navigate
unnecessarily through menus to confirm
things so for things like basic voice
dialing and sending quick SMS messages
it's really fast but I also think it's
been oversold a little bit while actual
speech recognition from you was great
there's still no support for basic
system setting stuff like volume control
and screen brightness and I found it
very flow breaking to have to press the
voice button in between interactions you
know like show me where there's a sushi
restaurant okay here's something nearby
you can't just keep talking you have to
press the button again
it is very promising for the future
though and I'm excited to see where
Microsoft is taking this one because
it's pretty darn mature for a first
attempt okay so it's conclusion and more
thoughts time I think the bottom line
from you here is that while in my mind
HTC did a great job of delivering the
best enthusiasts grade Windows Phone 8.1
experience they could you know their
social media feed blinkfeed works as a
live tile the duo camera we're depth
feature and quick video and photo
highlight reel features are enabled
through apps as well and they did a
great job but even if their entire
company was staffed by like cowboy
astronaut millionaires there was nothing
they could do to make the Windows Phone
ecosystem suitable for enthusiasts
high-end use nothing basic functionality
call people take pictures and video chat
on skype all this stuff works so I guess
I could recommend it for my mom but go
any further than that and I don't
understand why anyone would want it for
intermediate users like my sister she's
going to be baffled by the need to use
third-party applications some of which
cost money for stuff like YouTube and
then as we get into the higher end
enthusiasts who are able to jump through
those technical hoops the ones that are
likely to be also jumping on the trends
of like wearables and connected devices
and stuff and we got another
deal-breaker
the lack of third-party developer
support becomes a complete no-go for
Windows and it happens over and over the
unofficial pebble app does some cool
stuff actually but doesn't notify of
calls and texts apparently due to
Microsoft policies deal-breaker the
unofficial drop can app supports new
images every two-and-a-half seconds with
no live video audio or historical video
scrubbing deal-breaker and it's just on
and on like that battery life was a very
positive point with the phone often
lasting me two full days or more but I
think a big part of this is how
inefficient to use it was and therefore
how little time I actually spent using
it even stupid stuff like trying to find
a draft email that I started creating on
the desktop in the stock email client
which is otherwise one of the better
the windows phone was just such a waste
of time that I would just walk to my
computer if it was nearby so all in all
this phone baffles me a little bit it's
a phone for no-one I understand that
some people have a thing for supporting
the market underdog and are willing to
work around numerous and communities to
do it or have specific complaints about
Google and Apple that would cause them
to want to avoid using the services of
both of those companies and for you
there's high end Windows phones like the
One m8 for Windows for everyone else
there's stuff out there that's just
plain more functional and easier to use
and in the case of the One m8 also
exactly the same price so the conclusion
pretty much writes itself here guys
thanks for watching like the video if
