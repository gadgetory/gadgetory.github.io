the winners of the 239 60x Extreme
Edition and gigabyte x79 ud3 motherboard
combos that we gave away through the
linus tech tips firm so guys if you
missed this one stay tuned you know make
more will do more giveaways in the
future but unfortunately this one's over
all you had to do to enter was create a
post under the likenesses videos news
and ramblings stickied thread intel core
i7 extreme edition gigabyte ex with me
on you d three give away our sponsors
were intel and gigabyte you had to share
some stuff on Twitter and share some
stuck somewhere else and here are
basically the contest rules and
regulations it was a worldwide contest
and we did in fact have someone win from
widely around the world and so yeah this
is exciting and I'm just kind of
stalling for time while I tell you guys
who won but yeah i can't i can't
remember slicks telling me anyway i'll
tell you guys how we selected them so
you could get one entry for posting and
then bonus entries for sharing so what
we had to do was we were not expecting
merely this many entries but we had to
painstakingly go through and find people
who earned bonus entries and made sure
that they were actually valid so that
was tough and then we had to also
validate that anyone who entered was not
a double entry so we have a way of doing
that but we can't really tell you the
details of it because unfortunately that
would make it easier to circumvent in
the future so the winners are okay why
don't you just say it because I forget
yeah Calvin 13 and la px Calvin 13 in la
px guys you are the big winners don't
worry if you don't see this video we're
going to contact you through the forum
