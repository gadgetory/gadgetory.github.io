this but you remember that scene for
Raiders of the Lost Ark that's the first
one right I think I've seen poor you
mean that's the first one why don't we
get on with this this is the Dukey I
think it's due gee I don't care
s90 the modular phone that claims to
actually matter will it let's see and
this video is brought to you by thermal
take the thermal take a 500 has a modern
minimalist design with brushed aluminum
panels and dual hinge swing tempered
glass doors check it out today at the
link in the video description
so somehow on a phone this size they
still didn't manage to include a
headphone jack how does that even happen
I actually think they get a pass really
yes because this is a rugged phone this
phone is ip68 rated it's also ip69k o
rated so that's the like high
temperature like I press ties although
what you're doing with your phone where
you need to put it under a high pressure
spray to clean it I mean foreign
directors Ebola crisis response team
okay who knows
and then drop-wise how are we doing on
this thing I don't think there's
actually any drop numbers per se but
they do advertise military-grade
durability with its ballistic proof and
salt corrosion spray proof and mold
proof so feature-wise
this thing actually has like kind of
pretty much everything it's got a five
thousand milliamp hour battery 5050
sorry excuse me
it's got a 16 megapixel rear camera
eight megapixel front camera it's got
microSD expansion it's got an eight core
Helio P 60 processor six gigs of RAM 128
gigs of storage dual SIM support it's
got whatever this is what this isn't oh
the sims in there that's a waterproof
thing it's the only thing that's missing
is the headphone jack really though the
thing that attracted us to it is this
accessory package so included with the
phone you've got what appears to be an
antenna you've got okay that's just a
regular type C cable this one's pretty
cool this is just a Type C 2 type 8 it
comes with that so you can plug in
pretty much any USB device you'd like
it's got this wall wart that we're gonna
have to use a different one because
that's incompatible
it's got whatever this is oh my god is
that what this is yes
is there a walkie-talkie it's a
walkie-talkie
that's pretty cool okay we're gonna have
to try that later gravy inter what is a
great inter that reads 86 and we're
definitely dude you're not even 90 I am
90 go I'm not moving at all go check
broken sound Peter
alright guys so welcome to Linus tech
tips I'm going to be checking out the
new ps90 it's reading annoying boss you
did that right in my ear put this back
on here yeah I think you can throw it I
think it's fine yeah that's the idea
right Oh
Oh
Doogie Oh Doogie
yeah so I think it's pretty fair to say
that in spite of our abuse this thing
doesn't even have a scratch on it well
we were lucky that we didn't throw with
any accessories on it because these
accessories are not rugged at all or
waterproof okay so they just clip on in
there and I mean it stayed on hey I
think it was trying to give us
instructions the accessories can cause
significant errors and compass
applications connecting OTG when back
clip powers connected neither will be
available oh so basically they have just
rerouted the USB type-c interface here
that's a sweet interface though boom
what the hell is water camera the
interface does not support touch
function press volume up and photo key
to capture well that makes sense when
you're underwater and you can't tap it
yeah so you use the buttons this is not
an amazing camera so this is the rear
camera the autofocus is abominable like
it keeps grabbing you and then just
completely losing you it's a Samsung
camera it's gonna have a really hard
time with that this thing it struggles
at the best of times okay give me your
best action hero pose yeah this is
really not a strong performance should
we see I think that walkie-talkie
working no I think we should move on
alright cuz no one's gonna buy that
people are gonna buy this the battery
wanted an extra five thousand milliamp
hours this doesn't feel like 5,000
milliamp hours I bet it does when it's
on there and you still can't use OTG
that's pretty annoying and you also lose
your fingerprint reader it's covered now
this thing is really unwieldly like
compared to the 13,000 milliamp hour
EULA phone that we checked out recently
this feels so much more ungainly like if
you're gonna have a big phone it is so
much more space and weight efficient to
just have a bigger battery in the phone
in the first place versus trying to clip
on an accessory this is why I think
three modular phone concept up until now
has failed
now one thing Doogie is doing a little
bit differently is they're trying to
build accessories that someone might
actually want and this night vision one
is really the most unique one you know
what I think people would think it just
looks like one of those pop-up things
what are those calls all those those pop
rings it looks like you got a camera
themed one you know like you can get
those coffee months that look like
lenses like I work in film so I got one
of these lens yeah
so it works in the day there's a lot of
noise a lot of green here hmm I don't
think this is night vision at all I
think this is just a big lens that
captures more light like yes in a very
dark situation I could hold this up in
front of me and like kind of be able to
see but with the same amount of
preparation I could grab a flashlight
you know I mean honestly the phone
itself I don't really have any
particular issue with if you want a
rugged phone there aren't a ton of
options out there there's those
underpowered ones from cat there's that
EULA phone that we checked out recently
but that is not waterproof even though
it's got like a really kind of beefy
rugged ish feeling build so I mean I pay
I'd say three hundred and fifty bucks
four hundred bucks is fair when the
Kickstarter ends it's gonna be three
hundred seven US dollars to house
wireless charging too doesn't it yes it
has Wireless char except that if you go
and put an accessory on it you lose it
correct so there's a couple things we
missed there's a game module that's like
a game controller or something like that
and then apparently the modules kind of
aren't that amazing right now but they
could make more in the future like the
5d one so this could extend the lifetime
of this device right well it's the same
issue we run into with every modular
phone where that assumes that they sell
enough of these things and the modules
to fund the development of future
modules which is something that to my
knowledge simply has not happened yet
those of you rocking the moto Z force
you know rock on baby power to you if it
makes you happy to have a rugged phone
at a decent price that's kind of
unwieldly in the hand you're trying to
stand it up at about 87 degrees that we
try to do there then go for it
otherwise get a pixel of night sight a
lot happens at your front door without
you ever realizing it and ring is on a
mission to reduce crime in communities
their video doorbell to can get that
done it features 1080p HD resolution
with a hundred and sixty degrees of
vision and night vision and its motion
sensing so it'll alert you if anything
is happening in the field of view of the
camera it's also adjustable by the way
if you live near busy street so it's not
just sending you a notification all the
time
it's got two-way audio so you can talk
to whoever set the front door and it's
Wi-Fi capable so you can check what's
going on wherever you are
it's powered by 8 to 24 volt AC doorbell
wiring and or the battery bank and it
connects via an app that works on your
smart phone whether it's iOS or Android
and even on your desktop with both Mac
and Windows 10 compatibility and today
