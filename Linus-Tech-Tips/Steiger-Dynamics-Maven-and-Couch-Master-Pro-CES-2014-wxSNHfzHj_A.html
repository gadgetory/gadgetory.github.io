brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital hey guys we're here in
the Venetian ballroom checking out
staggered dynamics I know you guys have
seen them before they've been in some of
our contest before I know a lot of you
are familiar with them but you're also
familiar with the crazy price point so
there's two really cool things that they
brought here to CES the first one is the
maven it's a cheaper version of the leap
that used to be around it's a little bit
costed down what it's also a little bit
featured down but I think a lot of you
will really appreciate that because you
can still get the build quality and
really really nice finish and quality
components that you couldn't elite but
it's just a little bit costed down so
it's a lot more affordable and easier
for people to get at it's it's still a
premium product and it still has a
premium price tag just not quite as
expensive it used to be so it's actually
quite interesting also they now have
other options for platforms so if you're
into AMD they have configurable options
for you to be able to get AMD platforms
in there and you can still change
everything else and that's really
interesting to see I know a lot of you
guys are really interested in steam
machine and really excited for steamos
to become fully released and not beta
anymore but this is something you can
look into we see a lot of stuff around
CES and before CES about different
companies releasing steam machines this
isn't necessarily a steam machine but if
you're into it I would look into this
because a lot of the other steam
machines you might as well just build
them yourselves with a Stiga dynamic
system you're getting that amazingly
beautifully finished case that you can't
really get anywhere else so I see more
value in this than another system that
I'd rather just build myself next at
steger dynamics we have the couch master
pro as for features and build and all
that kind of stuff there isn't a ton of
changes they've moved from a wooden top
to a plastic top which will reduce
weight for shipping costs and we'll just
reduce weight in general because that
wouldn't top did actually wait quite a
bit other than that there hasn't been a
ton of changes or some minor cable
routing stuff has changed and that's
about it but there's another really cool
announcement here is that stair dynamics
is distributing it so you can get it
from an american distributor now instead
of trying to get it shipped in from
Germany all the time which was really
expensive back in the day so it's a lot
easier for you to get it get it now
thanks for watching our video is tigger
dynamics and couch master if you want to
