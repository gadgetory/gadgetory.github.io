internal engineering samples going to
great lengths to ensure that if they
leave the lab it is in pieces so small
that they could never be reassembled
again so the first question we need to
answer is how did we get our hands on
this thing
eBay obviously what can't you buy on
eBay a sponsorship online is tech tips
for that you have to talk to Colton like
Corsair did of course there's dark core
SE RGB wireless mouse features one
millisecond 2.4 gigahertz and low
latency Bluetooth connectivity check it
out at the link below
so the seller turned out to have been a
contractor at Intel a few years ago who
in the middle of a sixth-floor
renovation went dumpster diving through
the boxes full of junk that was destined
for the e-waste pile apparently it was a
treasure trove of press samples laptops
and this GPU looking thing that was
noteworthy for being blue instead of
green or red you see by that point
project Larrabee this sort of had been
cancelled for years and how many years
depends on which cancellation you're
going by so talking to Tom Forsythe
who was one of the key team members he
figures they got cancelled anywhere from
four to five times and remembers getting
these weird memos yeah you guys are
gonna see some headlines it's just a
thing none of you were laid off just
keep on working
bt-dubs you've been rebranded xeon phi
thanks bye
so what is this thing that's actually a
somewhat complicated question but
because it's got a DVI port
not to mention DisplayPort and HDMI
soldered onto it it is technically an
engineering sample board for Intel's
first and to date only dedicated
graphics card now most people who follow
the mainstream tech press believe that
project Larrabee was an abject failure
but as is so often the case the truth is
actually stranger than fiction not only
was it a success but it powered th2
which was the world's most powerful
supercomputer for over two years and ten
years later you can actually still buy
its descendants either in socketed form
as we reviewed just last year or on
Amazon for a cool 1,500 greenbacks so as
it turns out
goal of the program never was actually
to create a gaming GPU that was just a
workload that was already fairly well
understood at the time because you got
to remember back in the mid 2000s the
idea of using a GPU as a general-purpose
computing unit was just emerging so this
this idea of using it for gaming was
actually just a small part of a business
case to build a processor that had many
highly efficient x86 course that could
be easily just like slotted into these
powerful supercomputers but that doesn't
mean that it couldn't have been used for
gaming in fact by the time they wound
down the units that were working on
graphics they had about 300 of the top
selling games on Steam running on the
thing with a card just like this one as
the only GPU in the system and the way
this whole thing worked is incredible
now a normal graphics card or GPU rather
uses a lot of fixed function hardware so
if you told it okay look I don't need
shaders just draw a ton of tiny lines
with really nice anti-aliasing so it's
pretty much CAD you know nutshell it
would use only a fraction of its
hardware but with Laribee everything is
software so the whole chip is lit up
doing that so that actually helped to
offset the x86 overhead a fair bit this
was the fastest CAD card at the time and
it had other benefits with regular GPUs
you might run into a situation where
enabling a particular feature in a game
might hit the AMD users a lot harder
than the Nvidia users or vice versa
so during development ambien Nvidia they
both have to actually guess as best they
can what the next couple of years of
games will demand and then try to look
into there
steel ball and build their hardware
around that Larrabee no such limitation
this thing is a full-blown computer with
up to 61 quad threaded course running a
normal operating system like FreeBSD
like you could actually telnet into the
thing and run a top command and see a
list of all the processes that were
running on it and if you were running a
game you'd see I don't know 128 or or
200 processes called DirectX graphics
and you could do that while the thing
was working so if you wanted you could
cordon off some of the cores and use
them for something else or you could
just yolo it and throw another workload
into the mix and then just let the
processor manage itself the only non
programmable Hardware on this puppy is
the texture unit which takes very simple
commands I mean wrap your brain around
this the thing that I'm looking at right
here is Intel's first ever DirectX 11
GPU even though it was built before
DirectX 11 so this was possible because
all of those graphics card features that
are normally running in hardware are
just running in software so you could
actually update it to DirectX 11 or
DirectX 12 with a driver update now
there are some caveats here I mean
there's a reason that the thing never
made it into a computer near you it
wasn't as efficient as a dedicated
graphics card for a lot of things so it
only got about a quarter of the
performance in games as a comparably
power consuming card from AMD or Nvidia
at the time but it was really good at
certain graphics workloads for a number
of
and I mean if you think about it and you
look at how far off they were
considering that they were effectively
emulating dedicated hardware it's damn
impressive so what happened well
management happened Intel at its core ha
ha is a hardware company so they wanted
all the features completed so they could
either ship this thing or cannon because
in the hardware world making up a four
times difference in performance is
impossible and you might as well just
pull the plug but the team wanted to
work on performance optimization instead
because in the software world it's not
unheard of to go from like two pixels
showing up on a screen and dog slow to a
hundred times faster in a week if you
have a breakthrough and it got to the
point where they had to have separate
teams for performance and for features
to get management off their backs so the
performance team actually got quake
running like really fast but then they
found out that quake was this weird edge
case and the architecture would have to
be completely redone I mean to give you
that some idea of the dysfunction at one
point there were three to four software
teams with different ideas and working
on different rendering architectures but
depending who you ask the continued
development would have been worth it I
mean imagine this instead of turning
anti-aliasing on for an entire scene
imagine if a game developer could say
well you know what this sky is not
important to be anti-aliased
why don't we just focus all of our AAA
on you know these characters here or
this foliage there or how about this
like oh crap that texture wasn't loaded
you know what let's just procedurally
generate a placeholder boom arguably the
stupidest decision that was made was to
make the Larrabee graphics team
and the gen graphix team which is what
Intel calls its integrated graphics
internally compete together for the same
budget and then like make internal
presentations arguing about why their
approach was good in the future and the
other groups was bad and not the future
because they were both perfectly
suitable for what they were doing
Larrabee was never going to be a 5 watt
part that you could fake right into a
CPU and a 200 watt PCI Express part was
nowhere on the roadmap for Jen so what
I've got here is not Knights ferry that
was the first Larrabee revision that had
some deal breaking bugs
apparently the saying in the hardware
industry is always plan to make a
prototype since you'll end up making one
anyway so this is Knights corner and
probably has anywhere from 6 to 16 gigs
of RAM and up to 62 cores
depending on how many of them had some
manufacturing flaws should we fire it up
I mean come on I wasn't not gonna do
that at this point I spent like $400 on
this thing off of ebay
I've got no drivers for it so it's
actually this is the first time I've
turned it on so it is very possible that
it won't manage to display anything even
in 2d but I definitely have to try by
the way if anyone out there has the
secret sauce drivers or has access to
the secret sauce drivers that would make
this run games please hit me up I mean
assuming that it even works which we
don't know yet I actually haven't tried
this I wanted to save the suspense for
the video this is like far more
postcodes than I'm accustomed to seeing
but it hasn't stopped and it hasn't like
rebooted we've got some kind of we've
got some kind of LED
here it looks like it stalled on d6 but
I don't know what that is now when I
talked to Tom he did specifically
mention it's got DVI soldered to it now
I don't know if that's because DVI was
the most relevant output at the time so
that's like what they used internally or
if the display port an HDMI were just
dummies and DVI was the only thing that
actually worked so cake - I'm gonna run
and grab a DVI monitor and gonna try
this again like I kind of wonder about
you know what it's PCIe I mean would
that be even Gentoo at that point like
2000 2007 2009
I wonder about compatibility with a new
board and stuff like that you know what
I don't think it's gonna boot well
that's pretty disappointing I thought I
might be onto something with the whole
DVI thing I'm just gonna try I'm gonna
try one other slot just - I think
there's only one other one out in the
wild and some like Russian collector of
like weird hardware has it yep not you a
different one okay sometimes this hangs
on 79 for a bit and then this thing
boots so that might have been a good
sign no that's d6 again I think it's not
going anywhere
well that was disappointing but I'm
gonna let it keep trying while I tell
you guys about mass drop ah like sad
it's like hard to have any energy okay
you try that again master off mass drop
is featuring the Sennheiser PC 37 X
gaming headset they've got angled
drivers and an open back design and the
drivers actually come from the same
family as the HD 598 and HD 600
headphones they offer superior stereo
imaging and locational accuracy and come
with a noise cancelling microphone
they're available on mass drop at the
link below for a limited time for just a
hundred and twenty US dollars so go
check them out
thanks for watching guys if this video
sucked you know what to do but if it was
awesome
get subscribed hit that like button you
can especially hit that like button if
you want to make me feel better about
how disappointed I feel right now or you
can check out the link to where to buy
the stuff we featured in the video
description also linked in the
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join oh I really I was really hoping I
was just gonna get the screen to light
up that was all I was really I was all I
really wanted
good night sweet prince you were too
good for this world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
