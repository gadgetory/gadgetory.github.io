look at another fractal designs product
this is the Tesla 650 watt power supply
are you going to be able to read this
from here the camera man standing really
far away from me due to the lighting
situation in this room so sorry about
that it's a high-efficiency 80-plus
certified silent which means virtually
inaudible 120-millimeter fan okay so why
don't we go around to the side it comes
with a five-year warranty it has 4 12
volt rails each up to 20 amps of power
active power factor correction it has
over current and over voltage and over
power protection supports 80 x 1080 x 12
volt be 2.2 okay as well as the older
standards full range universal inputs
okay extra long cables to support full
tower cases that makes sense because
their case uses a bottom mounted power
supply design so if they built a power
supply that doesn't work very well in
their case that would be stupid extra
long cables yeah okay ultra quiet
120-millimeter fan multi-language manual
five year warranty okay so why don't we
go ahead and get this open the Tesla
series is based on the award-winning
Newton r2 power supply but with fixed
cables instead of modular so the Tesla
combines a higher power output with low
noise level by using premium quality
power supply components can provide a
user with powerful outputs while the
phone is still running at low speeds
okay so fretful designs is based out of
Sweden I believe there's mention of that
somewhere here alright so why don't we
get this box open comes in a matte black
box and it feels kind of panic Lindsay
but I guess it's not really going to
matter because most of the time the box
is not going to be subject to too much
stress for a power supply alright so the
first thing we find inside is the user's
manual which as they mentioned comes in
a bunch of different languages including
English French I can't remember if that
means Dutch or German I think it means
German actually cameraman
wrong but Italian Spanish and Swedish
all right thank you for buying list some
basic specs okay that's nice oh I always
like to see these little nice touches
included so it has some little velcro
cable management ties very nice four
screws for mounting the power supply
then you've got a wow that's interesting
so i'm guessing the north american
version of this this is a sample will
have a north american plug okay but
you'll have to find your own power
connector for now piece of foam some
silica gel don't eat that it's bad for
you says right on it throw away do not
eat I love that that warning never gets
old it's like everything inedible with
every product should come with a warning
do not eat like if you buy your car your
car manual should come with like you
know I g'morning it's like because
there's a big risk that people will eat
anything um okay so let's have a look at
the unit itself basic specs are here so
you've got up to 600 watts of the 650
total watts for this power supply are
available on the 12 volt rail now it
looks like they've over spected a little
bit because oh no no okay so that's all
over here so it's 650 watts total but
they're cheating a little bit there
including the minus 12 volt rail and the
plus 5 volt rail as well those are not
really very relevant these days many
high high quality power supplies can
provide their total maximum output on
the 12 volt rails okay so there you've
had enough time to look at that the
warranty void if seal label is broken is
present on here it's got a matte black
finish okay so it sounds reasonably
fingerprint resistant that's always nice
to see because you are gonna have to
touch it to install it in your case
alright well at the back you've got your
standard kind of honeycomb air
ventilation holes then you've got a
power switch power in and then here we
find a 120-millimeter fan this fits in
with their usual color scheme which is
black and white looks very very sharp
oh that's weird they've got little plugs
on the fan to make it so you can't
remove it interesting okay so in terms
of connectors let's have a look at what
we got first things first we've got a 20
plus 4 pin power connector that uses a
breakaway style cable very nice it's
white it's nice to see somebody shaking
this up everybody uses black why doesn't
someone use white you might ask well now
they do okay then we've got in 8 pin
power connector and as they mentioned
this is an adequate length to install in
a full tower chassis even with a bottom
mounted power supply that's really nice
to see okay then we've got two PCI
Express 6 plus 2 connectors ok just like
that these use a breakaway style and
they're very clearly labeled I like the
labels on their connectors actually
that's very nice ok and then delving
further into the recesses of this power
supply so to speak we have two molex
cables one of which features 2 molex and
one floppy and one of which features 3
molex connectors all right since molex
is becoming so much less relevant these
days I don't mind seeing them cut down a
little bit on that and then for say that
we have two cables each featuring three
SATA connectors oh and this is
interesting I have never seen this
before the to say the cables aren't
actually completely different lengths
look at that so they've accounted for
the fact that one of them is going to
have to go further than the other
because whether you're using a bottom
out what are you doing whether you're
using a bottom mounted power supply or a
top-mounted power supply you're either
going to need one to go further up to
the optical drives or a further down to
the hard drives and they've they've
accounted for that look at that ok well
thank you for checking out my unboxing
at the Tesla 650 watt power supply from
a fractal
