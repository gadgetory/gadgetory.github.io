we're live welcome to the Linus tech
tips livestream featuring the one and
only slick PC in spite of that one guy
who keeps asking me to fire him I
haven't done it yet today today we both
have the same earbuds which causes no
small amount of confusion or would cause
no small amount of confusion if we ever
put them in a pile next to each other
which would be a bit of a problem so
we're both using flux in your pros what
do you think I like them
did you ever try the non pros yeah I
didn't mind those they were good but I
liked how well these will hook around
your ear right and how well they sit in
your ear the only complaint I have about
the non proces like these ones they
talked about when we're in their suite
that they're designed after hearing aids
right yeah so they fit in your ear
really well and they don't really come
out of your ear that much right and then
the cable can go right up and around
your ear so there's not a lot of tension
with the non pros they're designed to
kind of stick out of your ear and then
go down a stick and then go straight
down you know what I discovered though
is that with the non pros if you're
really jamming in there yeah I will hold
on no no really though that's that's why
they're so long you're supposed to I
found if I put a size smaller ear tip on
it and then I put them right in not only
did they sound great
the noise isolation was outstanding and
they didn't stick out really far anymore
I'm even able to lie down on them
without them being uncomfortable so
they're there so that's pretty cool I
didn't go that far with it I don't like
right right yeah fair enough cuz they're
more like in ear canal almost yeah which
is kind of weird well it's not for
everyone that's for sure and wouldn't
that be worse - for your ears I mean if
you cranked it maybe sure you know I
would think so yeah all right so what's
our first topic for the week sorry if my
voice sucks guys I'm kind of sick yeah I
know it's a common topic yeah we sort of
talked about that a lot but yeah let's
move on to a new topic
so our first topic of the week is tomb
raider 2013 edition
already 50% off on Steam it's not even
the summer sale yet like I kind of
expected stuff like this in the summer
sale because the summer steam summer
sale always like just the most
ridiculous thing it's like please stay
inside and play video games I don't even
for a few months I've already I've
started doing this like a few months
back and for until the summer sale comes
around what I do is I'll actually for
any games that I hear up that I want and
any games that go are on sale that I'm
like oh that looks interesting I put it
in a list in a notepad on my computer
and I just wait even if it goes on like
a crazy weekend only say oh I'm like oh
just put that in the list wait for the
summer sale because it's so cheap it's
basically like like boxing boxing week
or I guess for the American viewers kind
of like like a Black Friday type thing
it's kind of its kind of Awesome it's
just not worth while to buy anything any
other time yeah but I mean this comes
back to our discussion about Crysis 3 so
that came out and then it was discounted
within a couple weeks in spite of being
evidently a hot selling title should you
preorder anything ever see like at this
point the main reason why I would ever
see to preorder anything is if you can
find a place where you're gonna get some
amount of benefit from it because like
sometimes steam will do that oh if
enough people pre-order and you always
hit the third tier and there's three
tiers of pre-order benefits and
sometimes like it comes with other games
right and it'll come with like other
games DLC like all the stuff so
sometimes the pre-order benefits are
really big and exclusive so sometimes
it's worth it I have bills hat in left
in Team Fortress 2 so you like see stuff
like that
but that's I think where the benefit of
bar girly is gonna be now because it's
not price it's not price anymore yeah
it's like two three weeks four weeks
after the after it actually comes out
it's already like yeah so someone says
yeah people are still complaining about
the audio levels I actually don't
understand okay here we can try moving
it a little closer
the mic yeah we'll try Whaley just said
audios great okay it's easier to turn
down than it is for people who are maxed
out to turn it up so I understand yeah I
understand why that's the problem why
don't we turn to a little bit of Twitter
Q&amp;amp;A so let's go ahead and do this
Oh oh yeah another topic actually before
we before we go any further is our after
party this week assuming slick and I can
get it working we'll probably get it
working right I think so
is gonna be our super mario world
livestream at least like at least the
started they probably have to do more
than one segment yeah it's not gonna be
in one sitting I mean the reality of it
is I told my wife about the concept of
the Super Mario World livestream and she
was kind of like I mean you can't expect
wives to necessarily always get the
whole like game stream quite frankly I
don't really get the whole game
streaming thing but I mean it's more for
us we're not doing like a let's play
this is more of just we're doing it
normal we're probably gonna be talking
about random stuff just like we do in
the after party yeah but just instead of
the whole screen being us it'll probably
be a small webcam view and then super
viral and like who doesn't like super
well can I have a webcam be of you what
are you wearing what that's true I can't
see what you're wearing
you're exposed knees are very sensual
haha
exposed well slick wears shorts to work
which I mean I'm not the best dressed
gentleman wears sandals
that's true but sandals are very
practically wear nice shirts when you
need to yes that is true if you're not
gonna be in front of camera you were
like badminton shirts and stuff
yes that's true you probably just don't
like how many shorts do you own ah a
couple
they're all the same and I have no like
them I have three pairs of jean shorts
that I actually don't like cuz it makes
my butt look big there so that's why you
don't wear shorts
I love shorts shorts are amazing
that actually could be part of the
reason all right so moving along to
Twitter Q&amp;amp;A ah watching from Norway but
not at a LAN party second time tuning in
from Austria I think this new timeslot
really does work well for a lot of a lot
of people really really well George says
apparently there's a giveaway of
leftover steam codes on the forum cool
that actually happens like a lot yeah
that's neat if you're if you don't have
many steam games like honestly hang
around the forum there's there's one guy
that does steam giveaways all the time
for just drawing him random things
that's kind of cool and he'll pick like
not the best drawing at all he'll pick
like the thing that he just kind of
likes the most and usually it has
nothing to do with the best drawing at
all it's just what makes him laugh so
that's pretty cool I know one of our
mods has done a giveaway I know like
there's a lot of giveaways eventually uh
speaking of giveaways on the forum the
user dragon tale submitted a Mass Effect
2 steam car I think oh crap I think it's
an Origin code yeah I think it's an
Origin code but one way or another it's
a free copy of Mass Effect 2 that he
sort of told me I could give away on the
livestream so instead I opted to give it
away on the forum in the doctor that
that done I'm gonna see if I can
remember what my hotkey is for this one
this whoops whoops whoops whoops whoops
whoops whoops Oh we'll be back in a
moment
what's going on there we go alright so
in this thread here called the post
Linus memes here thread which actually
has some pretty funny stuff okay this
one's not that great but basically the
winner selected by me and slick is gonna
win a copy of Mass Effect 2 I think it's
just sort of for fun put yours up and
running and it's gone love it I have to
keep going until I find my favorite one
I don't actually burst out laughing at
not much stuff I see on the internet but
this thread has got me going a couple
times yeah this threads actually just
kind of awesome but where is it
here we go here we go oh no oh yeah that
one's not bad that one's not bad but
there's another slick one that I think
is my personal favorite so far however
it is - I think it's pretty early on I
like this have you seen oh yeah yeah I
saw this one oh my goodness oh okay you
know what hold on we're gonna cut back
to back to us for a second vbulletin has
taken care of us at this point they've
issued a full refund so we are now
square with them it's all good yeah
still funny though this one's just
terrifying weird
I mean there's like a black Linus I've
never seen that before
okay I think it's got to be page three
because it was pretty early on closed
cell foam hold on hold on hold on trust
me trust me it's worth it oh I thought I
was okay closed cell phone yeah yeah
yeah yeah final assembly okay okay yeah
no no did someone get rid of it maybe
that's bizarre okay well there's a slick
one that we both saw that we both really
liked that I thought was quoted in here
a few times a lot of people talked about
it but it was basically slick giving a
big thumbs up with the caption ei at the
bottom and I have no idea what happened
here
see some of these so so anyway guys feel
free to post on the thread you can win a
free copy of Mass Effect 2 courtesy of
dragon tail one of the members of our
forum alright so back to Twitter right
that's where we left off closing soon
are you ready for has well we have
Haswell chips we have has well boards
coming soon we had a conversation with a
soos that involves a lot of a lot of
really cool stuff heading our way so
we're gonna be hopefully doing like some
build guides and some benchmarks and
talking about has well a whole a whole
heck of a lot Andy wants to know when
we're expecting the Nvidia 700 series we
have no idea and if we did we wouldn't
be able to tell you so if we did I would
tell you we have no idea so there you go
that should tell you all you need to
know slick have you tried Far Cry 3
Blood Dragon yet no why not so well I
don't have a code yet oh well you
haven't never settled yeah
but they haven't sent it I don't think
never settle the center with their codes
yet so I'm waiting for never settle to
send out their codes and then I will
play the crap out of blood dragon I'm so
excited you saw like if I showed you
right yes it is a gift for two guys are
fighting on the road and then sub jag
antic techno lizard just dives by and
takes a guy out I'm so excited this game
it's so 80s
oh my goodness so excited ahh so what's
up with has well what would you expect
from online gaming platforms in the
future we've talked about that a fair
bit I think already on previous live
streams 15 top poster on the forums
today is the apparently Dillon grant
nice awesome yes super mario of finally
is coming here doing him scooch forward
a little bit apparently you're a little
out of focus tuning in from sweden at 1
a.m. love it guys thank you for tuning
in and apparently lots of new
interactions oh this is interesting so
we got our hands on a 79 90
today but the only hands-on time we had
with it was to basically just like video
the card itself we didn't actually get a
chance to benchmark it at all which was
sort of disappointing so that made me
that made me sad but hopefully we'll get
a chance to really benchmark it but the
problem with benchmarking the 7990 is
that due to the fact that it's running
crossfire and AMD's drivers aren't
really optimized for the best frame
times the frame rates might be really
high but the actual perceived
performance is not necessarily that high
on a crossfire solution right now and
unless you have a really high-end
capture PC with some special software
and a lot of time to sit down and and
really go through frame by frame what
was actually being displayed it's really
hard to get performance numbers for
crossfire these days until AMD fixes the
issue they have a prototype driver that
looks a lot better but it's nowhere near
available to the public yet so it's
supposed to be like twenty percent
increase rate um a way better way better
not like in terms of the perceived
performance and the perceived stuttering
miss of it it's supposed to be
absolutely made better can you email
that to me so that I can open it up over
there yeah all right so we found I'm
trying to get the user's name we found
the meme that was sort of mine and mine
and slicks favorite so far that we done
through a thread only to find out it
like isn't there anymore for some reason
I had no idea why so we're gonna bring
that up soon oh we're gonna have a guest
next week I don't know if I told you
this yet vaguely mentioned something but
I don't actually know what's going on
okay so our guest here I'm just gonna
open up our livestream agenda here and
I'll take you to his website so he's a
bit of a local technology media
personality goes by the name of Steve
dotto so there you go he's got a website
he does more radio stuff he's he's a
little bit more focused on the business
side of the technology and how to how to
enable yourself to sort of save time and
make your life a little bit better with
it he doesn't focus on graphics cards or
stuff like that so I asked him to come
do a 20
at segments or so he does a lot of
speaking engagements locally so so yeah
I had I had a meeting with him and he
was he was interested in coming in and
joining us so I think it'll be
interesting to just kind of do the whole
guest thing again see how it goes
very knowledgeable he's been doing yeah
I mean he's run TV broadcast tech shows
in the past he's done online tech shows
like I said he does radio now extremely
experienced he's been doing Tech Talks
since I mean I basically knew where to
find the turbo button on a 386 or 486 or
whichever one was the one that came with
a turbo button or anyone remember
anymore so so yeah that should be kind
of fun um I don't know how carefully
you've gone through some of the topics
that I submitted for the live stream but
have you seen this yet yeah crazy so
guys it's really nice check this out I
don't know what ad that is by the time
this is from this is from no film school
com Netflix streaming loses 2000 titles
as Universal and MGM licenses expire so
there's a lot of talk right now about
what the heck does this actually mean
and I'm gonna I'm gonna throw this at
slick and so what's your take on this I
kind of read for Netflix and it's
actually pretty brutal that's so many
times haven't 1794 1794 titles and I
guess the thing that sort of got a lot
of people scratching their heads right
now is that at the same time Warner
Brothers is launching their archival
video service which is more focused on
older and obscure titles but there's
some overlap with the stuff that they
license just expired from Netflix for
and it's like okay so you got your own
service now Netflix is branching out
into content creation now like crazy
like crazy they're investing apparently
really liking it too so I mean at some
point in the future is is net does
Netflix become pretty much the same as
any other content delay
company excepted they were the kick in
the pants that forces the other guys to
figure out this whole digital content
distribution thing right the reason why
everyone pirates everything so maybe at
some point I mean what I what I've loved
about Netflix I have only used Netflix
for I had it for a few weeks because I'm
a cheapskate and I don't really watch
movies okay I just actually don't watch
movies I've watched one movie since my
son was born and that was over a year
ago I went to see The Hobbit
how was it right okay um so I don't
really watch movies so I didn't have it
for long but what I liked about it is
that you weren't locked into this
service or that service or that service
to the point where all of a sudden if
you're paying $7 a month for 10
different services it costs just as much
as a cable subscription which is what
I'm trying to get rid of yeah at that
point so are we moving towards more
fragmentation where each of the studios
maintains their own content library if
someone like YouTube's gonna win to a
code where they get all the original
programming well it could explode and
then come back in because they're doing
the subscriber thing I need to be like
everyone is trying to you know how
YouTube rolled out they're like you can
set up your channel subscription base
yes
everyone is kind of rolling out their
own big content subscription set up and
I'm wondering if everyone all the users
are gonna go this is too much crap and
like they're gonna want to go back to
just one group of maybe charters more so
maybe it's gonna get out of Netflix's
hands for a while and then someone
whether it's Netflix or maybe someone
else might be able to pull it all back
together because it's gonna be
frustrating managing like 10 different
subscriptions for all your stuff oh yeah
it's just ridiculous it's annoying that
was nice boosting like United
states-based Netflix Canadian Netflix
was never really that strong but United
States based Netflix where you just kind
of had everything yeah almost all the
movies you could think of tons of
documentaries all the shows almost and
quite frankly that's the kind of thing I
could see myself so sorry - whereas
Canadian Netflix
that flex really wasn't that special
yeah yeah BPM true enough but yeah so
there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff
being pulled off so things like so hold
on hold on here we go so self-park is is
off but it's not that big of a deal
because you can watch South Park online
legally anyway
Audrey rose James Bond classics like dr.
fingers those are still pretty good to
watch
so Netflix has taped on this is you know
what our library has always been in flux
we're also adding I think they said they
were adding several yeah 500 titles are
being added May first so that was two
days ago
so they're losing almost 1800 but a lot
of them are very possibly super old that
people possibly aren't watching how much
so they're adding Bachelorette adding
Hunger Games adding Mission Impossible
to I mean it's one of those things where
if you're subscribing to Netflix as a
service that's kind of like if I turn it
on there will be something to watch
mission probably accomplished as long as
they can maintain well especially the
states one yeah where I think this is
going on yeah because they have so much
stuff which actually reminds me there
was huge news the other day that I
actually didn't have in our live stream
in our lives between document but I'm
gonna open this up I just moved it over
there now so the first major youtube
channel acquisition just went down so
dreamworks announced the acquisition of
awesomeness TV 433 million which is
absolutely incredible so awesomeness TV
was him okay marked her peak and hold on
yeah so he's basically been involved in
some other so okay yeah here we go the
key to this success according to Der
Beek was Robin's experience creating
traditional television content aimed at
young viewers such as Smallville and One
Tree Hill so they basically took this
channel they got one of YouTube's grants
I think they got three and a half yeah
three and a half million from the series
a round last summer which added to a
five million original
from YouTube so they got a bunch of
money to build this channel they built
it up to 500,000 subscribers and around
80 million monthly views so this was on
Pando dailies just so that we're citing
our source here they got it up to the
VAT level and all of a sudden it's worth
33 million which is incredible because
this could be the beginning of you know
guys like I mean YouTube hasn't really
said okay yeah we're going to develop
content we're gonna hire all the people
and do it I don't think they're
interested in that they want to be a
platform but they've started investing
in content creators
whether it's Freddie Wong or whether
it's awesomeness TV or whoever else to
turn their platform into something that
major studios like DreamWorks are gonna
walk in and buy and start being content
producers on youtubes platform which
makes room for premium channels that
people will actually legitimately I
think pay for interesting one thing like
Freddie Wong and stuff it almost sucks
that it's named exactly after him cuz
for him he probably can't sell it or if
he did so I'd he'd have to stay a part
of it
but that's what's going on here as well
oh he's doing a part of it he's staying
onboard so him hold on let me just let
me just browse down I I read this sort
of in with great interest last last
night which was yeah it just it kind of
blew my mind so he's gonna stay on for I
think it was I can't see how long but
yeah so so Robbins is staying on and
he's going to be continuing to to
develop it under DreamWorks of course if
they're acquiring it for 33 million they
probably have some more money earmarked
to continue to invest in it and make it
more awesome but what I figure based on
this is that I must be a millionaire I'm
worth about four million views a month
on Linus tech tips so I figure it works
out perfectly such that you can just
extrapolate and so no yeah okay I guess
our production values aren't really
there that's never really been our
strength has it no
no no I guess I'm like the sale of a
tech channel on YouTube I don't think is
quite as much as like an original
content creator we create original
content yeah fair enough but not exactly
the same project
either way the you know between looking
at sort of Netflix's constant ebb and
flow of their content as well as I mean
this whole thing where YouTube channels
might turn into TV channels yeah I hope
that happens as soon as possible which
is just crazy yeah which is just
absolutely crazy I mean YouTube's been
they've been doing all this stuff I mean
they've been they've been one step ahead
yeah we need to support live we need to
support this we need to support that we
need to incentivize the content creators
to stay on this platform it's like they
support things I'm like EA Wow okay yeah
I guess we're we're half an hour in I
guess I had the throat it wasn't that it
wasn't that early for a shot at EA
speaking of speaking of EA did you did
you put that name in here no I can't
edit the dog did you email it to me I
think so at some point yeah there it is
okay so here we go guys so this was this
was the mean that's lik and I were
looking for before so it's basically
just that's the entire punchline that's
all the punchline we need how every joke
on their live stream ended yeah and they
never sponsored Linus tech tips ever
speaking of which yeah if you'd like to
sponsorship if you would like to sponsor
us just go for it okay in Germany
apparently YouTube created some original
channels that are paid by YouTube to
create high quality content well I mean
okay they had by YouTube yeah if they're
paid by YouTube and they actually hire
people who actually get a paycheck then
that's a little bit different from what
we've seen over here so there you go
seems I can't watch because my sister
took the tablet it's okay the archive
will go up right away this week we'll be
back to the usual way
doing it the problem was that we had to
wait for Twitch's archive which we could
then download and chop together in
Windows Live Movie Maker and then we had
to wait for it to upload and then we had
to wait to put in all the timestamps it
was just a really really glad you made
it before
hopefully it'll actually stay as one
this time hi Andrew welcome to watching
the live stream well live what's your
opinion on the Nexus 4 I don't know I
haven't heard much about it it just
seems like it kind of was there and
people were really excited about it I've
heard sales are really good but like
it's not a huge talking point I mean
it's an Android stock Android device but
honestly Nexus S also wasn't a huge
talking point people had them yeah but
it wasn't a huge talking point I think
what a few people have Nexus 4 is as
well well by comparison you look at how
much someone like a Samsung is spending
less time advertising yeah so because
Samsung is pushing all their phones
Google doesn't really do a little bit
well I think the login page for Gmail
now has something about I didn't even
look at it but I saw a phone so maybe
they're doing something but like the
advertising push behind Samsung is so
much bigger making it a talking point
right now I mean you have to look at it
from Google's perspective it's why are
you gonna push their hard work hard
we're platform so hard when ultimately
it was partners like Samsung that made
Android a success that were willing to
build the hardware before Google got
around to it yeah so yeah I mean and the
other thing to those with faster more
modern devices like the HTC One and the
Samsung Galaxy s4 hitting the market
being available now there is a unique
experience with Nexus devices though
okay I brought this up with my Nexus S I
went through three major platform
changes with that phone like that was
crazy and like right when it's announced
this released it's all my phone right
I've gots one thing with the Nexus
phones you always get the updates cuz
you're getting pushed from Google which
is kind of fantastic just that like
awesome support that you expect from
being attached to Google right let's
talk about this so a razor has launched
their comm software it's in beta right
now
I tried to install it and it basically
just kind of closed so I gave up because
I was going to test it with slick but
what I discovered is that when I
reinstall it might have been a problem
actually with my audio drivers I updated
the firmware on my f1 and the drivers
and everything's working a hundred
percent now so it might not have been
comms problem but I haven't tried it yet
personally but I sent this little link
over to slick so what are they trying to
do here exactly um I think they're
trying to play Skype because the
interface style like you know there's
the like Ventrilo teamspeak kind of
style where there's a server and you
join and disconnect from the server and
there's chat rooms and all that kind of
stuff yeah it's not set up like that
right which is why a lot of gamers have
started using Skype instead of yeah the
complicated setup that goes into back I
still kind of like I like I like mumble
I love mumble yeah same kind of thing oh
right we have something else to talk
about but I will continue this topic
until we're done sorry I just mod chat
reminded me about a serious serious
thing going on sorry for that segue I'll
come back so it has the social pain just
like Skype Desura shows everyone on your
friends list so on the left side on his
everyone on your friends list on the
left side and then you can open up chat
groups super super easily and you can
save those chat groups so you can kind
of make channels kind of behind save
chat groups okay so they have like your
team for whatever game you can save them
all as a chat group are we streaming
this page okay so let's see team Diablo
yeah so he's got a chat group gone
apparently there's a channel within
there I haven't used it enough I'm sorry
guys I guess you can maybe within
individual chat groups make channels
it's kind of interesting so that's cool
option to do there for like general
feedback on its performance its
auto-detected settings I'm finding are
not quite as good as Skype with Skype as
far as I can tell anyone just clicks
call and it works right like as long as
you have the right device pointing out
and stuff it just works with
was it comms yeah you used it for a
while I think we had up to six people on
it and all we noticed that is that maybe
you had to turn one dude up maybe you
had to slightly turn your own mic down
or up but it wasn't like it wasn't crazy
hardcore settings it was up one slider
okay not a big deal
anyone can do this setup fairly easy
level settings like I had a fan in my
room pointed directly at a desktop mic
so you would expect it to pick it up and
it was a little bit but it doesn't in
Skype but then I just turned to the
slider down a little bit and it was
totally fine I see so the auto detect
isn't quite as awesome escape but it's
super super easy to tune in so that's
awesome
one big problem that a lot of Skype
users especially myself hate is that if
we're in a game someone calls you like
the crazy annoying guy it's so loud it's
insanely loud and it will probably put
an overlay on your screen or it'll tab
you go to your game like if someone
hangs up the call you might get tabbed
out of your game and your whole call
ends if it's the person who started the
call and like there's all these kind of
major problems this one it will now
transfer the host cool we think we tried
it and then a really really loud
high-pitched noise came in and then
everyone could hear each other but it
was kind of crackly okay it is in beta
that's one big takeaway people need to
understand it is in beta beta and that's
not like the audio codec or anything so
right okay might just deal with that for
now it'll hopefully be fixed so I think
it's supposed to transfer the host in
the caller if you get a call you don't
really get a call and again if you get a
call in a game it'll come up in the
bottom right hand corner it will not tab
you out it'll pop up like a steamer
Xfire overlay okay if anyone knows about
that it has a key command just like
steamer Xfire so you can bind it to I
think whatever you want but it's a
control tab okay sure
it still kind of sucks cos crouching and
then check your score right but you
could change it too but I think 99% sure
you can change it I don't know why you
wouldn't be able to I haven't changed it
yet but I will
so that's kind of nice very
unobtrusive while you're in games which
escapes problem right and then the audio
is not quite as good but after a few
seconds you can get there so okay so
what I actually like it a lot so far I
think I'm gonna kind of make the jump
really I've been using skype favor I'm
still gonna use Skype for text chat for
a lot of people just because I have more
people in scape right but yeah for comms
in games
I hate Skype it pisses me off because it
constantly Tad's me out and just is a
massive annoyance
so that's the impression you said you
had six people everyone's kind of down
with it we've tried a lot of different
voice chats most of the guys most the
guys that haven't been gaming as long as
say like my brother and I like the Skype
style where it's a friends list yeah
more than the old channel based vent
kara style right so we've been using
Skype for a while but none of us have
been totally satisfied because of it
topping it out of games and stuff we've
been looking for a different solution
but there hasn't really been one quite
as good so usually we'll all download
the new thing that comes out try it for
a little bit and everyone bails and goes
back to Skype everyone's actually been
consistently using comms since we
downloaded it so I wonder what's the
benefit to razor to create this branding
I guess I think they're doing ads on it
okay so there's that price sorry
apparently they're their intention I
mean you know it's so low but their
branding is all over it so if you're
using coms for all your games and you go
to a store and you're you're if you're
just getting into gaming and your buddy
who's been into gaming forever it's like
yeah I download this razor coms thing
and then you get into gaming a little
bit more and you want to buy some
peripherals and you go to the store if
you see razor on the shelf what are you
gonna think you're probably gonna war by
the razor thing so these maps are
probably their intention then yeah and I
think they're doing some ads some ads
okay I mean if they run ads for the hot
new game or whatever else I think they
have enough relationships with
developers as it is I mean you look at
even the branded for a frills they do
someone will run advertising oh yeah if
they can get these I don't think they'll
have a problem with
so I'm not a hum percent sure but the
ads thing but I think I'm very cool so
there you go there you go guys razor
coms check it out I think it's razor
zone.com slash or razor zone dot yeah
razor zone.com slash whatever your
region is slash coms or something like
that so there you go that's what the
page looks like if you google razor coms
and that'll come up I didn't expect it
to be that good
especially after you said it just
completely crashed yeah that was like oh
whatever I'll test this out and me and a
buddy jumped on and then it was a
pleasant surprise so that was cool okay
so what's going on apparently the EA
shutdown PopCap Vancouver oh really
I remember when they did this but they
did it during something else okay so
that it wasn't like a major news item I
I don't know if they planned that they
probably didn't plan that but it
happened doing something else big going
on I don't know if it was the Boston
bombing or something but it was like
something really big was going on and
they shut down PopCap vancouver and laid
off 2,000 employees Wow and they're
planning a complete company restructure
so they planned to win the hearts back
of the community was to fire 2,000
people yeah so here we go Electronic
Arts this is on tech vibes that I'm on
right now Electronic Arts shuttering
PopCap and quicklime studios in
Vancouver sources say so this was yeah
on the 25th of April Electronic Arts dad
Ben here's a quote from again tech vibes
Electronic Arts dubbed the worst company
in America in both 2012 and 2013 laid
off 170 people in Montreal on April 11th
followed by this layoff which is let's
see if I can get an exact number here
internal memo something about a
restructuring Wow
wow that's terrible I mean how much how
could it come how could they have taken
something like PopCap and gotten it to
the point where they have to layoff a
whole team I mean PopCap was rolling in
money yeah it's really good
Wow I mean I feel terrible for the
people who were working for doing
something that was you know successful
and awesome and then you know in order
for ei to have a clean start in 2014 so
in 2011 ei bought PopCap for 1.3 billion
dollars and they've they make plants vs.
zombies and bejeweled blitz like those
are two huge games
I mean merchandising alone they should
be able to keep these people employed
sell some more zombie like climb out of
freakin zombie pushes and like walnut
hats that I saw it packs for a little
while there was insane everybody had a
little walnut thing now this is like
terrible news actually yeah it's never
good to see like buckets of people laid
off and it seems like every single time
you hear of layoffs in the gaming
industry it's like yeah EA just laid off
like quadruple figure yeah a acquired
something and then ran it into the
ground and just fired and layoffs
everyone like so there's the uplifting
story of the week I guess yeah that's
terrible that's no good let's get a new
way to this we can be happy yeah nothing
to say anymore that's just really really
crappy I like we're not even that fast
in the upkeep like that was a little
while ago yeah a couple weeks back yeah
yeah it's still crappy we just heard
about it so it's crappy to us at least
I'm sure it's still crappy to the yeah
okay well James makes a point
but PopCap made things for burden
tablets and phones and PCs and every
platform yeah there's actually I can't
think of a compelling reason it's not
like androids going somewhere except
like this yeah yeah if anything there
should be more opportunities for yeah
apparently there's the goal for comms is
to have only one ad and it's a banner at
the bottom and
getting this from my moderator chat so
let have one ad that'll probably a
really high value ad right and it's
probably just gonna chill the bottom
again probably won't be obtrusive cool
probably that's outstanding so go to
sixteen six ninety or a seventy nine
ninety bottlenecked by an eye 5:35 70 K
over five to 4.2 it doesn't really
matter because an eye 535 70 K right now
I mean who knows how things are gonna
change over the next month or so right
now is as fast as you can get anyway so
sure maybe it's bottleneck I don't know
what do you want me to tell you it has
not bottlenecked as it can be
every system everywhere the one the one
you're sitting in front of the one that
you used before that the one that's in
your parents room every system has a
bottleneck somewhere it's like people
ask me is this system bottlenecks yes
every system is bottlenecked it's about
reducing bottlenecks and making them not
as narrow as possible so for example a
system with a six core processor and a
GTX Titan is bottlenecked in every
situation is bottleneck by something
your system can only be as fast as the
slowest component and some component
will always be the slowest thing for any
given workload that's just how it works
so yes yes it will not be bottlenecked
any more than it would otherwise have to
be the only way to reduce that
bottleneck will be the overclock that 35
7uk even further so there what's in
yours and Slits personal rigs I'm
running a 3970 X I'm running a GTX 590
I've got eight gigs of RAM in there
right now cuz my memory was has been
borrowed bucks for a while I've got
eight 120 gig SSDs in a raid 0 array
that I back up nightly because that's
insane I have an XFX thousand watt 80 +
Platinum power supply and custom liquid
cooling go
to mine first no no tell them what you
have now of 2600 K and a 660ti with the
nen tricks 1200 watt true power which is
like massively actually beast absurdly
overkill and beast and unnecessary but
octane 256 gigabyte SSD which doesn't
back up do you really not have it set up
its backup it's just programs
oh I don't store any documents on there
at all okay it's just programs like I
could reset up that SSD mentality okay
don't bother and then I'd like big 2
terabyte drive which I do backup that
has all my games which I don't need to
back up so don't back up that folder but
then like all my documents and videos
and music and everything else on there
I'm what a missing 12 gigs of kind of
miss mix-matched ram half of its
dominators half of its like do you still
have that Amy on spec
nice key manga went out of business
years ago that was like 45 4 years ago
looks like a neon ran like a boss
totally awesome that was such a good
deal yeah I paid 10 bucks a gig for it
or something like back then for ddr3
yeah it's like ridiculous 800 D you
don't know do you
TTL 7 yeah alright um apparently there
are rumored GeForce GTX 780 we can't
really comment one way or the other
good night from Portugal good night
Portugal um first time watching live
loved the new schedule thank you have
you tried raidcall I haven't
unfortunately I have I don't mind it
again the group though wasn't known
right apparently if you put Skype on
busy it won't interrupt your game but it
also won't tell you things a lot of the
time so it's like it's like I either get
completely interrupted or I get no
notifications at all yeah damned if you
do damned if you don't
yeah kind of with that the thing I liked
about comms is and like another thing
with columns just little like ease of
life situations where if you call
someone it's like a deeper quieter tone
instead of freaking skypes like I'm
gonna kill your ears ringtone
which is not like being on the receiving
end of the Skype call isn't even as bad
as calling someone it's kind of bizarre
that you can't change it
and it's so Wow like I understand it's a
branding element for them do you always
know when a Skype calls dude but I mean
when you're going out it doesn't ring
that way when you're going out we're
like it's the annoying yeah super common
one and it's insanely loud when you're
going out it's terrible and really
annoying with columns it's actually
totally fine I don't know it's like it's
I guess it's not the biggest thing but
that's one of the first things I noticed
right was when I first called someone
else I go wow that's wasn't Kevin Norman
says he's watching on his Nexus for a
fantastic device smoothest he's used
however battery life is apparently not
satisfactory we've talked about NVIDIA
grid quite a few times we don't really
click links during the live stream just
because sometimes it's bad yeah
frostbite says apparently call quality
is 10 times better than Skype I haven't
experienced that okay he's come and
saying that about comms right okay so
let's uh let's sort of move on to our
next news topic of the day how much we
got these tabs open already we're gonna
do some community news items however we
have a bit of a public service
announcement right now with respect to
people posting community news items
because it's we do want to encourage
people to post news items on the Linus
tech tips forum in the news section it's
great we want that to be super active we
want anyone visiting the forum to be
able to go to the news section and kind
of be able to catch up on the tech news
that's awesome however we don't want to
run into a situation where Linus tech
tips forum looks like we're plagiarizing
in any way so don't copy paste the body
of text from someone that you're you're
pulling news from unless you're
surrounding it in a quote and I think a
basic requirement for posting in the
news section we should probably add this
to the guidelines yeah yeah is that you
should be contributing some of your own
take on it start the discussion up
yourself rather than just posting the
topic and then kind of leaving it there
say something about it post it quoted
appropriately and link to the source I
mean everyone's been linking to the
source really well as it is but we don't
want to run into a situation where we're
like bad guys because our forum
community posts copy-pasted news
articles from other websites I mean come
on those those websites were they just
copy-paste everyone else's stuff is like
we don't want we don't want to do that
don't want to be that the idea of the
news section is yes it should be nice
and fast like is already happening but
we've had cases where people are just
copying posting things from articles and
like he said try and start the
discussion okay so with all of that said
good bites contributed this article
where the verge is reporting that Intel
is claiming the new iris graphics
embedded in the upcoming Haswell CPUs
can offer double or even triple the
performance of Intel HD graphics 4000
that comes with current Ivy Bridge
processors there's a couple of couple of
things I'd like to comment on to start
with number one is that not all Ivy
Bridge processors have HD 4000 graphics
the lower end ones don't in fact it's
only the high end ones in many cases
which is ridiculous that have higher end
integrated graphics and it's like it
makes no sense because anyone buying
that CPU probably is running a dedicated
graphics card but that's that's the way
it's been so while it may be double or
triple in HD 4000 compared to whatever
you're running already it may be even
more than that so let's go back to back
to the graph and one thing is that it's
3d mark 11 Wow okay I was going there
okay so I want to point at bars on the
graphs so the dark blue one on the far
left this is 3d mark o6 3dmark Vantage
and 3d mark 11 so the one on the far
left is hold on
oh this color coding seems off okay well
whatever I'm pretty sure this is
supposed to be blue yeah I'm pretty sure
this is supposed to be HD 4000 and then
I'm pretty sure that one of these is
supposed to be oh crap no I looked at
this before
scores normalize
to the last gen and then I think it was
because there's going to be two
different levels of iris integrated
graphics as well so it's not just going
to be HD whatever on exactly the same
thing but apparently I'm getting
confused now so anyway here let's just
look at this so with the premium IRS
integrated graphics you're looking at up
to a two times increase over the last
gen product however I I would actually
look at something like 3d Marco six as
more of an indicator for something like
this because of a couple things so
number one is 3d marked 11 and 3dmark
Vantage are both going to perform
significantly better when you have more
features enabled on the hardware so iris
looks like it's probably a DirectX 11
part which doesn't mean that it's
necessarily twice as powerful but if it
has more features it'll inherently score
better on 3d mark 11 then a non DirectX
11 part whereas if you go back to Ivy
Bridge that was a DirectX 10 level part
so if you go back to a really old
benchmark like 3d mark go 6 then you are
looking at it as okay well let's take
away any advantage they get from an
updated feature set let's go based on
raw horsepower it looks like more of
maybe a forty to fifty percent
improvement and then 3d mark is often
very theoretical and so we might be
looking at a smaller improvement than
even that yeah but you know leave it -
leave it to 12 slick I was gonna say me
and slick to test it and let you guys
know what's actually up but in all
likelihood it'll probably be slick who
is figuring out how has well stacks up
we asked until this time around in the
past we'd only asked for K chips because
we know our audience is mostly
interested in that but actually we have
four Haswell chips I'm gonna run and
grab them I don't actually know why are
we doing that because of lower tvp's
levels of indicated graphics price
oh right okay I hope they heard that
yeah macho's not telling you so that we
can take these chips and we can compare
them to the actual appropriate market
competitor because it's one thing if we
take you know a 3770k and we compare
that to amd's APU and it's like okay
well it cost three times as much almost
four times as much and the lower end
Intel chip doesn't have the same onboard
graphics as a 3770k so this way we can
take something like a forty four thirty
which is one of the ones that we asked
for it and we can compare that against
the last generation products as well as
Amy's APs and let you guys know if you
want a low-end entry level gaming
experience on the cheap how well this
does has well actually stack up for you
so so yeah there you go
the verge is talking about this Intel
obviously those slides have Intel all
over them there's a nice big Intel logo
so I wonder where that came from
the only used blue and the whole slide
is blue so that's that's Intel spin on
it but we're gonna we're gonna check it
out we're gonna let you guys know what
I've seen already from some of the dye
shots so for those of you who don't know
the dye is the part of the CPU there's
there's a big metal piece on top the dye
is the actual silicon inside that
actually does all the work and from some
of the dye shots that I've seen the GPU
portion of Haswell is huge
yeah percentage-wise compared to Ivy
Bridge so I'm expecting a big
performance improvement but I just don't
know if it'll be that or if it'll be
something else all right you know depend
on the game depend on the drivers all
these things so let's move on to our
next community news topic this one is
was posted by Josie okay so there's a
picture of what is rumored to be the HTC
m4 so the HTC One is a phone that I have
been using for over a month now I
absolutely love it quite honestly I got
a samsung galaxy s4 about two weeks ago
and I haven't actually brought myself to
move my sim into it
yes that's kind of funny s4 has some
cool features we did use it for for like
a spot in the video where I'm getting a
call from someone and I wave at the
phone to answer it and it works and it's
cool
smart stays cool where it locks on to
your eyes and doesn't dim the screen
when you're reading things it's wicked
fast super fast the fact that they have
a built-in like I have power toggles on
my phone so I can quickly turn off my
Wi-Fi and do things like that but the
fact that they have a built-in power
toggles that's like this big and has
every setting you could possibly need on
the s4 it's really cool as well you know
nice and quick its efficiency minded but
I just love I'm an apple current convert
I came from an iPhone I want something
that feels like yeah it's like solid it
doesn't Bend I've dropped it it didn't
break more than once after helping a
couple that's got a couple dents on it
I'm like pretty far onto tile on the
tile I've dropped it it's happened these
things happen when I saw it he dropped
it from up here and it like hit a chair
like a wooden chair and then flipped
like crazy and smashing his style so
that was not cool I was not happy no
didn't scratch the screen fortunately
which is really nice he landed on the
screen right I landed on the edge or a
corner on the corner of the edge which
can be a sensitive spot yeah so so
anyway I'm excited about the m4 for a
couple reasons number one is if I had to
complain about something about the one
it's that it's still a little bit big
for me
I can use it one-handed it's extremely
awkward for me though I have small hands
the m4 is rumored to be a 4.3 inch
smartphone which will make it like Oh
that'd be perfect
there's a little bit speck chopped it is
so the rumoured specs it's still going
to be dual-core processor LTE capable 16
gig storage ultrapixel camera which is
nice to see because it really I actually
I took some I took a picture of the
other night of my baby playing with an
ethernet cable and someone on Instagram
was like
take that picture with the one because
considering how little light was in
there and how good it looked how much
detail there was it's awesome when you
compare the HTC One the ultra pixels to
something like a galaxy s4 in broad
daylight
the s4 destroys it because more pixels
if you can get the light to them will
give you a sharper image that you can
blow up to all you know living off them
can't you just often can't do it you
know it's funny people ask about the
marks on my Nexus neck in some videos I
don't think I saw me I scratched my neck
a little while ago my skin stays really
red for a long time you can see it in
there my skin stays really red for a
long time whenever I scratch it so a lot
of the time it's just like yeah and then
I end up with a weird mark on my neck um
so anyway 720p screen two gigs ram
they're saying similar build quality to
the HTC one go through the same
manufacturing process which is very cool
I think they have to cost it down
somewhat I would expect
well how much jeepers are gonna be I
don't know because you look at like the
ones already what a $1.99 with free year
term phone so maybe this will be a 99
with free year term phone Wow making I
mean would you consider something like
that if you were up for renewal or would
it go Nexus actually there that's a good
question what would you do guys I want
to hear from you on Twitter would you go
for build quality and construction and
speed of the device or support or would
you go for direct Android support and
stock Android experience what's more
important to you and why and I'll let
slick answer his question while we go
through that I don't know actually I
haven't have enough actual hands-on time
with the one and I haven't had any
actual hands-on time with the recent
Nexus phone okay you've heard me rave
about it though yes but again we haven't
touched any at all with the Nexus phone
but you know what your Nexus experience
was like compared to the Nexus S was my
favorite phone I ever owned okay so
knowing that would you would you just
kind of blindly go for it very possibly
the reason why I got necessary like I
like my history yeah but the reason why
I got one was because Nexus was not
available
right it wasn't because I actually chose
it over that my carrier did not have
anything else right I had like four
options okay like it was not that many
options and like s2 s2 was one of them
s3 yeah and then I don't have to
remember the other two but like it was
it was an s3 that I was gonna get
because it was clearly the best option
and at that time there was only two that
I would really want and it was Nexus or
s3 and I was gonna get the Nexus if I
could because of the amazing experience
I had the Nexus S right but I didn't
have the option and s3 was a really good
solution so okay well let's take it as a
more general thing then forget the one
forget the current gen Nexus would you
take the guarantee of software support
or would you take the beefy Hardware and
the nice feeling build quality what's
more important to you the device or the
software with mobile right now almost
the software you think so but what if I
mean honestly HTC has been one of the
more cooperative manufacturers in terms
of unlocking burners and I was just
gonna say with certain boot loaders and
stuff you might just be able to install
it yourself
so there's that if it's with HTC but
there's been certain phones that have
been problematic with that right so it's
it's interesting I have to do more
research on older HTC phones good to see
how they reacted to different things
okay right like their perspective on
people messing with their stuff
I suspect that with their current
attitude which is holy crap were
desperate we have to get the community
like on board they got to be on our side
we need to make this work probably fine
and I would probably end up going with
the one I mean looking at okay looking
at sort of the fact that they're even
launching an m4 is extremely encouraging
like as you guys probably know I have a
contact at HTC who provides us with
phones we've done some giveaways we do
we've done I switched with two of their
phones now the overall impression that I
get is they're extremely pleased with
demand and sales for the one which it
means they have some cash yeah which is
allowing them to produce something like
an m4 I mean they
we're so close to the edge or even
produce more ones or even produce more
one day we're so close to the edge they
couldn't get cameras for the one because
they weren't at tier 1 supplier anymore
whereas I suspect that's gonna change
over the next little bit with how much
excitement I mean did you see the anon
tech review of the s4 and the anon tech
review of the one yeah the entire one
review was basically slamming the s4 and
the entire s4 review was bull but wait
you could also get this other thing yeah
I was like really you guys did that
we got flamed because people were like
oh it wasn't that bad read between the
lines people it was that bad read
between the lines when a major
publication says that they mean like
like that's what they were doing and I
was like War ho but I mean you know it's
not like a major publication is gonna
not is gonna get snubbed on a future
galaxy device yeah if anything Samsung's
probably gonna come back with something
to prove I think they've proven time and
time again that they are resilient when
it comes to being dominant at things
it's like I mean where was Samsung for
TVs ten years ago five years ago yeah
now they're just like why would you buy
anything but a Samsung TV if you walked
into a store what would you buy what
would you buy oh okay we can talk about
that but okay okay I'm on 50 inch 50
inch 4k LED TV we're not buying a
Samsung TV - psycho sane shaky or
whatever it is like what was at $11.99
or $12.99 it was a living
1199 it's at a new low $1200 gets you a
4k TV and I think there was a shipping
promo on it from Tiger Direct at one
point Matt will group on its free
shipping group the Groupon is free
shipping is it still running I have no
idea okay guys I send it to you it's in
your email it's in my email okay okay
guys we're gonna we're gonna launch this
up for you because you can be 4k ready
nah probably might be psyche psyche safe
I didn't look at the name food safety
okay apparently this is still running so
I'm gonna look look three
shipping three returns so if there's
some kind of a problem okay
hold on hold on guys if you want a 4k TV
it's like oh we don't get any kind of
referral fee or anything for this so we
have we have no skin in the game when it
comes to whether you buy one of these oh
there's four hours left look at that Wow
so the timings perfect so you 411 that
should I just buy one right now oh I
just do it oh my god is that the
craziest thing ever that's pretty
freakin crazy
should I just do it what do you think no
okay
no that's slicks fault I didn't buy one
so my wife's gonna be super pleased with
you yeah but you got just under five
hours to buy a 4k TV for $1,200 now get
this uh I feel like that I feel like a
QVC right now for a limited time only
you can get this for four hours I'll be
shipping free returns I forget who it
was it wasn't in gadget might not have
been Gizmodo but I was reading an
article from one of the writers at a
fairly major publication like that like
I don't know if it was wired like it was
one of those guys and they were saying
this thing's actually kind of incredible
like it's not just a piece of crap and
you know what it's one of those things
where people see it and they go oh it's
too good to be true because the other
traditional manufacturers aren't doing
this but you know what they could they
could if either of us had the money I
would suggest that either of us bought
it just to like clear up twitchchat
being unhappy with me neither of us
should actually buy so okay but get this
this is a 1080p screen this notebook
entirely costs like 1,200 bucks so if
you can't manufacture for of the screen
for 1,200 bucks then you suck so they
can do it they just don't so some say
keys basically gone yeah we are gonna
screw the traditional market and we are
gonna drive pricing down we are gonna
buy market share by doing this and yeah
whatever everyone else yeah
come at me bro like I honestly I
wouldn't be
surprised if like say Keys Co gets like
assassinated like yeah amount of people
have been killed for less money than say
key just lost for Sony Samsung LG other
guys like that well over set there's
more than one person I've seen go by on
the twitch out I don't know how honest
this is but more than one person so far
other than wanting me fired for telling
you not to buy it but but more than one
person is gone gone by so far saying
that they bought it all right really
yeah Wow so Groupon should be giving us
money I don't think there's much margin
left in that you know Groupon kind of
removes all of the yeah reversing did
you actually just buy one I know one of
my twitch mods is saying that you just
bought one seriously oh that's crazy
yeah yeah apparently one of the twitch
mods just bought one so there you go
guys
Wow we should start you know what we
should figure out like affiliate
programs that are good and we should
actually tell these people deals that
don't suck because if we do like a deal
of the week or something all the week we
have to like make sure it doesn't suck
you know what guys okay we're gonna go
through the Twitter responses that I
asked for before but would you guys be
down if we found something this crazy
and we were getting a 3% cut or whatever
we were getting on it would you guys be
down to have us tell you that we found
it through a cool deal so there let us
know what you think because we would if
you guys even Wow twitch chat is twitch
chat is like extremely in support
because we don't want to be we don't
want to be QVC that's not what we are we
already do unboxings which as far as I'm
concerned is not that far away from
basically just video merchandising for
the product so apparently people are
Chad is very very into it which shed is
apparently pleased this single person
with this deal we present him twitch
chat is pleased so uh so there you go
let's um let's go back what question did
I ask on Twitter I actually don't
remember I don't remember anymore I was
like okay there's a lot of there's a lot
of Twitter okay so it's like you're
fired apparently what are your thoughts
on Google glass you know what this is
one of the topics I do want to talk
about later I think Google glass is a
great idea
and I don't really care about it at all
right now one thing we got to do build
bugs before the end of the stream oh wow
and I want to do a call-out for the
forum and something on the forum before
the hey I'm putting this down forum call
out build logs I'm adding that to make
sure we don't forget this stuff because
you know I felt like we started out a
little slow today but we have picked up
steam here so we'll talk about Google
glass okay right I asked about phone
software versus hardware so let's go
back and let's take some of these take
some of these callers caller you're on
the you're on Linus tech tips
I like the bebés at ten because I can
install apps from android I've heard
about that try that slows down is day
one video we're gonna upload it soon
I've heard that the support for it is
kind of funky okay so let's but I
haven't tried it yet so I'm gonna try
that and hopefully in a review soon
we'll get into that and Slick's I
switched he's doing a 30-day blackberry
a10 trial so no you can't don't you
can't RMA a card because it doesn't
overclock sorry sorry man how's the amyl
LED on the s4 tonight the amo LED on the
s4 is actually outstanding compared to
the s3 it doesn't have that same
blurriness it's still not quite like LCD
in terms of if you look at it under a
microscope but it looks pretty darn good
which socket should I get for an Intel
gaming rig I'd still go 1155 but if you
can hold off for about 30 days ah
cuz look should get one of those special
agent wired earpieces for when you're
sitting on the live stream I almost do
because I wear I don't wear it the whole
time but I have my first day forum them
member very nice
everyone should join the forum if you
haven't already Linus tech tips comm I
can transition from that into my forum
called we are serious business okay okay
hold that thought okay okay so this guy
says I'd go HTC one HTC one more more
batcher
he either means better or baller I'm not
quite sure which Samsung Galaxy s3 user
so far hate interacting with Sense UI
from HTC I'm with TouchWiz on this until
they improve so he's saying software is
a huge factor for him or she Jamie Jamie
Debose offers
as a nexus for owner I'd go for the
phone that gets updated first get all
the jellybeans okay
build quality I'm a skater and I've
broke him lots of phones there's an
interesting perspective that's a very
good point build quality with custom
firmware if it doesn't fit my needs talk
alright I have the Nexus 4 it isn't as
amazing as the HTC one well both sides
glass still feels good I prefer Nexus
device hardware quality is way more
important Eric so it looks like people
are very divided on this issue very
interesting it really depends on what
you do like the skater that was actually
one of my favorite comments late point
I'm a skater at Break phones okay he's
gonna want to weigh more durable for a
fantastic point mixer conversation what
do you guys think about bitcoins we're
actually gonna be starting a Bitcoin
mining pool on the forum at some point
so check it out
maybe it's complicated okay okay maybe
not
Andrew says of course build quality
wants the device to last at least if you
don't get a software update there's a
placement plate still work yes but like
you dropped your Nexus or s all over the
place like it wasn't bad build quality
it just wasn't like solid piece of
aluminum Deon says I build a software
because better software means a better
experience did Slick's s3 battery life
drop significantly after you updated to
jellybean you should talk about nine yep
definitely and then your forum thing
yeah it drops massively but it kind of
came back so tell them for about a week
or two my brother and I both had a
problem with a battery life when I
rescued he just completely tanked I have
a screenshot of my battery out telling
me I was at 20% battery life about five
minutes left and I was not super active
leaving my phone so that was kind of
nuts but then it's just kind of fixed so
I'm not actually entirely sure what even
happened look you were telling me the
other day that it seems like when you
charge it from the wall and I charge it
from the wall it actually seems to last
at a hundred percent charge on battery
reading at 100% if I charge it for a USB
to my computer compared to USB to my
wall USB from my computer it will last
drastically the last time then used to
be for the wall so guys s3 users let us
know if you've the same thing oh my god
someone make a post on the forum yeah
under mobile devices
let's figure out what's going on yeah
very very bizarre um so let's speaking
of the forum forum Paulo go okay so
first off I want to thank all my people
again mr. wizard for again making just
everything happen he's kind of a wizard
so mr. wizard if if he doesn't already
know is going to be getting some kind of
a beast gaming rig sometime in the next
couple months here for all the
contribution he's made he's we're gonna
hook him up with an AZ that's gonna have
raid 5 backup I don't think you've told
him this yet how do you know okay we're
gonna be hooking him up with an AZ
that's gonna have raid 5 backup cuz
right now he's using like 10 ghetto like
a couple hundred gig hard drives he's
cut a hole in part of his case and then
bent the metal back so that he could
shove a harddrive in there and then
right now he has the harddrive
kazekage's outside of his case because
they don't properly fit with some of his
hardware so he's like running long SATA
cables into his totally unacceptable
server for someone who's contributed
that much to the Linus tech tips for him
I mean the hours he's put in our
countless like days and days we haven't
paid him a penny and some dealt with not
to hate on people to know that we dealt
with v Bolton which was nuts yeah so we
already hooked them up with a five
ninety but we're gonna be following that
up with a full gaming rig at some point
here in the near future so uh so thank
you mr. wizard because we're doing
amazing things now IPS is awesome
everything's awesome thank you mod team
for sticking with us thank you to all
the members of the forum and the mod
team and mr. wizard again for sticking
with us through these crazy down times
we've been having a last little while
we're rolling out a solution that will
hopefully fix it but we'll talk about
that more maybe next livestream yeah
next nice tree not yet
and I want to do blank and folding
colors real quick
sure so boy oh there he goes
boink our world's reading is 1076 out of
almost a hundred thousand teams and we
climb about ten places a day so we're
doing great there are a Canadian ranking
is 42 out of almost 2200 teams Wow
sorting pretty great there as well a big
thanks to Ryan L booth
the bank team captain because he's been
doing awesome and contributing a ton at
this pace in about three and a half
months we should be 13th place in Canada
and 550th in the world
so boinks doing just awesome I had a
folding up date somewhere but I don't
remember where it is by the way there's
a shout out from the boy team to the
folding team as I like thank you for
being awesome and contributing your
gigahertz to a good cause
more Jigga hats hopefully whaler can
throw me a move on i have lots of topics
to volunteer so I am Diaz slashed prices
on CPUs and EP use they also launched a
couple products so check this out you
can get an a6 3600 which is a quad-core
APU if I were that's a quad-core isn't
it think so
I think so which is basically okay let's
look at the a8 3800 because that is a
decent CPU for under a hundred bucks
with a decent onboard GPU even the AAA
5600 K check that out under $100 that's
probably the one that I should have
talked about first because that is crazy
that's an unlocked chip so you can
overclock it it comes with the best
onboard graphics that you can get other
than I think the a-10 is clocked a
little bit higher but it's basically
there and have I mean quite frankly I
mean in our testing where we went 80 350
versus 35 70 K did you ever feel like
the 8350 was holding back your gaming
experience in some tangible way really
so yes the 35 70 K benchmarks better
it's faster and you know what quite
frankly I prefer Intel platforms because
I find I have fewer sort of random
driver issues whether it's with a SATA
driver when I swap out a bunch of stuff
I love rapid storage tech Intel's the
Intel's like SATA HDI manager it's
amazing makes my life better I use Intel
platforms I prefer them with that said
when we're talking about $100 for a chip
and a cheap fm2 board that will
basically get you a platform upgrade for
probably 200 bucks if you buy yourself
like four to eight gigs of RAM a cheap
board and an a8 and honestly why buy a
console the driver thing which you and I
have both brought up off screen before
but AMD's been making leaps and bounds
in the driver field show you that and
but the better driver assumption for
Intel I'm not talking graphics no so if
you're using onboard graphics ang gets
the nod there first sure I mean how much
experience do they have compared to the
insult when it comes to gaming and to
jump in line with the comment right
below this post actually yeah he's
talking about how especially like I
don't know if he actually brings this up
exactly but especially with next-gen
consoles coming out instead of rebuy
awhole set up it might be time to write
a gaming PC to move to gaming PC I mean
they've got the FX 8320 which is an
unlocked chip there's pretty much once
you overclock them pretty much no
performance disadvantage compared to an
80 350 that's an 8 core and the
wholesaler bulk pricing is 153 bucks I
mean this is like just earth-shattering
stuff it's awesome so so go AMD I don't
know if you guys saw this but AMD's to
stock prices gone like this so between
some of the new people they've been
acquiring between them beating their
projections between them being the
technology powering both major upcoming
consoles will all three they're the GPU
and the Wii U for that matter I mean I
said major consoles whether it was that
a slate at Nintendo I love Nintendo I'm
not gonna I'm not gonna beat up on them
but if EA developed a game for a
Nintendo platform then I'd still go
after that so that's the line for me but
but AMD's powering all that so AMD stock
has just exploded
which means hopefully a little bit more
well little bit a little bit more room
to breathe for they've been struggling
they for a little while there it was it
was looking like it might be game over
yeah which like I don't know what a game
over a MIDI would look like whether it's
selling all the patents or whether it's
acquisition early who knows something
terrible but it was looking like just
terrible terrible things we're gonna
happen so that's really exciting I'm
gonna jump back a little bit just to do
the folding team color so our current
rank worldwide is 212 which is insane we
have this bump to everyone who's a
member of the folding team you guys we
have 499 users which is insane and for
for all time okay
for all folding teams currently yeah we
have we're place 15th for active folders
Wow which is nuts that's crazy there's a
lot of insane there's a lot of folding
teams that have been around a lot longer
than us so that so to be ranked 15th for
active folders is just actually insane
so that's very cool good job everyone I
think I had left another I think I had
left another question for the Twitter
folks do you remember what it was okay
console players apparently don't want to
build pcs well we should educate them 4
p.m. time slot sucks for guys in our
time zone ironically but sorry guys we
got to do what we got to do apparently
we're number 41 in Canada cool
he said 42 well yeah there you go
i quarterly picked my rig for 4 members
um you know what I would like to do is
I'd like to do more like more giveaways
at some point but we got to figure out
the logistics because there's a lot of
laws involved that we've just kind of
ignored but Linus Media Group's an
actual company now not just some dude
with a YouTube channel so we have to be
we have to be careful the last thing I
want is to run across Canadian gaming
laws which would shut down my company
like that if they're like oh you're
running a lottery
therefore you are this this business in
this they could take everything yeah so
I got to be careful guys there's and
there's more to it than just loans
doesn't want to give things away just to
be clear yeah okay so according to what
would be something I'd watch the
livestream but I'm out skiing try and
get them to send you a free 4k TV oh
yeah I asked them if they wanted us to
do deals I joined the forums just
because you said so yes thank you just
because we said so he joined the forums
and joined Twitter just to say that
No thank you guys I mean it drives me
crazy when people are like I know it
says on your Facebook not to send you
messages here but I don't have twitter
so I sent you this message it's like
Twitter's free you don't have to do
anything other than just send me a
message on it like I'm not asking you to
marry it it's just that I can't handle
monitoring my private messages and my
emails and my Facebook and my Twitter
and actually making videos which is
priority number one is actually making
videos not talking about videos look in
the meme topic Maurier stuff on the
ninth page okay there we go okay
apparently apparently Twitter really
didn't have much to say about that so
there you go
it's gonna be hard to offer deals that
satisfy territories that's true all
those sites like Amazon may be an
exception
you're a lot of territories will be able
to get a benefit
Slick's blackberries dead ten things
will be coming up either tonight or
tomorrow so guys stay tuned and
apparently Logan's been doing something
similar with games on deals cool um do
you want to handle our brings of the
week I actually haven't looked at these
enough but this will be a counter
because working with this acute I'm I'm
I'm up then I'll do uh I'll do this
before we should do Rings of the week
yeah yeah but I can do this to solve for
some time for you okay okay so check
this out guys apparently and this was
posted by a mr. X on the forums Thank
You mr. X if there's a big Intel logo at
the top PC enthusiasts top PC top PC I
guess but the capitalization is a little
funny with cool or calm these guys
leaked everything because they get
access to all the good stuff
has apparently leaked a core i7 Ivy
bridge-e so this is a multi-core more
than four core ivy bridge based chip
that'll be coming around coming at some
point based on that there's already
benchmarks couldn't be that far off and
so this is a 49 60 X and this will be
replacing the 39 70 X I guess at that
thousand dollar price point on the
enthusiast x79 platform so remember guys
x79 is not going away it's still going
to be the enthusiast grade platform with
for dual 16x PCI Express Lanes more RAM
more course all that stuff is not going
away so pretty much the summary is it's
10% faster than the sandy bridge-e based
chips which is if we sort of know
anything about CPUs and sort of anything
then we probably saw this one coming so
there you have it ivy bridge-e just like
Ivy Bridge was compared to Sandy Bridge
is about ten percent better you can see
the overclock that they've got going on
so it's the 3.5 gigahertz overclock on
what appears to be let's see how many
physical cores we got here well I don't
even yep so there you go 6 cores 12
threads 3.3 gigahertz stock frequency -
tech tips takes no responsibility
we did not run these numbers we don't
have an ivy bridge-e apparently there's
going to be an X 79 a GD 45 + board
that'll support looks like the chipset
is picking up that sandy bridge-e
Southbridge X 79 so a lot of this data
may not be correct but there you have it
it's coming at some point guys so that
was pretty cool that I picked up on the
on the forum big thanks for posting that
on the forum here's another Linus tech
tips forum news topic this one was
posted by Josie Josie Jones I as well so
LG is launching the world's first 55
inch curved LED HDTV so this isn't going
to be 4k this is an HDTV it is 4.3
millimeters thick so guys if you look at
yeah yeah I'm just gonna zoom in on this
so you guys can get a better look at it
but Dad Finn this holy crap
Oh let'em it's its own light so what you
guys gotta remember is you don't have to
build a backlight array that goes behind
the panel anymore so the light emitting
is done by the pipe by the panel itself
in fact we did a demo at CES where I was
standing in front of a TV that was
sideways
and then we shifted the angle so you can
actually see you see the TV because you
could hardly even see it in the shot so
this isn't gonna be cheap I think the
initial quote is something like 13 grand
13,500 and will be available at 1400
retail locations pre-orders are
apparently started already so the
curvature gives you more of that IMAX
experience and the fact that all of the
screen is equal distance away from your
eyes in theory should make for a more
natural viewing experience however it
remains to be seen if content that was
developed with the intention of being
watched on a flat screen is actually
gonna even benefit from a curved screen
hey Buell what's your take on the whole
curb screen thing
okay so better for viewing angle mind
you oh LED doesn't really have that
problem I'm beat B roll the interns
actually over there he's been editing
videos the whole time we've been doing
this so it's a wait wait and see from
b-roll he's kind of our when it comes to
camera gear and H high-definition
content gear and all that stuff he's
he's our resident expert
whereas Diesel the intern is our
post-processing wizard not to take
anything away from mr. wizard but yeah
Diezel the intern is kind of dr. wizard
when it comes to some of the stuff he
does with video is amazing so they can
they can both be just Wizards as far as
I'm concerned ah
there's one more thing I wanted to talk
about very briefly just because I think
it's hilarious this was also posted by
Joe Zee however once again Joe Zee this
is kind of directed at you man make sure
you're posting some of your own original
stuff in these threads because otherwise
we become one of those one of those
Butthead sites so this is kind of weird
this is the Buddy Cup which allows you
to add friends to Facebook by bumping
glass with them glasses with them so
this isn't the kind of thing that anyone
really expects you to buy I don't think
the original link was from Engadget
just so you guys know so we're quoting a
source oh yeah and the original link for
the LG curved TVs was also a gadget so
this is the kind of thing that they'd
expect to be more like at an event where
you meet people whether it's how to
concert or whether it's at I don't know
a hockey game or something like that
where you meet someone you kind of go
yeah let's friend each other on Facebook
boom
I mean does this just make the Facebook
friend process that much more
meaningless yep I don't like it at all I
don't know but you don't use Facebook No
so you're all you already don't like it
before I even talk about it laughs I
guess that makes it not fair oh I don't
know I kind of see it's used in some
situations but I also see it being
abused but I like that guy that you
don't actually even like that's Randy
buddy me yeah yeah or I like walk up to
your glass and they're just like hit it
and it's like well okay I don't want
that to happen out what to like put my
cup down while I'm talking to someone
and have 10 people come by and like rub
their cups against you I don't know but
then I could also see the application
where if you're just out hanging out and
you genuinely meet someone that's pretty
cool it's really easy to just be like a
punk but then if you have smartphones
with NFC go bug I don't know I don't
really see the awesome appeal it's kind
of cool and his it's like it's kind of
it's interesting as one of those like oh
cool application of Technology I didn't
believe it and like if you went to a
some event and they had it there it
would probably be really cool as a
novelty as a novelty thing or whatever
so like I'm not actually against it I
just I personally wouldn't be too into
it but then again okay um so back to the
little glass
I personally based on the battery life I
think they were saying something like
what was it 30 minutes when you're
recording video or something ludicrous
like that I don't remember the exact
number but the battery life's not there
I'm personally not even remotely excited
about it yet but gen 3 or Gen 5 or gen
10 of this technology is gonna be just
incredible and I'll jump on the
bandwagon when instead of $1500 I can
buy it for a hundred and fifty bucks and
I don't have to be some special dude
with an and buy
and the functionality will be
dramatically better by then I also had
in one news item was that Google's
saying people are apparently hacks
Turing the Google glass and they
whatever they want but they're saying no
no no we meant to do that
which like I don't know how credible
that is but yes but from some people I
could see them being like oh no no we
meant to do that from Google though
Google usually leaves things of a lot ok
sure that's that's my view of that is
they often do um
now people are not also talking about
how apparently there might be like
remote shutoff and a whole bunch of
other weird stuff I don't know how true
this is so don't take this directly but
apparently Google has like quite a bit
of control over it still so removing
that might be interesting if that's even
real I don't know about that on the
comments of thread this is an article
from SourceFed which is oh I opened it
on the wrong thing I know I know we're
gonna we're gonna go a little bit
overtime today
ah so we'll do this and then we'll be
doing our our rigs of the week oh yeah
this was cool so this was interesting
speaking of Google and sort of all that
stuff this was on SourceFed it's who has
your back with respect to your privacy
so let's scroll down to the images to
chart yeah who has your back so the
requirements are requires a warrant for
content to share tells users about
government data requests publishes
transparency reports publishes a law
enforcement guidelines fights for users
privacy in courts and fights for users
privacy in Congress so there you go
Amazon only got 2 stars out of 6 and you
guys ok
I'm not saying that this chart is the
be-all and end-all by any stretch of the
imagination this is sourcefed's chart
and there you go but as a general
guideline it's kind of cool to look at
and it makes you really think about the
topic if nothing else Apple fights for
users privacy rights in Congress that's
it
AT&amp;amp;T very low rating comcast very low
rating Dropbox look at that huge so
other than fighting for users privacy
rights in courts they're requiring
warrants they're doing all the things by
the blog Facebook only got three stars
so no transparency
portes they don't tell you about a
government data request Foursquare is a
touch better than that Google scores
very well so this is why where I was
going with that
LinkedIn very well the only thing they
don't do is fight for it in court much
like Dropbox Microsoft not bad somewhere
in the middle ground here so the things
that they don't do is fight in court and
tell users about government data
requests MySpace it's like if you needed
a reason to not be on myspace anymore
there you go so there's the rest of them
Twitter is across the board sonic net
across the board um Verizon yeah not
looking too good yahoo not looking too
good so I just thought this was a really
cool article I wanted to make sure you
guys see it head over to SourceFed check
it out and let's do rigs of the week
shall we okay first one again not super
well-versed because these are kind of
huge but jump into the first one real
quick now this one has so this is from
pzt who's a junior member on the forum
this guy has 10 billion pictures okay
so we're probably gonna have to rip
through a little bit but yeah as we kind
of fly through here you can just see
lots of cool stuff a magnitude of
awesome stuff that is which is what are
those once you compressions
very nice yeah beautiful data they're
awesome on an Apple GHD white very nice
very nice if attack dual DDC block or
pump top yeah and the xt switch again
yeah gallon was nice choice
cool ants quick connects you'll see what
those are for
okay we're gonna have to just blow
through that's actually a ton of
pictures like fly through it quite a bit
and then when you start seeing certainty
yeah bite for it here we go that's he's
just starting there's a test fit ah very
nice he's putting quick connects on all
the components so that you can easily

thanks to everyone who tuned in to the
livestream this week by the way guys if
we don't mystic moon stick I hate this
keyboard it's very handy but it's also
like
hold on I don't remember how far I was
into my passwords guess we'll find out
nope that wasn't it I'm just in case you
guys don't know he's trying to login
that's why we're not showing the screen
right now are we not oh oh are you
typing numbers yeah it's okay though it
doesn't do that anymore
there we go okay I think I think my mod
they didn't see the first log of what
what they didn't see the first but that
wasn't over there
really oh no oh oops no my bad no okay
well let's go really quickly then we're
gonna show his build
oh sorry P Zed t I can't believe we did
that mural
I wonder how many tweets we have a few
at least oh come on it's not testing on
there for me okay so here's where we get
where did we get outside where he's
cutting the mid plate okay we missed
that part don't worry about it dude we
yeah anyway you can go check it out on
the forum guys that's always an option
if we screw things up I'll tweet out the
links for it yeah Dominator Platinum's
there we go yeah there we go there's the
mid plate cutting holes okay let's keep
on going very clean beautiful
peripherals that explains why like a
hundred people tuned out of the
livestream while we were doing this
because I thought it was a clue
ah sleeving great looking great looking
Ikea desk there nice themed build there
we go beautiful absolutely gorgeous so
badly it's amazing back played on the
video card mentioned this before I
apologize for the part where I mentioned
it and you couldn't actually look at it
just oh just sexy sleeving matching
motherboard matching the gelid wing fans
look fantastic in there all these little
shots of the inside just look
outstanding I mean look at the shininess
of this it's so awesome white LEDs using
the built-in like a switch eight ten
which is a really nice thing to have and
there we go now on to the second there
we are
alright so start scrolling down I'm
gonna tweet out that
for the bill dog another switch yeah
there you go
but very different bill whoo like very
different why hello there
t-virus in the back which is just
absolutely awesome t-virus is amazing
everyone should have a t-virus I'm like
the positions very cool and when you see
his desk setup
it even makes a lot more sense as to why
he put it where it is so this build is
very attainable I mean this is something
where no custom fabrication has been
done you know and CP six five five pump
you know nice nice water cooling and all
that but this is doable yep nice
pictures
yeah they got better here yeah baby they
get better pretty quick Kingston HyperX
memory looks good looking good
saber-tooth boards make for such a
clean-looking just look so awesome yeah
I've seen the upcoming saber-tooth yeah
yeah can't say anything about it though
alright some more night shots looking
good okay
I'm letting you do commentary on these
so so I was tweeting out that thing yeah
here you can see such there you're at
his desk you can see the t-virus yeah
instead of it being covered up by the
side panel because the window is
obviously not that big no it's not small
on the switch 810 yeah so by putting it
in the back you can actually join Steve
iris all the time so that's very cool
cuz most people will go oh just to the
right of the motherboard BAM there's my
wrist ball that's where mine is that's
that's where mine is but I can see mine
yeah I could see mine to my big window
but just because of how he has his desk
setup yeah his computer can hang off the
edge which is gonna sketchy but where
he's sitting he can actually see his tee
bars right which is very cool and very
understandable so that's a like awesome
obtainable level build the one before
that was more like that ridiculous
though ridiculously awesome level not
quite as obtainable okay guys thank you
for tuning in to the Linus tech tips
livestream which we're going to rename
at some point to something else there's
something that makes sense yeah
something that like we should ask for
suggestions on the floor we can ask for
suggestions but odds are we probably
won't take any of them
because you know it's just a matter you
know you want to come up with a brand
new that's really used well I mean you
guys are welcome to send suggestions via
a via Twitter or whatever else I'll
probably see them if nothing else yeah
so apparently I'm officially fired by
the viewers all right then yeah okay
yeah we both got hardcore fired all
right guys so don't forget join the
Linus tech tips forum it's kind of
awesome we're actually going to be doing
something soon where we're gonna release
the video on the YouTube channel where
we challenge you to make the Linus tech
tips forum your homepage whether it's
the news the news section or whether
it's just the home screen or the latest
latest topic section we are gonna be
working hard to make this an absolutely
awesome community we have some plans to
make the transition transition to home
screen seamless yep yep so we're working
on that I mean honestly if you have
anything you want to talk about tech
wise it's one of the most active forums
I have ever seen everyone gets a reply
and a comment we consistently get and
something we can try to consistently
uphold is that people are friendly yeah
so even if you're worried that it might
be a stupid question just ask how does a
good a good answer I had someone PM me I
this was a stupid question I didn't want
to ask it so I sent it to you in p.m.
and then he asked it and it was fine
yeah yeah no don't worry about it no one
will pile on you and if they do report
it we'll get it taken care of the
moderation team is absolutely amazing
good night everyone and we'll be back
you know it'll probably take us a little
while to get this set up but we'll be
back with some super mario world thanks
