live welcome to the linus tech tips live
stream featuring the one and only slick
pc in spite of that one guy who keeps
asking me to fire him I haven't done it
yet today today are those mine no oh my
god we both have the same ear buds which
causes no small amount of confusion
caused no small amount of confusion if
we ever put them in a pile next to each
other which would be a bit of a problem
so we're both using flux in your prose
what do you think huh I like them did
you ever try the non pros yeah I didn't
mind those they were good but i like how
well these will hook around your ear
right and how well they sit in your ear
the only complaint to have about the non
pros is like these ones they talked
about when we're in their suite that
they're designed after hearing aids
right yeah so they fit in your ear
really well and they don't really come
out of your ear that much right and then
the cable can go right up and around
your ear so there's not a lot of tension
with the non pros they're designed to
kind of stick out of your ear and then
go down slice Nick yes far out and then
go straight down you know what I
discovered though is that with the non
pros if you're really jam them in there
yeah I will hold on no no really though
that's that's why they're so long you're
supposed to I found if I put a size
smaller ear tip on it and then I put
them right in not only did they sound
great the noise isolation was
outstanding and they didn't stick out
really far anymore I was even able to
lie down on them without them being
uncomfortable so there there's so that's
pretty cool I didn't go that far with it
I don't like right right yeah fair
enough cuz they're more like in ear
canal almost yeah which is kind of weird
well it's not for everyone that's for
sure and wouldn't that be worse to for
your ears I mean if you cranked it may
be sure you know I would think so yeah
all right so what's our first topic for
the Lee sorry if my voice sucks guys I'm
kind of sick yeah I know it's a common
topic yeah sort of talked about that a
lot but yeah let's move on to a new
topic so our first topic of the week is
a tomb raider 2013 edition
is already fifty percent off on steam
it's not even the summer sale yet like I
kind of expected stuff like this in the
summer sale because the summer steam
summer sale always like just the most
ridiculous thing it's like please stay
inside and play video games I don't even
for a few months I've already started
doing this like a few months back and
for until the summer sale comes around
what I do is I'll actually for any games
that I hear of that I want and any games
that go on sale that I'm like oh that
looks interesting I put it in a list in
a notepad on my computer and I just wait
even if it goes on like a crazy weekend
only say oh I'm like now just put that
in the list wait for the summer sale
because it's so cheap it's basically
like like boxing boxing week or I guess
for the American viewers kind of like
like a black friday type thing it's kind
of it's kind of Awesome it's just not
worth while to buy anything any other
time yeah but I mean this comes back to
our discussion about Crysis 3 so that
came out and then it was discounted
within a couple weeks in spite of being
up evidently a hot-selling put title
should you preorder anything ever see
like at this point the main reason why
would ever see to preorder anything as
if you can find a place where you're
going to get some amount of benefit from
it because like sometimes steam will do
that oh if enough people pre-order and
you always hit the third tier and
there's three tiers of pre-order
benefits and sometimes like it comes
with other games right and it'll come
with like other games DLC like all the
stuff so sometimes the pre-order
benefits are really big and exclusive so
sometimes it's worth it I have bills hat
in left in Team Fortress 2 so you like
say stuff like that but that's I think
where the benefit of bar girly is gonna
be no because it's not price not priced
anymore yeah it's like two three weeks
four weeks after the after it actually
comes out it's already like yeah so
someone says ah yeah people are still
complaining about the audio levels I
actually don't understand okay here we
can try moving it a little closer
that might actually help so the mic yeah
we will try Whaley just said audio is
great I'll adjusted it a little bit ok
it's easier to turn down than it is for
people who are maxed out to turn it up
so I understand yeah I understand why
that's a problem why don't we turn to a
little bit of Twitter Q&amp;amp;A so let's go
ahead and do this OH oh yeah another
topic actually before we before we go
any further is our after party this week
assuming slick and I can get it working
we'll probably get it working right Oh
think so is gonna be our super mario
world live stream at least like the
start of it at least the started they
probably have to do more than one
segment yeah it's not gonna be in one
sitting I mean the reality of it is I
told my wife about the concept of the
super mario world live stream and she
was kind of like I mean you can't expect
wives to necessarily always get the
whole like game stream quite frankly I
don't really get the whole game
streaming thing but I mean it's more for
us we're not doing like a let's play
this is more of just we're doing at
normal we're probably going to be
talking about random stuff just like we
do in the after party yeah but just
instead of the whole screen being us
it'll probably be a small webcam view
and then Super Mario will I like who
doesn't like super wearable can I have a
lab candy of you what are you wearing
what that's true i can't see what your
way you're exposed knees are very
sensual haha exposed will slick wear
shorts to work which I mean I'm not the
best dressed gentleman wears sandals
that's true but sandals are very
practically were nice shirts when you
need to yes that is true if you're not
gonna be in front of camera you were
like badminton shirts and stuff yes
that's true you've really just don't
like how many shorts do you own ah a
couple they're all the same and i don't
like them i have three pairs of jean
shorts that i actually don't like cuz i
make my butt look big they're so that's
why you don't wear sure I love shorts
shorts are amazing
that actually could be part of the
reason alright so moving along to
Twitter Q&amp;amp;A ah watching from Norway but
not at a LAN party second time tuning in
from Austria I think this new timeslot
really does work well for a lot of a lot
of people really really well George says
apparently there's a giveaway of
leftover steam codes on the forum cool
that actually happens like a lot yeah
it's neat if you're if you don't have
many steam games like honestly hang
around the form there's there's one guy
that does steam giveaways all the time
for just drawing him random things
that's kind of cool and he'll pick like
not the best drawing at all he'll pick
like the thing that he just kind of
likes the most and usually it has
nothing to do with the best drawing at
all it's just what makes him laugh so
that's pretty cool I know one of our
mods has done a giveaway I know like
there's a lot of giveaways on before
eventually um speaking of giveaways on
the forum the user dragon tail submitted
a mass effect two steam car I think oh
crap i think it's an origin code yeah i
think it's an origin code but one way or
another it's a free copy of mass effect
2 that he sort of told me i could give
away on the live stream so instead i
opted to give it away on the forum in
the dented at that done I'm gonna see if
I can remember what my hot key is for
this one this whoops whoops whoops
whoops whoops whoops whoops oh no we'll
be back in a moment you do
what's going on there we go all right so
in this thread here called the post
Linus memes here thread which actually
has some pretty funny stuff okay this
one's not that great but basically the
winner selected by me and Slick is gonna
win a copy of mass effect 2 I think it's
just sort of for fun Twitter's up and
running and is gone love it I have to
keep going until I find my favorite one
I don't actually burst out laughing at
not much stuff I see on the internet but
this thread has got me going a couple
times yeah this threads actually just
kind of awesome but where is it here we
go here we go oh no oh yeah that one's
not bad almost not bad but there's
another slick one that I think is my
personal favorite so far I don't
remember where it is how remember it is
too I think it's pretty early on I like
this have you seen oh yeah yeah I saw
this one oh my goodness oh ok you know
what hold on we're gonna cut back to
back to us for a second vbulletin has
taken care of us at this point they've
issued a full refund so we are now
square with them it's all good yeah
still funny though this one's just
terrifying was weird I mean there's like
a black Linus I've never seen that
before okay I think it's got to be page
three cuz it was pretty early on um okay
hold on closed cell foam hold on hold on
trust me trust me it's worth it oh I
thought I was on page three okay close
cell phone yep yep yep yep final
assembly okay okay yeah no no did
someone get rid of it maybe that's
bizarre ok well there's a slick one that
we both saw that we both really liked
that i thought was quoted in here a few
times a lot of people talked about it
but it was basically slit giving a big
thumbs up with the caption EA at the
bottom and i have no idea what happened
here haven't seen somebody soon so
anyway
feel free to post on the thread you can
win a free copy of mass effect 2
courtesy of dragon tail one of the
members of our forum alright so back to
twitter right that's where we left off
cause like soon are you ready for
haswell we have Haswell chips we have
Haswell boards coming soon we had a
conversation with a sous that involves a
lot of a lot of really cool stuff
heading our way so we're gonna be
hopefully doing like some build guides
and some benchmarks and talking about
Haswell a whole a whole heck of a lot um
Andy wants to know when we're expecting
the nvidia 700 series we have no idea
and if we did we wouldn't be able to
tell you so if we did I would tell you
we have no idea so there you go that
should tell you all you need to know
slick have you tried far cry 3 blood
dragon yet no why not so well I don't
have a code yet oh well you have a never
settled yeah but they haven't sent it I
don't think never settle the center of
their codes yet so i'm waiting for never
settle to send out their codes and then
I will play the crap out of blood dragon
I'm so excited you saw like if I showed
you right yes is that as a gift or two
guys are fighting on the road and then
sub J ganic techno lizard just dives by
and takes the guy out just off so
excited this game it's so 80s oh my
goodness so excited ah so what's up with
Haswell what would you expect from
online gaming platforms in the future
we've talked about that a fair bit I
think already on previous live streams
fifteenth top post on the forums today
is apparently dylan grant nice awesome
yes super mario finally is coming here
do want to scooch forward a little bit
apparently you're a little out of focus
tuning in from sweden at 1am love it
guys thank you for tuning in and
apparently lots of new interactions oh
this is interesting so we got our hands
on a 7990 today but the only hands-on
time we had with it was to basically
just like video the card itself we
didn't actually get a chance to
bench market at all which was sort of
disappointing so that made me that made
me sad but hopefully we'll get a chance
to really benchmark it but the problem
with benchmarking the 7990 is that due
to the fact that it's running crossfire
and AMD's drivers aren't really
optimized for the best frame times the
frame rates might be really high but the
actual perceived performance is not
necessarily that high on a crossfire
solution right now and unless you have a
really high-end capture pc with some
special software and a lot of time to
sit down and and really go through frame
by frame what was actually being
displayed it's really hard to get
performance numbers for crossfire these
days until AMD fixes the issue they have
a prototype driver that looks a lot
better but it's nowhere near available
to the public yet so supposed to be like
twenty percent increase rate um a way
better way better not like in terms of
the perceived performance and the
perceived stuttering pneus of it it's
supposed to be absolutely way better can
you email that to me so that I can open
it up over there yeah all right so we
found and trying to get the user's name
we found the meme that was sort of mine
and mine and slicks favorite so far that
we done through a thread only to find
out like isn't there anymore for some
reason I had no idea why so we're gonna
bring that up soon oh we're gonna have a
guest next week I don't know if I told
you this yet vaguely mentioned something
but I don't actually know what's going
on ok so our guest here I'm just gonna
open up our livestream agenda here and
I'll take you to his website so he's a
bit of a local technology media
personality goes by the name of Steve
dotto so there you go he's got a website
he does more radio stuff he's he's a
little bit more focused on the business
side of the technology and how to how to
enable yourself to sort of save time and
make your life a little bit better with
it he doesn't focus on graphics cards or
stuff like that so I asked him to come
do a 20 minute segment or so he does a
lot of speaking engagements locally so
so yeah I had a meeting with him and he
was he was interested in
and joining us so I think it'll be
interesting to just kind of do the whole
guest thing again how it goes very
knowledgeable he's been doing yeah i
mean he's run um TV broadcast tech shows
in the past he's done online tech shows
like i said he does radio now extremely
experienced he's been doing tech talks
since I mean I basically knew where to
find the turbo button on a 386 or 486 or
whichever one was the one that came with
a turbo button or I can't even remember
anymore so so yeah that should be kind
of fun um I don't know how carefully
you've gone through some of the topics
that I submitted for the live stream but
have you seen this yet yeah crazy so
guys really knows check this out I don't
know what add that is this is from this
is from no film school com netflix
streaming loses two thousand titles as
universal and MGM licenses expire so
there's a lot of talk right now about
what the heck does this actually mean
and I'm gonna I'm gonna throw this at
slick and so what's your take on this I
cannot wait for Netflix and it's
actually pretty brutal that's so many
titles how 1794 1794 titles and I guess
the thing that sort of got a lot of
people scratching their heads right now
is that at the same time warner brothers
is launching their archival video
service yeah which is more focused on
older and obscure titles but there's
some overlap with the stuff that they
licensed just expired from netflix for
and it's like okay so you got your own
service now netflix is branching out
into content creation now like crazy
like crazy they're investing apparently
really liking it too so i mean at some
point in the future is is net does
netflix become pretty much the same as
any other content delivery company
except they were the kick in the pants
that forces the other guys to figure out
this whole digital content distribution
thing
the reason why everyone pirates
everything so maybe at some point I mean
what I what I've loved about netflix i
have only used netflix for i had it for
a few weeks because i'm a cheapskate and
i don't really watch movies okay i just
actually don't watch movies I've watched
one movie since my son was born and that
was over a year ago I went to see The
Hobbit how was it right okay so i don't
really watch movie so i didn't have it
for long but what i liked about it is
that you weren't locked into this
service or that service for that service
to the point where all of a sudden if
you're paying seven dollars a month for
ten different services it costs just as
much as a cable subscription which is
what i'm trying to get rid of yeah at
that point um so are we moving towards
more fragmentation where each of the
studio's maintains their own content
library is someone like YouTube gonna
win to a code where they get all the
original programming well it could
explode and then come back in because
they're doing the subscriber thing I
need to like everyone is trying to you
know how YouTube rolled out there like
you can set up your channels of
subscription base yes everyone is kind
of rolling out their own big content
subscription setup and I'm wondering if
everyone all the users are going to go
this is too much crap and like they're
gonna want to go back to just one group
of a beach art is more so maybe it's
going to get out of Netflix's hands for
a while and then someone whether it's
netflix or maybe someone else might be
able to pull it all back together
because it's gonna be frustrating
managing like 10 different subscriptions
for all your stuff that's just
ridiculous it's annoying that was nice
boosting like united states-based
Netflix Canadian Netflix was never
really that strong but United
states-based Netflix where you just kind
of had everything yeah almost all the
movies you think of tons of
documentaries all the show's almost and
quite frankly that's the kind of thing I
could see myself subscribe to wear as
Canadian netflix netflix really wasn't
that special yeah VPNs um yeah VPN true
enough but yeah so there's a lot of
there's a lot of stuff being pulled off
so things like so
hold on here we go so self park is is
off but it's not that big of a deal
because you can watch southpark online
legally anyway audrey Rose James Bond
classics like document fingers those are
still pretty good to watch so netflix
has take on this is you know what our
library has always been in flux we're
also adding i think they said they were
adding several yeah five hundred titles
are being added May first so that was
two days ago so they're losing almost
1800 but a lot of them are very possibly
super old that people possibly aren't
watching that how much so they're adding
bachelorette adding Hunger Games adding
mission impossible to I mean it's one of
those things where if you're subscribing
to netflix as a service that's kind of
like if I turn it on there will be
something to watch mission probably
accomplished as long as they can
maintain especially the state's one yeah
where I think this is going on yeah
because they have so much stuff which
actually reminds me um there was huge
news the other day that I actually
didn't have in our livestream in our
livestream document but I'm going to
open this up I just moved it over there
now so the first major youtube channel
acquisition just went down so DreamWorks
announced the acquisition of awesomeness
TV for 33 million which is absolutely
incredible so awesomeness TV was ahem ok
marked her peak and hold on yeah so he's
basically been involved in some other so
ok yeah here we go the key to this
success according to Tariq was Robin's
experience creating traditional
television content aimed at young
viewers such as Smallville and one tree
hill so they basically took this channel
they got one of YouTube's grants I think
they got three and a half yeah three and
a half million from the series a round
last summer which added to a 5 million
original content grant from YouTube so
they got a bunch of money to build this
channel they built it up to 500,000
subscribers and around 80 million
monthly views so this was on pando
dailies just so that we're citing our
source here they got it up to that level
and all
of a sudden is worth 33 million which is
incredible because this could be the
beginning of you know guys like I'm a
YouTube hasn't really said okay yeah
we're going to develop content we're
going to hire all the people and do it I
don't think they're interested in that
they want to be a platform but they've
started investing in content creators
whether it's Freddie Wong or whether
it's awesomeness TV or whoever else to
turn their platform into something that
major studios like DreamWorks are going
to walk in and buy and start being
content producers on youtubes platform
which makes room for premium channels
that people will actually legitimately I
think pay for interesting one thing like
freddie wong and stuff it almost sucks
at us named exactly after him cuz for
him he probably can't sell it uh or if
he did so I'd he'd have to stay a part
of it but that's what's going on here as
well oh he's doing a part of it he's
staying on board so him hold on let me
just when he just browse down I read
this sort of in with great interest last
last night which was yeah just it kind
of blew my mind so he's going to stay on
for I think it was can't see how long
but yeah so so Robbins is staying on and
he's going to be continuing to to
develop it under DreamWorks of course if
they're acquiring it for 33 million they
probably have some more money earmarked
to continue to invest in it and make it
more awesome but what I figure based on
this is that I must be a millionaire i'm
worth about 4 million views a month on
Linus tech tips so I figure it works out
perfectly such a been so you can just
extrapolate and so no yeah okay I guess
our production values aren't really
there that's never really been our
strength has it no no no I guess it I'm
like the sale of a tech channel on
youtube I don't think is quite as much
as like an original content creator we
create original content well about yeah
fair enough but not exactly the same
problem either way the you know between
looking at sort of Netflix is constant
at
inflow of their content as well as I
mean this whole thing where YouTube
channels might turn into TV channels
yeah I hope that happens as soon as
possible which is just crazy yeah which
is just absolutely crazy I mean
YouTube's been they've been doing all
this stuff I mean they've been they've
been one step ahead yeah we need to
support live we need to support this we
need to support that we need to
incentivize content creators to stay on
this platform it's like they support
things I'm like EA Wow okay yeah I guess
we're we're half an hour in I guess I
had to throw if it wasn't that it wasn't
that early for for a shot at EA um
speaking of speaking of EA did you did
you put that name in here no I can't
edit the dog did you email it to me I
think so at some point yeah there it is
okay so here we go guys so this was this
was the mean that's like and I were
looking for before so it's basically
just that's the entire punchline that's
all the punchline we need how every joke
on their live stream and did one yeah
and they never sponsored linus tech tips
ever speaking of which EA if you'd like
to sponsorship is you would like to
sponsor us just getting can't go for
it okay in germany apparently youtube
created some original channels that are
paid by YouTube to create high-quality
content um well I mean okay they had by
YouTube yeah if they're paid by YouTube
and they actually hire people who
actually get a paycheck then that's a
little bit different from what we've
seen over here so there you go seems I
can't watch because my sister took the
tablet it's okay the archive will go up
right away this week we'll be back to
the usual way of doing it the problem
was that we had to wait for twitches
archive which we could then download and
chop together in windows live movie
maker and then we had to wait for it to
upload and then we had to wait to put in
all the time stamps it was just a really
really glad way of doing it before
hopefully it'll actually stay as one
this time hi Andrew welcome to watching
the live stream photo lie
um what's your opinion on the Nexus 4 I
don't know I haven't heard much about it
it just seems like it kind of was there
and people were really excited about it
I 5 heard sales are really good but like
it's not a huge talking point I mean
it's an android block android device but
honestly nexus s also wasn't a huge
talking point lots of had them yeah but
it wasn't a huge talking point I think
quite a few people have nexus for us as
well well by comparison you look at how
much someone like a samsung is bending
the best advertising yeah so because
Samsung is pushing all their phones
Google doesn't really do a little bit
well I think the login page for gmail
now has something about I didn't even
look at it but I saw a phone so maybe
they're doing something but like the
advertising push behind Samsung is so
much bigger making it a talking point
right now I mean you have to look at it
from Google's perspective is why are you
gonna push their hard work hardware
platform so hard when ultimately it was
partners like Samsung that made Android
a success that were willing to build the
hardware before Google run around to it
yeah um so yeah I mean and the other
thing to those with faster more modern
devices like the HTC One and the samsung
galaxy s4 hitting the market being
available now there is a unique
experience with nexus two places though
okay I brought this up with my nexus s I
went through three major platform
changes with that phone like that was
crazy and like right when it's announced
as released it's all my phone right and
that's one thing with the nexus ones you
always get the updates cuz you're
getting pushed from google which is kind
of fantastic just that like awesome
support that you expect from frankly
being attached to google right let's
talk about this so a razor has launched
their comm software it's in beta right
now um I tried to install it and it
basically just kind of closed so I kind
of gave up because i was going to test
it with slick but what I discovered is
that when I reinstall it might have been
a problem actually with my audio drivers
I updated the firmware on my x1 and the
drivers and everything's working a
hundred percent now so it might not have
been comms problem but I haven't tried
it yet personally but I sent this late
link over to slick so what are they
trying to do here exactly um I think
they're trying to replace skype because
the interface style like you know
there's the like ventrilo teamspeak kind
of style where there's a server and you
join a disconnect from the server and
there's chat rooms and all that kind of
stuff yeah it's not set up like that
right which is why a lot of gamers have
started using skype instead of yeah the
complicated setup that goes into back
that's honestly I still kind of like i
like i like mumble I love mumble was the
same kind of thing though yeah the same
kind of thing oh hmm right we have
something else to talk about but I will
continue this topping until we're done
sorry just a mod chat reminding me about
a serious serious thing going on sorry
for that segue I'll come back so it has
the social pain just like Skype does
where it shows everyone on your friends
list so on the left side I'm looking on
his everyone on your friends list on the
left side and then you can open up chat
groups super super easily and you can
save those chat groups so you can kind
of make channels kind of behind safe
chat groups okay so you have like your
team for whatever game you can save them
all as a chat group are we screaming
this page okay so let's see team Diablo
yeah so he's got a chat group gone
apparently there's a channel with in
there I haven't used it enough I'm sorry
guys I guess you can maybe within
individual chat groups make channels
it's kind of interesting so that's cool
option to do there for like general
feedback on its performance it's auto
detected settings I'm finding are not
quite as good at skype with skype as far
as i can tell anyone just clicks call
and it works right like as long as you
have the right device pointing out and
stuff it just works with when it calms
yeah you used it for a while i think we
had up to six people on it and all we
noticed that is that maybe you had to
turn one dude up maybe had to slightly
turn your own mic down or up but it
wasn't like it wasn't crazy hardcore
settings it was up or glider one slider
okay not a big deal anyone can do this
fairly easy level settings like I had a
fan in my room pointed directly at a
desktop Mike so you would expect it to
pick it up and it was a little bit but
it doesn't in skype but then I just
turned to the slider down a little bit
and it was totally fine I see so the
auto detect isn't quite as awesome
escape but it's super super easy to tune
in so that's awesome one big problem
that a lot of skype users especially
myself hate is that if we're in a game
someone calls you like the crazy
annoying guy is so loud it's insanely
loud and it will probably put an overlay
on your screen or it'll tabeo to your
game like if someone hangs up the call
you might get tabbed out of your game
and your whole call ends if it's the
person who started the call and like
there's all these kind of major problems
this one it will now transfer the host
oh that's cool we think we tried it and
then are really really loud high-pitched
noise came in and then everyone could
hear each other but it was kind of
crackly okay but it isn't it is in beta
that's one big takeaway people need to
understand it is in beta beta and that's
not like the audio codec or anything so
right okay might just deal with that for
now it'll hopefully be fixed so I think
it's supposed to transfer the host in
the call if you get a call you don't
really get a call and again if you get a
call in a game it'll come up in the
bottom right hand corner it will not
have you out it'll pop up like a steamer
xfire overlay okay if anyone knows about
that it has a key command just like
steamer xfire so you can bind it to I
think whatever you want but it's a
control tab okay church it's still kind
of sucks cuz crouching and then check
your score right but you could change it
to but I think ninety-nine percent sure
you can change it I don't know why you
wouldn't be able to I haven't changed it
yet but I will so that's kind of nice
very unobtrusive while you're in games
which escapes problem right and then the
audio is not quite as good but after a
few seconds you can get there so okay
yeah what I actually like it a lot so
far so I think I'm gonna kind of make
the jump really i've been using skype
river i'm still gonna use skype for text
chat for a lot of people just because i
have more people in skype right um
but yeah for comms in games I hate skype
it pisses me off because it constantly
Tad's me out and just is a massive
annoys so what's the impression you said
you had six people on what is it
everyone's kind of down with it we've
tried a lot of different voice chats
most of the guys most the guys that
haven't been gaming as long as say like
my brother and I like the skype style
where it's a friends list yeah more than
the old channel based vent kind of style
right so we've been using skype for a
while but none of us have been totally
satisfied because of it tapping it out
of games and stuff I've been looking for
a different solution but there hasn't
really been one quite as good so usually
we'll all download the new thing that
comes out try it for a little bit and
everyone bails and goes back to skype
everyone's actually been consistently
using comms since we downloaded it so I
wonder what's the benefit to razor to
create this uh branding I guess I think
they're doing ads on it okay so there's
that yeah price sorry apparently their
their intention I mean you know it's
soul but they're brandings all over it
so if you're using comms for all your
games and you go to a store and you're
you're if you're just getting into
gaming and your buddy who's been into
gaming forever it's like yeah I download
this razer comms thing and then you get
into gaming a little bit more and you
want to buy some peripherals and you go
to the store if you see razor on the
shelf what are you going to think you're
probably gonna work by the razor thing
so he's magic probably their intention
then yeah and i think they're doing some
ads some ads okay I mean if they run ads
for the hot new game or whatever else I
think they have enough relationships
with developers as it is I mean you look
at even the branded for a frills they do
someone will run advertising oh yeah if
they can get these I don't think they'll
have a problem with getting ads so I'm
not a home person sure with ads thing
but I think I'm very cool so there you
got there you go guys razer comms check
it out i think that's razor zone.com /
or razor zone dot yeah razor zone.com /
whatever your region is / comms or
something like that so there you go
that's what the page looks like if you
google razer comms and that'll come up
just a bit I didn't expect it to be that
good especially after you said it just
completely crashed yeah I was like oh
whatever i'll test this out and me and a
buddy jumped on and then it
was a pleasant surprise so that was cool
um okay so uh huh what's going on
apparently the EA shut down popcap
Vancouver oh really I remember when they
did this but they did it during
something else okay so that it wasn't
like a major news item but I don't know
if they planned that I probably didn't
plan that but it happened doing
something else big going on I don't know
if it was the Boston bombing or
something but it was like something
really big was going on and they shut
down popcap Vancouver and laid off 2,000
employees Wow and they're planning a
complete company restructure so they
plan to win the hearts back of the
community was to fire two thousand
people just probably don't know oh yeah
so here we go electronic arts this is on
tech vibes that I'm on right now
Electronic Arts shuttering popcap and
quicklime studios in Vancouver sources
say so this was yeah on the twenty-fifth
of April hmm um Electronic Arts dub
here's a quote from again tech vibes
Electronic Arts dubbed the worst company
in America on both 2012 in 2013 laid off
170 people in montreal on april eleventh
followed by this layoff which is let's
see if i can get an exact number here
internal memo something about a
restructuring wow wow that's terrible I
mean how much uh how could it come how
could they have taken something like
popcap and gotten it to the point where
they have to lay off a whole team I me
popcap was rolling in money yays really
good at killing things Wow I mean I feel
terrible for the people who were working
for doing something that was you know
successful and awesome and then you know
in order for EA to have a clean start in
2014 so in 2011 EA bought popcap for 1.3
billion dollars and they've they make
plants vs zombies and
bejeweled blitz like those are two huge
games yeah I mean merchandising alone
they should be able to keep these people
employed sell some more zombie like
climb Mount of freaking zombie pushes
and like walnut hats that I saw it packs
for a little while there was insane
everybody had a little walnut thing yeah
this is like terrible news actually yeah
it's never good to see like buckets of
people laid off and it seems like every
single time you hear of layoffs in the
gaming industry it's like yeah EA just
laid off like quadruple figure yeah yeah
I acquired something and then ran it
into the ground and just fired her and
lay off everyone like oh well so there's
the uplifting story of the week I guess
yeah that's terrible um I don't know so
that's no good let's get a new way to
this we can be happy yeah I have nothing
to say anymore that's just seems really
really crappy I like we're not even that
fast in the upkeep like that was a
little while ago yeah this a couple
weeks back yeah LOL totally crappy yeah
it's still crappy we just heard about it
so it's crappy to us at least i'm sure
it's still crappy to the uh yeah okay
well James makes a point but popcap made
things for Vern tablets and phones PCs
and every platform yeah there's actually
I can't think of a compelling reason
it's not like androids going somewhere
accepts like this yeah yeah yeah if
anything there should be more
opportunities for ya apparently there's
the goal for comms is to have only one
AD and it's a banner at the bottom I'm
getting this from my moderator chat so I
have one ad that'll probably a really
high value add right and it's probably
just gonna chill the bottom again
probably won't be obtrusive cool
probably be fine yeah that's outstanding
um so what a 16-6 90 or a 7990 be
bottlenecked by an i5 3570k overclocked
to 4.2 um it doesn't really matter
because an i5 3570k right now I mean who
knows how things are going to change
over the next month or so right now is
this
you can get anyway so sure maybe it's
bottleneck I don't know what do you want
me to tell you it has not bottlenecked
as it can be every system every where
the one moving the one you're sitting in
front of the one that you use before
that the one that's in your parents room
every system has a bottleneck somewhere
it's like people ask me is the system
bottleneck yes every system is
bottlenecked it's about reducing
bottlenecks and making them not as
narrow as possible so for example a
system with a six core processor and a
gtx titan is bottlenecked in every
situation is bottleneck by something
your system can only be as fast as the
slowest component and some component
will always be the slowest thing for any
given workload that's just how it works
so yes yes it will not be bottlenecked
any more than it would otherwise have to
be the only way to reduce that
bottleneck will be to overclock that
3570k even further so there what's in
yours and slicks personal rigs well i'm
running a 39 70 x i'm running a gtx 590
I've got eight gigs of ram in there
right now because my memory was has been
borrowed books for a while I've got
eight 120 gig SSDs in a raid 0 array
that I back up nightly because that's
insane I have an XFX thousand-watt 80
plus platinum power supply and custom
liquid cooling go oh I have to do things
to mine first no no tell them what you
have now of 2600 k and a 660 Ti with an
N tricked 1200 watt true power which is
like massively actually beast absurdly
overkill and beast and unnecessary at
octane 256 gigabyte SSD which doesn't
back up do you really not have it set up
backup it's just programs oh I don't
store any documents a little okay it's
just programs like I could reset up that
SSD and I
okay I don't bother um and then I'd like
big two terabyte drive which I do backup
that has all my games which I don't need
to back up so don't back up that folder
but then like all my documents and
videos and music and everything else on
there what I missing 12 gigs of kind of
Miss mix-matched Ram half of its
dominators half of its like uh do you
still have that Amy on stuff habits in
your nice qimonda went out of business
years ago that was like 45 four years
ago he looks like a neon ran like a boss
totally awesome that was such a good
deal yeah I paid 10 bucks a gig for it
or something like back then for ddr3
yeah that's so sweet yeah it's like
ridiculous um and then 800d you don't do
t GL 7 yeah all right um apparently
there are rumored geforce gtx 780 we
can't really comment one way or the
other goodnight from portugal goodnight
portugal mhm um first time watching live
love the new schedule thank you have you
tried raidcall i haven't unfortunately I
have I don't mind it again the group
though was it now right apparently if
you put skype on busy it won't interrupt
your game but it also won't tell you
things a lot of the time so it's like
it's like I either get completely
interrupted or I get no notifications at
all damned if you do damned if you don't
yeah kind of with that the thing I liked
about comms is and like another thing
with columns just little like ease of
life situations where if you call
someone it's like a deeper quieter tone
instead of freaking skypes like I'm
gonna kill your ears ring tone which is
not like being on the receiving end of
the skype call isn't even as bad as
calling someone it's kind of bizarre
that you can't change it and it's so Wow
like I understand it's a branding
element for them you always know when a
skype calls dude but I mean when you're
going out it doesn't ring that way when
you're going out we're like it's the
annoying yeah super common one and it's
insanely loud when you're going out it's
terrible and really annoying
with coms it's actually totally fine I
don't know it's like it's I guess it's
not the biggest thing but that's one of
the first things I noticed right cuz
when i first called someone else i go
wow that's wasn't Kevin Norman says he's
watching on his nexus for a fantastic
device smoothest he's used however
battery life is apparently not
satisfactory we've talked about nvidia
grid quite a few times we don't really
click links during the live stream just
cuz sometimes it's bad yeah um frostbite
says apparently call quality is ten
times better than skype i haven't
experienced that okay he's come to
saying that about comms right okay so
let's uh let's sort of move on to our
next news topic of the day i kind of
wish we had these tabs open already
we're going to do some community news
items however we have a bit of a public
service announcement right now with
respect to people posting community news
items because yeah it's we do want to
encourage people to post news items on
the linus tech tips for them in the news
section it's great we want that to be
super active we want anyone visiting the
forum to be able to go to the news
section and kind of be able to catch up
on the tech news that's awesome however
we don't want to run into a situation
where linus tech tips forum looks like
we're plagiarizing in any way so don't
copy paste the body of text from someone
that you're you're pulling news from
unless you're surrounding it in a quote
and i think a basic requirement for
posting in the news section we should
probably add this to the we're
guidelines yeah yeah is that you should
be contributing some of your own take on
it start the discussion up yourself
rather than just posting the topic and
then kind of leaving it there so say
something about it post it quoted
appropriately and link to the source i
mean everyone's been linking to the
source really well as it is but we don't
want to run into a situation where we're
like bad guys because our forum
community posts copy pasted news
articles from other websites i mean come
on those those websites were they just
copy paste everyone else's stuff is like
we don't we don't want to do that
there's gonna be that the idea of the
news
section is yes it should be nice and
fast like is already happening but we've
had cases where people are just copying
posting things from articles and like he
said try and start the discussion okay
so with all of that said good bites
contributed this article where the verge
is reporting that Intel is claiming the
new iris graphics embedded in the
upcoming Haswell CPUs can offer double
or even triple the performance of intel
HD graphics 4000 that comes with current
ivy bridge processor so a couple of
couple of things I'd like to comment on
to start with number one is that not all
Ivy Bridge processors have HD 4000
graphics the lower end ones don't in
fact it's only the high-end ones in many
cases which is ridiculous that have
higher end integrated graphics and it's
like it makes no sense because anyone
buying that cpu probably is running a
dedicated graphics card but that's
that's the way it's been so while it may
be double or triple in HD 4000 compared
to whatever you're running already it
may be even more than that so let's go
back to back to the graph and one thing
is that it's 3dmark11 well okay I was
gone there okay i wasn't so i want to
point at bars on the graphs so the dark
blue one on the far left this is 3dmark
06 3dmark vantage and 3dmark11 so the
one on the far left is um hold on oh
this color coding seems off okay well
whatever i'm pretty sure this is close
to Gilley's other than just shades of
blue yeah I'm pretty sure this is
supposed to be HD 4000 and then I'm
pretty sure that one of these is
supposed to be all crap no I looked at
this before scores normalized to the
last gen and then I think it was because
there's going to be two different levels
of iris integrated graphics as well so
it's not just going to be HD whatever on
exactly the same thing ah but apparently
I'm getting confused now so anyway here
let's just look at this so with the
premium iris integrated graphics you're
looking at up to a two times increase
over the last
gen product however I I would actually
look at something like 3dmark 06 as more
of an indicator for something like this
because of a couple things so number one
is 3dmark11 and 3dmark vantage are both
going to perform significantly better
when you have more features enabled on
the hardware so iris looks like it's
probably a directx 11 part which doesn't
mean that it's necessarily twice as
powerful but if it has more features
it'll inherently score better on
3dmark11 then an on directx 11 part
where as if you go back to ivy bridge
that was a directx 10 level part so if
you go back to a really old benchmark
like 3dmark 06 then you are looking at
it as okay well let's take away any
advantage they get from an updated
feature set let's go based on raw
horsepower it looks like more of maybe a
forty to fifty percent improvement and
then 3dmark is often very theoretical
and so we might be looking at a smaller
improvement than even that yeah but you
know leave it to leave it to 12 slick i
was gonna say me and Slick to test it
and let you guys know what's actually up
but in all likelihood it'll probably be
slick who is figuring out how has well
stacks up we asked until this time
around in the past we'd only asked for K
chips because we know our audience is
mostly interested in that but actually
we have for haswell chips I'm gonna run
and grab them um so that we can tell you
guys not probably calorie though okay
you tell them so that why we're doing
that um I don't actually know why are we
doing that because of lower TDP s know
so we can evaluate lot of the lower
levels of indicated graphics price oh
right okay I hope they heard that yeah
machos not telling it so that we can
take these chips and we can compare them
to the actual appropriate market
competitor because it's one thing if we
take you know a 3770k and we compare
that to amd's apu and it's like okay
well it cost three times as much almost
four times as much and the lower end
intel chip doesn't have the same onboard
graphics as
87 70 k so this way we can take
something like a 4430 which is one of
the ones that we asked for and we can
compare that against the last generation
products as well as Amy's aps and let
you guys know if you want a low-end
entry-level gaming experience on the
cheap how well does does has well
actually stack up for you so so yeah
there you go The Verge is talking about
this Intel obviously those slides have
Intel all over them there's a nice big
Intel logo so I wonder where that came
from the only used blue and the whole
slide is blue so that's that's Intel
spin on it but we're gonna we're gonna
check it out we're gonna let you guys
know what I've seen already from some of
the dye shots so for those of you who
don't know the dye is the part of the
CPU there's there's a big metal piece on
top the dye is the actual silicon inside
that actually does all the work and from
some of the dye shots that I've seen the
GPU portion of Haswell is huge yeah
percentage-wise compared to ivy bridge
so I'm expecting a big performance
improvement but I just don't know if
it'll be that or if it'll be something
else right you know depend on the game
depend on the drivers all these things
so let's move on to our next community
news topic this one is that Dada was
posted by Josie ok so there's a picture
of what is rumored to be the HTC m4 so
the HTC One is a phone that i have been
using for over a month now i absolutely
love it quite honestly I got a samsung
galaxy s4 about two weeks ago and I
haven't actually brought myself to move
my sim into it yet that's actually kind
of funny s4 has some cool features we
did use it for for like a spot in the
video where I'm getting a call from
someone and I wave at the phone to
answer it and it works and it's cool
smart stays cool where it locks onto
your eyes and doesn't dim the screen
when you're reading things it's wicked
fast super fast the fact that they have
a built-in like I have power toggles on
my phone so
I can quickly turn off my Wi-Fi and do
things like that but the fact that they
have a built-in power toggles that's
like this big and has every setting you
could possibly need on the s4 is really
cool as well you know nice and quick its
efficiency minded but I just love I'm an
apple kind of convert I came from an
iphone I want something that feels like
yeah it's like solid it doesn't Bend
I've dropped it it didn't break more
than once I've dropped me a couple
that's got a couple dents on it I'm like
pretty far on to tile on a tile I've
dropped it it's happened these things
happen when I saw it he dropped it from
up here and it like hit a chair like a
wooden chair and then flipped like crazy
and smashing his style so that was not
cool I was not happy no didn't scratch
the screen fortunately which is really
nice I think it landed on the screen
right I landed on the edge or corner on
the corner of the edge which can be a
sensitive spot so so anyway I'm excited
about the m4 for a couple reasons number
one is if I had to complain about
something about the one it's that it's
still a little bit big for me I can use
it one-handed it's extremely awkward for
me though I have small hands the m4 is
rumored to be a 4.3 inch smartphone
which will make it like oh oh that like
that even move that'd be perfect doesn't
it a little bit spec chopped it is so
the rumored specs it's still going to be
dual core processor lte-capable 16 gig
storage ultrapixel camera which is nice
to see because it really I actually I
took some I took a picture of the other
night of my baby playing with an
ethernet cable and someone on Instagram
was like did you take that picture with
the one because considering how little
light was in there and how good it
looked how much detail there was it's
awesome when you compare the HTC One the
ultrapixels to something like a galaxy
s4 in broad daylight the s4 destroys it
because more pixels if you can get the
light to them will give you a sharper
image that you can blow up to all you
know oblivion off
can't you just often can't do it um you
know it's funny people ask about the
marks on my neck neck in some videos I
don't think I saw me I scratch my neck a
little while ago my skin stays really
read for a long time you can see it in
there my skin stays really read for a
long time whenever I scratch it so a lot
of the time it's just like yeah and then
i end up with a weird mark on my neck um
so anyway 720p screen ah two gigs ram
they're saying similar build quality to
the HTC One they're gonna go through the
same manufacturing process which is very
cool I think they have to cost it down
somewhat I would expect well how much
she purrs are gonna be I don't know
because you look at like the ones
already what a 199 with free year term
phone so maybe this will be a 99 with
three year term phone Wow making I mean
would you consider something like that
if you were up for renewal or will you
go Nexus actually there that's a good
question what would you do guys I want
to hear from you on Twitter would you go
for build quality and construction and
speed of the device or support or would
you go for direct android support and
stock Android experience what's more
important to you and why and I'll let
slick answer his question while we go
through that I don't know actually I
haven't have enough actual hands-on time
with a one and I haven't had any actual
hands-on time with the recent Nexus
phone okay you've heard me rave about it
though yes but again but how to attach
any at all with the Nexus phone but you
know what your Nexus experience was like
compared to the other Nexus S was my
favorite phone I ever owned okay so
knowing that would you would you just
kind of blindly go for it yes very
possibly the reason why i got ness three
like I like my has three yeah but the
reason why I got one was because Nexus
was not available right it wasn't
because I actually chose it over that my
carrier did not have anything else right
I had like four options okay like it was
not that many options and like s2 s2 was
one of them s3 yeah and then I don't
have to remember the other two but like
it was it was an s3 that I was going to
get because it was clearly the best
option and at that time there was only
two that I would really want and it was
Nexus or s3 and I was going to get the
nexus if I could
because of the amazing experience I had
in excess right but I didn't have the
option and s3 was a really good solution
so okay well let's take it as a more
general thing then forget the one forget
the current-gen Nexus would you take the
guarantee of software support or would
you take the beefy hardware and the nice
feeling build quality what's more
important to you the device or the
software Oh with mobile right now yeah
almost the software you think so but
what if I mean honestly HTC has been one
of the more cooperative manufacturers in
terms of unlocking beat writers and I
was just gonna say with certainty
blowers and stuff you might just be able
to install it yourself so there's that
if it's with HTC but there's been
certain phones that have been
problematic with that right so it's
interesting I have to do more research
on older HTC phones or who to see how
they reacted two different things okay
right like their perspective on people
messing with their stuff I suspect that
with their current attitude which is
holy crap were desperate we have to get
the community like on board they got to
be on our side we need to make this work
probable to be fine and I would probably
end up going with the one I mean looking
at okay looking at sort of the fact that
they're even launching an m4 is
extremely encouraging like as you guys
probably know I have a contact at HTC
who provides us with phones we've done
some giveaways we do we've done I
switched with two of their phones now
the overall impression that I get is
they're extremely pleased with demand
and sales for the one which it means
they have some cash yeah which is
allowing them to produce something like
an m4 I mean they were so close to the
edge or even produce more once or even
produce more one they were so close to
the edge they couldn't get cameras for
the one because they weren't two Tier
one supplier anymore whereas I suspect
that's gonna change over the next little
bit with how much excitement I mean did
you see the anon tech review of the s4
and the anon tech review of the one yeah
the entire one review was basically
slamming the s4 and the entire s4 review
was bull but wait you could also get
this other
yeah I was like really you guys did that
we got flamed because people were like
oh I wasn't that bad read between the
lines people it was that bad read
between the lines when a major
publication says that they mean like
like that's what they were doing yeah
yeah and I was like war ho but I mean
you know it's not like a major
publication is gonna not is gonna get
snubbed on a future galaxy device yeah
if anything Samsung's probably gonna
come back with something to prove I
think they've proven time and time again
that they are resilient when it comes to
being dominant at things it's like I
mean where was samsung for TVs 10 years
ago five years ago yeah now they're just
like why would you buy anything but a
samsung TV if you walked into a store
why would you buy not a samsung TV what
would you buy what is it consists psyche
psycho oh okay we can talk about that
but ok ok I'm month ago 50 inch 50 inch
4k LED TV I'm not buying a samsung TV
I'm a psycho he is saying say key or
whatever it is like ooh what was it was
at eleven ninety nine or twelve ninety
nine it was a living on 1199 it's at a
new low twelve hundred dollars gets you

promo on it from tigerdirect at one
point met will groupon it's free
shipping group the group on his special
day shipping is it still running I have
no idea okay guys I send it to you it's
in your email it's in my email okay okay
guys we're gonna we're gonna launch this
up for you because you can be 4k ready
nah really might be psyche psyche say I
didn't look at the neighborhood safety
okay apparently this is still running so
I'm gonna look look free shipping free
returns so if there's some kind of a
problem okay hold on hold on guys if you
want a 4k TV it's like oh we don't get
any kind of referral fee or anything for
this so we have we have no skin in the
game when it comes to whether you buy
one of these oh there's four hours left
look at that whoa so the timings perfect
so you 411 that should i just buy one
right now oh my goodness I just do it
my god is that the craziest thing ever
that's pretty freaking crazy should I
just do it what do you think no okay no
that's licks fault I didn't buy one so
my wife's gonna be super pleased with
you yeah but you got just under five
hours to buy a 4k TV for pull hundred
dollars now get this uh I feel like that
I feel like QVC right now for a limited
time only you can get this for me for
hours I'm free shipping free returns I
forget who it was it wasn't in gadget
might not have been gizmodo but I was
reading an article from one of the
writers at a fairly major publication
like that like I don't know if it was
wired like it was one of those guys and
they were saying this thing's actually
kind of incredible like it's not just a
piece of crap and you know what it's one
of those things where people see it in
they go oh it's too good to be true
because the other traditional
manufacturers aren't doing this but you
know what they could they could if
either of us had the money i would
suggest that either of us bought it just
to like clear up twitch chat being
unhappy with me neither of us should
actually buy yeah I don't really have
the money right now no so okay but get
this this is a 1080p screen this
notebook entirely costs like 1,200 bucks
so if you can't manufacture for of the
screen for 1,200 bucks than you suck so
they could do it they just don't so so
say keys basically gone yeah we are
gonna screw the traditional market and
we are gonna drive pricing down we're
gonna buy market share by doing this and
yeah whatever everyone else yeah come at
me bro like I honestly I wouldn't be
surprised if like say Keys CEO gets like
assassinated like yeah the mountain
people have been killed for less money
than seiki just lost for sony samsung LG
other guys like that converse it there's
more than one person I've seen go by on
the twitch out i don't know how honest
this is but more than one person so far
other than wanting me fired for telling
you not to buy
but but more than one person is gone
gone by so far saying that they bought
it really yeah wow so groupon should be
giving us mind you I don't think there's
much margin left in that you know
groupon kind of removes all of the
largest yeah reversing did you actually
just buy one I know one of my twitch
mods is saying that you just bought one
seriously oh that's crazy yeah yeah
apparently one of the twitch mods just
bought one so there you go guys whoa we
should start you know what we should
figure out like affiliate programs that
are good and we should actually tell
these people deals that don't suck
because if we do like a deal of the week
or something a week or we have to like
make sure it doesn't suck you know what
guys okay we're gonna go through the
Twitter responses that I asked for
before but would you guys be down if we
found something this crazy and we were
getting a three percent cut or whatever
we were getting on it would you guys be
down to have us tell you that we found
it through a cool deal so there let us
know what you think because weird if you
guys even Wow twitch on is twitch chat
is like extremely in support because we
don't want to be we don't want to be QVC
that's not what we are we already do
unboxings which as far as I'm concerned
is not that far away from basically just
video merchandising for the product so
apparently people are chad is very very
into it but shed is apparently pleased I
haven't later this single person's with
this deal we presented twitch chat is
pleased so uh so there you go let's um
let's go back what question did I asked
on Twitter I actually don't remember I
don't remember anymore i was like by 4k
TV okay there's a lot of there's a lot
of twitter okay so slick you're fired
apparently yeah um what are your
thoughts on google glass you know what
this is one of the topics i do want to
talk about later I think Google glass is
a great idea and I don't really care
about it at all right now one thing we
gotta do build bugs before the end of
the stream oh wow and I want to do a
call out for the forum and something on
the forum before the MA I'm putting this
down forum call out build logs I'm
adding that to make sure we don't forget
this stuff cuz you know I felt like we
started out a little slow today but we
have picked up some 15
here so we'll talk about google glass
okay right I asked about phone software
versus hardware so let's go back and
let's take some of these take some of
these callers caller you're on the
you're on Linus tech tips um I like the
BB z10 because i can install apps from
android I've heard about that try that
oslo's done is day one video we're gonna
upload it soon I've heard that the
support for it is kind of funky okay so
let's uh but I haven't tried it yet so
I'm gonna try that and hopefully in a
review soon I will be talking we'll get
into that and slicks i switched he's
doing a 30-day blackberry 10 trial so um
no you can't you can't are ameya card
because it doesn't overclock sorry sorry
man how's the amyl LED on the s4 tonight
the mo LED on the s4 is actually
outstanding compared to the s3 it
doesn't have that same blurriness it's
still not quite like LCD in terms of if
you look at it under a microscope but it
looks pretty darn good which socket
should i get for an intel gaming rig I'd
still go 1155 but if you can hold off
for about 30 days ah this lets you get
one of those special agent wired your
pieces for when you're sitting on the
live stream I almost do because I where
I don't wear it the whole time but i
have my ear proof first day forum them
member very nice everyone should join
the forum if you haven't already linus
tech tips com i can transition from that
into my forum called we are serious
business uh ok ok hold that thought cuz
ok ok so this guy says I'd go HTC one
HTC one more more batcher he either
means better or baller I'm not quite
sure which um samsung galaxy s3 users so
far hate interacting with sense UI from
HTC I'm with TouchWiz on this until they
improve so he's saying software is a
huge factor for him or she Jamie Jamie
Debose offers very easily as a nexus for
owner I'd go for the phone that gets
updated first get all the jelly beans
okay build quality I'm a skater and I've
broke him lots of phones there's an
interesting perspective that's a very
good point build quality with custom
firmware if it doesn't fit my needs talk
all right I have a nexus 4 it isn't as
amazing as the HTC One well both sides
glass still feels good I prefer Nexus
device hardware quality is way more
important
so it looks like people are very divided
on this issue very interesting it really
depends on what you do like the skater
that was actually one of my favorite
comments wait point I'm a skater a break
phones okay he's gonna want to weigh
more durable for a fantastic point like
so conversation what do you guys think
about bitcoins we're actually gonna be
starting a Bitcoin mining pool on the
forum at some point so check it out
maybe its course more not complicated
okay okay maybe not andrew says of
course build quality wants the device to
last at least if you don't get a
software update the device plate still
work yes but like but you dropped your
Nexus alas all over the place Hans like
it wasn't bad build quality it just
wasn't like solid piece aluminum Dion
says i'd go with software because better
software means a better experience did
slicks s3 battery life drop
significantly after he updated to
jellybean you should talk about nine yep
definitely um and then your farm thing
then reform thing yeah it drops
massively but it kind of came back so
tell me for about a week or two my
brother and i both had a problem with a
battery life on rs3 just completely
tanked I have a screenshot of my battery
out telling me i was at twenty percent
battery life about five minutes left and
I was not super active leaving my phone
so that was kind of nuts um but then
it's just kind of fixed so i'm not
actually entirely sure what even
happened look you were telling me the
other day that it seems like when you
charge it from the wall and i charged it
from the wall it actually seems to last
at a hundred percent charge on battery
reading at one hundred percent if i
charged it from USB to my computer
compared to USB to my wall USB from my
computer it will last drastically look
last time then USB from the wall so guys
s3 users let us know if you serve the
same thing don't make us one make a post
on forum yeah under mobile devices story
with us let's figure out what's going on
yeah very very bizarre um so let's
speaking of the forum forum fellow go
okay so first off i want to thank all my
people again mr. wizard for again making
just everything happened he's kind of a
wizard so mr. wizard if if he doesn't
already know is going to be getting some
kind of a beast gaming rig
time in the next couple months here for
all the contribution he's made he's were
gonna hook him up with an AZ that's
gonna have raid5 back up I don't think
you've told him this yet have you know
okay we're gonna be hooking him up with
Nazz that's gonna have raid5 back up cuz
right now he's using like ten ghetto
like couple hundred gig hard drive he's
cut a hole in part of his case and then
bent the metal back so he could shove a
hard drive in there and then right now
he has the hard drive case cages outside
of his case because they don't properly
fit with some of his hardware so he's
like running long SATA cables into his
kids totally unacceptable for someone
who's contributed that much to the linus
tech tips from I mean the hours he's put
in our countless like days and days and
days and days and days name we haven't
paid him a penny and some dealt with not
to hate on people to know that he it was
a refund dealt with v Bolton which was
nuts yeah so we already hooked him up
with a 59 me but we're gonna be
following that up with a full gaming rig
at some point here in the near future so
so thank you mr. wizard because we're
doing amazing things now IPS is awesome
everything's awesome thank you mod team
for sticking with us thank you to all
the members of the forum and the mod
team and mr. wizard again for sticking
with us through these crazy down times
we've been having a last little while
we're rolling out a solution that will
hopefully fix it but we'll talk about
that more maybe next live stream ya next
nice Trey not yet and I want to do boink
and folding kaulitz real quick sure so
boy oh there he goes boink our world
reading is 1076 out of almost a hundred
thousand teams and we climb about ten
places a day so we're doing great there
are a Canadian ranking is 42 out of
almost 2200 teams Wow starting pretty
great there as well a big thanks to Ryan
l booth from the blank team captain
because he's been doing awesome and
contributing a ton at this pace in about
three and a half months we should be
thirteenth place in Canada and five
hundred fiftieth in the world so boinks
doing just awesome I had a folding
update somewhere but I don't remember
where it is by the way there's a shout
out from the boy team to the folding
team as I like thank you for being
awesome and contributing
your gigahertz to a good cause more
jigga hats hopefully whaler can throw me
a folding up to eat here because I don't
remember what I think well I can move on
I have lots of topics to volunteer so I
am Diaz slashed prices on CPUs NDP use
they also launched a couple products so
check this out you can get an a6 30 600
which is a quad-core APU if I work
that's a quad-core isn't it think so I
think so which is basically okay let's
look at the a8 3800 because that is a
decent cpu for under a hundred bucks
with a decent onboard GPU even the AAA
5600 k check that out under a hundred
dollars that's probably the one that i
should have talked about first because
that is crazy that's an unlocked chip so
you can overclock it it comes with the
best onboard graphics that you can get
other than I think the a-10 is clocked a
little bit higher but it's basically
there and have I mean quite frankly I
mean in our testing where we went in
8350 versus 3570k did you ever feel like
the 8350 was holding back your gaming
experience in some tangible way not
really so yes the 3570k benchmarks
better it's faster and you know what
quite frankly I prefer Intel platforms
because I find I have fewer sort of
random driver issues whether it's with a
SATA driver when I swap out a bunch of
stuff I love rapid storagetek Intel's
the Intel's like SATA ahci manager it's
amazing makes my life better I use until
platforms I prefer them with that said
when we're talking about a hundred
dollars for a chip and a cheap fm2 board
that will basically get you a platform
upgrade for probably 200 bucks if you by
yourself like four to eight gigs of ram
a cheap board and an a8 and honestly why
buy a console the driver thing which you
and I have both brought up off screen
before but AMD's been making leaps and
bounds in the driver field show you that
and
the better driver assumption for Intel
I'm not talking graphics no so if you're
using onboard graphics AMG gets the nod
there for sure I mean how much
experience do they have compared to the
Intel when it comes to gaming and to
jump in line with the comment right
below this post actually yeah he's
talking about how especially like I
don't know if he actually brings this up
exactly but especially with next-gen
consoles coming out instead of rebuy
awhole setup it might be happy times
right a gaming PC to move to gaming PC I
mean they've got the FX 8320 which is an
unlocked chip there's pretty much once
you overclock them pretty much no
performance disadvantage compared to an
8350 that's an eight-core and the
wholesaler bulk pricing is the 153 bucks
I mean this is like just
earth-shattering stuff it's awesome so
so go AMD I don't know if you guys saw
this but AMD's to stock price has gone
like this so between some of the new
people they've been acquiring between
them beating their projections between
them being the technology powering both
major upcoming consoles will all three
there the GPU and the Wii U for that
matter I mean my said major consoles
where the was that a slight at Nintendo
I love Nintendo I'm not gonna I'm not
going to beat up on them but if EA
developed a game for a Nintendo platform
then I'd still go after that so that's
the line for me but um but AMD is
powering all that so AMD stock has just
exploded which means hopefully a little
bit more well little bit a little bit
more room to breathe for they've been
struggling bay for a little while there
it was it was looking like it might be
game over yeah which like pretty bad
like I don't know what a game over md
would look like whether it's selling all
the patents or whether its acquisition
or like who knows something terrible but
it was looking like just terrible
terrible things we're gonna happen so
that's really exciting I'm gonna jump
back a little bit just to do the folding
team color so a current rank worldwide
is 212 which is insane we have this bump
to everyone who's a member of the
folding team you guys we have 499 users
which is insane and for for all time
or overall okay for all folding teams
currently yeah we have where place 15th
for active folders Wow which is nuts
that's crazy there's a lot of me insane
there's a lot of folding teams that have
been around a lot longer than us so
that's 0 to be ranked 15th for active
folders is just actually insane so
that's very cool good job everyone I
think I had left another i think i had
left another question for the twitter
folks do you remember what it was okay
console players apparently don't want to
build pcs well we should educate them
for p.m. timeslot sucks for guys in our
time zone ironically but sorry guys we
gotta do what we gotta do apparently
we're number 41 in Canada cool he said
42 well that yeah there you go if that
was from awhile ago I quarterly pimp my
rig for four members um you know what I
would like to do is I'd like to do more
like more giveaways at some point but we
got to figure out the logistics because
there's a lot of laws involved that
we've just kind of ignored but Linus
Media Group's an actual company now not
just some dude with a youtube channel so
we have to be we have to be careful the
last thing I want is to run across
Canadian gaming laws which would shut
down my company like that if they're
like oh you're running a lottery
therefore you are this this business in
this that could take everything yeah so
I got to be careful guys there's and
there's more to it than just loathe
doesn't want to give things away just to
be clear yeah uh okay so according to
what would the something I'd watched the
live stream but I'm out skiing try and
get them to send you a free 4k TV oh
yeah I asked them if they wanted us to
do deals i joined the forearms just
because you said so yes thank you just
because we said so he joined the forums
and joined twitter just to say this no
thank you guys i mean it drives me crazy
when people are like oh no it says on
your facebook not to send you messages
here but i don't have twitter so i set
you this message it's like Twitter's
free you don't have to do anything other
than just send me a message on it like
I'm not asking you to marry it it's just
that I can't handle monitoring my
private messages and my emails and my
Facebook and my Twitter and actually
making videos which is priority number
one is
actually making videos not talking about
videos um look in the meme topic Maurier
stuff on the night page okay there we go
okay apparently apparently Twitter
really didn't have much to say about
that so there you go it's going to be
hard to offer deals that satisfying
territories that's true although sites
like Amazon may be an exception you're a
lot of territories will be able to get a
benefit um Slick's blackberry z10 thing
will be coming up either tonight or
tomorrow so guys stay tuned and
apparently Logan's been doing something
similar with games on deals cool um do
you want to handle our Briggs of the
week I actually haven't looked at these
enough but this will be academy class I
was working with this cute i'm i'm i'm
up then I'll do uh I'll do that what we
should do rings of the week yeah yeah
but I can do this to solve for some time
for you okay okay so check this out guys
apparently and this was posted by a mr.
X on the forest Thank You mr. X there's
a big Intel logo at the top pc
enthusiasts top PC top pc iguess but the
capitalization is a little funny but
with cool alikom these guys leak
everything because they get access to
all the good stuff has apparently leaked
a core i7 ivy bridge-e so this is a
multi-core more than four core Ivy
Bridge based chip that will be coming
around coming at some point based on
that there's already benchmarks couldn't
be that far off and so this is a 49 60 X
and this will be replacing the 39 70 x I
guess at that thousand dollar price
point on the enthusiast x79 platform so
remember guys x79 is not going away it's
still going to be the enthusiast grade
platform with support for dual 16 x pci
express lanes more ram more course all
that stuff is not going away so pretty
much the summary is it's ten percent
faster than the sandy bridge-e based
chips which is if we sort of know
anything about cpus and sort of anything
then we probably saw this one coming
so there you have it ivy bridge-e just
like Ivy Bridge was compared to Sandy
Bridge is about ten percent better you
can see the overclock that they've got
going on so it's a 3.5 gigahertz
overclock on what appears to be let's
see how many physical cores we got here
well I don't even yep so there you go
six cores 12 threads three point three
gigahertz stock frequency ah Linus tech
tips takes no responses we don't have an
ivy bridge-e apparently there's going to
be an x79 a GD 45 plus board that will
support looks like the chipset is
picking up as sandy bridge-e southbridge
x79 so a lot of this data may not be
correct but there you have it it's
coming at some point guys so that was
pretty cool that I picked up on the on
the forum big thanks for posting that on
the form here's another Linus tech tips
forum news topic this one was posted by
Josie Josie Josie as well so LG is
launching the world's first 55-inch
curved Oh LED HDTV so this isn't going
to be 4k this is an HDTV it is four
point three millimeters thick so guys if
you look at ya here I'm just going to
zoom in on this you guys can get a
better look at it but dad Finn this holy
crap oh let emits its own light so what
you guys got to remember is you don't
have to build a backlight array that
goes behind the panel anymore so the
light emitting is done by the pipe by
the panel itself in fact we did a demo
at CES where I was standing in front of
a TV that was sideways and then we
shifted the angle so you could actually
see you see the TV because you could
hardly even see it in the shot so this
isn't going to be cheap I think the
initial quote is something like 13 grand
13,500 and will be available at 1400
retail locations pre-orders are
apparently started already so the
curvature gives you more of that IMAX
experience and the fact that all of the
screen is equal
distance away from your eyes in theory
should make for a more natural viewing
experience however it remains to be seen
if content that was developed with the
intention of being watched on a flat
screen is actually going to even benefit
from a curved screen hey Buell what's
your take on the whole curved screen
thing well I understand like you can
help viewing angle okay so better for
viewing angle mind you Oh LED doesn't
really have that problem Abby b-roll the
interns actually over there he's been
editing videos the whole time we've been
doing this I don't know enough about it
to see the full benefit okay wait until
you see it in so it's a wait wait and
see from b-roll he's kind of our when it
comes to camera gear and aged
high-definition content gear and all
that stuff he's he's our resident expert
whereas diesel the intern is our
post-processing wizard not to take
anything away from mr. wizard but yeah
diesel the intern is kind of doctor
wizard when it comes to kind of some of
the stuff he does with video is amazing
so they can they can both be just
Wizards as far as I'm concerned there's
one more thing I wanted to talk about
very briefly just because I think it's
hilarious this was also posted by Josie
however once again Josie this is kind of
directed at you man make sure you're
posting some of your own original stuff
in these threads because otherwise we
become one of those one of those
butthead sites so um this is kind of
weird this is the buddy cup which allows
you to add friends to Facebook by
bumping glass with them glasses with
them so this isn't the kind of thing
that anyone really expects you to buy I
don't think the original link was from
engadget just so you guys know so we're
quoting a source oh yeah and the
original link for the LG curved TVs was
also engadget um so this is the kind of
thing that they'd expect to be more like
at an event where you meet people
whether it's how to concert or whether
it's at I don't know a hockey game or
something like that where you need
someone you kind of go yeah let's friend
each other on Facebook boom I mean does
this just make the facebook friend
process that
or meaningless yep I don't like it at
all I don't know but you don't use
facebook no so you're all you already
don't like it before I even talked about
it last guess that makes it not fair um
I don't know I kind of see it's used in
some situations but I also see it being
abused by like that guy that you don't
actually even like that Randy buddy me
yeah yeah I like walk up to your glass
and they're just like it hit it it's
like whoa okay I don't want that to
happen out what to like put my cup down
while I'm talking someone have 10 people
come by and like rub their cups against
year hmm I don't know but then I could
also see the application where if you
guys out hanging out and you genuinely
meet someone that's pretty cool it's
really easy to just be like a book but
then if you have smartphones with NFC go
bunk I don't know I don't really see the
awesome appeal it's kind of cool and his
it's like it's kind of it's interesting
as one of those like oh cool application
of technology i didn't believe it and
like if you went to a some event and
they had it there it would probably be
really cool as a novelty as a novelty
thing or whatever so like I'm not
actually against it i just i personally
wouldn't be doing to it but then again
okay don't have facebook um so back to
google glass i personally based on the
battery life i think they were saying
something like what was it 30 minutes
when you're recording video or something
ludicrous like that i don't remember the
exact number but the battery life's not
there um i'm personally not even
remotely excited about it yet but gen 3
or gen 5 or jen 10 of this technology is
going to be just incredible and i'll
jump on the bandwagon when instead of
$1,500 i can buy it for a hundred and
fifty bucks and i don't have to be some
special dude with an invite and the
functionality will be dramatically
better by then I also had in one news
item was that Google's saying people are
apparently hack stirring the google
glass and they want to do whatever they
want but they're saying no no no we
meant to do that which like I don't know
how credible that is but yes but from
some people I could see them being like
oh oh no we meant to do that from google
though Google usually leaves things a
lot okay true that's my view of that is
they often do um now people are also
talking about how
there might be like remote shut off and
a whole bunch of other weird stuff I
don't know how true this is so don't
take this directly but apparently google
has like quite a bit of control over it
still so removing that might be
interesting if that's even real I don't
know I read that on the comments of a
thread this is an article from source
bed which is um oh oh hold on weeks I
opened it on the wrong thing I know I
know we're gonna we're going to go a
little bit over time today ah so we'll
we'll do this and then we'll be doing
our our weights of the week oh yeah this
was cool so this was interesting
speaking of Google and sort of all that
stuff this was on SourceFed it's who has
your back with respect to your privacy
so let's scroll down to the immediately
just to chart yep who has your back so
the requirements are requires a warrant
for content to share tells users about
government data requests publishes
transparency reports publishes a law
enforcement guidelines fights for users
privacy in courts and fights for users
privacy in Congress so there you go
amazon only got two stars out of six and
guys okay i'm not saying that this chart
is the be-all and end-all by any stretch
of the imagination this is source feds
chart and there you go but as a general
guideline it's kind of cool to look at
and it makes you really think about the
topic if nothing else Apple fights for
users privacy rights in Congress that's
it AT&amp;amp;T very low rating comcast very low
rating Dropbox look at that huge so
other than fighting for users privacy
rights in courts they're requiring
warrants they're doing all the things by
the blog Facebook only got three stars
so no transparency reports they don't
tell you about a government data
requests for square is a touch better
than that Google scores very well so
this is why where I was going with that
LinkedIn very well the only thing they
don't do is fight for it in court much
like Dropbox Microsoft not bad somewhere
in the middle ground here so the things
that they don't do is fight in court and
tell users about government data
requests myspace it's like if you needed
a reason to not be on myspace anymore
there you go so there's the rest of them
twitter is across the board sonic.net
across the board um verizon yeah not
looking too good yahoo not looking too
good so i just thought this was a really
cool article i wanted to make sure you

outside where he's cutting the mid plate

always an option if we screw things up
I'll tweet 0 2 links for it yeah
Dominator Platinum's there we go yeah
there we go there's the mid plate
cutting holes okay let's keep on going
very clean beautiful peripherals that
explains why i like a hundred people
tuned out of the live stream while we
were doing this cuz I thought it was a
crew ah sleeving great looking great
looking ikea desk there nice themed
build there we go beautiful absolutely
gorgeous sparkly to me Zack played on
the video card mentioned this before I
apologize for the part where I mentioned
it and you couldn't actually look at it
just oh just sexy sleeving matching
motherboard matching the gelid wing fans
look fantastic in there all these little
shots of the inside just look
outstanding and you look at the
shininess of this it's so awesome white
LEDs using the built-in like a switch
810 which is a really nice thing to have
and there we go now on to the second
bill blog there we are all right sister
scroll down I'm gonna tweet out that
link for the build log another switch
there you go but very different bill
whoo like very different why hello there
t-virus in the back which is just
absolutely awesome c virus is amazing
everyone should have a tea virus I'm
like the positions very cool and when
you see his desk set up it even makes a
lot more sense as to why he put it where
it is so this build is very attainable I
mean this is something where no custom
fabrications been done yo and CP 655
pump you know nice nice water cooling
and all that
this is doable yep nice pictures yeah
they got better here yeah they get
better pretty quick kingston hyperx
memory looks good looking good
sabertooth boards make for such a
clean-looking don't look so awesome yeah
I've seen the upcoming sabertooth yeah
yeah can't say anything about it though
alright some more night shots looking
good ok I'm letting you do commentary on
these so so I was tweeting out that
thing yeah here you can see sus there
you're at his desk you can see the
t-virus yeah instead of it being covered
up by the side panel because the window
is obviously not that big no it's not
small on the switch 810 yeah so by
putting it in the back you can actually
the only has t-virus all the time so
that's very cool cuz most people will go
oh just to the right of the motherboard
bam there's my wrist bone that's where
mine is that's that's where mine is but
I can see mine yeah I could see mine too
I think Linda but just because of how he
has his desk set up half his computer
can hang off the edge which is gonna
sketchy but um where he's sitting he can
actually see his t bars right which is
very cool very understandable so that's
a like awesome obtainable level build
the one before that was more like that
ridiculous though ridiculously awesome
level not quite as obtainable okay guys
