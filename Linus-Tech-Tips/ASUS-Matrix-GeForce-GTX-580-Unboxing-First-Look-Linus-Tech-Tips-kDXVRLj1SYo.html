Platinum Republicans gamers graphics
card it comes in a huge box and it is a
very special video card so uses the GTX
580 GPU it has 1.5 gigs of memory it is
clocked pretty high and stuff it's got a
memory interface it's got maximum
digital resolution of 2560 by 1600 ok
it has DisplayPort out which is kind of
cool and a minimum of 700 watt system
power supplies are recommended for the
use of this card and you will see why
once I get it opened up because it's all
big and impressive and consumes lots of
power but it consumes lots of power
because it's powerful so it is designed
for overclocking enthusiasts following
the success of the extreme tweet Tweaker
features had a soos ice created the new
tweak it to give users flexible
overclocking control even when running
benchmark program so yes you can add
just the frequency of this card with
onboard buttons pretty crazy am i right
real-time hardware loading monitoring
with the LEDs over here so blue is light
loading green is safe mode pink is heavy
loading blue is medium loading and red
is extreme loading so that actually
doesn't seem to be here maybe that's
somewhere else I guess well we'll check
that out we'll check that out ok GPU
tweak is there utility for overclocking
it uses direct cu2 technology for the
cooler and it has 19 phase super allen
19 phases ok it has 19 phase super alloy
power for the PWM on this card let's go
ahead and get it opened up Wow we've
actually got an accessory box as well as
a box with compartments um so because
this is a GTX 580 card what that means
is we do have support for all of your
videos technologies including 3d vision
3d vision surround if you run an SLI we
do all
we have support for sli up to three way
or even four way if you have a
motherboard
that supports it you've got support for
cuda physx all of that good stuff this
is a great sticker check out this
sticker it's all shiny and red and black
looks outstanding GTX 580 driver and
menu will get rid of it download the
latest off the Nvidia website you can
just download a regular GTX 580 driver
there's no need for a special driver
here's a quick set-up guide we've also
got a couple of dual six pin to eight
pin PCIe power adapters and we've got an
SLI bridge included hey that's
thoughtful okay it's a longer SLI bridge
we've got a DVI to VGA adapter although
honestly guys if you're using a VGA
monitor with my graphics card of this
caliber and I would recommend a monitor
upgrade instead of buying a graphics
card of this caliber oh man this thing's
for donkey let's look at this oh so
that's where your real-time loading
indicator is and that's that's a cool
feature so it actually glows a different
color depending on how much load the
graphics card is under very cool yeah
sure let's start with the power
connector so we have dual eight pin PCIe
power connectors that are required to
power this board we've also got a full
cover back plate on the back of the
board actually here now check that out
that looks really sharp so you can see
that it's actually I can't tell if it's
making contact with anything over there
looks like it's not okay so this is
mostly for looks in all likelihood but
it's got ventilation holes here it's and
it looks really sharp so this text is
going to be right side up when it is
installed in your case so you'll be able
to read a soos matrix GTX 580 just fine
okay here we've got our two sli
connectors so that means that we do have
support for multi Way SLI configurations
not just two graphics cards this is a
standard PCIe to 16x interface so this
is not an SLI on a card it doesn't
require any kind of special connector
the only thing you really have to worry
about is the power so like I said -
eight pins
alright on the back oh this is
interesting it's got a safe mode button
I guess that's for safe mode okay we
have DisplayPort HDMI
dual DVI outputs that are covered by
little blue covers by default and they
are capable of VGA as well everything is
very helpfully labeled not only on the
card itself but also on the plastic
piece here I don't know if you can read
that but it says DVI ok and it's gonna
be hard for us to take a good look at
the custom PCB that went into this but
um when we look at the custom cooler
first so we have dual 90 millimeter pwm
fans here so these are full thickness
fans these are not your slim fans that
you typically see on these dual card our
dual dual fan coolers so they're gonna
have some real static pressure behind
them those are big fat heat pipes in
there too I want you to kind of try and
see down there can you see the heat
pipes yeah there we go so those are
really fat heat pipes let me see how
many are going to each side of the
cooler so it looks like we've got a
total of one two three four five yeah it
looks like correct me if I'm wrong here
guys but it looks like we've got five
heat pipes two of which are going to
this side yeah you can see the heat
pipes running through here one weight
our third one's going out the other side
no yeah okay yeah you can see the
termination so there's two coming out of
here
remember this side also has direct heat
transfer as well because the GPU itself
is right down there okay and then this
one has three heat pipes going through
it so that's carrying heat away from the
GPU and then out to this side where it
will be taken away by this fan now this
fan also blows down directly onto this
heatsink that is going to be cooling the
PWM it looks like the RAM chips do not
have heat sinks on them but they're
going to be actively cooled by this fan
which can actually be better for RAM
chips in some scenarios now this is a
fully custom PCB as I mentioned before
so let's start showing you some of those
features obviously this beefy PWM
heatsink is covering a beefy PWM which
is completely custom for this card you
don't have to worry about it blowing up
pretty much no matter how much voltage
or how much cooling and then how much
more voltage you throw at it so
hopefully you can see down there
reasonably well okay next we have the
buttons here so you can turn your fan to
100% let the push of a button that's
kind of a cool feature because if you're
like okay I'm gonna you know benchmark
boom just turn your fan on all the way
then you don't have to worry about it
ramping up hotter and then catching
itself to bring itself back down so you
can keep it as cool as possible you can
turn the speeds up and down you've got
this little indicator set of LEDs here
and then finally you've got aha voltage
check points so for GPU memory volt
three 3v3 twelve volt and ground you
have all of those on there let's see how
these fans are hooked up by it okay so
this must be to do with this and it
looks like the fans are hooked up
through this custom connector right here
yeah that would be my that would be my
guess so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the GTX 580 matrix don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech tips
from on boxing's reviews and other
computer videos and oh yeah last thing
this is a triple slot card so if you are
going to try to run two of these in sli
make sure you have a card that has very
very wide spacing for the PCIe 16x slot
so the really one of these cards should
be providing most of the power you would
need for a lot of the games out there
these days oh look at this I've never
seen anything this crazy before okay
they've actually got labeled solder
points for you to do volt mods on this
thing you got to be kidding me so you
can disable the OCP that is the
overcurrent protection I'm not sure what
these other markings being power PWM you
can change the PWM frequency so you can
put a variable resistor on there and
change that sup no way you can't build
that into a video card that's crazy so
this thing is designed from the ground
up for subzero that is amazing actually
cool okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
