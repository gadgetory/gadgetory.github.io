can see it's seen better days the actual
problem with it is something to do with
the the power delivery inside it's
causing the via a C adapter to short out
and long story short the shell is pretty
much useless at this point so it was
either throw it away
or find a more creative solution now it
just happens NCIX just brought in a
whole bunch of these OCZ DIY notebooks
so this one is the Avenger a g2 and it
happens to be about the same age
here I'll flip this upside down so you
can actually read it it happens to be
about the same age as the laptop that
I'm trying to fix so what I figured I do
is grab one of these at a good price and
then just transplant all of the parts
from the old laptop into the new shell
so we're gonna see how it goes and I'm
gonna just unbox the Avenger a g2 for
you today if I could get the tape to
break here we go so I actually got the
pink model partly because I like pink
and partly because it's for my sister
how much of which of those reasons is uh
how much each of them is actually
contributing to the purchase you'll
never know okay nope computer enjoying
with me this is very this is a very odd
package for an ocz like bare-bones
computer but I guess I can't really
complain here why don't we go over the
basic specs so you can see on the side
here this is model and 7tr - p it has a
modem okay
it has a four cell battery it has a DVD
writer okay it has oh these are optional
so optional a webcam bluetooth and
antenna so I know that this one does
have bluetooth but I don't think it
comes with a wireless card so I guess
that means it just comes with an antenna
very strange okay so it has a 12.1 inch
chip screen and it has let's see it knee
okay it requires CPU harddrive and RAM
so that's what I'm going to pull out of
the old laptop
camera man's phone's going off it's
turning it off that's very polite of him
usually it's my phone that goes off in
the middle of our filming sessions but
no no cameraman pull the Lynas today all
right so let's have a look at the bow
hey this is pretty nice so the package
here this is an OCC DIY notebook so they
include everything you need to do it
yourself okay so you've got your your
notebook power cord your AC power
adapter you've got um what's in here so
you got a little microfiber cloth for
cleaning off the screen or what-have-you
and then um looks like uh looks like an
isolator for the bottom of the harddrive
to make sure that it doesn't short out
on anything
I'm guessing okay you got some thermal
compound very nice very nice and you got
a couple screws Oh hard drive screws
here you go so it takes standard two and
a half inch our guys modem cable I'm
sure you've seen one of those before
alright you know like a phone cable okay
then in here we've got some more stuff
you've got a the cheesiest looking
driver CD I've seen in quite a while so
for Windows Vista I'm hoping this
thing's gonna run Windows seven for her
but if not I can always throw this on it
alright
sometimes Vista drivers will work with
seven oh well whatever I've given away
the CD key now power DVD is included
Nero is seven essentials are also
included and then yeah there's the
driver CD concisely hello men concise
users guide look at this thing concise
Wow
so I'm guessing there's a lot more in
here than you would typically find in a
user's guide like I my guess is that
it's going to include instructions on
how to actually put this thing together
and so far I actually I don't see that
happening here no no instructions on how
to put it together they really take this
DIY thing seriously so let's show you
how to install a wireless card but other
than that nothing about the CPU or the
RAM or anything okay well that's fine I
can render that then we've got the this
is a four cell battery alright and then
we find a little heat pipe cooler module
so I'm going to assume that's for the
CPU and that there's going
some kind of a fan that blows over that
so why don't we put this aside for now
and then I'll get the actual notebook
out here now I realize this is a bit of
a downgrade for where my sister versus
the one that she was using before us a
15 inch Bowl their goal this cruise good
thing I'm not trying to put this back
together whoops okay
I'll just put that there it had like an
8600 GT mobile GPU in it now I have no
use for that whatsoever okay let's call
it the notebook moving on here it is
that is like that is pink that is as
pink as I've seen in a while for a pink
notebook all right let's get the tape
off here that's some pretty solid tape
all right Wow even through the blue
plastic that is like the biggest
notebook I've ever seen oh wow this is
really hard to open see I really should
just have a knife on my keychain if
anyone wants to get me like a Christmas
present I need an a knife for my
teaching all right
Wow so let's take off the plastic oh
actually why don't I leave it on because
to prevent damage to the high gloss
style finish top cover follow these
guidelines
okay remove the protective khlestakov
remove the protective color slowly and
carefully do not forcibly tear off the
protective cover as this may damage the
surface
do not use pointed object oh okay I
think I have to actually open up the
notebook first to take off the tabs on
the other side aha yes there they are
mmm this is actually kind of nice
looking so this is probably going to
take me like a minute or two and I'm I
apologize for that but I've got to take
off all of these uh
all these little TP things in order to
actually get at the notebook itself and
I'm obviously not going to be able to
turn it on because I still have to build
this thing but we'll still be able to
have a look at the at the notebook and
have a look at the keyboard and you know
what what the overall fit and finish of
it looks like which could be very
helpful for anyone who wants to grab one
of these because they're available in
five different colors I think there's a
yellow white blue black and the pink one
that we have here all right still
working on this oh I did it again I've
had a couple people complain about my
little habit of coming to myself while I
unbox things but it is hard to resist
I'll have you know all right there we go
we finally got it sort of uh non-law CD
package finish this thing is a pink okay
so let's have a look at what we've got
in terms of i/o on this side we've got a
Kensington lock a modem one USB port
we've got our DVD Drive then around the
front we've got our headphones
microphone and spit if wow that's kind
of random then we have an SD card as
well as our indicator lights for
wireless battery and whatever else that
is then we have two more USB ports on
this side a firewire port VGA out this
is a bit of an older model so no HD HDMI
or DVI then we have gigabit as well as
power in and around the back we find
where the battery plugs in so I'm going
to have to take this whole thing apart
and install all the hardware inside it
but yeah until then all we can really do
is have a look at the keyboard keyboard
layout is actually very nice this is a
little bit high so it's some hitting the
space bar isn't the easiest thing in the
world but with my sort of smallish hands
I can very comfortably reach all of the
keys on this keyboard they haven't done
anything stupid like like an abominably
short shift key or anything like that
you've bought a proper two space
backspace key all of your function keys
are things that sort of make sense
brightness up brightness down volume up
volume down
all that kind of stuff the fit and
finish of it actually overall seems very
nice there's not a whole lot of flex to
the shell itself I mean there's a little
bit but once you put the battery in
there it's going to be pretty darn good
um that pretty much does it it's a wide
screen LCD and there is the webcam that
the cameraman is so kindly showing to us
and thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the OCZ Avenger a g-tube
bones DIY notebook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
