the enthu pro ii case from fantex the
jazz mini phone and tablet stand from
Coolermaster is now available in a
variety of cool colors from these great
retailers click now to learn more
honestly
we got off to a bit of a rough start
with the enthu pro the foam packing
material in the box arrived broken and
it is some of the worst that I've ever
seen my case wasn't damaged but if
you're ordering a system from somewhere
I wouldn't even consider getting it
pre-built in the enthu Pro with the
extra weight of the other components
there's a very good chance that will
arrive damaged packaging is important
and fantex is an attention to it reveals
their inexperience as a case
manufacturer which leads us to the case
itself the inexperience doesn't show
here at all the enthu Pro has a look
about it that somehow manages to be
subtle and elegant and yet screen
performance this is of course very
subjective but I think the case looks
fantastic the brushed finish looks metal
from many angles even though it's
thankfully easy to clean plastic and it
just is really really nice and I don't
know what it is exactly but the case is
somehow subtle and elegant but also
aggressive and imposing and even though
it's a mid Tower it just looks more
impressive than its size would normally
allow I feel like we're kindred spirits
that way let's move on to the features
though the front has three five and a
quarter inch base with a fourth spot
that appears to be one but is actually
the cover for the fairly standard front
i/o further down we've got the included
200 millimeter front fan with options
for dual 120 or 140 millimeter mounts
covered by a classy looking mesh with
diagonal slits on each side to help the
front fans draw an additional air one
quirk I noticed here is that while the
mesh is filtered the side intakes are
not so you can expect some dust to get
into the case here
speaking of dust filters though you get
lots of them aside from the one in the
front there are two on the bottom a
short one at the back for the power
supply intake and a long one at the
front for the two optional bottom
mounted fans or radiator mount there and
then a large one built into the
classically styled
all behind the power button removing the
top reveals the meat and potatoes of the
radiator mounting options you can put up
to a triple 120 or triple 140 up here to
go along with the other available
radiator mounting points that can be
accessed by removing various internal
pieces and because the rear fan uses
mounting slots instead of holes you can
make room to put your Barb's in the rear
to salvage more of your five and a
quarter inch base so you can put I don't
know things that are more useful than
optical drives there praise be to gay
men for creating steam anyway finishing
up our external tour the rear features 8
PCI expansion slots and a tube reservoir
mount for the liquid cooling folks and
the sides feature well nothing on the
right and an unusual dual window design
on the left that I find quite attractive
I do have an issue with the window
though this case is brand new and has
only been built in once and we've been
as careful with it as we can be but the
quality of the acrylic here is so poor
that it basically looks like it belongs
to a two-year-old case yeah
now the astute among you may have
noticed that a while ago I said that you
can remove some stuff to make more room
for radiators well you can also remove
either of the Triple DES hard drive /
SSD cages if you want but that's not all
you can do the enthu pros internals are
held together primarily with screws
rather than rivets so for example let's
take a couple of the other great
features of this case like the stealth
cover over the drive bays or the stealth
cover with cable management over the
power supply pull out a few screws and
all that biz comes right out this design
approach is more expensive but gives
owners who want to mod or paint their
towers a ton of flexibility big props to
fantex they're finishing up the
motherboard side of the internals well I
mean wow there's not much to say the
cable management holes are mostly filled
with grommets and intelligently
positioned for things like the front
panel audio connector 24 pin connector
and even common fan header locations and
there's ample space between the radiator
and the motherboard to access connectors
like the 8 pin even after the rad is
installed it's surprisingly easy to work
in for a mid Tower on the back side
there's actually more to talk about
there's the reasonably well-constructed
wing locking three and a half inch drive
rail system
is the large CPU cut out for easy cooler
installation there's the ample cable
management room at the bottom for
stashing stuff there's the well-placed
and numerous included velcro cable
management straps all over the back
there's the SSD bracket mountable here
or here that maintains adequate spacing
to not strain your connectors and has
screw holes but we found actually works
just fine as a friction mount and
finally there's the six channel fan
controller that runs up to the CPU fan
header on your board and can be used to
power up to six fans just make sure to
consult the manual for instructions on
when to use the SATA power connector
versus when to not use it actually the
surprisingly well-written manual is part
of an excellent overall accessory
package that also includes an optional
reservoir mount that can screw onto the
hard drive cages some more cable
management stuff and there are awesome
little toolbox that holds all the screws
you need for your case in handy little
compartments and with that I think we're
done here
so what can I say is a conclusion for
the NP pro I mean I guess I could give
it like an award or something but we
don't really do that so instead I'm
going to say this fantex
it's time to update your website son
because y'all make CPU cooler spins and
cases now welcome to the big league any
gamer or enthusiast with $100 budget for
a new case should basically pick up an
end through pro and I'd go as far as to
say that even if your budget is closer
to 129 to 149 you should still take a
long hard look at it it's not perfect
but it's really really good and I'm
excited to see what they do next guys
