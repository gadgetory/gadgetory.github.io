limited edition t-shirt and in-game
items for planetside 2 click now to
learn more so finally personal rig
update time it's actually been done for
kind of a while so I have my glass
window on there you can actually even
tell in video hi slick you can actually
even tell in video how much clearer that
makes the side panel window so I'm doing
a couple small upgrades number one and
the people ask me why I use such a
ghetto water cooling setup with curved
tubes and you know like it's not it's
not the nicest looking water cooling in
the world the reason is because I do
things like this I'm going to swap a
motherboard without actually changing
any of my tubing and without making my
life more difficult than it has to be
mine is upgradable which if you have a
really really tight runs and you have
like you know perfect you know curved
fittings and then straight tubing runs
or whatever else you can't really you
don't really have that same flexibility
so I'm also upgrading my graphics card
so I'm going to be going from the GTX
590 that's in there to this GTX Titan
and that is for one reason and one
reason only because 590 is still a
beastly card great performance but the
thing that's missing is support for
streaming to Nvidia shield which is
something that I want to be able to do
so we can go ahead and pull the side
panel off oh yeah these are something
that I actually added since the last
update so these are just little
decorative Hey focus he's a junkie yeah
there we go little decorative knobs
they don't actually hold anything on the
glasses held on by an
industrial-strength adhesive in here so
yeah those don't do anything they just
are for looks and they're like the
cheapest possible thing that I could
find at Home Depot that didn't look
absolutely terrible so there's a there's
a look at the insides so I've got
Crucial Ballistix tracer tactical
whatever the with the LEDs memory
there's that gold CPU block so
boss and then there's the graphics card
that I'll be pulling out alright so I
rope slick into holding the camera for
me for a minute here so I'm just on the
last screw to pull out the motherboard
here so I just got to find somewhere to
hold it by I'm gonna go with this
heatsink there we go
and this my friends is why I do things
the way I do them because I can extract
my motherboard just like this and
probably what I've been doing this maybe
what six seven minutes maybe yeah then
you got all those cards out to when I
got all the cards out so I can extract
another board just like that that's not
a curly blue and that reveals the
offshoot okay there's one thing I missed
let's say the cable yeah come on a
 SATA cables love that alright so
we can go ahead and put that down okay
now this is where things are going to
get a little bit tricky because I got a
drain this graphics card in order to
swap in this graphics card and that's
one thing I haven't looked back closely
at is how well the barbed positions are
going to line up between these two cards
because I don't want to redo my tubing
if I can get away with it
so let's just kind of try to try to
visually line these up then can I go
that's pretty good yeah yeah that's
going to be okay
so we're going to use this bucket right
here as a drain bucket we're just going
to pop one of the fittings off of the
graphics card again and do it and then
just drain into here I don't have to
fully drain the loop which is great
because I just have to drain the part
that I need to swap in the new graphics
card put that in and then it means that
it's going to be much quicker to bleed
bleed the air out of when we're done in
fact I may not even need to top up the
reservoir in order to get it back up and
running so this is extremely unorthodox
I don't really recommend doing this but
what I'm doing right now is I'm
loosening one of the plugs here and
we're just going to drain just the card
and anything that would sit above it
while we swap it out for a different one
now they know the funny funny
conversation slick and I just had about
GTX 590 he's all
like hey I'll take that card off your
hands I'm all like hey are you sure and
he's like yeah sure and I'm like no
shadow plays I got that GTX 590 is
probably the best card that just makes
absolutely no sense right now from a
features perspective performance wise if
you're not planning to stream to a
shield or use shadowplay so a game
streaming on Twitch or anything like
that man is such a beast I've actually
kind of forgotten I was looking it up
the other night this thing owns the 680
I'd completely forgotten about that it
just stomps all over it in terms of
actual FPS performance so still a good
card just kind of move over to something
else I mean Shrive PS I don't think
Titan is going to be that much faster it
might not even be at all and having the
bigger frame buffer will help them
because GTX 590 is going to be held back
by each of the GPUs having only one and
a half gigs so if you wanted to go
higher than two and a half K probably or
even higher than 1080p and some of the
more modern titles then that might hold
you back a little bit I think that was
pretty much all the water we're getting
it out of it
only oh pretty payments might be
speaking too soon here then never know
I've been known to do that from time to
time oh this is gonna be tricky here's
something to watch out for guys so if
you're ever trying to do I get a water
cooling loop upgrade like this watch out
for this so when I disconnect this I'm
going to have to secure it above the
u-bend down here somehow because
otherwise all the water from that
reservoir will come dumping out of it
and that'll be a problem so I'm just
going to watch out for that so the crazy
Russian gave me this a little while ago
and I had kind of a nostalgia moment
just for lols I mean remember guys
between the best decent thermal compound
on the market and the worst decent
thermal compound on the market we're
talking a few degrees
so just for lols I'm going to be using
ocz Ultra 5 plus thermal paste on my 39
70 X and I've decided to change the
order of operations a little bit here so
I was going to do the video card swap
first but instead I think I'm going to
put the motherboard in first because
that'll allow me that will give me
where to put the video card once I'm
done so that it doesn't just kind of
flop all over the place so I'm going to
get that put in right now this is a
relatively small upgrade but I'm
actually ditching the killer Nick it's
just causing driver issues again even
though it has a really cool red LED on
it and stuff and I'm throwing in and
until server Nick so I'm going to go go
that route instead it's a bit of an
older one but it supports everything
that I need it to support and at least
take some of the processing load off of
the CPU not that it doesn't have plenty
to spare but you know every little bit
counts right
putting the raid card back in for those
of you who haven't seen it before that's
running to eight Corsair SSDs that are
running in raid 0 giving you a total of
around 900 gigs of SSD based storage mmm
how this always happens but like my
build blog videos always end up with
things I don't recommend in them like
jamming a pen in a piece of tubing to
keep it from spraying water all over the
place I used to have proper tubing plugs
that I used to use for this stuff but I
don't really have them anymore then like
twist tying the block up here so that
this doesn't drain into the rest of the
system anyway here's the new graphics
card that's going to be going in and
yeah GTX Titan coolants block looks
absolutely beautiful here we go so as
you may or may not have noticed the
computer is now upside down we have a
bit of a problem
I dropped my backplate behind the
motherboard so I got a go home see my
family and stuff so we're going to call
that it for for today but it's like I
flipped it upside down and I did manage
to get it to come back so that's good
news I don't have to pull the
motherboard out other good news is the
graphics card is now installed the
fittings are on and we're going to be
pretty much ready to rock as soon as I
get that CPU block mounted and get these
expansion cards put in very very excited
alright so I cut it sorted out a fair
bit of picking away at the back I also
had to completely destroy what little I
had done in terms of cable management
back here in order to access the back
plates
so that's going to be a bit of a mess to
fix now but the expansion cards are all
in there we go
well that one needs to be cleaned zone
ours ends from a soos with that
Sennheiser co-branding on it there we go
maybe that's a little bit better now ah
that gleam there we go alright so
there's the LSI 9268 I where's my Intel
whatever it is that Gigabit Ethernet
card as well as sound card and graphics
cards the last thing left here is - oh
this is something I did not think of oh
I don't need one of the two pins anymore
so this extra two pins I do not need
that's fascinating
I'll have to figure out somewhere to
hide those good thing I still have that
other side panel off and I haven't done
anything with the wires alright so there
she is with the board swap done get a
bit of a better angle what I love about
this board is it has tons of PCI Express
expansion so you can still add like
another PCIe 16x card potentially
something else down here if I was
willing to move this down a little bit I
wanted to give it a bit more room to
breathe and it had before though so yeah
I can still put a couple more PCIe 8 X
cards in here which is pretty darn
impressive so now I just gotta fix
things up at the back a little bit close
it up and then we're good to go sure do
so the ultimate first world problem is
like having too many SSDs piled up
behind your motherboard tray so you
can't close your chassis anymore see
that they actually stick out quite a bit
from here you got to get a mushroom down
flat there so what I have to do with my
system is basically lay it down on its
side this is why I don't like taking up
this side panel you can see there's
quite a bulge here and I just got a
and it's quite a tight fit now that I
had it painted because it changes the
tolerances a little bit fitting together
oh then I got slider shot like that in
order to contain everything but other
than that oh whoa
now you did a now she's done and that is
what the inside is in theory supposed to
look like that's a little bit gimpy
right there say the cable I guess that's
not too bad I feel bad it was like backs
of the cards are dusty and stuff but
it's not exactly a new build in the same
way that it was new when I put it
together like months ago so how to take
it home and fire it up and get some
shield streaming gaming going on here
alright friends this is the moment where
we find out if she boots off Bob boots
up or powers on and boots on all right
let's see how that water levels doing in
the res Oh looks like she's not bleeding
perfectly okay so let's oh looks like it
decided to take another crack at things
itself that's interesting okay
come on pump
come on postcode keep doing things whoa
that's a good sign all right so she
boots but I don't see anything that
looks like particularly good water flow
in there so we're going to shut her down
see if we can let some of that the air
bubbles that are stuck in the pump bleed
out all right so I'll be back when we
try this again and that my friends is
why I always recommend a variable speed
pump and not cheeping out in getting the
B version of the d5 because I'm able to
tweak the speed in order to just jar
loose the bubble so I'm able to get
things running so looks like I didn't
even lose enough fluid during the refill
to completely drain my res so all I got
to do is top this baby up and we're
pretty much ready to rock I hope she
boots up I guess bull might as well find
out together right I think that's the
whole point of this vlogging thing well
that doesn't look like an F Drive so
there they are
okay good normally it's something one on
the second page so I guess this board
does it differently for some reason that
freaked me out a little so you can see
my raid zero has been found nine hundred
gigabytes okay please boot up please
moved up hmm oh it might not be set to
the correct order well okay well the
rams detective that's good because
officially on paper this Ram is not
compatible f1 tender set up yeah
spare you guys the suspense and there
she goes booting up into Windows with
the fresh changes to the hardware it
looks like we are good so thank you for
checking out build blog number I guess
this is part 16 of the personal rig
update that I guess is finally sort of
done I still want to do kind of a you
know like a glam video showcase of the
rig or something but I'm not quite done
with my setup yet because as you can see
I'm still running an older monitor this
is an
like an ancient BenQ 1920 by 600 thing
I've got a new monitor that I've had on
order for a while I've got people asking
me also for a little while here what i
use for peripherals so this is my
replacement of khari lasers my third one
now so that I mean I guess I use it a
lot but you know they I guess they die
but I can't get used to anything else
I've tried this is a me on accessible 60
is cherry MX blacks which are not
generally my favorite switches but I
like this particular keyboard these are
my steel series 7hs that I use for when
I'm sitting here and when I don't have
something else to plug in to the essence
one external USB soundcard and DAC I use
coarser SP 2500 speakers and just to
show my my total non-biased miss I
balance out my Intel swag with AMD swag
and this is actually a ruby sword so he
he sits here with all that stuff if I
think is kind of funny it's my little
swag guy there's my star citizen citizen
card or whatever they're called and I
guess that's ah that's pretty much it
full tour proper tour and some glam of
the system coming when I get around to
it thanks guys for watching as always
