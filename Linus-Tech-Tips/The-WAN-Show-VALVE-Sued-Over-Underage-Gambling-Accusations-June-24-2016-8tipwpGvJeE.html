is that time again this week the time
that I set aside to spend with you all
of you out there in twitch twitch
streaming land and oh crap I've got the
tab open on my on my laptop and I'm like
20 seconds behind I can hear myself and
okay I've I've managed to make it so
that I'm not going crazy anymore which
is nice I am unfortunately without Luke
this week which is which is a real shame
but he's basically got some stuff he's
got a deal with this week and I totally
get it so I'm gonna hopefully have
someone join me in a short while here
and you know it's funny I was planning
to have the show go completely smoothly
with no hitches in his absence the way
that he claims that it always goes when
I'm not around but I will confess to you
now I have not yet actually tested my
screen share so this is the moment of
truth
will I be having uneasy
well not easy I mean you know
live-streaming is it's very difficult
very very difficult but will I be having
a seamless show today or no oh look at
that
nailed it yes my friend so we've got a
lot of great topics for you today
there's been some big news and there's
been some little news researchers built
a 1000 core processor I'll be talking
about that and why it probably doesn't
mean a whole lot to you and won't for
quite some time
YouTube's Terms of Service have been
updated it's mostly around their
harassment and cyberbullying policy so
that is gonna have potentially huge
ramifications for some youtubers out
there who are basically making a living
out of harassment and cyberbullying
twitch brings CFAA and trademark claim
against bots operators apparently they
are a persistent frustration that is
some strong language coming from there
senior vice president marketing okay and
in much huger news that's not
necessarily directly purely tech related
but will absolutely have an effect on
technology and how that how that works
especially for Europeans moving forward
the UK has voted to leave the EU it is
it is final but there are some important
other notes about it that we're going to
be talking a little bit about later so
without further ado let's get on twitch
chat here and see if see if wow no one
is complaining that is amazing
and here come all the complaints so
let's roll the intro so that I can just
you don't even have to watch me
pretending not to read them
we're face like four pixels off oh wait
also for some reason we have much darker
skin in this one fascinating title bear
fresh box and those are all the same but
the blank ones ah one of these days one
of these days we're gonna become a real
professional media company and we're not
gonna we're not gonna make little
mistakes like who am i kidding that's
never happening alright so let's jump
right into our first topic here the
original article here is from n gadget
researchers build a 1000 core processor
that they call Vikki liqueur yep that
makes sense
so in a nutshell what any what a kilo
core or a many many core processor would
be optimized for is as you can well
imagine performing many many parallel
operations so that's many many many many
small things all at once this is not
going to have pretty much any relevance
to you the person sitting there who
wants to play games or encode video that
you edited or I mean really most of what
you would consider to be a home use for
a computer this is not going to have any
relevance for you I don't want to say
ever because ever is a really big word
but for a very very long time because
the limitation of the way that we
currently code software is usually when
it comes to performance the single
threaded performance of the CPU or CPUs
that are being used to handle the
workload it will take an enormous change
in the way that programming is done for
something like this hyper low-power kilo
core processor to have much relevance to
someone who wants to even you know
general web browsing can consume a lot
of CPU horsepower these days but there
are things that it
can be used for sorting through data
encryption one of the applicability sort
of notes that I have in here is encoding
videos but that is heavily dependent on
the codec being used for one thing and
for well I mean how many video streams
you're trying to encode so if you could
make a thousand core processor that is
powerful enough for each of the course
to handle an individual encoding stream
holy crap I mean I could see a site like
twitch or like YouTube being all over
that kind of technology it's like you
mean we can have a thousand cores each
of which can handle an incoming video
encoding request from a file upload by
itself and these things can consume
let's see point seven Watts total I mean
the whole thing could run on a double-a
battery and this is without the benefit
of the latest manufacturing process node
so this was actually built on 32
nanometer technology which is quite
archaic at this point in time though it
should be noted that a mere what I don't
know four or five years ago that would
have been considered state-of-the-art so
the processor handles 115 billion
instructions per second and part of what
makes it operate so efficiently at the
core is that the course transfer data to
each other directly rather than on a
shared cache of memory they'll again it
should be noted that that will only be
more efficient for certain workloads
where the cores need to share data
directly with each other and where you
can build enough interconnects for the
cores to not have to leap over multiple
other cores in order to access another
one very very cool so let's just see if
there's a is there like a picture I can
show you or anything like that it looks
like most of the news articles this
one's over on BGR comm are just pulling
generic CPU pictures off of
shutterstock here ooh flight attendants
and passengers get away with this all
the time fascinating love it thank you
for that I love those sponsored articles
under the actual article that I'm trying
to read all right so the original source
here is Dex
err TOCOM a site that we've never
actually referred to before as far as
I'm aware just go ahead and make sure
that's positive so there have been some
changes to the YouTube Terms of Service
that target harassment now to be clear I
don't have a strong objection to
changing Terms of Service to prevent
cyber bullying or harassment and
honestly I don't know why we relieve and
call it cyber bullying bullying is
bullying and calling it a bullying it's
almost like or cyber bullying is almost
like softening it I mean what's actually
you know what would be considered more
adulterous sex or cyber sex you know
what do we consider to be more sport
like sports or eSports I don't
personally believe that cyber bullying
has the potential to be any less harmful
than any other type of bullying and in
fact I think it can make you feel much
more trap's because you can't even
escape from it online so anyway YouTube
has made some changes to the terms in
cases where harassment crosses the line
into a malicious attack it can be
reported and will be removed so this is
referring specifically to a video that a
user would upload so harassment may
include abusive videos comments and
messages revealing someone's personal
information which is great I mean daxing
is never okay maliciously recording
someone without their consent that's
interesting how do you determine that it
is malicious and I mean what does that
do for an awful lot of YouTube videos
that are just like oh it's birth and
fail look out stupid they are that's a
that's that's interesting that could
have serious ramifications for content
that it will be uploaded and a lot of
content that's already on the site
making hurtful and negative comments and
videos about another person deliberately
posting content in order to humiliate
someone unwanted sexual ization which
encompasses sexual harassment or
sexual bullying in any form and
incitement to harass other users or
creators interesting note is that what's
what's that channel called drama alert
yeah something yeah jeans duh yeah drama
alert got a new host
within minutes minutes of this
announcement hours of this announcement
hi Nick welcome to the show
hello everyone um that's partially due
to that and partially due to the fact
that he's just a really you know
remember hold on we're uploading this to
YouTube no personal attacks okay no
harasses allegedly not a very nice
person and a lot of people have been
posting videos essentially attacking him
so it's like a two-fold thing I think
with that but yes they did replace their
host
it's funny how funny how swords can have
two edges on them isn't it I mean it
cuts both ways as the kids say actually
I think we actually had somewhat dated
expression which kids yeah we're 70 year
old kids oh come on
I'm not 70 anyway you can report people
that are breaking the new and updated
Terms of Service using YouTube's
reporting tool speaking of which I
actually need to deal with a false flag
on one of our stupid videos yeah every
every it's basically it's like just you
know no this isn't valid especially once
you're once you're a verified verified
youtuber it's it's pretty simple to deal
with a lot of those types of reports but
every once in a while someone will say
that our video needs closed captioning
which though would be nice yeah yeah but
we've looked into it before it's just
really expensive no they're saying it
needs it some videos legally must have
closed captioning if they've been
uploaded as broadcast television in the
United States then they they must be
closed captioned so for us it's just a
matter of going no actually it doesn't
I think also in Canada it's supposed to
be used just like a public resource yeah
so and I think it has to have closed
captioning as well so there's there's
some there's some Terms of Service Eid
any stuff that you know every once in a
while happens but this is this is pretty
potentially pretty far-reaching I mean
fortunately it doesn't have an impact on
us but what it does do is it highlights
for us and I mean really for any online
content creator once again the
powerlessness that we have I mean on the
one hand you think yeah you know
internet video you know kind of freedom
of expression so whatever say whatever
you want but at the end of the day what
people have to realize is that
youtube.com is Google's playground and
if you want to play in Google's
playground you got to play by Google's
rules and while this again doesn't
affect us because we don't harass or
bully people on the Linus tech tips
channel because a well okay there are
certain manufacturers that you could
argue that I wasn't very nice to their
product but that's not personal that's
the product but these terms are pretty
open-ended yep and that's like my huge
concern with it it is what are they
going to constitute as bullying are they
gonna constitute satire is bullying yeah
because that's a massive concern and I
think that you know I'm not like someone
who's at the beginning of the end for
YouTube or anything but yeah it brings
up a lot of concerning questions and
censorship is often the lead to the
death of a platform so I think that as
long as YouTube has the resources in
place to actually handle this properly
and they're just going to make sure that
they review everything before they do it
unlike their copyright system they don't
have a great history of doing this as
long as they handle it properly I think
it's a good thing for the platform
because let's be honest lately there has
been a lot of questionable content on
the platform but it has a huge potential
to go bad with that said they are making
strides towards improving these things
for example it used to be that if
someone filed a copyright claim against
you your monetization got pulled even
though the video might stay up during
the appeal period but your monetization
got pulled so
example monetization would go to the
person who is claiming it right I don't
think so in some situations I think if
it was like some new auto-detection of
music yes
but depending on what it was sometimes
Manas and I've had monetization just
pulled for other reasons okay during a
dispute or an appeal period for example
this is this is actually a great example
it's an older one now but I'm just gonna
I'm gonna pull up the video because this
was I was so freaking mad about this at
the time obviously it's water under the
bridge at this point I love my youtube
overlords um we love you please don't
shut us yeah please don't please don't
shut down my channel but check this out
so this is one of my older videos this
is back from 2012 and I have no idea how
loud this is for you guys but this is my
unboxing of the original razor blade so
let's go ahead and fullscreen this baby
yeah check that out it was a big old
thing it had like this weird weird this
was called the switchblade interface so
razor blade thin and light gaming
notebook featuring and you guys can't
read all the way over here because we
were covering it featuring switchblade
unboxing so what happened with this
video was that YouTube actually flagged
it automatically for dangerous content
containing weapons so I'm gonna pull up
ah I'm yeah yeah so I'm gonna pull up
the the analytics for this video and
I'll I'll explain exactly why I was so
upset about it so the way that my
compensation structure worked at NCIX at
the time was i had a monthly quota for
how many videos i had to make so i think
it was as high as 45 at one time 45
unboxings was like my quota and I got a
flat rate and it was it was very little
it was like $10 per unboxing or
something like that like it was it was a
pretty low rate or like $15 or something
but remember the production values
weren't what they
are now it was like it was one shot me
in my Y era okay sometimes there were
two shots if you made a mistake
sometimes there weren't two shots if I
made a mistake so let's be careful with
how we say the two shots ended up in the
video back in the day if - made a
mistake sometimes it was the person
behind the camera waving frantically
going stop stop stop
and then the shot would cut and then
you'd come back and go okay actually
yeah I was wrong it's actually this and
they would just leave that in the video
so for all you new viewers out there if
you think it's bad now check um so let's
go let's pull up my analytics for this
video here and and I will show you guys
why I was so upset because so I got a
flat rate for the videos that I made and
then what I also got was a cut of the
YouTube Adsense so that was how we ended
up with ads on the videos so here are
the first I don't know however many days
this is like 20 20 days some odd of this
video it got pulled immediately because
of the word switchblade and in the first
five days for me in 2012 okay like 70 80
thousand views like how many views is
this about 80 to 90 thousand views in
the first week was unheard of that was a
big deal that was like huge for me
also the CPMs I believe were higher on
the platform at the time and in a
variety of other reasons why this was
really upsetting but I just got pulled
it just got completely pulled I got
nothing for it and even though like my
appeal was like yo this is clearly a
laptop computer and nothing to do with
razors nothing to do with blades and
nothing to do with switchblade knives
hey put this back but they would just
turn them on a decision off and it's
just gone so the point of that really
long story was they're improving they're
getting better but it's not perfect yet
and
and I totally totally hope that they
don't screw this up all right speaking
of screwing things up the original
article here is from polygon and I'll
let I'll let Nick go ahead and introduce
this topic here and read this one you
haven't read this one okay this is a
Colton that's cool so last Friday twitch
filed a lawsuit against seven individual
slash organizations that are in business
of selling BOTS these bots are designed
to artificially inflate the viewer and
follower counts of twitch streamers they
are a persistent frustration in the
words of their marketing senior vice
president Matthew D Pietro and they have
announced that they are now creating a
very real problem on the platform so
these bots have been used to deny deny
streamers partnerships or harass other
broadcasters and twitch employees
technical technological solutions that
detect and remove false viewer are BOTS
currently so the lawsuit represents a
third layer in their strategy against
bots here and yeah among the allegations
there are federal trademark infringement
unfair competition cybersquatting fraud
breach of contract and tortillas
interference so they're seeking
injunctions against the bot makers
including the transfer of the possession
of their domains they're ordering
barring payment processors from
providing them with service and
restitution legal fees and punitive
damages I mean bots are a huge problem
for pretty much any platform that is
trying to monetize views or ad
impressions because I mean there are
there's a reason that I don't know if
you know this button the the Google
Adsense Terms of Service basically do
not care why bot traffic is viewing ads
on your site so this is like a really
scary thing this is not actually why we
lost our Google our Google Adsense
account that had to do with people
posting racy images on the forum the
under pictures lewd pictures on the
forum that like buried in a thread of
you know for almost like a 400 page
desktop wallpaper thread and it's like
you know you need to be moderate like
yeah yeah it is what it is so that's
that's why you don't see Google ads on
the line of tech tips for them anymore
but but this is an interesting
interesting fact is that their Terms of
Service
don't give a crap why there are BOTS
viewing them or why there are BOTS
clicking on the ads they are going to go
after you with a shoot first ask
questions later approach you'll get cut
off and you will it will be up to you to
prove that someone else was maliciously
coding BOTS and creating BOTS to browse
and click on your ads so like that
because it really hurts the value of
Google's product for that for their
purposes that approach makes sense
because if the burden of proof is on
them and they have no way to prove
whether or not it was you that was
bahding because let's be honest they
don't nope then they can never take it
away so as soon as they put the burden
of proof on you that allows them to
actually take it away in any case that
there's bahding and the reason why
Boateng is a huge issue is because like
Linus said when you're trying to sell a
product like an ad if there are rumors
out there even yeah you know some of the
ads are being bought 'add the
advertisers are coming after you and
going why am I paying you for nothing
yeah paying for absolutely nothing music
with twitch it's more complicated
because I mean you can't just go you
know oh twitch streamer X Y or Z you
know yo you're banned from the platform
until because I mean malicious actions
towards twitch streamers that have
nothing to do with them you know call me
you know you know whether it's as as
silly as you know fake pizza deliveries
or you know getting into a much more
malicious territory things like swatting
this is a huge thing it's something
about that community that thinks you
know trolling the on-air personality is
somehow appropriate so for twitch to
come in and start going heavy-handed
like anyone who has BOTS viewing their
stream you know you're banned you're cut
off your partnership you know your your
subscriber revenue is getting with hell
I mean that would be grossly unfair so
the the the issue is so multifaceted on
Twitch to you because as a new viewer to
a game you're gonna click on probably
one of the top broadcasters within that
game category so if someone's Boateng
they're not only trying to get more ad
revenue by displaying a higher view
count they might even just be trying to
get more exposure to get featured or
whatever it is so yeah it's just such a
I mean like what I'm trying to say is
maybe the person who's botting isn't
even doing it maliciously maybe they're
trying to help the content creator in
their own disturbed way which is
terrible by the way yes please don't do
that that's like the worst thing yeah
yeah click fraud view fraud
any kind of any kind of fraud is so hard
for a content creator especially a
smaller one I mean for actually this is
a great opportunity for me to get into
to get into what happened with our
Amazon Associates account but anytime a
content creator runs afoul of a much
larger entity whether we're talking
about Google Amazon twitch owned by
Amazon I'm speaking of much larger
entities it can be so hard and I
understand the reasons for this I mean
you got you got to think about it like a
program like you know an Amazon
Associates or like the creator
management team at a company like Google
which is like you know so there's
alphabet and then there's Google and
then there's YouTube and then there's
like sales and marketing and content
acquisition and content development and
then there's this tiny little team like
talent management and there are
literally millions of creators in some
cases at least hundreds of thousands
that much we know for sure so for even
someone like me where I would like to
think that I'm fairly significant I
think I'm in the top five hundred and
change youtubers let's say top 600 to be
safe even for me getting in touch with a
partner manager took until about a year
and change ago just to give you guys
some idea that was how long it took them
to retouch me get this they reached out
to me about the tech quickie channel did
I tell you that yeah
they weren't actually reaching out about
the lioness Texas Channel we completely
slipped through the cracks let's be fair
though the like the contact email on
that on that channel is extremely messy
so like it's possible no no I would have
noticed it's possible I get
notifications on my phone for every
email all right I would have noticed I I
was like wow they talked to me be still
my heart so um so especially for a small
content creator any time so okay anyway
it's really small teams managing this
stuff they only have so much bandwidth
to manually review things so a lot of
this stuff is done by automated systems
and to get someone to review it has to
be done in a priority fashion so if you
have 500 subscribers on YouTube
good luck like I lost my channel four
and a half years ago it took me over a
month to get it back
it took YouTube literally five years to
ever get in touch with me about anything
and when so getting into the Amazon
thing when I was found to be in breach
of Amazon's associates Terms of Service
my appeal process was basically yo can
we talk about this on the phone yo no um
good luck elsewhere so it is so it can
be pretty tough now with that said so so
leading back into because you know we
consider ourselves to be something of a
key online video program when it comes
to technology and I know a few people
who know a few people who know a few
people who we're willing to stick their
necks out on my behalf I do actually
have some news to share as far as the
whole Amazon thing goes so last week I
did announce that Amazon Associates our
Amazon links were we're dead our account
was dead and everything was dead since
that time I have managed to get on the
phone with someone and it looks like we
are going to work together to move
forward have actually got some some
notes that that I put together about
sort
of what what is exactly going on so it
was pointed out to me that anyone is
allowed even unless you've been found to
be like clearly maliciously abusing the
program anyone is allowed to change
their business model and to a compliant
business model and reapply so we've
actually been approved as of yesterday
morning for a new account and you know
here's what I have to say to you guys
this does mean there will be a new ID
you won't have seen that anywhere yet
because we're working very carefully to
go through our everything and make sure
that all of our practices all of our
editors know you know how to call it out
correctly you know all of our writers
know how to call it out correctly so we
want to make sure that we are 100%
aboveboard because I do not imagine for
a second that I have a longer a longer
leash than you know about this if we
were to ever violate the the terms of
the agreement again but here's what I'll
say if you're a creator out there who is
using the Amazon Associates Program or
if you're looking into the Amazon
Associates program because honestly in
spite of the stress that I've gone
through in the last week I still highly
recommend participating in the program
is a great great program it's a great
way to make additional revenue without
compromising any integrity as one of the
things that I love about it is that
because Amazon carries everything I can
recommend something on Amazon without
there being any conflict yeah because
they carry everything cuz they carry
everything I don't care if you buy the
LG g5 or the you know one plus three I
don't give a crap you just go out there
by one yeah both so here's what I'll say
carefully study the terms of the
agreement carefully clicking on all of
the hyperlinks within the terms of the
agreement because there are sub terms of
the agreement within the terms of the
agreement review them all some of it is
kind of vaguely worded but I understand
why they do this and it's to prevent
abuse
you can't cover every eventuality I get
that so some of the terminology does
seem a little gray but here's the advice
that I'm and this is my personal advice
this is not coming from Amazon I'm
making it very clear that I'm not
affiliated with Amazon in any way other
than that I am a participant in the
Amazon Associates program that's
something that they they say that you're
supposed to say so right there you go if
in the Terms of Service the way to read
it is keeping in mind the spirit of the
agreement which is that you are to show
your viewers or your audience applicable
products on Amazon especially ones that
you like or recommend and you are to
provide them with a means to quickly buy
it by clicking on a link that you
provide them so if you keep that in mind
while you read through it the rules are
much easier to understand so there you
have it we have we have learned our
lesson we were extraordinarily lucky
that we have some friends and some
friends who were who were very generous
to put their necks out and vouch for us
being good people who were not
maliciously abusing the program so huge
shout out to to all the people who
quietly helped us with this thank you
for that and look forward to seeing more
amazon links under our videos moving
forward yay and another thing is one of
the people that I was talking to you
about it said like some of the people
that work in that program are like
people from all walks of life all stages
of life so some of them like don't
necessarily I guess understand the newer
relations and stuff right so like keep
in mind that you have to just live
within the terms as they're there and
and then some just in case so yeah
lesson learned and it was a good one
speaking of lesson learned
I wonder what lessons will be learned
from this original source here is from
the bbc.com the United Kingdom is no
longer part of the European Union
wholly actual freaking crap
asterisk it's gonna take like at least
two years and the referendum is not
technically legally binding although
anyone in the House of Commons that goes
against it is probably committing like
career political suicide so it's
probably pretty much almost like
definitely gonna happen
unbelievable so I mean there's a lot of
incredible stuff here like if you guys
were like me you were probably glued to
your phone last night just looking at
all the mind-blowing stats around this
and and all the speculation going on but
here's a few key ones seventy one point
eight percent of eligible voters
attended I have never I mean I know that
it broke UK records but I mean the does
that does that break every record yeah
people cared holy crap and and and
that's with like extreme weather
conditions like flooding happening yeah
so if like the weather was all good we
probably would have been closer to like
75 or 80 percent unbelievable unheard of
and even more crazy is just how divided
the country was so in the end it was a
mere 52 to 48 percent vote it was
incredibly close England was just a
touch higher on the leave side of things
Wales was right there in the thick of
things at the average fifty two and a
half voted leave forty seven and a half
stay Scotland in Northern Ireland both
back to staying in the EU which is going
to have some very interesting
ramifications for the Scotland England
relationship over the next little bit
with Scotland going as far as to say yo
we might have actually you know done the
wrong thing when we stayed in the UK a
little while ago we might be referendum
referenda running again this is
interesting okay no ah one of my one of
my one of my favorite
québécois over there sent me this
Wikipedia article on the Quebec
referendum which was actually another
quick sit I guess we could call it when
when Quebec voted on whether to leave
Canada become an independent country for
the first time this was on October 30th
1995 and ninety three point five two
percent of people turned out to vote the
no option carried by fifty point five
eight percent so yes there have been
closer and
fifty point five eight yeah I had
forgotten how close that was so okay
alright thanks a prime you got me there
you got me there I should I should have
studied up my Canadian history better so
what does all this mean first let's talk
a little bit about what being a member
of the EU has meant in purely
technological terms cheaper air fares
easier easier studying and traveling and
living abroad on the mainland in
mainland Europe cheaper odd cellphone
chief or cell phone service so the way
that the EU has cracked down on roaming
charges within European Union members
has been a huge benefit to EU countries
I have I have been to the EU and
traveling over borders extraordinarily
easy very very cool essentially what the
EU does the European Union does is turn
the partner countries into a single
market so they're essentially
eliminating borders in a lot of ways for
goods services people money especially
with the Euro which was implemented what
like 10-15 years ago something like that
I can't remember when the Euro but it
wasn't like it was not it was in my
adult lifetime yeah ish like I remember
going to Paris and there still being
francs when I graduated high school I
don't know whatever so it began after
World War two and it was all about
Economic Cooperation and has and has
become more than that so the overall
goal is to boost trade create jobs to
lower prices all right so why then do
United Kingdom residents vote to leave
so they claim they were being held back
said it would imposed too many rules on
businesses and charged billions of
pounds per year in membership fees for a
little returned wanted Britain to take
back full control of its borders and
reduce the number of people coming to
work and live in the country because
that's one of the thing as much as many
Britons have been enjoying you know
going and working or living over the
English Channel there well the same is
true of anyone else who wants to go and
live in the UK they also objected to a
move towards what they saw as the
creation of a United States of Europe so
to speak to the membership fees there
was like a note that I read where I
think in 2014 slash 15 you know the
fiscal year 2014 slash 15 the the UK was
charged something like 8.8 billion
pounds in membership fees and they were
able to trace back about 5.5 billion
pounds of actual benefit for UK citizens
or UK residents so that includes stuff
like university grants housing grants
etc so there's a significant cost to
them for actually being a part of the
Union and that cost is essentially
absorbed by some of the other members of
the Union that contribute a bit less so
yeah I can I mean empirically I can kind
of understand the argument there but
that's looking at that one statistic in
a vacuum and ignoring you know the free
trade that it allows the travel free
would you convenience movement and you
know what but there's a lot of people
who don't give a crap about that that's
true and for them whatever just want to
stay in Leeds or wherever and and live
out their life there then maybe it's
better for them to just have a UK so
here's a few more interesting
interesting tidbits the pound has fallen
to its lowest since at night or fell I
don't know if it stayed there actually I
haven't looked recently but it fell to
its lowest since 1985 fun fact our our
amazon co UK affiliate payouts haven't
been cashed in a really long time I
heard yeah so so we actually like just
lost
like like a really long time I know so
we just lost like a lot a couple
thousand pounds or something I feel a
lot yeah oh I don't know how much
exactly but I don't know how much
exactly but it's like it's like not
insignificant so thanks for that brexit
um huh the Treasury forecast to rise
between 0.7 and 1.1 percent in mortgage
borrowing costs so like that might not
seem significant but I think it works
out to somewhere around a thousand
pounds a year extra ouch
and like possibly years added to your
mortgage so like compound interest dog
that sucks like yeah where the hell did
this come from
emergency pun the EU now has 1gb more
space I did not put that there
whoever did whoever did is fired so it's
pretty funny you know it was probably
ghost so you can't technically fire him
damn it all right well that's a happy
why is he more space I see what thank
you for that all right speaking of thank
you for that thank you to tunnel bear

something that could end up being more
relevant for Great Britain citizens than
it used to be I mean think about this
things like content law could now be
dramatically different between Britain t
this is where I'm tying it back into
tech a lot a lot of people asking in the
twitch chat content law could be very
different in Great Britain than it is in
the rest of the EU holy crap you could
have completely different oh oh
you could have completely different like
censorship layers you could have all
kinds of stuff that a VPN could be
beneficial for

now you're gonna be the one who gets us
in trouble with the sponsors that's
great no it doesn't have to be me
anymore that's fantastic I love it
random question yes this is you I was
thinking this when you're doing this but
if you had to open a restaurant what
kind of a restaurant would you open I
would open a food restaurant and it's
great because food ribs American Dad
actually has an episode where the main
character Stan opens what he calls the
food restaurant yeah his food restaurant
and his food restaurant is stupid and I
wouldn't open a food restaurant like
that because his served like I don't
know it's like chocolate dipped chicken
wings or whatever dumb stuff so my food
restaurant would be kind of like kind of
like what I think restaurants like white
spot try to do where they'll have like a
chicken teriyaki dish and they'll have
like a fish and chips and they'll have
like a butter chicken or like a variety
restaurant they have a variety except
the problem is that they do everything
in sort of this super non-authentic
pandering to - you know Midwestern you
know white people sort of way it's like
you're trying to butter chicken if you
didn't actually want to eat butter
chicken yeah exactly so so my food
restaurant would be kind of like like an
all
star All Star team yeah so it would it
would kind of have it would have meals
yeah so I don't actually know that we
would do family-style dishes I think it
would be individual individual meals and
I would want those individual meals too
late like it would I would kind of say
okay we're gonna have a larger than
normal kitchen yeah we're gonna have to
kind of absorb some similar operating
overhead there yeah um gonna have to
have a couple different chefs with
different backgrounds yeah you'll have
to have a little bit of background I
think you'll have to bring in some
consultants whenever you want to
introduce a new dish because you're not
gonna expect your you know Cajun
specialists to all of a sudden be able
to whip up an amazing Thai dish but I
would say okay let's absorb some extra
operating overhead here and let's be
able to put together kind of set set
meals so that any group of people can
come and dine and you know if I'm going
out with you know like a like a
Taiwanese partner or something yeah I
can take them there and they can get
some you know some dim sum or some you
know Singaporean style Hainanese chicken
or whatever and I can have a burger and
both of those things will legitimately
be somewhat authentic and good that
would be the objective of my restaurant
okay
what would your restaurant be I'm
curious now I don't I don't think this
is very on topic but that's okay I'm
curious that's okay I mean it's a
similar thing Luke and I actually talked
about this like a while ago and
essentially what we came up with was
like there's very like Americanized
dishes in each culture yep so like sweet
and sour pork from Chinese food chicken
teriyaki California roll California roll
yeah essentially having like Canadian
food just being like the variety of
other cultures of food that we all bring
together and call Canadian food because
we have a lot of awesome cultures
especially Vancouver it's great actually
there was another great restaurant idea
that I had a while back I would want it
to be like an icebreaker restaurant
I think I'd call it ice breakers and the
idea and here they think it was a hockey
theme very few sports bar ice breakers
with Aziz thank you we serve only Club
Seal you know
oh wow so my restaurant actually this
was another really good idea I thought
that I had every dish would be really
awkward to eat so like a plate of
spaghetti that is one long noodle right
and the idea would be that you would go
there with a date yeah knowing that no
one is going to be able to perfectly
consume every meal without getting
something dribbling down there are more
on their chin or whatever there's like
an ad that somebody pretty much like did
that really accept what it was was they
were like okay we're gonna pair these
people up and then the person that they
had to feed each other the food so I
found like food that both people liked
and then they had to feed each other the
food on like a first date so it was like
awkward but not essentially fun people
in the chat are just spamming our X 480
I don't know what I'm supposed to say
that there's rumors yeah which is we
can't talk about so here's the thing um
actually this is this is a good topic up
why aren't we talking about our X or our
a 480 because we do talk about
pre-release Hardware rumors very
frequently so we're not talking about it
because we know the answer we can talk
about rumors when we don't know the
answer but once we've signed a
nondisclosure agreement that says we are
going to independently evaluate the
products that is not going to affect the
way that we look at this product but we
are not going to say anything about it
until such time as the broad release of
information is allowed to go out as
specified by in this case AMD so once
we've signed that we can't talk about it
until it's time to talk about it so a
lot of people have asked you know why is
it that every text channel has a video
on the gtx 280 at exactly the same time
that is why and some people wonder why
embargoes are in place and they're like
oh this is you know it must be because
companies are paying people to do a
review or something like that it's so
that there's fair competition in the
review mark
yeah it's so that we don't get an
advantage from being Linus tech tips and
having you know 2.7 whatever subscribers
or that we don't see it at a cart first
or that we don't end up with a
disadvantage because we're in Canada
California and our card gets you know
held by customs for three days or
something like that so by having usually
it's anywhere from about five on the
very low end which is very frustrating
anywhere from about five to about twelve
days usually that's how long you have
with a product so that allows enough
time for something to go wrong like you
know for someone's kid to get sick and
need some chicken soup or whatever for
something to go wrong and for you to
still get your your coverage out at the
same time as everyone else apparently I
said 2.7 subscribers thank you twitch
chat 2.7 million subscribers I think you
said 2.7 whatever subscribers so you you
you didn't remember it was millions but
you knew it was something it's a good
job I mean I thought it might be
billions and then speaking of good job
cable company over charges might be even
worse than you realize the original
article here is from Ars Technica and I
love those guys
look at that flying sheet of money and
the other flying sheet of money and the
other flying sheets of money but this
image is not about freedom this image is
about getting fleeced by your cable
provider especially if you're an
American not that I believe for a second
that it's any better anywhere else so a
Senate report compares billing and
service records and finds massive over
charges who the cable companies oh my
goodness who would have thought not
Charter in its new subsidiary Time
Warner Cable
I have apparently been overcharging
customers at least 7.2 million per year
for equipment and service the
investigation is found so Time Warner
Cable overbilled customers nationwide an
estimated six hundred and thirty nine
thousand nine hundred and forty eight
dollars how do you get an estimate that
goes right down to the single dollar
anyway between January and April of this
year
and these problems are bad because
neither company had been issuing
automatic refunds or credits to
overcharged customer
so during the six and a half year time
period examined by the committee elec
and charter made no effort to trace
equipment overages to their origin
unless customers specifically asked them
to and did not provide notice or refunds
to customers comcast has in the past
overcharged customers but they do a much
better job at issuing refunds apparently
than Time Warner Cable Comcast told the
subcommittee that it only had a billing
error rate of 0.3% Comcast told them so
it must be true
Time Warner Cable will begin
investigating the overcharges only if
customers bring it to their attention so
if you're a Time Warner Cable customer
give them a ring over there and I don't
mean this kind of ring I mean the kind
of ring that goes yo Dawgs up I mean I
have a feeling that you would have to
sit on like a hold for at least two
hours to get through to them well yeah
you end up suffering more than the four
dollars that you probably individually
got overcharged anyway going forward
both companies will apparently provide
customers with a notice if they are over
charged that's good I wish we could
overcharged by like 7 million dollars
and just chill with it yeah I also like
I'd be down I actually I wouldn't be
down that would be totally wrong it
would be totally wrong but it would be
dope if it wasn't that was like that was
the thing that blew my mind with the
Charter and Time Warner Cable merger or
whatever mm-hmm
where the Time Warner Cable CEO
apparently had it written in it was
contract that he got some obscene amount
of money should ownership of the company
change three months later he was already
putting pen to paper for a change of
ownership of the company he was totally
interested in bettering the company yeah
no conflict of interest there one time
whatsoever you know it's funny how many
inherent conflicts of interest exist in
the world I mean and and this is all
like sanctioned stuff like you recently
Oh are we able to talk about further
that sorry your big thing that happened
recently that
been very exciting for you and kind of
crazy Oh like have you been are you out
I know I didn't tell anyone
oh okay okay we don't have to talk about
that um so I I what that's the
terminology okay um I'm moving I'm not
changing my sexuality or something like
that which is what it sounded like you
were saying I'm moving that's the big
news so when you deal with our realtor
okay whether you're buying whether
you're leasing or whatever the case may
be when you deal with a realtor
ultimately there exists as far as I can
tell an inherent conflict of interest
and to be clear I have met some very
good Realtors very good people but there
is an inherent conflict of interest
because the seller or the lessor not the
lessee or Celie whatever I don't care
you guys get the point so the seller or
whoever's leasing the property pays the
realtor fees they they pay that sort of
on top of the or out of the amount not
on top of sorry out of the negotiated
rate that the buyer ends up agreeing to
pay so the way it works is that let's
say hypothetically a house is a four
hundred and forty thousand dollars for
example let's say hypothetically so what
would happen is a typical real estate
agent commission is I think somewhere in
the 1/2 a quite a bit more than one I
think as high as like three or four
percent yeah I remember exact depends on
market conditions like in Vancouver
right now I think it's somewhere in the
1 to 4 whereas you know if housing
prices were closer to a hundred or two
hundred thousand dollars it would
probably be a little higher so so
basically what happens is the seller is
responsible for paying that to their
realtor that they have entered a
covenant with or whatever the case may
be to represent them so that realtor
ultimately like there's this code of
ethics or whatever which is great for
people who actually abide by those types
of codes but I've certainly met those
who
there's this code of ethics that says
that they have to represent you and blah
blah but the fact of the matter is they
get paid no matter what and they get
paid by the seller they get paid more if
the rate is higher so okay if they're
representing the seller then that's
great but there's a realtor potentially
and often in in many cases for the buyer
as well who also gets paid by the seller
who also gets paid a proportion of the
amount that the property sells for and
who the selling realtor has to split the
Commission with if there's a buying real
to her present so this creates all kinds
of conflicts like choosing a buyer which
you're not supposed to do based on then
being self represented in which case
this the sellers realtor takes the
entire Commission versus another buyer
who has a realtor who is sticking up for
their best interests there's dual agency
which is like the the most broken thing
ever or one realtor represents both
parties super illegal in like most of
Canada because it's incredibly messed up
not here yet that's for sure um where
basically there's these negotiating
these negotiators on both side both of
whom it is in their best interest to
flip through properties as quickly as
possible at as high rate as possible and
I'm to believe as a buyer especially
that this is somehow in my best interest
ah good luck fortunately my realtor is
actually the dad of someone that my wife
went to high school with and like their
families know each other and so there's
there's some trust there and he is he
has not he has not steered me wrong
which is good but anyway let's move on
to this fantastic article over here on
polygon counter-strike player files suit
against valve over illegal gambling
surrounding csgo very interesting I mean
it was a matter of time yeah before
skins and match I mean you've already
got match fixing
so you're as close to real gambling as
you can be before being declared real
gambling that only adults can
participate in you
age of majority and all that stuff that
goes along with normal gambling sites
and gambling participation and gambling
establishments there is also something
that happened recently I'm trying to
find it something along the lines of one
of the betting sites had a deal with a
streamer where they would tell him like
when he was going to win so that he
would bet higher on those and then like
freak out when he won essentially just
the scummiest thing I've ever heard of
so creating more glamour around the
round aesthetic of of betting so
Connecticut resident Michael John McLeod
has filed a suit currently seeking
class-action status and I don't actually
see that being a difficult thing to
achieve here no against valve and three
skin gambling and selling sites and the
complaint alleges that Valve knowingly
allowed and has been complicit in
creating sustaining and facilitating a
market where players and third-party
trade art and excuse me where players
and third parties trade weapons skins it
continues that they knowingly allowed
supported and or sponsored illegal
gambling by allowing millions of
Americans to link their individuals team
accounts to third-party websites that's
that's interesting because I mean you
know there's plenty of legitimate uses
for Valve's login credentials being
valid on a third party website like oh
say for example I don't know Linus tech
tips forum where you can use your steam
credentials and all the encryption and
account management is done over on valve
side we never even get it we just get a
hash or a token or whatever and you can
use your your valve two-factor
authentication all that good stuff so
there's plenty of legit uses for that
but I can see where they're kind of
coming from here in the eSports gambling
economy this is further further
allegations skins are like casino chips
that have monetary value outside the
game itself because of the ability to
convert them directly into cash it also
alleges that some third-party csgo
websites don't require age verification
which allows minors to bet as well
Bloomberg has reported that csgo skin
gambling is currently a two billion
dollar industry so in some
valve ohms the league sells the casino
chips and receives a piece of the
casinos income stream through foreign
websites in order to maintain the
charade that valve is not promoting and
profiting from online gambling Wow
oh I mean I'm not a legal expert we
should get like that should be added to
our lower third actually there's
permanently not a lawyer
thanks to next to my twitter handle it
should just say not not a lawyer
that line is tech tip - tech yeah but I
gotta say that sounds from just a sort
of like a rational reasonable person
who's been observing kind of this weird
environment over the last few years that
sounds not quite bulletproof but pretty
compelling yeah
it's not great everyone's never in
twitch chats likes hell your skin's so
your skin's now get out I honestly see
those who look bubble of what ever since
this whole thing began I mean I was
always kind of questioning it because
it's like huh don't you normally have to
get like licenses to gamble yeah it's
like pretty tightly regulated in Canada
you have to spend a certain amount of
your income on anti-gambling
advertisement like yes is it really
tightly regulated industry deal like a
huge deal and you know they've they've
gotten away with it for so long just
because I think people don't really
understand like the people who would
come after them don't really understand
what's happening so this might shut a
bit more light on that because yeah it
is not a good thing in my opinion I mean
it's just it's so accessible because
it's literally using something that you
get as a drop potentially in a game that
you've paid for and you're playing to
get you tied into it
mm-hm and whether valve agrees or not
that they are quote unquote facilitating
it I mean I think there's an argument to
be made there again not a lawyer don't
understand law very well at all
but I think that there is an argument to
be made against valve in this situation
so will be interesting to see what
happens that's for sure to be clear no
means no you said you didn't know the
law very well I'm just making sure
you're at least aware of that I'm just
I'm gonna have all sorts of stuff on my
Twitter of yeah I'm just I'm not oh yeah
you can you can find him at at Nick LMG
or something like that is that is that
right is there an underscore in there no
all right so Microsoft will use steam to
sell Windows games not just its own
store Wow
a move for Microsoft that actually looks
like they actually care
very nice original article here is from
Ars Technica and a couple of their
latest couple of their latest games so
Forza 6 apex and Killer Instinct have
done well in the store but quantum break
did not so maybe they're kind of gone
out gee maybe we don't have to be the
only store that sells our games maybe we
could give someone else the cuddle valve
does take a very significant cut um but
Phil Spencer said Microsoft will ship
games on Steam again and noted that
while some game releases have done well
in Windows Store quantum break wasn't
our best PC release and Gears of War
Ultimate Edition was ok awesome I'm
excited because I almost played nothing
that isn't on Steam it is so convenient
it's like it's prohibitive to not have
your game on Steam nowadays it just
feels like Steam is the way to gain I
mean I guess there's Blizzard battle.net
or whatever but still you can still
technically launch those games through
Steam you just have to yeah yeah um
we've got a couple other sort of rapid
fiery topics here uh SanDisk made an
iPhone case with built-in storage up to
128 gigs of extra storage all it does is
bulk up the phone surprisingly little
actually not that badly and instead of
investing in additional $300 or whatever
it is to get an iPhone with that amount
of storage you can just have a bumper
case on it that has a little bit more
bulk at the bottom by the lightning can
so that there can be a power
pass-through and so that it can have a
data interface to that storage end off
you go
the one problem with this is that you
will be limited to USB two speeds but
reverse requires a companion app mm-hmm
it can only store certain things it
backs up your camera roll it does
password protect your photos and any
files that have that that are on there
so that's nice and you can also get a
battery pack on it for an extra forty
bucks
yeah nineteen hundred milliamp hour
battery pack I mean that will turn your
iPhones success into like a bit of a
brick but 32 gigs of storage is 60 bucks
64 gigs is a hundred and 128 is 130 see
this by the way Apple is how pricing for
additional flash storage should work
yeah yeah it's kind of no there's like
some iphone 7 rumors or something I'm
not really sure how much I care about
that there were a couple other things
that I thought were pretty pretty
interesting where did they go
but you know what let's call that in for
the day thanks for watching wine show
and a huge thanks to Nick you guys again
you can find him over at at Nick lmg
over on Twitter I'm gonna post that in
the suppose that in the twitch chat
let's hope I don't have any live tweets
on there yeah let's help you let's hope
you don't go might shut me down thanks
for watching guys we'll see you again
next week same bat-time same bat-channel
thanks for watching talk about Detroit
they do
like there's the same clothes and people
are posting videos but they have mantra
and nothing's gonna happen
unless there's been a change
yeah okay people wanted us to talk about
iPhone 7 okay fine
iPhone 7 rumors expected to be a
revision of iPhone 6 Wow is that really
a note on this okay forget it it doesn't
have a headphone jack that's the rumor
surprise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
