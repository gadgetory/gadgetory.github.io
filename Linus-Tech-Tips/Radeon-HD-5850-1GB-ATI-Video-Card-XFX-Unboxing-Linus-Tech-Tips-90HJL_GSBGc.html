unboxing the XFX Radeon 58 50 now these
launched at the same time as the 58 70s
but the availability hasn't been quite
as good for them so let's get started
here and cut the seal there we go so
it's pretty much based around the same
chip the same amount of RAM all that
kind of stuff but the difference between
the 58 70 and the 58 50 is that it's
clocked a little bit lower and it's also
missing a couple of the deep what is it
the processing cores or something like
that anyway it's clocked at 725
megahertz and the RAM is clocked at 4.00
gigahertz instead of 4.8 gigahertz like
the 58 70 so let's get this sort of shoe
box style box open and like all the 58
70's it comes with a free copy of dirt 2
and then we've got a quick install guide
here there you are there's your quick
install guide then there's a little okay
here's a full installation guide which
is actually not that much longer than
the quick install guide but that covers
the software aspect of things there we
go and then we have a drivers disc ATI
graphics pH a driver you're gonna want
to download the latest drivers anyway
though don't bother with that under here
we have one of these cool door hangers
do not disturb I'm gaming then inside
here we have play heart okay so we've
got two molex to PCI Express 6 pin
adapters one crossfire bridge which is
quite normal for a Radeon card and then
we have a DVI to VGA adapter if you're
actually still using a VGA monitor which
please get a new monitor because that is
quite ancient at this time okay
inside here we will find the 5850 now
you can see it's not quite as well
padded as the 5870 but it's also a
slightly smaller card so let's get this
out let's get this closed and here is
the 5850 so on the front of the card
you've got XFX as graphics and then
you've got the same fan they use on the
5870 then on the top of the card you can
see we've got the ATI Radeon logo to
crossfire bridges although I've heard
performance is actually better if you
use just one
the back of the card we start seeing a
pretty big difference here because
instead of having a black shroud on the
back it's only a bare PCB with a back
plate so that's quite different from the
other card now on the back we find two
PCI Express six pin connectors and again
you're gonna notice the difference you
know what why don't I just grab the
other card here for comparison okay so
here's the 5870 compared to the 5850 you
can see it's actually quite a bit longer
but on the 5870 the PCI Express
connectors are here whereas on the 5850
they're at the back so you actually have
to account for an extra like you know
probably to three centimeters for that
connector and the cables coming off the
back so it's not that much shorter now
these are both PCI Express 16x cards and
they both have the same connectors at
the back so you can connect up to three
monitors one DisplayPort and then you
can do either HDMI and DVI or DVI and
DVI it will not work with HDMI DVI DVI
and you can't use a passive DisplayPort
to DVI adapter anyway thank you for
checking out my unboxing on the XFX
Radeon HD 5830</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
