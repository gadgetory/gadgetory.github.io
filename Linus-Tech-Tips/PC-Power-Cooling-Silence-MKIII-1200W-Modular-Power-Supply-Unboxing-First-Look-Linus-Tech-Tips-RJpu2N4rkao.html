the pc power and cooling silencer MK 3
1200 watt this is a very odd way to lay
out the text given you're supposed to
read it in this order I don't know if
there's any culture on earth that reads
things in this order but you know
whatever if the power supply is good
enough that it doesn't really matter
because this is basically the equivalent
to like the boyfriend or girlfriend that
has it all like looks and brains and
conversational ability and like the
ability to like you know attract ducks
with bread and when they throw it and
just like all of it you can do anything
pretty much so yeah it has a seven-year
warranty 80 plus platinum efficiency
it's got a modular interface that
actually looks pretty baller so we're
going to have a closer look at this once
we open it up and it has my favorite
thing in the world a silent fan mode
operation feature the fan does not turn
on until it reaches 600 watts so that
means this power supply is passively
cooled up to 600 watts it is also rated
for its full output at a 50 degree
ambient temperature it has all Japanese
solid caps that are rated up to 105
degrees Celsius it uses a single
powerful 12 volt rail so it does have
the usual industrial protections however
if you are or you're not comfortable
with that you can always choose a multi
rail power supply but for those of you
who want that hassle free no matter what
I plug something into they won't be any
you know over current protection that's
triggered this is pretty much the way to
go up to ninety two percent efficiency
although i think that's on 230 volt AC
and honestly that silent mode switch is
like the be-all and end-all of features
to me because for a power supply like
this where it gets up to 600 watts
before turning on the fan that means
that even a fairly beefy gaming system
with you know a single or dual even dual
GPU cards is almost never even going to
turn on your power supply and if your
silence aficionado like myself then
that's a big deal for you let me just
see if I missed anything here large one
hundred and forty millimeter fan and
active power factor correction
all I could said ah yes silent mode so
it gives you the key of which switch
position is which which is good because
on the power supply itself it actually
doesn't tell you so there you go so the
power supply itself let's have a look at
the physical attributes you got your
honeycomb mesh on the back you got your
power switch here you got your silent
mode switch here power input very very
clean overall look and aesthetic we've
come become used to this with PC power
and cooling silencer products so you got
your white finish which is extremely
resilient and hide scratches incredibly
well because it's very matte and like a
matte white finish will actually hide
blemishes way better than a matte black
finish also got the black and silver
rather platinum black and platinum
accents on ok and everything even down
to see these kinds of details make all
the difference in the world everything
down to the quality control stickers
uses that same kind of color scheme so
it'll look really great in your system
silencer MK 3 got like a nice shiny
badge there there's your 140 millimeter
dual ball bearing fan and they're inside
are all those beefy heat sinks because
you can have the most efficient power
supply in the world but it's not going
to be able to help put 600 watts of
power to your computer passively unless
it's got some decent cooling inside so
the unit definitely has some weight to
it now it's not fully modular however I
personally don't find that to be the end
of the world because all the cables that
are on here I hope is that thing oh
that's rough okay almost all the cables
on here are ones that everyone will lead
anyway so you've got two PCIe six plus
two pins you can have a look at this
leaving here at decent sleeving not the
best I've seen but definitely far from
the worst so you're masking most of the
color of those yellow cables but not all
of it you've got a six plus two
configuration which is my favorite by
far and these are nice thin wire so
you'll be able to tuck this away pretty
easily if you want if you're only using
if you only require a 6-pin they've got
an additional cap down here so I'm
guessing that's helping with the power
stability somewhat and then your 24 pin
is a twenty plus 4 again wouldn't have
minded seeing dark cables or somehow
stealth cables in some way but again
this leaving is not bad
so that hides a lot of the color there
when you do in your cable management now
this is this is something I would have
preferred to see just one permanently
attached to your CPU four plus four pin
connectors so most motherboards on the
desktop anyway only require one of those
which means that most people won't won't
need the two pre-attached so that's one
cable that most people are going to end
up cracking away somewhere let's have a
look at what we've bought in terms of
modular cables I mean it kind of okay
here here let's finish up with the
accessories so it comes with a power
cable some you know zip ties you've got
five of them in there which will sort of
go thirty percent of the way to cable
managing your system okay hopefully you
can you can afford this power supply you
can probably go buy some black zip ties
some thumb screws love to see these
included with high-end power supplies
because not every case includes thumb
screws for mounting the power supply so
it's just that it's nice to see those
little finishing touches dear valued
customer thank you for this and if you
have any customer support issues please
contact us here and finally small
instruction manual in a variety of
languages now let's have a look at some
of the modular cables so we've got a six
plus two we have a six plus two well
yeah 5 6 plus do and finally just to
shake things up a little bit we have a 6
plus 2 so that means you have a total of
six 6 plus 2 pin power connectors which
means you can install either three
graphics cards natively anyway you can
install three graphics cards that
require two can two connectors or you
can do to graphics cards that each
require three connectors or I mean if
you wanted you could have six graphics
cards that each require one connector
but I really can't think of an
application that some motherboards they
will want like an extra 6-pin PCIe for
auxiliary power for example and let's
have a look at how these connect so
they've got little rubber dust for
silicon dust covers on them and then all
you got to do is line up the the bump
here with the bump on the inside plug
that bad boy in I think oh right so this
is what I do so some of them have four
pins and some of them have five pins so
that'll go there and then you
put this ring on here and it's plugged
in very nice looking cables so these
ones are all black unlike the
pre-attached cables which is all the
more reason why I would have liked to
see more modular cables on this one nice
flat all black ribbon cables terminated
with heat shrink and then again
terminated on this side with just all
completely black mesa ribbon cable myth
so these are these are fantastic the
length is pretty good on all the cables
on this power supply this is one of the
longest 24 pins I've seen in a while
it's almost exactly one Linus arm in
length and the eight pins for all their
multitudinous are also quite long about
one Linus arm in length if anything that
24 pin could probably be a little bit
shorter without hurting anybody's
feelings now in terms of other modular
cables I'm not quite the selection that
I'm used to seeing on high-end power
supply so you've got a single for molex
cable so let's go ahead and just grab
this out of here so that you guys can
have a look and we'll sort of judge the
length and decide if it if it makes
sense so this is one of those those five
ones that'll go right there okay screw
that in so that should get handcuffed
most systems don't require much in the
way of 4-pin molex these days and it's
more than a Linus arm link so you should
be able to reach whatever you need to
but if you do need more molex connectors
you will have to consider that about
this power supply though you can use
splitters it does come with one single
4-pin molex too floppy connector adapter
again nice black looks very sleek and
then for sada you've got a four port
harness a 4-point harness and another
400 feet can hook up to 12 SATA drives
up to the power supply natively and then
you can run those cables up to three
different places again these look quite
long so in terms of cable management you
will be able to reach pretty much
wherever you go with any of the cables
will come up with power supply so this
is again well over a minus arm length in
terms of overall length I think that
pretty much covers it so the things to
remember seven-year warranty 80 plus
platinum the fan doesn't turn on until
you reach 600 watts and it is a 1200
watt single rail power supply thank you
