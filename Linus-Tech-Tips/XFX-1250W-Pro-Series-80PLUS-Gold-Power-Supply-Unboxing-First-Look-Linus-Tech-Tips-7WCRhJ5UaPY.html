so this one is slightly different from
the last XFX power supply that I took a
look at and in terms of the overall
platform in the overall feature set it
is fairly similar however this is a
higher wattage unit then the 80-plus
Platinum 1000 watt that we looked at
before so this is a 1250 watt power
supply which yes there are higher
wattage power supplies out there but I
would say that for all practical intents
and purposes 1200 watts or 1250 watts or
whatever you want to call it is pretty
much as high-end as you need to go
because you can power almost anything I
can imagine I mean okay yeah you can add
Peltier's and things like that to your
system that would make it consume more
power but with this you can easily power
for graphics cards a quad core all
rather I have club cores don't even
high-end anymore I forgot a 6 core CPU
and you know all the extra little random
peripherals and accessories that you
could want so the one that we had a look
at before was the thousand watt one and
that was more of a limited edition SKU
and I just hold on a second hold on just
a moment so the thousand watt is the
limited edition 80 + platinum and then
the 1050 and the 1250 watt are the black
edition non limited edition one so these
are 80 plus gold which is to be expected
because 80 plus gold is a little bit
easier to achieve especially with a 1250
watt unit I mean look at what you'd be
expecting from a 1250 watt 80-plus
Platinum unit we're talking what 90%
efficiency basically for 12 hundred and
50 watts so what does it have in terms
of the overall other features that are
similar to the 80 + Platinum unit the
answer is a whole lot it actually looks
very similar so XFX has done a great job
I mean back when they first launched
their powers
as I was looking at it going well what
can XFX do any different and what
they're doing is they're using a very
high quality manufacturer for the power
supply units themselves and what they've
also done is they found a way to set
apart their aesthetic from what others
are doing so you look at it you go well
really anything but black tends not to
look that great like you go and you do
like you know like a bronzy colored
power supply and it might look kind of
cool on its own but you go and put that
in a system it looks kind of out of
place so I was like okay well what are
they gonna do and what they did do is
they did kind of a unique overall look
so it's got a very XFX e look to it it's
still black they have done kind of
silver accents and rather than going
there rather than going the you know
cover it with gold colored stuff root
that a lot of guys have done with their
I 80 plus gold power supplies and when
you combine good aesthetics with very
high quality I'd say you
generally speaking end up with a winner
so that's that's what they've decided to
do with their power supply products and
I have no hesitations whatsoever in
recommending their power supply products
so they do okay I'm gonna say it one
more time they do use a high quality
manufacturer and then they do offer a
five year guarantee
that's from XFX so that's their
legendary warranty service so it's hard
to go wrong that way as well let's have
a look at the modular fan interface
where you're gonna find a few different
things so you'll see your motherboard
modular connectors so it's a fully
modular power supply you also see a CPU
connector so that uses an 8 pin to a pin
which I'm gonna find right about here
all right so that guy plugs in right
there and then what you see is three
more PCIe connectors and then an
additional PCIe or CPU connector so that
means you can either use this guy right
here to do another 8 pin although I
would personally argue that unless
you're using a dual socket motherboard
that is entirely unnecessary so a single
8 pin even if you're okay I don't buy
dual socket I mean dual CPU sockets not
dual eight pin sockets so I would argue
if you have a single CPU you're going to
be more than enough served by a single
eight
connecter even if your motherboard has
two connector slots so what that means
is you could use this power supply to
provide up to eight PCIe connectors so
that is up to 4-way dual pin requiring
graphics cards so you can see each of
these connectors nice long cables has
dual six plus two pin connectors at the
end and XFX includes four of them so
with the 1050 watt they include three
and with the 1250 watt they include four
and then they also include the CPU one
so you can actually use it whichever way
you want because if you're running two
or three graphics cards and you do have
the dual 8 pin connectors on your
motherboard then I guess you might as
well use them both high quality power
cord included very very thick good to
see it's just those little touches that
do make a difference
oh I want to talk about you know what
I'll talk about that after ok let's have
a look at the rest of the included
connectors so you got your 24 pin which
is pretty much bog standard I would hope
that any PC power supply comes with a
24-pin connector ok so we've got three
buy SATA connector one so two of them
are right angle one of them is straight
then we've got a 2 by SATA connector one
right angle one straight that's what I'd
recommend running up to your optical
drive then we have another 3 by SATA
power connector and finally another 3 by
SATA power connector so that's nine that
you can run over to your hard drive bays
and then to that you can run up to your
optical drives which is a good balance
ok next we've got a dual molex I'm a big
fan of this cuz I don't use many molexes
in my case so I'd run that to my pump
and I'd run that to my fan controller
and then I'd be pretty much done then
we've got one of those molex to do a
floppy adapters just in case you still
use any floppy devices in your system
whether it's a card reader or whatever
else they need floppy power they need it
you got a triple molex and then you've
got another triple molex that is also
included now this is cool check this out
I wonder if we can see the solid link
interface down there you know what we
can't see that but we can see something
so I want you guys to check this out you
know how on most modular power supplies
you see a big bundle of cables coming
off can you see in
sort of gonna try and get an angle or
you can see along the right-hand edge so
most modular power supplies you'll see a
whole bunch of cables that are soldered
down there and then run over to the back
of the PCB that makes up the modular
interface which is going to be right
behind here the way that these power
supplies work in order to conserve
efficiency is rather than using those
cables and those soldered points which
tend to be somewhat inefficient they use
solid pieces actually here they have a
good diagram here where is it they use
solid metal pieces to run right off the
PCB onto the modular interface itself so
you can see what it looks like with this
with this back piece taken off so that
does provide I mean we're talking very
small amounts of increased efficiency
but you'd be amazed how much how much
these things can add up over time like
I'm aware of at least 180 plus volt
power supply where this was a less
reputable manufacture this was not fxfx
so don't don't take that away from this
story but what they did was when they
actually sent their unit away to the 80
plus certification committee they
included cables that were 30% shorter
because just that extra little bit of
resistance that they're taking away from
the power output earned them an 80 plus
gold certification instead of 80 plus
silver so that's something to bear in
mind if you're buying a power supply you
want to buy from someone repeatable who
doesn't sort of fudge the numbers in
order to hit a particular plateau that's
actually one of the other things that
XFX really feels is important so they're
capacitors and their operating specs are
based on a standard operating condition
of 50 degrees so they're not actually
going to go ahead and put the power
supply in a colder environment which
does help it perform more efficiently in
order to achieve a better rating they're
putting it in a more realistic scenario
so they've got all Japanese capacitors
as well as testing them Wow cool
so they test them at 50 degrees and
they're rated to withstand up to a
hundred and five degrees automatic
protection sensor so you got all of your
usual safety certification
I would expect that from someone like
XFX as well as from the manufacturer
that is building the power supply in the
first place because I mean when it comes
to actual manufacturing plants someone
like an X FX is going to stand behind
the warranty for you they're gonna
support the product for you they're
gonna bring it to market for you they're
gonna do you know promotions and then I
ARS and all that good stuff for you but
when it comes to an actual factory not
everyone owns a power supply factory so
they are using a very very high quality
OEM arguably the best one out there
hybrid fan mode so we're finally on to
what I think is really the best feature
of this particular series of power
supplies their Black Edition full
modular and that is hybrid fan mode here
so when you enable that feature what
you're actually doing and they include a
useful graph right on the power supply
itself I'll show you that graph when I
find it ah very cool check this up so up
to 20 percent load plus or minus 5
percent you it operates in silent mode
that means your fan is off remember 20
percent load on a 1250 watt power supply
is about 300 watts you'd be hard-pressed
to find a system that idles
about 300 watts and in fact let's take
this system right here which is dual GTX
580 s and a 2600 K nope
what is this this is a 39 3930k 6 core
processor and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm
gonna show you guys this system idles at
144 Watts check that out can you see
that it's okay you'll have to take my
word for it it aisles at 144 Watts 8
gigs around the works so that means that
whenever you're browsing the web or
doing just general low maintenance stuff
your power supply fan is gonna be off
that's great not only for noise
reduction but also for dust reduction
that means your power supply isn't even
going to get dust caked into it because
unless you're actually playing a game
rendering a video or doing something
intensive like that your fan isn't even
going to be on so this is by design if
you flick the switch you know don't be
scared that your fan isn't on but yeah
pretty cool right ok
two more things one is that this is a
single rail power supply so it's ain't
capable of providing up to 104 amps on a
single rail that is only 2 watts shy of
the entire rated output of this power
supply so what that does mean is that
you don't have to worry about which
connector you're plugging what I draw a
device into so you know short of
accidentally plugging everything in your
system into a single molex connector and
overheating this entire wire which is
very unlikely to happen you don't have
to worry about having you know two
graphics cards on one rail and one
graphics card on the other rail and
accidentally triggering the overcurrent
protection you don't have to worry about
that you just go ahead and worry free
you plug everything into everything and
it's all coming from a single 12 little
rail inside the power supply so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
XFX pro 12 50 watt solid link 80 plus
gold power supply and don't forget to
subscribe to learn his tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and honestly if you're shopping
for a product supply tomorrow look for
one with hybrid phantoms so remember the
XFX
1050 watt 80 plus gold the 1250 180 plus
gold as well as the 1000 watt 80 plus
platinum all have this feature and it's
very very cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
