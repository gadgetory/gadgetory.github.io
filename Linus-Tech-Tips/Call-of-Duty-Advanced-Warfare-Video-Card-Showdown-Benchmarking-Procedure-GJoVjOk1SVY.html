obviously there has to be a new Call of
Duty release if you want to see all of
our videos between this year's and next
year's call of duty benchmarking video
stay subscribed the cooler master
Neptune 240m features an exclusive pump
design and their new Silencio fans to
provide impressive near-silent
performance click now to learn more call
duty advanced warfare has been very
surprisingly receiving really good
reviews from even people like
totalbiscuit my theory that this is
likely due to the third developer
sledgehammer their addition to the mix
seems to have not only added creativity
but also a three-year development cycle
which is apparent quite early due to the
fairly extensive settings menu and
surprisingly enjoyable gameplay Before
we jump into performance I must address
the rather unfortunate fact that
multiplayer FPS has been capped at an
odd 91 FPS well I'm happy this isn't a
30fps cap which we've seen in some games
in the past I wish it was either
non-existent as it should be or 120 or
140 for FPS because it is a first-person
shooter and I know that there are gamers
like us out there that would like to use
our gaming grade monitors which are
really fast and developers aren't
necessarily accommodating to us wanting
to play their game the best possible way
for our 1080p benchmarking I ran
everything on extra or when that wasn't
necessarily available hi alongside SMA
82 x and was quite happy with the
results surprisingly enough the game
actually looks quite good and as yet
again totalbiscuit has pointed out the
textures are impressively detailed for a
call of duty king keeping that in mind i
was very happy to see that even cards
like our radeon 260x set an average
frame rate of over 60 FPS when running
at 4k we actually kept all the quality
settings the same in order to push the
system that much harder even with the
much heavier workload over half these
cars we tested at 4k we're able to push
an average of over 60 FPS
which was great to see I don't believe
this game currently has sli support but
once it does if you want to flex your
performance muscles even more you can
have fun with the built-in super
sampling settings as well another thing
to remember is that we don't run our
gaming benchmarks with overclocked
graphics cards so these cards are all
running their factory overclocking
speeds also for those who may be
wondering we're still using our default
graphics test bench which should be able
to remove any cpu-based bottlenecks so
we can see the actual performance
differences between the graphics cards
themselves now that's all out of the way
we're going to run you guys through our
benchmarking run for call of duty
advanced warfare after a really long
cinematic and a press F key for
reconnaissance part of the mission you
spawn in on traffic one thing you're
going to want to do on this one is
always stay behind the kind of like
squad leader guy Gideon there his name
so much about who was so in this section
it looks like they're running with their
animation but you actually just want to
walk you sprint the very first section
and then you walk once you get behind
them that you only breach through this
drawer door once a Jenny passes it so
you have to completely smash down to
simple 40 anyways these guys will come
up and aim down at the street for a
second screaming at friendlys always a
good idea and then you follow Joker up
onto this side ramp once you're up there
again it looks like they're running but
you actually just want to hold w don't
sprint here as you'll go away tooth us
once you're at the end of this platform
you're going to want to jump down but
kind of delay a little bit like I do or
else you go a little bit too quickly and
then follow Gideon up and close to the
wall you're at the middle section where
it says climb on the wall so kind of
follow him there and then walk up in a
small I delay there again because Gideon
takes a second to get into place and I
want my timing at the end of this to be
perfect magnetic hands find the wall and
like he says dodge the window I usually
try to make sure my hand goes right
along the side of the pay me of that
window that way I know I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be climbing this part is
canned but then when you turn around the
corner all you need to do is slowly walk
up to the plant and then sent the new
charge and then the whole rest of the
thing should basically run itself
through you want the benchmark to end
exactly after this extremely dangerous
explosive goes off i love how he's like
centimeters out of the way but anyways
so right when that kind of falls through
you want the benchmark to end right
there not as you're jumping in you want
to end it before you start dumping it
but if games aren't you think and you
prefer books or if you're like me and
you enjoy both gaming and books you
should check out audible com there an
audiobook provider with a library of
over 150,000 titles and they can make
sure that it can keep up with your
reading or rather listening on the go
whether you're working out community on
public transit or adventuring like the
characters in JRR tolkien's the children
of hurin I hope I'm pronouncing that
correctly the book started out as a
series of manuscripts left behind by JRR
Tolkien himself and was completed by his
son Christopher Tolkien and was then
published in 2007 I being a Tolkien fan
enjoyed it quite a lot and it's also
narrated by Christopher freakin Lee so

other things that may or may not come
out in November if you want a shirt that
isn't this one but hopefully Linus will
be no doubt the fishy I down with the
fish eh I think that's a reference to
ghosts which was a horrible horrible
game but anyways if you don't like
