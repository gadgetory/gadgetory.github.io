tell you what is special about it it is
a quad-core processor at 3.5 gigahertz
with eight Meg's of cache that makes it
AMD's fastest quad core in terms of
sheer frequency ever and we are going to
open it up it uses a true quad core
design which is what mostly everyone is
using these days and it fits in a
standard am-3 socket and he's really
done a phenomenal job actually fits in
an AM 2 Plus socket - AMD has really
done a phenomenal job of making sure
that their customers are getting great
backwards and forwards compatibility out
of their new CPUs their old motherboards
and yeah kudos to AMD so this chip
supports ddr2 as well as ddr3 that is an
AM 3 or nay m 2 plus socket it is AMD
vision black you can see the branding
sticker is put on there a little bit
after the fact so you should combine it
with an HD 5000 series graphics card as
well as an 800 series chipset to get the
best possible experience according to
the AMD vision marketing campaign that
AMD does here is a quick start guide as
well as your warranty information we're
not really going to go through that in
any great detail so we'll have a look at
the chip itself it comes with a phenom 2
sticker which you can put on your case
Hey look at that I haven't seen a
sticker like that before look it slides
into a little thing we pull it out with
your thumb and it doesn't go anywhere
you know that's kind of different and
AMD's actually changed their other CPU
clinch a little bit too it uses a
slightly different design now so we'll
have a look at the chip itself there it
is venom 2 can see all the numbers on
the top of the chip so there's a 940
pins on the bottom now that's an m3
compatible you know and we'll have a
look at the included thermal solution
since this is their highest clocked quad
core this is going to come with a fairly
beefy cooler I can already see it has a
copper well fairly beefy for a stock key
warning
it's not gonna really really compare to
that thing but it'll be reasonably close
well never mind it'll run fine unless
you're overclocking in which case you
should probably get something to okay so
this is the cooler that debuted with the
original socket 939 dual core Opterons I
remember this one and back then it had
an 80 mil fan which was slightly cooler
and more impressive but it still has
this looks like a 60 millimeter fan and
it's a slightly deeper one it's not a
low-profile one so you should get some
pretty good airflow out of it
it's about four heat pipes a copper base
and aluminum fins and that's too much
all there is to say about it like I said
if you're running it stock this is going
to run nice and cool nice and quiet for
you but if you are overclocking you're
probably going to want to throw
something a little bit more impressive
on your brand-new Black Edition CPU is
black edition so this is a black edition
chip that means it does come with a
fully unlock multiplier for as amv puts
it maximum control or for from my
perspective lazy easy overclocking so it
means you can tweak it as much as you
possibly can without really knowing
anything about overclocking which is
great you just turn up the multiplier
turn up the core voltage and boom you're
done now something I want to investigate
so you'll have to stay tuned for a
future video is whether or not this quad
core can be unlocked to a six core it
depends on what kind of manufacturing
process AMD is using and I hope to
update you in the future don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips to hear
that video and more subscribe it's the
gold button on the left or the right I
don't remember where it is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
