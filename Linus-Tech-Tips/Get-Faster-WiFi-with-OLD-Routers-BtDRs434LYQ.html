especially if you're trying to get
coverage in a large house with a
traditional single router slash access
point set up and that is exactly why we
are here at James's in-laws house today
because James stays here in the guest
room from time to time and it's upstairs
where the Wi-Fi reception just plain
bites so a sous sponsored this video
where we're gonna show you there a imesh
system where you can take any one of a
bunch of different routers in a sis's
lineup and create your own Wi-Fi mesh
for excellent coverage across a very
large Dobis aisle I've just been looking
for an excuse to use the word domicile
I'm glad it presented itself
so one of the biggest problems with the
network setup here is that when James is
in law's got Internet service 17 years
ago the assumption was that only the
kids were gonna use it and they would
never give a rat's patoot about that
their newfangled Internet there and of
course we all know how that worked out
everybody uses the internet now so the
only place in the house that has coax
and the ethernet cables that they
actually ran themselves using the same
technique that I did like up the side of
the house to the study and then to one
of the upstairs bedrooms is here in the
basement where the kids were living all
those years ago so as you can imagine
this here yes combo modem router switch
access point thing provided by the ISP
just isn't gonna cut it okay so to show
one of the most problematic locations
I'm just gonna jump into bed with James
here this is a pretty realistic scenario
we're both gonna fire up a video to
watch on our computers and/or phones
okay so on James's phone he's actually
getting 1080p video but that's on 2.4
gigahertz Wi-Fi then on your laptop what
do you got nada and on my laptop I'm
watching this strange parts video on 5
gigahertz at a magnificent 360 P
resolution now that seems like it's kind
of working well enough you can have two
devices running up here and 2.4
gigahertz does have better range but
consider this there are many many
neighbors out this window here all of
whom are not at home right now because
it's whatever time it is I don't have my
watch on today if they were 2.4
gigahertz would have too much
interference and they've experienced
this in order to work reliably up here
and 5 gigahertz total mess from this
distance okay so here at location number
2 the hot tub my laptop is connected to
5 gigahertz and
can stream Netflix if you can call this
pixelated mess guardians of the galaxy -
I'm not sure that I would but James's
laptop also on 5g either can't see it at
all or when it can see it can't connect
to it now you might go ok well why don't
you guys just connect a 2.4 G and that's
sort of an option but if both of us were
connected to it at the same time and
heaven forbid the living room TV for
example was also running Netflix we
would quickly run out of bandwidth
because you got to remember 2.4
gigahertz does offer better range but it
doesn't support nearly the speeds of 5
gigahertz so if you want to be streaming
especially 4k content you want that 5g
network working so hot tub is another
fail for us now before we go any further
I do want to make it clear that in an
optimal world you just use a single
access point to cover everything because
then you don't have any issues when
you're roaming between access points and
the less complexity you can have in a
home network
generally speaking the better but if for
whatever reason that's not possible like
where we are today a mesh network can
help you out now ai mesh which is what
we're showing here is far from the only
mesh Wi-Fi solution in fact it's not
even the only one that asus has but
what's really cool about it is that what
Asus has done is on their newest models
they're really high-end stuff like the
ROG rapture all the way back to a
premium model from 2013 they're
providing this firmware update that lets
you upgrade your network while also
breathing new life into your older gear
and make a mesh network out of hardware
that was just already available out on
the market so they've got 16 different
models that are supported and these are
just three random ones that they sent us
to set things up here so we're gonna
throw this baby in bridge mode and we
are gonna turn off all of its wireless
functionality so that it doesn't
interfere with our good Wireless that we
are at ik this thing yeah and a headcrab
maybe
no not even a chuckle I want I wanted a
chuckle or like a open a web browser you
will be redirected to the AC setup
wizard if not navigate to router acecomm
okay I mean James I'm thinking placement
why is this goes pretty well with the
Live Love Laugh gamble right like I'm
just kind of okay so now that we've
reconfigured this all that's left to do
is check out this ball and friggin ROG
router interface I've never actually
seen that before and make sure the
internet is working all right now we
need to mesh it up it's amazing how much
of the tooling they reuse all right then
we're gonna stick with our theory that
staggering our routers is gonna be good
and we're gonna do the same thing
upstairs so now we're back at the front
of the house and we're just going to oh
I would hate to obstruct this beautiful
original stripe creep James you suck and
I'm gonna put this right here
okay so to get into AI mesh we go into
the network map and it says new feature
available now what we want to do is go
to here
hey I'm s combined more than one ACS
router to form an ami system yep yeah
got it got it
search for available AI mesh nodes
nearby to join your AI mesh system hey
there's one the AC 68 you so I think
that's the one upstairs and is it gonna
find the 86 you it does suggest putting
them right next to each other during
setup which we clearly didn't do or read
the instructions so we might have to go
get the AC 86 you but we'll see all
right here we go so we've got a
successful ad and a bunch of
instructions that might have been good
to look at before we positioned
everything high and open space between
your AI mesh router and your existing
dead zone
deputy blabbity yep that sounds good all
right let's search again and see if we
can pick up the other one it's cool that
you don't have I assumed we would have
to like plug Ethernet into those ones
and like configure them as nodes but
instead it just grabs their default SS
IDs and just finds them yeah that's
smart
actually okay this one is meshed so we
are all the way up in the upstairs
bedroom again let's go ahead and net
flix it up HD youtube it up how are you
doing not bad not bad at all
okay what resolution are you running at
though let's see 1080 on that one sure
hit it
and this Netflix stream looks not bad so
this is interesting James's
father-in-law came home while we were
working on this and said he's been
thinking of putting a TV out here by the
hot tub so because we're gonna have
amazing Wi-Fi signal strength let's go
ahead and I'm just gonna skip the part
of this that isn't buffered go ahead and
play that just like that Wow all we have
to do is run power to it and he'd be
able to get full quality 4k Netflix no
problem and with something like that TCL
TV that you actually did the review of
recently that whole thing could be done
pretty cheaply and that's still playing
really well too not bad so James is uh
James Wi-Fi on the gram not great not
something we should figure out how to
test in future notebook videos but uh as
for mine I'm on I'm on 5 gigahertz and
I'm skipping around in these videos like
nobody's business
crazy and we're at the furthest point on
the property now behind this trailer so
this is between us and that access point
in the window not bad
these rocks ow my soft youtuber feet ah
so that's it my work here is done
all that remains is to throw away the
garbage that we produced and OH
tell you guys about the opportunity of a
lifetime you too can own an AI mesh
compatible router from Asus just by
checking out the link in the video
description you've got to make a 15 to
30 second video talking about how bad
your internet solution is and three
lucky winners of three not six sorry
three lucky winners will get their very
own AI mesh router the contest closes
seven days after this video airs so go
check it out and write like and dislike
and buy the stuff we featured in video
