videoblog Mountain I've had a lot of
Christmas to credit kritis pretty
criticism that I don't know what I'm
doing and Windows Phone 8 and this much
has been true especially up till now
because I haven't known what I was doing
which is the point of this video blog
however in the last couple of weeks I
have picked up an awful lot of cool
stuff that I'm going to show you guys
some of which is to do with new things I
found that I like or dislike and some of
which is to do with things that I've
discovered that are actually way better
than I thought so why don't we start
with the fantastic copy-paste so if I
were to look for say for example sha
phone number this has to be just the
super most elegant issed
copy-paste that i have ever seen so
here's that contextual search so
hopefully this is going to search web
yeah there it goes sha slash contact us
and all I gotta do is find a phone
number touch it okay well it didn't pick
it up that time but check this out any
time you highlight something there's a
little copy next time you go to a text
box it'll just be sitting there ready
for you to go ahead and paste it so I
love the way it does copy paste another
thing I discovered is the it's that
Windows Phone jumps very cleanly between
Wi-Fi and cellular data so you know how
it has that feature where it scans for
wireless hotspots around you that's cool
it's also kind of annoying because as
you're driving around there'll be little
notifications coming up hot spot hot
spot hot spot well they're all protected
you can't use them however what I
noticed is that even compared to iOS and
Android there was a power outage and in
our studio and Slick's phone he couldn't
load up a page mine did and I was like
ah but I'm connected to Wi-Fi Windows
Phone 8 automatically figures out oh
well it's not working so why don't I
just use cellular yay I personally think
that's awesome cuz it's so annoying when
you have a flaky Wi-Fi connection that
you're connected to but it's too flaky
to actually load a page and it just
gives up forever
it's friggin annoying so it actually
find
a little bit page with I think is
absolutely great oh yeah so for those of
you who were criticizing me for not
finding the multitasking interface
you're right I didn't I did not find the
back button to use the multitasking
interface that intuitive I also still
don't really like it because the way
that see how do you see how smooth the
slide is you can't actually click
anything until it's stopped so that
makes it a little bit challenging for me
personally to quickly navigate to
something that I'm looking for because
you have to kind of stop it stop stop
and then you're actually able to
navigate to something within the
multitasking interface but it's a lot
better than what I thought it was which
was just press the windows key and have
everything closed on you so there you go
I probably could have figured this out
if I'd noticed the notification that
comes up the first time you turn on the
phone that sends you to the windows site
with some helpful tips and tricks did
not see that for those of you who said
my cloud media app is probably only not
working correctly resuming the playback
because I wasn't using multitasking it
looks like that's not quite the case
even if you skip and cloud media I've
decided is an acceptable substitute for
for air video it's not perfect and
because I mean it doesn't resume and and
all that kind of stuff but it's sort of
it's getting me by so check this out if
I multitask and go somewhere else let's
go back to Shaw tech support
then we multitask back to a show it is
going to press play even though it knows
where it is
it is going to take me back to the
beginning of the show so this is
probably just a bug within the oh and of
course the one time that I'm trying to
prove a point here it doesn't do that so
there you go trust me guys usually when
I wait a bit go do a few things and then
go back to it it doesn't it doesn't work
it just goes right back to the beginning
of the show so oh oh the stock Twitter
holy crap I don't even know if it's
still on my phone but I mean you got
people complaining that there's no
native Facebook app but quite frankly if
the native Facebook app ends up anywhere
near as bad as the stock Twitter app
then yeah I don't think we're really
missing anything so here check this out
okay I want to reply to everyone here Oh
replies to no okay reply no oh they're
all gone okay how do I reply to all okay
hashtags what I can't even reply all
it's freaking ridiculous however I had I
had viewers point out this particular
app which is called oh yeah this was
another thing that was pointed out to me
as well is that if you click on
something and expand it you can see what
it's called then you can put it back if
you don't remember for whatever reason
you go back so rally is awesome this is
probably the best Twitter app that I've
yet encountered it's extremely clean
it looks very Windows 8 UI gorgeous it
Scrolls well it's uh it's very very
elegant in terms of new tweets
integrating pictures you can sort of
pick whatever pictures you want you can
basically you can just do all the stuff
that you should be able to do in a
Twitter app very very easily I really
really like it so that's all from
January 24th this is going to end up
being a long video Xbox music on the
desktop I wasn't able to use I had
someone suggest to me that I use that so
don't have Windows 8 yet however the the
subscription is kind of awesome you just
basically go to the Xbox music store
it's a hundred bucks a year you go okay
top albums I want to listen to some
Justin Bieber I can either download it
or just stream it
and there you go just like that so it's
extremely fast it's not something I had
pre cached on my phone let me tell you
that much
tanzie was suggested to transfer SMS but
it's 20 bucks so I didn't bother I just
decided you know what I'm gonna live
without my old sms's plugging into the
headphone jack on this particular phone
makes a bit of a staticky noise so I'm
plugging and plugging it causes a little
bit of interference I found it kind of
annoying but it's not a huge deal it's
just something I wasn't really used to
Beats Audio needs to be off I think I
mentioned that last time for me to enjoy
it because I find it boosts up the bass
too much so that's January 26th let's
move on to January 28th SkyDrive
integration is awesome I actually tried
to do a so it syncs all your photos
automatically which is great because you
just sit down at any other computer
where you have SkyDrive hooked up and
they're just all kind of there as soon
as it's anywhere near Wi-Fi it'll upload
very very cool and this is amazing so
the way oh wait now I'm not moving on to
that yet sorry sorry sorry not that so
yeah convenient not to have to worry
about syncing things that syncs your app
list as well as your photos your
documents and pretty much whatever else
you want your settings all that good
stuff
um Nokia Drive Nokia Drive I wanted to
use it on the 28th but I discovered that
you can't hold on no no that's gonna
have my my GPS for where I am right now
which is not optimal but Nokia Drive
doesn't allow you to download maps for a
location where it's prolonged I'm just
gonna go like somewhere else yeah let's
look in the middle of the countryside so
check this out it doesn't allow you to
download maps when you're on 3G even
though the files aren't that big and you
can say yeah no I really do want it it's
okay it won't let you do it
but I love the fact that you're
downloading maps offline and you're able
to use your GPS even if you have no data
connection phenomenal absolutely awesome
and the way the navigation works in this
app the turn-by-turn is outstanding I
absolutely love it so there you go
January 29th music and contacts
navigation I had complained that when I
go to my music library so my collection
I said I had to scroll down like this I
was wrong all you have to do is click
any one of these letters and then you
can navigate
directly to artists or albums or songs
or whatever else starting with that
letter and that is the quick navigation
I personally don't find this quite as
fast because it's two clicks as just
having a scroll here but this is way
better than what I thought it was and
honestly it's it's fine as far as quick
navigation goes sort of thumb thumbs up
maybe just like one and a half thumbs up
you can swipe notifications away to the
right so notifications that come down on
the top I had said you can't get rid of
them you swipe them to the right I'm
sorry guys this wasn't intuitive to me
as a Windows user I'm used to something
comes up I click somewhere else to make
that other thing go away so this was a
new sort of UI thing for me I missed it
but there you go you can get rid of them
quickly if you need to there's an app
for matt bonner during battery I think
this is a clergy solution because you
can see here there's no percentage you
can't turn that on you have to actually
get a separate app to tell you what your
battery life percentage is that it also
gives you some neat tips about how to
you know preserve more battery life
suggest things like turning off NFC
which can be a bit of a battery hog you
know closing apps rather than leaving
them running in the background so cool
little stuff like that but this isn't
useful for when I'm in a browser say for
example and I want to know what my
battery life is oh how do I do that
oh I can't even see the bar now so yeah
it's it's not perfect still but it's
better than I thought because at least
you can get an app that tells you the
percentage I said Robbie's ah the People
Hub so I've spent more time with people
now actually I'm a shut-in I spent no
time with people but I spent more time
with the people app no this is the me
app that's a different one there it is
people so people's cool because it's
great for monitoring other people
however what I've noticed about it is
that it's not okay so together those
four groups it's really not that great
for communicating with other people so
if I go oh if I create like a great
contact no where is it Twitter I don't
know show updates yeah so it's great for
monitoring then you go to the me one and
I don't think these should be two
separate apps so look at this I just
want to post an update I want to post a
Twitter but how do I had a photo to it
okay maybe you can do it maybe I'm just
totally
but come on what why is this hard I very
much prefer rally and yeah I'm mostly a
Twitter guy that's um one thing I wanted
to mention on January 29th as well is I
don't miss Facebook at all actually I
totally don't miss having Facebook on my
phone because the things I care about
with Facebook things like being able to
message someone are integrated into
either people or my messaging
application hold on let me just make
sure there's nothing there
or my messaging application here which
is okay you guys will just have to take
my word for it
let me just find someone there we go oh
I don't have diesel on Facebook do I
have the crazy Russian on Facebook I
don't have the crazy Russian on Facebook
well okay between the people app and the
messaging app you can message someone
pretty much any way you'd want without
an official Facebook app so like I said
I actually just totally don't miss it
and then people allows you to monitor
people's Facebook updates anyway so yeah
moving right along
we'll just see if we missed anything
windowsphone.com freaking awesome so
there are some pretty cool features
there you can ring lock track erase
install apps and you can do a full wipe
of the phone from windowsphone.com which
is pretty freaking cool did you zoom in
on that okay that's probably just as
well because my phone numbers on there
but the point is that you can see where
your phone is you can ring it so you can
find it if it's under something you can
even set your phone within the Find My
Phone app itself which we're gonna just
go find so you go to settings settings
do-do-do-do-do find my phone check it
out so you can tell it hey save my
phone's location periodically and before
the battery runs out send apps to my
phone using push notifications not SMS
very very cool stuff and I mean those
are huge features if you're using this
for like for work or anything like that
although I did found one kind of neat
flaw because I had thrown my sin in an
HTC 8s and done a full migration so I
did a backup and restore the backup is
completely automatic I didn't have
do anything to do it all you have to do
is put the sim in a new car in a new
phone boot it up log in and say hey I
want to restore from that phone and it
does everything even even now like it's
getting all of my text messages and
install on my apps it does everything
but arrange your live tiles which is
very very cool so I could go sim out sim
in and this phone would be as up-to-date
as this one even all my text messages
are syncing on the fly now that this
phone is logged into my SkyDrive account
so I absolutely love that it's very
smooth compared to the iOS way okay
obviously it doesn't do all your music
and media but you can copy that manually
because all you got to do is plug in a
USB cable yay
compared to iTunes so way way more
elegant as an iOS user though I'm
finding I'm finding persistent soft
buttons down here a real problem because
sometimes my leg through the pocket will
press a button when I have like a video
playing and then I have an earbud in or
something like a YouTube music video or
something I'm listening to it'll press
stuff and then it'll go places and I'm
finding that sort of disruptive overall
I mean I like having hard buttons here
but I could probably get used to it in
time what I'm doing right now is I'm
turning it around in my pocket so that
it doesn't bump stuff but it's just it's
kind of a cloudy solution we're moving
on to January 31st within the settings
things are linked in multiple places I
really like this so back to settings so
you don't have to fuss around trying to
figure out sort of what logic was used
by whoever set it up so for example SMS
is under both backup and messaging so if
you go back up so you can have all of
your text messaging settings there so
you can click that to go into it in more
detail or you can see it within ah this
I love okay I actually had a pocket PC
back when those were cool and why
doesn't iOS implement this snooze why
can't you snooze a notification on iOS
that's awesome remind me in 10 minutes
freaking amazing like what I want to go
back into my calendar and like Rica
jigger it for 10 minutes from now
because I don't have time right no no I
want to snooze it's awesome love it so I
set that up so that I could show you
guys that
but it kind of surprised me soon I
forget where I was the thing about the
browser if I had to complain about
anything it's snappy it Scrolls quickly
it's responsive but it's two touches to
get to my tabs I wish it was one touch
to select tabs it's a minor thing I
don't use tabbed browsing that much on
my phone but there you go
copy/paste is outstanding yeah I already
talked about that everything huh
everything that's been driving me crazy
about the 8x keyboard it turns out is
purely a form factor thing because I
tried using the 8's for a day and that
fixed every complaint I had about it so
you can see with the size of my hand
this is a reach for me I can barely make
it over see I press the Search button
trying to make it over to here which is
where the keyboard would be annoying
with the 8's on the other hand I can
easily and comfortably type no matter
what and I don't have to you know I
recommend it it's fine I didn't use it
much so I can just go yeah hello this is
Q and I won't press the Search button so
I thought that the keyboard was just
kind of difficult for me to use it's
nothing to do with the keyboard
keyboards fine it's just the 8x is a
little bit too big for my hands and for
those of you who are gonna say who use
the note 2
no I'm not gonna use a no - it's too big
this is too big I have small hands who
you'll get used to no you won't your
small ants don't grow because your phone
is bigger yeah yeah so I'm a stick I'm a
actually ok this is sort of a spoiler
alert but I'm only gonna do one more
update at day 30 I may actually end up
sticking with Windows Phone but I
probably won't stick with the 8x if I
can figure out a way to get all of my
apps in the 4 gigs of the 8's I may
actually just go that route because the
form factors just who's I wish that
there were still compact high-end phones
but it seems like screen size has become
the new sort of you know appendage
measuring contest
so whatever the email app destroys the
built-in one for iOS I love the email
app it is just awesome you can see your
flag messages your urgent ones I'm
I don't need to look too closely but
just the way it does it the way it does
attachments is awesome in iOS you have
to go browse to your photo then you have
to go send this to someone no no no no
not not in Windows so here let's send
let's send an email to slick oh nope
hold on here so I'm just gonna kind of
cover this up but the point is you want
to send an attachment you click the
attachment button oh yeah that's simple
then you go find an attachment that's
like her door here's a picture of you
and it's and it's done I I love it it's
just really elegant it's quick and it's
quick to search the server so if it
doesn't find anything that's just a
button yet search the server and it
doesn't take forever which on iOS it
does for some I just stopped using the
iOS one I just use the Gmail
browser-based mobile site because the
app is terrible whereas on this one I've
stopped using the mobile site entirely
the app is much better emailing photos
easy a February 1st the people app can
be manually over I yes the people app so
the people app has some really good
things about it but here I'm just gonna
find this is just kind of funny so we're
gonna go down to Jay where I have here
we go so you know what that should be
fine I have three Jack Chin's actually I
know to jack chins and one of these Jack
Chin's hair just don't want to show
anyone's phone yeah there we go so see
this shows a yahoo and a Pivo spun and
it has combined multiple yeah I see
here's more and an Nvidia one so it's
got three different ones for what are
two Jack Chen's who work for two
different companies you can override it
though so it's not the end of the world
and then there were some individual
people that were split out into multiple
ones but all you have to do is use a
setting that says link so you can unlink
and then you can link additional ones
together and it'll just take your entire
disorganized contact list so you've got
some of them in your hotmail contacts
your gmail contacts your whatever
contacts it is kind of goes and it puts
them all together Facebook Linkedin all
that stuff so yeah manual overriding is
good Howe error codes
this is this is hilarious so there was
some app that couldn't install on here
we go this particular phone when it
tried to do the synchronization so I was
like click I clicked on I was like
attention required tap here error
message hold on
the error code eight zero zero ffff
come on Microsoft come on guys I mean
this is like when you know Backman and
the send messenger was the big deal and
you'd like get this error code you'd be
like what does that mean you try to
google it you couldn't find anything
because your internet wasn't working
turns out the error code meant your
Internet's not connected and you're just
like why didn't you just say my
Internet's not connected there you go
there's a friggin concept for you so
yeah just there's those little Microsoft
things uh-oh I found a bit of a glitch
the backup/restore process doesn't work
if you don't have a data connection
through your cellular provider so it
doesn't give you an option to connect to
Wi-Fi to do a restore and phone
ownership transfer so that's just
bizarre
and you can only switch a profile from
one phone to another one upon initial
boot up you have to wipe and restore a
phone in order to take your profile and
transfer the entire thing so if you have
no sim in there with no data connection
you cannot do it and I did Google that
it's like a true thing oh the to-do list
I love the to-do list its integrated
really well with the calendar so you
just swipe over to to-do list and you're
gonna have a bunch of no no it's okay
you're gonna have a bunch of to do stuff
so you can see your day agenda your
agenda and your to-do list and it's
really really smooth I think that's
about it thank you for checking out this
extremely long and hopefully interesting
video about my two weeks into the
Windows Phone 8 experience where I'm
actually finding you know I got my sound
town now I got metro tube which is an
awesome YouTube app I'm not really
missing this thing anymore so that's
exciting don't forget to subscribe -
