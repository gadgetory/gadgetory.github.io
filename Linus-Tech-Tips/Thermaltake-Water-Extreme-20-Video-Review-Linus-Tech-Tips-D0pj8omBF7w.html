welcome to Linus tech tips today's video
is our video review of the water 2.0
Xtreme now I want to spend a little bit
of time explaining our testing
methodology before we go any further
all coolers we test are inside a closed
case this is a corsair c70 we also
collect our ambient temperatures at the
time of monitoring any cpu temperatures
and then we offset and correct
everything to a 20 degree Celsius room
temperature we never use the fans
included with a cooler because the way
we see it there's a couple of different
ways to evaluate these coolers number
one is with the included kit which is
what everybody else is doing and it
gives you a certain amount of
information but not necessarily the
story about the cooler itself because it
throws an additional variable in so
you've got sound as a variable no
pressure as a variable CFM as a variable
and the cooler itself as a very good to
many variables you can't tell what's
going on so we have standardized our
testbench
on only n FF 12 and NF a 14 FLX fans
from Noctua these are pressure optimized
fans and will actually give every cooler
available to us the opportunity to
perform its best so the water 2.0 uses
quarter inch tubing it uses an ASA tech
platform so you've probably seen this
mounting hardware before but what makes
this guy unique is it's thicker than
normal radiator so you can see that most
radiators are actually about the same
thickness as a fan whereas this one adds
probably another 20-30 percent to the
thickness that contributes a real-world
performance difference to the water 2.0
compared to it's a lower performing dual
120 millimeter brethren now how much of
the difference you might ask well here
let's that's oh yeah the system right so
the system inside here is a 3930k that
is overclocked so it's a 6
or processor we keep a GTX 580 in here
and we run fur mark when we're doing our
load tests just to let you are a
combustor rather that's kind of the same
thing but we run combustor just so that
the system is generating what would be
sort of an unrealistically high but but
in what an extreme use case scenario
load and then we always use our single
120 millimeter exhaust and the two 120
millimeter intakes that are right here
stock on the C 70 we have created this
test bench because it represents what we
consider to be an optimally cooled and
still very quiet gaming system well
that's what I think anyway
slick thinks it could be louder but I
don't so whatever alright so let's move
on to performance we take idle
performance at the desktop we let it
heat up and achieve equilibrium then we
take load performance with prime95 small
FFT running must be 12 right yeah 12
threads on that CPU and combustor
running in the background so here we go
water 2.0 extreme so here are these are
the two columns that you guys want to
look at right here and you can check the
the link to this graph in the video
description but the water 2.0 extreme
beats out the h1 10 even so remember
guys cooling is all about surface area
however it should be noted this is sort
of within margin of error like we can
safely call that pretty much a tie but
the h1 10 and the water 2.0 extreme come
out ahead of everything else
our Kraken we think there must be
something wrong with it so we're going
to try and get our hands on another one
because it should perform pretty much
the same as the h1 10 okay so why does
the water 2.0 extreme perform the same
as a 2 by 140 millimeter cooler which
has more surface area because of the
larger fan simple answer because we're
using pressure optimized fans which we
do for all of our test benches that
means that adding thickness to the
radiator doesn't hurt as much as it does
if you're not using pressure optimized
fans so that means adding an extra 20 to
30% of thickness gives us the same
effect as adding an extra 20 to 30% of
wideness so there you go thank you for
