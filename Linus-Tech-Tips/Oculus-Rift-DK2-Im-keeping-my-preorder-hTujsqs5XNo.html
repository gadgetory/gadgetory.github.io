2014 is brought to you by Intel and
Corsair
alright guys we here at oculus rift at
PAX East you all moose was coming I held
myself off as long as I could but it is
now day two and I couldn't stay away any
longer I got to try out their couch
nights demo which was really good it was
really fun to play any comparison to
make during this video we'll be
comparing to a development kit one not
the HD prototype or the crystal pro
prototype development kit one to see you
guys know right off the bat the pixel
grid is still noticeable at 1080p but we
kind of expected that it is a lot easier
to look past though than it was on
development kit one you could look past
it on development kit one but it still
always looks like you're looking through
a screen door this one you notice the
pixels at first but once you get engaged
with the game they kind of disappear and
it's not actually too bad although I am
still definitely excited for kind of 4k
screens or two and half days screens in
these VR devices the other most
noticeable thing when you actually start
playing with it is presents when you
lean forward or if you move your head
forward or you till your head side to
side or any of that kind of stuff it
actually reacts to that due to the
tracking IR LEDs any external camera
that they have now set up and that feels
great and it feels natural and it really
makes you feel like you're actually in
the game despite sitting on a couch
playing with nights that are on the
table which is not happening in reality
but it still actually is a lot more
engaging and really increases the
presence that you feel within maybe our
environment another interesting question
I had was about the external camera that
we first saw introduced on the crystal
code prototype and is now on DK 2 or
this guy right here the external camera
which I can't show you right now is
tracking IR LEDs that are built into the
front of the development kit too and if
you were to play something like a
Valkyrie and tried to do a back flip so
you lean too far backwards and
essentially took the headset like this
how's the tracking IR LEDs going to work
if the camera can't see them properly
and if you were someone who bought an
omni or has an omni already or is
getting one in the future how is that
going to work because if the tracking
camera is set up at one fixed position
and you turn around so you're not facing
him anymore
and the head sets like this to the
camera that's going to be a serious
problem and the answer to that was that
they're targeting a seated position they
have to be able to conquer
what's on the table now before they move
forward and what's on the table now is a
seated position so hopefully in the
future you can do stuff like holodecks
while you're running around
jumping over things and you could stand
and you can crouch and you could crawl
and you can do all that kind of stuff
but for now the oculus experience is
going to be seated
so if you're someone that's getting an
ami or someone that plans to be flipping
around or mobile with the oculus that's
not actually the experience they're
targeting right now so just a heads up
all right guys so I think the conclusion
of this is that I'm not canceling my dk2
order if you will let me know let me
know in the comments below let me know
in the forum let me know on Twitter at
slick PC I want to know what you guys
think about this demo we showed you as
much as we could now other than
strapping the camera into an oculus rift
cuz that would not work very well but oh
well I had a great time it looks great
the presence of being up leaned forward
and backward is great low persistence on
the oil ad panel is awesome I got to
experience that as well and the fast 75
Hertz refresh rate is also great so let
me know what you think about all those
things in the same areas I told you
