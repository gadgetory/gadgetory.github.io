I saw that Apple had updated the iMac I
didn't really think about it twice I
mean it's just a refresh and they didn't
make a bunch of noise about it but then
I saw that it came with up to a core I
nine eight core processor at that point
I had all kinds of questions like how
the heck are they gonna cool one of
these in a standard iMac does this make
the iMac Pro basically pointless and how
quickly can we get one well let's answer
that last one first it takes about a
week as for the rest of it stay tuned
because we are about to find out the hot
docs uses the Ergo Docs design which
keeps you comfortable typing away for
long periods of time and features qmk
firmware and hot swappable key switches
check it out at the link below
within its iconic trapezoidal box and
sandwiched between three pieces of
protective styrofoam we find the beast
with its glossy 27-inch 5k Retina
display front and center I've got a
praise Apple for their multiple layers
of protection to ensure that your iMac
reaches your desk without any scratches
or scuffs but I do think that there's
room to improve on the amount of non
recyclable material that they use for
packing the same can also be said for
the i/o it's mostly great actually we've
got two Thunderbolt three ports and more
than enough type-a super speed USB s for
the average desktop especially when you
consider that Wi-Fi is integrated and
the magic keyboard and Magic Mouse need
to be charged so infrequently that they
can share a cable but dang it Apple if
we're gonna shower you with praise for
including 10 gig Ethernet on the iMac
Pro and the Mac Mini then you have got
to expect the opposite when you don't do
it it's not even an option here which is
a real shame because you're stuck either
accepting 2005 level network speeds or
shelling out several hundred dollars for
a Thunderbolt 2 10 gig Ethernet adapter
as for the rest of the design
Apple has taken the if it ain't broke
don't fix it approach remaining
fundamentally unchanged since 2009 in
fairness it's somehow still looks pretty
sexy but the bezels and especially the
chin bar are just massive for a modern
machine and we feel like even timeless
designs do need to be refreshed once in
a while that said the 2019 iMac does
have one welcome remnant of that bygone
era
user expansion apples still rocking it
with four easily accessible ddr4 sodium
slots which means unlike Anthony when he
purchased this machine for a review you
can skip the Apple tax and install your
own memory to not only save yourself a
little cash but to push your system RAM
capacity to a staggering 128 gigs that's
double what Apple has available on their
store for about the same price so Apple
I don't want to beg it's not dignified
but I will whatever the next iMac looks
like please don't take this away from us
between this iMac and the Mac Mini
you've shown us that there are still
some people there who care it's not too
late to change enough about the future
though let's take a look at the machine
we had today
so we kidded ours with the top-end kora
999 hundred K F and that F means that it
omits the Intel HD graphics that
typically come along for the ride in
consumer chips in favor of slightly
improved thermals unfortunately while
our unit also has dedicated graphics we
opted for the Radeon Pro rx5 ATX
figuring that if we needed a lot more
horsepower we could get more with our
Radeon seven in an external enclosure no
onboard GPU means that Intel's Quick
Sync video encoding is out of the
question here it's a good thing that
Apple is big on OpenCL so onto our
performance analysis then we're gonna
focus mainly on the IMAX CPU performance
with emphasis on how well Apple managed
to cool our beastly eight core
hyper-threaded CPU if they managed it at
all and actually it keeps our core I 9
going over even long workloads with core
temperatures hovering around the low to
mid 92 greem Arc now to be clear that's
higher than what I'd be comfortable with
and that's especially true once there's
some dust in the cooler a couple of
years later but it's actually better
than I expected and if like us you have
concerns about the long-term health of
any machine that's running hot enough to
cook instant noodles you can use a piece
of free software called max fan control
to bump up your fan speed so then at
full our temperatures looked a lot more
sane without our machine becoming
unreasonably loud
but not all of the news here is good or
even necessarily bad some of it's just
kind of weird
while our CPU frequency is constant
which would indicate that we're not
throttling let's just overlay the base
clock on this graph and ooh if we're a
little off there aren't we let's zoom
right in on the first minute of the
temperature and CPU speed grass and
that's weird too it's not even thermal
throttling so it kind of smells like a
power limit issue sure enough then if we
look at the package power using Intel's
power gadget we're actually running at
around 80 watts sustained instead of the
95 that they rate this chip for now it's
unclear whether this is a deliberate
measure to protect constrained VRMs or
if it's because of a firmware bug but
what we do know is how it impacts
performance so in some of our tests we
got similar performance to our
comparison 9900 Kay but heavier loads
like Cinebench revealed the 6%
difference that we would expect from
lower clock speeds so it looks like
Apple managed to tame the beast but they
only did it by removing some of its
venom which is sort of cheating we did
find outliers the other way though this
is really interesting
so in this blender render we managed
higher performance than our reference
comparison CPU this one took us a little
while but here's what happened
remember that controversy over
motherboard manufacturers basically
factory overclocking Intel CPUs by
removing some of Intel's recommended
constraints well around that time we
switched to running all of our
benchmarks at Intel recommended turbo
boost settings which is something that
we can't manually control on the iMac so
then it looks like what Apple has done
is played around with the turbo clock
speed dials a little bit provided that
the chip does not exceed their power
limit which actually resulted
a continuous boost clock speed of 3.8
gigahertz in this test as a sanity check
we ran our comparison 9900 K with its
limiter disabled and a beefy cooler and
it performed better still so now you
know which leads us then to the price
it's actually pretty reasonable compared
to building your own comparable desktop
setup with the same features this is
something we've talked about before and
it's happening again if you want that
hardware max were generally expensive so
the question then becomes should you buy
one at 2700 US dollars for the core i9
version you're looking at someone who
needs the hyper thread performance of
the kora 999 hundred K as well as
excellent if not the best multi-threaded
performance 8 course really is a nice
sweet spot and an excellent 5k display
so we're looking at photographers video
editors and other visual media
professionals looks like they kind of
nailed it in fact ironically in some
ways they nailed it a little too hard
because it's actually a better machine
for a lot of those users than the iMac
Pro and that computer is nearly twice
the price so that if you're one of those
people who needs that magic blend of
performance and dorm friendly form
factor you really can't go wrong unless
paying for computers that don't perform
quite as the specs indicate and come
with a mouse that you can't use while
you charge it just straight up rubs you
the wrong way
you know it rubs me the right way though
our sponsor for today's video
ting is the mobile carrier that's
focused on customer service and customer
satisfaction
they've even got real people working at
their customer service center and not
robots you pay only for what you use
with the average ting bill coming to
just twenty three bucks a month per
device if you're stuck in a contract and
switch to ting they'll cover 25% of your
cancellation fee up to $75 they've got
lower mobile data rates than ever just
$10 per gig beyond the second gig and
every single ting customer can reap the
benefits of changes like that one so
head over to Linus ENCOM to try out
their savings calculator we used their
voicemail to text service and published
our number one eight three three five
six five
LT TV m to hear some messages from our
fans did we now I unfortunately don't
have access to think here in the UK but
I would love to get it would save me
roughly around about ten pounds if you
were to convert it so I really hope
you're able to come over here into the
UK so don't lower your phone bill at
Linus ENCOM and get twenty five bucks in
ting reddit or off a new phone in the
ting shop we'll have that linked below
so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucks you know what to do but if
it was awesome hit that like button get
