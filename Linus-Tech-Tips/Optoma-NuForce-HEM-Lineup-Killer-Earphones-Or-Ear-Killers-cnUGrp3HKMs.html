on a new product from new force or for
products rather it's an entire lineup of
balanced armature driver in ear monitors
or IEMs the AGM two four six and eight
and they've got a rather unique drop
running on them where you pay less than
the retail price of the least expensive
unit with a fifty percent chance of
getting one of the higher tier ones they
reached out to me to ask for a review of
the lineup so this will be a couple of
firsts for me I've never actually
formally reviewed a multi balanced
armature IEM and at least I don't
remember ever trying to make a video
about four products in the same family
all at the same time so wish me luck
cooller masters new master keys Pro L
and Pro s keyboards provide sixteen
point seven million color RGB
backlighting genuine Cherry MX switches
and an industry-leading ARM Cortex
processor learn more the link in the
video description let's begin with
everything these four products have in
common the accessory package is nearly
identical across the board and pretty
darn impressive I might add everything
comes packed in an air and watertight
polycarbonate case that while I
personally wished was smaller to hold
only the accessory I'm actually likely
to carry around with me
others will likely prefer the larger
size so they can chuck some other
valuables in while they're kayaking or
whatever it is that cool people do on
the weekends inside that is more goodies
the smaller carrying case I asked for
though not waterproof this time a full
complement of ear tips small medium and
large silicone and medium and large
comply 100 foam ear tips I can't use
them because my ear canals are too small
but they're a nice bonus if yours aren't
the last couple of accessories are a
braided ofc copper apparently there's
silver in it too or something like that
cable without a microphone and a second
cable with a microphone both offer
decent if unexceptional tangle
resistance and the braided one looks
admittedly pretty cool one thing to
watch out for here though is make sure
you plug your cable into the I am really
firmly to engage the lock I made that
mistake a couple of times the last thing
that's similar across the board is the
outer design of the housing they get
heavier as you move up to the more
premium products but they all feel very
similar in the ear which is a really
good thing because IMO NuForce nailed
the comfort of these they seal really
well and offer noticeably better noise
isolation than my daily driver ie 80s
although it should be noted that they
don't transport you into a completely
other world like the etymology r4 series
and they were comfortable even while
lying down on my side a critical factor
if you're like me and you sleep with
your IMS in so with that out of the way
let's start at the bottom of the product
stack the ATM twos with their single
balanced armor
design deliver a pretty clear analytical
high-end with one-dimensional though
thankfully fairly punchy bass I did find
them a little fatiguing to listen to as
I prefer a more veiled high-end my
closest point of comparison to these
sorry my earphone stable is a little
limited is my hundred dollars sure se215
s by comparison those sounded boo me
with uncontrolled bass and made
lyricists sound like they were singing
through a blanket but at least they
allowed me to hear the hum background
vocalists in better when I'm dancing by
Meghan Trainor I could hardly even tell
they were singing different notes with
the ATM twos at double the price for
improved comfort a better accessory
package and pretty much a textbook
comparison between the trade-offs that
you make between dynamic drivers and
balanced armature drivers
I guess the choice is yours but I
personally go for the better sounding
dynamic drivers let's step up to the 300
dollar dual balanced armature ATM force
these are very very dangerous waters at
the exact same price as my daily driver
Sennheiser ie 80s these had better
deliver in spades and while they carry
forward the lyrical strength not to
mention the sparkly and for me slightly
fatiguing highs of their little brother
and add a much more expressive if a
touch loose low-end where they fall flat
for me is in anything anthemic roar by
Katy Perry and marry you by Bruno Mars
being solid examples they bring the
vocalist forward in a way that makes it
feel like the background music his
de-emphasize it's as though the singer
is being beamed directly into my ear
canals and it's I don't like it's hard
to put my finger on it it's like the
background music is out of focus I mean
don't get me wrong you want to listen to
vocalists like Linda Ronstadt all day
the HM force will really impress you and
I'll likely end up popping them in from
time to time they just don't work as an
all-rounder for me which is not my final
word on the HTM lineup with the HTM 6
you move from a dual to a triple
balanced armature design and a fuller
more notch
sound while I prefer the rumble of my ie
80s in a song like Zane's recent hit
pillow-talk the ATM 6 delivers
controlled blows and carries forward
much of the vocal clarity of the HTM 4s
and twos without the fatiguing sparkly
highs and that uncanny sensation that I
got in some songs from the lower-end
models they're actually very pleasing to
listen to so while I don't think the HTM
sixes are going to rock the skulls of
the edn and bass head folks out there
for pop rock alternative and well I mean
most of what the mainstream is going to
be listening to these are tuned really
well at the price if all I was getting
was the headphone and a cable I would
still have a hard time recommending them
but given that I caved a couple weeks
ago and paid $70 with shipping for a
first-party microphone cable for my IE
80s after wasting $20 on a crappy
third-party one that was obscenely
uncomfortable boom there goes the
pricing advantage and the two carrying
cases are a much much better solution
than the cumbersome one that son Heiser
includes with the IE 80 I guess you
could interpret that as a recommendation
so then the HTM a should be a foregone
conclusion right the eight out of eight
rating joke is begging to be made here
and I'd have done it for sure only the
HNH really didn't impress me from the
moment I put them in my ears vocals
sounded obscured by a base ear more beat
generation sound signature that just
wasn't present in any of the other skews
to be clear some people will really like
them I'm just not one of them it was
suggested to me by my master op contact
that I might like them better after
giving the whopping four balanced
armature drivers in the HTM 8 sometime
to burn in so I left them running in a
corner of my office overnight and came
back to them any difference the burnin
period might have made must have been
too subtle for my ears to pick up on the
bass line in do I have to say the words
by Brian Adams still dominates the song
in a way that it doesn't with anything
else in the testing lineup today given
the choice between the HTM 6 and the 8
even at the same price I would take the
AGM 6
which I guess leads us then to the
ultimate conclusion having never looked
at anything from the NuForce lineup
before the package comfort and
construction quality really impressed me
and while I wish the sound signature was
a little more unified across a product
family that bears the same name I
understand that from a1 to a4 balanced
armature design that's a difficult thing
to do and I think that the HTM 4 and the
6 are the strongest of the 4 offerings
especially given their price points
