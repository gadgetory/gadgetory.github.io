the silverstone Tenjin series TJ 10 the
perfect combination of legendary styling
and advanced chassis engineering now
this isn't the newest case in the world
but I needed this for a particular build
that I wanted to do and it is still one
of my favorite cases ever although it's
not quite my favorite case the
silverstone TJ o7 holds that crown and I
guess I'm starting to sound like a bit
of a Silverstone fanboy over here but I
do like metal aluminum cases I do like
large cases and Silverstone does make
those things so let's go ahead and is
over
oh man it's I mean okay it's light
compared to a steel chassis but it's
heavy compared to some of the more
recent silver stone creations we've
checked out like the FTO three mini so
let's go ahead and have a look at what
Silverstone has to say for itself
premium all aluminum chassis for
extended ATX ATX and SSI motherboards
120 millimeters only so that was back
120 millimeter fans were a big deal
unprecedented air duct dedicated that'll
show you advanced structural engineering
okay you know what let's just put this
down and have a look I just hit the mic
okay let me fix that okay so let's go
ahead and open up the case so the first
thing we find is closed cell foam love
to see that a good two inches of closed
cell foam around the sides of the case
and then about an inch and a half on
either end and then up at the top you
can see Silverstone custom builds their
foam so yeah your case will not get
damaged even if it has a fully fledged
liquid cooling system inside it love to
see that attention to detail because
there are system builders that do
integrate in these things so they will
ship it in the original shipping box
alright next up we've got all the little
accessories and whatnots that you may or
may not need to put your system together
and we've got a destroyed box trying to
get it open there we go so
working out pretty well for me so in
here we find a piece that it never used
to come with before that looks like I
have no idea okay
figure that out later and then we've got
all the mounting hardware we need for
drives and motherboard tray and all that
good stuff and finally a manual that
probably says something about that other
thing but I don't know I've built in the
TJ ten a number of times but not not for
a while so I like I said I don't
recognize that part and I've actually
built in its predecessor the TJ O nine a
number of times as well the only real
difference between the TJ o 9 and the TJ
10 is this front door that's here on the
TJ 10 and is not here on the TJ o nine
so just a beautiful beautiful case and I
will be back with white gloves because I
don't want to mess it up so I'm back
with white gloves so we can thoroughly
investigate there's a beauty of a
chassis so the front has a gorgeous
brushed aluminum finish that I would not
recommend touching with your bare hands
because the oils from your hands could H
of thumbprint or fingerprint into it and
it just looks so good we've got a reset
switch and power switch in their sort of
customary stylized metal finish we've
got an indicator LED for the hard drives
as well as a power led silverstone logo
up here at the top on the front very
very classy looking sort of a black
background with a shiny silver front
although you can pop that out and put
something else in there should you so
desire the front door opens up to this
side although i believe it can actually
be reversed yes it can so you can take
out this mechanism and you can have it
open the other way if you want that
reveals four or five and a quarter inch
base and one three and a half inch bay
these covers even are fully aluminum so
you don't have to worry about any ugly
plastic being anywhere on your build oh
I should show you guys this because this
is just awesome check out the great of
the aluminum being used here ok so you
hopefully you can see that but look how
thick that is it is extremely solid
extremely ruggedly built and you don't
get some of that flimsiness that you get
on cheaper aluminum chassis so up at the
top here you can see the front bezel
overlaps a little bit and then the rest
of the top is taken up by the i/o
which is hidden away in a little there
we go compartment there two USB 2.0
ports firewire front microphone in front
headphones there's a USB 3 version
coming but I specifically said I didn't
really care about that so this is the
older USB 2 version of the case also on
the top two 120 millimeter fan mounts
that are tooless fan mounts you just go
ahead and pop the fans in there most
people use them for exhaust however
there's a radiator adapter that I've
also gotten my hands on that you can use
to mount a dual 120 rad there this is
the VGA venting that was talked about on
the front of the case so it actually
pulls air through the hard drive cages
and then so that's with a separate fan
in here so there's a fan in there that
can pull air through this mesh here and
then this right here is its own mesh
that actually has a fan on the other
side that I can show you if I actually
just take off the side panel the other
side panel that that pulls air directly
from the outside and then vincit over
top of the graphics cards now there's
only a couple graphics cards that this
cooling setup wouldn't be ideal for
things like a GTX 590 where it needs to
exhaust air out the back of the card in
order to keep that second GPU
sufficiently cool but most video cards
will definitely then the benefit from
this kind of an intake so you can
actually see the construction here again
all aluminum mesh gorgeous the panels
are a little bit are a little bit wobbly
but it doesn't really affect it much
once they're installed on the case so
here now you can actually see it a
little bit better there's that vent
right there it's probably the one piece
of plastic on the case these two thumb
screws right here hold that 120
millimeter fan all 120 millimeter fans
on in this case that cools the drives
you can put up to three hard drives
three two and a half inch drives per
cage in this bottom cage here and the
top cage up here and I'm trying to get
this screw out so I can show you guys
this once I get around to the other side
cable management is pretty rudimentary
in this case though so you can see here
that the motherboard tray has an
enormous cutout so even if you have a
dual socket setup and I found out that
this is for Zeon's so that's that's just
a backplate but even if
you have a dual socket setup you're
going to be able to access both of the
CPUs and install aftermarket coolers or
whatever you want but there's not much
room down the back for routing something
like a 24-pin ATX cable so you are gonna
be a little bit limited that way on the
rest of the back of the case we don't
find a whole lot so we're gonna go ahead
and turn this back around again those
just the construction of it
these solid pieces of aluminum that hold
it together this is the kind of thing I
appreciate I mean have a lot of people
ask me Linus why didn't you just use a
switch 810 for your personal build to
which I replied well because it's made
of plastic that's why love metal
construction so on this side we find
that same vent that we had on the other
side right here and then we've also got
a nice big side panel window which was
one of the requirements for the build
that I have upcoming because I wanted to
do an ice-water cool build that you can
see all the gorgeous components inside
for so we're gonna go ahead and remove
the other side of the plastic cover here
so you guys can see more clearly what
will be visible inside so the entire
motherboard tray area is pretty much
visible in a TJ 10 build and I'm trying
to figure out how to get yeah that's
right that's how it goes in there you go
so the entire motherboard will be
visible power supply two radiators so
120ml on the back dual 120ml on the top
and then maybe another 120 mil on the
front here if I can remember how to
mount one there there is a way though
alright let's go ahead and pull this off
okay and that leaves us with hard drive
cages so again a couple more pieces of
plastic here but sort of an on a
non-factor there's anti vibration
mounting here here and here for the
three drives that you can pop into this
cage and put that in the wrong way and
it yelled at me there you have it okay
this fan can be replaced in here so it's
a 120 millimeter fan but it is a bit of
a chore it has a nice big guard on it
that will actually prevent any sort of
that lined up with it no I don't think
so it has a nice big guard on it so
that'll prevent any problems from
getting into the fan blades and then
there's the fan connector itself this is
one of the reasons why I would want to
replace the fan
in there because it does not use sleeved
cables we'll be back in a moment all
right we're almost done here guys but I
wanted to show you the rad support
bracket so it's part number rad support
oh nine very creatively because it was
originally brought out for the TJ oh
nine so basically it just takes this top
fan mounting mechanism here which is
meant to be toolless so you just
actually clip the fans in and you
replace the whole thing with two metal
brackets that are designed to hold a
radiator because unlike its earlier
generation cousin the TJ oh seven the TJ
oh nine has a ton of room in the top
above the motherboard which will be here
to put a dual 120 mil rad and some fans
although I don't know if you'd get away
with push-pull I guess we'll find out
once we get it opened up the feet on the
bottom are in Silverstone tradition very
very nice so there you go there's a look
at that and I think we've pretty much
wrapped up what there is to say about
this case sitting does include
Silverstone's arrow slots so those are
eventually added PCI covers and that's
pretty much it I mean yeah it's an older
chassis but especially for an air-cooled
build or for I mean even for our
water-cooled build it's held up against
the test of time extremely well thank
you for checking out this unboxing and
first look at the Silverstone TJ 10
don't forget to subscribe to Linus tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos I forgot the most
important feature of this case which
happens to be the removable motherboard
tray so I'm going to go ahead and remove
these thumb screws and show you guys
just how a removable motherboard tray
might make your life significantly
easier now you can see here in the
bottom of the case where the power
supply is actually securely anchored to
the chassis itself so when you do your
cable management and you route
everything and you tie it all down
what's going to be really easy to do is
to pull the motherboard itself out and
have all those cables be still attached
to it so that's going to be a big
problem for you if you do any sort of
cable management whatsoever so the
removable motherboard tray goes a little
something like that but I would
definitely recommend using it if you do
not do any cable management thank you
