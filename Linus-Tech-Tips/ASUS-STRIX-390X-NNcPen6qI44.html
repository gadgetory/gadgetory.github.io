was nice enough to hand us over a
beautiful Strix Edition card and it's
time to see if the rumors are true
is this just a rebadged 9 290x with a
bunch of more RAM stay tuned to find out
and heat up that like button down below
if you'd like to see us test GPU boost
using 6 tight Nexus freshbooks is the
super simple invoicing solution that
lets you get organized save time and get
paid faster click now to learn more
starting with the good stuff we've got
performance for the actual GPU core the
Asus Strix 390x is running at 1070
megahertz in gaming mode and 1090
megahertz in OC mode for memory you've
got a somewhat classic 512 bit memory
interface and 6 gigahertz of memory
clock all pushing the upgraded 8
gigabytes of gddr5 compared to the 290
X's 4 gigabytes for i/o you've got one
DVID one HDMI and three full-sized
DisplayPort connections so no surprises
there on the bottom of the card you've
got a standard PCIe 16x Gen 3 slot to
plug into your motherboard and in the
top left hand corner it's barren as AMD
has been cross firing their cards
directly through the motherboard for a
while now so no longer is crossfire
fingers needed and in the top right hand
corner you have a 6 pin an 8 pin a PCIe
power connector just to fuel your card
moving to the back of the card we have a
glimpse of what most of you will be
actually seeing in your case if you go
with this card on one side you have a
grid of hexagon holes for which
realistically there are more aesthetic
reasons than anything else on the other
side you have the Strix face logo thing
and near the top of the card you have
the Asus and Strix logos both in
typeface we can also see just how damn
tall the card is the cards dimensions
are eleven point eight inches long five
point four inches tall at one point
seven inches in depth which make it tall
but almost more notable than that is the
measurement of length there's a fair
amount of cases on the market right now
that only support a maximum of 11
inches for a GPU and this card simply
wouldn't fit be careful and just check
your compatibility first you'll be okay
on the top of the card we have some cool
aesthetic styling a backlit Strix logo a
little bit of thermal performance show
off with one of their heat pipes coming
for a pass outside the bounds of the
regular shroud moving to the front of
the card we get a better look at the
direct cu3 cooler with its dual direct
touch 10 millimeter massive heat pipes
that you can actually better see on the
bottom cooling this big heat pipe and
fin array our triple wing blade fans
which are designed to push more pressure
from the edge of the fan in order to
increase maximum air flow with a little
extended edge on the end of the fan
blade so know the performance specs and
we know it's a beast at cooling what
about its actual performance well after
just one claim right off the bat they
say that their 0db gaming mode which is
playing games with the fans not spinning
is a big thing but I needed to test that
and to be honest they're right League of
Legends Starcraft 2 and even World of
Warcraft to a certain degree can take
advantage of this feature but don't
expect this to work with every game in
your library once the load picks up
those fans will start spinning which
don't can be wrong is a really good
thing in terms of actual performance
yeah it's faster than the 290x or at
least our sample but comparing to
drastically different aftermarket cards
gets a little weird as factory clocks
are different all in all this card is
better than our 290x sample but still
trades blows with our 980 not really the
performance I was hoping for when the
390x was announced overclocking ok this
was a little rough considering its stock
load temperatures was 83 degrees already
with the fans on auto I didn't expect
that have much more Headroom keeping the
fans on auto and I did not I was able to
get the core to 11:30 in the memory to
1530 which is an increase just not much
of one but if it was a particularly hot
day I bet the card would have been
unstable it was fine on my bench right
now but a little bit more ambient
temperature and we might have had some
problems in conclusion just like the
290x this is a hot card and
unfortunately just like the 290 X is
still trading blows with the GTX 980
sure it's cheaper than
but if we want to play that game you
should probably just go for a 290x or a
290 anyways looking on newegg.com a 290x
is about a hundred dollars cheaper and a
290 is even cheaper than that they're
within the same kind of performance
envelope what do you guys think thanks
for watching guys if this video suck do
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or even consider supporting us
directly by using our affiliate code to
shop on Amazon I believe they have some
crazy sale thing going on right now or
buying a cool t-shirt that has our logo
on it or with the directly monthly
contribution through the community forum
which makes me all happy and stuff now
that you're doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what to watch next so
click the button in a little top
right-hand corner here to check out a
video where I look at the Nvidia shield
