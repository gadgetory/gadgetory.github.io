graphics cards gets released there's
this immediate focus on high-end with
Nvidia pushing cards like the 1080 and
1070 is having unparalleled performance
while AMD's our X 480 was supposed to be
a VR for the masses type product but
what about the humble gamer without a
bottomless trust fund bank account who
just wants a solid 1080p experience
let's have a look at Nvidia's latest
offering for the blue-collar members of
the PC master-race the GeForce GTX 1050
Ti
mass drop is currently featuring the
Infiniti Peugeot dock split keyboard kit
check it out in the video description so
the GTX 1050 Ti is based off the same
Pascal microarchitecture as the rest of
the GeForce 10 series but it uses the
new GP 107 GPU this is a bit of a change
from the GeForce 9 series where the gtx
950 just ran a cut-down version of the
gtx 960 s GPU with the 1050 Ti you get
768 CUDA cores with the 1392 megahertz
on the boost clock as well as 4
gigabytes of gddr5 vram running on a
128-bit memory bus
although these cards aren't compatible
with SLI you do get other GeForce 10
standard features like Nvidia Ansel 4
cool screenshots as well as support for
DirectX 12 and Vulcan for our benchmarks
we got two flavors of the card the zotac
gtx 750ti mini and the msi gtx 750ti OC
both feature a modest factory overclock
with the zotac running at fourteen
hundred and seventeen megahertz on the
boost clock and the msi running just a
bit higher at fourteen hundred and
fifty-five both of these cards are small
form-factor and don't require any power
beyond what the motherboards PCIe slot
can provide in fact in our Crysis 3 load
tests our system drew less than 160
watts from the wall in entirety while
staying below about 60 ish degrees
Celsius very interesting numbers if
you're fighting size power or thermal
limits in your current system or are
they to give a real answer we of course
need to look at performance in real
games so here's how our 1050 Ti stacked
up on our core i7 68 50k test bench that
we use for all of our testing to
standardize our results and eliminate
bottlenecks all tests were performed at
1080p as this is a less powerful card
that isn't really aimed at users going
for 1440p or 4k starting out with the
after mentioned Crysis 3 which is still
a punishing title after over three and a
half years the 1050 Ti performed quite
well for a card targeted squarely at the
lower middle end of the market it
managed frame rates in the low 40s on
very high presets while bumping things
down to
hi delivers a buttery smooth experience
at 71 frames per second
moving on to rise of the Tomb Raider the
story was somewhat similar with the 1050
TI managing close to 60 FPS on high
settings while very high will set you
back about 10 frames DirectX 12
unfortunately didn't help matters
costing us a few FPS actually which has
been a recurring theme on the latest
Nvidia set of hardware the
much-anticipated battlefield 1 played
very nicely with both of our 1050 T eyes
scoring in the low 60s on Ultra settings
performance on the highest preset in
Doom was similarly impressive with frame
rates in the upper 60s but although
these numbers are quite good for a
budget oriented 1080p focused card does
that necessarily mean the card is a good
value well that depends on how you
define value if you go for strict
dollars per frame analysis the gtx 750ti
doesn't exactly come out looking that
good as you can see on this graph
however many buyers looking for a
graphics card in this price range mostly
care about just smooth 1080p performance
at respectable settings without any
dunking around and right now the $140
GTX 1050 Ti is the cheapest card that
hits all these marks as it scored very
close to or above 60 FPS at high
settings in all of our games and scored
at least in the mid 40s or even higher
at the max presets right now it's
closest competitor on the red team the
$100 rx 460 can't really say the same
but then 40 bucks is a pretty big price
delta at this end of the market however
given that the next step up performance
wise is the RX 470 at $50 more it seems
like the 1050 Ti has a nice little spot
carved out for it for the folks that
just want to come as close to possible
to maxing out titles in 1080p for the
least amount of money assuming that the
actual prices line up with MSRP at all
as I discussed in detail in this video
so if you are in the market for a more
budget oriented card it doesn't do for
PC gaming what you know like Doritos
Locos Tacos did for the simulated
Mexican food market but it'll do
thanks for watching guys this video suck
do you know what to do but it was
awesome and you're like wow more cheap
graphics card yeah hit the like button
get subscribed all that awesome stuff
check out the link to video description
down below where you can buy stuff like
these graphics cards or these cool
shirts or talk about things on the forum
like how we're in video shells or like
how we RAM details or like how our intel
shells or like how we're insert other
brand here shells either of those would
probably work if you want to see another
video check out this one which is on the
RX 470 let's do that and I'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
