something that's a little bit unusual
for us this is the SL 300 condenser
microphone it's part of the studio
series available on editors keys comm
and the idea here is that it is a
relatively low cost USB microphone is
driverless it works on Mac PC or Linux
and according to at least one
testimonial on their site which is of
course the least biased source of
information possible about a product it
is comparable in terms of audio quality
to $2000 microphones which I mean I
guess will let you guys be the judge of
whether it is better at least than a
couple of other microphone solutions we
have that are similar in price so inside
the very well packaged box that has nice
soft foam for protecting the gear when
it's in transit we have the SL 300 which
is I mean I guess they're just kind of
targeting sort of a very clean
unassuming look because people will be
using it as a podcasting mic so they
talk about using it for podcasting as
well as for vocal recording an
instrument recording it does have a
low-pass switch here so you can
eliminate any sound recording under
around 200 Hertz or so so you don't pick
up too much bass and then it also has a
-10 decibel switch which might be useful
so we don't have to do any leveling in
post if you know Luke and I for example
are recording in two of them next to
each other because I tend to talk a lot
louder than him other than that you find
a USB B interface on the bottom and that
is pretty much it you also get a nice
supple USB a 2b cable as well as a shock
mount that just uses your standard
mounting mechanism to mount it to
whatever you want it's got some foam
along the inside as well as elastic cord
around the outside so that you're not
going to rub so that it does what every
shock mount does alright now we did got
a couple of accessories with it so we've
got a dual layer pop filter this is I
think a $30.00 adder is what we saw it
for and then we've also got the portable
vocal booth Pro now we do some
voiceovers for the pre-roll ads that we
run before our videos and what we've
noticed is that aside from having issues
with the the P sounds that cause unknown
Ceri harshness in the recording so we've
got the pop filter for that we also
found we're getting a lot of echo
because we don't have an optimal
recording environment so this supposedly
will help and we're going to give you
guys some before and afters of how this
stuff is working for us right here in
just a moment I guess I should also
mention a couple of other things as a
five-year warranty and it has dual
thirty four millimeter internal shock
mounted diaphragms so that's something I
also meant to mention as well alright so
now that we've actually set up the
entire editor's Keys setup the pop
filter is actually fairly rudimentary it
just comes with a standard tension
mounted clamp down here so you can
affixed that to the stand that the
microphone itself sits on you can fix it
to this bracket right here or here
wherever the heck you would want and you
can reposition it with pretty much
infinite flexibility so you can tighten
this to adjust the tension here to make
sure that it doesn't accidentally slip
around and other than that yeah that's
pretty straightforward next up we've got
the shock mount so it was pretty easy to
slip the microphone into it it's just
you know a standard sort of foam insert
and then it's also got a gap in the back
here so it just stretches wider to
accommodate the microphone and it's just
pressure mounted like that so you don't
actually have to clip anything into
place if there was something I was going
to complain about because overall we've
actually already done our recording test
so we're filming this after we had
already done it sounds quite nice if
there was something I was going to
complain about it would probably be that
this is a little bit flimsy right here
and I would like to be able to tighten
it and have it really stay in place a
little bit more easily than that I think
we're going to go ahead and take a short
break here so that I can show you guys
how this guy works well I guess I can
show you from the ground so the stand it
comes with is very robust we were
actually impressed with the quality of
the stand so you've got nice plastic
feet right here you've got nice
attention to detail and things like the
loosening and tightening mechanisms it
doesn't feel it doesn't feel cheap at
all so that's really nice to have
there's also a lock here so you can keep
it from accidentally you know slipping
or something like that evidently and
then the construction of the portable
booth has kind of a metal backing on it
so that's a perforated metal backing
it's got little
sort of foam feet on the bottom I
wouldn't call them rubber feet but
little three little foam feet on the
bottom so you could set it up on a desk
if you want if you don't want to set it
up on the stand we actually had to
remove one of the feet in order to
attach the stand to it so that comes off
just like that and then the stand screws
into the bottom and then it has acoustic
pyramid foam all on the inside the whole
thing actually folds up so you can
loosen these two feet a little bit right
here and then you can fold the thing up
like this if you did want to transport
it or take it anywhere with you so
actually I guess that's all there pretty
much is to say about it and it's going
to come down to how does it actually
sound so now it's time for our
microphone test I know we don't have a
whole bunch of other studio mics to
compare against but if nothing else we
can give you guys some idea what we
wanted this thing for aside from a more
podcast East I'll show that might be
coming stay tuned for that by comparing
it to some of the other microphone
technologies that we have available to
us so for comparison we have a
reasonably I'd say mid range wireless
lav mic so this is an e w100 g3 from
Sennheiser with the stock lab we've also
got an NT g2 so this is a fairly well
regarded Road mic pardon me red mic so
that's a shotgun microphone we've got a
shure beta 57 see some famous stand-up
comedians using it's an old design but
tried and true and then finally we have
the SL 300 which has a very satisfying
blue LED now that we've actually hooked
it up in its little portable recording
studio thing and we're going to be
positioning ourselves pretty close to it
because we're going for that AM radio
deep sound whether it's a podcast or a
pre-recorded message in front of our
videos so in order to give you guys some
idea of the difference in the recording
quality we're going to record this in
four different ways and it is my VPN
hotspot shield pre-roll that I do in
front of some of my videos so first up
we're going to take these three mics all
at the same time because that's pretty
easy and here we go

now to learn more so in order to be fair
to the other microphones we wanted to
try this one without the benefit of the
recording studio thing that auction
actually costs about as much as the
microphone so here we go guys
hotspot Shield VPN service makes your
browsing experience safer more secure
and more private click now to learn more
and finally because we tested the other
microphones without a pop filter which
we didn't have before let's go ahead and
take a crack at that with this one as
well hotspot Shield VPN service makes
your browsing experience safer more
secure and more private click now to
learn more I'll leave it to you guys
what's actually better and which sound
you prefer but if nothing else this has
been a little bit of an interesting
investigation into how different
microphones will produce different
sounds even with the same voice doing
the same thing over and over and over
