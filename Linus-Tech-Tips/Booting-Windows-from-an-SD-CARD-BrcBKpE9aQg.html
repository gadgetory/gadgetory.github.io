when we were booting dinosaur operating
systems like Windows 7
a typical high-performance SSD would be
rated somewhere in the neighborhood of
around 230 to 250 megabytes a second for
reads and writes which got me thinking
when Sony released SD cards that are
rated up to 300 megabytes a second okay
technically $2.99 on the writes could we
boot windows from these and what would
the experience be like
I fix its protec toolkit gives you the
tools you need to tackle any electronics
repair challenge visit ifixit.com slash
linus at the link below and get yours
today
so these puppies have actually been out
for quite a while but it took Sony
almost a year to send them to us because
apparently they and along with anything
else made of NAND flash memory have been
in very very short supply so what's
special about them is not really the
capacity I mean 128 gigs should be noted
is pretty decent for an SSD from you
know back when these kinds of speeds
would have been reasonable but it's not
that it's that because these are SDXC -
so these are UHS 2 cards and high-end
ones at that you've actually got
additional contact pins on the back of
them that enable these extra speeds now
what that means is that while they are
backwards compatible with devices and
with card readers that are only SDXC
capable to get the most out of it we are
gonna need a special reader so this is
the the wow that's a terrible product
name I mean I guess it's descriptive
this is the Sony UHS 2 compatible
high-speed it doesn't explicitly say
it's a SD card reader but whatever minor
details so it's USB 3 and it's got a
compatible slot back there for all those
extra pins now the reason we need this
is that while SD to SATA adapters which
you know would allow us to plug this
into a SATA port do actually exist in
fact we covered a particularly
abominable one of them a little while
ago on this channel takes 10 micro SD s
and then I gives you one stated
interface these products because they're
pretty stupid haven't been updated in a
long time which means they're using very
outdated controllers in fact this is
only running SATA 1 speeds and that was
the least of its problems in terms of
performance so we actually need that
reader in order to plug our card into
the
at all we're also gonna need this
windows installed USB all right so
there's our install right looks like I
forgot about this so you can install
Windows to a USB device I was actually a
little bit worried there that we just
wasn't gonna show up at all
but you need a special type of Windows
installation you can't just do it by
putting a USB install disk in the system
and installing it - it doesn't like that
so what we have to do is we have to
create what's called a windows to go
installation now I've never successfully
gotten that to work before so yeah so
we're gonna use a utility called Rufus
we're gonna grab a Windows 10 image that
we downloaded from Microsoft and then we
just need to point it at our USB Drive
it's supposed to just be right here so
Microsoft in their infinite wisdom
stopped allowing you to create a Windows
to go installer using the not the ISO
Vata like windows media creation tool
version so what you have to do is
actually find a disk so fortunately I
actually just when I was doing an audit
of our of our software around here
I just realized some of our windows
installs were not a hundred percent
correctly legit so I just like ran out
and bought a bunch of them so otherwise
I wouldn't have a genuine Windows 10
disk because otherwise we've done
everything digitally but what you need
to have is an act
tool disk and you have to create an ISO
from that so that's what we're gonna
have to do here we're gonna have to go
back in time and rip this disk okay so
we've got a Windows 10 image that
theoretically should work now your
target drive doesn't have the fixed up
Oh what the hell are we doing no we
don't want to use this shoot we need
this
okay hold on no there we go no label 128
gig okay hopefully this won't give us
any errors doesn't bode well I think
we're gonna have to get some lunch or
something I'm really hungry actually
here we are so that did take a fair bit
longer than usual but by all appearances
this is like pretty normal window stuff
C Drive Sony mrw s1 USB device cool
alright so let's do some stuff then oh
okay
I'm feeling a little bit of leg Wow
actually hold up a hold on a second like
you see anything measured in
milliseconds you go it's probably pretty
small but 9,000 milliseconds is nine
seconds of average response time the
main reason that we use SSD controllers
and not SD cards is not the read and
write speeds because those are
sequential I mean the USB interface is
part of the problem because compared to
SATA or PCI Express nvme it's much less
optimized for random performance but the
other issue is that an SD card is a
relatively simple device it's just a
little bit of NAND flash and there's not
really to my knowledge really any logic
on it compared to an SSD which has like
these it's complex controller it'll in a
lot of cases have like a dram cache
and then it has many NAND flash dyes on
it and then it can read from and write
to them sometimes all at once in a very
strategic manner so that it can optimize
performance and endurance but even if
it's not that bad I actually wouldn't
recommend this as a daily driver system
because you would kill your SD card
probably very quickly it's like even
though this SD card can do you know 300
megabytes a second reads and writes you
can see we're at 99% usage at like one
mega second total and that's because it
is not optimized bear in mind of course
that this is all on an eight-core
Extreme Edition processor or 10 core 10
chord excuse me it's interesting that
even when it's basically not doing
anything zero to one megabyte a second
it still registers as being a hundred
percent active with average response
times in the three to five seconds range
so we should get some drivers so we need
a goal for ourselves we've got Windows
running off an SD card but how normal is
this experience can we game off it we
need to get a game going and steam is
still updating though I think this might
actually be worse than running a
mechanical drive it's writing at a
whopping 500 kilobytes per second so
it's clearly not doing a lack of a lot
No
the graphics driver is not compatible
with this version of Windows how does it
even know the difference
that's stupid like looking at this
there's no there's no discernible
difference here it's just Windows so
maybe it's just that we need a bazillion
updates which might be part of what it's
been doing in the background here it's
got 79 percent of them downloaded it's
making everything so slow I really need
steam to finish though a full day a full
day it took over a full day for all of
those Windows updates to run utterly
ridiculous
what we're doing now is with everything
updated the game installed I haven't
tried it yet we're gonna find out how
bad or good is the experience this is it
okay we're in so the first thing that's
noticeable other than that Razors gaming
software managed to prompt me to install
it itself is that our display is scaling
correctly this is great so as long as oh
no Nvidia control panel though that's
weird but this is showing up
okay I really thought this is gonna be a
lot better without stuff running in the
background like it's measuring it bytes
per second half a megabyte a second as
far as I can tell it looks like we are
ready to go and run a game so I
installed doom which means that my drive
is actually almost totally full like
isn't that trippy opening up this PC and
there's there's no Drive there's just
USB I just don't know how long it's
gonna take to launch
that's not bad okay
I haven't played a ton of doom but like
that seemed like a very serviceable load
time what I do with this oh oh we got a
hitch there pitch those hitches might
have actually been anomalies this is not
bad I am impressed
there you go oh yeah
get over it oh okay
leg leg honestly this experience is way
better than I expected you know I think
the issues before with a little bit of
leg might have just been anomalies
because this is really smooth it's not
bad at all ah I mean the games called
doom so you know I think we have our
answer so can you do it the answer is
yes so yeah it's a pretty crap
experience to boot off of All Things
Considered but it's not designed for
that kind of use and they're blazing
fast for just straight reads and
straight writes and I still think it's
impressive that it works at all I mean
the fact that you can run Windows off of
something this big and it's usable not
to mention that like okay compared to
when I got into PCs the capacity it's
actually similar to what you might have
gotten out of something like a Mac store
diamond max 9 like the hard drive I got
for my first self built computer was a
hundred and twenty gigs and that is
freaking incredible because I like to
tell myself that that wasn't that long
ago private Internet access supports a
variety of VPN protocols and types of
encryption and authentication allowing
you to dial in exactly the level of
privacy protection that you need
they've got apps for Windows Mac OS
Android iOS Linux and Google Chrome with
support for others coming soon you can
connect up to five devices at the same
time like your phone your laptop your
desktop and their apps include DNS leak
protection and ipv6 leak protection you
can check it out today at the link in
the video description and if you've
already got it well you can give it as a
gift as well so don't miss out so thanks
for watching guys if you just like this
video you can hit that button but if you
liked it hit like get subscribed maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we've featured at the link in the
video description though again not for
booting windows off of maybe just
for like a very high-speed camera for
example while you're down there you can
check out our merch store which has cool
shirts like the one I'm wearing as well
