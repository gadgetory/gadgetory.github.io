Computex 2016 check out their lap dog in
the video description down below also
thank you to 12 msi for sending us here
and we're going to check out their aigis
ex desktop the aigis ex is a bare-bones
rig in north america meaning it will
come with the chassis the motherboard
the power supply the cooling system and
then you're on your own to figure out
the CPU memory graphics card storage
that kind of stuff outside of North
America can be set as an entire kit
starting on the outside its appearance
is pretty awesome it reminds me of some
like crazy robot helmet or something so
that's pretty cool in terms of i/o on
the front you have a power button
headphone and microphone ports on the
right hand side then on the top there is
a optical drive eject button which will
get more into later on a big msi shield
for the automatic overclocking of your
cpu then on the left hand side we have
USB type-c that's three USB 3.1 type c
and then two USB 3.0 ports one of them
being a charging port and then on the
very bottom between the feet on the
front there is an output for HDMI so if
someone wanted to have like a VR headset
or something it would make sense to plug
it in there then on the back the custom
motherboard has six USB 3.0 ports two
USB 2.0 ports a ps2 port which I
actually personally appreciate I like
being all the plug in old keyboards an
Ethernet jack wireless AC connections
six audio jacks and then there's a
really really short HDMI cable which is
a pass-through that goes from your
graphics card all the way to the front
of the case jumping on to the inside you
can see that the graphics card is
vertically mounted and that there are
three individual cooling zones so the
graphics card is able to breathe through
the side panel of the case the CPU is
actually cooled through a 90 millimeter
radiator that's in the bottom of the
case and ejects out of the bottom not
directly touching the power supply's air
and then the power supply has its own
cooling set in the very bottom of the
aigis X and then under the lid at the
top you have access to one two and a
half inch drive bay to three and a half
inch drive bays and those are actually
tucked under a slimline optical drive
the motherboard supports two m dot two
slots and two RAM slots so you can get
up to 32 gigs of ram but they're split
up so one Rams
and one m2 slot is in the main
compartment of the case and one Ram slot
and one m2 slot are mounted on the back
of the motherboard so all you have to do
is take off the left side panel and you
can access half of that stuff so you can
easily upgrade the memory and the m-dot
- and I do know that the pre-built kits
that will be sold outside of North
America will not have either of these
populated so if you want to user upgrade
your system you can add some RAM and
around some storage through m2 very
easily just by taking off that one side
panel and that's pretty much it in North
America you add whatever sixth
generation skylake CPU you want you add
what other graphics card you want you
add some RAM and some storage and you're
pretty much good to go and some like
crazy robotics styled computer case
called the ASX thanks for watching this
video and thanks to Corsair for sending
us to coputex 2016 this year check out
their lap dog in the video description
down below it lets you play games on
your couch with a full-size keyboard and
mouse pretty sweet also thank you to msi
for sending us here as well like
literally right here to check out their
ASX let me know what you guys think
he'll do description down below and stay
subscribed alliance tech tips for all
the rest of our Computex content there
we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
