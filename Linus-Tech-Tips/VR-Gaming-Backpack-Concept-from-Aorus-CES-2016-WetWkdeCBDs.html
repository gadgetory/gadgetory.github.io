alright guys we're talking about the
Auris VR backpack this thing's pretty
sick it works with the Auris x7 DT which
has a desktop 980 in it so it should be
pretty powerful the demo that they used
here today was battlefield but ok ok
what the what what is this thing for a
while now people have been doing really
ghetto ass sludgy solutions for being
able to run like a desktop rag off of
their back or even a laptop with like a
chopped-up backpack or something so that
they could play VR with the rig mounted
on their back this helps in a lot of
ways it makes it so that you're more
mobile and it also makes it so that the
cable isn't a problem which is really
annoying if you want to be moving around
for your VR experience this thing's
pretty cool it's fairly easy to strap
the laptop in the whole unit with the
laptop and the backpack is only three
and a half pounds so it weighs like
basically nothing when it's on your back
there's a chest strap which keeps it
locked in place nice and tight there's
pouches on the side of the belt which I
actually didn't try on this extended
belt thing but that's fine the the one
pouch is to hold the controller there
having ideas that maybe in the future
they'll be able to mount a semi curved
battery on the back so you can have
extended battery life on your laptop and
then for the touch controllers that'll
later be coming for the oculus they're
thinking of having little holsters for
the touch controllers this is pretty
sick but there are some problems like
for instance when we look at the gun
they were playing battlefield so this
was one of the things that you aimed
with be gun and the headset controls
where you looked so it was kind of weird
because if you look to the left and move
the gun to the left instead of having
your screen just look to the left a
little bit it did both of those
movements meaning that it totaled two
like here so it felt a little unnatural
when you're playing but I don't actually
think that's the problem of the backpack
that's just some other things that need
to step up and get to that level now
there's some things that they can help
with this as well it's a standing
experience but you don't move because
there's no tracking for your legs so I
was playing battlefield and just using
the little thumb stick controller on the
gun to actually move around which is not
ideal but
if you use something like a vibe this
might be a much better solution or if
you have a connect set up so that you
can actually see what your legs are
doing so there's actually any point to
be standing at all then that's pretty
cool this is still an early revision the
rift isn't out yet the vibe isn't out
yet so obviously this doesn't really
need to be oh yeah that's fine there's
some things that are gonna be changing
one of them hopefully my suggestion is
that they're gonna open up the
compatibility for laptops in the back
maybe with velcro straps to tie things
down or whatever yeah more aureus
laptops would be great more laptops in
general would be great as well because
the more things that work with this the
more other people are gonna try to make
things that also work with this that
aren't necessarily laptops which is
super super important wearing it felt
very comfortable and all it really made
me want was more of these things and a
bunch of dudes and basically what you'd
think of as laser tag but an actual
video game in like a laser tag arena
because that would be super freakin
awesome to run around with VR headsets
and play laser tag essentially but have
it look like Battlefield that would be
super cool it's a relatively simple
concept but I think they kind of nailed
it let me know what you guys think in
the comments down below and thank you to
Squarespace for sending us here to 20
CES 2016 if you want to set up a website
a simple website for something like
maybe a VR arcade where people wear
backpacks with laptops on them and shoot
each other with fake guns that would be
great you could do that on Squarespace
you can set up a commerce module so
people could buy tickets to your thing
relatively easily you can use our
template so it looks really good even if
you're not a very aesthetically tuned
person and if you have any problems with
that there's live chat support and 24/7
email support whatever you need hit up
