I think people are pretty excited about
I know I am Corsair has fans now so fans
okay not complicated right there's like
a motor in the middle in the side the
hub there's uh you know blades that like
spin around there's a frame what all can
be done in order to innovate all fans
well I think we've seen over the last
couple of years that a lot can be done
to innovate on fans higher quality
bearings will reduce noise more better
design than okay better design into the
exact shape the design of the blades can
improve air flow and you can also do a
bunch of other stuff so Corsair has okay
check this out they have replaced what
would be the more of a traditional just
either closed or open corner fan design
with sort of a it's got the advantages
of closed corner and that it's a little
bit more solid it's a little bit more
sturdy it's got the advantages of open
corner in that you can more easily a fix
short screws through them and sort of
like run screw then from this way and
bolt them into a radiator whatever else
the case may be I mean it's take a
little bit of work at it but there you
go and then they've also put in noise
dampening so noise dampening is a huge
thing for fans because no matter how
smooth the rotation of your fan is no
matter how awesome your bearing is
there's always going to be a little bit
of vibration pass along to the case so
using rubber here here here and here
means that it's pretty difficult for
that vibration to be passed to your case
you can also see little little touches
like using all black connectors and all
black wires these are things that course
are first started doing on their power
supplies to really set them apart from
the competition in terms of aesthetics
Corsair has also done something kind of
cool and that is the implementation of
this multi ring system so every Corsair
fan whether it's an AFC reso flow
optimized series or whether it is an SP
series or static pressure optimized
series of fan comes with these
replaceable I've never done this before
so
kind of guessing right now but maybe
yeah like that or something
so guys you just use a screwdriver put
it in here
pop the one clip out and then the rest
of them will follow very easily and you
can easily replace it with white blue or
red and I'm sure Coursera will look into
the possibility of doing other colors in
the future whatever the case may be so
there you go that's yet another
innovation where instead of releasing
like a boatload of different SKUs and
different colors course there's just
included everything you need to put a
nice little accent color to go with your
build on the fan right out of the box so
I think that's kind of neat so what else
can you innovate on well you can
innovate on whatever this can is optimal
kit we got it sorry about that guys the
door was open so sound was passing right
through anyway um so you can you can
innovate on what they're optimized for
so the AF series is optimized for air
flow much like competing fans such as
no-no-no of an outlet over here it's
much like the Antec true part true quiet
pro so what does that mean that means
these are for situations like in the
front or back in the case where there's
very little restriction if you wanted to
use an AF series fan on something like a
radiator or heat sink you wouldn't get
the optimal performance because the way
the fans are scooping the air and
blowing it out towards the back of the
fan it is more if there's something in
the way you're going to lose a lot of
what you're trying to move through out
around the in between the fins whereas
if you have a completely open air
environment they are very aggressively
scooped in order to move as much air as
possible in a low restriction
environment so they've also lowered the
size of the hub in the middle which
gives you just more overall blade and
less overall dead zone is what it's
called in the middle where you're not
actually moving any air
and until we actually get these on the
test bench although I've got some
numbers that look pretty promising I
haven't I haven't actually done acoustic
testing personally on these ones yet
though in terms of the subjective
testing so I've seen the objective tests
for their performance as well as for
their noise output but I haven't real
put them through the paces for how do
they sound when you undervolt them do
they develop any ticking do they have
more of a low drone do they have a high
whine so that I am really really looking
forward to so there you go they are
available in a variety of configurations
although let's finish looking at what's
in the package here so we've got a low
noise adapter as well as four included
black screws Corsair is so good at those
nice little touches including black
screws instead of silver screws
including a sleeved inline resistor and
set it with black connectors and black
cables instead of you know not having
black connectors and black cables and
not having it be sleep solutions guide
2012 bunch of course their products and
whatnot in there so that's good stop you
don't return this product to the store
return it to Corsair or talk to their
tech support right so what I'll do they
have first of all you can buy their fans
in single or dual packs so dual packs
come with two fans inside single tax
come with you guessed it one fan inside
you can also get them in a variety of
different configurations so we've got
140 millimeter quiet pans 120 millimeter
quiet fans and 120 millimeter
performance fans so these are actually
using the same overall blade design it's
pretty much the same thing but the
difference is the default rpm the
default noise and the amount of airflow
that obviously they will use so what
would you want to quiet fan for
personally I would use a quiet Edition
fan for running even quieter you know in
a super silent PC kind of configuration
that was what that's what I would want
that for what would you use the higher
speed one for well if you were if you
say for example you had an asus
motherboard with their fan configuration
whatever it's called a easy fan to some
what's called easy fan fan expert found
expert to so you could use one of these
higher performance ones to run at high
speed when things are getting hot and to
turn down to very low speeds when things
are getting not as hot so that's uh
that's why I eat one of our higher
performance one also if you're not as
sensitive to noise personally on the
silence freak when it comes to fans and
cooling so I have zero interest in this
one and I am all about this quiet
addition one here because I'm going to
turn it down even lower and see just how
quiet I can get it they also show an
example of the system configured with
their fans so you can see here with the
radiator there's a
push pull configuration they're using
pressure fans you can tell from the
shape of the blades for the front of the
case they're using airflow fans you can
tell from the shape of the blades again
just because it's more free flow more
open air same thing with the top of the
case so really that is where you're
concerned with pressure although for me
personally I find there to be advantages
to pressure fans in many different
scenarios even even in the front of a
case for example where a lot of cases
don't just have free mesh in the front
so if you have a case say sorry about
that guy's battery died but if you have
a case where the front panel is actually
quite restrictive then you're going to
want to look at maybe using pressure
fans in those scenarios so if you need
any help just you know check out the
forum the NCIX forums or whatever else
and see what people think but in most
cases there will be a more optimized fan
for your particular application so thank
you for checking out my unboxing your
first look at course there's a F series
fans and don't forget to subscribe -
