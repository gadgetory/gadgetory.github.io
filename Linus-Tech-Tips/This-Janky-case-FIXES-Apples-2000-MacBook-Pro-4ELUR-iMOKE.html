Pro now super thin so you're going to
need something to protect it's
beautifully finished surface and without
any damn ports because you know whatever
Yolo so the average person thinks well
gee I guess I'll just get myself a case
okay so there's your case and I'll get
myself a doc so I've got a bunch reports
okay whatever anyway the point is that's
thinking inside the box meet the dark
case it's a case it's a dot
experience MSI's GS 63 VR laptop now
with nvidia geforce gtx 1070 max-q check
it out at the link below I had never
actually heard of this company before
they're sort of like in India except I
don't think they are at all there's
really nothing on here at all which made
me think that because these guys are
doing a crowdfunding campaign that they
were like an unheard of nobody but then
when I got my shipment it was from
somewhere in China that seems to be some
kind of fairly well-established
electronics manufacturer although maybe
they're like contract manufacturing oh
there we go
ha that was exhausting alright so inside
I actually have no idea if there are any
options or anything like that but it
looks like what I've got is sort of a
faux leather kind of affair here there
is a magnetic sleeve closing mechanism
here okay look I don't do a lot of
videos on laptop cases the only reason
I'm doing this one is because I thought
that this whole concept was pretty novel
so this is the beta version we invite
you to review this product constructive
feedback will be delivered to our
product team very cool this sticker is
ugly appearance you can go so let's try
it out oh right accessories so you also
get what I hope is a Thunderbolt cable
that would be pretty sick but it is not
labeled actually there's a little bit of
paint on here and then we've got maybe
it's a driver CD Oh unboxing experience
ruins forget it I'm going back to my
trailer
okay I've started up my trauma and we're
going to open this up more silver more
silver paper QuickStart guide first of
all let's see
you know how well the max looks pants I
mean when you're going to build a case
that is exactly made for one particular
laptop you better get the fit right wow
this thing's probably going to be really
expensive just based on like this really
nice closed cell foam in it so that's
the kind of stuff where like you can
tell they're going for the premium
market that cares more about having
beautiful packaging than about saving a
bug all right in terms of the synth
though not quite nice there's a little
bit of leeway from side to side okay
what okay now that obviously wasn't
going to go very well it seems like
you're supposed to put your cable right
up here I mean maybe that was in the
QuickStart guide no not in the
QuickStart guide okay fine I do you
actually see why they want you looking
at the instructions because I thought
that this was a simple like fun durable
configuration but it's not this is a USB
type-c but USB dock not a funder bulldog
which makes sense because why would you
be powering it when you're out and about
so it's actually got three USB type-c
ports so this one at the back then you
just kind of sit it there on top of the
case so this one at the back plugs into
your into your power port on the laptop
and it's not the world's most elegant
solution but like it should be fine
this is what happens when you don't
actually use your Mac every time you
turn it on it's like okay so this is
interesting now the way I had thought it
would work is that you plug this into
the power and you get power pass-through
but the laptop actually doesn't charge
while you're plugged in like that so
then I thought okay well maybe it's this
one but that's not this is just
regular USB 3.1 port these are 3.0 micro
SD SD HDMI Ethernet so no if you want to
actually charge your device at the same
time you have to plug them both in but
what I don't know is how that affects
the functionality of the dock
let's try plugging something in on it so
let's try plugging in networking yeah
you got to plug in on the other side
this is a very definition of jacking
someone stuff get it because it's John's
Ethernet jack anyway what if I plug in
like a USB devices okay okay this is the
zark so this is clearly pre-production
there are some tolerance issues with the
port so when this light was red that was
bad I had to wiggle this back one a
little bit it turned green and now check
it out so my Fatih 32 USB Drive shows up
the dock appears to be working
but networking still isn't working even
though it's great another revelation is
that with this poor tree wiggled yet the
power does pass-through so your wall
jack powers both the hub and the MacBook
Hey okay there we go
fantastic so it's got gigabit networking
which is a plus not all docks
especially inexpensive ones have gigabit
and all that's left now is I guess to
throw on a monitor make sure the HDMI
works okay all right
see boom just like that not bad Silvan
are resolving an incredibly first world
problem here of you know not wanting to
carry around a slightly bigger case and
a dongle like this so this one in
particular has almost exactly the same
i/o micro SD SD power pass-through
gigabit ethernet 3 USB 3 is an HDMI yes
we are but is this actually a pretty
cool solution well if I didn't think so
then when they reached out about sending
us one I would have said no forget it
that looks stupid so yeah I like it
