1440 really was an emotional time for me
because I used to run these benchmarks
on my 30 inch Samsung monitor which my
cat destroyed several months ago so
we've obtained a new monitor which is
2560 by 1440 instead of 2560 by 1600 and
we are back to the races benchmarking
graphics cards and telling you at high
resolutions greater than 1080p what is
the best card for your dollar or in the
case of something like a gtx titan
thousand dollars now i'm going to get
through this methodology stuff as
quickly as i can we use a thirty nine
sixty x overclock to four gigahertz
cooled by in each 100 we use a p9 x79
deluxe motherboard we use an antique
high current pro thousand watt a 128 gig
SSD and we use a variety of graphics
cards obviously for our testing we're
running on windows 7 and we are running
the latest beta drivers for both AMD and
NVIDIA we run all graphics cards
overclocked
because overclocking is free I guess a
few times not worth anything but it
really doesn't take that long because
all you have to do is check out the
overclocking settings we're using in the
graph or spreadsheet that's below than
the video description and that will give
you some idea where to start so it
really shouldn't take you very long at
all we're testing our games using fraps
and because we're not doing any dual GPU
or triple GPU setups it should still
fairly be a fairly accurate
representation of the performance of the
cards however it should be noted that
particularly if you're running SLI or
crossfire configurations it's important
to use a frame capture setup to get the
most realistic possible results now all
of our games are not only being run at
high resolutions but also at very high
detail settings because well the
justification for it is if you're going
to spend $300 on a graphics card you
better be running at high details in
this one we see what's going to become a
recurring theme and that is that memory
bandwidth and Men
riah mount seem to be holding back the
660ti and the gtx 680 this is something
we did not observe in our 1080p
benchmarks so there is a very clear
division where tighten and 780 are up
here seven nine 70 and 79 50 are here
and 680 and 660ti are trailing at the
bottom in Tomb Raider 2013 it really is
men against boys with the Titan and the
GTX 780 coming out on top however of
course they are priced much higher than
the cards that they are now replacing
from Nvidia zone lineup and the 79 fifty
and seventy nine seventy Metro last
light is a game that actually kind of
creamed all of these cards even the GTX
Titan
only ran at just over 20 FPS average
however I mean okay so we learned that
you need multiple gk110 GPUs in order to
run this game smoothly at 2560 by 1440
we also learned that sometimes it's not
feasible on current generation hardware
to turn games up to the very maximum but
with all that said we still do see a
clear difference in performance between
that top-tier GPUs the mid tier where
those AMD cards are benefiting from
their extra memory bandwidth and extra
memory and then the older being phased
out 600 series of GeForce graphics cards
I'm going to do Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 3
Blood Dragon together because even
though the performance in these two
games is quite different with Far Cry 3
being much more demanding due to the
different graphical style the way that
the cards are segmented against each
other in terms of performance is very
similar and this is one of the ones
where and I mean NVIDIA is quoting
around a 35% improvement on average
going from a 680 to a 780 and this one
we see that figure just destroyed at
2560 by 1440 a GTX 780 is going to give
you almost double the performance of the
680 card that it's replacing and almost
double the performance of something from
the competing red team such as a 79 70
it does cost significantly more than a
79 70 but there you have it if you are a
far cry 3 aficionado guys the 780 is
worth a look see if you want to play
at high resolutions let's wrap it up
with the classic but candid run Crysis 3
and the answer is yes the GTX 780
destroys its predecessor in Crysis 3 and
we can attribute this in all likelihood
to the fact that it has 50% more CUDA
cores 50 percent wider memory bus and
50% more ram giving it just 50% more
muscle overall it is a true replacement
for the 680 in this case and yeah again
if you're a Crysis 3 lover then the 780
is definitely worth a look it is a
significantly more powerful GPU with its
Titan DNA and really much closer to
Titan performance than anything else and
of course it's much lower price point
compared to the GTX Titan now the
conclusion isn't really as cut and dried
as this is the best-performing GTX
numbered series card so it's pretty much
the one to buy however it's pretty clear
that if you were shopping for a Titan
the 780 is definitely worth having a
look at it has most of the performance
of a Titan particularly after you
overclock it and comes in at a much
lower price point it's an obvious
successor for the GTX 680 which looks
distinctly last generation in terms of
its performance compared to the 780 but
things get a little bit muddier when you
consider that something like a 79 70
from the red team does offer up a lot of
the performance that you'll need to run
games at medium to high settings even at
high resolutions it has three gigs of
memory and because of the never settle
bundle it comes with a bunch of really
cool games
whereas Nvidia cards right now are
limited to just coming with Mitch for
last light but then of course there's
the intangibles to weigh in such as the
fact that you can actually upgrade these
GPUs to multi-gpu configurations in SLI
and get a tangible noticeable
performance improvement there's the fact
that they run quieter there's the fact
that GeForce experience is going to make
things a little bit more turnkey so you
don't have to go in and tweak things and
tune them and remember to download your
latest drivers which honestly for most
of the people watching this video right
now it's probably not a factor but if
you're recommending a
to someone who is an avid gamer but not
a hardware enthusiast might be something
to consider so there you have it guys
