100% honest with you guys I actually
don't know James how much did we spend
on this thing six grand is that the
baseball not quite but almost oh it's
too bad praying to the Apple gods
doesn't make their products any cheaper
okay so Apple is finally demonstrating
in a way with like a real actual product
that you can really actually buy that
they give a about the enthusiast
prosumer / professional all those
categories because for a while there you
could make a pretty strong argument for
them just giving exactly 0s about any of
those groups of end-users this is the
iMac Pro and I have been known to give
Apple crap about throwing Pro on
anything that they're trying to sell to
home users who want to feel all warm and
fuzzy and professional but this thing
does look pretty Pro spec wise our model
rocks a 27 inch display 5k z on W the W
is for workstation Pro workstation okay
we're on the same page so far 32 gigs of
ECC memory one terabyte SSD a Vega 56
graphics card okay that's not especially
professional FaceTime camera or
Thunderbolt 3 ports and something that
I've been asking for proper support from
Apple 4 for quite some time something I
actually didn't realize that this was
gonna have until I saw it on the box
oh I'm sorry Brendan wow this is a lot
of packaging gotta give Apple credit
they they want stuff to get to you in
one piece did I did I say what the thing
was that I had 10 gigabit networking
because for years
Apple has been on the no we don't need
10 Gigabit LAN because we have
Thunderbolt Train but the reality is
that Thunderbolt is a point-to-point
connection which is great for end user
or prosumer but as soon as you need to
share resources Ethernet is the way to
go
like if
our workplace was set up around the Mac
it would be nearly impossible for one
person to pick up where someone else
left off on a project if somebody phoned
in sick for example what the hell look
at all the packaging for this power cord
first of all make sure you open this
your power cords in there it's got a
little pull tab then this in tight look
at the box they designed to hold this
power cord I mean I'm all for a great
unboxing experience and everything but
this was three pieces I mean three
easily recyclable brown cardboard pieces
mind you but like four pieces four
pieces world's most amazing power cord
oh wait no it's just a normal power cord
that sits flush with the back here
computer well we won't be needing these
although Vega 56 graphics card I mean
you could game on this thing do some
cryptocurrency mining well this is
professional look at that a number pad
so there are some improvements even to
the peripherals that from my personal
experience are legendarily non ergonomic
the keyboard is okay but I'm still not a
fan of this Mouse design got your
gesture nonsense on the top you got your
left you got your right click yeah okay
I always get this feeling when I'm
opening up Apple products that like
because I don't worship them as a
company I like somehow undeserving of an
experience right now that someone else
somewhere on earth would just be so
excited for I just they're doing a lot
right here but I'm still not necessarily
sold on $6,000 for this particular spec
regardless of whether it's
Canadian rupees or US dollars Wow it's
really light and they actually managed
to I mean at least to the naked eye I
don't have the old previous iMac for
comparison because I sold it but to the
eye doesn't look that big by comparison
so they have crowned a lot of
performance in here I will say this
though they have clearly left larger
vents for cooling back there look at
that and what's also interesting back
here is that gone is the convenient
hatch where you can access your memory
modules to upgrade them io wise we've
got your audio connectors still on the
back I guess we were not getting away
from that SD card reader nice to see
four USB threes of some flavor or
another for Thunderbolt that is gorgeous
and 10 Gigabit LAN that's really
exciting to me personally because once
Apple does it other people start taking
it seriously and 10 gig networking is
something that really really needs to
happen down here is where we've got all
of our intake vents all along the bottom
and so this guy must be the exhaust
right over here got your cable
management hole here I really like the
aesthetic of this thing that dark kind
of like I guess this is kind of a Space
Gray or something I don't know what they
what Apple would call it but this dark
aesthetic is really really nice it
screams professional and not in that way
that's like I'm a professional you know
a glossy plastic or something like that
not like it actually looks pro so the
rumor is that Apple has a replacement to
the Mac Pro coming like a proper
replacement like a desktop computer with
a separate monitor and a cable between
them you know like an actual workstation
coming but for the time being this is
the highest end product in their lineup
and as much as that like kind of sucks
because I'm really not a huge fan of the
fact that this gorgeous monitor that I
paid for and this powerful computer that
I also paid for
are just married together forever this
was something I complained about with
the previous 5k iMac the fact that you
can't just use it as a monitor with like
a future Apple desktop but with that
said it's not a terrible looking machine
it's spent a lot of time this holidays
on my knees like not like like playing
card games with my kids and stuff and
once again I am going through the usual
freaking thing that I go through with a
Mac or I don't know how to do anything
SMB colon slash slash no we don't use
back slashes on the Mac we use forward
slashes all right so let's find the test
folder I want to test out that ten
gigabit networking fortunately I have a
10 gigabit switch right here ready to
freakin rock because I am ready for the
10 gigabit revolution here as usual the
screen is gorgeous can never fault Apple
for the display you can fault them for
not remembering what bloody button to
press to make the oh look at it go yeah
it's more brightness than any than any
man needs it's 12 gigs 12 gig file here
we go here we go you guys ready for the
12 gig file to the raid 0 SSD boot drive
look at that go oh it's beautiful it's
not actually that fast pretty fast yeah
I know that's pretty fast so we're doing
like 300 megabytes a second for Apple
people that's really fast
Oh quick times I can't double-click to
make it fullscreen wow I guess I better
go find a hotkey I don't know what it is
Oh am I really gonna make myself use
this thing again for all my software
frustrations though I mean if you run
Windows on it this is the sexiest
Windows all-in-one that's for sure so
let me know guys this is just an
unboxing but we're gonna have a review
coming at least I want to take a look at
the upgrade experience as well it's got
a Vegas
six in it so I'd love to look at the
gaming experience too but let us know in
the comments on this video what you guys
want to hear from us about the Mac maybe
another really interesting piece would
be building out a top-of-the-line iMac
pro so we've actually got some spare
chips that we could upgrade it with we
could get this pretty close to full spec
and then how it would compare price-wise
to a top-of-the-line PC workstation
something like this this thing can take
up to two Xeon processors so I want to
hear from you guys after I tell you
about tunnel bear tunnel bear is the
simple to use VPN app that allows you to
browse privately and enjoy a more open
Internet
so with tunnel bear turned on whether
you're using Wi-Fi like a pleb or you're
using a high-speed 10 gigabit hard line
connection your browsing is kept private
from your ISP from advertisers or anyone
who's looking to track your online
activity and profit from your data
another benefit of tunnel bear VPN is
the ability to get around pesky geo
restrictions that block access to
certain content or services based on
where you are browsing from you just hit
the thing boom you say I want to be from
