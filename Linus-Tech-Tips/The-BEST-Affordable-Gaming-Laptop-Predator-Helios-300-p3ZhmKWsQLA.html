standpoint the Acer predator Helios 300
absolutely crushes any gaming laptop
that we've looked at before but in order
to get the same basic gaming specs as a
$1,900 razorblade into a laptop for only
$1,100 what other sacrifices did they
have to make lots it turns out but that
doesn't mean that it's a bad product
either browse privately and securely
with tunnel there the simple VPN app try
tunnel bear for free at the link in the
video description we were pleasantly
surprised by the predator Helios 300
when first opening it up we brushed
aluminium on the back of the display and
the palm rest of the keyboard gives the
laptop an unexpectedly premium feel and
the rigidity of the chassis helps here
as well it certainly looks the part of a
gaming laptop with red accents it's not
terribly subtle but in my opinion it
doesn't go over the top in its
attention-seeking behavior there are
areas like around the screen and the
bottom where materials like plastic
reigned supreme and it doesn't have the
reassuringly solid feel of something by
Alienware but it avoids feeling cheap so
I'm willing to forgive that to type a
USB 2 s and the type a and type C USB 3
+ Ethernet HDMI 2.0 and even a full
sized SD card slot adds up to pretty
good i/o but what's more than pretty
good maybe even fantastic are the
internal specs of this shockingly potent
little devil with a 6 gig GTX 1060 a
core i7 7700 HQ and 16 gigs of DDR 4
memory at just over a thousand bucks
this was legitimate
the first time like I play this game
I'll guess how much something costs when
I go around to people's booths at trade
shows this was the first time in years
that I was shocked to see the price tag
on a laptop now obviously there are
differences here but for the pieces of
hardware that actually affect gaming
performance the Acer Helios on paper is
the same as much more expensive
competing products but how about the
experience well let's put it this way
you won't have to worry about having to
set a game at anything lower than high
since this thing has no problem pinning
the framerate at the 60 Hertz refresh
rate of the display so no surprises here
it turns out that whether you cram 370
horsepower into a charger or a two-door
Civic it's going to move pretty fast and
it's a bit on the chubby side at 31
millimeters but unlike some of the
sleeker and more expensive gaming
machines we've seen under load the
Helios is able to stay nice and cool
without becoming overly loud either it
even sports a pretty decent webcam but
not all is hunky-dory to have an IPS
screen on a budget oriented gaming
laptop at all should be the icing on the
cake and it does have one whoa but how
do I put this delicately it's kind of
like a grocery store cake where you bite
into it expecting homemade cream cheese
icing and you end up with some canned
Betty Crocker that's a little past is
best before I mean to be cleared the
viewing angles in contrast ratio are
great it's still icing you just regret
asking for a corner piece maximum
brightness could be better described as
maximum glow eNOS and average Delta e
values of five point six seven are only
okay if you don't see huge outliers and
you're covering more than 67 percent
of the sRGB color space I don't want to
sound ungrateful here I still wouldn't
personally trade it for a TN I'm just
saying that you won't be doing any
serious video editing or Photoshop
unless you want to invest in a secondary
monitor to check your work another area
that Acer skimped is the 48 watt hour
battery to their credit acer was at
least honest about this but with this
kind of showing in our standard battery
test basically if you're carting one of
these around to class you should expect
to be getting familiar with the power
outlet locations the trackpad those are
returned to things that are pretty good
it's accurate and tap to click and
gestures work well but I do wish that
the force required to press was a little
less so that dragging and dropping files
is easier and the keyboard feels pretty
good too again the force to press the
keys is a little too high and they are
touch mushy so I can't get quite as fast
as I could on something like an
alienware or the surface laptop which is
a bummer because on a gaming laptop
quick and accurate key presses are plus
but overall it does the job it needs to
and the inclusion of both a backlight
and a full number pad are appreciated
and the positives don't end there it's
the 250 gig SATA SSD which can be
upgraded to nvme by the way isn't quite
enough to house your gaming collection
adding up to 32 gigs of ram or a two and
a half inch hard drive on the Helios
who's really easy each of those has its
own compartment on the bottom so it only
takes one screw to access it should be
noted though that anything beyond that
requires a full disassembly so then in
response to our original question what
you're giving up is screen and battery
so if you want a laptop for productivity
and you just want a game on it a little
bit I'd go for something at this price
point with a gtx 1050 TI a Core i5 and
potentially nearly double the battery
life but if you want a machine that is
laser focused on price
to performance for gaming at just over
$1,000 the predator Helios 300 knocks it
out of the park highly recommended it's
on fire it's not amazing I can't believe
they're testing that right now
