will be sort of in the form of an
unboxing because this inside here is my
package it's pretty big takes a lot of
tape to wrap it up but you know what can
I say it's you know you don't get to
pick your package you just have to make
do with the one you've got and this is
what sent to me by mountain mods it is
mighty jo7
inside here and I had underestimated how
difficult it was going to be to cut this
box open it has been powder-coated and
it is ready for assembly so I'm so
stoked because as slick is so fond of
reminding me it has been a year since I
have actually had a properly built
working gaming desktop over a year thank
you slick
we'll be back once all right there we go
I managed to get all the tape removed
and oh wow there is another box with
more tape says black wrinkle which is
the finish that I opted for for my TJ o7
there's a lot of you guys who have
questioned why I'm sort of staying loyal
to this TJ o7 that between the initial
cost and having it painted twice now and
having the original paint stripped off
so that I could repaint it and make it
look all gorgeous and fresh again has
probably cost me nearly a thousand
dollars I was a gift from my wife
it was one of the first gifts she ever
got me and also I liked it I it's
cheaper than buying a new TJ o7 and
getting that powder coated so there's a
number of reasons why I would want to do
it this way so Mountain mods charged me
two hundred and fifty bucks for getting
everything powder coated and shipped
back to myself and they have wrapped
everything in their customary sort of
what
this would be called cling-wrap like
giant industrial clean wrap their black
wrinkle finish is so gorgeous like out
of all the paint finishes that I've
encountered on computer cases or just
sort of in general this has to be my
favorite I did think about doing
something like an automotive finish on
the outside but like I said few things
compared to sexy black wrinkle black
wrinkle finish so these are the anodized
aluminum side panels and I'm just going
to go ahead and for that oh I'm not
going to go ahead and sort of anything
but let's see how quickly we you know
what we're just going to have to unpack
this off-camera here guys and we'll be
back alright so we unboxed it and other
than a few blemishes which I am of
course going to show you all of because
this system is my baby and so I was a
little bit disappointed to find any of
them although with a project this big
with no do-overs
what what powder coaters would normally
do is they would just throw out the
blemished piece because it's so
expensive to strip powder coating and
then they just redo another one but they
don't have that option because this is
sort of all one-shot deal so there's a
small blemish here on the bottom left
corner I don't know if you can see that
diesel yeah Diesel's got it there's a
blemish on the top which is here where
there's a little bit too much paint
buildup you got that one
okay diesel can't even see it so that
should give you guys some idea how much
of a nitpicker I'm being about this the
oh the grills turned out fantastic so
these are an tech 900 grills and I had
them powder coated black wrinkled so
that they're going to match the case
perfectly now whereas before they just
had the stock non wrinkle powder coating
and then I had an anodized finish here
so now these are going to look extremely
sharp so there will be radiators or
there will be a radiator and fans behind
that so that's going to look really
really clean right there I had the I had
the back piece done all as one piece so
the screws are all installed I'm never
going to install two power supplies in
it installing two power supplies in a
modern
system is totally pointless because you
can get like 1500 watt power supplies
and you'd be hard-pressed to to build a
system that sucks more than 1500 watts
in a standard ATX form factor okay so
here there's a there's some some
blemishes like this one here probably
one of the ones that bothers me most I
think is the one on this side panel
where yeah it's this one you can see
here that there's some like something
going on here yeah but again like I say
not the end of the world and from some
angles you can't even really see it and
at least it's the other side panel the
windowed side panel is quite clean slick
asked me why send it to mountain mods
why not just get any shop to do it learn
the reasons I like having Mountain mods
do it is their PC guys so they
understand that standoffs need to be
masked they understand which holes don't
need to be masked so you can see one of
the things they do is there's uh there's
a rubber piece here that they put in in
order to prevent any kind of paint from
getting into the threads here so they
put these all over the place and they
just they know what they're doing they
know their way in or in and around a PC
so that's why I'm more comfortable
having them work on it but so you can
see the motherboard tray has been
modernized with a CPU cutout as well as
cable management holes and I think
that's pretty much it so hopefully the
next time you guys see a video for me
about my personal rig I will be doing
either either a live stream or of just a
video of me building it oh this is one
little finishing touch that I'm really
really pleased about so I had them do
the hold-down plate for my limited
edition gold-plated Apogee HD in black
wrinkle as well so that's going to be
just a kind of an awesome centerpiece to
have on the in the middle of the
motherboard thank you for checking out
