the usefulness of video card back plates
in a shocking surprise to no one the
thermal benefit was marginal if anything
at all so then when EVGA called us up
inviting us to check out their
top-secret icx technology that was going
to solve video card thermal issues we
had to wonder I mean is this just
another case of gluing on more bloody
fans and back plates or is it a
worthwhile innovation the phoenix auteur
is a full-sized minimalistic li designed
keyboard complete with Cherry MX
switches and a new white backlit variant
check it out at the link below what the
crap is icx technology how do I even
pronounce that I sigh 6i6 well whatever
EVGA is marketing team helpfully
describes it as a new and more efficient
way to cool with optimized airflow fin
design which is a good start because an
old and less efficient way to cool with
an unauthorized airflow fin design would
raise a lot of questions essentially
what it boils down to is this rather
than try to sell us a revolutionary fan
blade design or whatever it's more about
data icx relies on nine discrete thermal
sensors to dramatically expand the cards
monitoring capabilities so in addition
to the GPU we now get readings for each
Bank of vram and the power delivery
modules the cooler can then take
advantage of this sensor data to
intelligently cool the entire card as
needed to the point of independently
controlling its two fans if let's say
the GPU temps would allow a normal card
to spin down but the rear portion of the
card was still hot pretty cool concept
and they've tacked on every other
feature that they can think of as well
like the perforated heatsink fins
low-power fans for additional GPU power
to budget really you guys and a back
plate that EVGA says helps with cooling
a claim that seems to be in vogue these
days all of this of course culminating
in the bold statement play longer
overclock better so how do we test these
claims in our possession is a brand new
EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 super clock 2 with
an all-metal design with a diecast
backplate a clean industrial aesthetic
the aforementioned perforated heatsink
fins and of course I see X as a super
clocked card this sits in the middle of
EVGA x' line up with a 100 megahertz
bump over the reference design and we'll
be running it on our RGB test bench so
it's a core i7 7700 k at both out of the
box and overclocked speeds time for the
fuzzy donut of death yes fir marks back
and so are the settings from the
backplate bench's stock settings save
from a mac style power and temperature
targets the results well that's
unsurprisingly the first interesting
aspect of the IC X design there are a
lot of them for the GPU it was stable at
68 degrees centigrade while the memory
came in at 80 and the power delivery hit
81 all of this with no thermal
throttling traditional tools like fur
marks integrated GPU temperature readout
would have only shown us the 68 degree
figure which means that already icx is
doing its job so then we gave it a tidy
100 megahertz overclock to both core and
memory keeping in mind of course that
the super clock 2 is already overclocked
out of the box and went back to Tim
Hortons for another fuzzy donut and 68
degrees centigrade on the GPU 84 the
memory and 81 for the power delivery
again zero throttling I'm noticing a
pattern here the super clock too icx is
a good card and measures up well to the
ars that we checked out recently but
this sensor tech just doesn't really
seem to do anything for performance
duress
li and under normal conditions both fans
go full blast when the cards working
hard and sit idle when you leave it for
a while so why did they bother
developing this where could it make a
difference well there are a couple of
situations one of which we caught on our
thermal camera naturally because the
independently controlled fans spin up
and down based on the temperatures in
their corresponding zones the total time
each fan needs to stay spun up can be
optimized for a quicker return to quiet
operation so with precision we can see
the temperatures winding down and the
respective fans slowing down after we
close a 3d application situation number
two is less to do with acoustics and
more to do with longevity not every
video card enjoys the luxury of an open
test bench or a full ATX tower and hot
recycled air or air flow restrictions in
smaller cases could lead to higher
temperatures for the vrm reducing its
efficiency hurting performance and
shortening its lifespan so with our
obstruction in the way of this fan we
can see some car temperature's rising
even when the GPU is not being stressed
this is a likely scenario in a compact
case and icx ramps the fan accordingly
cool literally in our perfect world
there is still some work to be done here
independent control of the fans curves
is neat but a robust implementation of a
feature EVGA is teasing right now that
would allow other system coolers to be
controlled as well would allow us to for
example point a side panel fan at the
cards backplate which reached a toasty
74 degrees Celsius in our tests back
plates don't normally contribute to
video card cooling much if at all but in
this manner it's possible that it could
so what do you guys think then would you
pay extra for more temperature sensors
do you appreciate the extra control let
us know in the comments below
synergy is really freaking cool
it basically works like magic okay it's
not magic it's complicated software
engineering but the end result seems
like magic you can share one Mouse and
one keyboard between two computers so
you no longer have to think about like
oh do I need to do something on that one
or that one
no you just drag the mouse from one to
the other end
boom you're switched it's amazing and it
gets even better you can actually do it
between computers with completely
different operating systems Windows
Linux Mac you can drag a single mouse
across them it's amazing they've got a
basic and a pro option with one-time
payment for lifetime access and the
features include even advanced stuff
like clipboard sharing between the
computers so check it out you can use
our link in the video description to get
25% off synergy today so thanks for
watching guys dislike or like
accordingly get subscribed and if you
really like the video check out the link
to where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also down there is
a link to our t-shirt store as well as
our community forum which you should
totally join now that you're done doing
that stuff you're probably wondering
what to watch next so click on a little
featured video that we have I guarantee
you'll be awesome like totally awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
