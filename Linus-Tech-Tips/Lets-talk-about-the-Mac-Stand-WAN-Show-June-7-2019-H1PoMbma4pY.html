oh yeah we've got a little bit too much
Headroom
do you mind that's good yeah
and we're live ladies and gentlemen
welcome a to the LAN show Luke is
cavorting about in Asia so he couldn't
join us but that's ok we have budget
Luke sorry is it discount Luke sorry
cavort John port dance around excitedly
I hope he's cavorting yeah oh I'm pretty
sure he's cavorting he loves hanging out
over there I'm pretty sure that's the
only reason that he wanted to go to
Computex Luke if you're watching I'm on
to you it's the only time he cavorts yes
the time he avoids I rarely cavort but
when I do it's in Asia he actually can't
really come for it over there because a
lot of the time the ceilings are too low
oh I thought you'd say he would like to
squish people step on them he really
does stand there get back I'm cavorting
in a very real way so yeah we've got a
really great show for you guys today and
I'd love to tell you about it except my
laptop is updating so maybe James can
tell us what some of the great topics we
have are we're gonna talk about our
favorite things from WWDC I actually do
have some favorite things from WWDC like
not everything was bad ok no spoilers
though ok and remember when YouTube was
down last weekend we do remember when
the LAN show was supposed to go up last
weekend there's lots of things
conspiracy and AMD and Samsung partner
up for ultra low power graphics and
possibly mobile phones all that and more
at 11 News at 11:00 roll the intro
this is great I just like the timing
someone messages how rich is Linus in
the chat and someone super chats $0.99
not so much that he doesn't appreciate
this it's actually less than 99 cents
because YouTube takes a cut of that oh
they taken how to super chat course they
do how much it's not like 30% no I think
it's more than that yeah I actually
don't know super chats while we
definitely appreciate people's
generosity are not really a needle mover
for us and part of it is that YouTube
does take a significant portion of it so
super Chat YouTube portion sorry I have
to look this up because I actually don't
know
how much money does YouTube take from
super chats this is an article on stream
geeks and I should probably be looking
it up on my laptop now that it's not
updating anymore and then I could
actually share this with you we are
directing all the super shots to Brandon
now no that was just that one time hey
Brandon you got your free lunch right
okay good just checking those super
traps move the needle for you guys
please continue super chats please god
he got a free he got a free lunch out of
it so that's pretty good I can ice all
right how much money does YouTube take
from super chat wow this is a really
long article for just like search on
dollar sign or search on percent control
f you have seen our 100% YouTube live
super truck blah blah blah okay when I
click the estimated revenue and
YouTube's analytics it was roughly
thirty percent less than the total super
chat amount so they take a 30 percent
cut of Super chats through YouTube
that's exorbitant well yes and no its
exorbitant hold on a second yes and no
it's not quite that simple because for
one thing Google while they do use their
own payment processor which saves them a
lot if they were using a third-party
payment processor you could be looking
at as much as 30 cents or more per
transaction plus a percentage of the
transaction so even if I was just using
stripe or Braintree to take a dollar
from you over the Internet
thank you very much I would still be
giving 30% of that over 30% of that to
my payment processor this is something
that we've learned the hard way as we've
developed floatplane
Luke's not here so we're not going to
talk about floatplane attend today but
my apologies to the floatplane fans out
there only blockchain can save us well
save us blockchain yeah but the
transactions aren't even Freeth with
crypto like some crypto currencies have
very high transaction fees especially if
you want the transaction to go through
in a reasonable amount of time yes I
know it depends but the some of the more
commonly used ones have extraordinarily
high transaction fees whatever man it's
the future all right it's it's hard to
have a real conversation but then I mean
you don't cost as much as Luke so it's
discount conversation I don't okay no
one wants to have a blockchain
conversation right now I just want to
make the joke and leave it okay that
that's fair you know uh bitcoins up what
like 60% this year though
last I checked it was is it like 10
grand I don't I don't know honestly I'm
like now we're having a blockchain
conversation I'm I'm out it's 8 grand
it's 8,000 US dollars so I'm I'm out I
don't care anymore
so I'm actually trying not to pay too
close attention to it I'm just like you
know what forget it you guys enjoy your
crypto thing call me when it's actually
manageable to integrate as a payment
system call me when you know the
Canadian banks and the Canadian
government have all decided on a way to
deposit and withdraw this stuff and not
have everything disappear mysteriously
in a weird town in India where people
are known for going to fake their own
deaths you heard about that right the
specific one no um so what's the what's
the crypto exchange that went down the
one that was like based out of here
uh what was that called I don't know
they all have the same name
out of business owner died quadriga yeah
quadriyyah
so it's a 30 year old CEO and co-founder
died of complications arising from
crohn's disease while traveling in India
supposedly except the circumstances of
his death are spurious all right yeah
but did that ever come to a conclusion I
don't believe it has at this point but I
haven't been paying really close
attention to it because like I said I'm
out
I hope he's alive I really do I like
over a hundred million dollars of assets
like are you saying you've never
fantasized those faking your own death
it's a sick funny thing to think about
it's illegal as far as I know isn't it I
think it is yeah I mean you know the
thing is that you know most of the
people who do it you know never get
prosecuted because they're actually dead
I love how there's like a mecca for this
like if you want to fake your death come
here how can you have a good fake if
everyone knows oh he died in that town
no one really dies there like their
whole newspapers obituaries like big
news yeah so I don't know like there's a
place there's a place there I forget
what the town is called or like like the
area is called but they're really well
known for document forgeries including
things like birth certificates and death
certificates and that happened to be and
this could be a tinfoil hat conspiracy
theory in fact YouTube chat is probably
blowing up being like I personally oh
wow it is blowing up like I personally
saw the dead body or whatever like good
for you so yeah like I said it's
possible this is all nonsense it's a hub
for makeup artists but it's it's
possible someone says not illegal you
have the right to disappear yeah you can
disappear but you can't you can't forge
a death certificate because that is a
legal document so that would be about
like forging a land deed like you can't
do that and because there are such large
incentives for some people for faking
their own death there's definitely
definitely
is that not make it so you can't do that
faking your death is sometimes called
pseudo side pseudo sigh that is great I
like that that's that's lever Wow
well don't know if it's illegal or not
yet but how about Apple stuff how about
it how about it alright well why don't
we why don't we bring up the WWDC news
and kind of kind of talk through some of
our the wind or favorite things the land
dock why would I go to the weather's the
links therein I know but the people who
work on that they just don't do a very
good job it's funny cuz he's the one who
works on the window alright alright
alright alright so there's like nothing
in here I said follow the links the
links your I didn't build this out
because you already made videos about
this you know this we all know this
stuff alright
so should we start with the Mac Pro now
I've kind of said everything that I want
to say about the Mac Pro I there oh
actually I do have a couple small
Corrections from the video that I made
earlier this week so I had speculated
that the the very low end system
configurations that only have four
sticks of memory might not support six
channel memory right I remember right
after the Mac Pro announcement we missed
it Intel announced their 3000 series
Xeon w lineup that was going to be the
processors in the Mac Pro and it does go
all the way down to eight cores and
Apple apparently confirmed that no there
will only be one motherboard so they're
just shipping a 6 channel motherboard 6
channel CPU and they're just putting
four sticks of memory in it because 6
grand for a an 8 core processor makes a
ton of sense
no from like an optimization standpoint
well what does that mean well it means
that you're getting effectively 66% of
the memory bandwidth that you otherwise
would now with that said you've only got
a piddly 8 core processor so who cares I
guess because it's not like it's not
like a 28 core where you could
legitimately have a workload you're
running on it that needs all of that
memory bandwidth like you just don't
have the come
pew to justify it anyway but I also just
don't think that an eight-core
configuration of this machine should
exist it doesn't make sense like so much
of the price of this thing is making up
for the R&amp;amp;D of the case design it seems
to me that you're just not getting any
value on the on the low-end on the
low-end I think there's people already
defending it but I don't I don't
understand these people because on the
low-end you should just be buying a
latest gen iMac it has an 8 core
processor
ECC memory it's a really it's a really
interesting feature because I even went
as far so we published a very negative
review of intel's previous xeon w lineup
the one that was based on their LGA 2066
platform and what Anthony and I
concluded and I ultimately said in the
video was these things are a rip by an
ad DT processor because the only
differentiating factor is that they
support ECC memory which if you really
needed it while AMD supports ECC up and
down their entire lineup all the way
from thread Ripper down to Rison 3 so if
you absolutely must have that there
might be an AMD option for you go check
that out and you lose overclocking
support which depending on your workload
might actually make sense because you're
using their c6 20 whatever chipset
instead of their ex 299 chipset which
has overclocking support built into it
so we ultimately concluded that you were
paying anywhere from 500 and over
dollars for a trade-off in features that
may or may not have any value to you and
Intel was upset about my conclusion
because they said well actually you know
Xeon w is good for workstations and I
went why is it good and they said well
because it's made for workstations and I
said well what makes it made for
workstations exactly and they said well
it has DCC support and I said well
that's nice
what does that do for me because here's
the thing the perception for a lot of
years was that in
xeon processors were somehow better than
their consumer equivalents and there
have been times when they actually were
but over time the rd cost to make a new
CPU design has become such an enormous
part of the cost of a processor that by
the time you've done all that R&amp;amp;D it's
actually cheaper to just make the same
cpu and put it under two different
brands with some features turned on or
turned off and a feature that you would
turn off would never be stability like
you does not think about it it is not an
intel's interest for their core series
processors to crash once every four
hundred and twenty two hours to what end
so intel can talk about how xeon w is
really stable but if you ask well is
core i nine not stable they just kind of
yeah it's stable and it is so what i
asked them to do was okay guys let's
talk about ECC i want to do a video
where you guys take me to like you know
Sandia National Lab or something and and
we we we simulate a solar a solar event
we flip a bit we actually flip a bit on
a memory chip and show that this system
recovered from it and this one didn't
and they were like we can't do that like
they physically can't do that they don't
have the instruments to do that they
wouldn't clarify okay they were just
like we can't do that
and so I said well then my conclusion
about your processor given that there is
no meaningful demo I also lied before we
got as far as like going to a laboratory
and like doing this I asked well give me
a demo give me something I could do on
two machines that shows that this one is
more stable than this one and they were
like we don't have any workload like
that I kind of went okay thanks guys
like the thing you gotta understand is
that ECC does do something in the event
of an accidental bit flip it is supposed
to recover from it
the thing is that each subsequent
generation of ddr technology has also
added more resiliency against accidental
errors so I'm not saying it doesn't have
a value today I'm just saying that it's
not a value that even Intel was able to
design a test for me to be able to
demonstrate this the people I talked to
there if anyone from Intel is watching
and knows a way that we can do this
yo hm new as the kids say right I'm
almost as old as you now man yeah and
you're gonna be wait is that public
knowledge or no that's okay and he's
gonna be a dad too
yeah he's gonna be the second dad at
Linus Media Group I was gonna say second
parent but my wife works here she's also
a parent that's true she's very obvious
she's a parent oh that was great
oh I'm gonna let that wash over me for a
second yeah so it's like a feature that
is over serving those people and being
disrupted by the same companies other
features yes anyway I forget where I was
going with this right you should just
buy an iMac because it's a faster eight
core even thermal throttling I think
it's still faster than this that's Z on
W because yeah whatever or something and
then that even ignores the iMac Pro
which starts at 5 grand and I think what
does what does its core count start at I
feel like we need to go like look at
that now my Mac Pro Apple USA I don't
think this is going to take me to the US
site no it's not well whatever we'll
just do it manually thank you very much
for that you know what the prices I love
how this stuff you know me the price no
I do need the prices because the
the Mac Pro is gonna start at 6 grand so
if we have a look at where the iMac Pro
starts because remember these are not
the same processors they fit in an
entirely different socket but from a
performance standpoint I don't believe
Intel has changed anything like a clock
speed for clock speed core for core they
should be quite similar so let's go
ahead and have a peekaboo at what we get
for this so we got a 3.2 gig of
gigahertz Xeon w that turbos to 4.2 and
what do we get the Mac Pro we got a 3.5
that turbos to 4.0 so let's configure it
we've got a grand to spend because they
both come with 32 gigs of ram in the
base configuration and to know this one
has a 1 terabyte SSD out of the box of
course it does right so we can add
another 2 frickin course and I'm not
saying the iMac Pro is a perfect machine
I'm just saying it also happens to
include a display with a stand and it'll
all perform the base model Mac Pro on
paper we will have to actually test that
we might have to crack open our iMac pro
again
oh stop cracking it put like different
processes of cracking it please oh I
know I know
I think the graphics card is the most
embarrassing thing about this stock
configuration really a 580 X let's fire
up the new egg comm now I know it's a
Radeon Pro or whatever but you guys got
to understand that is a they'll just
bend that's it no that is just a driver
switch that AMD flips it is the same
bloody card 5 ATX hold on typing yeah
I'm working on it I'm working on it so
what is a 5 ATX cost these days here's
an msi Armour whatever $200 like we're
talking at a $200 graphics card in a
system that costs 6 grand so basically
the message that Apple is sending with
this base configuration is by this if
you're the kind of like ego image is
everything
moron that wants to have a Mac Pro as a
status
symbol but actually doesn't care at all
about what's under the hood of it at all
yeah that's the message it's like being
like oh I need a Mercedes to impress the
ladies and everyone else is like yeah
it's the cheapest one yes but as long as
the ladies don't know that I guess
you're good then you're good so as long
as it's cheese ladies who aren't into
cars
what else did I did I want to say about
the Mac Pro right okay so we know it's
all the same socket so no you don't get
a different motherboard it's just stupid
now I've had people say well what if you
want to upgrade in the future well then
you should use your current machine for
now and you should upgrade when you
order because upgrading computers is
very rarely a good idea now I'm not
saying you should get the you know most
loaded out memory configuration in fact
there's a good chance that companies
like Oh WC or iFixit are gonna have kits
that you can use to upgrade that stuff
for much cheaper I'm just saying that
you're basically buying a processor that
you then are just gonna put in a bin and
trust me no one else is gonna want it
because the kind of motherboard that's
gonna fit in LGA 3647 xeon w is gonna
cost five hundred six hundred dollars
nobody buys a board like that and puts a
cheapo eight core processor in it that's
stupid it's an imbalanced machine that's
my point it's six grand it's got a
throwaway processor a throwaway graphics
card and memory that honestly let's see
it's 32 gigs so what is that so that 8
gig sticks so that limits your total
upgrade ability as well because it's
only got 12 memory slots so 32 times 3
is what like 96 96 gigs of ram like
that's probably Lots but you're better
off getting 16 gig sticks because that
doubles the overall expansion like if
upgrade ability is what you've got in
mind
don't buy parts that you have to throw
away and that no one will ultimately
want so why do you think Apple makes
this skew they make this skew for the
for the ego people do you think it's
it's their most profitable build oh no
no I think they're just because people
will buy
I think that they are trying to maintain
not just a profit margin but also a GP
dollars profitability to this product
because my dream by GP dollars gross
profit dollars okay so so they just want
to have covers as as wide a swath of the
market as possible yeah so so they want
to hit the lowest price point they can
while still making what they would have
expected to make regardless of which SKU
they sell on the core components that
they're selling which are ultimately the
case a licence for mac OS which is
ultimately tied to the main board the
sorry the logic board but if that's the
case then this and if this product is
over lapping with performance wise with
the other products as you just showed us
then it's cannibalizing those other
products to me that doesn't make sense
unless it's the case that at Apple those
teams are kind of segregated and each
team is responsible for getting is it's
much gross profit on its product line I
actually have and they're competing
teams
I doubt it works that way I think apples
a little bit smarter and a little bit
more organized than that I suspect that
the only reason they wouldn't care about
this cannibalizing their other products
is that it's more profitable or as
profitable so ultimately it doesn't
matter what you buy okay and I would
suspect based on the load out of
something like an iMac Pro I suspect
that this is a higher margin product
even if they are assembling it in the US
as I think they had committed to doing
don't quote me on that though okay so
yeah they just have a they just have a
base amount of GP dollars that they need
to make in order to make this product
make sense for their shareholders and
well screw you you get to buy a config
that doesn't make any sense
because remember to imagine this imagine
if it didn't start at 6,000 okay imagine
if it started at 12 13,000 okay people
would be outraged about that too and
instead of it just being nerds like me
that are gonna break down the spec and
go well this is imbalance this doesn't
make sense
you know you've effectively you
effectively bought you know that xform a
case that we showed the like $1,300 case
and you know put an entry-level CPU and
graphics card in and like you're an
idiot you know but the people who are
mad right now are the giant nerds
whereas if they announced a product that
was that started at $13,000
everyone would be right there they're
like common customer would feel
alienated that's right yeah okay now it
seems attainable even though what you're
buying is essentially stuff to throw
away and upgrade later if you are
intending to do any serious work with it
okay how would the monitor though oh
yeah we can talk about the monitor so I
can't wait to see it it's gonna be a
great monitor let's say that it's gonna
be a great monitor oh the monitor I'm
pretty excited about actually now
Brandon was actually telling me about um
a really interesting post that someone
created where their main problem with
the monitor was not necessarily its
hardware capabilities but whether or not
apple was going to adhere to any of the
existing standards for HDR because if
Apple comes in and says okay we're
competing with the the Flanders of the
world you know we're talking thirty
thousand plus dollar displays so this
person's problem with it at that point
was it doesn't have enough local dimming
zones it's gonna have bloom it's just
it's simply not suitable versus if Apple
was coming in and they wanted to compete
with sort of the the more the more
average creation monitors they were
saying that well Apple needs to Apple
needs to just be aware of and adhere to
standards like HDR 10 that already
exists instead of you know forging their
own path with this but what do they call
it XD our extreme dynamic range or
something like that I can't remember
exactly exactly what their wording was
for it now I I think that with like
Apple isn't perfect but they tend to be
good at designing an end-to-end workflow
what I suspect is that right around the
time this Mac Pro launches there
gonna have some new workflow tools
within Final Cut with in Mac OS that are
going to make working with HDR content
easier and I think that they they're
going to have to acknowledge that there
are standards like hlg HDR 10 Dolby
building vision that already exists and
that they have to make their tools work
for I am NOT as pessimistic as that
person was but I also am not as
well-versed in it as they are so I'm
gonna be really interested to see how
this how this goes and how long this
display is even that interesting for
OLED only has to get a little bit
brighter to make more sense because
remember it's high dynamic range not
necessarily how many nits you can pump
through a display so all that only has
to get a little bit brighter before for
my for myself I'd rather be editing I'd
rather be creating on something that has
no bloom and 570 is 576 zones 532 I
can't remember how many it was but
32-inch yeah that's a lot of zones on a
32-inch
but it's sure as heck not an emissive
display technology I actually we checked
out a display with 512 512 zones just on
a 35 M on a 35 inch and so it's not
quite an apples to apples comparison but
would you say based on what you saw that
apples 500 to 600 class display on a 32
inch is going to be sufficient for like
real color accurate contrast accurate
color work no it depends on okay well it
depends on the aggressiveness because on
the display that you and I looked at it
was which was the PG 35 B sometimes
known as BQ it has such aggressive local
dimming that there was always bloom and
it was you could really see when you
move the cursor from one little 1 inch 1
inch zone to another that you missed
when we were playing Tomb Raider didn't
you I played it myself earlier but I was
there with you did you play any scenes
with really high contrast a little bit
ok I didn't notice any problems ok
because I
is really impressed with how well it did
when gaming it was only one on the
desktop that sucked on it
I think sucked is probably about the
right word yeah yeah yeah all I'm saying
is like Oh even with that many zones
five hundred zone x' and that size
they're still like that they were about
an inch pretty big it's big yeah and
apples is gonna be smaller but not that
much smaller not that much smaller no
like maybe point eight of an inch like
0.85 of an inch but yeah so cuz remember
- we're talking about a thirty five inch
display but it's a thirty five inch 21
by nine display that is not in terms of
actual display surface area that's not
as much bigger as it sounds compared to
a 32 inch is it sixteen by nine nine or
ten I actually don't remember but even
you even see bloom on oh let's I think
it just has to do with the perception of
the eye though that's true that's true
you do see some blue mono LEDs but like
you said I think part of it is just the
eyes contrast capabilities yeah and
that's actually another thing that's
another reason why I do question how
much brighter OLED really has to get for
the HDR experience to be really really
good on it because we're already at the
point now where the brightest whites on
an OLED right next to the blackest
blacks like my eye has a hard time
seeing that line yeah so if we want
something like a like a candle burning
in the middle of the darkroom if we want
it to bleed out if that's the filmmakers
desired effect
I mean far off I just don't know how
much more work is gonna get be put into
OLED because seems like micro light is
kind of looming in like the three to
five year horizon no and and apples when
the company is doing really heavily as
far as as far as the public is aware
anyway yeah I don't know how big of
displays are playing on making with it
though it's supposed to be pretty
scalable alright that's one of the one
of the selling points of micro light I
believe that it's kind of like you can
just scale it up or down now this was a
really fun conversation that I actually
had with some of the
folks at Nvidia and I don't believe ya
know there's nothing about this that
would have been off the record or nd8 or
anything like that but I was um pardon
my ignorance every once in a while I get
something completely wrong so I was
under the impression that when we talk
about micro LED technology you know what
we really need to do our sponsor spots
but yes we are we are running out of
time on the wind show here today so
don't let let me let me get into that
what a cliffhanger sorry guys I'm not
I'm not I'm not doing this to you just

here ah hello can are we still streaming
I think we're still streaming no you
guys can't see but Lance is trying to
kiss me right now
lights are turning on in the bedroom
right now lights are on behind me
cameras on now I kind of like this dark
mode yeah sorry these lights take a
little bit to turn back on guys anyway

booked through our affiliate link at LM
GGG /when rover to get $10 off for first
time users yeah and they're available in
Canada because one of our people used it
oh really
yeah oh that's cool very cool all right
so let's go what was I talking about
dang it you're about to tell me okay the
thing about micro lid okay so every once
in a while I get something completely
wrong and micro LED is one of them okay
so my first exposure to micro LED in the
real world was Sony's that's pretty hot
that's pretty hot right is there is
there a reason we don't just turn on the
normal
are you sure I don't know if they take
10 minutes I think we'd see them glowing
by now I don't think there are I'm happy
with this it looks cool yeah organic so
my first exposure to micro LED blow I'm
not the one looking in the light was
with the Sony Cledus display yeah and
have you heard of the cleaner yeah
that's es oh did you see it I wasn't
there that year but the head of the next
year didn't okay so the cleanest display
is really trippy because the way that
it's like a modular display and we've
seen technologies like this before but
it's a unique one because it's got these
panels that are about this big and then
you just assemble them together into
whatever size and resolution display you
want now that's not unique what's unique
is that the cleanest display uses an
emissive display technology like OLED
except it's not all it's it's micro LEDs
okay
so they've got these tiny tiny micro
LEDs red green and blue and they emit
directly from the display so there's no
backlight or anything like that but the
way that they achieve near-perfect
blacks on a Cletus display is that I
forget what the exact number is but it's
a flavor made of black dots no no no
it's not like a bunch of black dots that
you can see if you go really close to it
no instead I can illusion when you back
up it's a little bit different than that
though so they actually allowed me to go
up to it here I'm just yeah I remember
everyone was everyone was tense I'm like
no don't go that close okay ultimate
picture bla bla bla
where is it okay here we go okay right
because so the reason they can get
nearly perfect blacks out of it is that
99% of the cletus display doesn't emit
light weird it's just it's actually
black so you're looking at this giant
display made bet that emits light
they're micro LEDs they're super bright
but they're actually tiny they're micro
LEDs and all the area around them is
just
black are they clustered or are they
spread out with lots of black in between
they look like this yeah okay yeah so
you've got a red green and a it's either
a blue or yellow actually I don't
remember but you've got three sub pixels
for each pixel and the vast majority the
display is actually black but because of
the way that light spreads from a source
you actually have to get about 18 inches
from the screen in order for and it's
weird your eyes like go weird as you
move through the threshold kind of click
in and then all of a sudden you go from
seeing the entire image which has no
perceivable gaps in it to seeing just
these dots and they don't look like
anything they just it's so weird
okay so I thought that micro LED
displays were specifically this
technology okay I didn't ever stop and
think about that a micro LED is just a
small LED and you could do anything you
wanted with it yeah I didn't think about
that there were other ways that people
were planning to use micro LEDs okay so
I was talking to Nvidia because they
were talking about these displays that
bave that they've created with over 500
local dimming zones and they were
talking about like yeah you know we see
a clear path forward because which
NVIDIA displays have over 500 beginnings
well the one that we just checked out
for one that's not Nvidia I'm talking
about the Nvidia driver module and the
the fuller a backlight control module
that's videos okay yeah so okay that's
actually an important point to clarify
so they were talking about how you know
going from 384 zones to over 500 zones
to using many LEDs to micro LEDs they
see this very clear technology
progression whereas like I'd love an
OLED g-sync display and I was like hey
you guys working on that and they're
kind of like you know they're vague
right they're evasive we're working on
everything you know what are we're a
technology company what are we not
working like they basically there's a
not total non-answer
when I drilled down where I ultimately
like they wouldn't answer any questions
about it but what I ultimately realized
is that because OLED is an emissive
display with completely different
characteristics in terms of color mixing
at different brightnesses you know
making them color accurate the way that
the pixels switch or rather they don't
take a long time to switch like Nvidia
would have to completely reinvent the
desync module I see to run an OLED
display so when they were talking about
this clear path forward to mini LED and
micro LED I totally misunderstood that
they were talking about something like a
cleanest display an emissive display
using micro LEDs what they were actually
talking about was using micro LEDs to
have a much greater degree of
granularity in a full array backlit IC
okay so so what they're looking for as a
business then is is evolution rather
than revolution it's like we have this
tried and tested stuff we just need to
iterate to make it you know just do this
but do it harder so it's smaller
mid-drive it so what I ultimately came
away with was that full array back
lighting on LCD displays is not going
anywhere
and where we're probably headed is many
many many more zones maybe where we get
to the point where each zone is a mini
LED or a micro LED so that the blooming
becomes much less I don't remember what
my point was in all of this anymore I
think we were just talking about micro
light coming out eventually oh yes so
micro LED coming out eventually yes but
maybe not in the form that you might
think because a micro LED display could
be an emissive display or it could just
be really really small LEDs micro LEDs
mm-hmm behind a regular old LCD panel
so yes micro LED displays are coming we
just don't know exactly what form
they'll take and after that meeting with
NVIDIA better understand extense to keep
them as
transmissive displace because when you
have that many other well it depends on
when you have if there are almost the
level of being like for each pixel is a
zone then the beauty of it is that you
turn it off and you get the black levels
of OLED yes right and the picture
response times because the reason that
LCDs have higher pixel response times
than all that is that actually crystal
to twist that takes time and to untwist
yes and that's also related to why it's
not as black because even when it's
fully twisted some lights still gonna
get through so why would you give up on
all those awesome benefits because
you've invested the last 25 years in LCD
then get disruptive and do you know how
they work get disrupted that but that's
it because you know how they work
because a lot of the time you can build
even using an inferior technology you
can build a better display when you
understand the technology at play better
and so yes get disrupted but the flip
side of that is Apple's display is
already sort of groundbreaking in terms
of its contrast and peak brightness and
all that the thing is the thing is
$6,000 so but so is it be FGD what's the
emissive one gonna be that's exactly my
point how disruptive is that technology
gonna be if it costs 50 grand or
whatever you know what I mean well they
should eventually it depends they could
end up in phones it'd be great in your
watch yes and I wonder if LG I'm sure LG
is also investing in it it's just kind
of interesting because they also are
going so hard into OLED but they don't
want to be the caught flat-footed either
right no one wants to be caught
flat-footed I think LG is still pretty
heavily invested in all that only time
will tell
so we promised in the video thumbnail
that we were gonna talk about not just
the monitor but also the monitor stand
want I understand the one from they
wanted dozens come with yeah but it
doesn't come with so I guess the
argument here is that like the very
expensive very very expensive monitors
that you referenced earlier those don't
come with stands either and it's just
not in like in that category it's not
industry standard to have a standing hey
Brandon can you bring me something
that's really stupidly overpriced like a
handle or something you know you know
what I'm talking about right yeah okay
Brandon's gonna find something gonna be
something related to a red okay so can i
play devil's advocate for a moment here
please
I love Satan okay so there's a you got
something for me okay yeah bat yeah what
else you got how much is this
this is 1295 for two okay wonderful how
much is this is that still how much it
costs us I'm Canadian
okay three grand us all right it's just
three grand
okay so we got it we got a couple we've
got a couple things here okay so when I
buy a product my understanding is that
it should come with pretty much
everything that it needs to function
right okay okay that's a very consumer
centric point of view now I would say
that if I were to if I were to graph out
the now that now that I have experience
in the professional world if I were to
graph out my expectation of like a cost
versus included accessories curve okay I
would say as the cost approaches zero
your included accessories go down you
expect a more bare-bones experience so
the cost approaches zero as the cost of
my original purchase approaches zero so
if I buy the cheapest phone on the
market I'm not that surprised it doesn't
come with some headphones okay right
okay
then as I as I step up in cost
I expect my experience to be more and
more complete and when you buy something
like a galaxy s 10 you know it's got
your
we do theoretically alive but the
camera's dead
can you can you guys can you guys make
sure the camera is gonna turn back on we
just I'm sorry guys we just had we just
had a short blackout let's call it brown
no no it's called a brown out when it
doesn't actually tell when yep I'm a
short blackout yeah Wow we have a good
name for that guys um we're describing
an inverted parabola okay yeah so so
basically you know I expect to get my my
you know my headphones and and they'll
run bundles and stuff so maybe it comes
with a micro SD card for expansion and
it's a fast charger a fast charger you
know like an accessory bundle so unless
its knife own yeah and then as I spend
more that starts going I get into
professional-grade rather than consumer
grade gear the manufacturers expectation
is that if you only have a little bit to
spend you expect very little if you have
a moderate amount of money to spend you
expect a lot and if you have a lot of
money to spend you probably don't care
about the crap we were gonna include
anyway and you're willing to pay more
for a premium perfect option so I think
there's a certain level of F you you've
got the money anyway
pay more that goes on when it comes to
profession I don't think they would say
that I think they would say that they
wouldn't say cuz every because each
piece is ostensibly so highly engineered
and high-quality and so expensive you
don't and low volume you don't want to
be paying for things you don't need that
would be the way they would say it they
wouldn't say a few but it's just implied
but if that were really the case if
they're really being altruistic then
there wouldn't be a $200 base adopter it
would just be standard it you could just
clip it on there yes okay so let's talk
about then so again playing playing a
little bit of devil's advocate here I
don't think that Apple has missed the
mark with their audience at all we are
talking about Asian I think they're
outright outraging the same person they
were afraid of to outrage when we talked
about the lower level I think they're
gonna outrage people but I don't think
those were the customer for this product
at all we're talking about a six
thousand dollar monitor once you get the
anti-glare special etched glass coating
we're talking about a six thousand
dollar machine that it hooks up to at
that point it is an eight percent
difference in cost to get the pro stand
or just or or what percentage is that or
we're talking like a 1.75 percent
difference in cost to get a vase amount
right 1.5 percent that's all we're
talking about $200 nothing people people
who can afford that PE the $200 a grand
not necessarily maybe they don't P it
but maybe they can make that $200 back
because this is a tool that they use for
actual work so I paid how much should I
pay for this the handle 1200 bucks for
two for two a pair is $1200 okay so I
paid $600 for this let's break it down a
little bit here's a piece of machined
aluminum here's a screw here's a little
aluminum doohickey that you can twist
here's a button
another aluminum doohickey here's a
little adjust II do Hickey with another
little do that on it here's a rubber
hose go let's go okay so $600 but I did
this because there's nothing else on the
market that has the the same level of
ergonomics and build quality that allows
us to operate the camera more
comfortably so effectively
I'm not buying some stupid aluminum
doohickey I'm buying a solution I'm
buying a camera operator whose back
doesn't need Kairo appointments every
week that ultimately my company's health
plan is going to pay for that's what I'm
buying so it's a different perspective
and when it comes to legitimate
professional level gear I'm not
talking about an iPad pro that's not
professional equipment a MacBook Pro is
not professional equipment anymore
people are doing real work on them but
Apple has sullied that product line they
have made it about a status symbol that
you can use to browse Facebook hot take
more than just about actually getting
real work done and delivering the best
possible performance now my thoughts may
change when I actually haven't watched
our review of the upcoming eight core
MacBook Pro so I'm basing it on the one
that thermal throttle lasts apparently
it's a lot better but I'm talking about
actual tools that actual professionals
will buy to actually make money with
them it's a different equation when you
make money with something that you buy
all these cognitively you can justify it
sure also if you make more money with it
than objectively mmm-hmm it's a good
investment well hey do you know how much
employee health care costs six hundred
bucks whatever or like or like if
someone quit because I I wouldn't I
would couldn't provide the the ergonomic
equipment that they need to not be in
pain mm-hmm
do you know how much it cost to train a
person mm-hmm we're talking thousands
and thousands of dollars in lost
productivity what this makes them happy
please all right hmm what do I care
look how well I want a better chair
chair do you have now I'm just joking
all right
I have had a really nice Herman Miller
before our work it was pretty cool
should we wrap it up is that in super
chats can we do some super travel we
should really do some super chats just
for YouTube sake yes yes yeah here
YouTube here's your here let's find the
design the most expensive you super
check YouTube can we get so YouTube
here's 30 bucks from time and Doug Dole
hey Linus Paradox Interactive of ck2 eu4
made a music video for their upcoming
paradox Khan will be getting music video
for LTX will we get a music video for
LTX I have to confess I had not given
that one nano
second of the heart well I can imagine
us having footage from LTX placed over
music or with music and released as
promotional material for the next one
but I don't think we're gonna
choreograph any dancing or get any sexy
people in bikinis we could put us in
bikinis is that something I can make
sexy people in bikinis yeah I mean we're
sexy aren't we compared to what Linus pH
prototyping says would you ever consider
fully building an entire production
grade computer case from scratch for a
video in the future
absolutely in fact I mean that would one
are we you okayed the wood the wood case
did I did I okay making it from scratch
no okay actually yeah that is something
that we would consider doing it would
have to be the right project I mean we
have designed cases from scratch before
my personal rig is in a completely
custom-designed case that was built by
proto case Anthony Birk hi Joseph thorny
ER hi Chad hi hey Chad blame the dingus
more free super chat Thank You junior
Andrew moss pack says do you think Apple
will lock out the PCI ports I sincerely
hope that they don't at least not
directly I think what Apple will do is
they will limit the availability of
drivers for devices to ones that they
won't plugged into those PCIe ports just
like they do with the Blackmagic EGP you
exactly just like you can't plug an
Nvidia graphics card into MacBook
because Apple will not okay the drivers
to be clear I actually had someone
complaining in the comments on the mac
pro video where I appeared to be blaming
Apple for the rift between Apple and
Nvidia to be clear I don't
I suspect that between Nvidia and Apple
you've got the two biggest egos in the
entire industry and it's no wonder they
can't get along and is probably equal
parts both of their fault actually it's
probably more invidious fault cuz bait
they screwed Apple pretty good on those
dying GPUs back in the day carpentry
says Canadian dollars for the merge
story please sorry it's not gonna happen
anytime soon the vast majority of our
audience is in the US and the ones that
aren't quite frankly aren't
either and the US dollar is kind of the
international currency Oh
apparently it's Shopify's fault we can't
have multiple currencies on it oh wow we
just call it you made me call out
Shopify and you haven't double-checked
it
dang it Nick so you're saying you're
rich so you don't care no I'm saying
that I use these products to make money
think about it this way you don't you
can apply the same logic to anything as
a as a parent whose kids won't use it
very often I could say $75.00 Radio
Flyer wagon is very expensive and I'm
not gonna buy one but if my if my son
were to say I'm gonna get a job
delivering newspapers I can deliver
newspapers 30% faster with a Radio Flyer
wagon
I could make back that money in seven
days of delivering newspapers now it's
not expensive it costs the exact same
amount of money it's just a matter of
measuring that amount that it costs
against the ROI that it delivers for the
business it's a different calculation it
doesn't necessarily mean that you don't
care about what the cost is it just
means that there are other factors at
play price is an arbitrary metric value
so if your value if you value it
differently that someone else does
because of your circumstances then Scott
says you crashed you tube with last
week's mine show actually this is 2n
shows in a row that they haven't managed
to process correctly so my intention
today is to kill the livestream and then
re-upload it as Avadh they promise me
it's not gonna happen again but they
also couldn't offer an explanation as to
why it happened last week and why it
took an entire week for them to fix it
Tyler gaming says I'm a Linux user haha
I enjoy your very limited suite of
creative professional software like come
on it's not that simple you know that
tommy gun says how's the 100k pc and
personal rig doing my personal rigs
great James helped me upgrade it again
yesterday so I'm super stoked on that
and 100k PC we have a video coming very
soon we shot that this week okay I
I'm gonna call that it thank you very
much ladies and gentlemen and we will
see you again next week same bat-time
same bat-channel
oh I am blurred 20 bucks sorry I will I
will answer you do you know of a 2 &amp;amp; 1
or a convertible laptop with pen support
for drawing that can also game at
approximately medium settings Wow I
wouldn't I wouldn't count on finding
that I would more look for something
that has a good drawing surface that has
Thunderbolt and I would use a neat GPU
when you're when you're gaming like I
don't know what to tell you or I would
wait for oh I would wait for wait what I
would wait for 1/10 Jenna are gonna have
better onboard graphics Alex PA prime
from our editing team a super chat
asking if this is a conflict of interest
sending the super chat what are you even
for two dollars are you even I'm
reporting him I'm putting Messer in

all right bye guys oh wait what the
