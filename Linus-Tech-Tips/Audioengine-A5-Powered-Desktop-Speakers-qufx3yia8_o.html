a five-plus is the last in my five-part
series of speaker reviews that marks my
entry into the category from a review
perspective they're not perfect and
there are still some compromises that
are being made here but there is a lot
to love about this pair of
classic-looking powered desktop speakers
the CM storm SF 17 uses a massive 18
centimeter fan to cool your gaming
notebook and it adds a four port USB hub
click now to learn more because it's a
shorter list then the things I liked I'm
going to start with the things I didn't
like about the number one is the size
the a5 pluses by a wide margin like
literally they're wider than anything
else took up more space on my desk when
I was doing my listening testing than
any of the other solutions they were up
against including the simple audio
listen Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins mm ones both
companion 5s an audio engineer two
pluses whether or not you are able to
consider buying these speakers may
simply come down to whether you have
enough physical space next to your
monitor to fit them number two is the
features or lack thereof compared to
other speakers in this roundup the a5
pluses do not feature bluetooth wireless
music playback or an integrated DAC if
you want to use them with a computer
that has crummy analog output the
redeeming quality here is that at $100
cheaper than some of the lesser sounding
sets on the roundup you can pick up a
DAC or an airport Express for wireless
speaker action or whatever else if you
really wanted to to make up for at least
one of these shortcomings with that
money you saved the third thing I didn't
like about them was the fact that this
short list of dislikes
makes my video a lot shorter than it
otherwise would be and the way I
evaluate my own self-worth is by seeing
how long I can get you guys to listen to
me while I talk about a pair of speakers
that's it everything else fell into the
liked it or was neutral about it because
I felt like it was a fair trade-off
category the build quality is up to the
audio engine standard so great and while
it's right on their site that they don't
claim that the ax+ series are studio
monitors they do borrow design elements
and build quality cues from these
professional-grade products so that's
where we get the
some 5 inch Kevlar woofers and silk dome
tweeters with neodymium magnets that are
mounted in a hand-built MDF cabinets the
custom-built internal electronics and
the satisfying near-field listening
experience from in terms of included
accessories the retailer I bought mine
from threw in some nice thick gauge
speaker wire but Audioengine normally
includes a 12 foot 16 gauge wire to
connect your right speaker to the left
one that contains the amplifier for both
as well as the rest of the i/o and I
guess since we're on the subject here's
all the stuff you'll find back there a
base port that you should keep at least
six inches from anything behind the
speaker a massive heatsink that you
should also keep away from any airflow
impeding obstructions a three-and-a-half
millimeter input jack next to a USB
power output for convenient use with an
mp3 player or phone a standard RCA input
for convenient use with almost anything
else an RCA output for an optional
subwoofer or audio engines own wireless
music sharing dongle the standard
speaker wire outputs to the right
speaker and on/off switch a voltage
select toggle a fuse access cover and
finally an AC power input on the front
of the left speaker you'll find a
thankfully front mounted volume knob I
mean seriously what were they thinking
on the a2 plus with that rear mounted
volume control as well as an IR sensor
that can be used with the included
fairly basic remote I guess I forgot to
mention that was included or with a
learning universal remote or with an
Android app called zap IR or zapper if
you have a phone with an integrated IR
blaster very cool on two listening tests
the a five pluses get loud house-party
loud even before these puppies were
burned in they were ear-shattering ly
loud without audible distortion at max
volume or even I didn't even turn them
up to max volume for near-field
listening although arguably since my
ears were shattered by that point it
would have been hard to pick out any
subtle problems with my favorite songs
after turning them down to more
reasonable levels I used my usual mix of
top 40 titanfall game streams on Twitch
and the basis all action sequence from
Captain America to do my evaluation of
these speakers and I came away really
really impressed the fact that they're
on a desk in front of you does give the
bass a bit of a sort of weird blowing
into your chest quality compared to
having a subwoofer sitting on the floor
so you can like really feel it
in your gut but aside from that it just
sounds really really good I mean
explosions rumbling action sequences
mid-range vocals come through with
fantastic clarity and aside from like
every other set of speakers in this
roundup losing to the B&amp;amp;W mm ones when
it came to stereo imaging and clarity in
the highs they're just the best
all-round option that I've used so far
out of the box they feel like the a 2
plus without compromises as much as I
can appreciate the way audio engine
steadfastly holds to the belief that
software tricks to improve bass
performance are unnatural and inherently
worse the a 2 plus could have benefited
from some trickery while the a 5 plus
with its larger cabinets just sounds
fantastic so there you have it
I recommended by if you want a great
listening experience and for some reason
you don't like headphones which will
invariably give you better bang for your
buck the a5 plus is available in a
variety of different colors black white
and a sexy bamboo finish that was too
expensive for me to bother buying it
just for to do a review but there you go
you might want to check it out and just
like with all of my videos you can find
a link with pricing and availability
that includes my affiliate code in the
video description under the like share
