AMD's new Kaveri architecture EP use
feature not only a quad-core CPU on
board but 47% of the diarrhoea is
actually taken up by a seriously
powerful DirectX 11 graphics processor
that uses a scaled-down version of the
same GCN architecture that you'll find
on their desktop Radeon series graphics
cards now you might be asking yourself
why does it matter that I have a
powerful graphics processor on my CPU
why do I need an APU to which I would
reply in this case HSA or heterogeneous
system architecture this is in a
nutshell the ability of the processor to
treat both its CPU cores and integrated
graphics processing cores as equals that
can work together rather than two
separate things that basically work
independently and communicate with each
other over the relatively slow PCI
Express bus now with HSA those two
processors can even access the same
system memory in order to achieve
perfect collaboration and while we'll
need software to play catch up a little
bit before the majority of your programs
are optimized for HSA the performance
benefits that can be realized are very
significant and with all of that in mind
it is time for a build guide featuring
this exciting processor that marks the
first availability of HSA hardware so
let's start off our rationale with the
apu just as a reminder an APU contains
both a CPU component and a GPU component
so we'll start with the CPU part with
its steamroller course Kaveri doesn't
dramatically improve raw CPU performance
over AMD's last generation richland
products but what it does do is it
delivers much lower power consumption
without losing any performance and while
adding some very important technologies
that establish AMD's leadership position
in HSA hardware I mean I guess when
you're the first one to actually deliver
something to the market that sets you up
pretty well for that leader title moving
on to the GPU the onboard graphics
is not your Grandpa's onboard graphics
though I mean I mean well if your
grandpa had onboard graphics then maybe
there was something pretty special
actually since your Grandpa's obviously
the doctor but but seriously the GCN
architecture of kuvira's integrated GPU
means that you get access to some
serious performance and features
aside from DirectX 11 which I mentioned
already is AMD's mantle api that
actually allows game developers to
better optimize their games to make the
most of the CPU power they have
available with a well optimised game we
can expect to unlock some serious
performance improvements over DirectX 11
with mantle stay tuned for the benchmark
section next up is AMD's true audio DSP
or digital sound processor a piece of
technology that could revolutionize the
way in-game audio is handled by game
engines in the long term in games rather
than relying on cheap software tricks to
achieve echoes and other spatial effects
true audio allow sound to balance
realistically off of objects accurately
according to the player surroundings and
outside of games the applications of
this technology include things like
cleaning background noise out of voice
recordings and much much more and all of
this is without using up valuable CPU
cycles then finally there's dual
graphics or the ability to basically run
your onboard graphics in crossfire with
a supported desktop graphics card for
tangible performance improvements we'll
be showing you this one running in
tandem with an r7 250 later on in the
video which leads us to memory in AMD's
internal testing they found that 8 gigs
is the sweet spot where most people
unless you're doing content creation or
some other kind of serious usage are not
using more than that and I will agree
with that upfront but they also found
that in addition to dual channel ddr3
1600 megahertz they are finding a
benefit all the way up to 2400 megahertz
dual channel ddr3 memory so I went with
G skills Ares to 2400 megahertz
2 by 4 gig kit for this
Euler build not because I necessarily
believe them right off the bat but
because I want to take this system when
we're done and do a little bit of
validation and find out if it's worth
the extra couple bucks as for why we
went with g.skill RAM on our test
benches we found that it just plain
works across a very wide variety of
motherboards to an extent that we don't
see from any other manufacturers so I've
never actually showcased them on the
channel before I figured we might as
well do that because it's something that
we do use internally and having ran that
just plain operates as intended his
pretty invaluable for the motherboard we
went with an ass rock FM to a 88 X
extreme 6 plus and honestly there's not
much of a rationale here I wasn't
particularly picky about the motherboard
for this build the most important thing
was to make sure I was getting one that
is FM 2 plus as opposed to FM 2 FM 2
plus CPUs are not backwards compatible
with FM 2 boards
whereas FM 2 Plus boards will work just
fine with FM 2 CPUs so make sure that
your retailer has FM 2 versus FM 2 +
boards clearly marked and if you're not
sure double check the manufacturers
website now there's a wide variety
available from all the usual suspects
and you'll find fancy features on some
of the boards vs. other ones but FM to
blast boards will have at least the
following features in common
number one trim support on SSDs running
in raid 0 that's a nice little
performance feature right there number 2
is support for ddr3 up to 2400 mega
Hertz operating in dual channel mode
although overclocking might get you a
little bit more this particular one
supports up to 2600 megahertz
with overclocking number 3 is support
for up to 4 displays off the onboard
graphics on that Kaveri APU that you've
got and number 4 again
powered by the onboard graphics is
support for 4k video output for cooling
we went with the cooler master hyper t4
which is actually AMD optimized out of
the box which is kind of unusual these
days there were no awkward adapters or
anything like that and it's got a nice
large fan all
at a very aggressive price we could use
the box CPU cooler but this one will
give us some cooling Headroom for the
overclocking tests later on and it's
going to run quieter as a whole
now storage is always so personal
normally I say get a WD blue or a
kingston v300 but I actually have to
leave off my traditional v300
recommendations since kingston recently
changed the flash that they're using on
that drive so crucial Xen 500 series and
Samsung's 840 Evo series are both
fantastic value oriented options as a
replacement for my usual V 300
recommendation I think most people in
this price range will choose the
capacity of a hard drive over the speed
of an SSD when it comes to storage but
another alternative is always grabbing
an SSD now and kind of living with the
small storage for a while then adding a
hard drive for bulk storage later it's
all just going to depend on your budget
and your upgrade schedule now the
graphics card is a very optional part of
this build and something that I would
consider more like an upgrade later
because we were going for a very value
optimized system when we put together
the initial list but this r7 250 is
capable of running in dual graphics mode
with the onboard GPU so that's
effectively like like crossfire between
your dedicated and your integrated
graphics and we will show you what you
can achieve by doing this particular
upgrade later on in the future by
running some benchmarks for you in the
conclusion of the video our case is the
source 210 elite from NZXT it doesn't
have many frills but it looks pretty
nice and it acts as a solid enclosure
for our power supply we've gone with a/c
Sonic SS 480 which in my mind is pretty
much the only power supply that matters
for the entry-level I mean okay it comes
in a couple of different you know
wattages but it's all basically the same
thing they're quiet they have 80 plus
bronze certification and see Sonic as a
manufacturer has a fantastic reputation
not to mention they're very inexpensive
for our OS we're going
with Windows 8 because Windows 8 so now
it's time for the actual building first
step is to start with a safe static free
workstation and an anti-static strap I
like to keep mine on my ankle so that it
stays out of my way while I'm trying to
work all we really need for assembly of
a modern computer is a multi-bit
screwdriver I like to use a magnetic one
because it doesn't do any damage to the
components and if you drop a screw
somewhere or whatever else it allows you
to dig it out of there without being
more difficult than it has to be now I
always recommend putting the system
together once outside of the case to
ensure that everything works while it's
nice and easy to get at the motherboard
lock makes a handy non conductive test
bench don't use the anti-static bag
that's in the motherboard on top of it
though once you power on the board some
of these bags have conductive outer
coatings and can actually short out your
motherboard so we'll start with CPU
installation carefully remove both the
CPU and the stock heatsink from the box
the pins on the CPU are very very
fragile so be extremely careful
especially with those next lift up the
retention arm on your motherboard align
the triangle on the corner of the CPU
with the triangle on the corner of the
socket place the CPU into the socket
don't push on it and then push down the
retention arm that's pretty much it grab
the thermal compound that is included
with your hyper t4 cooler if you were
using the stock heatsink you could just
use the thermal compound that is pre
applied to that then put a line down the
middle of the heat spreader it's a bit
bigger for AMD CPUs than it is for their
competitors CPUs because their heat
spreaders are a little bit larger next
up what you're going to do is grab all
the mounting hardware comes in a big bag
like this from your cpu heatsink box and
grab your memory you'll need both of
those for this step well one of them
anyway your memory goes in now because
the hyper t4 overhangs the memory slots
to the point where you won't be able to
install memory in all the slots once
you've installed your cooler
so for dual-channel operation consult
the manual of your motherboard but go
ahead and install them in what would
normally be color-coded slots but in the
case of this particular asrock board is
just going to be the ones that are
spaced out from each other whenever
installing ddr3 memory open up the tabs
align the memory being careful of the
notches carefully place it in then once
it's positioned correctly push down
firmly on both sides until the notches
click back into place on their own once
that's done this big bag of hardware
that I said you'd need ha you don't
actually need it I'm sorry I lied to you
guys all you need because this cooler
mounts natively on AMD is this hold down
arm that's it so we're going to position
our fan so that it is blowing air up
towards the top of the case then we're
going to go ahead and run this through
the bottom position it in the little
sort of mini heatsink at the bottom with
the slot in the middle accepting the
little notch in the retention bar place
it on to the CPU latch on the one side
that doesn't have a plastic retention
clip then latch it on to the other side
there we go and tension it boom just
like that
next up last step here is take that lead
for the CPU fan go ahead and tie it into
a nice little knot or tuck it away
somewhere in a corner preferably both
and then plug that four pin connector
into the four pin pwm fan connector on
the motherboard itself labeled CPU fan
one your CPU RAM and heatsink
they're all done when you take your case
out of the box I recommend taking the
packing materials and putting them
safely away in the box that way if you
ever have to ship your system somewhere
or otherwise transport it you're going
to know where those packing materials
are and your case box is a great place
to put the boxes for your other
components like your motherboard and CPU
etc just in case you have to send any of
them back for a warranty exchange at any
point you can pour storm all in there
put in the attic or whatever else
so the first step is to open up the side
panel this case uses thumb screws so you
can go ahead and take those out with
your fingers if not there are of course
screw slots in the back for a Phillips
head screwdriver you can use your
screwdriver instead take off that left
side panel go ahead put that in the case
box as well that way it'll stay safe and
it won't get knocked over or scratched
when you're in the process of building
your machine I recommend doing the same
thing with the other side panel the
first step whenever you open up any case
is to do a quick sanity check have a
look is the manual they're good as long
as the manuals there you can check and
find out what other hardware was
supposed to be included your case should
come with all of the hardware that you
need to install all of your components
inside of it installing the i/o shield
in a modern casing is pretty simple you
just go ahead and make sure that you've
got the top side up and you'll be able
to tell on this one because the ps2 and
USB ports are going to be at the top and
this is true of most of them the audio
ports will be at the bottom go ahead and
position it approximately correctly then
press on all four corners until they
have all snapped into place and it
doesn't come out any more now retail
power supplies will come with a bunch of
extras like installation screws and some
cable management stuff but even though
our power supply is completely OAM it
comes in a little baggie we have that
stuff anyway because it comes with your
case so this one comes with some zip
ties as well as the four hex screws
we're going to need to install our power
supply so next up we just need to choose
our orientation you can either have the
fan up so it's drawing air away from the
inside of the system and exhausting it
out the back or you can have fan side
down because in this case there's a
ventilation hole down there so the fan
actually keeps its own heat and the heat
of the other components completely
separate making it its own little
thermal zone and the other advantage of
this orientation is that usually the
cables come out this side and that puts
it closer to the motherboard tray for
easier cable management so we're going
to go fan side down the one thing to
watch out for if you have your fan down
is that you put your case onto a hard
surface such as a hardwood or laminate
floor because if you put it on a carpet
and the feet at the bottom of the case
again you could be suffocating your
power supply and causing it to overheat
from lack of airflow once it's
positioned go ahead and screw in the
four screws and the only spots where
they go and you have successfully
installed the power supply my friend and
it's already time to mount the
motherboard in the case first things
first you're going to want to find your
standoffs NZXT has done something here
that I actually haven't seen before and
they've got some steel content in their
standoffs meaning that when you use
their little tool which is an adapter
from a Phillips head screwdriver to a
socket for your standoffs you don't
actually lose the magnetic effect of
your screwdriver so normally cases
include brass standoffs so the adapters
magnetic but the standoffs themselves
fall out when you try to use them but
NZXT doesn't do that so we're going to
install the standoffs in the nine
locations required for a standard ATX
board here on the back of the
motherboard tray then to make our lives
a little bit easier we're going to lay
down our case position the motherboard
carefully above the standoffs making
sure not to scrape it
I recommend holding the motherboard by
the heatsink that you've already
installed slide it back towards the i/o
shield and then once you have positioned
it carefully above the standoffs go
ahead and put in the one middle screw so
that it doesn't shift around then you
can let go and put in the rest of the
screws hard drive installation for that
you're going to need two of the utility
screws that come in the bag full of lots
of screws with your case I mean that's
that's sort of the bulk of them they use
the same threading as a standard case
screw but they just have a slightly
different head then all you do is grab
your hard drive now okay this is a 500
gig one that was all our props
department was able to find but we
really do recommend the terabyte one for
its better capacity to price ratio go
ahead and pop one of the two lists
harddrive mounting pieces off of the
case by turning it counterclockwise
slide the hard drive into basically
whichever Bay you would like it's best
to have it next to somewhere that a fan
is mounted if there are any fans in your
case but this one doesn't come with any
and we haven't invested in many
fans so it doesn't really matter the one
thing I would think about is how close
the connectors are to the SATA ports on
your motherboard as well as how you're
going to route your power cable to the
back of the drive itself go ahead and
take your tula smelting mechanism pop
that back into the holes on the drive
turn it clockwise then if you're
concerned about the drive going anywhere
even though the tool is mounting
mechanism is enough if your powers just
going to sit next to your table I
usually recommend throwing a couple
screws into the other side just in case
and once you're finished that your hard
drive is mounted so with most of the
hardware for the system actually
installed at this point we're ready to
plug in our front panel connectors we're
going to start with USB 3 the pins are
very fragile so don't force it but good
news it's keyed on the one side so it
only goes in one way
next up we have our front connectors for
the power reset power LED and drive
activity LED for power and reset the
orientation doesn't matter just make
sure you get the leads on the correct
pins but for the hard drive LED as well
as the power led the positive pin has to
correspond to the positive lead so
double check your manual if you're not a
hundred percent sure for front USB 2 you
can plug into any of the three
connectors that are labeled front USB 2
and there is one blacked out pin or
empty pin that goes into the place where
there is an empty block in the connector
itself and you're actually going to see
the same thing with the front panel
audio where it's not in the same
position so you can't accidentally plug
those into the wrong ones
but there is one blanked out once you go
ahead and plug that in in the bottom
left corner of your board this
motherboard has lots of fan headers so
you can go ahead and run those two
included fans the 140 millimeter at the
top and the 120 millimeter at the back
pretty much wherever you want now there
are labels on them like power fan or
chassis fan or CPU fan but it doesn't
really matter as long as you remember
where you've plugged it in or I mean you
can always play around with it after the
fact the only time it'll ever make a
difference what type of fan it is is
when you look in the BIOS and you see
the label
and you're adjusting the profile for it
or whatever else so go ahead and plug
those in they're both three pin fans but
you can plug them into either a four pin
or a three pin connector just like we
did and one little trick that I used is
I cut off the molex connectors that are
on these fans by default these are here
just in case you don't have enough spare
headers on your motherboard so that you
can power the fans directly off the
power supply the advantage of which
being you can plug in as many as you
want
the disadvantage of which being that you
will not be able to control them through
your motherboards UEFI or BIOS in order
to turn the fan speeds down and up
dynamically when your system is under
higher or lower levels of stress next up
is our main power connectors for the
motherboards so we've got the a pin
which goes in the top corner now if I've
been a little bit smarter I might have
pre cable managed this one before I put
the motherboard into the case but have
no fear there is a cable management hole
up at the top of the case that allows us
to run that wire up the back there are
also cable management loops back here so
we can strap it down and make sure it's
nice and tight so we're not going to
have any difficulty closing that side
panel then bring the connector up
through the front and plug it into the a
pin spot above the CPU socket for the 24
pin it's actually even simpler so we're
going to run that through the cable
management hole down at the bottom of
the case and then it's going to go a
very short distance also using the cable
management loops at the back of the case
to hold it securely in place and then
plug into the 24 pin connector along the
right-hand edge of the motherboard our
motherboard is now powered to plug in
the hard drive all we have to do is plug
our SATA cable into the motherboard any
of the SATA ports will do there's no
master/slave relationship like there
used to be with IDE then plug that data
cable into the back of the drive and
finally a power cable into the back of
the drive as well one thing that I
usually like to do is instead of using
the last SATA connector in the chain use
the second last one or third last one
because that will leave the additional
ones free as kind of a courtesy
connector for next time you want to
install a hard drive
you don't have to reroute another SATA
cable of our two last steps one is
optional and one is well I guess it's
optional but please tidy up your cables
so first we're going to remove the two
PCI brackets that correspond to our top
PCI Express 16x slot then we are going
to position our graphics card above the
slot plug it in basically just by
pushing evenly on it on both sides once
it is locked into place you can go ahead
and put the two screws that you took out
to remove those brackets back into the
top of the card and where normally I'd
be telling people to find the PCI
Express connector on your power supply
and plug it in that's not necessary with
the r7 250 because it is entirely
powered by the PCI Express slot once
we're done with that we can go ahead and
do any last-minute cable management so
you can take that bundle of wires and
you can tie them down nice and tight
down at the bottom of the case or as
another option you can throw them behind
the drive cages here if you want to go
for a little bit of a tidier look but
maybe impede access to some of the screw
holes at the back if you ever wanted to
fill this baby up with hard drives
you're also going to want to you know
grab a pair of scissors and cut off any
extra nubbins on the end of your zip
ties and all that good stuff and your
system is physically complete now that
the system is mostly set up physically
it's time for software setup so in the
BIOS there's only a couple of things
we're going to have to do double check
and make sure AHCI is enabled for your
SATA ports and ensure that all your
components are detected then dial in
that 24 hundred megahertz memory to the
correct speed if you're ever not a
hundred percent sure about the timings
the voltage and the frequency you can
find that either on the manufacturer
website or actually usually on the
modules themselves just make sure you
power down your system before you go
yanking your memory modules out of it -
like we decide on them or anything like
that next up is Windows installation
which is super simple if you know how
don't worry about the lack of the disk
drive in this machine we can grab all
that stuff off a disk on another system
copy it to a USB Drive then
from that it's faster and more
convenient we've actually done a guide
on this before so go ahead and check out
the video annotation link here if you
want to check that out in a simple
system like this there's only one drive
so installing windows on the default
drive is just the way to go it'll come
completely unformatted and by default
it'll fill your entire drive with your
windows installation and then all the
spare area you need in order to install
all your applications and all that good
stuff your system will automatically
reboot a couple times and you will be
dumped at the desktop now drivers are
something that many people struggle with
but it's not too overwhelming if you
break it down install the drivers off of
the disk for things like your network
because you're obviously not going to be
able to get on the internet unless you
have a network driver then go to the
manufacturer website for things like
your video card which is AMD whether you
put in the discrete graphics or you're
running the onboard graphics as well as
your motherboard which is asrock and
just grab all of the stuff for your
particular component and install it if
there's anything missing don't worry too
much about it because all you have to do
is use this little simple trick go to
device manager right-click the component
in question usually it'll have a little
exclamation mark with a yellow triangle
around it then go to details use the
drop down box to go to hardware ID
Google the then underscore number number
number and dev underscore number number
number string and it will tell you
exactly what that thing happens to be
and then you're golden now it's time to
test our system now I promised a couple
of benchmarks showing some of the
benefits of HSA and now's the time Corel
aftershock Pro was run side by side on
just the CPU and with HSA enabled to
take advantage of our entire APU and
then we followed up with a couple runs
of PC mark 8 huge thanks to future mark
by the way for providing us with a
professional copy which is also HSA
aware and demonstrates a very
significant increase in overall system
performance especially in the work and
creation Suites our
graphics test takes advantage of the
Nanta api the star swarm benchmark which
we've run in both direct Dex mode and
mantle mode to see what kind of
performance improvements we can get with
an APU seems to validate that mantle is
going to have some wings to fly on in
the future even though right now there
aren't a ton of games that support it to
validate the operation of dual graphics
we've run BioShock Infinite and Far Cry
3 with just the integrated GPU just the
r7 250 utilizing only the CPU part of
our APU and then finally with the APU
running in dual graphics with the GPU to
show you guys that there is a tangible
performance improvement now there is
still a strong argument for more
powerful discrete graphics but as a
proof of concept dual graphics looks
like a promising technology for the
future especially on notebooks where the
discrete graphics card can be turned off
entirely when it's not needed to save
power other than that something like an
r7 260x is the kind of upgrade that I
would look for for a system like this to
take a look at the performance
improvements that we can gain from
increasing our memory frequency our G
skill kit is clocked at 20 400 megahertz
by default but we tried under clocking
it to 2133 1866 and 1600 megahertz to
see what you get for the extra couple of
bucks
looks pretty worthwhile to give that
onboard graphics some extra memory
bandwidth when you're gaming hey for our
last performance test we take our star
swarm benchmark and then run it at stock
speed and then with the CPU and the GPU
on our APU both substantially
overclocked looks like there's some fun
to be had for tutors and tweakers who
want to try to squeeze the most out of
this value-oriented onboard solution I
hope you guys enjoyed this video and
learned a little something about HSA and
the kinds of performance leaps it will
enable in the future along with the
other AMD technology showcased in this
build guide one that I actually didn't
mention before is 4k media playback
HSA accelerated media players will allow
your GPU to handle 4k video playback
without taxing your CPU over much and
remember both of those things are part
of the APU this is the kind of
future-proof Ness that isn't necessarily
about some you know greasy car salesman
telling you that you'll be playing the
latest games at 4k in five years if you
buy this one because that kind of
teacher proof this really doesn't exist
rather it's about making sure that the
system maintains its base functionality
over a nice long period of time by
unlocking additional performance with
improved software over the time that you
