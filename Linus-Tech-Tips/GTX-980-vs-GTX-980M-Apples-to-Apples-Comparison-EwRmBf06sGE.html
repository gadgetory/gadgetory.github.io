what they used to be
rage TNT monsters Spitfire that kind of
good stuff
at least the drivers are much improved
and instead of having like you know the
good video cards and then the like
kneecapped video cards that suck you're
getting really great performance at
pretty much every price point these days
but the big question still remains well
two big questions really first are you
stoked to see part two of personal rig
update 2015 with a 3d model of the
custom case that I'll be making drop a
like if you are and second is a laptop
video card good enough for serious
gaming or do you need desktop grade
graphics let's find out
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
click the link in the video description
to learn more so this video was inspired
by a piece of content that we did
recently on the changes in performance
of a graphics card over time as drivers
mature you can check that out up there
and by a brainstorm that I had the other
day when we were working on our
inventory and I saw the Sager and p90
773 a laptop with a core i7 4790k and I
went lightbulb
yeah the rational last time we checked
out the gtx 980m
which we did about 10 months ago when it
was released of well you know the cpu
doesn't seem to be much of a system
bottleneck in gaming these days so it's
probably fine that one system is using a
desktop chip and the other is using well
a laptop one was probably fine but real
scientists only change the variable that
they want to compare at least when they
want halfway decent results so I decided
to revisit the testing that was inspired
by this slide from Nvidia where I wanted
to see what the gap really is between
the desktop and a laptop gaming
experience with the same class of GPU so
this will be a head-to-head battle
between the gtx 980 and the 980 m but
this time it'll be a fairer fight
instead of hamstringing the 980 m with a
mobile cpu I took advantage of the fully
turbo type we're talking 4.4 gigahertz
Devil's Canyon core i7 4790k in it that
means both systems are set up
identically with 16 gigs of ram Windows
8.1 with all the latest updates a 1080p
screen resolution and solid-state
storage with the only difference being
the graphics cards and the results may
shock you
we saw a 30 to 40 percent performance
delta across the board just like last
time ok so yes the results aren't very
shocking at all but at least now we know
for certain
just how far behind the desktop roadmap
the mobile one is lagging which leads us
to the next come
Harrison price while the mobile gtx 980m
performs worse than a desktop gtx 980
its pricing puts it above the desktop
part at least if ebay is to be believed
is hard to actually find these things on
a retail shelf and when you combine that
with the generally higher costs
associated with most of the rest of the
components of a laptop i mean the cost
of developing an individual motherboard
for every custom-made chassis compared
to standardized desktop parts is very
very high it means that laptop gamers
are going to be paying more for less so
it makes our apples-to-apples comparison
quite difficult because what is an apple
really is it the same branded class of
hardware again it's the same branded
class of hardware or do we you have to
look at it from a performance per dollar
perspective and then how do you account
for things that have a value but would
seem ridiculous to try to quantify on a
graph like being able to transport your
gaming experience around with you very
easily so the answer is for now not so
different from what it's always been
while performance is no longer several
generations behind the cost I mean our
similarly kitted out desktop costs
hundreds of dollars less than our laptop
even when you don't factor in the
ability to reuse your previous monitor
something that many desktop owners will
do makes gaming laptops the weapon of
choice really only for folks who lack
the space for two discrete machines a
desktop and a notebook and who are able
to afford the convenience tax of mushing
them into one but with some of the
product rumours circulating now both
unsubstantiated like that Nvidia may be
releasing a desktop gtx 980 like not
m-class mobile GPU and substantiated
like all the new products that are
coming with intel skylake processors
inside it appears as though the future
maybe even the near future is going to
be very interesting I mean to be clear I
don't think that the pricing gap is
going away but for gamers
it looks like the performance gap will
continue to shrink and while I can hear
some of you groaning about skylake
CPU saying there's nothing special about
them from a performance standpoint
compared to Broadwell or even has well
consider this Intel is bringing more
power savings with skylake can you go
you performance but maybe it is that's
power that can be used for you guessed
it better graphics course in those
laptops so maybe there's just a shifting
if the available resources happening to
bring us better mobile gaming but
whatever way that goes we'll be covering
it for sure and in the meantime I hope
you guys enjoyed our look at just how
much there is separating desktop and
notebook graphics today and on that
subject or more accurately thought on
that subject at all I guess master OPCON
master opcom is the site where basically
the community decides like hey guys
let's all get together and like buy this
thing and then master ops all like ok
let's find you know a legitimate non
counterfeit source either direct from
the manufacturer from a reputable
distributor let's get a bunch of those
things for you guys and then let's make
sure that it's cheaper because a whole
bunch of you have committed to buy it at
once so the way it works is once
something goes up on the mass drop site
but more people commit to buy the better
the price gets until it reaches a
defined limit and the whole this is a
good one the feature deal today is the
LG 34 um 95 C - P yes my friends that is
a flat ultra wide 34 40 by 1440 IPS
monitor very very similar to the one
that I reviewed here declaring 4k to be
dead to me and that's to be my new
favorite monitor super awesome super
worth checking out head over to draw up
slash Linus tech tips to learn more
about it today and if you're not signed
up for mass drop you're probably gonna
get dropped on a landing page get signed
up for mass drop because they got all
kinds of other cool stuff as well thanks
