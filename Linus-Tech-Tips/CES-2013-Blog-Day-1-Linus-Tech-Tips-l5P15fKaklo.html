that pale okay so we're still boarding
on the plane so I have something very
tragic to show you guys the physiques
are supposed to rotate many degrees like
this
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate Technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Cisco now this is something that's not
quite future mate
this is slicks entire baggage for the
entire trip we're gonna be good for a
week so he's either some kind of a
foodie magician or he's gonna really
really smell by the Friday for context
diesel my feet have a tech bag over
there
plus carry ons and backpacks and
everything you see here belongs to me
and Musa Lawrence equipment that 700 and
then we have two huge
I'll show you those banks when they come
out so to make this really clear
pleasing stuff my stock banks quick stop
and he's not even wearing a jacket so
the magic
we have picked up our fourth member I
doing guys
we find a cat
we're gonna be doing soon but check this
out we actually brought our own video
editing rendering station
you guys are going to be pretty
impressed by this I think and I totally
opened up the rums if I'm very tired
it's like time to check in and being
sleeping pretty soon as they got
meetings tomorrow and all that check
this out
brought our shuttle 39 60 X 12 16 gigs
of RAM editing machine so diesel will
have everything he needs we also brought
an IPS 24 inch monitor which is just
inside here so you're gonna see all the
cool stuff we have once we get
I can't unpack and it's time for the
ridiculousness of how I have actually
transported our editing monitor here
it's not the best monitor for that we
didn't bring our color corrector because
actually I forgot I was like oh we
should pick it up so check this out I
hope it survived it is packed in with
boxers basically and here it is we got
an Acer 23 inch IPS so we're gonna set
up on the desk over here I had to take
the let's take the base off got some
good stuff in here
check this out Mike says Ã«i 40 mm
router because you never know when
you're gonna need to share the internet
connection in your room DVI cables to
power cables ah still serious gaming
mouse oh is that a gen 1 G 15 in
pristine condition nothing but the best
for the line is tech tips crew here's
the stand for the monitor itself also
got a screwdriver but I can put that
there stand on a no big deal got
something like snaps anymore
sure yeah they're not great and they're
expired but it's Vegas if you're not
gonna gamble but you should GTFO all
right what else we got here yes really
they are inspired and I hope you've got
travel insurance
