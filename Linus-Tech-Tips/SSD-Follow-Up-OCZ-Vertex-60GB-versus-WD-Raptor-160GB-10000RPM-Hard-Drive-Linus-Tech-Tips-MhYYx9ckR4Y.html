hard drive tech tips why don't you try a
faster hard drive so I thought you know
what I'll do you one better because it
was a bit of an unfair comparison that
time I had the vertex le which is OCC's
fastest SSD and I had it against it's a
good hard drive don't get me wrong the
WD one terabyte black is an exceptional
hard drive but it is a 7200 rpm Drive
and is therefore a little bit limited so
okay here first things first I'm gonna
press the buttons on my to test bed pcs
here at the same time get those booting
up so I have changed to a 10,000 rpm
Drive I'm now using a Western Digital
Raptor 160 gig I would have used a
velociraptor but the reality of it is I
just don't have one on hand and then
I'll go one better instead of testing a
super fast SSD against the 10k rpm drive
I've gone and found a slower SSD so I
got a vertex 60 gig drive to test
against the Raptor 160 gigabyte so I'm
gonna get the cameraman to have a look
over there MSN's up okay so the SSD is
now loaded and it is absolutely killing
the Raptor so we might have to wait
another moment for the Raptor to finally
there we go MSN Messenger is done so
there are a lot more tests that we can
run here and I'm gonna do sort of a
quick snapshot at the same kinds of
stuff that I did last time around so why
don't we just launch left 4 dead 2 my
favourite PC games see which one takes
longer already the SSD is way out in the
lead
ok I'm gonna cheat a little bit in favor
of the hard drive here and I'm gonna
press escape on both computers at the
same time ok so you can see that loads
just as fast and then when it actually
starts to load again you can see that
the SSD pulls away again alright so
let's go over over over over to single
player and let's launch a single player
campaign
start game there we go and we are going
to observe once again I'm going to
hypothesize that the SSD will load the
level faster let's find out if I'm right
remember this is a slower SSD than we
were using last time against a faster
harddrive there you go we are yeah I
wasn't counting but we're some some
seconds ahead of the hard drive on this
particular test and one of the other
things that I've I mean personally I
really like about running an SSD is the
fact that whenever you alt-tab out of a
program even if it's a 3d program
there's like a chair in the counter
minutes way here I'm just gonna move
that you can actually see I'm holding
alt pressing tab right now oh wow that
actually went really fast for the hard
drive that's um that's actually pretty
unusual but either way with the SSD I
have observed for myself that usually
you can minimize and maximize things
like games a lot faster that's pretty
impressive anyway okay so let's see what
else we got here actually this is a good
one okay launching we're gonna open just
uh it's an HD video file it's actually
one of my video blog videos that some
that's not rien coded so it's quite a
large file we're gonna open it in
Windows Media Center to see which one
opens it faster oh yeah
playing on the SSD and we're still
waiting just to play a video file look
at that there you go hard drive finally
does it so I'll test
a flock okay so we're going to close
both of these alts f4 and the SST closes
faster even if I press it in exactly the
same time so let's see how much how much
further do I have to go with this
because the whole point of this is that
it was it had nothing to do with which
SSD I was testing and which hard drive I
was testing the point is SSDs because of
their miniscule response times will
always outperform a hard drive
especially in just your random mundane
day-to-day tasks they're just faster
so let's actually okay let's do a couple
more things here for you let's launch
Internet Explorer and we're not waiting
for it
look how long you wait for what Internet
Explorer to just load a webpage okay
I mean Internet it shouldn't even be
affected by your PC at this point in
time but hard drives are just too too
slow and it's not about oh well I can
afford to wait two seconds yeah it's two
seconds but it's two seconds every time
you know show me another upgrade you can
do with your computer that will actually
impact performance by by cutting time
that it takes to do things in half every
time you do them anyway thanks for
checking out my video blog and I hope
that this has enlightened all of the
naysayers</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
