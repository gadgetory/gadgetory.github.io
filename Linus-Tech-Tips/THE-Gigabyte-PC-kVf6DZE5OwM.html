coverage of CES 2017 possible check out
their awesome skins down below what we
have here is V gigabyte PC that's its
name it's the GT series gigabyte PC as
the 6700 K in it which is last gen but
that's probably fine if you've seen our
KB Lake video it has a 1070 in it
although that could be swapped out and
configurable by the user because it is a
full-size card now the power supply in
the bottom of the unit is 400 watts
which should be able to handle what's
currently in it just fine but if you
want to upgrade to say a 1080 Ti which
we have no information about yet at all
they do have a solution for you this guy
it's an extra 135 watts that can feed
right into the motherboard and will free
up some extra space on the power supply
just because you need to add that to the
graphics card you'll be completely fine
or if you need extra power for Paul I
mean just plug this in and more power
supply space will be freed up for Paul
on the front of the unit we have two USB
3.1 gen2 Iker phone and headphone jack
and a power button on the back kind of
if you remove this side panel here you
have more ports you have four type-a 3.1
Gen 1 ports one type C 3.1 gen2 ports
and HDMI to the motherboard along with
the in connection for this additional
power it comes as a bare-bones unit
meaning you have no RAM no SSDs no in
nvme drives no hard drives none of that
kind of stuff you can upgrade it
yourself there's two sodam slots and
there's at least two two and a half inch
drives and at least one MDOT two spacing
but I'm not entirely sure about all
those we'll get more information later
on in terms of cooling as far as I can
tell just from feeling around there's
one spine on the back of the unit that
seems to pull in your cool air and then
these big panels on the top kind of
corners and the very actual top and the
front of the unit all seem to be
exhausting hot air and then last but
apparently not least if you look at the
entire market right now as a whole is
the RGB LEDs which happen to go in a
ring around the top of the unit that
look pretty cool because they go through
this weird meshing which gives them a
little bit of I guess you could say
texture just above those you have these
two panels that like click when you
press them so at first I thought they
were weird
for some reason but they're not when the
unit gets too hot
these will pop up and it will allow for
even more external venting but I don't
know if we don't have the driver or
something right now we can't actually
make it happen so I'm just going to give
you a representation of what would
happen if if it was properly set up all
right guys thanks for watching let me
know what you guys think about V
gigabyte PC down in the comments below I
just I love the name would you prefer
this to be a bare-bones when you prefer
it with memory and storage on it I'm a
little conflicted let me know down below
also of course thank you to D brand for
bringing us to CES 2017 this year we use
their stuff on our phones I have one
right now with a marble skin on my phone
we also have them on our blades that we
got for Christmas they ship worldwide
you can use the configurator to make
your device look like your own device
one of my favorite ones that we made was
this old weird funky looking iPhone
anyways check them out description down
below I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
