be having a look at yet another one of
gigabytes new lineup of p55 a
motherboards now the key improvement
that they've made with the p55 a series
is that it features their three three
three onboard acceleration that means
they've got USB 3.0 power 3x which means
that all of the USB ports are able to
provide three times the specified amount
of power and it also has SATA 3.0 or
SATA 3 which is actually SATA 6 gigabits
per second in terms of speed now let's
just clear some junk out of the way and
let's get this board open as with all of
their recent boards recent high-end
boards it does feature ultra durable 3
which is their 2 x 2 ounce copper PCB
now let's just have a quick look at the
accessories we've got the i/o shield
okay we've got an IDE cable and two SATA
cables then we have the manual as well
as an installation CD for the drivers
the smart six users manual as well as
the multilingual installation guide book
and we have a paper divider in the
middle and an anti-static bag featuring
two UD three motherboard now the UD 3 is
the lowest end of the VP 55a boards that
are on the market right now but it does
still have most of the key features the
big one that's missing is SLI support so
although you can see we've got an ATI
crossfire X logo here you do not have
support for SLI in these PCI Express
ports now let's go around and do a quick
rundown of the board itself so you've
got your CPU socket in the middle you've
got what appears to be
do-do-do-do-do well looks like four or
six phase power I can't tell but I'm
just going to keep rolling with this
then we've got our mosfet heat sinks
which are up here okay we've got support
for the usual four dims of ddr3 memory
the power plugs are in there ideal
locations with the a pin up at the top
left and the 24 pin over on the right
hand edge okay now in terms of SATA this
is where this board starts to get
interesting because you can see here
we've got six
say to to ports and these are running
off of the Intel chipset and then right
here running off this Marvell chipset
right here we've got 2 SATA 3 ports so
for a total of 8 SATA ports and these
ones are running at 6 gigabit per second
so that's really going to start to make
a difference with the new generation
SSDs that are going to be coming down
the pipe although we do have the
Barracuda XT already available which is
a 6 gigabit per second compatible
magnetic hard drive ok so before we wrap
this up I just wanted to have a quick
look at the i/o panel so first of all
you've got one of those ps2 combo ports
I love these they'll accept either a USB
or a keyboard a USB or a keyboard a
mouse or a keyboard then we have 8 USB
2.0 ports we've got our digital audio
and then these blue ports down here are
USB 3.0 so that runs at 5 gigabit per
second much much faster than the old USB
2.0 standard I mean with these you'll be
able to max out any current hard drive
in terms of sustained reads and writes
without worrying about any kind of
bottlenecking
very cool then we've got a Gigabit LAN
port as well as a 7.1 audio out so thank
you for checking out my unboxing and
quick overview of the gigabyte p55 a UD
