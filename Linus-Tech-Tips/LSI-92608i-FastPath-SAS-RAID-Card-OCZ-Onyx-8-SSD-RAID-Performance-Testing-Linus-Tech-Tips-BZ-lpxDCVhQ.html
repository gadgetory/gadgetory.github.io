had a chance to run the 8 o'seas e onyx
series SSDs in raid zero so you can see
I've got these hooked up to an LSI mega
RAID fast path SSD optimized RAID
controller and what fast PAP does is it
actually allows SSDs to perform a little
bit better so fast path is just a little
little key that I have on there it also
enables some advanced encryption
features as well as the ability to use
SSDs as a cache for a hard drive rate of
rate so that's said this is a pretty
cool card this is the 90 to 60 and it's
it's actually a SAS I didn't unboxing of
it it's a SAS 6 gigabit per second card
but as you can see it's obviously
compatible with SATA 2 SSDs I shouldn't
even call it SATA 2 what I mean to say
is SATA 3 gigabit per second so here
I'll show you actually here why don't we
take this video as an opportunity to
show you how easy it is to set up a RAID
controller card in a raid 0
configuration so first of all I want to
show you some benchmarks here you can
see that with this array we were able to
achieve almost 700 megabytes per second
read which honestly shouldn't be that
impressive
this card is capable of well over 1
gigabyte per second read with the right
SSDs so that I was actually a little bit
disappointed in but the right speeds are
very impressive the right scaled almost
linearly on these SSDs so we were able
to achieve up to 450 megabytes per
second on writes so I'll show you what I
mean by all of this in just a moment
here this is kind of interesting I
wasn't having any challenges with the
with the raid configuration before you
know what I think it is well it looks
like you get to see some real-time
troubleshooting here I think we've just
got the wrong IP address because I was
using this at home so I have the the
system IP wrong 1 9 2 1 6 8 3 1 8 5 do
that
and there we go
so let me just log in here alright and
now we're going to go into the the
megabraid configuration so the reason
I'm a little bit disappointed with the
with the overall read speeds as you can
see with well you were able to see you
can see with a to drive array so this is
using all the same rage configuration we
were able to achieve 307 megabytes per
second already now with SSDs typically
with a good quality RAID controller like
we have and and a good quality SSD you
should see almost completely linear
scaling so while these drives are rated
for 125 megabytes per second reads
maximum you can see with two drives we
were actually seeing that these drives
perform a little bit better than spec
and they're scaling extremely well
because only two drives yield such
strong read results now this down here
is the random performance so you can see
even with eight drives do random
performance doesn't change very much so
we've only got about 6,000 I ops in 4k
performance which is actually still very
good compared to any hard drive I mean
you got to sort of keep that in
perspective but performance didn't
really scale much from two drives all
the way up to eight drives so you can
see two drives we were seeing about 20
megabytes per second and then up to
eight drives we see about 25 now with a
deeper queue depth and a bigger array
you do see more you do see better
performance and what that means is that
if you're multitasking a lot on a huge
array like this you're going to see
better performance and it will continue
to scale versus if you're not
multitasking and you're just reading and
writing small 4k files now another thing
that did scale really really well with
adding more drives was the writes so you
can see right I ups are almost 3x when
we add four times as many drives so
that's still reasonably good scaling so
I just want to show you the numbers as
we go through here so remember this is
eight drives this is the run I just did
like two seconds ago and then this one
here is with two drives
this is with four drives so you can see
from two to four did not scale nearly as
well so back to two up to four did not
scale nearly as well in reads as from 1
to 2 because from 1 to 2 we got almost
linear scaling but you can see that
especially writes scaled incredibly well
so our sequential writes doubled
actually a little bit more than doubled
and then our 4k writes more than doubled
so very very efficient there and so then
from 4 drives I went to 6 drives so once
again you see quite limited scaling in
some areas but again excellent scaling
on the sequential right so that's where
we're seeing just just huge improvements
and then finally this is an 8 drive run
that I did before I was using slightly
better tweaked raid settings so that's
probably actually the one I should be
showing you more than more than any
other one but but yeah that's how I was
able to squeeze just a little bit more
sequential read out of the whole thing
and actually substantially better 4k
random writes so anyway that was pretty
much my video I think that what we've
discovered here is that using 8 SSDs of
very very low performance I mean the
Onyx is a value SSD there's there's no
two ways about it I think what we'd be
better off with is using something like
4 to 6 higher performance SSDs something
like a vertex - I mean vertex 2 right
out of the box is going to outperform
probably anywhere from two to three of
these onyx SSDs so what I discovered
running this experiment is that you're
probably better off with fewer SSDs but
higher performance ones so I'll just
show you really quickly when you have
when you have a premium raid card like
this how easy and how quick it is to set
up a raid array all you really do is go
into actually you know what no I can't
show you this because I wanted to
actually boot up to the to the SSD raid
array so no I can't wipe out my array
but it's really fast you'll have to just
believe me you click this button up here
you select the drives you press raid 0
and then there are actually some options
that you can config
here so if I go into my virtual drive
here I believe I can go to virtual drive
and I can set all the virtual drive
properties so these are some of the
things that that you can tinker around
with if you do set up an SSD raid array
so I've set things up according to how
LSI has recommended for the best fast
path performance although some people do
report better performance with no read
ahead and some people do get better
performance with a write back cache
enabled as well as cached i/o it really
varies depending on your SSD so you have
to tweak and find out what works well
with your controller and your SSD so
