overclocking arena from msi i'm here at
the Welcome booth right now I'm actually
sort of co-hosting this event so I'm not
just arriving right now but I'm just
going to show you guys sort of some of
the stuff going on here this is at the
pole position a las vegas raceway so
anyone who comes to the event can also
sign up i believe to do some go-karting
and then they can also check out the
live overclocking over there so we got
some swag we have vibrating hand
grenades just bizarre and then we also
have some dog tags and whatnot so
there's a little sign so I'm going to
head in and we're going to check out
some of the new products that emphasize
showing off apparently there's also a
buffet coming out so I'm gonna have to
check that out in a little bit all right
here we go so this is the video card
table so there's some stuff here that
we're already familiar with we've bought
the and 460 gtx hawk which as you guys
probably know was one of the Bert well I
believe it was the first gtx460 to
achieve a 1 gigahertz overclock on air
it's been quite a popular product over
its life cycle we've also got a few
things here that our brand new so this
is one that I've never seen before this
is a gtx 580 lightning so i'll have a
look at the overall specs here it has a
16 phase pwm design that is one of the
most critical aspects for an
overclocking card it also has two 8-pin
pci express connectors and it is capable
of running and up to three wait probably
for way too but up to 3-way SLI
configurations because it does have to
sli bridges we've also got voltage
readout points here on the top of the
part and it looks like we're using a
let's see how many heat pipes is that on
the stock cooler this is a twin frozer
three design stock cooler with dual 92
millimeter fans and it looks like we've
got one two three four five geet pipes
directly over the GPU there so that's a
pretty cool one we've also got a radeon
6850 and
see 970 so the 6850 is using their ever
popular cyclone cooler and then this one
right here so this is a 69 70 lightning
so this uses an 18 phase PWM design two
gigs of memory just like a normal 69 70
and what else have they done a year to
make this card custom well I can see a
couple of things right off the bat the
dual BIOS switch well it's been moved I
guess we've also got the voltage readout
points as well as the dual eight pin
power connectors we saw on the gtx 580
and last but not least we have gold
plated connectors for our dual mini
displayport hdmi and dual DVI connectors
I didn't notice fat on the gtx 580
lightning but you can see that that one
has gold plated displayport hdmi and
dual h and dual DVI as well so let's
move belong here we're going to have a
look i'll be doing unboxings of all of
these motherboards over the next couple
weeks but we've got some age 67 boards
so these are supporting Intel's latest
core i3 and core i5 while they support
core i7 as well but I probably wouldn't
be putting a core i7 on an age 67 board
because if you're buying a core i7 I
would definitely recommend spending a
couple extra bucks to get a case series
processor and the age 67 chipset does
not support a multiplier changing so you
really shouldn't use a case series
processor in it these are the boards
that I'm more interested in these are
their p67 boards so we're moving from
the lowest end so this is AC series
board meaning it only has single
graphics up to their lowest end g-series
board so this is a great value board
that has the board for
oh there's a lot of noise there right
now okay well hopefully I can drown it
out have support for dual sli and
crossfire in 8 X 8 X mode let's move on
along so the GD 65 is an upgraded
version of the GD 55 so it actually uses
the same PCB same number of power phases
there's just a couple key differences so
you can see there are some spots on this
board where there are things that appear
to be well missing so let's show you
what this one has it has more say 26
gigabit per second ports it also has
let's see what else what else is changed
oh it has dual eSATA ports on the back
whereas the 55 board does not and I
recall seeing more changes when i did my
unboxing but i think it's all yeah there
we go we got v checkpoints here at the
top where is here we only have solder
points for them so those are a couple of
the key changes that they've made on the
65 version looked like this one is
actually mislabeled this is has the same
label in front of it as that one but
this is a p67 a GD 80 so this one's
supporting up the freeway SLI and
crossfire you've also got a
supplementary power connector here in
order to have full support for all those
GPUs it does have more power phases
using a
oh man it looks like a 10 plus three
phase power design but I'm actually not
a hundred percent sure one thing you
know for sure it is is that it is using
dr. Moss and their military class two
concepts what else do we have on this
one we've got statistics gigabit we've
got Wow six USB 3.0 ports on the back
panel so that's pretty exciting thing to
see as well as look at that two more
additional front panel USB 3.0 ports so
we got a TV we got the racetrack back
there that's a pretty cool thing to be
able to check out I know a lot of the
guys who are here for the event are also
racing here we've got a little test
bench set up we've also got their big
bang xpower motherboard which is
actually the one that I use in my own
system i'm a big fan of this board
really like it i've got a 980x extreme
edition processor in mind and this this
is new this one I haven't seen before
this is a non standard layout board so
you can see it's actually a little bit
wider than a normal ATX board and it's
also a little bit longer because
normally there'd be one slot here and
then we've got one two three four five
six seven eight eight pci express 16x
physical slots now these aren't going to
all run at 16 x band width i believe
this one i'll have to follow up for you
guys when I do an unboxing of this board
and find out how they've managed to
achieve this many PCI Express slots on a
p67 motherboard because remember that
board is only natively going to support
a single 16 X or dual 8x at a single
four x pci express slots let's see what
other kinds of features we've got so we
do have a supplementary pcie 6 pin power
connector dual 8-pin cpu power
connectors for that LGA 1155 cpu we've
got one two three four five six seven
eight
10 11 12 13 14 15 looks like a 16 plus 2
phase power design and then we've got
support for dual-channel ddr3 memory
we've got some dip switches up here
which I'm not actually sure what those
are for may be there for over voltage or
something like that I can't even begin
to speculate until I have some actual
specs in front of me here oh and looks
like that's a 24 phase power design my
bad there might actually be other stuff
buried in there alright we've got our
24-pin connector in its ideal location
we've got voltage checkpoints we've got
four pci SATA 36 gigabit per second
ports we've got support for up to four
front USB 3 ports and eight additional
USB 3 ports on the back panel of the
board although I mean really I can talk
about all the stuff all the other things
all I want but the reality of it is like
check this out aight pcie 16x slot so
you're going to need a special case to
house this particular motherboard but
we're going to get some pretty good
performance out of the core i7 2600 k or
any future processors with a motherboard
like this so I'm also going to take you
guys sort of a little bit further in you
can check out the all the liquid
nitrogen that is on hand for this
overclocking event as well as some of
the cool camera setups that we're using
to see all of these febrile using to
actually broadcast live to a live
audience for this shot for this event
you've got our control booth over here
we have live score updates so we
actually already finished the super PI
32m portion of the competition and now
all of the teams are about half an hour
into the 3dmark11 competition right now
looks like team pier isn't it is in the
lead at this moment but it was actually
a team i believe it was team over the
edge that took the super pie 32 million
portion of the
competition let me just have a look at
the scores really quick here I had 26
257 yes I believe that they were the
winners for that one so remember the
super PI 32m is actually only forty
percent of the total score and 3dmark11
is sixty percent of the total score
here's the command center other command
center where I'm doing my live broadcast
and right now my partner in crime regime
cronin SI is I interviewing a couple of
days and I think that pretty much covers
everything I want to destroy you guys
here I'll just take you around to have a
look at some of the tables where these
guys are overclocking in real time right
now so you've got an msi gtx 580 running
with and in the side big bang xpower and
an intel core i7 980x extreme edition
processor right now they're playing
around with their temperatures to make
sure that they're getting the optimal
balance between the lowest possible
temperatures and not going down too low
so that they run into any instability or
cold bug issues let's see i thought i
had someone over here do is upload
toward games his lot in order to bring
the temperatures up a little bit you can
see everything is getting pretty bosses
over here it's kind of
cruise around and see what else is going
down I think I think one of the teams
over here actually had some volt mods on
their gtx580 so this is one of the
crazier looking setups I don't want to
get in the way here so yeah please do
step in front of me if you need to last
thing I want to do is disrupt these guys
as they maintain the delicate balance
that is required for this kind of
overclocking so they're trying to get
into windows right now it looks like got
paper towels all over so that's ghetto
fabulous of course that you can see the
liquid nitrogen oh that is boiling away
there under the immense heat load that
is an overclocked intel core i7 980x
though thank you for checking out my
video don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips and i'm going to have more
coverage coming to you guys from CES
2011 here
