interesting benchmark run not because
I'm running my typical Battlefield Bad
Company 2 test sequence but actually
because I am not running the card at
stock speed right now I am testing an
overclocked setting on the gtx 560 TI
twin froze or two from msi and that
overclocked setting i think is going to
impress you so what I'm doing right now
is I'm getting things running pretty
warm so that we have an accurate
representation of what this card is
going to experience in a gaming
condition in terms of temperatures in
terms of noise levels and I guess if you
want to throw the camera close to the
card while I'm sort of honing AI noobs
here that should give you some idea
approx out loud it is like it's not it's
not like a hairdryer like if you guys
remember the video I did where I cranked
the GTX 580 up to the maximum fan speed
so I believe the fan speed is running
out is about 55% which really isn't that
bad and wait until you see what
frequency we're running out on this GPU
because it's a bit of a milestone
frequency if you know what I mean so
yeah yeah the FPS are good although it's
hard to it's hard to really compare when
you haven't seen my original benchmark
run but I'll tell you guys now I'll
spoil one surprise is that performance
is a good ten percent or more better
than at stock speeds although I've only
done one benchmark run through with the
overclock setting so there's a little
bit of plus or minus because I am doing
a custom run-through rather than running
a canned benchmark so there are
advantages to doing a custom run-through
and that it's more representative of
actual gameplay if you're a total noob
and you play like me with the new tube
but the drawback is that the results are
less consistent so you do have to do
more run throughs to get something
usable so I'm actually done the run
through here we all know I never started
it because I had my FPS in the corner
the point is this when we close the game
we are running at a GPU frequency of one
gigahertz okay I have not touched the
REM temperatures have not gone over 62
degrees which according to our
temperature probe here the room temps
are 26 so that's only about what 30 35
36 some odd degrees Delta between the
room temperature and marmax low
temperatures fan speed as I mentioned
before I never went above I said 55 it's
actually 58% which is quite respectable
so yes the gtx 560 TI Twin Frozr 2 from
MSI was able to achieve an overclock up
to 1 gigahertz on the core and you can
actually see the voltage were using I
don't know if I need that much voltage
because I'm just kind of tinkering
around with things and dialing it in I
can probably do it with less volts than
that but even pumping volts like that
through the GPU the temperatures still
barely break 60 degrees so that's pretty
cool so thank you for checking out my
little overclocking video on the geforce
gtx 560 TI Twin Frozr 2 from MSI</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
