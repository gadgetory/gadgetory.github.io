I know I'm really late on this one the
Corsair Flash Voyager go is the easy way
to move photos music and videos between
your Android device and your PC click
now to learn more yes
everyone in North America is drooling
over the Samsung Galaxy s5 the HTC m8
etc but honestly the Moto G was never
about being the best phone available in
North America anyway so why don't we
approach this from a bit of a different
perspective let's consider its
importance in another market one that
Motorola talked about back when they
launched it India the 16 gig version
launched earlier this month Android 4.4
KitKat rolled out there on it about a
week ago and at the time of filming this
the Moto G has 2300 user reviews on
flipkart.com more than the Galaxy s4 and
HTC One combined so as interesting as
the successors to those products are I
would actually argue that even today you
know for months latest as I am the Moto
G is a more important product overall
for the world's move toward smartphones
than either of those two successors so
the main difference between the Moto G
and the Moto X are as follows
performance is lower in every way slower
CPU and GPU with a quad-core a7
processor at 1.2 gigahertz an Adreno 305
GPU one gig versus two gigs of ram and
Wireless versus AC wireless and 3G
cellular data maximum versus LTE being
available on the X all of that though
actually sounds worse than it is more on
that later the build quality is very
solid it is thicker and uses noticeably
cheaper plastic but you do get a
removable and customizable replaceable
backing now however difficult it might
be to get off it's got a regular 720p
LCD display versus the OLED display on
the Moto X that enables the display to
power on only the pixels that are needed
a great power saving feature it lacks
the always listening voice activation
and this actually bothered me a lot more
than I expected the camera
feel straight out of 20 10 megapixels
and Jigga pixels aside my iPhone 4 to my
eyes anyway actually take similar
quality pictures and does it with a
faster response on the shutter but
that's me losing track of the product
positioning of the Moto G I'm
complaining the camera is competitive
with the iPhone 4 but that still passes
for apples value option in India that is
with the Moto G is up against and on
flipkart.com the 8 gig iPhone 4 actually
costs about 50 percent more than the
Moto G whose other advantages vastly
outweigh that one disadvantage in my
opinion
let's talk physicality in everyday use
she don't have many buttons Cap'n I like
the top three-and-a-half millimeter jack
it's easy to pocket but I found the
positioning of the camera lens a bit
awkward for taking pictures in landscape
mode the on-board speaker is suitably
loud for watching youtube videos in the
back seat of a moving car which is all I
really asked for but it's got that
awkward positioning that requires the
now classic hand cup maneuver to achieve
optimal performance blah the volume
rocker is another thing that bothered me
a fair bit throughout the time I use the
phone it's short cheap feeling and hard
to differentiate from the lock button
when you're not actually looking at the
phone when you're just trying to feel it
I don't have much to say about the
software that I didn't already say in my
moto X or Nexus 5 reviews its Android
4.4 and it's pretty much stock Android
with no real bloatware there are only a
few things that really drove me crazy I
also don't like the dialer at all
dialing by name is something that I take
for granted now and is conspicuously
accident absent here and switching to
the address book is up at the top of the
phone where it's not really convenient
to reach one-handed and finally hangouts
still just plain sucks as a messaging
app the chip in my head though tells me
that much like the YouTube comments our
Google overlords will address it at some
point in the future so it's a minor
concern but it's definitely something
that's bothering me for now but
negativity out of the way let's get into
the first of my top 4 Moto G advantages
versus cheaper and even similarly priced
phones from off-brands and other premium
brands like
Samsung alike software updates Motorola
promised and delivered Android 4.4 in a
timely manner on the Moto G many of the
devices in this price range are still
running 4.1 or even earlier versions of
Android and when you consider Google's
focus on making their OS run faster and
lighter with each iteration you could
argue that software updates are even
more important than getting better specs
on your phone in the first place
advantage number two performance other
stuff in this price range like the
Samsung IAT 260 is just plain laughable
compared to the Moto G even coming from
a premium phone games ran fine at native
res and I only know two slowdowns while
multitasking or while installing apps in
the background I also suspect that any
of the stutters I did feel were because
the flash storage was almost completely
full the entire time I had the phone
that will hamper the performance of even
the quality flash storage in the Moto G
I used an 8 gig but I would really
recommend the 16 gig for another 20
bucks if you plan to put lots of apps or
even a small to medium music collection
on your phone advantage number three
that screen where most of its
competitors are still advertising their
screens as tft-lcd
without even specifying a resolution on
the product page the Moto G's 4 and a
half inch 720p IPS screen is the design
choice that even made me forget some
times while I was reviewing it that I
was holding a device that costs a third
of my daily driver the HTC One the
viewing angles on it are excellent the
colors are vibrant without seeming
oversaturated and unnatural like some
OLED displays and it was even easy to
use outside nice and bright excellent
contrast my only complaint here is that
the touchscreen seemed to lack the
pinpoint accuracy of some other products
I've used which was noticeable and
things like typing very quickly
advantage number four is about the other
stuff the all-day battery that got me
almost through to light usage days last
weekend the Gorilla Glass 3 front cover
and the lip on the front of the phone
that means I can put it down without
worrying about scratches the
customizability you can replace the
backing with a color of your choice or a
flip starting
fifteen bucks and these are all little
things that maybe don't merit individual
advantages but they add up to make the
conclusion for this video very simple at
a hundred and seventy nine to 199
dollars this is the only phone that
really matters in much the same way that
at three hundred and fifty dollars the
Nexus 5 is the only phone that really
matters yes you can find imperfections
in both of them but the only way to fix
those complaints is to spend more so I
believe what I said stands I wouldn't
consider recommending something else to
my mother if she had two hundred dollars
to spend which is about the strongest
praise I can give a product oh wait
right sorry the part of a phone review
where I talk about call quality it's
good actually better than expected the
Moto G has an extra mic for background
noise suppression which at this price
point is a very compelling value add
just like everything else about this
phone so overall great work Motorola oh
and I also have a sponsor message to the
internet sensation danboard is now
available as a portable battery charger
for your mobile devices you know like
this one when you need more battery life
on the go
and while cuteness is subjective price
to performance is not at the moment
this version with a massive 10400
milliamp hour battery and five-star
rating is available for 35 bucks on
amazon.com it includes both a one end
and a 2.1 amp charging port which can be
used separately or even at the same time
an LED battery level indicator and
automatic shutdown functionality for
when the battery of your device is
finished charging so you don't over
charge it there's a 6000 milliamp hour
model - that's similar other than being
physically smaller and replacing the
more standard battery life indicator
with get this color-coded LEDs in the
eyes anyway they're both available on
amazon.com and I'm including a clickable
link for those of you with annotations
enabled as well as a link in the video
description for those of you who are on
your phone or have them off or for
whatever are the reason so take a moment
to check it out because without our
sponsors and Thank You Chi Rho for
supporting us on this video it would be
very difficult for us to keep making
videos so guys especially this one very
very compelling value right now anyway
thank you for watching my moto G
review like this video and share it if
you liked it dislike it if you disliked
it we do value your feedback leave me a
comment and let me know if you'd like to
see more coverage of lower end devices
like this one or if you'd prefer I just
stay in the realm of sexy drool-worthy
flagship phones instead I would actually
love to hear what you guys think about
that and as always don't forget to
subscribe to lioness tech tips for more
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos even though we don't really do
unboxings I have to revise my outro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
