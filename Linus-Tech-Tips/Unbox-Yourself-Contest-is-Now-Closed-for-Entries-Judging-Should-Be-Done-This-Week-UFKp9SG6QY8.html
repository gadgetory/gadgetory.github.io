absolutely no word for me whatsoever on
the unbox yourself contest yes we are
still running it yes I'm incredibly
impressed with all tons of the entries
that we've received it's really blowing
me away there's tons of people who have
created their own content including
soundtracks I'd say that out of all of
the YouTube submit a video response
contests I've seen the quality of the
entries for this has been just blown
away anything else that that that I've
encountered in the past so i think i
have one of the most talented subscriber
bases on the interwebs and I've got some
sort of honorable mention videos to show
you guys here I've narrowed it down to
like check this out okay we got about a
hundred and eighty submissions and I
narrowed it down to 79 that were pretty
good so these are all the ones that are
going to be submitted to cameraman crazy
Russian and the NCIX artist for raiding
and I've selected my top 10 basically
what's going to happen is everyone every
video that makes it into everyone's top
10 is going to be a finalist so after
that we will announce all of the
finalists and once that's done we'll
make some kind of decision about how to
go from there we might do it as a vote
between the four of us or we might do it
as a vote and let the community decide
not sure where we're going with that but
let's see why don't I what I'm going to
show you guys just one that I thought
was pretty pretty hilarious here so
let's see spent a lot of today just
watching these videos just outstanding
so I'm going to skip a little ways in
for this one
please note that is an actual door if
you freeze the frame here you can see
it's not a solid wood door but that
definitely hurt so I do admire the
dedication of of many of the many of
them the video artists here who have
submitted videos I mean this one is
pretty uh pretty good too they tape them
into a box a very good very good I was
really impressed with some of the some
of the younger the younger fans that
have submitted videos you can't really
understand what the kids saying through
the microphone on the camera I bet but I
thought this one was pretty amusing the
kids like nine he ends up stuck in the
box and decides if he lights a fart he
might be able to get out on it glitched
okay fail YouTube
about that was pretty amazing that was
pretty amazing ah so yeah good luck to
everyone and hopefully the the three
other voters will be finished fairly
soon and I'll be announcing a winner
hopefully sometime in the next week or
so exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
