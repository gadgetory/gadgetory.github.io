limited edition t-shirt and in-game
items for planetside 2 click now to
learn more welcome to a bit of an
unconventional unboxing rather than
unpacking or unboxing the product I am
actually wearing the product already
which is the travel vest for men and the
performance t-shirt from Scottevest this
is actually a suggestion from Ed zl--
one of the employees here at Linus Media
Group that we check out these products
because they're kind of for tech heads
who carry around a lot of electronics
with them so this is what I look like
probably the only thing about this
product I'm a little bit dubious or that
I thought I'm a little bit skeptical
about is carrying the the fact that it
says you can carry a water bottle in it
and still have it look not bulky I think
the water bottle is a bit of a stretch
so now I'm starting to look a little bit
more normal I think without that water
bottle so there we go guys I am going to
unpack all of the electronics and stuff
that I have in this vest in this t-shirt
I'm going to put it all on the table and
y'all are going to be pretty impressed I
think so first of all in the back there
is a large pocket that you can put
pretty much whatever you wanted so we
use this as a place to put yes a notepad
and paper just in case you want to use
that archaic technology you could
actually fit more stuff than that in
there in the front there's large pockets
in each breast so we've got a Bluetooth
keyboard just in case you need one of
those as well as a 2 amp wall wart for
charging USB powered devices and then
that pretty much does it for the outside
however there is one kind of cool
feature here so that is yes there you go
your key attached to a nice little
stretchy cord here you can remove this
from here you can stuff it back in there
whatever you prefer and then the pocket
on the other side I don't think we
actually put anything in there no we
didn't so we missed a pocket I'm very
very sorry for that
yeah there's 24 pockets in this thing
and let's go ahead and reveal where the
magic happens
so starting on this side we have a phone
or mp3 player pocket so we've got a
Motorola MOTO X in there we have a
zipper pocket over here
is optimized for something like yes
sunglasses all right let's go ahead and
then they've also got ha ha your own
cleaner that has a map of where all of
the pockets are in the vest so it's made
from a light breathable material it's
got a Teflon coating on the outside so
it's stain and water resistant so it is
actually an article of clothing that you
know you might reasonably be expected to
wear besides being able to carry all
this stuff in it it's not cheap it's
around 120 dollars for the vest and then
they've got you know lots of other
similarly priced stuff on their website
in here this is the pocket optimized
camera so we put a light meter in there
in order to simulate what a camera might
look like there's also aa yes right
there a separate pocket for your SD card
or your other flash card so that's a
we're right there in the pocket camera
then that's it for the pocket camera I
think there's that's it for this side
yeah there we go
all right so oh yes this is called
Nolton there's a pen can't even remember
all the stuff we put in here all right
so there's some cable management spots
here so you can actually run headphones
using their personal area network or pan
system in order to have them just kind
of sit and be pretty much embedded in
the clothing on the other side we find
the other end of where we've actually
hooked up the pen so you can see there's
loops that you can run all the wires
through there's actually little hidden
spots that you can run them through as
well if you want to be a little bit more
fancy about it so you can see there's
another one right here so you can run
things right in the clothing but we did
this pretty quickly we've got another
phone in a pocket right here so I'm
going to go ahead and unplug that it
should be noted that this material is
designed so you can actually use the
device through it so here we can do a
quick we can do a quick demo of that
there we go
alright so they want you to be able to
you know quickly actually look at things
so that's pretty cool if you had
something like a moto X that has voice
control even when it's in standby yo
okay Google now you can actually go
touch it alright this is where things
start to get really impressive I bet you
guys did not notice that I was carrying
a full-size 10 inch tablet in my article
of clothing and then there's also some
other little pockets in here so you've
got some wire management
you've got their personal area network
stuff in there as well another pen
pocket over here on this side
little ID pockets so if you have to show
your ID to anyone you don't even have
necessarily have to take it out of your
vest great for traveling one of their
suggested uses for this for this thing
is to just take it off at checkpoints at
the airport and then you're ready to
rock you just throw that in the thing
and it's got all of your stuff in it
already I can't even remember how to get
at the USB Drive pocket any oh yeah here
it is all right so the USB Drive pocket
is over here in this corner so you can
throw a USB Drive or any other similarly
small little piece of electronic dude
adness and then okay there's my idea
think we're getting pretty close to the
end of this one except oh yeah there is
another breast pocket and I even had a
not that okay it's not legal to carry
these concealed and you normally
wouldn't you know do that but there's a
baton in here as well so there's another
thing we had stored in it they have
conceal and carry whatever if you have a
permit they have gun compatible devices
or I don't even know what to call this
thing gun compatible clothing as well so
there you go we had all of that in the
vest that I was wearing before that you
know with their with the weight
management system that they implement so
they okay they call it no bulge
technology so it's designed to not look
that much bulkier you only have all that
stuff in it and I think it works
reasonably well they've also got what
they're calling our weight distribution
system where they distribute the pockets
so that it doesn't feel like one side is
just being pulled on as long as you
populate it somewhat evenly and it does
seem to work with that said with this
much weight and stuff in it when you're
running around or anything like that the
vest does tend to jump a bit you know
and and there is some additional weight
to it but at least it's well balanced so
let's go ahead and take the vest off and
that leaves us with the performance
t-shirt honestly something like this is
probably more up my alley where it feels
a bit more a bit more natural it just
kind of looks like a t-shirt other than
the fact that of course it has hidden
pockets so down here I have concealed a
card reader as well as a portable
wireless media storage device so this
will allow me to beam content to a
tablet or phone of which I
carrying several I also have yet another
phone concealed in my see another pan
council that's in the t-shirt as well so
your earbuds are ready to go at a
moment's notice
and I have yet another phone inside here
so I have an HTC One mini in this pocket
up here in the shoulder and that my
friends is finally it thank you for
checking out my unboxing and I don't
know I like would you even call this an
unboxing I don't know of the men's
travel vest from Scottevest as well as
the performance t-shirt which is made
out of kind of a lightweight dry fit
material so it should be moisture
wicking it's quite breathable quite
comfortable let me just see if there's
anything that I missed so I talked about
no bulbs the weight management system I
available in a variety of colors I asked
for black because I'm a very boring
person and there you have it guys not
cheap but definitely very cool so I'll
move anything that wasn't being held up
by the clothing there we go don't forget
to subscribe to Linus tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos like the video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it and leave
a comment let us know what you think
about this and other sort of you know
electronic lifestyle friendly clothing
actually recently got an Nvidia hoody at
an event that I was at and one of the
things that I liked about this was that
all the pockets are actually accessible
and all the zippers work so my Nvidia
hoody has a pocket here that there's no
physical way to use both of your hands
to access it so it wasn't actually very
useful so this one it seems very very
well thought out
