series solid-state drive this is the non
desktop upgrade pack so we're gonna find
out what is inside the more value
oriented packaging that doesn't include
the Norton just at myself Norton Ghost
software or the SATA cable and the power
cable or the three and a half inch to
two and a half inch adapter kit ok so
inside we find the samsung manual a
digital samsung manual as well as an SSD
so this is more like an OEM drive that
comes in a retail box now the Samsung
830 controller is unique in though I
mean if you've watched my unboxing of
the 512 gig desktop version you probably
know all of this but Samsung is in a
unique position where they actually
build and design every aspect of their
entire drive nobody else does this
Samsung is also number one in the world
for SSDs and SSD components which is
very very cool they do a ton of OEM
business besides just selling to
individual end-users so odds are if
you've used an SSD at some point you
didn't know what it was there's a very
good chance it's a Samsung Drive moving
along the 8:30 controller is also one of
the fastest controllers in the market
and does not rely on compression
algorithms to achieve its speed they use
high-speed flash which they've been from
their own fabs and they make sure that
they get the highest quality and the
fastest speed stuff then they use their
own designed and own manufactured
controller to build the drive and
achieve the best possible performance by
cherry-picking everything for themselves
they give themselves an advantage over
anyone that is using any sort of a
Samsung component that they buy from
them in order to integrate into their
own solution so the drive is a slim
drive which means you can mount it in
whatever you want including notebooks
that don't accept the slightly thicker
drives and some of them especially with
the way notebook form factors are
slimming down these days don't it also
has all the standard mounting holes so
you got you two on the side you two on
the other more different side and your
four on the other more different bottom
you have a SATA power connector on the
back as well as a SATA 3 gig see the
three six gigabit per second data
connector here and these tribes are
fully capable of
using that six gigabit per second
connection by the way as well as your
Samsung branding on the top as well as a
beautiful brushed aluminum finish on the
top of the drive the one thing that I
wanted to point out is be careful when
you're installing this don't get your
grubby fingerprints all over it find
somewhere awesome to put it inside your
case where you're gonna be able to like
see it like just use you know velcro to
like mount it somewhere that just looks
awesome because it looks awesome I mean
if you're gonna have high performance
stuff that's like all like chromed and
brushed and stuff you might as well look
at it all day right so don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos thank you for checking out my
video on the samsung 830 series SSD that
comes in the non-full upgrade pack but
just the the OEM bare drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
