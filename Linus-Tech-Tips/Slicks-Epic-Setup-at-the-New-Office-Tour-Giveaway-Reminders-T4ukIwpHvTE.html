Intel Core i5 46 70k unlocked processor
add an Intel 520 series SSD to your
Haswell system for unbelievable overall
performance welcome to my video tour of
slicks new benchmarking den you can tell
that slick works here because there are
shoes that are big enough to be clown
shoes if I were to wear them see look
what happens when I put on his shoes on
oh it's wet Oh gross oh okay well let's
head up to the let's head up to his den
we're in the new Linus Media Group HQ
here and I just want to remind you guys
the WD contest that we have running for
watching our Computex coverage of
Western Digital don't miss any of that
if even 5,000 of the people who watch
this video click the playlist in the
description and let it run through that
will be 25,000 more views which
contributes to us getting bigger prizes
to give away now we've talked to WD and
we can do a minimum of the 25,000
average views per video prizes which are
a bunch of Western Digital drives but if
we hit more views we can get internal
drives to giveaway we can get puget
gaming systems to give away an even a
staggered Dynamics media center gaming
system to give away free of charge which
is very very cool and the thing about
the Steger dynamic system is those guys
are awesome guys check them out on
facebook facebook.com slash Tiger
dynamics also we've got our HTC phone
giveaway that I want to remind you about
before we go into slick room here just
so guys we're giving away for HTC phones
unfortunately not HTC ones but there's a
bunch of other cool options check the
link in the video description for more
about that and as a last reminder follow
Timmy tech TV on YouTube for a chance to
win a 900 d you also have to be a member
of the Linus tech tips forum but I don't
think it's much to ask for a chance to
win a 900 D from Corsair so without
further ado here we go this is the case
age in which we keep the legendary Slick
himself you can see he's got the most
stylish ceiling fan that any of us have
ever seen before in our lives with
little past luckily picked us out
himself you know is in the house no
actually it wasn't I'm pretty sure you
picked this out pretty sure that that
I'm the one they'll be listening to
because I'm hosting this video and for
what it's worth
18:1 so over here we have slicks closet
which you can see he is clearly out of
inside we've got water cooling crap up
there so there's actually a pile of
radiators that you probably can't see
because I don't think b-roll has the
angle for it there there we go pile of
radiators
we've got testing here this is really
not the optimal way to store
motherboards sir um what I'm trying to
show people around our test setup and I
got motherboards stacked okay well
here's our heatsink pile as you can see
we have a lot of LGA 1155 1156 and 1150
heat sinks because they're all the same
so they start to pile up after a while
this is apparently rags on what is this
what I asked for new shelves didn't give
me new shelves I had to go it with
something to store all this stuff in
this room to store all the rags well I
mean what's on these nothing okay
alright use them more water cooling
stuff down there including another
radiator which is like that massive nine
by 120 mil one so a bunch of fittings
and cool and here there's monitors on
the floor here so we've got we've got
Ben Q's low response time gaming monitor
there 27-inch 3d as well as Samsung's
27-inch 3d 120 Hertz like cool 909
Series one we've got test bench number
one which is on a bench that is clearly
designed for me to not be able to use it
at all because it's out of height that's
about even with my nipple so it's kind
of uncomfortable to stand here and use
it and this isn't that keyboard is what
keyboard is this this is yours no did
you really take one no you can't have
this for the test bit I should have come
in here before we were filming this you
you can't have this for a test bench
that blues on it of course it's a small
slip lens of course that's okay well
couple 3d monitors here just in case we
have to do any 3d vision testing down
here some stuff we still haven't
unpacked so each of these has a cute
sink of some sort on the inside we
didn't want these to get damaged while
we were moving so this is a I don't
remember what heatsink this is but it's
a pretty pretty beefy one's got like
sixty pipes under there we've got our
UPS which also isn't hooked up jeez man
I thought I set up the benches before
you actually gave me okay that's true I
gave you the UPS at the last minute over
here we have test bench number two and
so we've got some video card stuff that
we're running on here for an undisclosed
potentially upcoming video card selects
wallet actually I know he doesn't have
any money so I guess there's no point
looking at it Slick's workstation which
is his own personal computer this are
you really going to try and make a test
bench out of this that motherboard is
just resting there because I can I don't
have shelves or anywhere to put anything
yes okay this is the RAM pile so we've
got some Dominator Platinum's the Linus
Edition memory these are all the dead
bonus edition memory some whoops well
that's the living one but might be dead
now some Crucial Ballistix patriot
memory all are knocked to a fan is that
we use for our cooling test bench which
of course as you guys know these are n
FF twelves these are my favorite fans um
moving right along
how did this chair get even fit in here
with all this stuff here okay I'm gonna
move this out of the way of poor b-roll
he's trying to oh right
video card pile so there's all the video
cards pretty much every video card
that's been released for the last couple
generations is down there with the
exception of the 7990 which is
downstairs because I just unboxed it
then we've got the cable bin which has
every cable you could possibly imagine
in it including some things that are
clearly not cables has a cable attached
to it mind you here's the pile of
motherboards as well as our standardized
cooling test bench a wireless part for
some reason and a scale because the
video production is clearly not the only
kind of upper
here that's a kitchen scale that is not
the other kind of scale
all right then finally we've got a couch
so slick and I are gonna probably we
think we haven't actually finalized it
but we probably should because the
streams tomorrow are going to be using
this couch and this table and this CRT
for the live stream so you can see that
even though this is a very small space
in fact you can go up there and so to
get some perspective for how how very
small this space happens to be we are
planning to use it in the best way we
possibly can which of course is to film
as much stuff in here as as we can to
make use of our new lightest beauty of
your base key we've also dug the couch
master out of the mothballs
which is the gaming desk thing so this
is our solution for how we're going to
how we're going to keyboard mouse things
when we're we're gaming or how we're
going to run laptops well around the
stream or whatever else see can set up
uh yeah this is a w7 from a six-o tablet
notebook combo things and I can kind of
go there and I think that pretty much
wraps it up guys stay tuned for more
tours of the various parts of our of our
new HQ and don't forget to subscribe to
- tech tips for unboxings reviews and
other computer videos let us know in the
comments under the video if you likes
this sort of video cuz I don't think
we've really ever done much loggy style
stuff like this and yeah like the video
do all of those things that are very
very helpful for youtubers like me and I
guess he's sort of a youtuber now
doesn't look like one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
