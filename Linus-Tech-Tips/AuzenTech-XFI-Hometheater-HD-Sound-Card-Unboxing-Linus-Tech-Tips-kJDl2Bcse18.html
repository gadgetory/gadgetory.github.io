the awesome tech x5 home theater HD so
this is the very first sound card or
well I think there's one other one but
this is the first one to do it correctly
for support for Dolby true HD and DTS HD
master audio so what that means is when
you're playing back a blu-ray movie
there's absolutely no down sampling you
are getting the audio exactly as it is
recorded most sound parts are not able
to do that so let's get this unboxing
going on another thing it's not listed
on the front is that it's important
scott support for hdmi 1.3 HD audio
pass-through so here we go this is an x5
card so that means that it's using the
creative x5 chip and let's get it
started here so on the side this is even
labeled for us check that out so we've
got the bundle pack and then we have the
x5 home-theater HD so why don't we do
the bundle pack first yeah we'll do that
okay so let's find out just exactly what
comes with this sound card it's a very
expensive sound card so it better come
with some good quality audio and some
good accessories here so first of all we
have our breakout cable so this is where
you're gonna get all of your standard
analog connections so you got your side
front rear sub line in and mic ports and
those all come out of kind of a serial
looking jack on the sound card okay so
then we have an optical cable this is
kind of a sweet-looking optical audio
cable because yeah it's clear that's
that's pretty neat actually okay next we
have a DVI to HDMI adapter okay so comes
ready with one of those that's pretty
awesome and then we have an HDMI cable
this looks like it's about a six foot
cable 6 foot HDMI cable and then we have
oh this is interesting
ok so sorry that was a Toslink
fiber-optic digital cable and then this
is the adapter for it so there we go now
now we've clarified that okay so what
else do we find in here here's your
installation CD so that's got your
drivers on it
probably gonna want to download the
latest drivers for something like this
anyway then you've got a little pamphlet
including a 10% discount at CyberLink
comm so you can grab power DVD 9 which
you will need for blu-ray playback it's
not done natively in Windows Vista or
Windows 7 and then we will find a quick
installation guide so wow that doesn't
seem all that quick but it's in multiple
languages so let's focus down on what
we're actually going to be using here
which is English for me anyway so that
just shows you where to plug in all the
stuff to the back of the card that's
very interesting let's get the far down
Oh
alright so here we are pulling out
careful the sound you are about to hear
is extremely real that is an awesome
warning and I love it ok here is the
sound card itself the home theater HD
quality assurance seal tape that right
off quality is no longer shirt not
fitting that's not how it works ok there
is the back of the card so the first
thing you notice about this is that it
is a PCI Express 1x card now you can use
a PCI Express One X card in any PCI
Express slot whether it's 1 X 4 X 8 X 16
X so that's really good flexibility
there here is the analog i/o so that's
where we plug in that breakout cable we
saw before this is the do to do
headphone out it's right there so does
this card actually have an amplified
headphone jack is the question that I
should be asking myself yes it does this
has an onboard headphone amplifier so
that's terrific if you're using
headphones that have the high impedance
ok so digital out is right here then
we've got our HDMI out and our HDMI in
so what that means is from your video
card you're gonna go DVI out into the
HDMI in here and then it's going to add
the audio so that's where you're getting
the lossless audio algorithms and added
basically it's it's it's an encryption
device basically so you can't do it with
any previous sound card because that's
where it's all done is right on the
sound card then HDMI out will carry the
video from the DVI the audio that's been
added by the processor on the sound car
out to your receiver so let's have a
look at the front of the card here so
here's where you're gonna find your
front plugins so if you were to plug in
any I believe creative has like a front
bay that you can plug in to that right
here we've got a spit of in so if you
have to plug one of those in that'll go
there at the top there's a few little
fingers and to be perfectly honest I'm
not sure what those are for
and then right here this is one of the
features that AHS and text cards are
very famous for so this is a swappable
stop socket for your op-amp so what that
means is that you can actually take this
out if you prefer a different one to put
in there so a lot of guys are doing that
with these cards anyway that's pretty
much it for the x5m theater HD thank you
