at the door saying they have a cake to
deliver that requires two people to
carry it but when those days occur well
you know what I say I say it's time for
another episode of the mail room oh no
it's stuck to his face
the GTX 10 a Declassified edition from
EVGA utilizes their a CX 3.0 cooler and
offers enhanced power distribution
learn more at the link in the video
description yeah oh I'm probably ruining
it I'm probably ruining it now I'm
definitely ruining it oh okay okay so
it's fairly obvious from the start who
sent this it looks like our friends over
at LG are up to their usual tricks
that's a fairly recognizable Signature
Series g6 TV something I'm actually
working on my review of at this very
moment and let's see what other tricks
they've got up their sleeves wow that is
something Oh way they've got the Lambo
on here so they've got the Linus tech
tips logo they've got the Lamborghini
complete with orange rims Wow that is
hard I don't know if that edible
I've definitely fondant not the most
delicious uh not the most delicious type
of cake but certainly the one that you
can do stuff like this with I guess got
a SmartWatch in there and then this is
kind of interesting so these look
identical to a pair of salt shakers that
my parents got for me and my wife
because I'm white and she's not quite so
white and they hug together but I don't
know how they could have possibly known
that unless they're also making the same
joke I'd say probably the most
incredible part of this cake though is
the stunning accuracy with which they
have rendered my sandals
see it's basically a perfect likeness
although you know you know what hold on
I realized I wasn't wearing my work
sandals today see now it's bang on I'm
supposed to change into my endorse shoes
when I get to the office but I forgot
this morning so our first package is
from Jules from France one of the he
admitted it himself terrible people who
found my phone number on the internet
and called me out of nowhere
but it's okay I forgive you because this
is freaking sick look at this
it's a Linus tech tips of one z0 to
three months the timing is perfect
because hopefully he knows this
otherwise if he thinks is my size yeah I
have a baby coming in six weeks now
freaking awesome but also got in here
some French candies some other more
different French candies all right we've
got some caramel candies and what's in
our last bag here
oh that's awesome my baby won't have to
wear anything but Linus tech tips
branded apparel exactly the way it
should be done thank you very much Jules
this one sounds like it might not have
survived the journey
Oh fascinating so this is from an
anonymous sender who saw my video
recommending that people not pop the
lids off of their Intel processors you
can check out that video here who found
a cheap tool that enables you to safely
and easily do it so there you have it I
now have my very own Intel CPU deleting
tool whoo gift wrapping how pretty
no card though
as in lunch - what an odd thing to send
the Google store hi Linus we noticed
that you're a Susan watch - didn't
survive your scuba dive so we wanted to
hook you up with a new one ah so when I
was filming the saltwater phone death
challenge I inadvertently
left on my Zen watch - which actually
lasted for most of the diamond was
pretty impressive and I posted a picture
later on social media showing how
incredibly dead it was well thank you
Google store and thank you also for the
very tasteful towel that I will surely
wear to all of the fanciest occasions
that I attend oh that is very cool so
Thomas along with a couple of questions
one why did Andy go with our X instead
of our 9 it's because X is a Roman
numeral 10 for their newest generation
graphics cards another about why does
Apple name their products the same thing
year after year which I unfortunately
can't answer sent me a couple of not a
couple of sorry one of these is a piece
of wood but a like a wood burning
impression of my linus jobs profile
picture that is absolutely fantastic
next up is something really really cool
this is from actually our subtitling
group for China that does all be
captioning on the videos that we upload
on Billy Billy and yuku and this is the
past indicator they actually came and
visited us here to hand-deliver this one
but I still wanted to include it on the
mail room because the thing is actually
just incredible so they're using
authentic tubes from the 60s to the 80s
these were used as readouts for a
scientific for scientific instruments
they had they actually set it up for me
ahead of time but look at that all the
characters
are in a separate plane inside the tube
and then it illuminates them little
clock inside these are handmade by some
Russian company they have a promotional
YouTube video so freakin cool they've
never had one of them fail which is
pretty neat they've made I think 2000
clocks now this was a very surprising
and incredible gift so closing out the
packages we have a bottle of Blair's
death sauce that is apparently for
Terron unfortunately he's out of the
office today but I'll be sure to pass
that along to him as well as some
letters so we've got hot the guy who
sent me the 50 P point with the kappa
face on it and the long letter from last
time asking me to follow him on twitter
best of luck with that we've got this
weird one that had like a a meme inside
and a request to listen to his mixtape
from someone from Oakville no return
address on that one because he's a
sausage sausage Savage sorry our next
one is from Delhi India it kind of blows
me away whenever people who live in
countries where English isn't even the
dominant language are writing in to tell
me about how much they love the show
that is freaking awesome I got a really
cute kind of it's kind of a postcard ish
shape thing but it doesn't look like a
postcard from 12 year old Jonathan who
apparently just loves what we're doing
and has his own YouTube channel Mike
from Ireland writes in to tell us that
we are class which is a slang that I am
not personally familiar with but I think
you probably knew that given the whole
as we say in Ireland bit at the end and
finally a letter oh this is from the
same guy who sent in the the Blair's
chilli sauce this is from Edward
nordella who actually used a typewriter
to send me snail mail I mean if that is
not if that is not dedication to getting
a message to me then I don't know what
is actually okay hold on a second I lied
I do have one more letter this is from
Nitro blast and this one says open on
Wham show Lena what Nitro
doing that I'm opening it on the
mailroom so you can just deal with it
let's see what we got here I went to the
effort of making this so please show
people on when show kappa 1 2 3 from
