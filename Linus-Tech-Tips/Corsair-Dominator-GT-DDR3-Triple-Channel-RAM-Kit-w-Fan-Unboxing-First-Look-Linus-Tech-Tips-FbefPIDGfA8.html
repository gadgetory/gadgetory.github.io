unboxing of a memory kit and I saw this
and I just had to unbox it cuz it's so
like shiny and cool-looking I've never
seen Corsairs packaging that looks like
this
so they've completely redesigned the
packaging for the dominator GTS it is
now like three times
well not three times it's a little bit
taller and then they've also worked in
like a bubble in the clamshell for their
Dominator airflow fan which is a special
edition dominated gt1 because you can
see that the stickers are red that makes
it go faster and the red on the modules
also makes them go faster so there you
go now through the back of the box you
can now see the serial numbers for all
of the RAM modules that's a change
they've made lately and I'm I'm not sure
exactly why but it doesn't really matter
so you can see there are three sticks in
there they talked a little bit about the
Dominator GT family it represents the
ultimate in performance technology their
Dominator GTS actually weren't even
available at resellers to start with and
they're hand tested okay let's here we
go the optional airflow fend not really
optional and it's included right in the
box but it includes two 60 millimeter
fans to provide imp engine air flow to
the memory subsystem
that sounds high-tech anyway alright
let's get this thing open here we go I'm
going to unbox it okay why don't we do
the fan first I think I've had a look at
the Dominator airflow fan before but for
the benefit of anyone who hasn't already
seen my unboxing of the Dominator
airflow I might as well just unbox it on
account of this is a special edition red
one anyhow alright here we go if I can
get it out of the bubble wrap there we
go okay so on the bottom we find there
two fan clips which I'm not a huge fan
of having to attach these yourself get
it a fan but you take these these thumb
screws and then you position yeah it's
really awkward you position these under
here and then you actually screw the
thumb screws in from the top to attach
the two clamps and then you put the
clamps over your over your memory slots
and it kind of looks like that from the
top down I mean they've got a really
nice
on this thing nice brushed aluminum
finish to the top plate the fans are
there reasonably quiet they're better
than the old Dominator airflow module
but they're still not the quietest thing
in the world although you can turn them
down and they use a reasonably good
quality sleeving on the fen sleeve here
it's not the best I've seen but it's a
lot better than what you tend to see on
on a typical cheap fan all right they've
blacked out the stickers on the bottom
here so that you can't see what brand
the fans are but it doesn't really
matter all right there we go now let's
bring out the ash look oh I get it
wow I'm stupid I've seen this pack
before all they did is they took this
pack and a fan and they put it together
very clever Corsair Touche all right so
how do I get this open oh I need a knife
oh yeah there we go I'll just use a pen
because pens are always handy I always
have a pen in an office it's very
difficult to go into an office and not
have a pen anywhere in the office
because then people couldn't write
things unless they use pencils and I
don't think I've used a pencil since
elementary school it was very long time
Intel Core i7 Extreme Edition checkmarks
so these are ready for the extreme
edition and if you're not buying an
extreme edition processor I don't know
where you get off spending so much on
your memory so that makes sense okay so
here we go we've got Dominator GT the
module itself why don't we just take
this out of the box and then so yeah
unlike their normal dominators the
Dominator GTS have a special edition red
heatsink up on the top oh this is
interesting I've never seen this before
I have to admit I have no idea what this
is for there's a little pin out on the
memory module maybe it says something
about it on the box absolutely nothing
ok well here if you can leave a comment
saying either if you know what this is
for or if you have some idea what this
is for it's actually on it's on all
three module
and yeah I don't know what that does
okay so anyway you've got your standard
240 pin ddr3 pin out along the bottom
here you've got again your standard
Dominator heat spreader along the side
and like I mentioned before it's a
special edition red top I believe
Corsair does three colors black red and
blue depending on which kit you're
buying and then on the side you can see
they've got a slightly different sticker
from the normal Dominator one with the
GT and it is red so that'll go really
nicely with an EVGA classified or
another bright red and black accented
motherboard so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the corsair dominator
GT triple channel kit turn that around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
