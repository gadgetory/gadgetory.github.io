generally more compact over time and
that's a good thing
who wants to carry a bunch of crap
around with them just to listen to music
well sure thinks you might and if you
got a chance to listen to their que se
1200 electrostatic earphones yes you
heard me right
electrostatic earphones for that I
mentioned that they're two thousand
dollars you might actually agree with
them this is going to be interesting the
N Paulo 5/9 headphones are an affordable
way to listen to your music wirelessly
on the go check out the link below to
win one of these in our giveaway
the shure KSC 1200 s are not your
run-of-the-mill in-ear monitors for
starters they've got this thick kevlar
reinforced cable that's designed to
isolate each of the two conductors and
then that plugs into a matched amplifier
that you must use through this obscure
push-pull lemo headphone connector that
you'd be more likely to find on aviation
or medical equipment than on a
smartphone but why what is it about
these earphones that makes all of this
necessary the answer is in the drivers
inside each earbud the actual mechanism
that transduces electrical energy from
your source into Sound Energy on your
eardrum uses a technology that is rarely
used in speakers seldom used in
headphones and almost never used in IMS
these have electrostatic drivers now the
vast majority of speakers out there use
dynamic drivers where electricity
flowing through the cable interacts with
a permanent magnet to move the diaphragm
back and forth the goal is for the
diaphragm to only move along one plane
back and forth like a piston but dynamic
drivers struggle to do this because the
cable is only fixed to the diaphragm
around its dome allowing other parts of
the Flexi ER to warp in other directions
this introduces distortion which hurts
sound quality but this doesn't happen
nearly at all with electrostatic drivers
because the diaphragm is not physically
connected to the voice coil instead it's
actually suspended between two stators
like a sandwich the diaphragm itself is
made of an ultra low mass plastic film
which in some cases is actually even
lighter than the air that it's
displacing and it's impregnated with an
electrically conductive material and
then held in place by a strong
electrostatic field created by a
high-voltage power supply ah that right
there now we're getting to the bottom of
this
that is why the KSC 12 hundreds need
this amp so as the current carrying the
music flows through the stators work
together to push and pull the diaphragm
back and forth thousands of times per
second and it's really really fast
because the diaphragm weighs so little
so that's awesome for creating clear
tones even when there are lots of
instruments playing at once
it also lets the driver produce
frequencies across the spectrum so the
KSC 1200 s use only wonderful range
driver per earphone with a frequency
response of 10 Hertz to 50,000 Hertz
well beyond the range of human hearing
this is in stark contrast to most
high-end IEMs which deploy anywhere from
one or two to eight drivers per your
phone so that each one of them can focus
on a more narrow frequency range so
that's some cool tech but most people
don't pay two grand just to have cool
tech in their pocket they have to
actually sound good and subjectively
these don't sound good because they
sound fantastic honestly it's kind of
like having a tiny band playing a show
for one inside your head and and that's
not just because they're electrostatic
in ear monitors basically means that
you're kind of wearing earplugs with the
KSC 12 hundreds purporting to block out
up to 37 decibels of ambient noise
provided that you choose a sleeve that
makes a good seal in your special
snowflake ear canal so I prefer the
really really small ones there are four
different sleeve types in the box and
these im's should be compatible with the
same sleeves that fit any other modern
sure se style earphones they also come
with the cable clip two different
lengths of aux cable for connecting to
your source and to live strong style
bands for rapping sure actually no it's
not for that it's not for holding
everything together but on that subject
what we do you would even is this set up
like couldn't I just
connect the amp to my phone the answer
is yes yes you can but it might feel
like a bit of a waste because the song
or podcast that you're listening to is a
digital signal that has to get converted
to an analog signal by the time it hits
the headphones now your phone does have
a digital to analog converter or a DAC
built in but the audiophile argument
would be that it's probably of such low
quality that it kind of defeats the
purpose of your $2,000 headphones so
while yes it is possible on many iOS and
Android devices to output the pure
digital signal bypassing the onboard DAC
again you'd need to add a DAC into the
chain because the KSC 12 hundreds do not
have a DAC built-in in fact that's what
differentiates the KSC 12 hundreds from
the KSC 1500s that launched back in 2016
for $1000 more both the amp and the
headphones themselves are the exact same
but the system included an integrated
DAC and equalizer which you could tune
with the help of an OLED screen now
those functions are still available to
KSC 1200 owners but only through a
companion app so depending on your setup
you could have a source like a phone
plugged into a dedicated DAC plugged
into the KSC amp with the headphones
then plugged into your head or you can
use a combination source and DAC like
the m9 that our friends over at Pheo
graciously sent us so with something
like this you can stream from supported
apps it runs Android but it's actually
still quite locked down or you can load
your lossless audio tracks via microSD
so you've got high quality links across
the entire chain all the way to your
ears but the question is if you need two
or three devices you know zip tied
together in your pocket is this solution
really portable now I mean for old folks
like me this really doesn't seem that
cumbersome I mean I used to carry a
discman around at school every day and
by Kary I mean delicately caress so that
it wouldn't skip but
paired to this generation that grew up
just using their phone for this stuff
which we all have to carry around anyway
it is quite an adjustment with that said
relative to other hi-fi solutions this
is downright miniscule and having them
on a plane is an absolute godsend
unfortunately there's more to
portability than just size you don't
normally have to worry about battery
life with wired headphones but with
these you do because they don't operate
without the amp and while the 2200
milliamp hour battery provides more
playback on these than the KSC 1500s 12
hours up from 10 that's still a lot
lower than many bluetooth headphones
that can push 25 hours or more plus you
got to manage the source and DAC
batteries which is just more hassle more
things to recharge every night what
really irks me is that this $2,000
device doesn't even have fast charging
over USB type-c no it's got this
stone-age micro B connector and takes
three hours to fully charge the device
and come on you guys
so bottom line should you buy these
headphones their sound quality to size
ratio can't be beat and I might even
choose them over audiophile like over
ear headphones just for the added sound
isolation that in-ears offer I'm a bit
of an inner sky not to mention that
they're easier to wear to bed than over
ears which is something you could
realistically do like these were very
comfortable for me over long periods the
wire here is formable so you can get a
nice snug fit around your ear there's a
light to tell you if your input signal
is gonna clip and they absolutely nailed
the sensitivity and feel of the tactile
volume knob but I'm stopping short of a
recommendation here for the same reason
that I've never recommended that anyone
buy a Titan graphics card or an extreme
edition processor
I mean sure they're the best but they're
an enthusiast product in the truest
sense of the word a product that not
only has a low price to performance
ratio but also one that asks the user to
make affordances that would be complete
deal-breakers for a lot of people
including a little old me speaking of
little ol me little old me is gonna tell
you about the firm we'll take a 500
aluminum mid-tower case our sponsor for
today's video
it features a minimalistic approach to
the design with a brushed aluminum
surface for a clean uninterrupted look
hinged tempered glass panels on both
sides of the case and space for
radiators of up to 420 millimeters it's
capable of fitting up to four three and
a half or two and a half inch hard
drives inside the left side panel or on
top of the PSU cover and the IO includes
a type C port check it out today at the
link in the video description so thanks
for watching guys if you dislike this
video you know where that button is but
if you liked it hit like get subscribed
or maybe consider checking out where to
buy the stuff we featured at the link in
the video description to be clear I'm
not saying don't buy it I'm just not
saying to buy it I mean if you got two
grand to blow like I can certainly think
of Dumber things it's been that kind of
I was at I was at the airport on my way
back here from a recent trip and like
they have purses for like four thousand
dollars they don't even have
electrostatic drivers in them they're
just dead cow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
