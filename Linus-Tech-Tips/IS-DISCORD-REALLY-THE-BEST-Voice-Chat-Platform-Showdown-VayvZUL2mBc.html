then came Ventrilo Skype bubble and
skipping over a bunch of platforms that
no longer exists discord
so is discord legitimately better on top
of being newer or is it just another
flash in the pan
let's find out after I talk about
today's video being brought to you by
razor comes that items I'm just kidding
razor comes this gun it's be quiet there
white dark bass pro 900 features a
modular design to support a variety of
layouts and configurations check it out
at the link below
we'll begin with a quick rundown of our
competitors teamspeak and mumble are
both what are called self hosted voice
and chat platforms both of them require
server software either running on your
desktop or a rented server in a data
center somewhere and both require you to
be actively connected to receive
messages Skype and discord by contrast
are hosted by Microsoft and discord
respectively both of them allow you to
send messages to friends who are offline
they'll just be delivered later and both
offer video chat in addition to voice
they are structured a little differently
though discord is more like a social
network so you can join an existing
community or make your own
while Skype operates more like your
address book so like your phone you
start a conversation by scrolling
through your contacts list and selecting
one or more of them okay so now let's
talk design a usability both teamspeak
and mumble share a theme that's
reminiscent of the beige PC cases of
decades past though you can skin them
well discordant skype are much more
modern this is an aesthetic advantage
but it should be noted that while Skype
does have a more conventional desktop
app the Windows Store version that
Microsoft is pushing users towards has
generated many complaints about it
actually being too simplistic to the
point where it makes it confusing to use
adding contacts for instance is done
through the search Skype box rather than
intuitively by clicking on the plus
button so do yourself a favor and don't
use the Windows Store version this
Court's designed on the other hand is
both beautiful and functional every
server that you are a part of is
displayed in the left tab along with of
course your direct messages and my main
gripe with discord is just the lack of
joint voice and text channels has it's
kind of jarring every time your friend
says yo check out this link and you have
to ask which channel to their credit
though they finally added channel
categories which is great but all this
ignores a huge factor so far caused
teamspeak has a number of paid licensing
options and if you don't buy one of them
you are capped 232 slots
mumble on the other hand is open-source
and completely free with no slot
limitations Skype is free for up to 25
simultaneous users over the Internet and
if you want to call conventional phones
allows you to pay for a subscription or
a la carte for that service and this
cord seems to be taking the Silicon
Valley social network startup approach
their core service is free for as many
people as you want and according to them
that's how it's gonna stay though we'll
see how that goes after the insert
multinational here acquisition anywho
let's get to what matters most for
gamers how do they all sound to answer
this question for you guys once and for
all
Jake used three common microphones a
blue Yeti to represent the higher end a
pair of HyperX cloud twos to be a
typical headset and a mod mic five
because it was on his desk at the time
each test clip was played through a host
computer and then recorded on the other
end this is a test recording on the blue
Yeti every quality setting was cranked
to the max and we turned off both echo
and noise suppression YouTube's audio
compression though may make it
challenging for you guys to hear the
differences so if you're interested in
the raw clips
we'll have them available for download
in the description we'll start with the
Yeti
when discord is working well more on
that a little later it's basically
indistinguishable from teamspeak this is
a test recording on the blue Yeti
blackout Edition while both mumble and
Skype have a higher noise floor but
you'll notice if you listen very closely
this is a test recording on the blue
Yeti blackout Edition switching over to
the cloud twos we can hear that the gap
between teamspeak and discord compared
to mumble and Skype is more noticeable
with lesser source audio this is a test
recording with the HyperX cloud 2 gaming
headset this is a test recording with
the HyperX
to gaming headset so mumble has a
muddier sound to it while Skype
maintains its background hiss this is a
test recording with the HyperX cloud 2
gaming headset then the story completely
chaste stays the same actually with the
mod mic teamspeak and discord are very
clear
while mumble and Skype are slightly
worse so okay it seems like you can't
really go wrong with teamspeak or
discord as long as that one's working
let's talk about that as a regular user
our writer jake has noticed a pattern of
degraded or robot e voice quality on
discord it's hard to say if it's load
related or completely random without a
much larger sample size and it can
usually be fixed by temporarily changing
the region of your server but it's one
of those things that happens often
enough that it is worth mentioning let's
move on to admin control this varies
wildly across all four platforms Skype
groups are basically limited to kickin
and banning while mumble teamspeak and
discord offer fully fledged rank and
permission systems teamspeak definitely
takes the cake for having the deepest
customized ability but it does come at
the cost of the time required to set up
and learn the system discord on the
other hand is much easier and there
isn't much that you can't do with it so
for most people it's probably the way to
go here but security is another big
consideration because teamspeak and
mumble are self hosted and can be
encrypted all the data on your server is
yours and no other party can access it
without your permission discord and
Skype on the other hand both connected
to their servers and while discord says
they don't sell your information
according to their privacy policy they
can share it with related companies so
that's just something to keep in mind
Skype of course is a similar story and
ARS technica reported that Microsoft may
be snooping for example the URLs the
you send in chat on to overlays another
feature not to be over looked teamspeak
has an excellent in-game overlay
supplied by overwolf
that gives you access to an easily
repositional basically fully functional
teamspeak window while in-game mumble is
much more limited by contrast but at
least does show you which users are
talking in your channel discord shows
you who's talking and allows you to
switch channels or servers on-the-fly
and also has some great integration with
twitch so you can auto sync subscribers
and even show who's talking on stream
talking talking talking leaving us then
to the final answer what is the best
voice platform out there well in terms
of pure sound quality it's hard to
compete with team speaks reliable
clarity but discord sounds just as good
most of the time and I think our poll
response numbers indicates what our
viewers think of its excellent chat
system and community building features
if you're looking for an open source
solution with top-notch security though
mumble is probably the way to go
and as for skype well at least the IP
address resolving nonsense is finally
fixed and it's blue so if you like the
color blue then you should probably also
still use one of the other things we
talked about
speaking of using other things why not
use fresh books instead of be
complicated accounting software that
you're already using fresh books is
cloud-based so you've got access to it
from anywhere whether it's your desktop
or even their fully featured mobile app
and it has tons of great features you
can create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds you can
set up online payments with just a
couple of clicks you can see when your
client has seen your invoice putting an
end to the guessing games and their tech
support is freaking awesome
you call them someone picks up and you
actually just talked to a person
no phone tree no nothing so try it out
