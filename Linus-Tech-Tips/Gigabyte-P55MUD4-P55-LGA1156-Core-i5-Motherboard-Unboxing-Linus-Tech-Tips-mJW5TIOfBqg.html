doing unboxings of p55 motherboards
we've got the gigabyte p 55 m UD for now
you can see from the front it's got
smart six three year warranty and ultra
durable three which means a two ounce of
copper PCB along with these other
features you can you can read about them
we also have support for Dolby home
theater ATI crossfire X and nvidia sli
so let's get to the accessory package
here we have four SATA cables and one
IDE cable then we've got an SLI bridge
then we've got an IO plate we have the
user's manual and then we've got the
driver and application DVD then we have
a multilingual installation guidebook so
this is guiding you through the physical
installation more like a quick guide
than a full user manual here's your
smart 6 user's manual and my phone is
ringing that's okay alright so now let's
get down to the board it's pulling out
my Oh what you'll notice about this
first compared to all the other p55
boards that we've looked at so far is
that it is actually a micro ATX board so
that means it is shorter but you have
quite a complete feature set and it
looks a lot like a high-end board so
we've got a multi-phased power solution
around the socket 1156 and then you've
got quite a robust cooling solution on
the MOSFETs I'll get kind of a nice
angle on that there it's kind of neaten
Aztec looking and then up at the top
left corner in its rightful place as the
eight pin power connector along with the
24 pin over on the top right corner
like all p55 boards it supports dual
channel ddr3 ram but unlike all p55
boards you've got support for 8 X 8 X
PCI Express
SLI and crossfire which is great to see
on a micro ATX board it's the first one
we've looked at like that now again
keeping in with the high end feature
theme we've got onboard power reset and
clear CMOS switches and then we have 7
SATA ports it seems like a weird number
but when we look at the back plate here
you'll see why because on the back we
have one of those eSATA
and USB combo ports so that's where your
other SATA port is now then we've got a
ps2 mouse keyboard combo port 10 overall
USB ports digital audio firewire Gigabit
Ethernet and 7.1 audio so thank you for
checking out the yeah I forget the name
again p55 m UD for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
