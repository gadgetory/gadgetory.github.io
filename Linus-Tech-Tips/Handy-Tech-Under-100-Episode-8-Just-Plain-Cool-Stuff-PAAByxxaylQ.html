episode eight we're just about anything
can happen as long as it happens for
under hundred dollars and also isn't
lame we never let anything lame on this
show which oh you're gonna go there you
you want to go there alright alright
that's it I'll throw down here are three
unassailable arguments for my socks and
sandals are the world's most optimal
Footwear one the coarser HX 1,200 I
power supply delivers 80 plus platinum
efficiency for quiet efficient power and
corsair link digital for advanced
monitoring and control click now to
learn more about here
so our first handy item of the day is
one that would have come in handy many
times at the office when we've resorted
to hanging cables out the sides of our
systems using the Frankensteined remains
of ripped apart external hard drive
enclosures or crossing our fingers and
hoping one of those USB to SATA adapters
will manage to supply enough power to
the drive we happen to be trying to read
from this is the Thermaltake black X I
honestly have no idea how to pronounce
it so I'm going to go ahead and call it
the blacks the concept is simple but
quite frankly most of the options on the
market are just not very good and my
personal blacks has served me so well
that we reached out to Thermaltake about
equipping each of our editing stations
with one of them for quick ingesting a
footage shot directly to an SSD
we actually have a few cameras that do
this but the application of these
badboys goes way beyond pulling files
off of cameras they're great for
troubleshooting borked pcs so you can
try to fix issues or pull important data
off with out or working OS they're great
for archiving data if you use hard
drives kind of like VHS tapes and if you
pay a bit extra for the duet then it's
even more flexible because you can use
it as like genomics
drive enclosure with two mounts instead
of one for your usual nightly backups or
whatever else the case may be
drive compatibility is a strong point
for the blacks with only our native 4k
Sector Seagate Enterprise Drive stumping
it and if I had to complain about
anything else it would be that the dual
drive one doesn't feature separate power
switches for each Bay so adding or
removing a single Drive will momentarily
disconnect the other Bale though I've
yet to see a dock that handles this any
differently item number two today is a
totally fun one from Tek cheese and it's
actually kind of a variety of items we
have here with a common theme ultra
small driverless programmable keys for
your PC or for your Mac now the original
concept was kind of a unique PCB
business card with a micro controller on
it where each of the keys spits out some
information about the manufacturer when
you press it then from there came the
tech Keys programmable card which unlike
the business card and thanks to the 7 by
24 LED array built right into the board
can be easily reprogrammed by holding
down program for 2 seconds selecting the
key you want to program then using the
arrow keys to select which characters
you want cool right not as cool as the
tetris game Easter Egg that I'd be lying
if I said I didn't waste a bunch of time
tinkering with at my desk while I was
supposed to be writing this review
anyway neither of those are really
finished products intended for end users
although you can buy them along with
cool key caps on their site exposed PCBs
are not a safety hazard with low
amperage 5 volt power to them but
they're certainly not durable so let's
take a look at the one keyboard and the
three keyboard that these earlier
experiments inspired the concept is
simple - sweet little aluminum housing
from nude C and C with a PCB mounted to
the bottom that gives you either one or
three fully programmable keys that can
be used for anything your heart desires
from single inputs to frequently used
passwords not that I'd recommend that
particular use to Windows or program
specific shortcuts to long micro change
with modifiers like ctrl + Shift just
hold down any one of the buttons for
four seconds with a text editor like
notepad open on your computer and
watch as the instructions for
programming the device appear magically
which leads us to the magical device
that allowed us to take the following
footage walking up and down stairs with
an iphone check out how steady that
looks isn't walking footage with phones
usually total crap how is he doing
oh all right there's nothing oh there's
nothing magical about a gimbal but this
particular one is affordable easy to
stuff in a bag and just a downright cool
little mobile accessory it's called the
stable cam and it's about the size of a
folded umbrella and works a little
something like this
you slide your phone into the smaller or
the larger the surprisingly slip
resistant slot depending on your
device's thickness then you decide if
you want to film at body level or down
low or up high then you hold the device
horizontally by the grippy ring and pull
the weighted end out until it balances
you put the whole thing up right and
then you nod your phone left or right
until it pretty much holds still then
holding it like this and supporting the
bottom shaft with your little fingers it
is off to the races the whole process
does take a minute or two every time you
want to balance it but considering the
difference in the results it's pretty
safe to say it's worth the extra effort
if you're into not having your phone
video footage look like total rubbish
the footage you're looking at right now
was actually shot on the galaxy s6 edge
at 1080p 60fps then that was slowed down
to 30 for even better stability
pretty cool huh so closing out this
video the last thing is the full
disclosure part that I like to include
with handy tech the blacks actually a
number of them for our new office was
provided by thermal tape but I already
owned one that I'd picked up for myself
a couple of years ago and the stable cam
and tech keys were both provided by the
manufacturer without any obligation to
review them if I didn't like them but I
did so here they are guys thanks for
watching like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you thought it sucked
leave a comment preferably on our forum
