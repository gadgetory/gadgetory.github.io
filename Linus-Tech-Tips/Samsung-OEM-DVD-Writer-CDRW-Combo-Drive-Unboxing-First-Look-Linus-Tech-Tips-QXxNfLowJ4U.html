continues today I will be unboxing a
Samsung saifa DVD writer now this model
is the sh s two to three but this has
meant more as an unboxing to be an
illustration of exactly what constitutes
an OEM DVD drive so as you can see in
the product description here I'm just
gonna go ahead and take it out of the
box
thanks well the bag whatever you want to
call it it's basically just the model
name DVD writer SATA black om you'd be
able to read that if the O wasn't cut
off by a barcode so what om means is
this is what you get you get a drive
original equipment manufacturer you do
not get any mounting screws you do not
get any SATA cables what you get is a
functional drive at an extremely good
price because most OEM units are gonna
cost less than half of what you'd pay
for a retail drive and considering the
fact that when you're building a system
your case is going to come with all of
the screws you'd need to mount a bunch
of optical drives anyway they don't
bother to provide that stuff your
motherboard comes with SATA cables and
so on and so on you get the point so the
only thing that these drives tend to
come with is a bag an elastic holding
the bag shut which mine doesn't even
have and a quick installation guide so
you can see they show you unplug your
computer from the wall slide in the
drive plug in the power and off to the
races now something that they sometimes
come with is like a trial or demo or
partial version of a burning software
this particular one does not but some of
them do thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the SH - s2 2 3 and pretty
much all OMD Drive DVD drives because
they're all gonna look the same five and
a quarters drive there's your mounting
holes I guess I haven't really done this
in detail enough there's your button to
open it up and there at the back is
where you will find these SATA interface
power and data</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
