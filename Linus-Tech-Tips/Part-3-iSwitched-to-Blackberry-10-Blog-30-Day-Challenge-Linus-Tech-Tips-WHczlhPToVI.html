air to learn more welcome to the third
installment of my blackberry I switch
this installment as you can see I have
Ted on my blackberry is all about side
loading android apps so there's two
different main ways of doing this
there's the google chrome app way which
you can click here and find the tutorial
for that on crackberry or there's the
DDP bway which you can click here and
find that tutorial for that on
crackberry both these ways are actually
fairly similar when you get down to it i
prefer the google chrome app way because
i just find it simpler and easier to set
up although the DDP bway is not actually
that complicated i just find google
chrome one more streamlined so the first
thing you're going to want to do is to
go into google chrome apps and install
playbook app manager leave that up on
the pay on your page or bookmark it at
least and then go to your blackberry
phone go into security and privacy and
then go into development mode after
enabling this it will give you an IP and
you're going to want to jot that down
somewhere and you want to set your own
password which it'll also prompt you for
at this point you're going to want to go
into the chrome app enter the IP for
your phone which your phone gave you and
then enter the password that you set for
developer mode and that will connect the
chrome app to your phone then you will
go to this website there are other ones
but this one's pretty good in my opinion
it works and i like the crackberry
community so that's good and pick ba our
files ba our files download the
different ones you want the ba our files
are all for like whatever programs are
going to use I got stuff like winamp and
Google Maps and Ted and Instagram and a
few things like that you can get
whatever you want those things like a
hundred and eighty apps on that list or
something like that it somewhere on
there that's probably wrong but well um
yeah and then basically you just drag
and drop those bak file or ba our files
sorry after you've downloaded them into
the google chrome app and the google
chrome app will install them for you
when it's done installing it'll say
success when it's done tank success just
disconnect your phone from your computer
and you're good to go i once had to do a
restart of my phone to get the app to
work
that might have been an isolated case
I'm not sure but it would worked fine
after that I expected this whole process
to be actually a lot harder than it
really was I did have problems with
google maps and Instagram but what I did
was I went into the Google Chrome App
uninstalled the two that I had
downloaded different ba our files than
the ones that I had initially downloaded
tried installing those and they both
worked fine so there's different options
for some apps i think Google Maps has
like two or three or maybe even four
different downloads that you can choose
so if one doesn't work for you just try
another one it's really not that long of
a process to uninstall something I
reinstall it once you have the whole
process set up one thing is if you
restart your phone you do have to go
back and developer mode as far as I know
there isn't a way to keep your phone in
developer mode there might be I haven't
really looked into this just as a heads
up and other than that they didn't run
into any problems he was actually really
easy this is unrelated to sideloading
apps but is a problem that I ran into
before I decided to start sideloading
apps I tried to update the system
software on my phone I tried to do the
system update and it said it was
interrupted I didn't interrupt it I
don't know anything on the phone that
would have interrupted it I looked up
this problem and there was a lot of
information on it which can be a good or
bad thing for this one I read through it
a bit but didn't have a ton of time and
I didn't have a ton of information on my
phone so I decided the fastest way to
fix it would be to just factory reset my
phone if I looked into it further I
probably could have fixed it but factory
resetting it was the fastest way for me
after a factory reset it worked
perfectly fine I hope the overall
easiness level of sideloading apps
doesn't actually make companies lazy eye
could see companies go uh people can
side loader app it's not a big deal and
then not developing a dedicated app for
blackberry we still need dedicated apps
guys they work pretty good but there is
some functionality that you can tell us
not necessarily tuned for the device and
I have found a few problems there there
are ways around it but it just maybe
adds a few clicks or adds a few some
things that are just not entirely
enjoyable if you currently own a black
grout highly recommend starting to
sideload apps onto your phone it's great
it's really not that hard i could easily
choose my mom to do it or maybe set it
up and then my mom could do it on our
own afterwards it's it's just it's
wonderful I wanted to talk to my phone I
want a google maps in my phone I wanted
a few other things I was able to
sideload everything I really really
wanted and now this phone is able to do
much more than it could for me before
which is great and a really easy way to
add a lot of functionality to your
blackberry I know we got a little bit
away from the weekly really schedule
these blackberry i switch videos due to
stuff like computex but thank you for
watching the third installment of my
blackberry i switched the next
installment will be more of a conclusion
just an over wrapping comment on
everything that I've done so far if you
like sideloading apps if you're
interested in sideloading apps comment
in the comments i'm sure people can ask
answer all your questions and don't
