Choice Award computer where we tell you
about the most common PC purchases from
line of tech tips audience members earn
checkout market trends and changes since
last time now all of this is according
to them what 26,000 Amazon transactions
since the start of the year on our
affiliate code holy crap it is a good
thing that I hired someone to dig
through it all for me this time anyway
last year you guys made some decisions
that I found disappointing but did you
do any better this time place your bets
so tax vr go backpack features a gtx
1070 and intel core i7 processor
allowing you to enjoy VR without
obstacles
learn more at the link below now in the
first episode i lectured you guys for
spending an extra hundred dollars on an
i7 6700 kctu after telling you that the
i5 6600 k was the best pick for gamers
in a previous video well either more of
you are content creators than I thought
or maybe no one cares what I think and
I'm living a giant lie because once
again Intel's Core i7 won the day with
the new generation 7700 k handily
beating everything else thanks to its
higher clock speeds and hyper-threading
but will that last most of you spent
between two hundred and fifty to four
hundred and fifty dollars on your cpu a
price point that's about to be
thoroughly shaken up by AMD's new risin
7 line up so by the next episode
I expect the three $29 eight core three
gigahertz rise in seven 1702 have
chipped away at the 93 percent market
share that Intel currently enjoys among
our viewers
neither the viewers choice CPU cooler
nor the RAM changed the hyper 212 Evo is
still a great performer with solid
compatibility at the same price around
30 bucks but the same can't be said for
the 32 hundred megahertz Corsair
Vengeance dual-channel ddr2 they
actually went up in price about 30
percent due to fluctuations in commodity
memory pricing but they also seem to
have gotten a strong boost since being
spotlighted last time around this
positive feedback loop might make it
difficult for incumbents to be dethroned
in future viewers choice videos who
have to keep an eye on that totally
different story in the motherboard
department the reigning champ the z170a
from a suit now to fourth place with the
significantly cheaper and lesser
featured be 150 M doubling up on it this
is really bizarre to me given the
excellent sales of K Series
overclockable I 5s and i7 don't you guys
want to use this feature that you spent
extra for I mean let me know in the
comments why do you think this is
happening this is another category by
the way that I expect to be turned
inside out as the flood of rising
compatible boards hits retailers shelves
so stay tuned for that onto graphics
town and more upset victories the
cheaper trend continues with EVGA gtx
1070 gaming smashing the sales of the
two cards that were tied for first in
our last episode AMD did make a bit of a
comeback though scoring 25 percent
market share by unit volume mostly on
the strengths of our X 480 sales and as
for whether or not putting gaming in the
cards name makes a difference let me put
it this way the first video card to not
do so came in 9th place
I don't think even special snowflake
kids get a 9th place ribbon on sports
day
speaking of podiums Samsung's 850 Evo
SSDs killed it again this time with the
lower capacity 250 gig variant leading
the charge but a challenger approaches
in third place miserly viewers sacrifice
10 gigs of storage for $30 a savings on
SanDisk's SSD plus 240 gig for folks who
broke the bank with their CPUs and SSDs
but need a cheap spinning guest to store
their steam library the one terabyte WD
blue is far and away the most popular
SKU with this
raisa me hardly anyone in our audience
buying more than six terabyte drives
from either WD or Seagate EVGA is still
in power when it comes to PS use but
this time you guys for wind the 650 watt
fully modular supernova g1 which fell to
third place and went for the cheaper 500
watt non-modular 80 plus bronze b1
Series honestly that's probably a good
move for most people you get to save a
couple bucks while still having the
option to remove some unnecessary cable
clutter an important consideration in
the tempered-glass era and in case you
were wondering the tables have also
turned when it comes to chassis
selection the enthu evolve tempered
glass Edition gets an honorable mention
here for being the most popular tempered
glass case but fantex is 400 series
cases were almost completely absent this
time around leaving the Thermaltake
versa H 25 as the most popular single
skew and the NZXT s340 in its various
colors to power above the rest am I the
only one who's surprised by this I mean
the most popular color was white go
figure
anyway if you're not a fan of these
silly segways we've been doing too bad
it's your punishment for once again
buying corsair a Series A F 120 s
instead of the more versatile sp1 20s
apparently 64% of you decided that the
four dollars of savings was more
important than listening to me so at
least we know how much my advice is
worth and finally
chacha-chacha-chacha-chow robe worn
through you moved up market in the
monitor department since last time when
commodity 60 hertz monitors ruled the
roost this time both the one and two
slots were occupied by high refresh rate
1080p gaming monitors made by AOC
and asus respectively 144 hertz gaming
is definitely becoming a thing with our
viewers deeming it as important as ultra
wide resolution with both of those
coming in significantly ahead of 4k as
for mice logitech still sits on top but
their g502 proteus spectrum lost
narrowly but lost to the more expensive
g4 o3 prodigy a wireless gaming mouse
that we covered back here the first
that's considered even by the pros to be
suitable for high-end competitive play
who would have thought a wireless mouse
in a chance against good old-fashioned
copper and your g4 3 will go perfectly
with your wait a minute this thing isn't
made by Logitech the G Chen W and Q us
be wired gaming keyboard this puppy has
been selling like knockoff air pods
since it rocked the competition in our
cheap twenty five dollar backlit
keyboard roundup even though it has
gaming in the name I didn't really
recommend it as the best experience in
that category so let us know in the
comments how that thing is working out
for you they're leading us finally to
the eternal struggle between good and
evil Coke and Pepsi crocks and sandals
and audio we had the exact same headset
showdown as before Sennheiser HD 598
versus the Kingston HyperX cloud tunes
this time the battle has been won by a
mere three points by the Sennheiser's
with as always the antlion mod mike the
more versatile but significantly more
expensive option of the two so how does
our PC compare to our last one well
again surprisingly we ended up with a
compatible computer right out of the box
which is pretty neat and it's about 140
dollars cheaper but that's only if you
remove headset spending from the
equation otherwise we saved around 35
bucks since episode 1
this penny-pinching then results in
poopy err performance not really since
most of the savings came from the
downgraded motherboard and power supply
and lower capacity SSD as far as overall
trends go it was interesting to see
intelligent videos continued dominance
among our viewers especially given the
kind of year that we are heading into
and I'd love to hear from you guys in
the comments what do you think those
charts might look like closer to the end
of 2017 so thanks for watching guys just
like if you dislike like if you like get
subscribed maybe check out where to buy
the stuff we featured at Amazon in the
video description also down there is our
merch store as well as our community
forum and now that you're done checking
out all of that stuff your fatherland
probably lives as we move probably
wondering what to watch next so check
out one of our other videos which we're
going to have like a little box that you
can click on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
