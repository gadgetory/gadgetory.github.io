Linus tech tips this time we're going to
be having a look at the phantom 630
high-performance modular full power
computer case from NZXT this is pretty
similar to the phantom 820 which we
actually had a look at not that long ago
except it has been decreased in size a
little bit and it has also been
decreased in price quite a bit so there
goes my my video switcher which I sort
of will need at some point but let's
have a look at what NZXT has to say for
themselves on the outside of the case so
here we go we got four or five and a
quarter inch bays cooling options galore
with two 200 millimeter fans included in
one 140 millimeter fan included lots of
clearance for things like graphics cards
cable management and CPU coolers and
finally some dimensions that comes with
a two-year warranty although I'd expect
that with the case there's not a whole
lot to go wrong next generation phantom
design both inside and out high-end
water cooling support allows use of
multiple radiators and multiple radiator
sizes very cool SSD mounts behind the
motherboard tray split-level motherboard
tray allowing increased rear cable
management we will check that out I'll
show you guys that on the back fully
modular internal drive bays allows you
customize the phantom 630 a out to suite
your needs I think what they meant was
soup that they tried give them credit
for it ok easily removable dust filters
illuminate your i/o ports at the back
this is cool that's a great feature
integrated high power 30 watt single
channel fan controller this has changed
and we don't have these so full external
peripherals support with multiple USB 3
and an integrated SD card reader ok so
the things that seem to be missing so
far by the customized lighting effects
so that I wasn't I'm not talking about
the lighting at the back to see your
your peripherals I'm talking about the
internal lighting that was in like you
know different colors and stuff that was
very very cool
so that's missing and then ah there we
go
that that seems to be sort of one of the
biggest missing features so we've got a
white version of the phantom 630
apparently I actually had no idea what
was inside the included foam
is quite thick so you can see it's
probably about an inch thick around the
outside edges however that's not all the
way so it's quite lightweight I don't
know if I would be a big fan of shipping
an entirely built liquid-cooled system
in the stock box I would probably want
to change it out for something a little
bit more robust but the case itself is
strong and feels rigid so far so that
will actually help compared to if you
had sort of a flimsy case inside of a
hard foam packed box go ahead and take
the plastic off here and you know what
there's actually a lot of plastic wrap
on this case so we're going to do that
off-camera and we're good to go so I'd
love to have Diesel do a nice pan of the
front panel here because we are starting
to get used to this phantom look I
remember when the first phantom launched
some people were not necessarily that
impressed with the aesthetic I
personally liked it but I think now that
we've seen it a few times in a few
slightly different variations of the
case the 410 the original the 630 in the
820 I am definitely used to it I think
it looks great and there's a lot of
practicality that goes along with it so
this is magnetic which is actually
really nice and this right here this is
a very loose mesh so you can see the fan
very clearly which shows you how loose
the mesh is you can also see there's a
lot of space between the mesh and the
fan that and there's a dust filter in
the front which I just discovered and
didn't know about okay so there you go
so that actually is there for a very
practical reason that makes it easier
for the air to pass through the mesh
without making additional noise there's
also what appears to be a dust filter
directly in front of the fan so that'll
help with things as well up here in the
front you can find those four or five
and a quarter inch base as well as the
built-in SD card slot and on the top of
the case I'm going to get diesel to film
that for me again two USB 3.0 ports two
USB 2.0 ports headphones and microphone
ah yes the other thing that was missing
from the phantom 820 is the very complex
fan controller now we've just got a
single fan controller so down middle up
that turns the i/o lights on and off
you've got power and reset switch is
here as well as in
LEDs so this right here is just sort of
you got one option or one you've got one
setting for the fan speeds inside your
entire case which I actually personally
don't mind because quite frankly think
about it this way how often are you
going to be going oh well I'd like my
CPU fan at high and I like my GPU fan at
low and in my case transit medium I
don't think that happens that often I
think you're either idling and Diesel's
putting his hand up because don't forget
it
you don't do that I think your eyes are
going okay well I'm idle I want it quiet
or on you know I'm gaming and I want to
you know crank it up so those are pretty
much the options regardless of what sort
of smart alecks on my production crew
might be saying so we're going to go
ahead and give you guys another look at
it here so again you can see the mesh on
the top is quite loose and there's one
of those included 200 millimeter fans
and I've totally got it on the wrong
camera right now so now you can see what
I'm actually talking about here there's
an option for another 200 millimeter fan
here and this is again quite a loose
mesh with a lot of space so it's going
to be very very low restriction just
great for cooling and phantom series is
about nothing if not cooling with sort
of cool looks so on the back you can do
a variety of different sort of fan
mounting options 120 and 140 and then
you can move them around as you see fit
also it should be noted that this back
piece here and it's actually going to be
easier for slick to show you this this
back piece here bulges out a little bit
so can you see that that's sort of that
there you go you can see that bulge yet
you can see it now so it bulges out a
little bit and there's a very good
reason for that it again puts more space
between the fan and the grille which
reduces noise and reduces restriction
very very good stuff
we've got ah one two three four five six
seven eight nine expansion slots so that
means that you can put pretty much
whatever whatever motherboard you want
in there there aren't many motherboards
that have more than nine PCI expansion
slots in fact I can't think of any
although if you had one that had nine
and then you needed a dual slot card in
the bottom that might be an issue but
still I expect it to be fine and you've
got a bottom mounted power supply that
looks again sort of pretty pretty
standard there so left side panel Wow
there we go
you've got another 200 mm
fan that's the other included 200
millimeter fan with the zap 3 included
200 millimeter fans now hold on just a
minute
no where's the 140 ml fan something in
here must be a 140 mm fan well let's
open it up and find out what the heck's
going on because apparently there are
three included 200 millimeter fans one
on the front one on the side one on the
top even though it would appear that the
is no three included 200 millimeter fans
there's also a window so the window lets
you see pretty much just the CPU socket
area and the yeah pretty much just the
CPU socket area as well as a rear 120
millimeter mounted water cooling unit or
something like that like if you install
something like an NZXT kraken in here
for example that would be a great fit
and it would go perfectly in there i
would show you the kraken but it's
actually on our test bench right now in
terior options so check this out you've
actually got a lot of different options
here so there's that 200 millimeter
front and fan and I can't see slicks in
my way so I can't tell which camera were
on yet we're on the right one
okay so there's that front two hundred
millimeter fan you've got a lot of other
options here as well though so you can
actually do dual 120 or dual 140
millimeter fans if you would prefer and
then what's cool about that is I can't
quite see how they come out it looks
like it's on the other side but you
could pull these drive cages out and you
could actually do you could put
radiators here as well which is very
very nice oh we're going to show you
that we'll pull this out you can also
see Oh check this oh look at this is
great so there's actually screws here so
you might have to get kind of close to
see that there's screws here so you can
pull out not only the cages but also
this guy right here which is the the
fixture that these cages actually attach
to so cable management holes here at the
back of them sliders here to mount them
and then the whole thing comes out if
you just decide who cares I'm going to
mount two SSDs on the back of the
motherboard tray I'm not going to need
anything else and that's it that's all I
need very very cool stuff cable
management holes galore so they're using
an extremely soft rubber for the cable
management holes you can see here that
it's very very pliable there you go
see that one two three so this is where
you'll run your graphics card ones this
is where you'll run up from your power
supply so that'll be down here there's a
ton of room at the back for cable
management look at that you can pretty
much stuff like my hand back there
and not take check that out hand behind
the motherboard tray lots and lots of
room this is a neat feature that we've
seen on NZXT cases before this rotating
piece right here so check that out so
that allows you to either sort of just
put either a 120 or 140 millimeter fan
there and you can either blow it up
towards the CPU or across the graphics
cards the choice is totally yours so if
I had a graphics card that for example
exhausted air this way then I would go
and I would install that graphics card
and then I probably actually wouldn't
want to do that anyway because don't be
pointing away but okay don't worry about
it
the point is point it out there point it
there the choice is actually yours
there's also another here we go fan
filter so the fan filters are half and
half you can pull out half of it from
the front and half from the back that
prevents you from having like the 800 DF
fan filter that's this long that unless
you actually keep your case four feet
away from the wall you aren't even able
to remove without lifting it up and
moving it around which with these heavy
cases can be a bit of a problem included
cables are all black love to see this
this is a good thing so we've got
there's your USB two there's your USB
other more different USB 2 there's your
and connector okay so that's for adding
I guess looks like one more fan because
the included ones are presumably oh yeah
that's for attaching the side panel fan
and then we've got front panel
connectors and USB three so we're going
to go ahead and look open it up from the
other side so you guys can check it out
and it is apparently pretty tight so I'm
going to go ahead and grab a screwdriver
which I happen to have handy the odds of
that actually were not very good I don't
usually have a screwdriver handy for
these unboxings I never really showed
you guys the construction of the side
panel so I'm just going to show you that
right now so there's a little bit of
flex to it but with a case this big
that's to be expected they're not it's
not like they've just gone and built it
out of sort of an
thin steel or anything like that
although we've seen that trick before
not from NZXT I don't think I showed you
guys the tool list five and a quarter
inch bays actually before its own no way
these are made of metal very very nice
so there you go you can hear that snap
to them and then you can also screw them
in should you so desire now this is the
second time we've seen this in the
recent past but it looks like the the
three and a half inch bays actually come
out from the right hand side instead of
from the left side this is a bit of a
unique design to me
because I would normally think of sort
of opening up the left side panel to get
it anything on the inside of the case
but I guess it doesn't really matter two
and a half inch drives go here in the
middle three and a half inch drives are
on rubber isolating mounts here and you
can see there's some flex to it so it's
designed to Bend easily there but once
you put a drive in it that'll sperm
right up and you won't have to worry
about it and sort of going anywhere oh
there's the included fan controller love
this so sorry that one's just on there
and it specifically pre run for you to
plug in that side panel you can run ten
fans off of the included controller I
think it supports up to 20 watts so you
don't have to worry too much about
overloading that no difficulties there
here on the back you can see that
there's tons of cable management space
so I'm going to get slick to kind of
have a look here where you kid there's
more than enough space to put a 24-pin
cable back here and then there's
actually some parts that pop out a
little bit more like up here with the
SSD mount is but that's not an issue
because you should be running your 24
pin here if you I don't know if you can
see this but this is out a slight slant
here so this is further in or this is
further in the missed which is further
in than this so there's a there's a
shape to it here so you run your 24 pin
over here and up here and you'll have
enough space and then there's lots of
space back here for things like your 8
pin or whatever else like that what's
also cool about the back is they have a
ton of cable management spots so you can
clip or you can zap strap cables here
here here here here here here here here
you can tell that NZXT here and here and
here and everywhere here here here
you can tell NZXT actually puts a lot of
thought into how people are going to
cable man
the case to keep all the wires flat and
make it so that it's easy to close the
other side panel without sort of
fighting with it and forcing it into
place the SSD mounts are here so they
are mounted with just a thumb screw you
pull these off put in the four screws
into the SSD and then you our website
and was on the wrong count there you go
so you put four screws into the bottom
of the SSD you put it back into place
and then you screw it back in this is a
lot more elegant than what we saw in the
define our four where you basically
couldn't uninstall the SSDs with the
case actually with a motherboard
installed because you had to screw it in
from the other side which is not really
an optimal configuration and okay you
know what we're going to do this off
camera okay I think we pretty much
figured it out so you have a number of
different options so number one is if
you so desire you can actually just
install these by hanging them from the
ceiling so there you go so now you don't
have to have anything here which means
you can pull this out and mount a
radiator on the bottom remember that's a
filtered intake so that's that's a good
thing you could also just pull them all
out so you have a single a double and a
triple giving you a total of six three
and a half inch so you can pull them all
out and you could mount radiators here
in the front okay so that that's another
option you could take your single one
and put it here
although you can take the double one and
put it there because there's no room at
the back to pull the hard drives out
this is would have been an argument you
know that I would have made at NZXT if I
worked there for mounting the hard
drives the other way because then you
wouldn't have to worry too much about
that you could just sort of you know not
worry about that and things the other
way but I wasn't there so nobody asked
me so you can also make things sort of
more low-profile here and you can have
more space here for presumably the
longest graphics card ever made the
twinky Edition graphics card because the
twinkies RC product placement maybe
we're getting money from hostess which
doesn't actually exist anymore so that's
probably not what's going on so yeah
that's pretty much it I mean you can
just sort of put a single triple one
here and
there you go you just basically bolt
them in at the back and I keep missing
here but you guys get the point it does
work and that pretty much wraps up this
particular unboxing thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the phantom 630 from NZXT which
actually is not over yet because I
didn't show you the 140 ml fan at the
back as well as more importantly the
options for radiator mounting here in
the top so you can do a triple 120 looks
like you can do a combination of no
looks like you can do dual 140 s and
then they've used slits instead of holes
so you cannot you actually have a lot of
flexibility in terms of where you
position the fans and you can do a dual
140 radiator as well and then last but
not least you can leave in those dual
200 millimeter fans with filters and go
that route now we're done
