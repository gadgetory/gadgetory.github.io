first of its kind in North America this
is the fractal design define excel so
this is as you may or may not be able to
guess an extra-large version of the
define which is on its third revision so
you can buy a define r3 or a define
Excel so let's go through the bullet
points on the front really quick here
obviously you can read them if you so
desire but here's one of the big
highlights boom 10 internal 3 to 1/2
inch hard drives that's huge that's
awesome you've got noise absorbing
material just like the define r3 thermal
chamber design we've come to expect
there mod you vent technology which I'll
show you when we open up the case as
well as an optimal airflow cooling
system so to front so included you have
140 140 millimeter fan one top 180
millimeter fan and one rear 140
millimeter fan you can check out what
you can get that is not included to add
to the case over here on the other side
we see all of these supported
motherboard sizes which is pretty much
everything although you'd have to be on
something pretty good to put a mini ITX
board in a case this size it would be
like this paint so don't do that and I'm
gonna just open up the box and we will
continue shortly now the reason I chose
this one out of all the ones in our
warehouse to unbox is that it wasn't
labeled with a color so I figured if we
unbox it then we'll also find out what
color it is it comes in two colors black
and titanium gray it also comes with a
user's manual which is pretty basic but
if you've installed a PC in a case
before you to be able to figure it out
reasonably well so there's the packing
material it's a cardboard reinforced
with pasta well not really reinforced
it's styrofoam reinforced with cardboard
for some puncture resistance as well as
some rigidity and hardware's pretty good
like a dual wall alright so let's get
the case out of its plastic sheath and
find out what we've got going on in here
this is a very large case they weren't
kidding when they called it the XL
because it's not gum but it's really big
here we go
use me for scale next to it here so you
can see a person is quite small compared
to the defining right and we can see
that this is the titanium gray version
of the defined XL so the black one would
be a little bit darker would be more
like finish on the rest of the case
although you would still have that
brushed look to the front of it just
like the r3 we've got most of our
business stuff up at the very top of the
case that means you got your microphone
and headphones eSATA four USB 2.0 ports
as well as your power switch once you
open up the door you will find some
noise isolating as well as I assume dust
trapping no it couldn't because there no
the intakes are here so some noise
isolating foam you've got four or five
different space which come off quite
easily as you can see all you do is
remove the little tab and then you can
also put me back into kind of need
actually and then behind this one look
at that you've got room to mount a 120
millimeter fan so because most people
only install one five and a quarter inch
device that makes a lot of sense so you
can put up to three 100 and these look
like 140 and then this looks like a 123
fans in the front you can see the one
has been included and I think that
pretty much does it from the front so
the intakes as I mentioned see you've
got dust filters right over the fence
the intakes are actually all along the
side so when you've actually you've
closed the front of the case that's
where those fans are gonna get their
airflow from all right let's take
actually here we'll look at the back
while we take off the thumbscrews here
no no but look at the side first wait
Maude you meant I promised I talked
about this this is a monument you see
how you can't see through it well that's
why it's my event because right now
they've got a piece of their
noise-isolating material screwed in
so you just remove that you mount a 140
millimeter or a 120 millimeter fan there
and boom now you've got air flow instead
of noise isolation so that's what makes
it Maude you go ahead and pull off the
side panel here I hope I can figure out
how the mechanism works for the side
panel on camera because sometimes I have
trouble with those okay there we go
it came off well there's our noise
dampening stuff it's quite a bit thicker
than what I've seen on the define r2
although I haven't seen an r3 in person
but there you go that's how you remove
it go ahead
Wow the panels are quite quite heavy
they are steel panels and they do have
the the noise dampening material on them
you can see they're quite sturdy and we
better take a break I got them home and
here we are on the inside of the case so
the first thing we're gonna do this is
our accessory so this is giving us a
little inventory here of everything
that's included I guess that's why that
information was not in the manual we've
also got a fan controller of five and a
quarter to three and a half inch bezel
in case you want to install a floppy
drive or a media card reader as well as
some cable ties very nice Thank You
fractal and then what else do we have in
here here's all of our front panel
connectors which should be pretty much
run-of-the-mill I think because we saw
everything that was at the front
oh this is nice they look all of the
switches are individually sleeved just
like that so they're all going to be
nice and black inside your case you
won't be able to see them against the
black interior we've got HD audio as
well as its AC 97 to USB as well as our
east side of plug so that's all taken
care of and then here is be nicely
sleeve look at that high-quality
sleeving you can't see the color of the
wires at all behind it so you've got
your nice lace leaf three pin connector
for your front end here are the ten
three and a half inch drive base so
these come on little sleds you can
install a three and a half inch or a two
and a half
device on here quite easily so this case
is entirely SSD ready you can install 10
SSDs out of the box the other six are
down here now as a water cooling
enthusiast the first thing I think when
I look down here is actually that it
probably wouldn't be that hard to remove
the rivets from these bottom cages and
amount to radiator down there so that
would be an interesting project for a
power supply we've got four little
rubber mounts so any power supply
whether you've got bottom cooling top
cooling however you want to mount it
we'll be able to get adequate air flow
although what I would recommend is
mounting it with the fan on the bottom
so that it can pull air up its own
dedicated cool air through the dust
filter here which can be pulled out to
clean just like that and yeah so it can
sit on the noise-isolating rubber melts
and what else do we have inside so here
this is what what is this this is
interesting we've got another mock event
here although I'm not 100% sure what
it's for oh okay well you can take out
this square piece and that gives you
full access to the power supply
there's my other side panel which I had
unscrewed helpfully for myself just in
case I wanted to take it off for you
guys and then most of the cables are
actually going to go up through here so
we've got a little rubber grommet you
can see the quality of the silicone
they're using here is very high so
you're not going to be putting things
through it and then pulling them up and
have it stay in place nope you're going
to be able to push these around and
they'll go right back where they belong
and then you can yeah so most of the
cables will go up that way where they're
gonna come out is a whole other ball of
wax so we'll look at that when we get
around to the other side of the case
here's that 180 millimeter fan that's
going to be cooling your MOSFETs as well
as drawing any hot air away from your
CPU socket area speaking of the CPU
socket you have a removable cover so
that you can access the back of the
motherboard and install aftermarket CPU
coolers without taking the motherboard
out here's another one 40 millimeter fan
here in the back just like the one in
the front we've got seven expansion
slots so that means you're gonna fit
standard ATX micro ATX extended ATX but
none of those weird excel ATX type
we've got one extra PCI slot here just
in case you've got a cold cathode kid or
a fan controller or something that you
want to dedicate a PCI slot in the back
to but you don't want to take up room to
install things on your motherboard just
go ahead and mount that right there
here's all of our rubber grommets all on
the side and up along the top so we can
do SATA we can do power we can do 24 pin
we can do 8 pin and that's all going to
come up and a nice convenient location
along there five and a quarter inch is
all fairly straightforward here we can
actually oh yeah there's the five and a
quarter inch to three and a half inch
adapter is actually mounted in there by
default so you can just remove that or
you could leave it in and you could
install the adapter for the front panel
that they include in the accessory box
if you look at the back of the case yet
I don't think we looked at the back of
the case yet so there's the fan there's
some venting there's more venting along
the side panel there's two holes for
water pooling although those are pretty
small you probably only be able to get
about 3/8 inch tubing through there the
power supply mount is right here and
then you got some air venting there so
fairly straightforward very clean
that's what fractal is becoming known
for is the designs are just clean
everything has a purpose and there you
go there's how you access the CPU stuff
you look at that it stays long too so
you can just put that back up there it's
got a little thumb screw no problem now
you do have adequate room behind the
motherboard train about cables that's
been one of my biggest complaints about
some of the cases I've seen that have
you know little holes to route cables
but they actually don't have enough
space back here to do it so the side
panel is way out here which means you've
got like a good inch of space behind
that motherboard trade about 24 pin ATX
connectors or whatever it is that you
need to route behind the motherboard now
there's the reset switch there's that
front 140 millimeter fan I think that
pretty much covers everything I wanted
to say about the define XL paint finish
actually on the parts that are not the
front looks quite adequate it's going to
be quite fingerprint resistant it's not
the best I've ever seen but the value in
this case for the features that it comes
with is just outstanding you get the
black interior actually I'm pretty
impressed so far
I haven't seen this one in person yet
I'd only seen it in photos and it looks
really good it looks like they've got
another winner on their hands thank you
