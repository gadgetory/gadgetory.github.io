airstation wli h4d 1300 more importantly
than the model number what does it do
this is a wireless AC media bridge so
what does a mediabridge do basically
it's a glorified Wi-Fi card because the
intention of this particular device is
just to give you a way to use your brand
new wireless AC router remember guys I
will not remember unless you've already
seen the other video which case remember
wireless AC is a 5 gigahertz dual band
1.3 gigabit per second wireless standard
this is the next generation standard
that will at some point in time be
completely replacing wireless n as what
everything is using although right now
it is still in its infancy as of the
time of doing this unboxing is in draft
2 point 0 standard however according to
Buffalo it works so very very cool stuff
um dual vanity abridge cetera et cetera
okay let's see what get buffalo has to
say for themselves so it's dual band 2.4
gigahertz and 5 gigahertz it is
backwards compatible with existing
wireless standard so it is also n450 so
450 megabit per second there and AC 1300
1.3 gigabit per second there it has four
gigabit ethernet ports on it
multi-device capable hence the four
gigabit ethernet ports it's also
multi-platform pc mac or mobile which it
should be given that it using wireless
standards to connect to things they're
showing you how to set up your AC
network so there's your home router
there's your glorified network card and
there is your wired connections going
out to all of your devices so when I say
glorified network card what I mean is
really fancy network card because you
could not only use it as a network card
and connect it via a gigabit wired
connection to one pc so you would have
in theory gigabit wireless connectivity
but you could also take it and its glory
and connect it to four devices which
assuming they were all fully utilizing
the maximum theoretical bandwidth
all still be getting about 300 megabit
per second in terms of connectivity so
that's pretty crazy given you'd be
splitting it four ways remember guys
this is all theoretical so when it comes
to wireless performance the ratings
don't include things like overhead or
interference or all that other that
other nonsense that tends to interfere
with wireless however one that is
theoretically faster than another one
theoretically is in the real world will
be faster even if those theoretical
numbers don't pan out quite the way that
we want them to so in terms of included
stuff we've got our CD connector gives
you a wizard for setting it up we've got
our quick set-up guide which basically
involves if you have the corresponding
AC router from Buffalo this guy right
here which looks a little different not
very different mind you but a little bit
different if you have the corresponding
AC router should be pretty much a
OneTouch thing we've got a couple of
little feet which will help us stand up
our little Air Station mediabridge guy
right here should just put those down
there and they slide into the
appropriately slotted spot just like
that yeah there's a better angle they go
and you've also got a power adapter
couple of screws keys for the power
adapter and finally they're awesome flat
ethernet cable that is like awesome in
every possible way we have one here in
the tech tips lab and slick and I will
fight over who gets to use it alright so
connect up to four wired devices to your
ultra-fast 11ac or high-speed 11n
wireless network once again it is
capable of both so having a quick look
at the physical unit itself we have a
reset switch on the bottom which whoops
there you go might come in handy if you
ever need to reset the device to its
factory defaults on the back we've got a
power button we've also got power in so
this is great if you want a power cycle
it you don't want to just yank the plug
and put it back in we've also got our
four gigabit lan ports and look at that
a hardware button for setting it to five
gigahertz fixed mode so that'll change
it from being in multi modes 2.4
gigahertz 5 gigahertz to just 5
gigahertz for
I remember guys wireless-ac runs purely
on the 5 gigahertz spectrum rather than
relying on the older now older 2.4
gigahertz spectrum so what that means is
slightly reduced in theory range however
the technologies for transmission
strength as well as antennas continue to
move forward to compensate for it but
also significantly less interference due
to the under utilization of this band
compared to the over utilization of 2.4
gigahertz so thank you for checking out
my unboxing and first look at the WL I
h4d 1300 from Buffalo and don't forget
