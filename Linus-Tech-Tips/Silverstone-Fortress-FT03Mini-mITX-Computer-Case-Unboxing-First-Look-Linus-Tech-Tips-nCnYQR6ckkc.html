coolest thing ever this is the silver
stone fortress series FTO three mini
okay the new desktop computer paradigm
in smaller size so they have an FTO
three it's an M ATX case however this
one is mini ITX and if you guys know
have watched a few of my videos you may
already know that I'm pretty into the
whole small things that are extremely
high performance so the concept of the
FTO 3 is to have a very unique internal
layout that allows for outstanding
cooling and very high performance
components in a very small enclosure so
you might compare this to something like
you know a wall here let's have let's
have a look at it and then we'll see how
it stacks up to some of the other
products and hopefully it's okay bear
with me here guys
oh that was clumsy it's a good thing
that Silverstone packs their products
pretty well because even when someone
like me goes in nums out and breaks it
it should still be okay because there's
pretty good foam down there
yeah not a scratch excellent ok right so
there are other products that claim to
do this whole extremely high performance
PC in a very small enclosure thing
however I would argue that the fto 3
mini is actually smaller than some of
the other ones that that claim to be
doing that so let's start with the
outside of the unit
let's take take this off first oh I love
Silverstone cases another thing that you
guys will probably know if you've if
you've watched more than a few of my
videos is that Silverstone really does
it for me with certain things that they
do like um excuse you bless you and all
that stuff like this beautifully curved
thick aluminum pieces that make up the
construction of this case that is just
amazing and then the anodizing finish
that they use on their cases I know for
a fact
is phenomenally durable because I have
one case mighty jo7 that I've had for
years that has been subject to all kinds
of abuse and the anodization still looks
amazing this one's actually just this
one's perfect Wow
just absolutely beautiful can you can
you see it can you see kind of the
finish on it this beautiful aluminum
case so there's only four pieces going
around the outside curved piece here
straight panel here curved panel here
and straight panel here what you find on
the bottom is also really cool this is a
140 millimeter air penetrator cooling
fan it is a filtered fan and one of the
things that silverstone has really
pioneered is the whole positive internal
air pressure with like a rotated ATX
layout they first did that with their
raven case and now they're taking it to
like a whole new level so if you filter
an intake and you have nothing but
intakes you achieve a couple of things
one is it becomes very difficult for
dust to get into your case because
you've got a filter over the fan and if
you have positive air fresh air pressure
inside the case it means that air can't
be sucked into these little cracks
whereas if you were using all exhaust
then dust could easily be sucked in in
other places and that's more just one
thing that you're achieving so let's
just leave it at that because I forget
where I was going with that
the filter can be easily removed all you
do is undo this go wash it in water let
it dry and then pop it back into place
just like that air penetrator fans by
the way are awesome if you didn't
already know that then you do now you
can take my word for it they're
outstanding they're some of the best
fans on the market for a couple of
reasons number one is they have
extremely good static pressure
properties so that means that if you
have just one fan and you have to push
air through something big you want it to
be an air penetrator also they're very
directional so you see these fins on the
other side of the fan blades those
direct the air to where you want it to
go where you actually point the fan
which is awesome so normal fans you can
see if you have like smoke blowing into
them they just kind of blow the air all
over the place air penetrators blow like
a cyclone
we're in a column away from the fan
itself so they will directly cool
whatever you point out which is awesome
as well rubber feet on the bottom and I
think that pretty much wraps it up for
the bottom of the case I'm going to go
ahead and fill the filter here's another
thing that's Silverstone just gets it
for certain things that other
manufacturers don't you see the big gap
between the filter and the fan that
reduces turbulence and improves the
efficiency of the fan pulling air
through the filter dramatically solar
stone a plus they know what they're
doing alright let's flip this bad boy
over and this case comes with very
specific instructions for how to
disassemble it and reassemble it comes
with a very thick book so I'm gonna I'm
gonna have to do that off-camera but I
will show you the steps as we go I just
want to finish up at the outside so slot
loaded optical drive silverstone logo in
the middle very clean very nice-looking
and then at the top you've got a very
very open mesh with a handle right here
to pull it off power reset 2 USB 3 and
front audio ports as well as your
indicator LEDs so you can pull this off
and that gives you access whoa I was not
expecting that to happen ok so no but I
guess we'll just take it off because
we're going to disassemble it anyway so
that gives you access to your power
supply so that's an SFX power supply as
well as your two expansion slots that
you get on I love one expansion slot and
then one empty slot for like a
high-performance dual slot video card as
well as your rear i/o
and you can actually see right through
to the very bottom of the case now where
that cooling fan is going to be blowing
air right up over the CPU socket as well
as directing some air towards kind of
the back of the video card where we'll
be able to get the cooling that it needs
and blow that out the back of the case
or the top of the case as well so let us
disassemble this a little bit and I'll
be back so slick and I are so impressed
with this case we're going to have to do
a high-performance build in here just to
show you guys how it all fits together
so three of the four panels just snap
off using the little rego just using
these little guys right here and there's
sound dampening here like Silverstone
really does think of everything to make
sure the panel's don't vibrate all that
good stuff in turn
terms of hardware installation it's
pretty simple actually all you got to do
is take off this cage then you lay it
down like this you have full access to
everything you need including them and
your motherboard here installing your
power supply up here this is a really
cool thing silver stuff is like the oh
man they just thought of everything on
this one check this out so it's a 140
millimeter fan on the bottom here but
they put 120 millimeter fan mounts here
here here and here why did they do that
because they left room for you to
install and they even recommend they're
like look if you're going to put a
high-performance CPU in here throw in a
liquid cooling radiator so if you use a
slim radiator such as a Corsair h-60 you
can orient the tubes here and run them
straight down along the back of the
video card over to your CPU socket which
means that the cooling in here doesn't
have to be Mini ITX level cooling it's
off the floor by enough that you're
going to have ample air flute air flu
airflow going through that radiator and
just awesome they really did just think
of everything right expansion so you do
have to use a slim slot loading optical
I mean I think it makes it makes the
front look really nice they're not that
expensive you can find them so it's not
that big of a deal so you mount that in
here you've also got room for a two and
a half inch storage drive here and a
three and a half inch storage drive here
so you can fit everything you need for a
high-performance system in this thing
without any issues high performance
graphics card high performance CPU SSD
or even up to three SSDs if you use
three and a half inch to dual SSD mount
and high performance graphics card
however there are some caveats if you
put in a high performance graphics card
you want a rear blower card so one with
the fan oriented here and blowing the
air out the back because that will
cooperate with the natural air flow in
this case something like a GTX 590 which
blows air out the back as well is going
to fight the airflow of this case so
even though the case can probably fit oh
I can't anyway well there you go so even
though the case could potentially fit
cards that have fans here blowing out
the back or here blowing out both sides
you want to make sure that you're
optimizing your can
for the case that you're planning to use
so that means fan here blowing out the
back and then you won't have any issues
I think that pretty much wraps it up
other than that yeah we're just really
going to have to do a buildin here
because this thing is amazing much
smaller than something like a bit
Phoenix prodigy however you can still
fit an unreasonable amount of hardware
in this little mini ITX enclosure from
silverstone so thank you for checking
out our unboxing and first look at the
FTO 3 mini and don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips from unboxings
reviews and other computer videos oh
yeah and I have to give Silverstone huge
kudos they're manual isn't in it isn't
in colour or anything however this is
the most complete and instructive manual
that I've seen other than the last
Silverstone one that I looked at they
even give you a full installation guide
with like lots of little tips and tricks
and how did how to actually do it not
just how to you know give you an
instruction that's sort of vague and
then walk away they even give you like
limitations here's your PSU limitation
CPU cooler height diagram and
limitations CPU cooler so here's a
recommended liquid CPU cooler here's how
to install it here's how to orient the
barbs correctly
here's your GPU coolers what's optimal
like they just spell everything out for
you and make everything really really
easy upgraded maintenance fan filter
removal guide fan foots removal guide
fan removal guide just awesome stuff
cart okay that's not my heart but you
get the point hearts on your stone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
