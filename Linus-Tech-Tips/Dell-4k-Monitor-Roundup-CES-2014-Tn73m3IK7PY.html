brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital so we've got some alone
time with a couple of Dell 4k monitors
this right here is the 24 14 Q this is
an ultra sharp display and when they say
ultra sharp I think they actually mean
ultra sharp this is actually the highest
pixel density desktop monitor that Dell
has ever produced and on top of being
extremely sharp
it is extremely color accurate so it is
has a 10 bit panel that means up to a
1.0 seven billion colors and it comes
factory calibrated to a delta of less
than two when you couple that with the
exceptional viewing angles and the fact
that it's height adjustable tiltable
pivotable swivel bowl pretty much
whatever you can think of it's going to
make for one organ ama cand absolutely
beautiful working experience now
speaking of beautiful the industrial
design of it is very traditional I
actually really like it the last Dell
monitor I bought was a 24:05 fpw and to
me this looks like kind of like a more
modern version of that with a black
bezel with slate silver accents on it
it's got touch sensitive buttons here so
you can go ahead and press those we've
seen this kind of thing before but it's
well implemented here you can see they
light up when you even move near them
we're gonna go ahead and turn the turn
the unit around so you can see how slim
it is from the side the answer not
particularly slim there's a lot of
hardware in here in order to get 3840
pixels by 2160 uses a standard vase
amount on a an aluminum stand so it's
just an aluminum base with an aluminum
stand I'll show you guys the height
adjust here and in terms of i/o you're
gonna find it's a little bit different
than usual there's no dual link DVI
there DVI is does not just necessarily
work optimally with 4k so guys it uses
DisplayPort mini DisplayPort and HDMI
those are your only options
the only other i/o we find on the bottom
is a USB 3 4 port hub which you're going
to be able to use for all your heist
connections for that probably quite
high-end computer that's running this
monitor I think I went ahead and turned
it off there but hopefully you guys
still get the point man it's beautiful
even sitting this close to it it's just
crystal clear kind of want one of these
next up we've got the Big Brother this
is the U P 32 14 Q from Dell it's got an
IPS display from sharp it's got on USB 3
hub it's got DisplayPort mini display
port HDMI and it's pretty much the same
as the 24-inch model except for the
massive size I mean you can see me
standing next to it that's funny because
I used to use a 30-inch monitor on my
desk and I got away from that because my
cat lept on top of it and it fell
forward onto something and actually
cracked the panel and so it had actually
been a while since I had seen one and
then I got my hands on a 30-inch again a
little while ago and I was like wow this
is big this is that experience all over
again now if there was one criticism
that I had of my old 30-inch it would be
that when you make the display that
large you lose some of the sharpness
that you would get with something like
you know even a 2560 by 1440 27 inch
panel just because when they're smaller
the pixel density is higher and it's
harder to pick up the individual ones
well this alleviates that problem
because this is four times the
resolution of a standard 1080p display
so that means it's about the equivalent
of looking at you know for 16 inch 1080p
displays all in one the colors look
absolutely beautiful which makes sense
because Dell is promising 100% Adobe RGB
coverage with 99 percent srgb coverage
1.07 billion color so that makes it a 10
pit panel and they are promising a delta
e of less than 2 which means that color
imperfections should be pretty much
impossible very very difficult for the
human eye to discern thank you for
checking out this video on dell
ultrasharp 4k monitors here at 20 at CES
2014
don't forget our trip to the show is
powered
NCIX calm your source for great
technology selection and service as well
as course our memory and Western Digital
without all those guys there is no way
that we would have been able to be here
so thanks so much for that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
