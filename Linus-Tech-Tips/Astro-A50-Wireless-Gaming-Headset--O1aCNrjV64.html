more welcome to the first in a series of
wireless gaming headset reviews we are
actually gonna have the H wireless and
the Vengeance 2100 coming soon but this
my friends is the Astro a 50 gaming
headset now I've been asked a lot of
times to cover Astro products but as a
member of the so called glorious PC
gaming master race I actually thought
that they were a small niche brand until
I went to PAX Prime and they were
absolutely everywhere I mean like
everyone was using these headphones ok
so i smartened up and promptly went to
see astro asked them to hit me with
their best shot so to speak and the guy
pushed me whereupon I quickly clarified
that I meant for him to send me a
headset after the show and here we are
one headset and once or gutt later now
let's go ahead and open this baby up
they actually sent over the a 50
wireless headset which is their a
premium top-of-the-line headset and it
happens to be the battlefield 4 Edition
so it comes a little stuck don't return
this to the store contact Astro for
support as well as a QuickStart guide
that you probably won't need that
because it was pretty easy for me to set
up anyway and then we also find the
headset itself the mix amp TX which is
their base station right here the
wireless transmitter and then another
piece of plastic let's remove their
packaging is excellent really like this
then underneath that we find an Xbox
chat cable we find a USB charging cable
as well as another USB charging cable
this is cool because you can actually
run one cable to the base station and
then it has a pass-through for charging
so the base station can actually sit on
the is included headphone stand and then
charge your headset from there so I'm
just go ahead and pop that out and of
course there's a spit F audio cable so
it's an optical audio cable under there
as well now construction and looks of
the headset itself with some metal in
the construction actually these posts
right here and a softer foam than the
Vengeance 2100 s that they
nice soft cloth covering the material
quality feels better than average
especially for a gaming headset they are
a little bit on the heavy side but
that's probably the sturdy metal posts
that are used for the size adjustments
the ID of the industrial design I feel
strikes a fantastic balance between
gamer II looking and pro grade with a
mostly black color scheme with a couple
of tasteful orange accents I mean I
don't know about you guys but I'd feel
pretty silly spending three hundred
dollars on something that looks like a
toy for 12 year old so I think that this
was a great way to go even though it is
a you know bf4 edition like I don't mind
getting a couple in-game items with my
purchase and a bit of a different color
scheme but I don't want game branding
plastered all over it either like we've
seen with some Logitech peripherals in
the past in terms of general features
they weigh in at 360 grams or so they
are PC Mac Xbox Playstation phone AV
system whatever compatible you can plug
in anything with an optical out or an
auxilary out into them as well as USB
and it has they have an integrated non
user replaceable battery which is
comparable to the Vengeance 2100 s but I
don't feel is as strong as SteelSeries
this swappable battery system on the H
wireless and I think that's pretty much
it for my little feature list in terms
of comfort they were not comfortable to
me at first they have very little
clamping pressure even out of the box so
there's not really much break-in and I
found them quite difficult to wear I
found that they were like falling off my
head until I tweaked the headband size a
little bit tighter than I would normally
like to do and then they were very solid
now the a 50s headband gets away with
the required tightness for a couple of
reasons so number one is it has a very
soft foam and number two even more
importantly this flexible little piece
right here it's really smart because
even if your ears aren't quite aligned
on your head like mine aren't you are
able to clamp it a fair bit tighter and
it adjusts to your head it's actually
quite nice and now that I know how to
use it properly I give them a definite
you know gold star of appreciation for
comfort the material on the ear cups
doesn't really feel like anything
chill on the ears but the foam inside is
a nice medium softness feels like a
memory foam nice low retraction so
combined with the very very soft
material here but I mean like I said it
doesn't feel like leather or anything it
just feels like a really nice soft
material they are definitely good enough
out of the box and should even break in
even nicer in the long term they are
noticeably heavier than the Vengeance
2100 s and the SteelSeries H Wireless
but particularly compared to the 2100 s
I find that because the weight is
sitting in closer to your head I don't
get as much a shake even when I move my
head quite quickly now their website has
some nonsense about wearing them around
your neck or over your head but I just I
gotta call them out on that because
they're gonna slip right off of of me
and I have a medium-sized head and
they're basically like they're hanging
off your ears at that point that's like
saying you could wear your hoodie
backwards you could but you won't
alright let's move on to the range test
for my range test I did five different
locations I stayed within the same room
so that's about 10 foot max I went down
to the other side of the wall but still
quite close I went down a hallway I went
down to the stair landing which is like
15 feet away and the wall I went down to
the bathroom downstairs and finally I
went down to the basement with the base
station itself installed in my office
connected to my laptop so this was
performed about the same as the
Vengeance 2100 for our range test
maximum volume of the Astra way 50s
these can easily get uncomfortably loud
there is no shortage of amplification
going on here so unlike the H Wireless
which actually didn't get like painfully
loud for me these ones you can drive
them as high as you want to go however
unlike both the H Wireless and the
Vengeance 2100 they don't seem to have
any kind of limiter to prevent over
driving the speakers and introducing
Distortion the 850 s just let you go as
high as you want even though it'll sound
like completely like ass once you get to
a certain level but don't worry about
that guys the distortion doesn't come in
until long after most people would be
extremely uncomfortable in terms of
noise isolation I'd say they're about
average for a closed back headphone the
cloth ear cut
are going to resist a sweat more than
something like a faux leather but what
they also do is they leak sound more
than a faux leather wood so you know
whether you like isolation or whether
you don't is up to you but I'd say
they're about average for closed-back
which is generally more isolation now
let's move on to the listening tests all
of these tests were performed using the
onboard DAC so I wasn't actually using
the analog in and a separate DAC this
gives us the best apples to apples
comparison for the way most people are
gonna use these and we use them on a PC
for sound quality I would say it is
adequate it's really nothing special
especially at three hundred dollars and
especially compared to the better
SteelSeries age wireless with that said
while the usual synth at gaming headsets
commit which is the overdone boomy bass
at the expense of other parts of the
listening experience isn't nearly as bad
as some other game hit gaming headsets
notably the razer kraken Forge which is
also $300 there is definitely some
looseness and Boo meanness to the bass
and some details in the mids are lost
even with the balanced EQ setting in
fact to the point where the mids were
kind of hard to evaluate there they're I
mean they're good enough that I can hear
everything clearly it's not like the
dialogue in a movie or a male vocalist
in a song is going to be completely
impossible to hear but they are obscured
somewhat by the lows highs on the other
hand are clear which is expected you got
to hear them footsteps if you're gonna
market something as a gaming headset so
the a 50s definitely don't disappoint
there I guess that's most of what I have
to say for for a list of subjective
listening tests but I feel like it's
important to mention that when we're
comparing $300.00 wireless gaming
headsets against what else you can buy
for $300 we have to be fair so I could
say yeah for $200 you could get wired
audiophile grade headphones that'll blow
the doors off of these are really the
other ones in this roundup as well but
it's because I don't really have any
experience with audiophile grade
wireless headphones I can't really speak
to whether they're a great value against
$300 audiophile wireless headphones so
all I can really do is compare these
three against each other
talk about it that way so first up for
double the price of a Corsair Vengeance
2100 you're getting more bass certainly
you are missing out on some of the
details in the mids but you are also
getting the included stand you are
getting varied configurable inputs and
you're getting console compatibility
which is sort of a big deal the 2100 is
PC only oh well Mac only as well but you
have to have a USB port that like you
know drivers and stuff you're also
getting more premium feeling materials
compared to the 2100 and you're getting
the handy dandy controls on the right
ear cup that let you change your EQ
profiles so there's three different
presets you can adjust the mix between
chat volume and game volume on the fly
just by pressing these buttons right
here that's a very nifty little feature
and but you are paying twice as much for
it compared to the SteelSeries age
Wireless which costs the same you are
getting much stronger like more sound in
that very low frequency range but other
than that they are quite feature
comparable and the H Wireless is do
sound are well rounded leave overall
better I mean for me personally that
trade-off of more Rumble is not worth it
but if you want your ears to tickle and
you want to feel it when an explosion
goes off then I guess these would be the
ones to do it for you
the last thing this is this is something
I'll let you guys kind of listen to for
a moment this is my microphone test with
the Astro a-50 wireless microphone I
hope you guys enjoyed it so that was my
microphone test I don't think I have to
tell you how good the microphone is on
the a 50 s I consider it to be a
courtesy thing to have a microphone that
is not offensive for your teammates to
listen to and this one really doesn't
qualify for me I mean data compression
in online chat applications will level
the playing field a little bit because
even a good source won't sound that
great but starting with a better source
does still help a lot and these are by
far the worst performing microphone in
the round I also don't really like boom
mic mics compared to retractable ones
the ideal position for a headset
microphone is in the corner of your
mouth and I find that but you know what
the boom mic it's like other you know
what do I do I bend it here first so
that I can try and get it in the right
spot I find them hard to adjust to get
in exactly the right spot so they end up
in front of your mouth a lot
the position lock see you can see it
actually locks into position and the
automatic mute that goes along with this
boom mic though is actually not not a
terrible implementation so I think
that's pretty much it for the astroid
50s like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment and let me know who you think is
going to be the big winner of this
roundup I think I've probably given a
fair number of hints already but
regardless let me know what you think
and as always guys don't forget to
