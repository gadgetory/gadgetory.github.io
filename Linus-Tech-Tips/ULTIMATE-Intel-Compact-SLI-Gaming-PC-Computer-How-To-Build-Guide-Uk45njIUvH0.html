the objective with our ultimate compact
gaming build guide was to build an
extremely powerful basically as good as
it gets gaming rig within the confines
of an extremely small chassis we wanted
to have the option to overclock this
beast we wanted to maintain acceptable
thermals and we wanted to have it not be
too loud this truly is a have-your-cake-
and-eat-it-too machine as usual we're
going to start with the rationale behind
each of the components why we chose that
particular part and some of the other
considerations that you may want to
think about if you're going to undergo a
similar project and then after that
we're going to show you guys the actual
process of building the machine with
nice close-ups of what we're doing so
you can follow along and then finally we
are going to show off the finished
machine including some performance
numbers which I think you are going to
find to be quite impressive before we
begin though I would like to take a
moment to thank our sponsor Thank You
Intel for making this build guide
possible we can't do these videos
without the support of great companies
like Intel they're the ones who are
actually providing us the budget to set
aside a week to plan shoot and edit this
video so there's there are some guys
over there
huge thanks again to Intel for making
this happen now when you cram a lot of
components into a very small enclosure
the biggest considerations are usually
the actual physical size constraints and
keeping thermals at acceptable and safe
levels for that reason part selection is
absolutely critical when the individual
components in your system run too hot
you are left with basically two
undesirable options so number one is you
can just leave them to their own devices
and their automatic fan control
algorithms especially graphics cards
will just ramp up fan speeds too
uncomfortable levels which I personally
find quite offensive although it might
not matter to you if you're a headphone
user so your mileage may vary on that
one and then option number two is that
the components will simply run too hot
which can cause reliability problems in
both the short and in the long term now
we're going to walk you through each of
the parts in the system one
by one to give you an idea of why we
chose it and to give you some tips and
pointers for how to choose your own
whether you are using a small case like
this or if you're just building a
regular non-compact gaming machine
because remember guys it's not always
all about size right right the Intel
Core i7 4770k with a be quiet shadow
rock - cooler was our weapon of choice
for this machine now particularly before
overclocking Intel's 4th gen Core series
processors offer unbeatable performance
per watt so that's the heat output which
is necessary for what we're trying to
achieve here now you could make the
argument that there's another 4th gen
processor the 46 70 K that would be very
very suitable for this build but we
opted for the 4770k with hyper-threading
just because we're kind of going for
ultimate here and while most games right
now are not going to benefit from the
additional threads that improvement in
the coding of games is definitely coming
and there are many gamers who also do
other things with their machines such as
video editing or other heavily threaded
workloads when it came to the memory we
actually didn't go full-on ultimate here
more RAM and higher memory speed each
deliver very limited performance
improvements in games so I mean right
now it looks like in battlefield 4
there's some benefit to faster memory
but that's a bit of an isolated case so
we decided to go with something pretty
standard we went with a 16 gig dual
channel kit of 21 33 megahertz memory
from a data we could have gone all out
like 2400 megahertz or 3,000 megahertz
or whatever else the case may be but the
reason we went with this option is that
when you go 21 33 you're actually not
paying much more than a 1600 megahertz
kit so really that's the reason why just
because it wasn't costing us more once
you go past that it starts to get more
expensive the reason we went with 16
gigs is because it gives us more than
enough for now with the option to
upgrade in the future without totally
overspending on the memory in comparison
to the rest of the system 16 gigs also
gives us a little bit of flexibility for
more memory intensive applications like
the video editing we mentioned before my
kuroh ETX performance motherboards often
actually deliver a pretty compelling
value compared to their ATX counterparts
even if you were to use them in a
full-size case and not an EM ATX case
but anyway we went with the g1 Sniper m5
from gigabyte because it's optimal PCI
Express slot spacing allows us to
actually install two dual slot graphics
cards running at PCIe 8x gen 3 which is
more than enough bandwidth even for
780ti s and have a left over PCIe 4x
slot for an additional add-in card of
our choice down the road whatever we
want to put in it that's not bad for em
ATX not to mention it comes with all the
latest bells and whistles including
swappable op amps for the onboard audio
was one swappable op-amp I killer
networking overclocking options galore
and all of that at under $200 the green
color scheme will also go very nicely
with our green graphics cards and green
LED lighting effects but of course I'm
not that shallow so the color had
nothing to do with it
it's all about the technical
technological superiority I like green
for the case we went with the BitFenix
phenom M it uses the same internals as
the prodigy M and while it doesn't have
the same like hardcore water cooling and
hard drive mounting options as the ITX
version does it still has room for a
large air cooling heat sink for the cpu
and the added expansion for PCI Express
cards is awesome it features 5 PCI slots
at the back for future expansion which
is a huge benefit if you ever wanted to
say for example add dual graphics cards
or something like that it's also small
enough to easily pack this sli rig
around with you to LAN parties or
wherever else you might need to take an
immensely powerful
well cooled little rig speaking of
cooling it can accept plenty of cooling
fans which we can run at low rpms when
we're idling for quiet operation then
ramp up as needed we'll be using Spector
pro green LED fans for this machine
Spector pros are one of the only really
good-looking fans out there that also
have performance and quiet operation on
their side so there are a couple of
other exceptions but for the most part
you got to choose performance
or looks well we chose both once again
guys storage is so personal but we're
going to go with something pretty
standard for this one which should be
applicable to many different people and
until 5:30 series 240 gig SSD will act
as our OS and key application slash
games drive while the Western Digital
four terabyte black will be our storage
powerhouse to handle a massive Steam
library a media collection and all that
kind of stuff and still provide
excellent performance but with huge
storage this SSD plus hard drive
configuration has grown in popularity
over the last couple of years a lot and
I think we're probably going to be
sticking with it for quite a while for
most high performance users I mean until
something paradigm-shifting happens with
respect to SSD pricing and capacity or
maybe some other new technology comes
along it makes a ton of sense to go with
fast small storage and then slower
massive storage so you get the best of
both worlds
well guys for us there was really only
one ultimate gaming graphics card
configuration we've gone with two gtx
780 Ti graphics cards from EVGA I really
don't know what to say about these other
than that they're the fastest gaming
cards on the market and they're thermal
and acoustic performance made them an
obvious choice over the red team this
time around for this specific bill
because of the constraints we have in
terms of space we went with rear exhaust
cards versus an open cooler like EVGA
ACX cooler because we felt we would
rather compromise GPU temperatures a
little bit we'll have the GPU running a
little bit hotter for the sake of
keeping the rest of the inside of the
case cooler remember that not every
component in your system can be read
with a temperature monitor so for things
like your power delivery components on
the motherboard lower ambient
temperatures inside the system can make
a big difference to long term
reliability so just because you have a
couple graphics cards in there and your
CPU temps look okay and your GPU temps
look okay that doesn't mean that an
open-air cooler is necessarily the best
choice for you so
rear exhaust for very small builds is
definitely recommended peripheral wise
for this rig honestly guys I'm not sure
how much sense it makes to keep
including these since everyone's choices
will be so different but tell you what
let me know if you'd like me to keep
featuring peripherals that I think makes
sense for each build and we'll see if we
keep doing it in the future anyway we
just got our hands on the ducky shine 3
so for our all-out machine we are
suggesting this all-out keyboard
unfortunately ours are blue backlight so
they won't match the rest of the green
theme here but don't worry there's a
green one available and it's available
in all the main Cherry MX key switch
types and in either a 104 key layout or
a 10 keyless layout so you can get
something to match your rig for sure for
our mouse we are going with the Death
Adder 2013 again it's green to match our
build which isn't the main factor here
because the main factor here is the fact
that it features one of the best sensors
on the market as well as excellent
ergonomics this is an extremely well
regarded mouse out there right now and I
have already recommended in previous
build guides but I have no problem
recommending it I gain finally for our
monitor it's kind of big got to go get
it we've gone with the Ben q XL 2420 te
if you saw my unboxing you'll already
know that for a 144 Hertz monitor it is
far and away the best-looking one we've
ever seen in terms of color and viewing
angle the one caveat is that it doesn't
support g-sync
so yeah until monitors that support G
sync start arriving I don't know that I
can recommend investing in a gaming
monitor right now but if I absolutely
had to then that would be the one which
leads us finally to our operating system
we went with Windows 8 because that's
all you can really get right now for
gaming maybe at some point here steamos
is going to be an option but that is
still very much in beta right now in
fact we have it running upstairs very
much in beta not ready yet windows 8 for
this particular machine when it comes to
pre build safety and setup base
secondly what you want is to start with
a safe static free workstation and
anti-static strap I like to keep mine on
my ankle to keep it out of the way you
also want to make sure there's no one
necessary clutter around so that you can
lose screws or trip on something and
knock something over because that would
be disastrous next up all we really need
for assembly these days is a multi-bit
screwdriver and the last thing is I
always recommend doing your first build
and powering it up outside the case to
ensure that everything works while it's
nice and easy to reach in case something
goes wrong and you have to take it back
to the store or send it back to the
manufacturer the motherboard box makes a
very handy non conductive test bench for
this outside the case installation will
start with CPU installation after
carefully removing the CPU from the
package align the little golden triangle
on the corner of the CPU with the
triangle on the plastic cover then what
you're going to do is lift the retention
arm by pushing away then up without
removing the plastic cover that protects
the delicate pins inside the socket
leave that in place for now then what
we're going to do is gently place the
CPU in the socket the risk of damage to
your system is highest at this point in
the build process so be extremely
careful if you're forcing it then there
is definitely a problem once the CPU is
in place pull down the retention cover
then pull down the retention arm lift it
out away a little bit and then lock it
under that little clamp right there once
you've done that there it goes the
plastic cover will pop itself right off
put that in the motherboard box for
safekeeping if you ever need to return
your motherboard they will require you
to send it in with this cover because
once again those pins inside that socket
are extremely fragile
ddr3 installation is simple pull back
the tabs on your motherboard align the
notches on your memory with the notches
inside the sockets then insert it gently
and finally press firmly down on the
memory on both sides until the latch
clicks back into place on its own then
you're done always install matched
memory sticks in the color matched slots
on modern motherboards
for dual-channel operation this gives
you better performance when it comes to
heatsink installation every one is a
little bit different and be quiet
mounting systems are not always my
favorite but they do have solidly built
products at good prices so that's why we
went for it in this particular case
because it's going to fit quite well
with the rest of our hardware but still
invest maximum cooling on the CPU so
don't be intimidated by all the little
tiny bits and screws and pieces right
here we're going to show you how exactly
it all goes together on the board so we
start with the backplate you position
the backplate so that the screws on the
back of the little backplate that's
already on the motherboard poke through
the much bigger backplate then you're
going to take each of these four longer
screws and put them through the board so
that we can access them on the top the
next step is to take the little plastic
washers and clip them from the top so
that they stay in place and don't fall
back through the board so now they're
going through the backplate and they are
stuck in place now that the backplate is
securely in place we can thread on the
nuts that will support the CPU hold down
use the included wrench to hold them in
place from the front of the ward while
tightening them from the back of the
board with a Phillips head screwdriver
now we're done with our board for a
little bit and it's time to work on the
heatsink itself simply use the four
countersunk screws to attach the hold
downs to the bottom of the heatsink
that's how we're actually going to well
hold it down onto the CPU now this next
step is optional but to maintain the
awesome looks of this system we are
going to swap out the stock fan which is
actually a very good fan with a Spectre
Pro just remove the metal clips on the
stock fan and then put them back onto
the new fan exactly the same way it's
actually quite quite simple and now it's
looking good
oh yeah next up put a line of thermal
compound which is included with your
heatsink onto the CPU and then position
the heatsink with a sensible fan
orientation so we're going for kind of a
pseudo push-pull configuration so once
the motherboard is in the case the rear
exhaust will
we help the Fen that we installed as a
push fan pull air through that massive
heatsink
also don't forget to orient the fan when
you're installing it so that the power
lead reaches to the CPU fan header
without any extra cable mess you know
lying around all over the place solid
cable management starts at every step
making sure that you're maintaining it
so you can you can actually plug that in
now we're ready for that I think at this
point you'll start to see why we went
with a low profile memory kit from a
data for this build tall memory modules
can interfere with large CPU heat sinks
in some cases yeah get it in cases they
can interfere because this is a computer
we're gonna put it in a case and all man
I crack myself up okay no but seriously
we're we actually aren't quite done with
this yet
we'll use that wrench again from the
front and then the screwdriver again
from the back but this time we are
tightening nuts onto the top of the
hold-down again this isn't my favorite
CPU mounting mechanism in the world but
the good news is that once they're all
on there it is extremely solid and it's
not going anywhere now my friends it is
time to start working on the case so we
are going to begin by taking off both
side panels by removing the four thumb
screws at the back what I really
recommend doing is taking these side
panels and putting them back into the
case box for now because we won't need
them until a bit later
the Phenom M is a little bit different
from most cases though and that we will
need it at some point during the
assembly process here because you can
see that the front i/o is actually
located on one of the side panels where
we have our power and reset buttons as
well as our front audio ports and our
USB 3 ports one little trick for this
case as well that we're going to
actually do is we're going to switch
sides and we're going to put the side
panel with the i/o on the left-hand side
of the case then we're going to take
this side paddle move it over to the
other side I found that when I was
working on this case recently that it
was a little bit easier to do cable
management that way and the only
drawback is that the logo on your power
and reset buttons will be upside down in
the finished product now that the case
is open undo the
twist-tie that's holding the accessory
box in place that box contains all the
screws you need to assemble your system
so please told who sit and for that
matter
don't lose that twist tie twist ties are
a handy-dandy reusable way of doing
cable management later on you can even
cut them to size according to what you
need if you have nice long ones like
this next you'll need to remove the
brace that's across the side panel just
take out the four countersunk screws and
pull that out and put it somewhere safe
make sure you also put those screws
somewhere safe I recommend the accessory
box that already contains all of your
other screws now it is time to replace
all the fans that came with your case if
you want to the ones that come with it
our decent but we're throwing inspector
Pro so yeah it'll be much more difficult
to try and do this later so make sure
you do fans pretty much first we'll
start at the bottom by removing the air
shield that comes on the case I don't
plan to reinstall this because we're
going to need that airflow space next
we'll remove the four screws that are
holding in the bottom fan take off the
stock fan and then we're going to reuse
those screws to replace it with our
Spectre Pro I also changed the
orientation to turn this one into an
intake to bring fresh air to both my cpu
heatsink and also up to my graphics
cards we then repeat that same procedure
for the rear fan replacing it this time
with a 140 millimeter Spectre Pro just
to get a little bit more airflow just a
reminder here guys make sure you're
checking your fan orientations as you're
installing each of them it's nice to
have logos the right side up in the
finished bill but it's even nicer to
have short easy to manage runs to the
fan headers on your motherboard once
everything is installed now we would
have liked to install more fans in the
top of this case to 120 millimeter fans
up there would have been absolutely
perfect for fresh air for those graphics
cards but unfortunately the fans don't
quite fit between the metal of our
chassis and the plastic outer layer and
when given the choice between a board
with tight spacing between the graphics
cards which would cause one of the cards
to be starved for air flow but it allow
top fans to be installed for even better
airflow to the other car
and then going with this board which
offers much better graphics card spacing
but doesn't allow for those top fans to
be installed on the other side I think
we that was a sacrifice we were willing
to make not to mention of course having
the graphics card spaced out like that
gives us a future expansion and the
ability to install another PCI Express
card here power supply installation
starts by taking out the thumb screw
that holds in the power supply bracket
here at the front of the case the holes
on this bracket do allow for the fan on
the power supply to face inward towards
the components or outwards towards the
front of the case where it can take an
air from these little vents on the side
at the front here but the design of the
case favors inward facing for my build
however I don't have much air intake
because I wasn't able to install those
top fan so in order to keep my intake
and exhaust as balanced as I can which
is optimal for cooling
I wanted to install the power supply
with the fan facing towards the front of
the case so it could pull in its own
fresh air then exhausted out the bottom
of the chassis without affecting the
pressure of the inside of the case the
air pressure so I had to do it a quick
double check to make sure that all of my
cables would reach with acceptable cable
management to the places that they
needed to go and then I was ready to
commit and screw the bracket into the
power supply in my chosen orientation
now I'd like to take this opportunity to
point out that the peer power 700 watt
power supply we're using is by no means
the only option for this build in fact
it's not even really that high-end for
something that's like an ultimate build
I was just trying to make a point that
modular power supplies like this Corsair
ax 860 I aren't always the best option
especially when you're planning to use
all of the connected cables anyway
because modular power supplies tend to
be larger to accommodate that modular
interface so as long as we can manage
the cables or use them all we're not
really getting any benefit out of the
modular interface the other point I was
trying to make is about the power
efficiency of the components we're using
this 700 watt power supply we'll handle
it I'll show you guys that at the end of
the video but with
all that said it's only an 80 plus
bronze power supply and all that so in a
x86 di or something similar would also
be a great choice for this particular
build I guess the other thing is whoops
excuse me we always use modular power
supplies so I'm shaking things up a
little bit anyway to finish up the power
supply installation we align the little
notches on the bracket slide the power
supply now connected to the bracket back
in put the thumb screw back in place and
then flip the case over so that we can
plug in the pass-through cable that
allows the power supply to be installed
in the front of the case it's a little
bit tricky it's a little bit of a tight
fit but we managed to get it in there
now is also a good time to flip that
power supply switch to the on position
if it has one to save yourself some
headache later when you finish the build
press the power button on the front of
the system and it doesn't turn on and
you're like oh what's wrong with it if
it's just the power button on the bottom
of the power supply but you didn't think
of it because it's on the bottom of this
case so before putting in the
motherboard there are a few things that
we're going to need from the motherboard
box grab your i/o shield your sli bridge
and your SATA cables we'll need the i/o
shield now but the other two you can put
aside for later
installing the i/o shield is a little
bit tricky in this case remember that
the motherboard is 180 degrees off the
normal upright orientation so your i/o
shield will go in upside-down compared
to normal make sure you get that right
at this stage next find the motherboard
standoffs in your box of K screws they
look a little something like this then
grab the little included tool that
adapts your Phillips head screwdriver to
a stand off socket there are four
standoffs already installed but you'll
need to use that little tool to install
four additional ones here here here and
here now guys you can see that our power
supply is actually already in from our
test fit but don't worry we're going to
show you the whole installation process
in just a moment in really small cases
like this it can be handy to pre connect
some of the cables to your motherboard
before actually lowering the motherboard
into the case particularly the eight pin
CPU connector is going to be hard to
reach with that large CPU heatsink
nearby so we pre connected the eight pin
and the 24-pin ATX connector it's
important here though to note that we
aren't able to fully install the power
supply until after the motherboard is
screwed in place due to space
constraints particularly with that large
heatsink screwing in the motherboard is
pretty easy but make sure guys that
you're using a long enough screwdriver
and I would highly recommend using a
magnetic one so just put the eight
screws into the eight different places
where they go and again please use a
magnetic screwdriver because otherwise
screws can fall into little nooks and
crannies in the case where they're
extremely difficult to retrieve a
magnetic screwdriver will not damage
your components the magnets are not
nearly strong enough we'll take this
chance now to put our power supply back
in but don't worry guys the details for
that are coming in in a second so just
sorry don't don't mind the power supply
don't mind the man behind the curtain
and now is also a good time to connect
our fans to the appropriate headers we
could plug them directly into the power
supply but I prefer using the onboard
connectors on the motherboard to enable
BIOS and software level fan control once
the system is up and running now
normally we do cable management as a
finishing touch but the way we're doing
this build forces us to do it now while
we can actually still get at anything
the first step is to figure out exactly
which connectors were going to need from
the power supply and jam all the extra
ones behind the power supply where it
can be completely out of sight and out
of the way of our airflow
we'll use some zip ties to keep them in
place because they're so tight that I
don't think twist ties will do the trick
in this case next we'll position the
side panel with the front connectors
next to the case on the left hand side
remember not the side it came on then
we'll pass all those cables through to
the front first we'll plug in the front
panel HD audio then the front USB three
these connectors are both keyed and or
missing pins so they'll only go in one
way just be gentle with them and then
finally the front power and reset
switches as well as the front power and
drive activity LEDs now BitFenix doesn't
color their positive wires which gives
it a very clean look but also makes it a
little bit difficult to figure out which
ones the positive wires so you will need
to match up the
I are indicated in your manual where it
needs the positive one with the tiny
little arrow on the corresponding front
header so guys look really carefully at
it and make sure you get these right in
fact at this stage even though there's
no graphics card in here you can do a
quick power on test and make sure that
the LEDs illuminate because if you get
this wrong now you'll be tearing out
your graphics cards if you need to fix
it in order to get at that little spot
speaking of graphics cards next we can
tuck our PCI Express cables out of the
way we will need those soon though when
we install the video cards so just a
twist I'll do the trick to to make sure
that you know they're just out of our
way so we can figure out what we're
doing and then the next bit is just one
way of doing this okay so if we were
using the included cross brace with the
case we could simply install our three
and a half inch drive and our two two
half inch SSD on here throw that into
the case and that would work just fine
that's the way it's intended to be used
we came up with a bit of a different
idea though I wanted a cleaner look to
the internals so I had to grab a couple
of longer SATA cables and I'm going to
be running them down to the bottom of
the case where I'll be kind of ghetto
mounting the SSD on top of the hard
drive I'll show you all that in a minute
but it's up to you which way you want to
do it one other thing I like about this
approach with not having the cross brace
in there is that it gives me the option
to add a side panel window as like a DIY
mod later on in the future so it's
totally up to you anyway I grab those
SATA cables plug them into the
motherboard one little trick that I use
is because I can never remember four
stacked SATA cables four stacked right
angle static cable connectors which one
is 0 and which one's one like which is
the first port is I'll usually plug them
into completely different stacks so that
it's easy to figure out which one is the
first one in the boot order by default
in the BIOS and I'll plug my SSD into
that one so that if I ever reset my BIOS
I don't have to remember to go and
manually reset my SSD as the boot device
it's just a nice little building trick
for you anyway once that's done you've
got pretty much everything plugged into
the board and it's time to tuck
everything nicely behind that left side
panel and close it up
don't force
if it's not closing check what it's
stuck on readjust and try again
clean cable management is not worth
damaging something so just take your
time and go slow once you do get great
cable management going on though it's
very satisfying and having the PCI
Express slot area nice and tidy is great
for airflow for your graphics cards and
will help them run cooler and lasts
longer
alright so here it is guys the not
really recommended way that I'm
installing my drives into the machine I
am going to put both of them rather than
here right down there under the CPU
heatsink there's lots of air flow from
the fans around there but obviously
there is a problem there aren't enough
mounting points for two drives more on
that later anyway first we're going to
mount our hard drive these rubber
grommets and screws will do nicely for
that so just put the grommets in from
the bottom of the case then position the
drive in place with the SATA connectors
towards the side panel then screw it in
from the bottom alright so there wasn't
really any trouble there well no this is
where the magic starts guys I'm going to
put my SSD right here on top of the hard
drive how you might ask well with a very
famous Canadian invention velcro just
put this stuff on the back of the SSD
stick it to the top of the hard drive
and you are ready to rock next install
the SATA power cables and SATA data
cables onto both drives and then run
them along the bottom of the case for
better cable management now that we've
done so much work to prepare ourselves
for GPU installation it's actually
pretty straightforward all we do is turn
the case around and we find oh this has
a toolless PCI slot mounting mechanism
so just undo the screw there lift it up
you're going to have to remove the PCI
slot covers that are already in there
because they're in the way for us to
install our graphics cards then grab one
graphics card I'd probably recommend
doing the top one first and then
carefully maneuver it into the case what
you'll probably have to do is put it
kind of butt end in first into the five
and a quarter inch bay that of course we
can't use because our system is so full
of other gear in spite
the fact that it's in there and in spite
of the fact that the front of the case
actually doesn't even have a spot for it
you know that's the that's the feet on
them for you anyway
so you go ahead and put that in and then
press it down firmly then follow up with
the second card pressing it down firmly
then go around to the back put that last
PCI cover in unless you have another
expansion card such as a sound card or
raid card or you know I don't know like
red rocket card or whatever you want to
do with this awesome little machine that
is aside from putting in additional slot
covers put the screw back in place and
then just plug those bad boys in since
you put the PCI Express power cables
exactly where you were going to need
them earlier on in the build they're
right there so one eight pin and one six
pin connector for each of the graphics
cards and we are pretty much done here
folks okay well we're not quite done
we're finished the hardware which brings
us to software number one is in a system
with two drives I've seen Windows do
this stupid thing enough times so I
recommend physically unplugging the
drive you don't want any of your windows
files on so go ahead and unplug the hard
drive from time to time it stores the
boot manager on onedrive and then the
actual OS on the other drive so the
system can't boot without both of them
in which is ridiculous so that's just
one little tip for you guys then when we
get into the BIOS there's a couple
little configuration tips that are just
even just basic stuff like not
overclocking or anything like that so
just make sure that HCI mode is enabled
for all of your SATA ports and ensure
that all of the components are detected
correctly your memory is running at the
correct speed and all of that good stuff
next up Windows installation is a snap
if you know how don't worry about the
lack of a disk drive in this machine you
can just grab all the files off of a
disk copy them to a blank USB Drive and
boot from that it's faster and more
convenient in fact most of the techies I
know just have a dedicated USB Drive for
doing OS installations just like that
drivers are the next thing and there's
something that many people struggle with
but it's not too overwhelming if you
break it down even devices that already
have drivers installed so Windows Update
will grab drivers automatically for a
lot of this stuff
would recommend grabbing the latest ones
directly from the manufacturer website
so you can start with gigabyte they make
your motherboard so they should have the
latest Intel chipset drivers LAN or
network drivers and sound drivers but
then when you're finished with that you
can just do a double check and you know
head over to Intel site big foots a real
tech site or whoever else manufacture
the actual chips on the board itself but
as a catch-all the gigabyte website
should be fine and then you'll also need
to go to an videos website to get the
latest drivers for your graphics cards
you can pick up GeForce experience and
it'll continue to keep them up to date
on its own now if there's something that
you're having trouble finding a driver
for here's a little trick that I use go
to the device manager right click the
component in question then just go to
details and use the drop down box to go
to hardware ID then Google the venn
underscore number number number and
device underscore number number number
string and it will usually tell you
exactly what that device is so then you
can google that and you can find a
driver for it so now it's conclusion
time guys I'd like to talk about a
couple things so one is some performance
numbers and some temperature numbers for
our system small systems no longer need
to perform any differently from big
systems this right here has a core i7
4770k perfectly capable of overclocking
it also has two DTX 780ti s it will
perform as well as a much larger system
that has that same hardware and in terms
of temperatures honestly considering the
size of this little beast I think you
guys will be pranked quite impressed by
the numbers that we're showing you right
now this is under a gaming load so a
real-world load scenario so let's talk
about an overall trend as well aside
from this is a great performing
reasonably quiet actually that kind of
impressed me I'm quite impressed by that
you want to go into the BIOS and
configure fan control if you want to
make it this quiet but you know even
running at full speed I think it
probably won't bother most people anyway
very very quiet so aside from the
performance and the quiet and the
compactness let's talk about the trend
towards Portability and smaller size in
the industry in general I think
the Mac Pro is a very interesting
comparison here now this isn't as
powerful as a Mac Pro particularly one
with a 12 core CPU in it I mean the Mac
Pro is more workstation oriented it
supports quad-channel memory it's got
dual workstation grade graphics cards in
it as opposed to consumer grade graphics
cards although we could put workstation
grade graphics cards in here but it's
also very very very small on the other
hand this system is a little bit bigger
it's a very heavy hitter for its
intended use which is heavy gaming and
light video editing or other content
creation and in my mind it's much more
flexible it's much more upgradable
especially right now this is this is
another trend that may or may not take
off but Apple's certainly banking on it
less internal expansion and more
external expansion I talked a lot while
we were doing this build guide about why
I liked this particular board for its
ability to allow us to expand and put
dual graphics cards in it and then even
expand further and add an additional PCI
Express slot in it Apple has not given
the option at all to expand either via
PCI Express or even the internal drives
of the device you can just get a bigger
single PCI Express SSD and that's pretty
much all you can do they want you to use
Thunderbolt an external expansion option
in order to get things like high
throughput storage professional grade
expansion cards like capture cards or
Red Rocket cards or other devices and
they want you to do all that outside the
case so you can actually get like
Thunderbolt 2 PCI Express and closures
and things like that and I just have to
wonder a little bit if this isn't a
better middle ground because we're
getting that compact missile though it's
small enough to sit next to your monitor
without being so small that it's you
know really really tiny and impressively
small but we actually get some external
expansion I got a wonder if the person
who wants a tiny little Mac Pro wants an
octopus of Thunderbolt cables coming out
of it connected to their monitor and
then you know external storage box 1 &amp;amp; 2
&amp;amp; 3 &amp;amp; 4
as they end up needing more things I
mean we could still put a couple more
drives in this thing without even
resorting to anything external
whatsoever just by putting this bracket
back into the machine so there you go
guys this to me is a fantastic option
it's a PC of course you could probably
find a way to hackintosh it if you
really wanted to run OS 10 and I'll be
interested to see where we go from here
now we focused a lot throughout this
build guide as well on the high end
potential this system how its 4770k and
like dual 780ti s and it ended up being
very expensive but I want to also talk
about some recommended ways to scale
back and get better bang for the buck
out of it by going with a 46 70 K a
single GTX 770 or 780 and a smaller SSD
and hard drive you could actually build
a system quite like this but push the
price point down to the point where it
really doesn't cost any more than a
regular desktop machine and still offers
great expandability for the future so
maybe it's not the kind of thing where
you're going to chuck your current PC in
the garbage and go buy one of these but
next time you're shopping for PC whether
you move it around a lot and attend land
events or you don't it just sits in one
place you may want to consider a small
machine do you need all that expansion
or is this the interesting middle ground
between something like the Mac Pro and
something like a full-fledged ATX
desktop tower anyway guys until next
time thank you for watching this altima
compact gaming system build guide like
the video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it and leave us a comment
if you have any feedback on our build
guides or special requests for the next
one because there will be more of these
yeah
you
