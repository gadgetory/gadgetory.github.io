2013 is powered by Western Digital our
trusted gaming gear partner is corsair
vengeance and our trusted retail partner
is NCIX calm now if you've been
following lately you'll know that
there's a couple of acer devices that i
am personally pretty enamored with one
is the w7 which is a phenomenally well
built Windows tablet and the other is
the Aspire s7 which is actually the
notebook being carried around by yours
truly here at the show but this is an
all new device this is the w3 which is a
full Windows 8 tablet in an 8-inch form
factor this is the first time we've seen
this so it's got sort of the expects
there are the specs that you'd expect so
it's got the new Intel Atom processor
it's got two gigs of RAM it's available
in 32 gig or 64 gig configurations but
there are a couple things that are
unique about it so you've got microSD
expansion which is nice to have but I'm
going to have our lovely assistant Peter
here show me how you actually transport
this around with you so it comes with
the keyboard dock or doesn't yet go
ahead it comes with the keyboard doctor
it doesn't depending on the region but
it clips in on the speaker ports down at
the bottom stays in place now you can
chuck it in your bag and you're ready to
take it with you on the go but Linus why
would I ever take a tablet out of my
house I never use my tablet outside of
my house personally I don't use my
tablet outside of my house well there's
a good answer it comes pre-loaded with
microsoft office in spite of the fact
that this is not a Windows RT devices is
a full-blown windows 8 device meaning
you can run your modern UI experience oh
thank you you can run a modern UI
experience you can run a don't worry
we'll get this modern UI regular desktop
experience whatever it is you happen to
want you can run all of your legacy
applications but it comes pre-loaded
with office meaning you can actually get
something done on it when you're on the
go
as how things always happen at these
things guys these are pre production
units these aren't going to be available
till sometime around end of June so this
one right here yes the button there does
load up the modern UI so you've got that
same interface that you're going to be
familiar with already and then there's
the desktop including the don't see if I
can figure out how to use this thank you
Peter hopefully we're going to find
whatever you saw microsoft office on the
other one so let's move on to the next
cool thing that ace are showing off in
their booth now this is a pretty unique
design if you check out the coverage we
did from the intel booth on NCIX tech
tips we showed a lot of different hinge
designs for two and one type devices
tablet notebook we don't know what it is
this it doesn't quite fit cleanly into
that category because it's a little bit
unique this is the Aspire r7 from Acer
and I might have to get a lovely
assistant to come in here and help me
move it around because I've got only one
hand but it can basically be used in
what would be a traditional notebook
mode so there you go it's open all the
way you may have noticed or you may not
have noticed that the touchpad is in a
bit of a different position on this
thing so it's intended for you to be
using it either as a touch put
traditional notebook mode just like that
or and I have complained about this so
many times what is the problem with
touchscreen the problem is that it is
fatiguing to sit like this with your arm
like this it's too far away show me what
it does this is why the touchpad gets
covered up it is intended to be used in
what they're calling ezel mode this
allows you to easily hahaha oh wow this
allows you to easily use the keyboard
for typing and the touch screen for
interacting with the device like this is
touch perfect for everyone the answer's
no touch is not for everyone and if
touch isn't for you you don't have to
use it a lot of the time I would
probably end up having a mouse hooked up
to this but I'm the kind of person who
actually carries a gaming mouse around
in his backpack so not everyone is
necessarily me if it was like my kid
using it then it's going to be like
Angry Birds or whatever okay well
there's some kind of a bird let's go
look at that one sort of complete
there's a bird okay so angry birds or
something like that well that's what
they're going to want to do and this is
going to be a perfect mode for that now
with that said it's not like you lose
the productivity as well personally I
think
me a while to get used to a touchpad on
the top of check this out if I'm working
on something I want to show it to
someone this I can probably do on my own
you flip it around you can see in the
mirror right here it auto rotates which
means you can easily show someone
something this could be great for
creative professionals and just for
content consumption you don't have to
use it as a notebook at all it can be
used in tablet mode it is a little bit
on the heavy side guys let's be
realistic it's a notebook it's not a
tablet it's a full-fledged notebook
device you got your USB 3 you got your
SD card you got everything that you
could want on a notebook it's also got
an IPS panel and I've pretty much run
out of steam for what to say about this
other than yeah that looks pretty cool
very different from anything else that
we've seen so far now we're almost at
the part that I'm really excited about
that I'd been geeking out about but I
guess I'll do this one first because
it's pretty cool as well this is the
aspire s3 which is very similar to the
notebook that I use except that it has
been made a little bit more accessible
in terms of pricing so what have they
changed versus the s7 number one is the
keyboard is black ok not that big of a
difference number two is the keyboard
lacks the eol illumination that
automatically reacts to the lighting in
the room ok so if you really need an
illuminated keyboard you're going to
want to get an s7 number two is it only
has a glass surface on the multi-touch
touch screen on the back of the notebook
is now a plastic surface so that's not
going to be quite a scuff resistant but
it's certainly going to have some
scratch and scuff resistance even though
it's not quite to the same degree as
glass would it's a little bit thicker
but you actually get something in return
for increasing that thickness you're
actually able to add check this out a
dedicated graphics card to it so this
particular model comes with a GT 7 35 m
which compared to the onboard graphics
that are available in most of these than
in light notebooks is definitely going
to be an improvement it also uses up to
a one terabyte sshd meaning you're going
to have quick resumes from sleep I've
gone ahead and put it to sleep right
here so we're going to go ahead and wake
it up check this out especially compared
to traditional hard drives that do not
have an SSD component built into them
although psst models may also be
available
and this is the one that I'm actually
excited about this is the Aspire s7 392
if you guys have ever watched one of my
livestreams or you've ever heard me talk
about my favorite notebook you'll
already know I have one of these but
this is the older generation and I had
three complaints about my notebook three
each of which has been addressed with
the new generation product complaint
number one the battery life is not good
enough I have to carry around this
external battery in order to keep it
acceptable to the point where I can
really get the six-hour six and a half
hours of battery life that I need out of
it thirty percent better battery life in
the new device very nice complaint
number two the keyboard is extremely low
profile too low profile it's not very
comfortable to type on it doesn't bother
me as much as it bugs slick but BAM
higher travel distance Keys on the new
keyboard in spite of the fact that the
new s7 is one millimeter thinner than
the old s7 last but not least the
touchpad on mine has a bit of a latency
issue it legs and it's a little bit too
twitchy sometimes when I'm trying to use
it and and click with the with the
buttons down here new s7 no more leg all
gone it is now officially like I
actually couldn't improve anything about
it at this point so that's a shame
because you guys are going to have a
REIT it's going to be a real trick to
make something better than this in my
eyes now so guys don't miss any of our
