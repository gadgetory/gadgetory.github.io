introduced the Corsair concepts late
with an air-cooled ode to mid build that
was pretty neat but apparently left some
of you wanting more well your blue balls
can rejoice because the Blue Monster is
complete and we're gonna walk you
through the process of building in the
dual system case that Corsair introduced
as a crazy concept but looks like it is
actually coming to market but first I
got to tell you what's not a crazy
concept Mac Weldon Mac Weldon makes
great underwear t-shirts socks wallets
and more they believe in simple shopping
and if you use code tech tips they'll
get 20% off at the link below
the first step was to remove the
previous air-cooled build that was done
for comparison's sake starting with the
one Quadro that was left in it after the
system got raided for our triple
projector gaming setup then finishing
with both motherboards with their
air-cooled Hardware still attached to
them next began the tedious process of
installing GT X 1080 short top blocks
onto all of the quad rows these coolers
have shorter acrylic covers for improved
compatibility with cards like the p5
thousands that we're using and then a
single standard full cover water block
for the GTX 10 atti
the plan here is to use that last card
for a dedicated compact gaming system
while the quad Rose power a
top-of-the-line workstation now as much
as we'd have loved to film the entire
process here in real time I don't think
even our petabyte project server could
stomach that much 8k red footage and
neither could I so time-lapse it is
oh man that's looking good I don't know
if I could ever get sick of gorgeous C&amp;amp;C
work like that
hmm the two CPU blocks were a little bit
easier to install sort of our mini ITX
Trixie 270 motherboard gets a standard
ek supremacy Evo so that one was all
good but getting the rampage six
extremes monoblock on is a bit of a
weird process that involves punching
through the plastic blockages in the
mounting holes on the motherboard
replacing the vrm heatsink with
something reminiscent of an n dot two
cooler and then finally hand tightening
the thumb screws on the back after
popping both boards back into the slate
followed by the four Quadros we arrived
at terminal time the last build that we
used one of these four was actually with
a custom one designed for seven cards in
seven gamers one CPU so then I mean by
comparison quad GPUs is a pretty normal
configuration so this four-way terminal
is again by comparison and off-the-shelf
item and a perfect way to plumb up a
whole nother board full of GPU
just be really careful with the o-rings
don't tear them and make sure that all
eight are properly seated because they
leak right in your GPU stack is very
likely to end up killing something to
cool our dual system build ek graciously
provided two quad 120 millimeter XE
series radiators for the workstation
portion and then an additional triple
140 thick radiator for the gaming system
so that's right folks we're gonna be
running two independent loops which will
allow our systems to function without
the need to power on both of them at a
time mounting the rads was impressively
easy thanks to the fancy sliding mount
system that course are built into the
slate but we're actually a little torn
on our choice of light loops for the 13
fan slots that we're filling for the
imposing but classy aesthetic that we
ended up going for we think it may have
actually been a bit better to go pure
performance with their maglevs instead
the rest of the planning bending cutting
tinkering small modifications and cable
management or lack thereof took about
two days on and off resulting in a super
clean aesthetic accomplished in part by
our signature hard in the front soft in
the back style you might think it's kind
of dumb but it actually saves a
significant amount of time both during
the initial build and more importantly
whenever you need to crack the loop open
for maintenance then it was time to fill
up the loops via the installed d5 pump
and reservoir combo units starting with
the workstation build this way we could
make sure that no leaks sprouted in any
spots that our ITX systems GPU would
hide and no leaks surprisingly with
thankfully the same story again for our
ITX build which is really good because
it would have super sucked to empty both
loops and fix a leak down there with
both of them mostly full we poured in
some coolant concentrates from primo
chill first an opaque white for the
workstation then
a light blue to match our cables for the
gaming build but before we get to the
glam montage nope not quite time yet I
want to run you guys through our cooling
results for the workstation temps went
down from just over 70 degrees average
on our 79 XC 18 core Extreme Edition to
61 degrees a pretty decent improvement
even if I think we could do better with
the living and then as for our GPUs
those dropped almost 30 degrees from an
average of 82 down to 50 3.5 at full CPU
and GPU load an eye to 64 and this is
with all of our fans running at their
minimum speed so this thing is super
quiet as for our ITX system well we saw
big improvements there and not just to
temperatures also performance with so
many cards installed in our workstation
our little mini ITX air cooled system
was limited to a suffocated low profile
noctua l 9i which caused our 7700 k to
hit a hundred degrees and throttle 30 to
50% at stock speeds our water cooled rig
predictably turbos the CPU up
comfortably and maxes out the GPU at 54
degrees after a prolonged stress test
now with that out of the way here's one
of our famous gland montages set to
music
okay so that was fun but um back to
reality for a minute
why why would anyone need a case like
this well we came up with a couple
things let's say that you do 3d design
work in programs that can take advantage
of multiple graphics cards like blender
or 3ds max with a system like this you
could dramatically speed up your render
times and still game or do other work
while the main system is chewing away at
a large job or how about streaming many
streamers use two systems so that they
can keep encoding to one of them to
avoid impacting the primary rigs gaming
performance with all that said though
since literally none of the internal
components get reused in a configuration
like this one and the slate is slated to
cost as much as two separate high-end
cases there are some pretty strong
arguments to be made for just having two
normal systems like stacked on top of
each other so once again we're turning
to you guys in the comments what would
you use a concept slate for let us know
and while you're at it let us know if
you've ever heard of iFixit I'm sure you
have if you watch our Channel

where to buy the wait is that the one I
just said right our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join see I was holding up both hands as
I went through because it's got two
systems see it's subtle you know that's
