gaming PC look no further than the
obsidian series 250 d from Corsair click
now to learn more I knew this video was
going to be a challenge I knew that
having come from the thousand dollar +
LG 34 um 95 I was gonna have a hard time
being quite as positive about its little
brother the 29 um 65 a monitor that
currently retails for about a third of
the price and one that has a form factor
that I just never really found very
compelling but first an overview the 29
um 65 is an ultra wide 21 by 929 inch
monitor from LG that runs a resolution
that LG calls ultra wide Full HD but I
think it's actually faster to say 2560
by 1080 it features a thin bezel a
couple of functional if unexcited
speakers a joystick control knob for
navigating the on-screen display and the
glossy plastic stand that unfortunately
has only two height positions that you
need a screwdriver to adjust neither of
which I really found high enough but you
can just kind of put it on a box like
what I did if you really want to under
it's very satisfactory hard anti-glare
coating is an 8 bit IPS panel for solid
color performance and superior wide
viewing angle performance something
that's a must
since just looking at the thing straight
on you're gonna be looking at the edges
from a bit of an angle the monitor
features a fairly average 5 millisecond
great a great response time rating that
despite being the same as the um 95
which we looked at recently feels very
noticeably snappier which would indicate
that this monitor is gonna have low
input lag and be a gamers delight I've
got an input lag tester on order from
Leo Bodnar but it's not here yet so in
the meantime I decided to do a
side-by-side comparison against the PB
278 Q from isus I monitor with that
fairly average input lag we shot at 240
frames per second and that looks like my
subjective observations were correct
with each frame equivalent to about 4
milliseconds the difference you're
seeing here is between 16 to 20
milliseconds or equivalent to the action
reaching your eyes a full frame sooner
than the PB a very solid result motion
blur is also subjectively a strong point
that being about as good as I could
expect for an IPS panel feature wise
it's got inputs galore with dual link
DVI to HDMI inputs DisplayPort and an
audio in that can either run the two
on-board speakers or pass-through to the
headphone out jack these inputs support
a side-by-side mode that would let you
run two devices at the same time like
like a desktop and a notebook as if
you've got two five by four monitors a
feature I don't personally find that
useful but I'm sure for someone that
will be a huge deal a more practical use
of the extra horizontal space for me is
enabled by LG's screen split utility
it's available Windows and Mac and
allows you to split your windows or your
screen up a number of different ways it
actually works a lot better than I
expected but the execution needs maybe
two to three more software revisions and
some more customization options before
I'd say it's ready to take on the likes
of display fusion for example I found
the most useful modes for me were the
three screen left and three screen
balanced for screen was just too small
to be useful with a mere 1280 by 540
resolution per window and two screen
split can be replaced easily by just
using Aero snap within windows on the
subject of resolution though let's get
into why I never really cared for
29-inch 21 by 9 ultra wide monitors a
form factor that some others notably
Austin Evans and in his gaming setup
video where he talks about how great it
is for widescreen movies and games
really like I guess a big part of it is
that it's really not as big as it sounds
the further you get from a 1 to 1 square
aspect ratio the smaller the screen area
is relative to the diagonal monitor size
this 29 inch monitors actually smaller
than a 27-inch 16 by 9 and only about 12
percent bigger than a 24 inch 16 by 10 a
size and aspect ratio that I always
really liked with that said I am aware
of the advantages movies that are shot
in 2.3 9x1 cinematic aspect ratio can be
watched without black bars and the
advantage for gaming with a wider field
of view without bezels getting in the
way is obvious and in fact gaming is one
of the strongest arguments I can make
for getting this monitor it's only about
33% more difficult to drive than a
single tenon
you monitor so you won't be spending a
fortune on your graphics card and it
delivers a very different gaming
experience in supported games which of
course brings up the usual issues that
crop up every time we throw a new
resolution at the gaming industry and
that's that many games will not run at
2560 by 1080 without a little bit of
tinkering the first bit of good news
though is that if you need some help
figuring out if your games will work at
all or getting your games running check
out widescreen gaming form they've
helped me out a couple of times in the
past and the next bit of good news is
that because the vertical resolution is
1080 in games that just flat-out won't
run an ultra wide you can play at 1920
by 1080 with black bars along the sides
without any weird interpolation or other
visual anomalies your monitor will be
equivalent to about a 23 inch 1080p
monitor when it's run this way gaming
aside the windows modern UI and steam
big picture are a couple of newer UI
styles that can benefit in a big way
from more horizontal space although
valve has yet to add support for 21 by 9
resolutions and I'm also acutely aware
of the productivity argument that it's
basically equivalent to two 17-inch 5 by
4 monitors with a 1280 by 1080
resolution each making it great for
multitasking it's just that I didn't
find that productivity was
earth-shatteringly different enough to
justify the price premium the way that I
did on the larger um 95 I never found
1080 vertical pixels to be enough and
giving me the option to either stretch
things out even wider or narrow them
even further so I feel like it's 2007
again and I'm working on a couple of
17-inch LCDs are a couple of options
that I just don't find that appealing
for just over three hundred and fifty
dollars or so I can get to 23 inch 1080p
monitors if productivity is a focus for
me but that's all subjective and I know
a lot of people disagree with me so with
that out of the way let's get down to
the bottom line since the price of the
34 um 95 with its higher resolution
higher pixel density and larger size
makes it completely out of reach for
gamers and pretty much everyone else for
now now that I've actually used one of
these instead of just seeing them
briefly at trade shows would I recommend
a 29 inch 21 by 9 monitor
as a less expensive substitute for
productivity the answer is no but for
gaming or a mixture of the two actually
yes I would some people don't mind
bezels and some people think that the 48
by 9 aspect ratio of an eyefinity setup
is just dandy I am NOT one of either of
those types of people and even though I
could get 323 inch 1080p monitors for
the price of one of these which would be
better for productivity I prefer the
single monitor experience for gaming and
the comparatively smaller amount of
hassle that comes from dealing with one
monitor running a weird resolution
versus three spanned monitors running a
weird resolution thank you for watching
