to find the coolest gaming desktops here
at the show that are powered by Intel
processors and I think you are going to
be impressed with the variety that we
found journeying through all the sweets
and show floor and all of that great
stuff come along for the ride so we're
going to start our tour of what I think
are the coolest desktops here at CES
2015 with the asus rog gr8 and come on
you guys totally did that on purpose I'm
getting the wink from JJ over there this
is the great it features up to a core i7
45-10 you processor so not exactly your
most powerful CPU ever but look at this
form factor this is a two and a half
liter PC and it contains a lot of
technology that you might expect as well
as some that you wouldn't it supports up
to 16 gigs of ddr3 memory it's got a gtx
750ti graphics card with two gigs of
gddr5 ram although it should be noted
that graphics card is somewhere between
a mobile 750 ti and a desktop 750 ti
still a capable 1080p gaming box it
features a built-in two and a half inch
SSD or hard drive and then it has an
expansion bay for an SSD or hard drive
upgrade and I'm told that we will
potentially be looking at raid support
for that with the UEFI update in the
future and it's got you know Gigabit LAN
AC wireless all that kind of cool stuff
but here's what you might not expect
unlike most desktop pcs this one was
actually designed by the ROG motherboard
team so you're going to find technology
that normally you'd only see in
something like a republic of gamers
impact mini ITX motherboard like their
supreme effects audio with their
on-screen visual indicator for where
things are coming from their premium
audio capacitors the actual dedicated
portion of the PCB inside that is set
aside for audio in fact it's even easily
upgradeable so I don't I think the side
nope there we go side panels unlocked
i'm going to try not to break it here
but check this out it even features easy
upgrading a very unusual thing for a
compact pc like this access to the extra
hard drive bay as well as the ram slot
they're pretty freaking cool stuff and
small continuing our quest for awesome
gaming desktops here at CES 25
we actually found one of them in a
fairly unexpected place this is not
necessarily something you can actually
buy unfortunately because it is a fully
customized case made by Richard souris
also known as Darth Beavis but this
thing features some pretty cool Intel
gaming technology so we figured ah
whatever it got accounts it's got a dual
to 120 millimeter liquid-cooled core i7
59 60 x it's got a GTX Titan z 32 gigs
of ddr4 memory three more 120 millimeter
fans in the bottom here and this thing
was made completely from the ground up
just to be freaking amazing as part of
cooler master's case mod world series so
this is just one of those things it's
got dual one terabyte SSDs it's more of
a we just kind of had to show it to you
than anything else so behind me I've got
the main gear shift this is pretty much
what you would get if you approached a
boutique system builder and told them
yeah I want you to just build the most
like wicked bad as gaming machine ever
and this is what would show up on your
doorstep it's got an intel core i7 59 60
X cpu that's an eight-core 16 Fred chip
it's got 32 gigs of ddr4 memory dual GTX
980 graphics cards it's in this wicked
custom case with a beautiful paint job
on it the CPU is liquid cooled with a
corsair solution that actually main gear
has modified with their own branding on
there and in terms of storage I actually
don't know exactly what's in there but
it looks like a whack ton of SSDs
absolutely beautiful machine and based
on how well its handling shadow of
mordor up there in 4k I think it's got
the horses to back up what it looks like
it can do now you guys have been asking
me for a review of this next one here
for quite some time this is the
alienware alpha it's kind of like a it's
a PC it's a console it's like a little
tiny gaming machine okay it's definitely
that last one I don't know about either
the first two because it lives somewhere
in between it's got a core i3 core i5 or
core i7 processor a custom Maxwell based
GPU it holds up to eight gigs of memory
you can throw a hard drive in there
actually the memory of the CPU and the
driver all upgradeable features AC
wireless it comes with an
included Xbox 360 controller and the
whole concept behind this even though
alienware was initially showing it off
with steamos is well we want people to
have that couch experience regardless of
what they're doing so it comes with a
custom UI that sits over top of Windows
8.1 and allows you to change your system
configuration launch team big picture
and basically use it without ever
touching a keyboard and mouse which
isn't to say that you can't still use a
keyboard and mouse on it should you so
desire is it the most powerful machine
in the world well no the answer is no
but it also comes with only a 130 watt
power brick and a form factor that is
freaking impressive considering that for
many modern games you'll be able to run
them at decent settings at 1080p on this
little tiny device our last top desktops
of CES 2015 was actually one we had a
little bit of a hard time categorizing
we knew we wanted to include it in one
of our top roundups but we weren't sure
if because it has a mobile core i7
quad-core processor it fell under the
mobile or if it because it's a desktop
because it sits on a desk it fell on
your desktop but we knew we had to talk
about this thing so we picked one we put
it in there this is the AG 244 k edition
and of course an all-in-one starts with
the screen it's a 4k display 10-point
multi-touch MSI says this is exclusive
to them but it's got DC backlight
control with up to 75 percent less blue
light so this is a technology we're
starting to see in monitors but not
something that is typical in an
all-in-one it's also extremely slim at
only 21 millimeters it features an
optical drive it's got your full
complement of i/o in fact it actually
doesn't look much thicker than a monitor
but where things start to get really
impressive is unlike your typical
all-in-one this features gaming grade
graphics they can't tell us exactly what
GPUs in it yet it's going to be future
900 series GPU but not slouchy graphics
so you should be able to play mainstream
titles like League of Legends on this
computer in 4k it's also got a bunch of
their other gaming technology hence the
you know G sort of gaming series red and
black colour scheme on it so it features
their super raid 2 which is up to 3 SSDs
and raid 0 it features their killer
networking which whether you prefer
outer until networking is up to you but
hey for better for worse it is in there
and there's a couple more cool things as
well so it comes with a color-changing
keyboard as well as a mouse I mean are
they the best thing ever no but at least
they'll get you going and last but not
least it supports hdmi input so if you
had something like a game console next
to your PC if you're a super
space-saving kind of person you can go
ahead go HDMI and you don't even have to
have the computer powered on and you can
use it just as a 4k display pretty darn
cool thanks for watching guys I hope you
enjoyed our top intel-powered gaming
desktops here at CES 2015 as always guys
like the video if you liked it dislike
it if you thought it sucked leave a
comment letting me know which one you
thought was best and as always don't
forget to subscribe if you haven't
