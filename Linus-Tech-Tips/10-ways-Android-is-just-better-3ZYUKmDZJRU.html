welcome back to coping with your iPhone
James how do you deal with all the
useless seldom used or bloatware apps
that clutter up your homescreen mm-hmm
great question well you know it's really
no problem all I do is I put them all
into one folder that I call you sis
garbage and then I just never go in
there again and it only takes up one
square on my home screen one square
that's great and and how about you Riley
well that's a great method but what I do
is I put all my useless apps on their
own special page in the back and I just
never swipe it just doesn't ever go
there nope you don't have to look at it
at all it's like it's not there that's
terrific okay oh please take just
they're so easy to use our thing yeah oh
that's great
join us again next week when I'll be
sharing my favorite Dogville recipes I'm
just kidding you guys we did a video on
10 reasons iPhones are better and now
androids getting the same treatment
after this message from our sponsor
LastPass LastPass relieves the burden of
trying to remember all your passwords
for every website let LastPass fill in
the passwords for you learn more at the
end of the video or through the link
below
so once again we've leaned on our
community to compile our list and
surprise surprise the number one most
commonly cited perk of Android is
customization
not only does Android lets you put your
app icons wherever you want including
places you can actually reach use non
hamstrung third-party keyboards a swift
key on iOS is just truly awful and
change your default browser to something
other than Safari it even lets you
change what's called the launcher which
is basically how your desktop
looks and feels for example the Google
pixel launcher has the actor are
available from a swipe up and the Google
now feed from a swipe right but you
don't need to have a pixel to make your
phone look like this other Android
phones can just download the pixel
launcher or one of the hundreds of other
launchers from the Play Store which whoa
Microsoft launcher does anyone use that
10 million downloads look the point is
that it's customizable and while it is
true that you can take more control of
your iPhone by jailbreaking it that
basically just unlocks features that
Android users already get out of the box
and Android offers an even deeper level
of customization if you root your phone
and install custom roms which are
basically alternative firmware with many
of them created for free by members of
the open-source community and they allow
you to do all kinds of crazy things like
removing bloatware overclocking for
better gaming performance underclocking
to extend battery life installing
updates as soon as they become available
instead of waiting for the OEM to push
them or even just changing what color
your notification light flashes speaking
of freedom
whereas unjailbroken iphones force you
to download any and all apps from the
App Store
on Android you can number to completely
bypass the Play Store by side loading
apps as many of you no doubt learned
when you installed fortnight for Android
apps are just dot apk files and they can
be downloaded and installed directly on
any Android phone as long as you've
enabled the capability in your phones
first apps that are side loaded don't
have to adhere to the Play stores rules
so some of them can be sketchy but there
are cases where the decision to go off
play store was driven by other reasons
like the developer not wanting to give
30% of their revenue to Google or
wanting to release a casino app that
lets you gamble with real currency or
just wanting to free the nipple as it
were the next level is that you can also
sideload apps that are themselves app
stores so you can actually have more
than one app store on your phone
for example the Amazon App Store used to
let you download one paid app per day
for free like there's no reason to miss
out on stuff like that and from a
developer perspective alternative and
often smaller app stores let you target
users of a specific niche or region I
mean the Google Play Store is not
accessible at all in China without a VPN
so if you want to access the Chinese
market you're gonna have to submit your
app to $0.10 my app or Baidu mobile
assistant number three took me a little
bit by surprise interaction with the
desktop now when you plug an Android
device into a PC it acts like pretty
much any other USB device or flash drive
and you can even use a conventional
drag-and-drop interface to access both
its onboard memory and an external
storage device such as a micro SD card
by contrast iPhones must interface with
the desktop via intermediary software
namely iTunes now to be clear it is
possible to be an iPhone user for years
without ever needing iTunes relying on
iCloud for backup and downloading stuff
directly to your phone using the files
app which came out with iOS 11 and thank
goodness because before that you
couldn't even download things from the
internet but if for some reason you need
to connect your iPhone to a computer
with a cable like to move music from
your phone to your computer then iTunes
is liable to be a huge pain in the booty
that prevents you from completing tasks
that would otherwise be very simple the
only exception is to copy pictures from
your iPhone
the computer that you can do and that's
because your computer sees the iPhone as
a read-only camera so you can't like
copy photos from your computer to your
iPhone something I discovered recently
when I tried to help my aunt move to a
new iPhone and I was like oh this should
be easy I'll just move all your old
photos onto your oops number 4
similar to the software side Android
gives you infinitely more choice when it
comes to hardware because Android is
open-source the software can be found
inside devices from myriad manufacturers
and this again gives you more freedom
because instead of saying well shucks I
don't really like what they did with
this year's iPhone I guess I'll wait
until next September's keynote
competition pushes OEMs to continually
innovate allowing consumers to vote with
their wallets on the features that they
care about headphone jacks stereo
speakers expandable storage screens
without notches all these treasures and
more await and of course this plurality
of devices represents number five
different price points not everyone
wants to or even can spend seven hundred
eight hundred fifteen hundred dollars on
a phone there are 400 million smartphone
users in India and only three percent of
them have iPhones
it's for a reason at seven hundred and
fifty dollars the budget iPhone is price
prohibitive for millions of people but
on Android there's a device for everyone
number six is split-screen multitasking
provided that you're using supported
apps Android lets you divide your screen
in two so you can say read an article
while you watch a twitch stream it's a
feature that some power users cannot
live without while others like myself
hardly bother using it but hey at least
we have the option the really bizarre
thing here is that iPads got support for
split view with 2017 iOS 11 including
the 7.9 inch iPad Mini but-but-but-but
no you can't use split view on your 6.5
inch iPhone 10s Macs because screw you
Apple doesn't think you should be able
to
number seven USB type-c adoption of USB
C is really picking up steam now and
having a standard interface on your
devices is the bee's knees because in
theory nearly every device in your house
could use the same cables I brought one
charger with me on my last trip and I
was able to use it for my phone my
laptop and my switch awesome but what's
weird is that while I could charge all
of those things including a MacBook if I
had one but it won't work with the
iPhone now granted in the past the
iPhones lightning connector was
definitely superior to USB micro-b it's
reversible and can handle more power but
USB C has closed the gap and even
surpassed lightning with many more
features and much higher data transfer
speeds and Apple honestly it just looks
kind of silly for not supporting it all
of their devices could have the same
port for the first time ever but no
number-8 Android has more unlock options
you can unlock your phone with a code a
pattern your face your eye or your
fingerprint depending on your device of
course and each method has its place
depending on context a fingerprint
reader whether you prefer it on the
front side back or even under the screen
glass is still more convenient than
facial recognition in some cases but
then face unlock is great to have to and
even passwords have their place what
doesn't have a place is fixing something
that ain't broken
I loved touch ID and I gave Apple a ton
of praise for it but then they went and
took it away probably forever even
though it would have been so awesome to
have the Apple logo just work as a
stealthy fingerprint reader like it's
just sad that they didn't do that
seriously
number 9 Android has a universal back
button now many of the Apple faithful
and even some Android users might find
this point controversial but hear me out
yes you can go back on an iPhone either
by swiping pressing the button in the
header or using safaris back button on
the bottom when it's visible which
method you use is totally dependent on
the app
but it's not the inconsistency here that
I have a problem with it's the
positioning the back button is easy to
reach on Android because it's right here
by your thumb and what's cool is that on
many phones you can even choose which
side you want it on but on the iPhone
right-handed people so that is most of
us have to reach all the way across our
increasingly ginormous screens to
initiate a swipe or even worse way up to
the top to reach the button now back
when iPhones were small one-handed
devices that was fine but this was
something I criticized back when they
launched the iPhone 6 and they still
haven't fixed it it's just not economic
I mean at least they let you swipe right
from anywhere on the home screen and
finally number 10 OLED screens yes
iPhones do finally have OLED screens now
starting from 2017 S iPhone 10 and while
it looks like all models will have OLED
starting in 2020 right now their
cheapest model still sports an LCD
meanwhile in Android OLED screens are
starting to appear even on mid-range
devices and they actually use it for
some reason Apple still has not given
its users always on display
functionality while some Android brands
have already started expanding the color
and interactivity even of their
always-on screen locks now I am NOT
saying Android is perfect software
updates hey with some handset makers
forget about it random battery dream I
have complained about that on this phone
it in particular the one that is my
daily driver manufacturer spying
scandals those have happened and also
just the fact that there's kind of
always it's always seems like there's a
compromise like there's no one perfect
device that has everything that you want
there's always some kind of an issue the
point I'm trying to make here is that
there are just plenty of reasons to buy
an Android just like there are plenty of
reasons to buy an iPhone and one reason
to enjoy your use of either of them is
