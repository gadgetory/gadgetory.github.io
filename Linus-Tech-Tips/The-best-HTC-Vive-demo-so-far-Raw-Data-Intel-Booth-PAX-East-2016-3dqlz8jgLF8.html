bringing us the packs these 2016 this
year my voice is gone but if you want to
see their stuff click the link in the
video description down below alright
guys welcome to the intel booth we are
checking out raw data from serbia sis is
hands down the best HTC vive demo i have
tried yet and it is far from completion
which is super cool it is an active
combat game so that means you're
standing up you're moving around you're
trying to deflect things with swords and
shoot things and go into bullet time and
god it's awesome the concept is fairly
basic we've seen it before you stand in
the middle of the room you defend
yourself and the things around you and
you kill waves of enemies that's not
super complicated but they add in some
great stuff that comes with VR like you
get basically a lightsaber it's a sword
but it's basically a lightsaber and you
can deflect incoming projectiles you can
physically dodge them you can go to
bullet time and dodge they'll meet your
bullet time and shoot people in the head
you have to hold on to different weapons
you can drop them pick them up using the
controller and you have to reload by
using your movement which is actually
super cool they do plan on adding things
in the future like traversable levels
and full locomotion so you can actually
travel through a level as you complete
it which is fantastic none of that like
teleport around kind of stuff which is
not super great in my opinion it's great
for immersion because of the intuitive
controls and the fact that you just kind
of expect something like a gun to be on
your hip and to reload pulling it down
back behind you feels very natural to
shoot a shotgun you have to hold it with
one hand pombo at the other hand again
feels very natural the whole game feels
very natural which is extremely
extremely important which is the reason
why to set it so many freaking times you
need to feel immersed when you're
playing a game things need to make sense
and they do which is great right now it
only supports land but they're actively
working on online multiplayer they will
get it working the game will be in early
access sometime in the summer and if
you're kind of like me and are probably
going to wait for the full version that
will be coming hopefully before the end
of this year so powering all this
awesomeness is three different systems
first of all we're going to check out
one of the clients which is an MSI gt70
2's this is an official like 5v r-rated
laptop which is pretty badass it has a
core i7 6820 HK 16 gigabytes of ddr4
memory and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 not a
9 ATM this is actually a fully fledged
desktop graphics card that's part of the
reason why it's rated for VR next up we
have the servers this is a full-fledged
desktop machine it's all water cooled
hardline badass stuff like that it has
an i7 6700 k 16 gigs of ddr4 memory and
a gtx 980 TI sli set up which is pretty
insane it also have a 750 series 400
gigabyte SSD now you don't need this you
want to play this game you don't need a
dedicated server at all you can have one
of the people host the game the other
person connect to you that is completely
okay the reason why they have a server
here is so that they can have a
spectator view someone who's able to
look around the level independent of the
two players and look at things
externally which are up on these TVs up
here and look super awesome at an event
but isn't actually required to run the
game and the last system is the client
for the second HTC vive set up this is a
custom side ax pc hopefully i'm saying
that name correctly it has an i7 6700 k
16 gigabytes of ddr4 memory dual nvidia
gtx titan exes at another 750 series SSD
again pretty badass hardware you can
probably get by with less than this but
I don't know if I stretch it that far
one way to check your BR capability is
to run steams VR check utility thing
it's actually pretty great I would
recommend doing that alright guys thanks
for watching thank you to logitech for

to show all of their stuff mike's
