mess in my garage since the last time i
did a tour of it there's Windex whoa
hold on restarting to catch some
finished product here so I have recoded
this table to have kind of a textured
finish on it it used to look so I'm just
going to zoom out here used to look like
this one horrible and grungy and white
and I'm hoping that this finish is
durable enough to withstand the kind of
abuse it's going to go through if not
we'll set it down and we'll do something
else it's got kind of a shine to it
there's another one that's in progress
right there but I gotta wait a week to
recoat it because I ran out of spray
bomb and yeah trouble so that leads us
to what have I been doing all this time
well for one thing that wall in the
corner now has three coats on it so to
coax primer one coat paint so we're
going to keep going at it until we
managed to get it very very uniform so
that I can pretty much white out
whatever is whatever find it so you can
hardly even see the corner there there
you can see it a little bit but we're
going to try and hide that as this
weekend the corner is probably also
touch wet I just painted it so easy
ready no yeah you can find the corner
that way but for the most part it's
pretty even we should be able to fix it
up and post got some more painting
supplies and whatnot and the red and
blue wall so this is pretty much what
this area is going to look like those
blue panels are going to go up on the
wall and the red is going to be well
very red as you can plainly see and I
just kind of wanted to see how these
colors looked in the camera more than
anything else right now let's fly it out
here but I figured I might as well
record it the vacuum cleaner will be
covered up by a couple of bookcases
which will be followed some cool
knickknacks that I want to store on them
and probably have to do something with
that door frame just right now it's in
pretty rough condition as you guys can
see if i zoom in here
yeah that's pretty horrible so yeah then
hard at work so my white clock set will
be done soon couple more a couple more
coats and then it will be wide enough in
uniform enough that i'll be happy with
it and then my blue and red set just
needs those tables so that one and then
the one that's behind over there and
then that one is pretty much ready to go
as well I got to figure out a way to
anchor those bookshelves and maybe
something to to prop them up on because
I want them up a little bit higher but
yeah it's starting to look good you'll
see you can see here that the red looks
very uneven here that's what I knew that
was going to be covered by the blue
panels so I didn't really keep coding it
I don't want to spend money on think I'm
not going to use so this is what the
finished wall will actually look like
you can see below that mark as well it's
very uniform again see here looks fine
so thank you for checking out my little
tour of what's been going on in my
garage over the last of the while don't
