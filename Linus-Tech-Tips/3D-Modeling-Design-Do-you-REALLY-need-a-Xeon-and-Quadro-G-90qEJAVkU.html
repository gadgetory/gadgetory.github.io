computer-aided design or CAD but you're
not quite sure what kind of a system
that you need do you really need one of
those multi-thousand dollar workstations
stuffed with pricey professional-grade
hardware or can you scrape by with
consumer gear to find out we loaded up
SolidWorks his website and looked at
their suggested system requirements
which were basically useless so then we
took it a step further and asked
SolidWorks to provide a license and
nvidia to provide some of their Quadro
graphics cards which they both
graciously provided and we resolved to
test it ourselves
today's video is brought to you by ZOTAC
their mech one PC is an ultra slim
desktop built for gaming featuring a
sleek robotic styled design check it out
now at the link below
let's get this out of the way right off
the bat
SolidWorks can be run on lower end
hardware a laptop with a core i5 CPU
integrated graphics and eight gigs of
RAM will actually get the job done just
fine if you're making single parts or
small assemblies let's say up to around
ten parts or so in fact I go as far as
to say that it'll be plenty to get you
through engineering one thousand three
but you won't get much further than that
the performance won't be optimal and
while on a desktop running a simulation
or a render for a day isn't going to be
an issue hitting a laptop with a hundred
percent load for 20 hours at a time
could end very poorly in fact that's how
Alex the writer of this episode lost his
first laptop back when he was in school
so you will need a desktop at some point
but there's a ton of information out
there about how that desktop should be
configured and it ranges from pretty
good - super outdated all the way to
downright misleading so to cut through
the BS we did a bunch of testing to give
you an idea of what kind of experience
you can expect with different classes of
hardware we used both spec view perf
which gives you an accurate look at CPU
and GPU performance while manipulating a
model and a render of this alpha cool
360 radiator to give us a feel for
rendering performance we'll discuss
different GPU choices first since a
small misstep here could easily cause
you to pay a high price for terrible
performance on that subject NVIDIA
GeForce lineup might look pretty good on
paper or when compared to intel's
integrated graphics for example but once
you line it up against AMD's rx 580 and
Vega line up they get completely stomped
at times the real-world performance
between the two is actually you
Julie similar to what you might expect
with a gtx 1070 being within spitting
distance of uh vega 56 and so on and so
forth but this changes dramatically when
you throw contours and shaded edges into
the mix which for some reason completely
tanked the consumer grade GeForce
drivers with all of that said team red
shouldn't act too high and mighty here
because big and hot Vega 64 is
impressive lead melts away immediately
when you pull out the big guns or rather
the really small guns this is the entry
level and power sipping quadrille p1000
that stomped all over all but the
highest end consumer cards and then from
there the quad Rose which also have
extra features like real view rendering
continue their dominance thanks to their
superior driver pathway like the p2000 a
$600 card was able to beat out the Titan
V which is a $3,000 card and a prosumer
one at that the only real oddity here
was that the P 5000 and the P 6,000
ended up beating the GP 100 maybe this
was thanks to our particular workload
favoring higher clock speeds over higher
memory bandwidth with all that said not
everyone can afford a thousand plus
dollars for a mid tier quad row so our
budget recommendation is an rx 580 if
you're a student who plans to mostly
game and occasionally solidworks it up
you'll be really happy with its
excellent bang for the buck but if
you're doing any kind of professional
work you need to get a Quadro the sweet
spot seems to be the P 4000 it's
relatively affordable and its
performance allows you to create massive
models with 500 plus components in 4k
without drops in framerate with that
said if your firm wants to throw some of
that sweet sweet engineering money your
way a P 5000 will tear through just
about anything
that you could throw at it as a side
note here by the way SolidWorks doesn't
support multiple GPUs so SLI won't give
you any benefit whatsoever
moving on to CPU options for modeling in
theory all you should be concerned about
is single core performance meaning that
the core i7 8700 K should be the winner
and in the real world it is and buy a
lot now that's not to say that
multi-threaded muscle will go completely
unused though for simulations and for
rendering the time to complete goes down
nearly directly proportionally to the
number of course that you can throw at
the problem and this makes Intel's Core
I 9s and Xeon W's and AMD's thread
ripper chips look pretty attractive for
folks who plan on doing this kind of
work regularly with that being said if
you're doing lots of rendering it will
probably be in keyShot or blender and
simulations will probably be taken care
of by abacus or Altair hyper works in
which case high multi-threaded
performance yeah it's still definitely a
good thing but a core i9 is out of the
question because intel's h EDT lineup
lacks support for ECC memory xeon W's
will have a hard time justifying their
trade-off in terms of price and thread
Ripper single threaded performance makes
it far less appealing
besides for most CAD designers these
types of workloads can easily be set to
run after hours and usually with help
from other nodes on the network bottom
line then unless you're trying to build
a one-size-fits-all type of machine in
which case you might have to spring for
a Xeon w4 modeling the core i7 8700 k is
still our recommendation as for AMD's
Rison processors they're just
unfortunately not an optimal choice for
SolidWorks and 8700 K in our testing
with a quadrille P 5000 scored eight
percent better than an r7 1800 x with a
Quadro piece 6000 and the 1800 X also
losses in multi-threaded workloads as
for system memory you're going to need
16 gigs
ran as a minimum but you won't need more
than that until you're working with
models that are well over 500 parts in
size and as for SSDs we found that nvme
or obtain SSDs didn't have an
appreciable impact on performance beyond
how quickly your model will load though
as a reminder here we were really
focused on modeling rather than
simulation performance so in summary
then if we were to recommend a computer
for SolidWorks
we consider the best bang for the buck
budget workstation right now to be an
intel core i7 8700 k a quadrille p 4,000
16 gigs of ram and a 512 gig SSD placed
in whatever case is quiet with great
airflow so for our workstation which
will be keeping together we've got a
silverstone fto for now when and if
entry-level 6-core coffee lake Zeon's
show up they could change our
recommendation here depending on pricing
but for the time being they don't exist
so they're not an option now if you want
to scale our build down you can save a
buck with a core i5 8400 but I wouldn't
go much lower and you can swap out that
P 4000 with ap1000 or a P 2000 as your
budget allows if you want to scale our
build up however because maybe you
convinced your boss that well time is
money you know and he or she gave you a
blank check for a build then you will
get some more benefit all the way up to
the top end like yeah Xeon w21 95 which
is the 18 core equivalent to the core on
an Extreme Edition and a Quadro p6
thousands so if for whatever reason
you've got that option then go for it
not because it actually makes a ton of
sense we talked about that already but
rather because that's sick hardware and

do it speaking of doing things if your
