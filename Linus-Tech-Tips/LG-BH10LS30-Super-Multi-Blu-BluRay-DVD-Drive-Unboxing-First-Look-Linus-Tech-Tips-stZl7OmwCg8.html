look at the LG oh wow
B H 10 LS 30 blu-ray writer so this is a
10x blu-ray writer and one thing that
I've been really surprised to see is how
fast the Blue Wave ray writing speeds
have come up without the cost of the
blu-ray drives actually going down
back when CDs and DVDs we're going
through their evolutionary steps of the
costs going down and the writing speeds
going up we saw sort of a more a more
gradual shift whereas these the write
speeds are just kind of doubling every
time we see a new set of a blu-ray
writers come out whereas the prices are
staying that pretty level I mean they
are coming down don't get me wrong
blu-ray writers are finally getting to
the point where they are getting
affordable but you still don't see too
many OEM blu-ray drives which is why
we're looking at a retail box product
here so okay this is good for full HD
quality which it better be if it's a
blu-ray drive then you've got BD 10x so
that's the fastest burning speed they're
saying is available out there and
includes oh it includes some 6x blu-ray
writable media that's very cool it's
compatible with Windows 7 that's
terrific and then here's the full specs
on the side not sure if you're gonna be
able to read that that's okay so this
includes silent play technology it's an
HD TV reporter upgrade your DVD to HD
quality okay I'm guessing this is all of
the software features that are included
jam list play watch a normal disk drive
when a normal disk drive plays a blog
with scratches or finger prints the
drive can become element on the old play
certain scene jam this play can help the
describe to play the movie smoother very
cool Music Video Creator etcetera etc
etc okay so why don't we get this open
and see what comes with our retail
blu-ray writers so the first thing we'll
find inside is that sample piece of
blu-ray media okay that is a very
significant value add because this stuff
is very expensive at this time it has a
metal knight nitride base recording wall
help some good something about HD
picture okay then we have in terms of
accessories we've got Wow an actual
accessory package I you know what I
haven't actually used a retail optical
drive ever so it's some interesting to
see what comes with them so first of all
you have four mounting screws so if
you're vice if you own like like a big
box computer or something
like that you may actually need mounting
screws because they don't include them
whereas if you're buying like a piece
together custom machine your case would
include all the mounting screws you need
same goes for cables your motherboard
would include the cables but if you're
buying a pre-built computer it might not
include all the cables you need so you
have the SATA cable as well as a molten
molex to SATA power adapter then you
have a product registration form that
you should fill out and register your
product with then you have a declaration
of Conformity oh yeah something about
FCC rules okay that's great
then you've got a limited warranty card
and an owner's manual okay so that's in
a bunch of different languages tells you
about you know how to use disks don't
use them if they're like warped or
trapped or such okay then you have the
super multi blue install disk for
Windows okay so that includes all of
your site includes CyberLink PowerDVD
power to go media show power producer
and you can awesome okay then let's have
a look at the drive itself I'm expecting
this to look pretty much like any other
optical drive that you would see well
it's got a bit of a heft to it which is
kind of kind of interesting I mean you'd
expect that as they Jam more and more
lasers into these things but okay so at
the front of the drive you can see it
looks pretty much like any other optical
drive ever you just can peel up the
sticker oh it has kind of a that's kind
of nice it's got like these horizontal
stripes on it that make it look a little
bit sort of different okay you can kind
of kind of see that you can also see
around my room because it's very very
very shiny
alright then on the top of the drive you
got a little sticker calling out your
part number telling you to be careful
with laser products on the sides you can
see you got your four mounting holes so
this is compatible with pretty much any
five and a quarter inch pay device our
big computer as long as you have a free
Bay at the bottom there is nothing and
then at the back you've got your SATA
interface so there's your SATA power and
there's your state of data thank you for
checking out my unboxing the LG super
multi blue</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
