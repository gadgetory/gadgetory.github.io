I personally am of the philosophy that
expensive products should come with
expensive accessories already but it
almost seems like it works the opposite
way doesn't it folks where the more
expensive a product is the more the
manufacturer kind of goes ah okay they
can afford it don't worry about it so
this guy right here this is my annex
whatever the heck is called fs700 camera
like eighty five hundred bucks with the
lens kit didn't come with a carrying
case no I have to spend another hundred
bucks or two hundred dollars or whatever
this thing ended up costing me on a
carrying case because I have to take
that camera with me to CES which I am of
course super super excited about so
let's have a look at what Pelican has to
say for themselves as if no one's ever
heard of a Pelican case anyway
alright Pelican cases what are they good
for whoo uh a lot of stuff that Alka
automatic pressure purge valve one-way
membrane that releases air pressure but
keeps moisture out so yeah they're
waterproof easy-open double-throw
latches secondary movement works like a
pry bar to open with a light pole you
know it's a genuine Pelican case by that
unique dual band design metal reinforced
padlock protectors for added strength
and extra security pullout polymer rings
provide a watertight seal for ultimate
protection so basically these are the
way to transport super expensive
sensitive fragile equipment long
distances in rough conditions with no
risk to them now you know it's funny
because I harp on packing materials you
know I always say oh it's gonna have a
soft foam and good for something like
this I'd actually be disappointed if it
did have any packing materials inside
the case because that to me would be an
indication that the manufacturer doesn't
think it's suitable as a shipping
container so you'll be pleased to see
there are absolutely no packing
materials whatsoever in the box for my
pelican 1510 case what else they say
guarantee is its products for a lifetime
against breakage or defects and
workmanship they're guaranteed to be
water-type to a depth of 3.3 feet for 30
minutes unless otherwise stated does not
cover lamps or batteries etc etc etc no
abuse clean and inspect the o-ring
regularly what else we got to say for
ourselves here metal reinforced padlock
protector 17 inch locking retractable
extension handle non-slip rubberized
handles an automatic pressure purge belt
have you do urethane wheels so here it
is alright so what do we got here
there's our there's our heavy-duty
handle which has a rubberized bottom for
more comfort when you're carrying it so
it's got a little bit of softness to it
but not much you can see there's thick
thick metal bolts through not one of it
I mean even if one of these breaks off
it's not going anywhere so I'd expect to
be able to basically swing this thing
around by its handle without any
difficult heavy but you know other than
that without any difficulty here's our
extending carrying handle which again is
using an encrypted sort of construction
there's no like telescoping metal
sliders this is just like a spring a
spring-loaded thing here that fits into
a notch at the bottom and it's not going
anywhere
like I could put all my weight on this
and it's not going anywhere just like
that alright so you can lock that into
place you can carry it by that if you
want on the side you've got phenomenally
rugged looking hinges I'm actually
feeling pretty good about this purchase
even though it's basically a you know I
think I saw the invoice for it when I
was unboxing and it's like you know a
couple hundred dollar hunk of plastic
essentially how much was it pure stone
care stone Pelican case yeah 140 bucks
hundred and forty dollar piece of
plastic but I'm feeling pretty good I
mean looking at stuff like this and how
it's got nice long metal rods that go
through you know one two three like a
triple hinge sort of design here okay
the wheels look like wheels so nothing
out of the ordinary there and here we go
here's the main carrying handle so this
guy is again our rubber bottom and then
again it's got sort of two pieces of
metal our two pieces of plastic
interlocked with three on either side
there's those metal reinforced padlock
spots not one but two of them so in
theory if you were going to use this as
like a if you were going to check it at
the airport or what
or else it should be harder to cut your
padlocks off and let's go ahead see
there's the front so there's some chick
in a wetsuit over 40 sizes automatic
pressure where did that pressure valve
go where is that here's the bottom looks
like it could take some sliding without
any difficulty I didn't see the pressure
valve oh yeah there it is
hiding right under my hand genuine
Pelican case alright let's open this
baby up and see what we got okay so then
okay ah there we go so it latches kind
of twice okay so it goes down once but
then comes up twice okay neat and it
comes with super thick foam inside which
you can actually totally customize okay
so thank you for your purchase warranty
card or something like that special
instructions humidity o-ring cleaning
instructions solid foam comes with a
solid foam follow these steps to
customize your layout lay out all the
items on top of the foam so I for
example we take something like my camera
and I'd put it here it's obvious I'm not
going to get my shotgun mic in there at
the same time using chalk trace around
the items to create an outline leave at
least one inch of foam between the items
and the walls of the case so you can't
go too close to the walls I don't want
you to just you know eat it all up here
so remove components from the foam with
the foam for treating blah blah blah use
an 8 inch electric knife or very sharp
blade and begin cutting when you
simplify but steak has made use a rubber
cement or spray adhesive to repair the
foam remove chalk outline with the damp
cloth we move the table
we recommend gluing the cut section so
basically this one seems to come with
little squares so you could just pull
out the squares although some of them
have solid foam so you would have to cut
that you can see you can remove however
many squares you want to make your
equipment fit and it goes all the way
down the entire depth of the case so you
can see these are cut all the way
through or perforated all the way
through so you can do whatever you need
to do to get whatever gear you want
packed into here and then there's one
more layer of foam at the bottom for the
ultimate and protection so I've heard
that this Pelican case is a good fit for
this particular camera so we'll have to
figure out how exactly it goes in there
this piece comes off it's just a matter
of bone like this and removing
and then this piece comes off so it
looks like it's going to fit in there
just fine kind of right there and then
some accessories can go around it and we
should be good to go for our trip to CES
