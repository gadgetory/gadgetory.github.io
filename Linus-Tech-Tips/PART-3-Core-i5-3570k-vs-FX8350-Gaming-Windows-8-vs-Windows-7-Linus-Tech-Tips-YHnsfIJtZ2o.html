visit www.samhsa.gov/dtac 350 until vs
AMD with a different spin on it we're
going to be looking at windows 7 and
windows 8 performance and showing you
not only which is the best hardware
platform for your gaming today but also
which is the best software platform with
a variety of games so I'd like to
introduce you to our 2 test platforms
first of all we've got the crosshair 5
formula with an FX 8350 at 4.6 gigahertz
and 8 gigs of black line mush keen
memory 1600 megahertz nothing special
about its cl9 memory I know it looks
special but that copperhead spreaders
just for looks
then our author bench is a 35 70 K at
4.2 gigahertz a Maximus 5 formula 8 gigs
of that same memory for consistency and
we're running a 660ti overclocked in
both of the systems so we've got a
Windows 8 and Windows 7 SSD and then
we're running on an ax 850 with an H 100
for our cooling now the reason we went
with those over clocks on the cpus is
that they are overclocked but
conservatively anyone with these chips
should be able to attain these over
clocks we've also overclocked them
proportionally close to their maximum
typically people are getting anywhere
from 4.8 to 4.9 on an 80 350 and
anywhere from around 4.4 to 4.5 on a 35
70 K so the real question here is why
are we testing this and the reason for
it is that you guys asked us to you
asked us to do an in-depth examination
of the 35 70 K versus the 80 350 and we
want to look at it from every angle
possible silver we've got a baby
touching the mic can you let go of that
sir
alright so we're gonna be looking at it
with anti-aliasing without anti-aliasing
on Windows 8 on Windows 7 we're also
going to be looking at some different
scenarios like running higher speed
memory on both platforms to see how that
affects it so guys stay tuned make sure
you're subscribed so that you're going
to see all of our coverage of this
another thing that I'd like to bring up
on this one is the cost difference
between these chips this was brought up
on the last video they don't cost
exactly the same especially when you
factor in the different
of the platform's so we ran a quick cost
analysis here showing you guys that the
platform's are not really quite equal so
the 35 70k is around 220 to 240 bucks
and the 8350 is around 200 to 220 bucks
depending where you're shopping so
there's already about a 20 dollar
difference however we always factor in
overclocking because we believe we've
done enough guides on overclocking that
any enthusiast should be doing it but
you cannot overclock an Intel platform
unless you have an overclocking friendly
chipset like a z68 or z77 chipset
however on AMD you can buy a cheapo 970
board and you can overclock your chip so
our cheapest z77 board is a hundred and
twenty bucks that we found where as our
cheapest not even quite the cheapest but
the cheapest one I'd be confident
putting an eight core on was around
eighty bucks so there is potentially up
to a sixty dollar difference in the
prices between these platforms but you
might say you don't like to see us
compare it you know non-equal chipset
tears but even if you take boards that
we would consider pretty equivalent like
the crosshair 5 formula and the Maximus
5 formula there's a $50 difference in
price between these boards now arguably
the Intel board does have more bells and
whistles so it has lighting effects on
it and it has you know more onboard
buttons and doodads and better onboard
sound yes it does have things the AMD
board doesn't but these are similar
class of products and so you're looking
at as much as a $70 difference then
between the two platforms so bear that
in mind as you look at the performance
results that we're about to present in
our first game Far Cry 3 which you can
check out our benchmarking procedure for
by clicking the link below we saw a
significant performance improvement
going from windows 7 to Windows 8 it was
a little less than 10 percent but it was
reproducible it was anywhere from about
5 to 8 percent for both platforms we
didn't really see any changes in the
positioning with the I mean with both of
them being within margin of error we'd
say this is a tie between the 83 50 and
the 35 70 K in terms of performance
remembering the 8350 platform could be
cheaper with Crysis 3 we saw something
really cool in Windows 7
when slick fires the explosive arrow at
the turret we've seen this time and time
again on the AMD platform the FPS dips
to around 20 frames per second with
whatever optimizations Microsoft has
made in terms of leveraging more cores
better in Windows 8 we don't see it
anymore both platforms dip to a minimum
of around 30 fps at that particular
segment although they don't on average
actually perform any better on Windows 8
than Windows 7 so what that means to me
is although minimums have smoothed out
on both platforms just more noticeably
on the AMD one the averages are not
really any higher which means maximum
Czar down a little bit that does deliver
a better gaming experience though lower
averages with higher minimums is better
than huge averages with low dips our
next game is battlefield 3 and in this
one we really just didn't see much
change in terms of averages but both
platforms improved in terms of their
minimum frames per second so the 8350
went from 35 to 43 and the 35 70k went
all the way from 37 to 51 fps delivering
a much smoother gaming experience moving
from windows 7 to Windows 8 in Skyrim
Intel maintains its dominance however it
should be noted that our Skyrim install
has 18 mods from the workshop so we're
not really a hundred percent sure how
those affect the performance on
individual chips but we just kind of
added mods until the game looked great
and went with it so for better or for
worse that's what we do in that game the
Intel chip did see about a 20% uplift in
minimum FPS resulting in better overall
performance even so even compared to
Windows 7 so Windows 8 once again wins
is the gaming platform here dirt 3 is a
bit of a different story where the 35
70k drops in performance both in terms
of minimums and in terms of averages in
Windows 7 it was a clear win for the 35
70k whereas in Windows 8 the 35 70k is
about a dead tie however it should be
noted that when you're running at 150
plus frames per second unless you're
running some kind of space-age LCD
monitor that does 240 frames per second
then you're probably not going to notice
so there you go guys
in which or two we didn't see much in
the way of strange behavior but we did
see improvements again going from
windows 7 to Windows 8 so the
three-fifty particularly went from 51
minimum to 59 minimum
although the averages didn't change much
so we're seeing another one of those
situations where minimums improve
averages don't really improve much which
gives you smoother overall gameplay
whereas the 35 70k only improved about
5% and we're gonna call this one pretty
much a tile though the 35 70k does edge
out the 8350 in Metro 2033 we see
another huge improvement for the 8350
with the 35 70k holding steady so it was
about a 10% improvement in minimum
frames per second which drove up the
average delivering a smoother gameplay
experience than Windows 7 and bringing
it actually slightly ahead of the 35 70
K although it should be noted that this
is within the margin of error for our
tests in Crysis 2 we saw pretty much no
change across the board which makes
sense because this is a much older title
and we shouldn't be seeing too many new
optimizations that are implemented for
it
so guys while we showed you all the
performance numbers here there are some
things that you didn't see so Windows 8
looks like the stronger platform in
terms of gaming performance but we did
have to jump through some hoops to get
some of the games working at all so for
example there were games that wouldn't
work until you installed games for
Windows Live uninstalled the game having
already tried to install it once and
then completely reinstalled the game the
other thing that you don't see is that
while the performance of the 83 50 and
the 35 70 K is quite similar there's
that price difference I talked about
before and also the fact that the 83 50
does run hotter so if your room is above
say for example a garage and it's not
air-conditioned and it gets hot in the
summer and you're on the south side of
the house then heat output may matter to
you and it does consume more power so
this comes down to the individual user
whether that's important to you or not
so it's that cost performance and other
intangibles trade-off thanks for
