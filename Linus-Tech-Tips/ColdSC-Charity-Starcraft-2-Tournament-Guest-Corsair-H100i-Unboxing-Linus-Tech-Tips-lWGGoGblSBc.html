guys my contribution to the video is
actually going to be pretty limited I am
just providing sort of the channel for
Richard to talk about his charity
tournament I am providing an adorable
cat which I think we can all agree that
every internet video needs Rumble say hi
to the audience so now I'm gonna get
Richard to cover the overall details of
the charity we'll get our on the event
and we'll get his mom actually who runs
the charity to first explain what this
charity is all about come on in mrs.
slick hi I started this charity after
watching my dad take care of my mom who
has Alzheimer's and realized that caring
for an adult is one of the hardest jobs
in the world and that they can really
use a break sometimes they're often very
isolated and so we provide a dinner and
entertainment at no cost to the
caregivers just to say we really
appreciate what you're doing and we do
that once a year and you being in this
tournament is going to help do that so
thank you very much all right Richard
okay guys we'll tell you about the
tournament it's going to be on December
7th 8th and 9th I'm going to split it up
into three codes with code be playing on
the 7th that's the Friday code a will be
playing on the 8th and code s will be
playing on the 9th we're gonna do a 50
player cap I would love to hit that now
it's an online tournament all online
there's no overhead and there's gonna be
a $5 buy em where your 5 dollars is
going is 2 dollars and 50 cents will be
going straight to cash prizes with 2
dollars and 50 Cent's going straight
into the charity and I'm the
but yeah and so if your money is going
to a great cause and part of your money
will be going straight to the prize pool
it's also if you're a client code B all
the players in quote B that money will
stay in code B nothing will be
getting final to code s it's gonna be a
wide-open tournament for everybody to
