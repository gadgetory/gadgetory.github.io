September usually earlier rather than
later Apple announces a new iPhone of
some sort and for three years in a row
now the day of Apple's event has marked
a measurable downturn in viewership on
our channel because we typically don't
talk about it so you know what yeah
let's talk about the new iPhone XS which
confounding Lee is not in fact a tiny
iPhone and the YouTube analytics that
have driven me to drop everything that
I'm doing and do that instead of playing
with this much more exciting 48 port 10
gigabit network switch which I've been
actually having a lot of fun yeah yeah
and today's video is brought to you by
Optima Optimas be sport 3 wireless
headphones feature 10 hour battery life
and an IP 55 water resistance rating
learn more at the link in the video
description
okay here we go so the new Apple watch
series 4 has a curved screen haptic
feedback on the crown louder speakers a
better processor some new health
features including ECG capabilities
that's actually pretty sick and it is
thinner than ever before the iPhone 10s
has made a stainless steel in gold
silver and Space Gray with ip68 water
resistance and very durable glass it's
got a five point eight inch OLED 2436 by
1125 display with HDR and the place
where someone took a bite out of it and
it is faster than ever with gigabit
class LTE and their new seven nanometers
six core a 12 Bionic SOC that boasts 50%
better GPU performance and a much faster
mural engine for AI and machine learning
stuff it's got up to 512 gigs of storage
better battery than the iPhone 10 dual
SIM support with both eason and physical
cards so it looks like appellees finally
taking India seriously how did that take
so long and it now both plays and
records stereo sound which is pretty
sweet the 10s max is all that stuff I
just said but bigger and pricier with a
six and a half inch display apparently
justifying it being the most expensive
mainstream smartphone ever at $1,100 to
start and that's it oh except one more
thing this Apple we know there's a notch
just own it you guys know that this
picture your first promo image makes the
phone look like an all screen design
when it isn't which way no that wasn't
the one were things sorry the iPhone 10
are it's aluminum instead of steel with
lots of colourful designs it's got a
smaller screen also not and I guess I
guess they're all in on that now and the
screen is LCD rather than OLED which is
somehow a selling point that gets a sexy
new name liquid retina
okay then it's got the same a twelve
Bionic chip it is still water-resistant
although only ip67 and it's got the same
face ID system as the 10s and the 10s
max so basically there are a couple key
takeaways for this one
one the home button is not coming back
and to anyone holding out from the 5c or
the SE for a decent value phone from
Apple is getting one heck of an upgrade
they're spending a little more for it
it's still 750 bucks but even with the
cost down haptic touch versus 3d touch
and the single rear camera it actually
really looks like you aren't giving up
much okay then everybody happy
we covered the iPhone 10s now let's talk
about why I bothered to do all of that
and what Google has to do with any of
this now I want to get this out of the
way first because it's important to be
very clear I'm not upset about this
situation because I hate the iPhone or
something I wasn't a huge fan of the 10
but I named one of them I think it was
the 6s my smart phone of the year when
it came out we just generally don't do
this kind of content for anything on
this channel and I've gone back and
forth on it a lot of times over the
years it's possible I'll change my
position again but I've always just kind
of had it knowing at the back of my mind
that summarizing a press conference is a
convenient little helping hand for
anyone who doesn't have two hours to
listen to Apple talk about how many
facial muscles they can track Fran
emojis now but other than that it's
basically marketing for Apple because
until I actually have my hands on the
device and I don't mean the kind of
structured hands-on you get at these
events but but actual time spent with it
is my daily driver I often end up
feeling like I don't have a ton to
contribute to the conversation because
literally every tech publication in the
world is chomping at the bit to publish
their spin on what is essentially all
the same information whatever Apple or
for that matter Samsung or whoever said
during their keynote making me even more
hesitant about this type of content is
my personal opinion that video really
isn't the best medium for a a bullet
point summary of information I mean I
personally can skim a written article
much faster than I can skip through a
video even with YouTube's very helpful
by the way of live previews of the
navigation bar so then on to the actual
need of this video the way that Google's
algorithm basically forces content
creators to jump onto the bandwagon when
a topic trends hard enough at the
beginning of this video I alluded to the
dips in viewership that we've seen right
around Apple's September keynote for the
last few years so let's take a closer
look at that note the 2015 and 2016
impacts are pretty obvious even to the
untrained eye the day after the Apple
Keynote marks a multi-week low in LTT
viewership but then 2017 is a bit of a
trickier one and requires a deeper dive
into the analytics there's no obvious
crater here but it was actually last
year that we finally felt that we had
confirmation of this pattern so the
morning of September 12th Apple made
their announcement that day a few hours
later after a short experimental stream
commentating the event we launched a
video looking at a budget $60 CPU
compared to a $600 one and that video
performed pretty well 650,000 views in
the first couple days was pretty good
for us at that time then we followed up
that video with three reasons not to buy
a $400 laptop a video that killed it for
us 850,000 views in the first couple
days at that time was great and would
usually result in a noticeable uplift
for the channel one that didn't come for
should you upgrade to rising the video
that came out the next day so here's
what was happening like I'm not
suggesting that YouTube wasn't
delivering our videos to sub boxes or
that they were making some kind of
intentional effort to undermine us
because Google like really really loves
the iPhone so much
or whatever the answer is way less
tinfoil Hattie than that and actually
more interesting so think about your own
experience watching videos on YouTube if
you watch one stupid tractor video all
of a sudden your home page and watch
next is full of videos about farming
well it's the same thing now in the
technique we don't generally deal with
events that are you know relevant to
pretty much every human with a pulse
very often so we're usually sheltered
from this on smartphones are about the
most mainstream tech thing that there is
and you know you could say well what
about Android even though Android holds
significantly more market share than iOS
there's no individual model of device
that sells anything like a hot iPhone
and while a die-hard Apple fan would
have no need to know anything about or
how to operate some Android handset
pretty much every Android user probably
at least knows someone with an iPhone
and needs still at least a little bit
about it even if it's just to put
together an argument to make to their
friends for why they shouldn't buy it or
whatever so that's the Apple effect
everyone needs to know about it so
that's what happens every September
you guys all watch one freaking iPhone
video and then because everyone is
making one YouTube spans your feed with
more iPhone content and you either watch
it shifting your algorithmic waiting
from techie to iPhone E or you get sick
of it and you turn off YouTube all
together for a few days and you can
actually see the effect right here in
the 2017 data search channel pages and
suggested videos all look normal but
browse features absolutely tanks from
the 12th to the 15th finally fully
recovering on the 17th when our keyboard
with no actual keys video went semi
viral and got picked up hard by the
algorithm after the iPhone dust had
settled
so I hope this video was enlightening
interesting entertaining something for
both those of you who wanted a
convenient summary of the new iPhones
and for those of you wondering why the
heck everyone in your sub box felt
compelled to make an iPhone video today
I'm gonna go back and play with my
networks which look after I tell you
about mass drop math drops ctrl keyboard
it's got it all it's constructed with a
solid cnc aluminum frame with a built in
switch plate to make it stable and
extremely durable it's fully
programmable with RGB lighting and qmk
firmware which makes it much easier to
program giving you more control
it's got onboard memory to keep your
profile on your keyboard and at checkout
you can choose between Cherry MX chi-wah
and halo switches which of course will
affect the price depending on your
choice but if you ever did want to
change your switches out in the future
you can actually hot swap them out
making this keyboard truly your own
without needing to know how to solder so
pick it up today on mass drop at the
link below for a limited time only
