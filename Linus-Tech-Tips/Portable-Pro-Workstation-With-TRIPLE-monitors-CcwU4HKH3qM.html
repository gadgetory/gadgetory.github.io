Computex 2018 their new crystal to ATX
case looks freaking awesome and you can
check it out at the link in the video
description my friends we are here in
like 70s cartoon land where Acme
portable is a company that actually
exists and these guys make pretty
bananas computers so this right here is
an iMac but you would never recognize it
because the whole thing oh oh I dropped
the mouse is contained in this sort of
portable handled briefcase and closure
thing now this is not your average
computer for your average user what we
got in here is a couple of latches so
let's go ahead and release this baby yes
my friends this portable computer has
one two three displays on it so there is
almost nothing left of the original iMac
that was inside there's a little window
at the back where you've got access to
the i/o there's a rerouted power plug
over here on this side so you can power
the whole thing so we use the term
monitor to describe anything that sort
of creates an image off of a computer
but this is a professional-grade monitor
so it's running on like an SDI
connection you can have scopes on it
everything that you see here is color
accurate to exactly the way that you
would experience it in the theater so a
device like this these are just kind of
more more normal 4k monitors so a device
like this is intended for like Hollywood
productions like let's say they're
shooting something out in the middle of
like desert nowhere and they need a
machine that they can use to ingest
footage on the go or you know throw a
shot up and see how the colors look do a
little bit of lay okay maybe we need to
do like a little bit of CG work
something like a laptop wouldn't be
suitable this is what they would use now
it's gonna cost you a pretty penny this
guy starts at around fifteen thousand US
dollars but on a production like you
know what you're looking at here you're
gonna need something that's got this
kind of like aluminum construction and
like huge rubber stoppers all over it or
it will not survive and they do all
kinds of crazy specialized systems like
check out this one so this one is
designed for air traffic control it's a
little bit more flexible in terms of the
configuration this what's freakin heavy
by the way I can barely lift it but it
can hold up to a full ATX standard
computer desktop standard ATX power
supply here come on around this side
with me it's got a wack ton of cooling
fans so we've got 120 120 another 120
fan all filtered so you can see these
filters are gonna be able to keep dust
out of there and then it's got five
hopefully we can rotate that but it's
got five drive bays over here on the
back and another 140 millimeter cooling
fan Oh an optical drive in case you're
into that sort of thing now this one is
designed for apparently flight
simulation and remote air traffic
control and check this out yes my
friends you saw it here first a
hydraulic lift dual display computer
I'm just got a pause and let you have
the whole experience so this is a cherry
switch keyboard you got your built-in
little touchpad here you plug this
little guy in and boom so the
applications for this mostly not
civilian but military loves this kind of
thing because they can take it with them
on the go and monitor any planes in the
air using a well Anthony what's the
thing called using something like an
AWACS this one starts at 20,000 US
dollars so unless you've got that
military budget you probably won't be
buying one for yourself but we just
thought this was pretty freakin cool and
figured you guys might want to check it
out oh oh yeah last thing let me close
it up whoop they were very proud of this
magnetic latch you know
so this video is brought to you by
Corsair Corsairs new crystal series -
ATX and - ATX RGB bring tempered glass
to a smaller form factor if they look a
little similar to the air 240 that's for
reasons so they've got the same
chambered cooling design in an updated
look that I think looks absolutely
fantastic both models the regular one
and the RGB one are available in black
and white includes two of their light
loupe fans and their lady no digital RGB
controller which works with their new IQ
software so check out the 280 acts today
at the link in the video description so
