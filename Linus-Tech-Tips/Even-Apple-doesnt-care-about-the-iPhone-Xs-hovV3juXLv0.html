the only one who noticed at least until
I read this comment on Mac rumors from
user Roman Empire but while I was
watching the September 2018 keynote I
was blown away that even Apple's own
executives who need I remind you managed
to muster at least some excitement about
the iPhone 5c just didn't seem to care
about their newest and shiniest
flagships why didn't they care what
could compel someone to upgrade their
existing iPhone 10 what are the selling
points here what could compel someone to
upgrade even an iPhone 7 for that matter
and why hasn't linus segwayed into the
sponsor for this video yet oh right no
that was it today's video is brought to
you by Origin PC origin PCs Evo 15s
weighs only 4.3 pounds features a smooth
144 Hertz 1080p display and an nvidia
geforce gtx 1070 max q check out their
latest deals at the link below
I actually almost bailed on this video
entirely in favor of a totally different
concept where I walked around like men
on the street style and pretended to
show people the latest new iPhone except
it was actually just gonna be an iPhone
10 because honestly even I a tech nerd
would need to install Ida or check the
model number or the storage capacity of
one of the new 512 gig models to know
that it's a 2018 model year unless it
was gold that's that's the one new thing
this year a gold-colored so the truth is
I've actually spent the last couple of
weeks using the iPhone 10s max as my
everyday phone and I've been struggling
to find anything to say about this thing
that isn't a list of petty complaints
many of which I've given up any hope
that Apple will even fix and I'm just
I'm having a really hard time so I guess
all we can do is get into it almost
immediately after opening the box
I began missing my samsung galaxy note 9
it's got a bigger screen it's got a more
subtle rounding of the corners meaning
you get more usable screen real estate
and oh right when I slid out the SIM
tray no expandable storage still and not
even dual SIM on this model now I talked
about this in my note 9 review but the
remarkable thing about that phone is the
zero compromises nature of it it's big
and it's expensive but other than a
lackluster commitment to software
support which is something Samsung
really does need to address it gives up
nothing
by contrast on my over $1000 new iPhone
I haven't even installed my first app
and I find myself reaching for my stupid
headphone dongle but when I already had
mind you because they don't even include
one in the box anymore
and I'm staring at what well at first
looked like a massive not by late 2018
standards at least that is until Google
released the pixel 3 XL and the cave
changed something that's neither here
nor there
while I'm whining I really really hate
the name of the iPhone 10s for those of
you who are wondering the last time
Apple used Roman numeral
it's product naming scheme was 1994 and
they never went higher than three why
would that be well because it's
confusing almost no one that I know in
the mainstream refers to the iPhone 10
as anything other than the iPhone X and
look Apple if you're gonna do something
stupid like this
do it properly has anyone out there
tried to type iPhone 10's on their
iPhone this is a perfect example of
Apple's utter failure to keep pace with
the auto correcting and predictive
typing capabilities of Microsoft
SwiftKey and Google's G Board as for
dictation well I didn't have much more
luck there either
I mean Siri can at least do basic things
like turn on the flashlight for me now
but a li XA and Google assistant as
flawed as they are two are making Syria
look utterly incompetent these days I
mean do you guys remember when Apple was
way ahead of the game in the AI
assistant race cuz I member making
matters worse Apple's design for the
iPhone tennis you know that thing that
they are so far up their own butts about
that they literally made a three hundred
dollar book dedicated to their own
greatness it's looking dated already the
iPhone 6
look went basically unchanged for four
generations or three and a half
depending on how you count it and it
didn't really look out of style until
the third or the fourth when Samson
launched the Galaxy s8 in the si+ that
is how far ahead Apple was that recently
the iPhone 10 s already looks
unexceptional at best with how fast
display technology is moving right now
and a big part of that is the thicker
bezels on the sides and the notch on the
top the other alarming thing here is
that Apple is not only failing to lead
in terms of design trends they're
becoming a follower and a slow one at
that when it comes to wider industry
trends so think back first Apple failed
to take the lead on the trend of having
two different sizes for each flagship
generation
inexplicably even after fixing that
problem with the 6 and the 6 plus they
managed to miss participating in the
large tablet-sized category for an
entire generation of product last year
how is it that there was no iPhone 10
max with all of their resources and
employees that Apple has at their
disposal to make at most three phones
per year it really raises the question
of what were they doing
was it a strategy thing was it not quite
ready for the September keynote so just
I don't know wait a year and get it on
the next one there's a difference
between attention to detail and striving
for perfection and just being inflexible
and obstinate on that subject it turns
out that I still hate the lack of a back
button on iOS the swipe right across
gesture does work and it's better than
the old way of reaching up to the very
top left of the display but the issue is
that much like when we were still
reaching up to the top left and Apple
all of a sudden started making bigger
screen phones Apple's hardware is
getting ahead of its software again so
the back gesture requires a really clear
swipe from the edge which is hard to
execute with small hands on such a big
phone now it's far less of an issue on
the iPhone 10s than it is on the Mac's
but this is the one I spent most of my
time with primarily because it was less
jarring moving to it from the note 9 and
then also because I found the display
knotch far less distracting with the
increase in overall screen real estate
back to the knotch though one good thing
is that it still gives Apple room for
face ID which faster face ID by the way
is one of the few headline features of
this new phone but then it also serves
as yet another example of something
where Apple is letting others take bear
feature their idea and
innovate on it and even improve it so
the Oppo find X lets you swipe anywhere
on the screen rather than only at the
bottom to activate its face ID copycat
Apple doesn't allow you to do this and
instead it forces you to swipe from the
bottom which is a little tougher
ergonomically especially when you're
holding such a large and heavy phone and
often requires you to shift your hand
down I guarantee you but someone has
already dropped a tennis max because of
this now I do need to derail the rant
train a little bit here for unn in
fairness to Apple segment Android fans
have always loved pointing out how
wrecked Apple got by their favorite
device du jour having that same feature
or a better one while conveniently
ignoring that there's typically been no
single device on the Android side that
brings it all together in the way that
Apple does so to be clear I am not
recommending the find X over the iPhone
tennis or even the iPhone 10 or even the
iPhone 8 for that matter but Android
fans also never had the note 9 to point
to before now you're probably noticing
by this point in the video that I've
brought up the note 9 a lot normally I
try to limit my Galaxy Note 9 mentions
to one to two per video as much as I
love it and the reason for that is the
price the galaxy note 9 is an unfair
comparison for the vast majority of
other devices on the market
unfortunately for Apple they give up any
leeway that they might have had
otherwise when they commend the highest
price of any mainstream smartphone
though to be clear I'm glad that they're
at least offering a 512 gig on even if
it costs fifteen hundred US dollars so
then the iPhone has traditionally set
itself apart in the camera department
how's that going honestly not too bad
apples color science continues to stand
out from anyone but Google but I still
have some frustrations starting with
Apple's assumption that every power user
will use a third-party app I mean I get
that the included one is supposed to be
one touch dead simple any idiot can do
it but then if that's the case why do
you guys keep cluttering it up there
are so many modes they don't even all
fit on the screen anymore including the
incredibly unnecessary square and if
we're gonna have all these buttons why
not add some of the customization that
people are asking for most of the
complaints i've seen about this phone
are actually about the selfie camera and
the the smoothing and processing that
it's being done by it that doesn't
appear even now to be possible to turn
it off with that said though my worst
experience was actually in portrait mode
it managed to do everything from this
astonishing background removal on a
moving target down to this atrocity
where it managed to add a couple of
extra teeth to my daughters smile now
these kinds of heavy processing
techniques have long been included on
competitors devices with major ones like
samsung even enabling them by default
but one difference is that they tend to
be more transparent and they tend to
allow more configuration of the
processing so why was the response to
turn it to 11 and lock it there and why
not record an unaltered version of the
image for safety is this just the Apple
knows what's best for you mentality
hopefully by the time I post this video
Apple will have patched themselves out
of this mess
overall the camera in the normal mode
the one that I always use it in and
ignoring DXL mark and all that kind of
stuff just using it day to day to
capture the moments that means something
to me met my expectations let's move on
to a couple more Apple knows best
frustrations if you capture a screenshot
of something you can only share two apps
that Apple expects now this is better
than locking you down to first party
options but a notable omission that made
my life more inconvenient for the last
couple of weeks is the Facebook pages
manager now I'll work around the first
time that I did this was for me to save
the screenshot locally but then this is
another Apple knows best thing so what I
realized is that there's no way to
manually select your photos folder when
you want to save a screenshot you
actually just have to exit the
screenshot and then confirm that you
want to keep it and it'll automatically
go to your photos folder like I mean I
get that this is intuitive
but why remove the option from the other
way it's this kind of thing that always
has and probably always will
arrghh me about the iPhone one thing
that they did fix this time around is
notification management though so huge
gold star there it is super easy to
access group messages and emails and you
can dismiss your whole backlog in one
fell swoop just Oh beautiful awesome
there you go and there's more good news
mostly good news so I'm a lot more used
to gesture based navigation now from
playing around with it on a couple of
Android phones actually including the
one plus six and you know what gesture
navigation is fine but it's not entirely
without issue and not everyone will
necessarily prefer it then actually this
one is a criticism of both Samsung and
Apple buttons or gestures you know what
it's 2018 they're both good I would like
to have a choice and I think you guys
can both be better which I guess brings
us perfectly back to annoyances so this
whole video is actually getting kind of
exhausting I mean both go for much
longer
um all right here we go you still can't
hard press your Wi-Fi icon in order to
get to your Wi-Fi settings you have to
do it the long way the app grid still
can't have gaps forcing you to make big
piles of useless crap in the top of your
screen to put your most frequently used
stuff at the bottom where it all belongs
various oh no t9 dialing I don't
understand why that's so hard and a year
freakin later
a year after belong to the iPhone 10 the
not still gets in the way occasionally
like right here in the Twitter app where
I actually had a heck of a time
targeting the handful of pixels that I
needed to hit in order to switch to my
personal account what I can only hope
for is that maybe this is an indication
that this not design language will be
short-lived so I think that's pretty
much it so let's close this video about
with the craziest part almost everything
that I just said for the last 12 or 13
minutes or whatever has been common
knowledge to people who pay attention to
the iPhone for a year
so the iPhone tennis it's boring
it risks nothing but people bought the
crap out of the last one so I guess that
ain't broke don't fix it
enjoy your iPhones every way and while
you're at it maybe enjoy them even
better with a skin from D brand D brand
is your source for awesome vinyl skins
they're available for in laptops phones
tablets consoles controllers and more
they actually shipped over our iPhone
10s and 10's plus with this sexy new one
that I'm calling black golf ball anyway
they're useful for all kinds of things
they make your device stand out and they
also make it actually more resilient to
incidental bumps and scuffs I even
dropped the 10 s and I managed to dent
the corner here without going all the
way through the skin so I didn't end up
with a dent on my phone was super
thrilled about that their customer
service robots are easy to work with and
their products are affordable and
shipped worldwide so go check out D
brand at the link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
I hope that wasn't as tiring for you to
listen to as it was for me to say if you
just like this video you can hit that
button and hi Mr Cook if you liked it
though hit like get subscribed or maybe
consider checking out where to buy the
stuff we featured at the link in the
video description I mean to be clear
it's not bad if you like the iPhone then
I guess just buy one while you're down
there you can check out our merch store
which has cool shirts like this one and
our community forum which is totally
worth joining you know I was really
looking forward to going back to the
note 9 but then like all these phones
started showing up razor phone to the
ROG phone pixel 3 like I'm not gonna get
back to the note 9 for like two months</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
