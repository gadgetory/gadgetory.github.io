up over the last week or so is YouTube
contacted me and asked me to do a little
video for their partner blog and so you
can see this is broadcasting ourselves
on the YouTube blog so they wrote a
little blog post about how to find your
niche they they thought that my linus
tech tips channel was a good example of
a channel that has found kind of a anish
inside which you can do a certain kind
of content it's not going to appeal to
everybody I mean obviously I'm not going
to have the same kind of appeal as
someone who's showing you the latest
iPhone app or beauty tips or whatever
else is going to have a super mainstream
appeal but for the people who are
interested in videos about you know
motherboards and video cards and
overclocking and that kind of weird
stuff they wanted me to talk a little
bit about how I use the YouTube tools
that are available to me and any other
techniques that I had for making my
channel better so I was pretty excited
to be featured and I thought I'd do a
little video showing that yes I am
featured on the YouTube blog that's me
and I can even play the video and if you
check out the YouTube blog it's YouTube
dash global blogspot com and then is
right there at the top right now anyway
by the time I upload this video might
not be any more but there you go pretty
cool see whenever you like freeze frame
I always look like a gimp
I know everyone has a lot of fun with
everyone always has such a good time
finding little time spots where I look
like really really dumb it's a good one
see it's not that hard I'm like really
good at it anyway I'm not really going
anywhere with this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
