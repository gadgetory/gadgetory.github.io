Linus Tech Tips</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2010-10-15</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Ks5xe1BIbQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">this is something pretty cool that came
up over the last week or so is YouTube
contacted me and asked me to do a little
video for their partner blog and so you
can see this is broadcasting ourselves
on the YouTube blog so they wrote a
little blog post about how to find your
niche they they thought that my Linus
tech tips channel was a good example of
a channel that has found kind of a a
niche inside which you can do a certain
kind of content it's not gonna appeal to
everybody I mean obviously I'm not gonna
have the same kind of appeal as someone
who's showing you the latest iPhone app
or beauty tips or whatever else is gonna
have a super mainstream appeal but for
the people who are interested in videos
about you know motherboards and video
cards and overclocking and that kind of
weird stuff they wanted me to talk a
little bit about how I use the YouTube
tools that are available to me and any
other techniques that I had for making
my channel better so I was pretty
excited to be featured and I thought I'd
do a little video showing that yes I am
featured on the YouTube blog that's me
and I can even play the video and if you
check out the YouTube blog its YouTube -
global blog spot.com and then is right
there at the top right now anyway by the
time I upload this video it might not be
any more but there you go
pretty cool see whenever you like
freeze-frame I always look like a gimp
and I know everyone has a lot of fun
with everyone always has such a good
time finding little time spots where I
look like really really dumb it's a good
one
see it's not that hard I'm like really
good at it anyway I'm not really going
anywhere with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
