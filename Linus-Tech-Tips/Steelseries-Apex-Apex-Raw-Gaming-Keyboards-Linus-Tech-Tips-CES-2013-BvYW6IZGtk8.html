start with the apex brah
welcome to Linus tech tips at CES 2013
our trip to the show this year is
powered by Corsair maker of quality PC
components and peripherals our trusted
storage partner is Seagate technology
and our trusted networking partner is
Linksys okay guys backlit keyboard has
two layers of macro functionality so
check this out we got macro keys here
you got five we have macro keys here
you've got 12 you can actually program
those in two different ways but we've
seen this before the entire keyboard
itself is completely reprogrammable as
well so that means you've actually got
what is essentially but something like
200 functionalities that you can
implement depending on which layer of
macros you're using they've changed a
couple of the key ergonomic things about
this keyboard versus ones in the past
number one is they've added the Windows
key back this is based on feedback from
gamers remember guys SteelSeries is not
so much Flair and fluff although this is
a nice-looking product compared to the
more blocky keyboards that we've seen in
the past they actually designed for pro
gamers they've got a wide variety of
teams they sponsor so this is one of the
key changes that might cost some debate
but remember guys all the keys on the
keyboard are reprogrammable so don't
worry too much about it number two check
out this spacebar it looks kind of
stupid you know what it reminds me of it
looks kind of like the 7g which also
looks kind of stupid because it has that
huge wrist rest you know what else my
wife refuses to type on anything but a
7g if I put anything else in front of
her she will not use it because it is
incredibly comfortable things like this
come from a comfort and design
standpoint not from a visual appeal
standpoint so if you think about it in
terms of typing you don't need a wide
space bar because your hands are
positioned like this with the tips of
your thumbs on the space bar however
gamers you know I'm not gonna generalize
or anything but come on have you ever
sat up straight and games like this I
don't think so
just latch on your seat you got your
wrist down you got your thumb lying on
the space bar here that makes it easier
and faster to respond to so again good
job SteelSeries final sort of
ergonomic weirdness is these diagonal
keys here these are a carryover from the
acquisition of ideas on a number of
years back and particularly for a memo
gamers SteelSeries has gotten extremely
good feedback about it so this guy one
zone
take two layers of macros this is the
Cadillac at $99.99 remember guys these
are membrane keyboards so that's why
you're seeing these kinds of price
points with this kind of functionality
on the keyboards it has five zones zone
1 zone 2 zone 3 zone did I ever say this
one for 10 zone 5 which is the logo
right here and these lights that are on
the side cool thing about this one is
it's got four layers ten macro keys here
in addition to the ones up here and you
can actually change depending on the
layer you're in what zones are
illuminated so if you go okay I'm an MMO
player I have my you know my utility
class my attack class I have my healer
class or whatever else you can go okay
on my attack character whole thing goes
red so you know what you're doing you've
got you can make sure that all the
macros that you're gonna be hitting are
the ones that are optimized for the
character using healer class turn the
whole thing white or you can even do
things like just change one zone you can
go okay I want something more subtle so
I'm gonna change the yellow on the side
it's a sixteen point eight million
colors or something like that so you can
have whatever you want change that to a
different color on the fly I actually
missed an ergonomic change and I think
this
I think this laptop went into sleep or
some hair it is it's properly
illuminated now final ergonomic change I
didn't mention before is the macros up
here are slightly raised if I can get
you to get a good look at that these are
slightly raised this allows you to
quickly perform some kind of a combo
where you can press one of them and then
the other and fall off of it like that
it's actually it's really neat the way
they showed it to us and they gave us a
couple examples of where gamers will
actually use these there's a couple of
dots on the W which allows you to find
your way back to WASD the same way you'd
find your way to the homeroom key if you
were typing and sorry excuse me
it's got a USB hub built-in sorry DS
Larry are you focused on that there we
go
USB hub held built-in and I think that
pretty much wraps up everything I wanted
to say
about this keyboard for oh yeah okay so
you can adjust your brightness adjust
your volume you've got your media keys
over here full number pad like I said
membrane keyboard all about quickness
they're advertising this as the fastest
gaming keyboard in terms of you know
your travel distance the feedback that
the tactile feedback that's required to
press the buttons whatever you want it
whatever you want to look at it come on
over here I want to show you guys a cool
prototype this is of the apex not the
apex rock and you hit the Lights so this
one comes apart so they've got it
programmed with a variety of different
colors you can see it has a very
different look depending on what kind of
colors you're using and this is the kind
of technology that goes inside something
like this they've also updated their
software in kind of a neat way and that
is they can create heat maps where you
can set it to okay maybe you don't know
exactly what keys are optimal for you
you can have it set up heat maps while
you're gaming to show you which parts of
the keyboard you're using most on the
software on your screen so it might
you'd be able to give you tips like okay
most of the keys you user in here and
you're using are for reload still you're
not really using a that much why don't
you change itto reload save yourself
seven percent travel distance and
potentially actually make you a better
gamer I think we can all agree that in
the past especially and for the most
part that our peripherals don't make you
a better gamer inherently but
SteelSeries is trying to change that so
