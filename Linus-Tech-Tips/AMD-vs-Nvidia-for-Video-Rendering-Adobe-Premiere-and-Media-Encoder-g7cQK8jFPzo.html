anything to do with video right I mean
it spits write a name video card
they've got features to enhance video
playback in real time
they've got dedicated hardware to
accelerate video games and they're a
necessary component of any system that
needs to output video to a display at
all but what about video editing this
capability has been featured prominently
on the boxes on video cards for over a
decade but do they actually make any
bloody difference or should you just get
a beefy CPU and tackle your video
rendering that way let's find out shall
we
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more let's start
with a little bit of background on why
it is that we are doing this we make
videos and one of the most tedious and
time-consuming processes that slows us
down aside from our servers being broken
is transcoding footage for faster
performance in Adobe Premiere a process
that you can learn more about here and
encoding our finished videos using the
optimal resolutions and video codecs for
the various platforms that we publish on
including YouTube vessel and Billy Billy
comm so we discovered when we were
developing our Sena forum workflow that
GPU usage in our workstations was much
higher than we expected with certain
workloads which is funny because we
originally thought the gtx titan class
cards and our editing workstations were
basically because we can thing but
something we never really had the time
to investigate was which video cards are
best for this process we just stuck with
what nvidia had provided us back when we
did our whole room water cooling project
well now we've got an opportunity to
answer that question for the Adobe
editors out there for an unrelated
project Super Micro just sent us one of
their super server sys 4028 gr T RT
servers this freakin badass of a machine
is going to be used in a project where
we run eight gaming rigs off of a single
box with gtx 980ti amp cards from ZOTAC
more to come but in the meantime it
presented an opportunity for me and Edie
to quickly and with relative ease
without any physical access to the
machine use on raid as a virtualization
host and then use this thing as a remote
test bench so Edie could shut down a
Windows virtual machine virtually swap
the video card to any one of the ones in
here turn it back on and be ready to
rock with a new set of benchmarks this
led us exam
how a wide cross-section of different
video cards on both the AMD and NVIDIA
side of the fence behaved in our typical
video encoding tasks so the virtual
machines were set up with eight core
hyper threaded virtual processors to
represent a high-end consumer or
mid-range xeon processor and 32 gigs of
ram the tests were done using the 200
gig boot SSD as a source and as a target
and we used actual linus media group
video projects for all the scenarios
let's start by looking at the time it
takes to export a time line containing
mostly sinha form video clips in cinah
form this is how we would normally send
the project to the final export server
for processing into h.264 and the only
real conclusion that we can draw from
this is that whether you go with AMD and
therefore open CL acceleration or nvidia
and therefore CUDA acceleration for your
video workstation you're going to be
getting a very similar experience just
make sure that you do have a video card
as relying on the CPU to do this work on
its own is clearly a bad idea for the
next scenario we're looking at something
that would be more applicable to most
prosumer and professional video editors
so we're taking the 1080 piece in a form
export from the first test and
transcoding it to 4k h.264 no separate
encoding server involved our GPU usage
hovered around 30 percent and the
advantage that our video cards enjoyed
over the CPU only workflow diminished
significantly here which might lead one
to the conclusion that which graphics
card you choose doesn't matter or even
that a graphics card is really optional
if you're exporting videos directly from
your editing workstation except that our
third test using chroma keyed Sena form
4k footage and exporting to 1080p Sinha
form showed us what we were finally
looking for the scenario in which a
powerful video card demonstrates not
just better performance against pure CPU
encoding but also
video cards so the beefiest gaming GPU
in this case the gtx 980ti
in the system comes out on top with the
lesser cards performing about as much
worse as you would expect given their
overall horsepower and this would be
applicable not just to pro McKee
green screen footage but also to any
project with other effects like limit
recolor or warp stabiliser
which leads us then to a really
interesting final conclusion here
AMD versus nvidia in this case doesn't
seem to matter much
the 970 and the r9 290 which is about
equivalent to its 300 series replacement
are similar enough across the board that
I couldn't recommend one brand over the
other for editing an adobe premiere with
that said that might not be the case if
you use other tools but the takeaway
here then is that for video editing an
Adobe Premiere you should get a GPU even
if it's just a mainstream model and that
much like for gaming once you get into
the performance and enthusiast product
range you are getting diminishing
returns for the money you spend neat
speaking of which this is pretty cool
this is a brand new sponsor for us blue
