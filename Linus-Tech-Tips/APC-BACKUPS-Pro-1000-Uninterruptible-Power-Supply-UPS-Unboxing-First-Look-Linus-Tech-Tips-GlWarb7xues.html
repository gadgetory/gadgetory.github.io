at me about all the networking
especially powerline networking topics
that we've been doing so we're taking a
break and we're going to be doing a
fiesta of uninterruptible power supplies
so today we have an APC unit APC is one
of the better-known brands for UPS's our
uninterruptible power supplies they've
got a lot of information on their box
here so we're gonna go ahead and break
the seals and then see what APC has to
say about themselves for this particular
power saving battery back up here we go
so first of all it is 1000 volt em so
that is up to 600 watts of power that
can be driven off of the battery in this
unit with up to 121 minutes of runtime I
guarantee you that is not what 600 watts
but that is more of a maximum eight
outlets with a three-year warranty as
well as AVR technology this prevents
them into loss of computers and
peripherals internet modems
and wireless routers okay sure why not
photo music and video libraries yeah if
you you know plug in your your video
library appliance do it external storage
ah you can also save up to $45 see the
back panel for details
interesting annual energy savings okay
how much runtime aha here we go so 18
minutes with a graphics workstation
approximately 240 watts you know PC LCD
monitor speakers etc I would say that's
pretty conservative I can definitely
build a computer that can suck more than
240 watts from it but well we'll get to
that when we do look at that those 40
Watts 40 watts is there 121 minute quote
interesting what do we got back here
all-out best-in-class a PC peace of mind
covers your entire back ups for three
years and offers a hundred and fifty
thousand dollar lifetime equipment
protection policy cool Gigabit Ethernet
and coax surge protection good to have
for battery backup outlets with surge
protection as well as I guess for that
do not have battery backup yep
okay cold start capability allows you to
power up the unit for temporary
emergency battery power when utility
power is already out cool automatic
diagnostic testing okay ensures that you
back ups is ready when you need it fresh
button circuit breaker yep efficient
charging system recharges your back ups
in eight hours and ensures your critical
equipment remains available when the
power goes out cool easy to read LCD AM
powerchute personal edition AHS software
to help you automatically shut down if
the power turns out so you don't you
know lose your work or whatever else
building wiring fault indicator for
surge protection only outlets automatic
voltage regulation corrects incoming
utility power without utilizing the
battery very good that can help make
your equipment last longer and it's true
because even if you have pretty good
power in your house or building or
wherever you happen to be about some
included accessories here moving a coax
cable of all things um even if you have
pretty good power there is still a
chance that the slight fluctuations that
happen on a daily basis or even an
hourly basis can over time cause damage
to your computer or monitor or whatever
else that you have plugged it directly
into the wall look at that huh well
check this up comes with a little QA
test receipt things showing that it
passed all of the various test is set
battery constants and put output phase
angle capacitive load verification cool
over all past it's actually signed by
some guy whose name is apparently V
alright stop halt something connect
battery oh ok so if you don't connect
the battery that's that's bad so uh okay
how'd you do okay so the battery is we
have to pull off some kind of pull on it
why you guys give me a moment yeah so on
the reason I couldn't find anything that
slid or moved was because the sticker
was obviously covering it sticker
doesn't come off very cleanly which is a
minor complaint but you know the unbox a
lot of hardware you develop a lot of
minor complaints so basically this part
just comes off yeah whatever it comes
off and then what you do to connect the
battery is lift and pull the tabs
oh then flip it over man it's heavy LED
battery there we go
and sweet there we are okay so let's
have a look at the unit itself for
optimal power saving settings and
recommended configuration see the manual
okay good to know
and then other than that we've got a
speaker button on the front so I'm
guessing that's to silence the alarm
power as well as like a menu looking
sort of button on the back we find ah
Ethernet cable USB in serial okay I
guess it comes with Lincoln adapters
yeah neat building wiring fault as well
as surge protection only and battery
backup as well as circuit breaker push
to reset so I'm guessing this is
controlled by software in here so that's
come neat and then you got like a nice
beefy power cord coming off of it so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
of and I never actually said the model
of this man did I terrible this is the
APC back UPS Pro 1000 don't forget to
