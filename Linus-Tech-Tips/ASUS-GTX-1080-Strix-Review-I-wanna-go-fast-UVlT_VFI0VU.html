video description so the Strix 1080 from
Asus is finally here and it's rocking an
all-new aesthetic cover to their beloved
direct Cu 3 cooler design I think it
looks great and I appreciate that they
opted to go with a flat black coloring
essentially everywhere which will joking
about RGB being an overdone feature
aside compliment the addition of these
great-looking Ora enabled RGB LEDs that
support many different lighting modes
and can sync with other or enabled
devices like your a soos motherboard
keyboard mouse etc as well for
connectivity a soos decided to switch it
up a bit instead of the 10 80s standard
set up of three display ports one HDMI
connector and one DVI connector a soos
opted to ditch one of those display
ports for an additional HDMI connector
they call this solution VR friendly HDMI
ports which might sound kind of like SLI
ready edition Ram but it's not that bad
all it means is that you can have an
HDMI based VR headset connected and some
other HDMI device like a monitor or TV
without using a display port adapter for
the flat panel display something that's
required with the HTC vive on the 1000
series and video cards due to their
shockingly poor implementation of HDMI /
DisplayPort that's it moving on the
Strix has a 203 mega Hertz overclock in
OC mode over the founders Edition 733
megahertz boost clock this results in a
freakishly awesome final clock speed of
1936 megahertz which hovers in real
games between around 1920 to slightly
over 2063 megahertz thanks to GPU boost
there is an elephant in the room here
however the OC mode isn't enabled out of
the box and there's no hardware BIOS
switch or anything to turn it on ala the
6970 back in the day it has to be
enabled through GPU tweak - and a su
software utility problem number one this
utility isn't that easy to find
searching for download GPU
tweak'd - does yield in a Seuss download
page but for a horribly out-of-date
version of the software know if you want
it you'll need to scroll a little
further to the reddit discussion thread
on how to find it now they aren't hiding
it either there's a graphic about it on
the boxart and honestly it's not that
hard to track down if you just go to
your graphics card support page select
the drivers button expand what operating
system you have then expand the utility
section it's right there no big deal the
confusing part is this why if the tool
is required to reach the performance
levels advertised are they not
in-your-face about it if this is what
enables the card to be awesome
tell me I mean sure in the manual it
says to install the drivers disk but
like come on Linus basically made a meme
or throwing those things away back in
2009 we have a driver disk don't use
this download the latest off the Nvidia
website they're inherently outdated and
a soos is a pretty smart bunch I'd
imagine they know as well as I do that
the majority of people ignore them and
go straight to Nvidia or AMD z-- website
for the most up-to-date drivers why
would they ever find themselves on the a
soos support page it's annoying too
because this problem is so simple to fix
MSI has an easy to find download page
for After Burner so apparently it's not
impossible and a surprisingly low number
of people are overclocking their cards
anyways so shouldn't you be just giving
the performance to them that you're
saying the card can do anyways right out
of the box I mean the card sits at 66
degrees under load not a big deal and
you clearly have a BIOS that will run
these speeds by default there was that
whole scandal where you were sending out
cards preloaded with it to reviewers so
instead of taking that away from
reviewers FYI our card was reflashed
with a retail BIOS before testing just
give it to everyone
problem solved maybe I'm missing
something but enough of that let's move
on the performance side of things was
actually pretty groovy I experienced
performance improvements of about three
to seven fps across the board which is
rather awesome
and that's all these games are running
at 4k with everything maxed out beyond
their maximum presets that 3-2 FPS was
clawed for these were in very difficult
scenarios if I turned all the settings
down so the average FPS number was
higher the FPS said it would have
climbed would have also been higher I
don't expect many people to pick the
highest possible performance preset and
then crank further beyond that this card
is a beast and will serve you well and
all of that while sitting at about 66
degrees and nice and quietly to the card
is a beast that doesn't get too hot and
doesn't get too loud that's cool so it's
a rocking performer out of the box just
don't expect it to overclock beyond the
GPU tweak OC mode I found this rather
surprising I mean to be fair I did
manage to get the card stable at around
plus 25 megahertz but we're talking like
1% here for that level of increase
what's the point I just turned it off
and to be fair having the card hit 2063
megahertz or 2 gigahertz was impressive
enough it's just a little surprising
that there was no juice left in the tank
they really did seem to cut it close you
can either be frustrated by this or you
could take that as a good thing they did
all the work for you
let me know what your feelings are in
the comment section down below so in
conclusion despite my objections to the
way it was advertised this is an
absolutely stunning card it looks
beautiful in so many ways I love the
swap - dual HDMI ports and it is fast as
hell I might see some personal rig
potential here so stay tuned for that
today we're highlighting the k7 xx
limited edition ruby-red headphones
which is unlike any of the colors that
is currently on me of course master up
still has a bunch of other cool products
which you can check out at the link in
the video description hopefully you guys
know about mash up already though it's
the pretty simple concept where the more
people buy something on mass drop a
certain product the lower the price of
that certain product goes the product
we're showcasing today is the same spec
wise as the case of an xx headphones
that Linus reviewed last year you can
check out that video right up here the
only real difference is that
uses red accents on the ear cups and
headband and that's about it other than
the fact that it is a limited edition
drop so if you want a pair you're going
to have to act pretty fast so if you
want to check them out and grab a pair
of ruby red case of an X X headphones
head over to the link in the video
description today thanks for watching
guys if this video sucked you know what
to do but if it was awesome and you're
like wow all that stuff is weird but
it's a pretty cool graphics card
regardless hit the like button get
subscribe or check out the link in the
video description to buy the stuff that
we mentioned in this video
like the 1080 Strix at Amazon and also
link to the description is our merch
store where you can buy cool shirts and
our community forum where you can talk
about stuff like ah why don't they have
that easier to set up or bra I don't
care the cards really good and I do
manual overclocking anyway so I don't
need that thing huh I don't know check
out this video to see like the normal TT
X 1080 I filmed it in a little bit of a
weird exotic area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
