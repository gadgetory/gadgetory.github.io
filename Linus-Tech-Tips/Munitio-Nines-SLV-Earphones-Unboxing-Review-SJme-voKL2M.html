blogs the week section more than any
other case click now to learn more about
it
so when minissha reached out to me about
unboxing the nines I was a little bit
skeptical because they looked to me at
first glance like fashion earphones
which I really do just try to avoid
talking about altogether because if you
don't have anything nice to say then
don't say anything at all so I replied
to them and I basically went look if
they don't sound good I'm gonna just
tear them apart I'm just gonna give them
a terrible terrible unboxing and
overview and I'm gonna say that they
sound bad and they went no no no they
sound really good and for a hundred and
seventy dollars and headphones that are
like shaped like bullets that fit in
your ears I was like okay well they're
either all show and no go or they
legitimately sound good and they just
have like a really cool sort of fashion
sense so without further ado this is my
unboxing of the mini show nines SLV they
are titanium coated they are constructed
out of solid copper okay they have three
different sizes of what they call hollow
tips so those are the silicon caps
silicone not silicon silicon caps that
go on top of them to fit in your ears
and they really do look like the
housings of nine millimeter rounds
sticking out of your ears which is
extremely cool they're available in a
variety of colors which you can check
out on their website and I mean okay
okay so here there's a couple things so
because they're constructed from copper
they are quite heavy so they actually
come with two ear clips that look a
little something like that you've also
got a little clip for the wire that's
included in there nice little carry bag
which is actually quite stylish got a
nice little orange accent in there and
then there's another pouch for putting
presumably the actual headphones
themselves and it closes magnetically I
like that good design well look at the
loop on it as well alright okay I'm down
for that
we've got ammunition card that makes you
feel premium as well as a manual
warranty they have a two year warranty
next up we've got oh yes this is it the
earphones themselves so they are made
for iPod made for iPad and iPhone which
means that the inline
trolls here which are able to control
voice as well as volume up and down and
track skipping by clicking multiple
times that's only gonna work on iOS
devices overall the construction of them
feels very solid but this is what you'd
expect from sort of fashion headphones
as well 24 karat gold plating on the
connector which will only matter if you
unplug and pull them in like a billion
times
nice knurled finish on this connector
right here though like that lots of grip
on it and then there nice little
branding there they've got Kevlar
reinforced braided cable which is only
important if you have cats that tend to
chew up here earphones which some of us
do so I'm not even I'm not even gonna
make fun of them for that so yeah we put
Kevlar on it yeah good that's awesome
thank you for that and then finally how
those really do have some heft to them
finally the earphones themselves when we
pull off their hollow point silicon tip
I love that branding we find the nine
millimeter
rare earth mule Die Mia magnet drivers
if something to bear in mind about these
headphones is even though they have that
made for iPod branding there are fairly
high impedance so these are 32 ohm
impedance earphones which when you
consider that something like a
sennheiser momentum on ears are running
at 18 ohms of impedance you kind of go
oh wow what's going on here so you may
want to look into something like a
portable headphone amplifier or you may
find that they sound great to you out of
the box one of the advantages of higher
impedance headphones is that they can
help with bass roll-off as well as
roll-off on the higher end giving you a
flatter more well a more flat sounding
sound for lack of a better way of
putting that so without further ado
we're gonna have to listen to these and
let you guys know what we think so now
that Brandon and I have had a chance to
spend some time really playing around
with these I have a few things to point
out so number one is I was terrified
when I looked at the back of the package
and I was like oh no they deliver
unmatched sound purity okay that sounds
okay so far tight fun during distortion
free bass okay when the first thing they
talk about is the bass that's that's
scary because a lot of the time that
means yeah we couldn't figure
how to optimize the drivers and how to
optimize the output so we're just gonna
be like yeah it's got lots of bass and
it's loud and yeah put big drivers on it
that that is not that is not a good
audio experience but then they kind of
go crystal clear mids soothing smooth
the highs accurate and enveloping sound
that is uniquely me missio and they're
actually right so the first thing I
noticed about them is that even though
they look like fashion earphones and
even though they are branded like
fashion earphones they're like bullets
and stuff the second I plugged them into
my HTC One so I'm using Apollo now which
dramatically improves the sound output
compared to even power amp which has a
great reputation
Apollo is much better anyway I'm using a
polynomial and I was like oh well they
have a very flat sounding the sound
signature they don't have like this
pumped up bass that you get so often
with headphones and earphones these days
so I kind of want oh well I wonder if
they're even capable of really pumping
out the bass so then I fire it up power
amp which I'm really not that big of a
fan of anymore but it does have a
built-in EQ and lo and behold really
punchy tight bass I'm impressed
I'm really impressed if I had one
complaint about them it will okay if I
have like I gotta list all my complaints
about them because I do have a few
complaints number one is that these ear
clips are not really very useful for me
they don't even sit on my ear once you
put the once you put the earphone into
it and they're made out of a hard
plastic so I really just didn't find
them that useful but the good news is in
spite of their weight I really didn't
have trouble keeping them in with the
smallest tips and they come with three
different sizes of tips
my next complaint is that there is a
little bit of sibling that is at the
very high end when high frequency sounds
can be a little bit harsh sounding to
your ears the way that you can
compensate for that though if you do
have a software EQ in your media player
is that you can take the very very high
frequency and turn it down a little bit
with that said pretty much anything
under several hundreds of dollars you're
going to experience a noticeable amount
of that so it's just a matter of your
tolerance level and it was really only
detectable for me at very high volume
levels speaking of volume levels I was
able to drive these up to higher than
comfortable I didn't actually make
the maximum volume on my HTC one so I
wouldn't worry too much about the 32 ohm
impedance unless you have extremely weak
output on your phone or mp3 player or
otherwise and then the last thing that I
wanted to talk about is the noise
isolation they don't have the best noise
isolation ever but it's weird because
you end up in sort of the situation
where I can put these in and if I'm not
listening to anything I can I can hear
myself quite clearly I can hear my
surroundings very clearly brandon was
able to hear the embarrassing music I
was listening to very clearly but when
I'm listening to them they have a more
closed sound to them I don't know if
it's the metal construction or if it's
something else about the engineering of
these earphones but the sound signature
sounds more closed but they are actually
not very noise isolating compared to the
ones that I use more regularly which are
the SteelSeries flux in your prose where
I'm using comply tips so maybe it's not
really an apples-to-apples comparison
and Brandon's frame of reference is what
are those again monster turbine pro so
we're talking earbuds that retail for
like four hundred dollars as opposed to
these ones with one hundred and seventy
dollar price points so I think at the
end of it all the conclusion that we
were both able to agree on is for a
hundred and seventy dollars if you want
something that sounds good and it
doesn't look like garbage you know what
not a bad bet so color me surprised and
impress the munition inés are not just
fashion earphones
