today this laptop was already open when
I got it so we're gonna do a Reebok cing
so let's start with everything about it
because that's what we have in front of
us this is the assuit UL 30 a this is
from their thin and light series so I
guess why don't we just look at how thin
and light it is now the first thing that
I noticed about it is that while it is
very thin impressively thin it's not
actually that light a soos has made some
compromises on this notebook in order to
deliver the all-day computing experience
so this notebook actually has an 8 cell
battery in it so besides the fairly
decent spec you've got a Core 2 Duo
su 7,300 13.3 inch screen 3 gigs of ram
as well as a 250 gig hard drive
wireless-n all of that good stuff you
have also got considerable battery life
to go along with it that's great another
way that they've achieved this long
battery life on their thin and light
series of notebooks is by using a green
LED panel so that's going to reduce your
power consumption a little bit and it's
also going to give you a better quality
screen so Zeus talks about a couple
other things on the front of their box
here first thing is they've got HD
vision sticker here ok then they have
Centrino inside sticker over here then
they have that it has ddr3 up here
iSchool palm rest that's kind of
interesting so what they're basically
saying is that this part of the notebook
where you actually rest your hands when
you're typing doesn't get that hot
because that's a big problem that I've
run into with notebooks in the past is
that it'll have like some kind of hot
component sort of right around here and
so whenever you're typing your palm
starts to get sweaty and it gets kind of
gross it's not not that great ok so let
me see ESU's is also saying that they've
got health assurance with this notebook
ultra low electromagnetic interference
interesting ok so why don't we have a
look at the keyboard like most premium
notebooks these days it's using a
chiclet style keyboard which while I'm
not the biggest fan of everyone in there
dog seems to seems to like these so Who
am I to judge they've got a very very
sensible layout to it here you can see
that all of the keys are in there
correct and full-sized locations
for easy access of someone with
relatively small hands I hate seeing a
half-length backspace key because I
can't I can't hit it over there and
actually keep my hands on the keys so
they've got nothing unusual or stupid on
there and why don't we have a look at
the screen itself so as we mentioned
before it is a 13.3 inch screen I don't
actually have wireless but I'm booted up
into a Seuss's Express gate technology
so that is pretty much a way of just
getting right into whatever it is you
need to do so we can want the web
browser and you don't actually have to
boot into Windows 7 Professional which
comes pre-loaded on this notebook so
it's kind of cool if you have your
wireless set up then it'll actually work
but it's a little Linux based thing so
you can use Skype chat online games
music web I've never actually used
express gate before even though I've had
lots of products that have featured it
so yeah this is the first time I've seen
it interesting okay why don't we have a
look at what this notebook has in terms
of connectivity so I'm gonna go ahead
and close it on the cameraman there on
the top first of all we've got garlic
kind of a brushed aluminum sort of
finish and I took off a little sticker
thing you've got a silver sort of an
embedded Asus logo that looks really
really sharp so this is what you'll look
what it'll look like when you're using
it and people are looking at you see
looks all stylish and thin very nice
okay so let's go and have a look at what
we've got in terms of connectivity first
of all you've got an air vent here so
the fan is exceptionally quiet I don't
think that's realistically gonna bother
anybody next you've got VGA more
importantly you've got HDMI video out
along with one USB port on this side
then moving around to the front you've
got a couple of what appear to be either
speakers or air vents hold on give me a
second here yeah those are gonna be
speakers up on the front here then
around on the other side we've got an SD
card reader
you've got your headphone jack
microphone jack two more USB ports
Gigabit Ethernet and a power in so the
conductivity is actually a lot like a
netbook in that you've got sort of three
USB ports your network your sound and
that's mostly it now one thing that
have at it obviously is the HDMI port
and that's huge
but what you've noticed already
hopefully is missing is an optical drive
so you will need to use an external
optical drive if you want to use any
sort of DVD or CD media with this
particular notebook now I'm gonna go
ahead and turn it off oh the cameraman
is looking at the multi-touch touchpad
good job cameraman so that's a
multi-touch touchpad so you can use
gestures it's looks like up to three
fingers which is pretty cool okay so why
don't we take the battery out because
when you're holding this notebook you
can easily tell that by far the heaviest
part of it is this side right here so as
seuss in order to achieve the 12 hour
battery life that they've got with this
notebook has designed the battery to be
a huge amount of the actual size of the
notebook so let me see how many watt
hours so this is a 5,600 milliamp hour
battery rated at 15 volts if that
matters to anybody and okay let me see
what do we have on the bottom here so on
the bottom you've got easy access panels
to access the hard drive or the RAM and
Wireless upgrade module so you can see
the two sodium's that are installed
right here and I'm gonna go ahead and
assume the wireless is over there
somewhere in here is the hard drive so
now we can actually get along to the
accessories included with this laptop so
I'm not gonna bother putting it back
stuff like oh actually this is
interesting
so those who's talks about their global
warranty so 360 degree notebook service
so you got a two-year global warranty
that means you buy it in Canada you move
to Europe you're still covered a lot of
companies won't do that two-way
overnight shipping for your for your 360
degree notebook service and then it also
includes if you register within 60 days
of buying your notebook one year of
accidental damage warranty which covers
drops fire spills and power surges
that's pretty awesome to be including
without any additional purchase on on
their notebooks some and
cardboard things back on the laptop
itself here if I could make them fit
really well why don't we just open up
the box which I appear to have lost
there it is okay so let's see what we
find inside here I'm going to go ahead
and guess that yes this is a power
adapter so the power adapter is very
very small so since this is using
Intel's lowest power CPUs other than the
atom you're only using a 2.1 amp power
adapter so this thing is just just tiny
very convenient to carry around because
the last thing I want to see when I buy
a low-power
thin and late notebook is a huge bulky
power brick that I have to carry around
with it that's just stupid so you got a
power cable to plug into your power
brick and then what else do we have
inside here you've got a Windows 7
recovery media ok so they're not using a
recovery partition but they're in
actually including a DVD with 64-bit
windows 7 that's pretty nice and then
they've got some applications that you
can use a sous DVD power to go media
show then you have drivers and utilities
on yet another disc and finally a
recovery DVD ROM so no I'm not sure
which one of these is the recovery DVD
and which one of them is the recovery
DVD but this one's sealed so maybe this
is Windows 7 to XP alternative program
oh I see so this must be Windows XP
there you go so this maybe was back when
they were doing the windows 7 downgrade
or maybe they're still doing it I don't
know okay next we have uncompromising
performance when it less than one inch
ultra slim so this is a little sticker
that was on the screen when this was new
and sealed then we have a notebook
warranty card which is has the
registration information that you can
cut out and send to a sous to get your
one year of accidental damage warranty
Express gate manual so that tells you
how to use that software that I couldn't
figure out how to use right off the bat
there so it boots up in only a couple
seconds and then you can do all of this
stuff so you can pause that if you
want to read it I'm not gonna read it
out okay next we've got a cable tie so
you can use that to manage the the
cables for your plugs okay and then last
but not least you have an assist users
manual and the user's manual includes
useful things like a picture of a
notebook as well as some safety
precautions and how to plug in your
notebook PC okay
oh it also it shows you some of the
gestures that you can use for your
multi-touch interface that's pretty nice
okay well thank you for checking out my
unboxing today and thank you for
