my writers actually came up with a
really special challenge for us they
have given us each a PC and a Mac to
determine once and for all which one is
truly the easiest to use but but with a
twist why am I on the PC side my name is
over here you get the PC and I get the
Mac what were they thinking here we go
hey where's a pen why do I get the
gummed up mouse pad look at this thing
it's this guy that's like I want to
believe these are food stains Wow ah
we've got we've got pens so in these
envelopes are our challenges I believe
it is 10 tasks that we have to complete
using let's just say our non-preferred
platform yeah I mean it's not like I've
never used Windows I basically open up
fortnight I'll open up overwatch I'll
open up minecraft or Diablo and then I
close them and I go on my merry way so I
wish you luck you too today's video is
brought to you by savage jerky savage
turkey is made with the best ingredients
I recommend the maple buffalo bacon
flavor how I really do
use code LTT and save 10% at the link
below
so I mean this isn't one of the
challenges so can you coach me through
this do I did the green one are the hell
was that one yellow one yes and it'll
just go away I don't have to look at it
anymore
you're going I don't think I'm gonna win
this challenge I mean I don't know what
these challenges are I mean honestly I
just open them and see I mean look at
this mouse okay so recently I found out
that you know people aren't really a big
fan of the Magic Mouse you found this
out recently have you ever googled lady
but I love it especially for final cut
like I use that to scrub through my
timeline I use it for everything I even
travel with one what the only thing that
I don't like is that you have to turn
how have they not fixed that yet I don't
know that was like immediately a meme
it's a problem knowing Apple they would
have some kind of over engineered
solution like a like an levitating thing
you put it on so that you can you can
plug your thing but they haven't even
done that I would buy it I would buy it
I would probably buy five did someone
like these two sealed envelopes anyway I
don't know just these are just brought
them gloves oh wow there's something you
know there is something
oh there's a USB key this is so
elaborate look at this I thought you
said there were ten here's a team is
this a race or real not to Google things
no this is like a really scary versus
really really stressful is okay oh I'm
sweating
wait are we starting now okay go I guess
okay okay oh gosh I hate Safari Safari
is a piece of garbage I'm just a slack
desktop no oh oh crap I'm doing it wrong
already there's a there's a thing
there's the absolutely no that doesn't
count I was just gonna download the app
I don't oh wait a mess okay so I just
get it it says download install slack
desktop from the web from the web oh so
wait a minute but I do I need an Apple
password just to install an app okay I'm
installing slack now I don't know where
it's going this launch pad has a thing
here okay well I guess I'll how do i
right-click hold on I think you have to
turn on right-click I remember this must
be on this I shut it off oh my god wait
no hinge I wanted to give you a hit to
move a file from a flash drive to the
desktop see now I do know that the USB
drives are on the back of the island
yeah because it's at all in life that we
had that to title document Oh rat that
why did a spotlight search for document
opened the keyboard options now windows
search not great
spotlight generally better that was not
a good showing not a good look for it
hey no cheating
I find that you're using WordPad isn't
gonna help me sheets is that what no
it's not called sheets
Oh keynote yeah yeah essentials oh my
why can't you click essentials and have
it show you other essentials how is that
page
wait isn't it Artie why do I have to
install that see you oh it's blue hurt I
didn't say anything against it it was
already installed on my computer guys
that not install I didn't read my
directions I have to say this
do you guys print PDFs or no because I'm
not a thing do you guys not do that
like you go into print and you can click
Oh print as PDF and it prints it out of
the PDF on do you guys not do that
okay maybe this
welcome to pages no no just open create
a document thank you another form okay
add a title you a PDF option insert what
you see by title do you mean like a
header okay but there's no option to say
this as a PDF sort of page number how do
you just do a header rich text like
there's a look there's a header control
thing you can control how big it is okay
there's no option to save this as a PDF
I'm very upset creating new sections
let's do you know how easy it is to grab
when you click text it creates a text
box
do you give me audience to make a PDF on
a Mac super easy no that in word you can
just right click on text and you can
change all the properties you want about
it
this is see the problem is not that you
can't enable right click on a Mac you
can it's just it's not designed for it
so nothing useful happens when you right
click
that's my Mac people don't think that
right click is important we control
click control freaks
I can probably make a PDF I hate but not
word I'm looking at I can't save this is
a PDF I am typing a paragraph right now
I'm so mad wonderful experience
using the Macintosh that's right I'm
gonna call it a Macintosh I'm gonna do
that on purpose
how is picture not under insert right my
friend Linus three names right click
green it I just am really upset that
this well export as a stupid PDF like
I'm stuck on this James can suck it but
I did there we go I renamed it $85 for
PDF Expert PDF to word free has one star
though and that's from the same company
this is unfair it's not letting me save
this as a PDF I'm not a head of you I
know we're just to be very clear the
same step do you know how to do yes
really
of course yeah but it's not am i doing
the wrong thing why is it not here
shouldn't be able to print it to file
right
right a mice this is so ridiculous is
there's no option export to PDF there's
not an option to do it on here yeah baby
I'm even gonna set it to best image
quality James can suck it to the desktop
BAM
PDF baby yeah but like you can't keep
that out serious can it can I see this
first hold on no no no let me let me see
this for a second here I would throw my
computer across the room and say I don't
need a freaking PDF at that point we
might have to let this one slide how is
this not working I am asking myself the
same thing but how was your how was your
PDF experience over there
well eventually once I figured out how
to use it it was relatively fine hmm
okay well why don't we just give Justine
a pass on that one yeah okay okay so now
we have to download a picture of
ourselves from the web I am actually
sweating me too okay oh boy what picture
will we choose um how about a picture of
me holding up my book in front of a Mac
wait we need to save the screenshot
screenshot oh oh you're in trouble
you're in trouble
[Laughter]
probably like it's probably like command
option some stupid demented wait did I
just get this hold on
hey technically that's a screenshot is
it wait what did you do what did you put
on P no that's that's the screenshot
save as PDF what did you do that's a
screenshot I'm counting it safe damn
screenshot it's a oh it's 14 pages
that's definitely not a stream that's a
screen that is not a screenshot is a
screen that is a screen you're you're
printing from a program so oh that's not
a screenshot and that's not the right
speed watch a man die oh yes that is
pretty sure that's not a screen shot
look at it
be printed in an application he printed
out all the processes into a PDF not a
screen shot that is not a screen shot oh
you're only able to do this because of
the one particular thing I asked to just
Greenshaw and if I had asked you to
screenshot something else that wouldn't
work would not have worked so no takers
branch out of your current CP is that my
current CPU usage oh my good but that's
not that's not fair though put your
document while you're in there for stop
the text editor I'm counting it you know
what we'll let the viewers be the judge
we will it was that a screenshot yea or
nay definitely was not guys don't let
him don't let him lie to you stop in the
text editor program what is it even
called okay put your compressed folder
on the flash drive whoo and of course it
made a copy of it because it's garbage
I'm shutting down my computer oh wait
where's the truck me stop my recording
first because it's not a trashcan
anymore it's an eject thing you wish you
leased a document from the machine hold
on trash uninstall delete slack hold on
a second I shut down instead of
restarted oh goodness I can still win
this how do I find stuff that is
installed I'll just search for it slack
holy crap the thing next to it doesn't
give you the option to delete it why
does it not give you the option to
delete it
what is this right-click garbage garbage
garbage no yes yes garbage hold on
are you done yes damn it it's okay I got
stuck on a stupid PDF I got this was
rigged this was absolutely rigged turn
off the computer well technically my
computer restarted so we may still wait
but now I'm gonna bash it down OBS is
active wait Oh
yes stop recording I cancelled eggs no
in so many so many way this was so much
harder than I was expecting this is the
simplest thing I could not make a PDF
and to be fair I was rigged the PDF was
rigged in fairness to you as far as I
know that should have worked
it should've so where did you get hung
up at like what was your difficult task
I couldn't figure out how to add a
header to my document okay you know what
we should fire the machines back up
let's do it okay it's chat about let's
try it about some things that went wrong
I don't know if I was doing this
properly okay what to take a screenshot
yeah I print I printed the screen yeah
and then I went into paint yeah yeah
this is that what people still do no ok
now you use snipping tool is that a
built-in thing yeah and then you just
click new and then you just drag it
around whatever you want
oh really yeah so if you want the whole
screen sure a snipping tool and then you
can highlight or you can like draw on it
or whatever and then you can send it to
someone or save it or whatever I'm still
stuck in like 10 15 years ago using
paint oh I use actually share X it's a
third-party program and what it does is
you can create all kinds of different
screen capture hotkeys and then you can
have it say file upload a mature copy to
clipboard or you can upload any other
editors you want for you can not you can
skip any of those definitely I think a
selection like that for just apples may
for even scroll like I'm along I think
you heard the whole thing
but where are you trying to add a header
know where you even supposed to add a
header I think he said out of title and
I asked him I mean a header and he's
like yeah but like so he screwed me too
I've got a heading for you out the door
I can't believe I just lost that I just
gave leave how long it took us to figure
out how to print a PDF you know there
were no winners today really we're there
no not really I feel very defeated well
thank you DG no read yeah I never want
to do this again except you already
suggested Final Cut vs premier oh wow
which would actually be amazing could be
me would have to be one of my editors
