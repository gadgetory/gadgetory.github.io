brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital hey guys we're here at
mirada checking out a project by
elliptic labs this is really interesting
we've recently talked on the wine show
about how we don't like touching screens
in laptops and stuff because it's just
kind of gross you don't want all those
finger marks on your screen and then you
have to clean it all the time and it it
becomes taxing where it really doesn't
need to be and then touch integration
with a laptop kind of isn't the greatest
even though it's kind of cool so you can
have in windows 8 and you can slide in a
slide in other applications but then
it's it's it's weird because you have to
touch your screen on this one you can go
as as closer as far away as you want
with a depth that you can set so if you
start freaking out over here it's not
going to do anything but the second he
gets closer to the screen he can
actually pan up and down which is nice
because if your mom comes over whatever
and gives you dinner when you've been
gaming for 14 hours when you turn to
grab the plate you're not going to
scroll the screen or do anything because
the depth is not going to pick it up you
can see as he pulls away it knows
exactly where he is so as he pulls away
the doc gets really big as he gets close
to the doc it's really small it tracks
them all over place you can see the data
in the top left of where exactly he is
to like I think three decimal two
decimal points which is pretty
impressive this is new interaction with
computers it's a big thing I've seen at
CES this year wellness TVs phone cases
and new interaction with computers and
this is a really interesting one because
I really don't like touching screens
despite them being called touch screens
