DNA and Intel 730 series SSD is an
amazing choice for gamers and
performance enthusiasts welcome to our
Mac Pro killer hackintosh guide the goal
here was to build a video editing or
general content creation machine that
runs OS 10 mavericks and delivers
similar raw performance and low noise
operation to a premium 8 core mac pro
but at a much lower price so let's open
this right off the bat with the answer
to the big question why would you want
to build a hackintosh we all know at
least the folks who are somewhat paying
attention know that spec 4 spec hardware
for hardware if you actually tried to
build the exact same thing Apple PCs are
fairly priced competitive these days
with an equivalent PC so why not just
buy an apple well a couple of reasons
number one is to save money as I just
mentioned like four seconds ago buying
the same hardware Apple is using to
build a PC will usually yield a similar
pricing but the trick is that Apple's
Hardware choices are not always the best
bang for the buck and by choosing
completely different hardware similar
performance can sometimes be achieved
for a much cheaper especially if you're
willing to get into a little
overclocking number two is that Apple
doesn't always design their hardware
with upgrade ability in mind and by
adding extra PCI Express cards and
better Hardware over time the life of a
system can be significantly extended
something you can't do with ram solder
to your motherboard or a complete
absence of internal storage and PCI
Express expansion number three is that
you might just be a tinkerer who also
appreciates OS 10 and just plain old
wants to do it in which case rock on
brother
now that's not to say that hack and
toshing doesn't come with challenges you
need to carefully select your Hardware
ahead of time like seriously carefully
sometimes even video card firmware
revisions or motherboard BIOS updates
can cause problems and even then while
support for stuff like Wireless and on
sound is much better now than it was in
the early days you might still not be
able to get certain stuff like advanced
CPU power management features working
that last bit is actually an issue we're
still having on this particular machine
but I ve hackintosh Inge is still in
early stages and there are actually
other boards it works on so I'd be
surprised if that last issue doesn't get
resolved for our rig at some point here
so let's walk through the rationale of
our parts choices we went with a six
core Core i7 49 30 K this chip at stock
speeds is about equivalent to the six
cores neon that's available for the Mac
Pro Xeon advantages include support for
ECC registered memory dims an essential
feature on servers and suggested on
workstations but something that many
folks can live without and that's
theoretically tighter quality control
but frankly anything that says Intel on
the box I could say tighter QC and I
would believe it anyway for RAM we went
with the highest performance most
compatible just best 64 gig ddr3 24
hundred megahertz kit that we could find
g.skill ripjaws z 8x8 kit even though we
knew we'd end up running it at 1866 or
2133 on this particular board running it
below spec gives us peace of mind that
we're not even pushing the rated limits
of it so you should be in pretty good
shape there our motherboard is a
gigabyte x79 up4 gigabyte boards are
famous for being relatively easy to get
going in hacking Tosh's and this one
ended up being fairly straightforward
other than the power management thing
that's still being worked on our video
card is a gtx 780 reference card and we
chose it for its excellent compute
performance and great acoustics remember
that goal of this system you're going to
want to avoid non-reference cards for
the most part unless you can find
evidence that they are specifically
supported or that they can at least be
successfully flashed with the bios of a
card that does work and GPU support is
something that changes frequently so
make sure to double check before
clicking that buy button others silence
optimized components in the system
include our a x86 TI power supply that
only runs the fan under medium to heavy
system load our n hu 12s CPU cooler from
Noctua
our n FF 12 case fans also from Noctua
and our
and the Xth 440 case with this tower cpu
cooling setup we avoid needing the loud
fans that come with our RAM to keep them
cool and by switching all the case fans
to under bolted not to a fans from the
aged 440 we are able to achieve near
silence for our system just like the Mac
Pro finally the SSD was actually a
component that I watch on a fair bit but
I ended up going with a Samsung 840 Evo
500 gig because I wanted capacity enough
for some growing rooms so it's not like
you download a couple videos and photos
off the internet and boom you drives
full but I actually didn't care that
much about performance beyond making
sure I wasn't using magnetic media for
my boot drive this choice was based on
my assumption that serious content
creators are not doing real work on an
SSD no not even a one terabyte one in
spite of Apple's marketing about how
fast it is and how great it is for
working on 4k video because it's just
not enough space anyway and whether
those professionals want to expand the
internal storage of the machine with a
raid array or build an as they are gonna
be keeping their massive images in RAW
4k footage somewhere else anyway so the
SSD just needs to be fast enough to run
the OS and applications so with that in
my head even though there are tons of
other storage options available
especially because this system actually
has storage options I chose an SSD with
middling performance decent background
garbage collection and excellent price
to performance to capacity ratio so
without further ado get yourselves a Mac
because you'll need one to create your
bootable media as well as a couple of
USB drives one for the actual OS
installation and one for like drivers
and stuff just to have that handy and
I'm gonna hand off to Luke to show you
how to install OS 10 mavericks on a PC
first you're going to want to download
oh s X Mavericks this will come from the
Apple website and can only be downloaded
on a Mac next you're going to want to
download my hack this should be done on
the same computer that you downloaded OS
X on now go into your downloads folder
and open the my hack dmg accept the
terms and can
else it won't work go to your
Applications folder and drag and drop
the icon that's on the desktop for my
hack into the Applications folder then
double click the my hack symbol in the
application window select open on the
pop-up type in your password select
create OS X installer let it know which
version of OS X you want to install
select the drive you want to install it
on that should be a flash drive and just
tell it to scan your system to find OS X
considering you downloaded it earlier
it'll find it right away and then just
click OK now you've got quite a wait a
head of you this will take a little
while adjust the head top
near the end of the my hack installation
process it'll ask you if you want to
patch the installer for MBR support the
answer that is no you should be
installing your OS X on a GUI d
partition type and you won't need the
MBR support because of that next you
want to download your motherboards dmg
directly off of rampage devs website you
can do that by going to the x79 dmg
downloads page and selecting the
manufacturer for your motherboard once
you're there you're going to scroll down
and select the actual model of your
motherboard for this example we're using
AGA x79 up4 so we'll download that dmg
right now next you're going to want to
take that dmg you just download it and
move it to a flash drive for later use
next you're going on a boot onto that
flash drive that you were just setting
up under startup volume you're going to
want to select my hack install disc and
then for boot Flags if you're running
LGA 2011 or LGA 1366 you're in around -
V space CPU is equal one space NPC I
equals 0 X 2000 if you're running LGA
1150 or LM 55 your own ax 1 - v NPC I
equals 0 X 2000 no need for that CPU is
equal 1 flag you will also need unique
parameters depending on what graphics
card you have so if you have an AMD 6800
series card or an nvidia gtx 500 series
card or nvidia 610 or 650 TI you will
need to use the parameter graphics
enabler equal yes if you have an AMD
7000 series + card or an nvidia gtx 660
+ or an nvidia gtx 760 + you'll need to
use the graphics enabler equals no flag
once the beachball finally stops
spinning you're going to select your
preferred language
and then go to the utilities tab Disk
Utility select the hard drive or SSD
that you want to install a Mac OS X onto
for format you're going to use Mac OS
extended journaled name it whatever you
want I named it Mac Drive and then click
erase once it's done erasing you can
simply close this window and then click
continue agree to the terms and
conditions so you can actually do
anything select that drive that we just
set up and click install near the end of
your OSX Mavericks install my hack will
pop up asking you about extra folders
completely ignore this pop-up do not
click on it do not click on anything
just hard restart the computer if you
run into a halt on system uptime in
nanoseconds in verbose mode I would
recommend going into your BIOS and
resetting to defaults the only time I
actually ran into this problem was when
I was overclocking but as some of you
might be running this setup on a system
that you've had before which might be
overclocked this is just a heads up this
also applies later in the video when we
talk about overclocking all right now
that we've done the initial install
we're ready to actually boot onto the
drive so you're going to want to select
the start up volume as your Mac Drive
and then enter the same parameter flags
as you did when you first use the
installation disk to do the initial
setup all right now you can relax a
little bit you're in the easy mode part
now you just got to set up your user
account and then you're good to go after
that you're gonna want to select my
computer does not connect to the
internet because you have no drivers
right now so it's not gonna connect to
the internet anyways other than that
everything is pretty much up to you
until we get into the operating system
now you're gonna want to grab that flash
drive we put the dmg on and extract the
dmg next you're gonna want to go into
files tools and then around text helper
b7 going back to your motherboard
manufacturer and then your then the text
folder inside of there you're gonna want
to grab all the texts that are there
move them to the text helper
zero-point-seven application type in
your password and then just click easy
install
ignore the reboot instruction you do not
want to reboot at this point this error
message is fine it's saying that it's
from an unidentified developer but it's
loading anyway so it's okay don't worry
about it again just ignore the reboot
next you're going to want to go into
your chameleon folder once inside you're
going to want to drag the extra folder
into the Macintosh HD shortcut and click
authenticate and then type in your
password next are going to want to go
into the Files directory and then into
your motherboard manufacturers folder
after that you'll go into the model
number of your motherboard into the SSD
T folder and then into the respective
manufacturer of your graphics cards
folder then you have to open up your
Macintosh HD link that we opened earlier
and then go into that extras folder that
you dragged into there previously and
move the SSD T file into that extra
folder now we get to install the boot
loader so you're gonna want to go into
the flash drive that you use to install
your operating system and then open the
myhacc shortcut once that's open you
should type in your password select
Install chameleon you're gonna want to
install it to root which is just the
forward slash and it should be done very
quickly now that you've installed the
majority of your drivers and you have
your bootloader installed you can
actually restart your system you don't
have to boot it up with any parameters
you just have to make sure that you
select your Mac Drive and you boot there
but I do recommend using verbose mode
also known as dash V in the parameter
sector so that you can actually see
everything that's going on and see what
its halting on if it fails to boot now
you're going to want to identify what
audio patch you need you can do this by
going to your motherboards manufacturers
website go into the specifications and
checking out the audio codec that it
uses for us it is a real tech alc 892
codec next we're going to use the handy
dandy dmg that we downloaded earlier to
install the other drivers although this
time we're going to go into files and
then the manufacturer of our
motherboards folder and then it took hex
again but instead of using the qex will
use the Safari download links in this
case all we need is a LC 892 although I
do download all of them once they're
downloaded you're just going to want to
go into the folder of the one that lines
up with the codec that your motherboard
use it so in this case again al
eight nine - there are many command
files within this patch folder you're
gonna have to find the one who's last
numerix within the name line up with the
last numerix in the codec that your
motherboard uses so in this case nine to
running this command file Security's
gonna freak out you're gonna have to
allow it to run the script you can do
that by going to the system preferences
security and privacy and clicking open
anyway once the command window opens up
type your password and press enter and
then you're good to go you'll need a
restart at this point for audio to
actually start working and you can
restart now as you've installed your
bootloader and all your other drivers
overclocking this platform is pretty
standard fare and with minimal / volting
and without pushing it too hard we were
able to get the CPU to 4.2 gigahertz and
the memory to 1866 megahertz so with all
that fun stuff out of the way it's time
to find out how the machine actually
stacks up to a real Mac Pro so since
neither leek nor I are really Mac guys
and we don't even know like what are the
benchmarks of choice for for Apple folks
we decided to just you know find out
another Mac Pro review in this case we
went with mkbhd s video review of his 8
core Mac Pro and run the same suite of
benchmarks and Marcus was even kind
enough to allow us to include his
results in our review for easy
comparison so there you go guys we've
had these over laying here this gives
you some idea of how closely our
hackintosh performs to an 8 core Mac Pro
in spite of the dramatic difference in
price between our configuration and
Marcus's but with the raw performance
comparison between our admittedly
overclocked consumer-grade hackintosh
and Marcus Brown these 8 core Mac Pro
out of the way I want to be the first to
point out that this is not an apples to
apples comparison so to speak our
machine is desktop great it's consumer
grade and the Mac Pro is workstation
grade hardware but the beauty of a
hackintosh
is that we can choose whether or not to
spend the extra money that workstation
grade hardware costs to make the machine
more MacPro like one big difference is
the CPU we saved a ton of money going
with a core i7 but Xeon chips will
actually run in a variety of ATX
motherboards we could have bought one of
those and ECC memory can then be used
with them if we thought that that was
necessary for this config another big
difference is the GPUs but other than
for CAD or serious 3d rendering I would
argue that a workstation grade GPU is a
luxury not a necessity and anyway you
could I once again put a Quadro in the
hackintosh if you really felt like it
one more thing is that our SSD solution
I mentioned this before I'm gonna
mention it again is really nothing
special compared to Apple's PCI Express
solution but as we saw it didn't affect
our benchmarks much anyway since most
things really aren't that i/o limited
and we could always chuck a few in there
and raid if we felt like it but like I
said before an actual content creation
Pro will likely be editing off a storage
array connected via 10 Gigabit Ethernet
USB 3 or Thunderbolt anyway which is a
perfect segue into the elephant in the
room
our hackintosh lacks the Mac Pros 6
Thunderbolt expansion ports your opinion
may differ but ultimately I believe it's
ok we sacrifice those ports yes but we
gained PCI Express slots that will give
us expansion to 10 gigabit USB 3 if
needed in the future and even allow us
to set up more exotic solutions I mean
for the money that we saved
we could build a wickedness with a bunch
of hard drives a high-performance raid
card and a 10 Gigabit Ethernet
connection then we could grab a 10
gigabit ethernet switch and an adapter
for our PC and then we've created a
storage solution that unlike a
Thunderbolt enclosure which is
accessible to one PC is accessible to
several and offers much more flexibility
the flipside of which is of course just
like the hackintosh that it requires
more tinkering speaking of tinkering I
would like to take this opportunity to
give a big thanks to Andrew there's
going to be a link to his website here
he helped us out a lot and asked me to
reinforce that No
hackintosh guide is meant to be the
be-all and end-all
and unless you're building this exact
machine with this exact OS you'll very
likely need a bit of assistance and
that's okay the good news is that thanks
to Andrew and others like him who you
asked me to credit here in this video
help is out there and you can reach out
to those guys who are members of this
great community if you you know your
appetite was wetted by this video and
you really want to set out and make
yourself a hackintosh and if you do go
for it have fun we certainly did
although we really don't know what to do
with the machine now since neither of us
are really care that much about OS 10
maybe let me know guys if you think I
should if I should legitimately try and
use it for a little while be as my
favorite game reviewer Yahtzee would say
it's gonna be about like watching a cat
trying to fly a kite so we'll see anyway
guys like this video if you liked it
dislike it if you disliked it you'll
find a link to the parts that we used
and a discussion thread on the Linus
