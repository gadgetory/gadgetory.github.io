and as far as I know pretty much
everyone else knows almost nothing about
this is a product that is so brand-new
that this is the first one in Canada and
I don't mean the first retail one in
Canada I mean the first one this is the
first one in the country
so our BenQ contact was able to give us
the hookup to bring this to you pretty
early this monitor actually isn't even
going to be available at retail for
probably around the end of August so
it's least another month okay and let's
get started here so this is a MVA panel
it is LED backlit so between those two
qualities right there off the hop we
should be looking at a monitor that
exhibits exceptional color reproduction
it is a 27 inch 1080p monitor so it's a
very very good size so what I found
about 24 in time I personally use a
30-inch monitor at home and what I found
about 24 inch is it's a touch small
especially for people who have trouble
reading texts when you have a very high
pixel density so 27-inch was something
that what I found was a very good
balance for people like my parents who
don't see quite as well as they used to
so you've got that same 1080p resolution
which is a hundred percent ready for all
HD content but you've got a little bit
more size to it so it looks a little
more more more blown-up
okay so let's start with vbase mm-hmm
very nice check this out so we've got a
brushed metal finish but I can tell from
here there's either oh okay yeah we have
a plastic cover on it so let's see what
its gonna look like when we remove that
because it's got some bubbling under it
there we go
mmm that's more like it okay so that
looks like a brushed stainless steel
it's got a very very slick look to it
see how fingerprint proof it
hey not bad actually that's not bad at
all very nice one of the problems I have
with brushed aluminum which this really
doesn't look like is that from time to
time you can get brushed aluminum
finished as but as soon as you touch
them once indelible fingerprint is on
there forever because the acid in your
fingers will will etch it so hopefully
they don't have that problem with this
one but it looks so far like the oils
are not staying on it so if you have
certain coatings or if you have brushed
steel for example it's much more
resilient than just a bare brushed
aluminum finish all right let's get some
of the packaging removed here as well
like I said guys I'm flying blind here I
know almost nothing about this thing
other than that it's a VA panel it's 27
inches it's LED backlit and it's
actually pretty slick looking okay so
let's get let me get it assembled on the
stand and I'll be back in a minute so
guys I've assembled it now this is a
premium product so aesthetics matter
okay
period they matter so let's have a look
at the overall aesthetics of this
particular monitor let's start with the
base which we looked at already once now
what it appears is that the base is a
brushed metal finish as is the stand but
what is actually the case is that if I
tilt the stand more and more and more
you're gonna see there you go I here
look at it look at it straight on it's
actually just a chrome sort of very
ultra shiny finish so what happens is
when you're sitting in front of the
monitor and you look at it from the
front it appears to completely match the
finish of the base which is kind of a
neat little effect however when you look
at it from the back you can clearly see
the super shiny finish that is is this
little rectangular stand right here so I
actually like that it's a nice touch
it's something a little bit different um
but it's not something different that's
bad would you see so often on monitors
these days all right the panel itself
has a black frame that is edged by just
I'm gonna take this off and then we'll
look at it separately in a minute but
it's kind of detracting from the overall
look at the monitor right now so it's
got a black bezel not a super thin bezel
but this is a large screen likely not
intended to be
used in a multi-screen environment most
people don't have room for two or three
27-inch monitors on their desks so I
would consider that just fine you've got
a bit of a silver edge around it and
then on the bottom you see a thicker
silver edge now what this does is it
houses the power button all the
on-screen display controls are touch
sensitive here on the side and then the
other thing that the bottom part houses
is speakers so you can see we've got
stereo speakers
I love the stealth implementation of the
speaker's because I really hate seeing
them on the front of the monitor I
prefer something that I'm gonna be
looking at to be something that I look
at not something that I can see it makes
down so having them down here even
though it's gonna hurt audio quality a
little bit I've still very much prefer
and let's face it if you're using the
speakers built into your monitor how
concerned are you with audio quality by
some real speakers if you want good
audio quality so I actually really like
to see that let's move around and let's
have a look at the back of the monitor
once more so you can see you've got a
very glossy finish on the back in terms
of fingerprint proof nests yeah it's a
boat I'd say it's about middle of the
road you can see the fingerprint but you
can also wipe it off quite easily even
without a cloth so that's not bad at all
and I said those were touch sensitive on
the side there actually looks like the
buttons are on the back so that's fine
having them on the back is okay because
you do have that tactile response so if
you were trying to feel around the back
for touch sensitive buttons that
obviously wouldn't work very well at all
would it okay let's have a look at the
inputs and outputs and all that good
stuff we've got our AC power in so
that's a universal input 100 to 240
volts we've got our headphone jack a
line in so this is pretty good to see
and a line out so I'm not sure exactly
how that works with the headphone and
the line out but it's possible they have
an audio switch if anyone wants to do
that research for me and leave a comment
under the video if you guys could all
thumbs up so we all know exactly how
these work that would be great over here
we can see something fairly obvious we
have two HDMI inputs so that means you
can have your computer hooked up well
you could have your computer hooked up
by HDMI then you got your ps3 and your
Xbox tucked up or rather by DVI and then
you can hook up a couple other devices
by HDMI so you have three digital inputs
as well as your more
traditional VGA input which I still do
find cause to use every once in a while
and finally there's your USB input
because that is going to be powering the
four port hub on the side of the monitor
now let's have a look at the accessories
so first thing here is we have a little
remote so it looks like we can use this
Hey okay Wow I was I was I was even you
know I was kind of giving it a hard time
I was like oh it has you know touch
panel for the on-screen display oh no it
doesn't well actually has a remote so
that's a pretty cool feature too so you
can mute you can change the input you
can use the set side feature you can
looks like this changes the scaling
honestly I'm guessing right now you can
adjust the volume brightness contrast
and you can navigate the on-screen menu
entirely with the included remote that
includes a battery alright next we have
the USB cable so they've included that
you don't need to buy one next we have
an audio cable so that'll plug into the
back of your computer or the back
yourself card vga cable this is a
questionable inclusion I think if you're
buying a nice true 8 bit 27 inch 1080p
monitor you're probably going to be
using DVI or HDMI but at least you have
something functional in the meantime
while you pick up another cable and
finally we have a standard computer
power cable so let's see what else they
have to say for themselves on this
little document that we got rid of so
ultra high three thousand to one native
contrast ratio so that is not a dynamic
contrast ratio that is a true contrast
ratio it's actually I mean it doesn't
sound that impressive when you compare
it to the one hundred thousand to one
contrast ratios that are advertised but
on some panels but that's a dynamic
ratio so a lot of the time you're going
to be compromising on the overall image
quality by using that dynamic
intelligent contrast ratio versus just
having a panel that is able to display
whiter whites and blacker blacks without
any voodoo magic okay we've got a true
8-bit color 8-bit color panel so that
would be my expectation for anything
that's in this kind of a price range
that claims to deliver excellent
reproduction awesome to see we have two
HDMI inputs USB times four we've covered
this dual three watt built-in speakers
yeah three watt like I said if you want
great audio quality maybe get something
else but these will be functional if you
just want a nice clean aesthetic like
you can see the demo they had here where
the monitor is just sitting entirely by
itself and has some kind of okay there's
a mouse and there's a keyboard I don't
know where it's getting aI don't know
where it's getting a video input from
but I think they're making their point
anyway and last but not least it does
have a remote control so you can control
all of your inputs and whatnot remotely
just don't let your little brother or
sister get their hands on this because
you'll be sitting at your computer and
they'll be behind you changing the input
on you every 30 seconds you'll be like
oh what's going on with roll with my
monitor they're gonna send an armada
BenQ and they're gonna be like well
where's your remote and then trouble
so in summary 27 inches true 8-bit VA
panel available sometime at the end of
August I should say August 2011 cuz who
knows how long from now you'll be
watching this video it has what would
appear to me to be somewhere in between
a mat and a glossy finish and I've
actually seen this before and I'm a big
fan I don't generally prefer glossy
screens because they're very reflective
if you have a light behind you it can be
distracting and disruptive to your
workflow or to the image quality of a
game or whatever the case may be but
this is a good balance because you do
have some reflection but it's not a
mirror-like surface so you get some of
that extra vibrancy from the colors from
having a slightly more glossy finish but
you don't have quite the same degree of
distraction that you would from a full
glossy finish 1080p to HDMI inputs and I
think that's pretty much it thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
look at the e W 27:30 from Ben Q don't
forget to subscribe to Linus tech
couture on boxing's reviews and other
computer videos one last thing I forgot
sorry guys is that it does include the
mounting holes for a standard VESA mount
so you can just pull this bottom stand
right off and you can mount it using an
arm or whatever the case may be using
the standard VESA mount
