episode about adaptive vsync so this is
all about the technology that makes
geforce cards that feature adaptive v
saying pretty much the best thing ever
for LCD users so back when we were all
using CRTs and we were lucky to get 30
to 40 fps in our games and CRTs at the
high end we're capable of 75 85 Hertz we
didn't worry too much about the frame
rate going over the refresh rate of the
monitor so to be clear the frame rate is
how many frames per second or fps or
images per second the video card could
potentially output to a display device
in this case you can see our frame rate
is around 150 fps in battlefield 3
staring at a wall this is with a 660ti
refresh rate is how many images the
screen can draw in a second so this is a
pretty fast monitor this is a 120 Hertz
monitor for 60 Hertz monitor users this
is going to be even more of an issue
because you're much more likely to have
these out of sync so 120 and 150 what
that means is this video card is feeding
this 150 images and this monitor is
displaying only 120 of them so what that
means is while the video card is in the
middle of changing from this position
actually here let's do it this way from
something being in this position to this
position the monitor might pick up half
of this one and half of this one and you
get this disjointedness between where
the image is split called
tearing so caring only occurs when the
frame rate goes above the refresh rate
this is an extreme example of tearing
this is not an artifact this is us
looking at something and seeing the dot
tearing so you can actually also see it
in the line here I don't know if you
guys are going to be able to see that
very well but you can see it gets quite
distorted and quite crappy so you can
see like it breaks up like this so the
way to combat
is to turn on vsync or vertical sync
what that does is it locks your
framerate at the refresh rate of your
monitor the problem with vsync is that
when you get into an action-packed
scenario vsync has to keep the refresh
rate or rather the frame rate at an even
crap I always forget as a factor
whatever the thing it has to multiply
out to the refresh rate of the monitor
so if you run into a like a firefight
and you would have normally dipped to
110 fps it'll actually knock you all the
way down to 60 and then all the way down
to 30 and all the way down to 15 until
it reaches one where you can keep that
sustained framerate so what we're going
to do is we're going to show you how
adaptive vsync gives you the best of
both worlds whenever you're going to be
running too high vsync will
automatically turn on and whenever
you're going to be running too low or
below that refresh rate vsync will turn
off which will allow you to run at 110
or 100 FPS rather than knocking you all
the way down to 60 and giving you that
difference so we're going to turn on
adaptive you think and we're going to
come back and look at this wall and show
you what a difference it makes to the
tearing this that that goes on you can
change this in the manage 3d settings of
your Nvidia control panel so we're going
vertical sync instead of using the 3d
application setting we're gonna go with
adaptive grey adaptive D sing all right
let's fire up our game again and see if
this actually works I don't know if it
will no it looks like we're gonna have
to have to restart our game here slick
thought it might work but I thought he
was wrong and it looks like I was right
alright so here we go we have adaptive
vsync on which means you can see that
were pinned at 120 fps which means that
after we chop this thing ah no tearing
artefacts see that that is what it is
supposed to look like without all of
those lines same thing if we look back
and forth on these pillars we're not
going to see that horrible separation
now let's go find ourselves a firefight
and let's see what happens to the
framerate so as soon as we drop below
120
yes instead of knocking us all the way
down to 60 we should be able to achieve
like you know 119 or 117 or 115 so there
you go that is adaptive vsync it means
we don't have to deal with bullcrap
tearing which looks terrible and is very
very distracting because you can have
the most beast machine in the world and
it's almost the more beast of a machine
you buy the more susceptible you are to
this horrible visual anomaly and so we
don't have to deal with that and we
don't have to deal with dipping all the
way down to 60fps which I personally can
tell the difference between 60 and 120
whatever you people who think that you
can't tell the difference you guys are
just totally wrong and I'm sorry
but get a better machine and again get a
better monitor and you will understand
so I don't have to suffer with 60 or 30
FPS but I don't have to deal with
tearing so it's like like the best thing
ever
thank you Nvidia for bringing us
adaptive vsync which you can see
continuing to work here as we watch
these frame rates move all over the
place and do what they do
I'm going to play me some battlefield 3
and I actually kind of like this mouse I
haven't tried it before see him storm
