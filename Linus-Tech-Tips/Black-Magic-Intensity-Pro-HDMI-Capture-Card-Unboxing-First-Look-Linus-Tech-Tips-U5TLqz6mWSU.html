if you haven't already seen my videos
where I unbox the fs700 camera and our
new Manfrotto tripod and ahead you can
watch this one where I'm unboxing our
Blackmagic intensity Pro HDMI capture
card so what this is going to allow me
to do is use a high quality camera to do
even things like live streams and
webcasts and stuff like that so HDMI
captured ok well let's see what black
magic has to say for themselves ok HDMI
an analog HD SD video editing part k
includes on-air video mixing on-air
software allows real-time mixing between
multiple video sources such as cameras
requires intensity or intensity Pro
installed in a fast host system for each
video input and on-air software will
auto sync video cameras display
monitoring recorded discs cool stop HD
mine analog components that's great for
HDTV or standard definition editing at
an uncompressed video because remember
guys when you have a fancy-pants camera
like an fs700 you can record to SD you
can record the memory stick but you're
going to be recording an AVCHD you will
not be recording uncompressed video so
that's what video capture is fantastic
for ok compressor gottayou dissipates
friendly professional compressor if
required and density includes the same
Blackmagic Design video technology used
on Hollywood feature films so quality
won't limit your creativity cool stuff
alright let's open this up have a look
at what we've got in terms of
accessories I actually have two of these
cards coming well two of them are here
see there's two and these will be used
to run a multi-camera setup using xsplit
and record live to tape for things like
unboxings so you can see yeah look at
that they're using as eye links Spartan
chip on there they've got what appears
to be some DDR one or DDR cue memory
that's either way it's not ddr3 you can
tell from the package size are they
using a PCIe bridge chip no it looks
like this is a native PCIe 1x card very
short card so on the back all you've got
is HDMI in HDMI out and then the adapter
for analog so this is not a DVI
connector even though it kind of looks
like one okay
kind of looks like DVI but it's not this
is a breakout cable so you just go ahead
and plug that in there we won't be using
any of the analog though analog is for
hosers at this point well maybe it isn't
that enough maybe you have a very good
reason why you still capture analog
video maybe have like a fantastic analog
video card so it looks like these are a
full set of in and out for component and
audio so one of these Reds over here
there's your audio one and then you have
a RGB and then some kind of okay
whatever that is so yeah so two sets one
in one out and we won't be using any of
it because we don't care Oh what's this
no no no what this is like an s-video is
that like an s-video adapter or
something I look like I spent this video
I think so it's probably for like two of
these like two of these are probably
labeled in some ways so that you can use
them for whatever this is oh maybe it's
composite or something I don't know what
they're doing here but it doesn't matter
it's an HDMI capture card it captures it
up to 1080p 30fps so that'll be perfect
for like a dual cam setup where we want
to capture 1080p at 30fps it can also do
720p at 60 fps and what else have we
missed here switch between HD instantly
oh yeah it works on OS 10 as well as
windows works with Final Cut Pro
Premiere Pro After Effects Photoshop
lots of other cool stuff and that's
pretty much it so we've got two of these
now which is very exciting times for
