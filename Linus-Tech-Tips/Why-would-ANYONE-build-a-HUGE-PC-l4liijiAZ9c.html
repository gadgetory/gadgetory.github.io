are smaller faster and more
energy-efficient so the power of a full
tower can be crammed into something like
the Corsair one so then why the balls
are people still buying massive towers
like the obsidian 900 d here is this
just pure EP machine or are there
practical reasons like the practical
reason to check out our sponsor Humble
Bundle Humble Bundle lets you save money
on games and help support charity you
can learn more through our partner links
in the video description
ah so right here is your typical
mid-tower with bleeding edge gaming
specs now let's imagine for a second
that you want a machine with the same
specs but at literally one third of the
size while a custom small form-factor is
an option like the insane orthrus that
we built last year we opted to compare
to the new corsair one because inside
this sleep trashcan chassis is the
highest performance per volume that we
have tested compared to the mid tower we
did note slightly higher CPU
temperatures in the one but the GTX 1080
Ti in this thing is liquid cooled
allowing higher boosts so yeah this
small form-factor
technically actually outperformed the
air-cooled mid tower in our gaming
benches while maintaining a similar
level of noise of course CPU
overclocking results would typically be
slightly lower than a mid tower but for
games this will almost never make any
kind of noticeable difference and the
pricing between a DIY small form factor
and the mid tower is similar as well so
then what is the downside to this type
of a machine a big one is the lack of
expandability you want to throw a three
and a half inch you know twelve terabyte
hard drive in here you will need to use
external storage which kind of kills the
elegance of a machine like this whereas
with a mid tower you can crown like four
in here and not only will that not be a
problem but you won't even see them
because of the way that the internals
are laid out it's really sleek this
gives you terabytes upon terabytes of
storage right inside your computer wait
hold on a minute here so if you can get
all of the performance and the expansion
out of this guy why would you want to go
bigger alright let's make our way over
here
so if you're a serious business gaming
aficionado and all about that dual card
action you need not just the space to
fit the cards because a mid Tower even
some small form factors can fit them but
you also need space for them to breathe
though with that said the truth is these
days even a single GTX 10 ATT I can haul
in most titles even in 4k and SLI
scaling leaves a lot to be desired
with that said if you were doing
something like a multiple user machine
like we did in this very one for our
triple headed vr gaming machine a full
tower is pretty much your only option
though I wouldn't call that a super
common use case one other reason though
Ram expandability while a handful of ITX
boards which is what you're gonna be
stuck with if you go with something like
this have four memory slots going ATX or
up enables you to deck out your rig with
up to a hundred and twenty eight gigs
around so at that point you're able to
load your games onto a ram disk have
multiple virtual machines or I don't
know analyze particle collisions for
CERN to be honest we're having
difficulty coming up with a realistic
scenario where this much RAM would be a
practical investment for a desktop user
so that rationale takes a bit of a
backseat bringing us to number three
cooling a full Tower enables you to not
only slide a fat 360 millimeter a IO in
there plus another one for your graphics
card if you're into that sort of thing
it also makes it much easier to run a
custom water cooling loop I mean yeah if
you've got the skills with a Zed you can
make a sick loop in a mid Tower or again
even smaller but a full-size one is much
easier to work with especially if unlike
me you've got big hands you can also
fill a full tower up with a redonkulous
amount of local storage so it's kind of
like what this can do
this can do better though sometimes that
will come at the expense of radiator
space finally a full tower is a bigger
canvas to showcase your hardware cabling
and your you know mucho RGB so it's a
flex piece but what about the downsides
well your typical full Tower always
costs more than a mid Tower from the
same manufacturer because it's just more
material and it costs more to ship it
around and have you ever tried moving
one of these especially by yourself the
900 d empty with no hardware in it
weighs more than twice as much as the
Corsair one with a full system in it so
unless you're into using your computer
as weightlifting equipment it's that's
not a practical selling point so let's
summarize then as compared to a mid
tower a 20-18 small form-factor
is almost as fast is smaller lighter
about as loud costs about the same and
only really lacks in overclocking
potential and local storage if you're
not using an ass on the other hand a
full tower while more expensive not to
mention heavier enables wider graphics
card options more RAM and more local
storage on top of and I really think
this is the biggest reason being easier
to work in as well as being a bigger
stage for showcasing your hardware
computer hardware that is of course
