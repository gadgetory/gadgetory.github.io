tech emotion because you know some of
their products have been in low end at
low price point so you know more value
oriented products but one of the ones
that I had an opportunity to have a look
at and that I actually use regularly now
is the pulse wave what I like so much
about that product sorry I'm not going
to even talk about this at all for now
i'll talk about the pulse wave for a bit
one of the things i like about it is the
fact that it allows you with the flip of
a switch to either use the onboard USB
sound card or use the analog sound input
so what that means is when like the
speakers i have on my desk at work or
not they don't have a proper headphone
out port on the front so what that means
is that unless i was using a USB headset
then i couldn't actually have two
different audio devices at the same time
so that was kind of a pain if I was
stupid cuz my front audio doesn't work
on my case so what I did was I was able
to use the USB in that scenario and then
when I want better quality audio out of
it and I have a proper sound card then I
can just not use the USB and I can
switch to analog I thought that was cool
I don't use the vibration functionality
of it at all that particular aspect of
that headset i think is a bit of a
gimmick but what i do use is the just
generally comfortable and very good
sounding headset considering the price
point and considering the sort of you
know less professional audio oriented
kind of positioning that they had for
their like yeah like something that
vibrates a little blah so you would
expect it to not sound very good but
then it did so that's that's what i
liked about it so moving on to the
intruder which is the headset that we
have here today what do we got here in
terms of accessories and whatnots you
mean give me just a moment here and i
will tell you guys exactly what we're
dealing with
so the first thing we find is haha here
we are ah which direction does this go
this is going to go this way so we have
a detachable mic which i'm personally a
big fan of I'm I don't always you know
need to when I'm wearing my head so
headphones I don't always need to look
like you know a gamer necessarily
depending where I am so attachable mike
is capable of moving sort of in this
range okay so consider way by your mouth
or can sit a little bit away from it
okay what else we got here we have sort
of a bit of a harder foam but a very
desirable shape so they've gone with an
ear shape which is sort of seems like
rocket science when you look at most
most headsets where they have round
shapes or oval shapes well this looks
like in here which is good because it's
designed to fit over an ear it's like I
said it's not really the softest foam
I've ever felt um but what they've gone
for I guess is more lightweight in terms
of more padding and cushioning which is
what it has on the pulse width which is
the one that the one that I regularly
use this is kind of neat check this out
so it actually uses a headset jack so
you could use this with your phone to
make phone calls if you if you so
desired which is kind of handy in fact
it includes two microphones apparently
so hold on a second and I will figure
out where that other microphone one okay
guys I figured it up so it has a fairly
wide variety of different attachments
and adapters and dongles and doodads and
there's different ways to use sort of
all of them so it has two microphones it
has the gaming mic which is like your
typical huge microphone that sits in
front of your mouth then it has a
mobility Mike so this one is intended
for you so if you're like making a phone
call or something so you're out and
about you're just using these as
headphones and you've got your
smartphone or whatever else with you you
use this jack right here which is
smartphone compatible and you got just a
little mic down here so
sit right in front of your mouth while
you're sitting on the bus right ok so
there's those two microphone options
then on this side of things you can
either plug this in for right angle okay
or you can plug this into here where you
get your inline volume control as well
as your microphone mute okay so that's
on the controller here and then it goes
out to your dedicated headphone and
microphone jacks and then for whatever
reason they've also included the ability
to adapt it back to one of the three
bend connectors which you can use to
plug into a smart phone or whatever else
then you can give it a right angle so
they've included all these different
adapters giving you a ton of different
options in terms of cable length so you
can have a nice long cord that can reach
to your your other device or you can
have a short one in fact speaking to the
cord length its oh I don't know about to
Linus arms fans long which you look
about 11 feet long so now let's have a
closer look at the headset itself so i'm
going to put the the gaming mic on you
just you put it on sideways and then you
rotate it obvious locked in place and I
ya hear let's have a closer look so
these are these are rotatable look at
that that's a wider range of rotation
than I typically see so that means that
no matter how your ears are oriented on
your head you're not gonna have too much
difficulty fitting it on correctly not
as much padding like i said as i have on
the pulse wave but like it okay it is a
lightweight headset so I guess that's
that's to be expected um let's see it's
a fairly open design I can hear myself
very very clearly while I'm talking here
so I wouldn't expect much of the noise
of whatever it is that you're listening
to to be isolated from the people around
you very good overall aesthetic this is
the kind of thing that you wouldn't have
to be other than the word intruder which
maybe you could maybe you could scratch
off you wouldn't have to be too
embarrassed to wear something like this
out in public especially if you don't
have the gaming mic on it you just clip
this to wherever
then run it down to your pocket to your
phone so it's a good length for that if
you're just gonna like that there you go
it's about right so they've got pretty
much covers it thank you for checking
out my unboxing and first look at the
intruder from tech in motion so it's a
lightweight sort of if they call it a
gaming headset but you can use it for
pretty much anything in fact if I'd even
looked at the box i would already know
this so pc and mac mobile devices
removable mike headband 40 wow really 40
mil speakers huh Wow meep so don't
forget to subscribe to my linus tech
tips channel for unboxings reviews and
other computer videos and thank you for
checking out this video on the tech and
motioning truter and one more thing that
I hadn't talked about just yet so you
got the folding design here we go and it
comes with a carrying bag</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
