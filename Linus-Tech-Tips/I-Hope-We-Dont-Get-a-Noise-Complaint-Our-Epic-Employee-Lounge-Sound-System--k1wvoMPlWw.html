on the BFG D is pretty cool
it's HDR 1000 it can run it any refresh
rate so no matter what frame rate your
contents running at it's perfect with no
judder or anything like that but it's
got a fundamental flaw it's only
available in a mere 65 diagonal inches
so at risk of becoming you know that guy
today's video is gonna be about this
upgrade we are going to be getting ah
the best of all worlds by upgrading to a
120 inch projector screen and at the
same time we're gonna be installing a
sound system you guys thought this cool
that's great
with this sub I sincerely hope we don't
end up with any noise complaints
speaking of me sitting here with you
know my legs all spread like this our
sponsor today Mac Weldon Mac Weldon
makes terrific underwear including their
antimicrobial silver line that makes it
so that even if your junk stinks your
underwear won't stink as bad that's
right
antimicrobial so go check out Mac Weldon
and use off the code tech tips 20 to
save 20% at the link below
okay so Riley I don't know how you got
roped into this but no either here's the
plan for today basically it's twofold
we're not actually ditching the TV we
still need that 4k 120 Hertz gaming
goodness yep but we're gonna take this
projector screen and put it in front of
the TV because that's how projectors
work so if you want to watch no no no
the projector goes way over here and it
fires that but if you want to watch a
movie you use the projector and if you
want to play a game the projector and
then we're doing a five point one point
two yeah clips dolby atmos blah blah
blah
sounds set up this I can't believe this
thing it looks like a weapon
it's the r11 5sw uh-huh which means w4
sub woofer one one five four fifteen
inch the more you know we won't even
need a side table what if you put
anything on it it's just gonna fall off
from all the the sick webs do we have to
unbox this should we call lure that's
only if we have too much unboxing and
we're feeling sick so I haven't had a
Clips audio setup since my pro media
ultra five point one's long story but
they were given to me by a previous
girlfriend and current girlfriend didn't
like me hanging on to them now that's a
speaker this bad boy will get you at
least 55 watts this is ridiculous yeah
and they fit perfectly how much is this
setup they sent over oh no I think the
two bookshelf slash monitors are like
800 bucks just for those two wow this is
a little bigger right that's what you
say so the cool thing about Dolby Atmos
is that instead of the movie studio
having someone go in and manually code
like you know the helicopter moving from
here to here and what the mix is between
the left and the right and the rear
channels and whatever else every object
that makes sound is instead just given
an exact
position in 3d space and then your dolby
atmos receiver which we already have
from our last upgrade here is going to
use however many speakers you have and
wherever they are to best approximate
the original intent of the movie
producer so these are not as good as if
we had more upper channels and more
surround channels but this already
seemed pretty over-the-top so we can't
really fit anything behind yeah
- Linus look they go these aren't that
dissimilar from an actual like an actual
weapon like your your tongue yeah yeah
yeah well you wouldn't use it like that
that's for sure you've taken you've
taken martial arts haven't you I had
kind of imagined just like like just
like a rollable kind of like like a
vinyl blind you know yeah so then you
reached out to East Porter's audio and
video and asked them for like a $700
still tab tension but like just a
regular cheap screen I was like we don't
need nothing crazy right and then they
responded with this a hundred and twenty
inch elumen 4k reference studio tab
tensioned crazy screen it's got these
little metal tabs that run down the side
and a big metal string I'm assuming and
a weight on the bottom and it keeps the
screen really flat and so in ten years
hopefully it still will be perfect how
was a projector screen 4k o 4k there's
the big thing apparently it's just cuz
the fibers are really fine as opposed to
some projector screens so they won't
show any grit at all it's got the finest
fibers you've ever seen okay I've never
seen fibers this fine I haven't seen any
kind of fibers danger Wow must read
that's a circle does a circle but a
suicide a square why the kids tech
channel now that's a good idea
let's see this bracket is called an L
bracket like the letter
have many LMG employees does it take to
mount a laser pointer do put it in wow
that's gonna be really big yeah and you
want it bigger hey yep you're all over
the place thank you get a hold of
yourself
go drunk you're home oh man
they include drywall anchors please
nobody nobody install this with drywall
anchors it's only like 30 pounds tell me
a story all about how my life got
twisted upside down and I'd like to take
a minute to tell you about it cuz it's a
crazy story so take a seat I don't think
that's how that goes my hook is on the
wrong way here wow it does not look
straight at all really I mean we laser
leveled it didn't we yeah hey we don't
have enough clearance
ooh yep that that camera or the the
Wi-Fi antenna okay it looks like a
camera all right just I'm just gonna
take it out for now this is utter
madness
so the projector we're using is actually
a rescue from a previous project where
we mounted it to the front of my car
that was really that was really weird
anyway this is a more appropriate use
for this thing this is view sonics kind
of budget 4k projector cuz it's not
really
native 4k uses pixel shift technology
and we know that it's super bright it's
3,500 lumens so we're gonna go ahead
we're gonna use this puppy and I put not
to a fans in it oh yeah it was a little
loud out of the box but check out this
upgrade BAM I found the only projector
rounds I could get that was long enough
to fit underneath that light okay I'm
gonna put the screen back down so we can
at least kind of like sanity check the
numbers before we start drilling
so I guess flip it upside down first
right are you gonna hold it upside down
oh you will did you flip it already oh
nice so if we know it's just can you go
to the left a bit
you're in an awkward position
having to hold me
I was trying not to leave a mark on your
shoulder
Brian would have done it like that but
like wait how are you planning to screw
this in exactly it goes that's straight
enough right sure yeah yep for the
record I wanted to make it beefier than
this decoration where speak for wiring
you making another one of your little
checklists you have this ones on
cardboard so I guess we should start
with the first one projector HDMI I was
thinking maybe we use one of those spare
wires and like tape it to it and just
pull that wire down yeah the question is
how do we figure out which wire is which
did Brian label them maybe he did oh
yeah they're labeled Wow what a champ oh
boy oh boy sends the 12 feet that are in
the wall oh boy ah can I have the tape
that wasn't a great throw do you think
he stapled these to the wall you have
got to be kidding me he wouldn't he did
why we we have no we have no way of
doing this sir this is a super long HDMI
so let's see if we're gonna have enough
to go like maybe over and up or
something why don't we start with
figuring out exactly how long it needs
to be yeah we would need to add so much
to you over there we need like a second
one of these cables okay here Jake if I
can make this shot through that cross
beam then we don't have to move a lot oh
my god yeah I just explodes all in my
face great plan
what's up safety
that would be very safe okay I made
myself a better projectile this time oh
no no I have an idea it's fine hold on
did you do it
it's sort of I need a stick a very
expensive one hey ten of ten
so while Deeks getting power for the
projector screen sorted out I am getting
our Universal projector mount attached
to the bottom of the projectors
nom-nom-nom-nom-nom
guess the label was correct so for our
speaker runs we're using these little
aftermarket plugs called banana plugs
and there's no performance reason to do
it it's more of just a convenience thing
if you ever have to unplug and replug
things all right well it looks like crap
oh yeah look it's not the perfect length
of wire okay this is actually really
looks like it needs to go up not that
bad though okay so there that's up a few
inches I'm actually getting pretty close
to being ready to call it good ah so is
this basically like the plan no they're
supposed to go down in this weaker
standard oh all right well that is
better I need to do the length first
though so just leave that where it is so
all that's left then is the sub dose of
the web master 5000 katsu so yeah we
just need that RCA cable over here then
in power oh that worked it's definitely
on now moved some air by the way here
the gain is at 11 by the way I love that
it goes minimum to 11
[Laughter]
okay so it's working feel like that
seems bad so what we're doing right now
is we're it's not perfect but we're
doing like a calibration the receiver is
going to listen to the speaker positions
and then adjust the delays this might be
a little loud yet the remote Wow that is
so different holy oh the babe it's a
little overpowering
maybe 11 wasn't the right choice yeah
maybe 11 could be a so we got the dolby
access app loaded up we got Atmos turned
on so you can tell from the indicator up
here we did have to make one small
adjustment where we had to set our
receiver to output audio only to the
speakers not to the speakers and the TV
that's fine we got that sorted out so
now over watch hey let's watch that we
should check out check out some of these
demos so what you guys are seeing right
now is with filming lights still on with
them off it's actually pretty darn
impressive and shockingly we actually
managed to get the position of the
projector pretty much bang on we're
gonna need some light though just so we
can see what the crap we're doing so
cinematic experience
pretty damn good I am absolutely blown
away by this projector actually yeah
once we have it in a light controlled
environment that is not bad this screen
I think costs more than that projector
but I mean the screen is a big part of
what makes a projector sound good right
so I'm not gonna say like movie theater
experience but like we're getting there
definitely getting there we're close
yeah we'll be we'll be going with that
what is this are they trying to have a
story in Mortal Kombat but it shut up it
isn't it not it is not
how do I stop stop it you're so mean
good Annie Jake I mean obviously we're
still gonna game on The BFG Dee whenever
possible but really not bad so I guess
that pretty much wraps up the movie
watching experience upgrade we satisfied
I'm pretty satisfied this is freaking
awesome I'm like blown away the one
thing I can think of that we need to do
is bring the seats up a little bit and
then we could probably be convinced to
upgrade the projector at some point you
know 8k you know whatever maybe if the
operator I think the input delay on that
we came along but man this is freaking
unreal I'm getting a little bit of DLP
rainbow effect but it's certainly
finally noticed I've seen personally
