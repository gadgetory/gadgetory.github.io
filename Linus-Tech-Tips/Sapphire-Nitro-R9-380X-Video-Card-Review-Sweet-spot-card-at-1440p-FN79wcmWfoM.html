capable GPUs and higher resolution
monitors falling in price gaming at
1440p is becoming an attractive option
for people who want to go beyond the now
standard 1080p experience but don't want
to fork out tons of cash for a 4k setup
with that in mind today we're looking at
AMD's new Radeon r9 380 X an upper
mid-range card squarely focused on the
1440p market how does it stack up to the
competition in terms of performance and
value stay tuned to find out and if you
guys like the video once you're done hit
that like button up Corsair is RMI
series power supplies feature premium
components for great performance with
very low noise click the link in the
video description to learn more let's
start off by having a look at the
important specs of our 380 X like it's
slightly cheaper little brother the r9
380 the 380 X features a tonga GPU but
packs more stream processors for a
performance boost you also get a fairly
standard allocation of 4 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory a 256-bit memory interface
and at least a 970 megahertz core clock
with support for DirectX 12 Vulcan and
mantle api's our review sample is a
sapphire nitro edition featuring a 70
megahertz out-of-the-box overclock a
dual fan open aired cooler and a plastic
backplate reference cards aren't
available quite yet but you'll get a
similar look to other recent generate
Aeon cards with a black shroud and
blower style fan you'll need to 6-pin
PCI Express power connectors to give
your card enough juice to properly run
as well for testing we compared the 380
X to a number of other mid-range to
high-end ish cards from an AMD to Nvidia
standpoint excluding the gtx 980ti and
the r9 fury series as those cards are
priced well above the target market for
the 380 X we use our standard test bench
inside of a cooler master master case
profile
you can see the specs of the test bench
here on the screen so let's have a quick
look at the results
our first test was to check the power
draw and temperatures at load the 380 X
performed about exactly where we
expected it smack in the middle of the
AMD product stack at 288 watts its power
draws about 70 watts higher than its
closest competitor on the nvidia side
the GTX 960 but is still by no means
unreasonable the GPU stayed at a
respectable 69 degrees Celsius so you
shouldn't have to worry too much about
temperatures north of the 80 degree kind
of mark that we've been having some
issues with with the r9 290 and 390
series for our game benchmarks we
started off with the notoriously
resource-hungry crysis 3 running at
1440p on the very high preset with FX
AAA enabled here we saw the 380 X pushed
34 frames per second beating out its
closest competitor that in on the nvidia
side the gtx 960 by 6 FPS moving on to
far cry 4 at Ultra settings at 1440p the
380 X mustard at 39 frames per second
beating out the GTX 960 by 4 fps and in
Tomb Raider at the same resolution and
ultimate settings we got 49 frames per
second compared to the 40 from the 960
but while these frame rates are
certainly playable they may not be quite
as smooth as you'd like so we put the
380 X through our suite of games again
but this time turn the graphics down to
one step below the maximum here we saw a
pretty substantial improvement
especially in Tomb Raider and Crysis 3
with the 3d X now pushing 75 and 50 for
FPS respectively Far Cry 4 saw a more
modest yet still noticeable bump at 44
FPS but just because this is a 1440p
focus card doesn't mean that's what you
have to use it for if you're rocking a
1080p monitor and want to say just max
out your games you can do so so we did
and the 3d X managed between about 53
and 70 FPS overall but what about value
the after mentioned performance gained
over the 960 does come at a cost at the
time of this video the cheapest gtx 960
on new a cost 55 dollars less than the
cheapest 380 X due to sales prices yes
but you'd normally be looking at a
closer to 25 to $30 Delta so does the
380 X make sense from a value-for-money
perspective our sapphire 3 the X is
selling on Newegg for 230 dollars well
you can pick up the same a sue Strix GTX
960 that we used for 210 looking at the
graph you can see a slight but not
earth-shattering advantage for the 3 DX
in terms of dollars per frame at 1440p
which may make the $20 premium a
worthwhile investment unfortunately we
didn't have an r9 318 on X to test
against but independent testing that we
have seen has shown that the X Edition
only gives you a boost of 2 to 3 FPS in
many cases so the plain vanilla 380 may
be a better choice if you don't care
about squeezing every last frame from
your wallet including every last dollar
so our conclusion is that while the 3d X
doesn't change the game in the 200 to
250 - ish dollar price point it's still
a solid entry for AMD for those who want
to game at 1440p with the settings
cranked too high or those you want to
get close to that 60 FPS holy grail at
1080p with everything cranked up if you
really want to max out games at 1440p
though and approach 60 frames per second
spending the extra 70 to 100 bucks on a
GTX 970 or r9 390 might have been a wise
decision if you have the extra cash
updesk has a wide range of powered
standing desks available on up desk comm
what almost all of them have in common
is the high quality dual motor
electronically controlled height adjust
system that lets you either manually
raise or lower the desk top surface or
pre-program three different heights for
sit-stand or maybe a ride on a
stationary bike or a walk on a treadmill
the one I've been using since updesk
equipted our office is the large size
squared up it's been a great solution
for me due to needing to sit at a corner
desk and I actively use the different
profile modes as I have back problems so
being able to rotate between sitting and
standing is great so whether you're
trying to just
get in the habit of shifting positions
periodically or if you want to get some
real health benefits out of your new
desk by putting a treadmill or
stationary bike under it so I go to up
