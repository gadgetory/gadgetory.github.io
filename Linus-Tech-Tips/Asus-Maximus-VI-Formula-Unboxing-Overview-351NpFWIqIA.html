to learn more welcome to my unboxing of
the Maximus 6 formula from a soos this
is probably out of all the z87 boards
the one that I can really look at and go
yes there is a very compelling value
here for this high-end board because it
includes things that I personally
believe in very strongly and that is a
nice high end Intel NIC solution with
prioritization with that said that's
included on a lot of the other issues
boards but where really gets real for me
so to speak on their formula grade
boards is the onboard audio solution so
here they have a bunch of stuff that may
or may not mean anything to you so Elna
premium audio capacitors audio
capacitors are not necessarily the same
as regular capacitors you can have a
great capacitor that's not necessarily
fantastic for audio applications alright
so they've also got what else what else
did they have to say about themselves
here supreme FX shielding EMI protection
cover okay differential design with
premium op amps Premium op amps is
definitely important here
why mah film capacitors from Hema rather
sorry saris logic CS a43 98 DAC and they
also have ATP a 6-1 to 0 a 2 a 600 ohm
hi-fi headphone amp so they sue this
whole thing with their onboard audio
solutions is that it's more than the sum
of the parts now they do list out all
the parts for you spec heads that really
want to know what's in there
but what they're trying to do and
they're using a lot of the experience
that they get from theirs donor cards is
they're trying to deliver a balanced
configuration right out of the box now
there are competitors that are offering
features such as swappable op amps on
their onboard solutions but it should be
noted that per a thread on the audio
section of the Linus tech tips forum
swappable op amps isn't necessarily a
good thing you shouldn't necessarily
even want to swap out your op amps
because the rest of the system was
designed around the one that it was
designed to run with and it's kind of
like you could put you know a thousand
horsepower end
in a Volkswagen Beetle but you probably
shouldn't because it will likely tear
the axles off if you actually tried to
go anywhere in it so it's that kind of
thing and it's less extreme than that
but I think you guys get my point
in terms of accessories we've got a full
kit not quite as Extreme as the Maximus
six extreme which makes a lot of sense
there's a manual with some useless discs
inside although you got a sweet-looking
ROG sticker in there so don't throw that
away while you're throwing away the disc
an SLI bridge with their awesome
Republic of gamers branding flexible
black perfect SLI bridge good job Asus
cute connectors a door hanger enter
champion to break and do not disturb it
champion in action I think they got a
bit of a champion to break it I think
they meant on break but whatever ah
we've got an antenna for the built-in
wireless AC as well as their combo card
that I personally really like so it
includes both Wireless and an NG F F
slot so that you can install a mini SSD
that'll can that will actually interface
with PCI Express rather than with a SATA
interface like you would an M SATA
because on a desktop let's face it what
is the point of installing an M SATA SSD
it doesn't perform any better it's just
you have lots of room alright next up
we've got the i/o shield as well as
eight serial ata three cables four which
are right angle 4 which are straight and
those little handy ROG labels for your
SATA cables so you don't lose track of
what's going where and why and how as
you guys may or may not have noticed
this is one secksy motherboard both
b-roll and I are in agreement that out
of everything we've looked at so far
this is going to be the best-looking
motherboard we've encountered they've
even done a few things that I think are
just just exceptional so I want to point
those out right off the bat so number
one is there rog armor so there is a top
plate as well as a backplate now the
back plate is actually the one I'm a
little bit more interested in because it
is metal and it has some definite
functionality so number one is it
increases the rigidity of the board
overall so if you were to over torque
any screws such as on when you're
installing your CPU heatsink the board
is less likely to bow and
Lexx and the other thing about it is
that the name armor is appropriate
because it is not that uncommon for
people to accidentally install an extra
you know standoff in the back of their
motherboard tray or anything like that
that can actually ruin your board and
cut traces on the back of your board if
you don't realize it in time this will
actually prevent that from happening in
most cases because it will just hit the
armor so there you go that's really cool
on the front it's a plastic shroud and a
soos themselves admitted to me that it's
more for aesthetics than anything else
with that said it does a fantastic job
of what it's trying to do which is
improve the aesthetics of the board this
one is plastic they've also said that
while they have observed a slight
temperature improvements particularly in
certain areas like around the PCI
Express slots where a lot of the time
those graphics cards are going to be
kicking off more heat than the
motherboard itself so it actually serves
to shield the motherboard from the heat
of other components more than help the
motherboard cool itself in that case but
other than that it doesn't really do too
much in terms of cooling on this
particular motherboards implementation
next up is their cross chill now I
really like the way that they've used
these stylized rubber plugs here as
opposed to just having the barb stick
out on the last generation board then
having little rubber plugs that are easy
to get lost so this allows you to run
the board either completely passively
with you know supplemental air cooling
with something like an mtech spot cool
or by putting your own geelong quarter
fittings on here and integrating it into
your custom loop with that said unless
you're running an anti corrosive
additives such as ethylene glycol I
probably wouldn't recommend running this
particular thing in your loop because it
does have aluminum internals as opposed
to copper internals and depending on who
you ask of course aluminum can be fine
and this or that case and it's probably
going to be okay and it probably will
but I've seen enough problems with
corrosion eating away at aluminum
components inside water cooling loops
that it is not something that I would
personally feel comfortable using unless
I had a good anti corrosive additive so
if you use something like swift Tec
heydrich s-- then you're going to be
golden now let's start with the overall
tour of the board up here in the top we
find that end
PFF M PCIe combo two-port where we can
put our wireless module as well as an NG
F F or m2 SSD we've got a fan header a
four pin and eight pin power connector
so while it's not the Maximus six
extreme which includes their OC panel it
so C panel compatible and it's certainly
extreme overclocking compatible I mean
not again not necessarily quite to the
same extent as the Maximus six extreme
although it does support some cool stuff
including their GPU hotwire which allows
you to over volt Asus GPUs that support
the feature on this particular board it
has their mmmokay button which allows
you to diagnose post errors that are
caused by memory not really working
correctly v checkpoints as well as an
onboard post readout start and reset
switches built in there's something I
wanted to draw your attention to it's
over here I was looking for it there
that's their patent pending for pin
three pin and detecting CPU fan
connector so it'll actually
automatically configure your fan control
which of course it has their latest fan
control software which you can access
through fan expert fan expert to I
believe is the iteration Ron which you
can access through AI suite allowing you
to have full control of every fan that
is plugged into the board but anyway
this one will detect on its own with no
intervention from the user for dual
channel ddr3 ports as well as an LGA
1150 socket supporting the latest has
well fourth generation Intel processors
the of course as you'll find on any rog
board the vrm is as pretty much as high
end as Asus can build so this is their
DIGI+ Gen 3 extreme engine so you can
configure anything you'd want from
within the BIOS to very very mine to a
very minut degree of accuracy down the
right-hand edge we find the 24 pin
exactly where it belongs would have
liked to see that front USB 3 connector
on our right angle that's one thing
where I think this board could still be
improved we've got six SATA three six
gigabit per second ports running off the
Intel chipset and for say two three six
gigabit per second ports running off of
an additional chipset this is a feature
that's a carryover from the extreme
board so it actually supports fastboot
on or off when you're particularly under
sub-zero temperatures you might not
necessarily want it to boot up as
quickly so you can actually turn fast
boot off alright we've got our front
panel
nectars as well as our front panel USB
to header only a single USB to header on
this board that's very interesting
there's that proprietary connector for
the OC panel the Thunderbolt header to
add thunderbolt support to the board
with an optional accessory trusted
platform module auxiliary power for
multiple graphics cards although it
should be noted that this board only
supports two-way SLI or up to 3-way
crossfire so that will be running in 16x
mode for a single card 8 X 8 X for dual
cards or 8 X for X 4 X 4 triple cards
and NVIDIA doesn't support SLI operation
on PCIe 4x slots this is something
that's kind of cool check this out you
guys
so asus has actually left open-ended PCI
Express slots on all the PCIe 1x slots
so if you were to remove the thermal
armor which you can you would be able to
install longer cards without any modding
which i think is pretty handy so anyway
if you wanted to install more than two
graphics cards I would recommend using
the easy plug right here we've got our
front panel audio connector and it's
ideal location on the bottom left of the
board as well as that redline audio
separation for the completely separate
PCB so it's completely separate from the
rest of the PCB it's as isolated as
their old supreme effects
implementations where they had a
separate PCIe riser card except that
it's built into the motherboard itself
so talking to talking to JJ from Asus he
said one of the tough questions that he
always gets is well what is a great
onboard audio solution equivalent to in
terms of an add-in card and he was
saying if you go to like a lesser board
such as the Maximus 6 hero for example
you're getting what's probably
equivalent to something like a zone Rd G
or DG X so about a $35 audio solution
with this you're probably getting
something that's a little bit closer to
a zone Rd X or about an $80 audio
solution which from my experience is
going to be enough for most people who
don't have like a golden audiophile ear
and you're of course going to get things
like their their on-screen radar
heads-up display that shows you where
the audio sounds are coming from I
actually asked JJ about this as well as
like has that been banned yet from
tournament play he's like ah I'm sure
that no tournaments going to allow you
to use it but apparently
informally Bend yet it's meant more for
I think the casuals playing at home then
for for tournament play definitely all
right so we've we've got eight eight for
pin fan connectors one two three four
five six seven eight and actually
they're very very well laid out so that
you're going to be able to plug in kind
of some you know top fans such as in
something like a Corsair 800 D you got a
couple rear fans you got your CPU fan
header and then you'll be able to plug
in something at the front of the case
and/or the bottom so very thoughtful
layout on that particular aspect of this
board I think that's getting pretty
close to the end here so let's move
around to the back where we've got ROG
connect is the ROG connect button even
though the cables not included it does
still feature that functionality so you
can hook it up to an external computer
or laptop to control all of your
overclocking settings at a hardware
level so the cable you'll have to get on
your own but if the functionality is
still there BIOS flashback for USB 2.0
ports six USB 3.0 ports DisplayPort HDMI
optical audio out Gigabit LAN provided
by Intel as well as 7.1 audio out oh it
should be noted that's a 12 17 V Intel
Gigabit LAN chip that is powering that
