coverage of Computex 2018 you can try
LastPass for free at the link in the
video description this is a hands-on
that is so exclusive only a handful of
people in the world have touched this
device so far that we had to come all
the way to a Seuss's headquarters in
order to get it this is the one unit of
what they're calling Project Precog
which takes an idea that we've sort of
seen before in the Lenovo yoga book
which had a touchscreen on the top and
then it had like a touch surface that
you could use as a keyboard and touch
pad on the bottom and takes it to a
completely different level so it's kind
of a notebook in the sense that like a
two-in-one you could use it on the desk
in front of you or in your lap in front
of you or you could flip it around and
use it just as a Windows tablet see that
got that Start menu this thing actually
does work by the way you guys or you
could put it in tent mode but then it's
also kind of just like a like a giant
flexible touch surface and they've got a
book mode that would allow you to use it
as well I mean I guess this is sort of
self-explanatory as as kind of a book
one of the most striking things about
the device to me is that they've
achieved near symmetry in the design so
the the top and the the bottom of the
laptop as concepts are sort of being
challenged here because check this out
so this surface here like yes this Asus
logo by the way none of this stuff is
final this is all very much in
engineering stages right now so this
Asus logo here is is right-side up if
you hold it this way but then you flip
it over to the other side and you could
just as easily have that logo here or
here there's no feet there's no nothing
you could literally put it down this way
open it up and there's absolutely no
reason why the keyboard and touchpad
couldn't just be on
side and that's actually a big part of
where the name of this product Precog
comes from asus knows that with great
flexibility you can actually lose some
of the intuitiveness of the device and
they're talking about some of the ways
that they plan to tackle this so for
example they want the finished product
to be able to detect when its keyboard
is moved near it so that the on-screen
keyboard could go away and the same
would go for something like a mouse this
is just a regular off-the-shelf mouse
but the example that they're talking
about it's like oh well maybe when you
move the mouse here now the touchpad
that is like sort of a virtual touchpad
on the bottom screen can go away and
maybe when that moves so you can take
more advantage of all this screen real
estate that you paid for the keyboard
itself could also move which I guess
brings us to the other challenge that a
seuss seems to be well aware of and yet
I still have my doubts about how they're
going to solve how do you make a
keyboard usable on a touchscreen how do
you make a keyboard experience that runs
as an as an as an image on a touchscreen
even remotely usable there are a couple
of main issues here that quite frankly
the solutions i've seen for so far are
not even close to adequate so first of
all is haptic feedback when you press
down on a key on a keyboard the the
response in your hands and your
fingertips needs to be instantaneous and
I have never experienced a haptic motor
that is fast enough or crisp enough that
I would consider it to be acceptable as
a replacement for a real keyboard and
then the other one is the positioning so
when I sit down at my laptop the first
thing that I do is run my fingers over
top of it and find the bumps for the
home row that's how within you know a
second or two I can be typing at full
speed
asus has actually
shared with me some of the ideas they
have for tackling these problems and I
have to say that my initial impressions
of the idea were much worse than they
are now but there's still a lot of work
to be done and they're not expecting any
kind of real product based on this
concept to be available until sometime
in 2019 with that said there's still a
lot that we can try to guess that based
on what we're seeing so far so in spite
of the thermal challenges because you
got to remember most laptops breathe
either through the bottom which this one
won't have a bottom because both of them
are the top the hinge or the keyboard or
some combination of the two it will have
to be basically passive but they're
still saying that they might expect to
be able to put core i7 grade Hardware in
it let's hope him tells next generation
has fantastic thermal and power
consumption properties we can also look
at the i/o so right now we've got a
couple of Thunderbolt three ports which
I am actually shocked to see in a form
factor like this either of which can be
used for charging based on our short
hands-on time with the product another
thing that we know is that the top and
bottom have only slight differences in
thickness so you can see it's just the
thickness of the glass right here that
is allowing them to put processor memory
storage battery somehow they've managed
to jam a battery in this thing are we
going to see some kind of a custom
shaped battery technology powering it
are we gonna maybe see them split up the
battery Apple actually did that in the
iPhone 10 where they put part of the
battery in one portion of the phone and
part of it elsewhere could we see
something where they put some battery
here and some there something I'm really
curious to see what they do with is
speakers so right now you can actually
see that's probably part of the reason
why we've got some extra thickness on
the bottom but we actually saw Sony demo
a TV as CES 2017 that had the speaker's
built into the panel of the glass so it
actually produced sound by vibrating the
glass and it sounded shockingly good I
mean
well I would love to see that technology
built into something like this but while
that all sounded really positive and
excited there are still a lot of
challenges for them to overcome like
right now do you think Windows 10 is
ready for this kind of an interface
hardly I mean even something as simple
as taking this chat window that's
running in there demo and dragging it
with your finger up to the oh wait
there's a hinge there so they might need
some kind of momentum based software
solution for flinging windows from one
screen on to the other so there's a lot
of software work still to be done here
but again I really wish I could tell you
guys more about how they're planning to
solve the keyboard problem I'm pretty
hopeful and I want to hear from you is
this kind of a device important is this
something that you guys want to see let
me know in the comments below and let me
know what you think are the biggest
challenge and the biggest benefit to a
device like this that's it's more screen
now than laptop you know folded and you
know not evil but but definitely bad you
know like in that way speaking of bad it
would be bad if you guys didn't check
out our sponsor here at Computex 2018
LastPass with LastPass all your
passwords can be stored conveniently in
your vault where they can be accessed on
any device from anywhere in the world
and even shared with people this is
something that has come in handy for me
a lot of times while I've been traveling
and LastPass stores more than just
passwords you could store your passport
number so that you can quickly jot that
into the website when you're trying to
check in for a flight for example it can
store your social security number or
your children's care card numbers so you
don't have to carry around cards that
are not only expensive to replace but
also a huge potential problem if they
get into the hands of narrow do wells or
even things like credit card numbers for
something like the the business credit
card that you would never actually carry
around but you might have to use from
time to time so track out
past you can try it out for free we're
gonna have a link in the video
description so thanks for watching guys
I hope you enjoyed what will probably be
the last video we upload from Computex
2018 we certainly saved the best for
last here and don't forget to subscribe
so you don't miss any of our videos on
Linus tech tips I'm shocked at how thin
they managed to make this thing in spite
of two touchscreens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
