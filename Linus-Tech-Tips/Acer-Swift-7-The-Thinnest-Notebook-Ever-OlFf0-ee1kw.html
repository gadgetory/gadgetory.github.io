yesterday I was making a video about the
thinnest notebook in the world and Here
I am doing the same damn thing again
meet the Acer Swift 7 it is even thinner
than the old King while costing
significantly less
cooller masters master case maker five
features they're freeform modular system
allowing you to customize adjust and
upgrade make it yours at the link in the
video description so naturally today's
video is going to contain a lot of
comparisons to the previous thinnest
notebook champion the HP Spectre 2016 so
let's begin then
with the raw physical impressions we
will start of course with thickness or
thinness is the Acer swift seven thinner
than the HP Spectre the answer is yes
was it impossible for me to tell without
running down to the workshop for a level
or a caliper tool also yes so then it
would appear that we've arrived at the
point where declaring one's device to be
thinner is purely an exercise in
bragging rights as opposed to a
meaningful advantage for the actual user
so let's move on then on the bottom of
the clamshell we find a unibody aluminum
design with an aluminum bottom plate
that is more rigid in my hands and
squeaks less while it flexes making it
feel more premium but that ends up
actually performing worse in my Bend and
see if it stays bent test than the
Spector's aluminum carbon fiber hybrid
approach with that said it's definitely
not the worst I've seen so if you don't
keep bowling balls in the same backpack
as your laptop this shouldn't be a huge
issue and Acer comes back swinging with
the display get it swinging like on a
hinge anyway while HP may be very proud
of their fancy-pants hidden hinge in
practice
Acer's more traditional hinge design
gives the display less flex overall and
more importantly bring screen wobble
back down to a level that I would
consider acceptable on the subject of
acceptable let's talk about IO HP
Rush's acer in this department with two
Thunderbolt three ports each capable of
carrying a display Thunderbolt or USB 10
gigabit data signal and a third five
gigabit USB port that doubles as a
dedicated power input while Acer brings
only two five gigabit USB threes to the
back end of its type-c connectors with
only one of them even capable of
carrying a DisplayPort signal I mean
this is still better than Apple's
MacBook because at least I can use
either of the included adapters HDMI or
USB a and or third-party ones that I
purchased at the same time as charging
the device and at least it's got you
know a headphone microphone combo jack
butum but this is about as bare-bones as
it gets these days without being
unreasonable
IMO Acer does make up some ground and
then also loses some when we make our
way to the keyboard and trackpad the
Spector's trackpad is simply put too
small and the Swift 7s is especially by
comparison glorious the extra width adds
more convenience than I would have at
first expected and once I turned off
enhanced pointer precision which is
trashed by the way and turn down the
speed in Windows to a reasonable level I
was actually really impressed with it
the keyboard though is a bit more of a
mixed bag for me the keys
feel a bit spongy requiring a lot of
pressure to press down but without much
of a tactile feel though as far as
typing speed goes while I don't like
them they don't slow me down much so I
can't complain too much about that so
I'll complain about the lack of a
backlight instead I mean how many
fractions of a millimeter would that
have cost me here Acer no backlight
which brings us I guess finally then to
specs and performance eight gigs of ram
ddr3 ram by the way a 256 gig SATA 3 SSD
which was a noticeable downgrade
compared to HP's PCI Express based model
and for the CPU Acer has gone a very
interesting route here opting for a four
and a half watt intel you class
processor so I've got a core
I 5/7 Y 54 in mine instead of a normal
25 watt notebook chip but what does that
mean for performance then well looking
at a couple choice benchmarks here we're
going to be running anywhere from 25 to
35% slower than HP's beast but this
comes with an advantage too so let's get
into some of the more experienced you'll
stuff battery life for the Swift 7 is
great and while Cinebench certainly ran
slower it also ran without turning on
any kind of cooling fan and without
bringing the temperature of the bottom
of the unit above slightly warm to the
touch which is damn impressive
considering that it still has the power
to do the sorts of things that most
people are interested in doing on their
ultra portable notebooks like watching
movies on the very good Gorilla Glass 4
top 13.3 inch 1080p IPS display we're
using video chat applications to talk to
their friends over the Internet
that is provided their friends don't
mind the potato quality of the included
720p webcam and that they don't mind the
unexceptional speakers that manage to
make it to the 50 percent mark which is
good enough to watch a movie at home
with a little bit of ambient noise
without this subtle distortion setting
in the specter speakers are better
there's more good news though there's
nothing on this machine that I would
consider to be bloat other than maybe
the pre-installed office trial the
onboard
nu MIMO two-by-two AC Wi-Fi solution
manages easily in excess of 30 megabytes
per second sustained transfers on a wave
to AC access point and I found the side
positioned IO however scant more natural
to use than the ports on the butt of the
specter which means the conclusion
pretty much comes down to price here
sort of if you want the world's thinnest
or second thinnest notebook then at MSRP
the spectre is positioned as a more
premium product with faster performance
better i/o and subjectively more sex
appeal if you want to save a few bucks
and
dodge the screen wobble issues at the
expense of creature comforts like
keyboard backlighting swift 7 is your
go-to but bear in mind I said if you
want the world's thinnest notebook do
you I feel like it's become a bit of a
pissing contest at this point and I'd
like to see products built to target a
use case rather than a V height
measurement so let me know in the
comments if someone built a notebook
with a u processor with like the power
of the Swift 7 but twice as thick that
lasted for like two to three days of
continuous use on a single charge would
you be interested in that or tell me do
you think Acer nailed it I really really
would like to know here and you know
what else I want to know why aren't you
using tunnel bear you can try it for
free it's the simple VPN app that makes
it easy to browse privately and enjoy a
more open Internet so will tunnel bear
turned on which is as simple as
literally installing the program and
then clicking one switch boom your
connection gets encrypted and it appears
to the services and websites that you
use as though you are browsing from a
completely different countries you'd be
like yeah no I want to use web services
as though I'm an American whoo I can
watch whatever it is that Americans
watch on TV yeehaw there you go
Tunnel Bear is the solution to that and
like I said you can try it for free 500
megabytes of data for nothing
head over to the link in the video
description try it out and if you like
it you can get a year of unlimited data
for a very reasonable price even more
reasonable because you're going to save
10% by going to tunnel bear comm /l tt
that's right 10% off so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked you
know what to do but if it was awesome
get subscribed hit that like button or
check out the link to where to buy this
notebook at Amazon in the video
description also linked in the
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
totally join now that you're done doing
all that stuff you're probably wondering
what should I watch next
great question check out that little
button in the top right corner to see
our latest video over on Channel
