amazing as Apple's inability to keep it
in stock anywhere in the appearance of
sealed units on eBay for greater than
retail price would indicate or is it a
colossal failure and only worthy of
being burned with fire or given my usual
water treatment well one or both of
those things is definitely coming so get
subscribed now if you aren't already
Kingston kc3 ten series business great
SSDs feature firmware based power loss
protection massive capacities and
performance to spare in fact we're using
them for our new production server click
right here to learn more about them this
video promised to be one of the easiest
that I'd ever written and yet it ended
up being one of the most difficult I
thought it would be easy because I
summed up with the help of our buddy
John Breton jure from TechnoBuffalo my
thoughts on the thing over two months
ago and figured I could pretty much
point vaguely to my left and say
basically that but it was difficult
because now that I've actually been
hands-on and using it as a daily driver
I'm finding the 12 inch retina macbook
early 2015 edition whatever it's called
man I hate their naming scheme a little
bit more difficult to hate a little on
the top of the unit under our protective
D brand vinyl wrap is a plain blasted
anodized aluminum finish with an Apple
logo square in the middle on the bottom
is more plain aluminum and I guess this
would be a good time to point out that
it can be silver gold or Space Gray with
some assembly screws and four black feet
that are surprisingly non grippy making
it easy to slide around on the desk then
on the sides we find one of the main
sources of the controversy that exists
around this product a three-and-a-half
millimeter combo audio jack on the right
and a single tiny USB type-c connector
on the left that's it so out of the box
you are expected to use the built-in
wireless AC 867 megabit bluetooth or
that USB port so it better be one
special USB port then right well
actually it kind of is so for starters
and this is important it is not a USB
3.1 10 gigabit port rather it runs at
the older USB 3.0 five gigabit speed but
because it uses the type-c connector it
gets some extra fancy functionality
number one is power it can both deliver
more power than a standard USB 3.0
type-a port and it can receive power to
charge your notebook which is good
because it's you're not getting power
from anywhere
number two is alternate modes which use
auxiliary pins in the type-c connector
to enable extra functionality like HDMI
or DisplayPort video output with more
fancy adapters soon to come
but Linus you might say I wouldn't have
needed any of that adapter stuff if I
just had a Meg safe power connector and
a couple of normal ports on it lenovo
and a soos managed devices this then
without removing all the ports why
couldn't Apple do that great question
moving on the MacBook has a silky-smooth
I'll be it a little bit flimsy feeling
one finger hinge that opens to reveal
some of the actually more interesting
things that Apple has done under the
hood I'll start with the webcam it's a
piece of crap and I'd say apples design
team should be embarrassed but this is
the same company that put a microphone
on the back of an all-in-one PC so I
guess anything goes around there so
let's move on to the display why is it
that Apple is the only one willing to
buck the industry 16 by 9 aspect ratio
trend and put a 16 by 10 display on
smaller devices where that extra
vertical space is a freaking godsend
Thank You Apple for the bright beautiful
23:04 by 1440 stunner of an IPS monitor
that you've crammed into this device
since I use a razor blade 14 as my daily
driver I instantly started swiping
around on it only to realize that Apple
still thinks a fraction of a millimeter
is more important than a touchscreen so
the rules are similar to the local strip
club but hey it's better than a pickle
and Ice Cream Sandwich and I'll take it
under the screen are the surprisingly
not horrible speakers most devices the
spinner basically unlistenable and will
actually cause vibrating distortion when
turned up to the max but while I didn't
experience any thunderous bass while
watching the Avengers age of Ultron
trailer the experience was actually not
too shabby which leads us finally to the
meat and potatoes at any notebook video
what's it like to actually use the thing
well the story starts before the device
was even shipped Wendy brand
thoughtfully offered to preload Windows
for me I told them not don't worry about
it it's okay to which they replied are
you sure you'll need the type C breakout
adapter from Apple which is out
stocke and the USB hub just to plug in
the to flash drives required for the
boot camp setup process yeah and that's
really the experience in a nutshell want
to do casual things like watching HD
YouTube videos around the house willing
to use another separate computer every
time you want to plug in a mouse or
transfer files off your camera great
experience want to do any kind of power
user stuff on the go although that stuff
I just mentioned hardly feels power user
to me by something else because you'll
either be carting around adapters that
negate the ease-of-use benefits of a
thin light or you'll be constantly
frustrated but while it's easy to hate
on and the lack of ports all but
eliminates this MacBook as an option for
someone like me there were some things I
really liked about the device the haptic
feedback touch pad and keyboard both
very controversial design choices stood
out to me actually is a step in the
right direction I'll start with the
touchpad instead of a hinge at the top
and a mechanical downward movement to
make it click to save space that Apple
assures us was used to cram in more
batteries for that nine hours of web
browsing per charge the entire surface
of the spacious blast topped capacitive
touch pad is pressure sensitive and
vibrates when you press a little bit to
simulate a click then again with an
adjustable pressure threshold in
software when you press harder it's
awesome this isn't your dad's haptic
feedback that makes the whole device
shake and sounds like it's going to fall
apart it's incredibly subtle and I'm
willing to bet that if you didn't tell
your mom that the touchpad doesn't
actually press down she would swear that
it was moving down and on top of that
it's really useful since there's no
driver support in Windows for the
feature not to mention the annoying
delays on double touch to drag I had to
fire up OS 10 which thankfully I
somewhat know how to use thanks to this
video series where it does loads of cool
stuff like allowing quick renaming of
files and folders file previews getting
shipment details when you force touch a
tracking number previewing links in your
browser and much more paradigm-shifting
I wish it was more customizable but who
knows maybe that's to come then again it
is Apple
the keyboard though is one that many
more people are raising hell about and I
get it
apples butterfly switch another
space-saving feature does not have the
same satisfying tactile feedback of a
mechanical switch or even a half-decent
scissor switch but I have to give them
credit here I may not enjoy the typing
experience and I don't but if I evaluate
it objectively then all I can say is
this unlike a soos they squeezed an
ambient light sensitive backlight in
there like Microsoft's original touch
cover it's extraordinarily slim and
without practice
I am similarly fast with a similar
number of errors compared to my razor
blade that's being impressive which I
guess lands us at the conclusion for
this video where I usually try to
summarize what the product is and who
it's for so that'll take a bit longer
than usual because those answers are
anything but simple here what is it on
the surface it appears to be a MacBook
Air usurper with no i/o that Apple is
cramming down our throats by refusing to
modernize the air with a decent screen
and storage but if we dig a little
deeper and look at that tiny basically
iPad sized PCB that Apple is bragging
about we discover what it really is a
tablet whose touchscreen was stolen and
replaced with a keyboard cover while it
wasn't looking making it a
proof-of-concept product for two things
at least two things number one the
rumored upcoming Apple's CPU if a Core M
can power a hyper mobile Yosemite
experience then I wouldn't be surprised
to see an a 10 or a 11 chip do that in a
couple of years and number 2 USB type-c
since it gives Apple a chance to ship
this undoubtedly thoroughly validated
but not yet field tested connector in a
relatively low volume product before
they risk deploying tens of millions of
phones and tablets in the upcoming
refresh only to discover that it caused
all kinds of problems and as usual the
what is it goes a long way towards
helping us answer who is it for not me
that's for sure as much as I absolutely
love the battery life and I can't help
but feel just a little bit cooler when I
whip it out
start typing away at the airport I've
got to do and you'd have a much easier
time selling me an error with a decent
screen thanks to its much more powerful
hardware not to mention the unassailably
technologically superior Thunderbolt and
Meg safe power connector combo whose
benefits range from additional speed and
device daisy-chaining to the fact that
some asshole and Starbucks isn't going
to trip on your cable pulling your
thousand dollar computer off the table
right as you were about to say that
latte powered novel you've been working
on in fact the only downside is that
Thunderbolt stuff like docks is
generally more expensive than USB stuff
but on top of the MacBooks inexplicably
large price premium compared to similar
devices like the Asus Zenbook ux302
wants $80 for a frakking USB breakout
dongle anyway negating a lot of the cost
savings but I told myself this wasn't
going to turn into a rant so I won't do
that and I'll just do a snappy ending
line like so if Apple wants your devices
to reflect who you are as a person then
I guess if you bought a macbook 12 inch
late 2015 retina you're the kind of
person who's not in a hurry and even if
you were you don't have anything
particularly important to do but you
need to do it for a long time in between
charges and look really cool while you
do it
speaking of looking cool King's mobile
network supports the iPhone 6 and 6-plus
so you can look cool while talking on
your phone without paying more and then
you have to there the mobile carrier
that's focused on customer service and
customer satisfaction which means when
you call them you don't talk to a robot
you get through directly to a person you
also pay for only what you use with the
average tingle at about 24 months 24
months 24 dollars per month per device
if you're stuck in a contracting will
cover up to 25% of your cancellation fee
up to $75 and if you head over to Linus
ENCOM and try out their savings
calculator and sign up you'll get $25 in
service credit or towards a new device
so check that out now so I think that's
pretty much it guys thanks for watching
