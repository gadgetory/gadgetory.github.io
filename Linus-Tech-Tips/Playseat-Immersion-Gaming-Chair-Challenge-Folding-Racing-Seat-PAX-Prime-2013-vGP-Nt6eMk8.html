brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries play seat you may know
them as the makers of fine racing chairs
or flight sim chairs but what you
probably don't know them for is the
makers of more like a media chair or
something that looks great in your
living room and is also designed for
gaming so this my friends is the first
prototype of the immersion so this was
built for e3 and is being shown off for
the second time here at PAX Prime in
order to get user feedback from real
gamers it is designed to be extremely
comfortable but you're still gonna have
those place heat features that you've
come to expect so there are two
mid-range speakers built into the
headrest up here as well as a 5 watt
subwoofer that is built into the base of
the seat that's gonna give you both an
auditory experience and a sort of you
know a tactile vibrational bum
experience that really I think is is
helpful when you're trying to have an
explosive sort of thing going on and you
can really feel it instead of just
hearing it on the side here is the
control panel so it's got support for
both analog in and Bluetooth in so you
can't just use it with your games you
can also use it with something like an
Apple TV that is able to be Mario over
Bluetooth there's also a pass-through so
you can opt to not use the built-in
speakers and use your headphones instead
and because they're taking user feedback
they're looking at the possibility of
adding even more features such as oh I
don't know say a USB port on the side
because you're already powering the
thing anyway so that way you could
charge your controller or your
smartphone or whatever else you might
want while you're sitting in your gaming
chair the construction is obviously not
final but we're expecting it to have an
adjustable headrest so right now it's a
very very very prototype but don't worry
that'll stay in place once the final
product is completed and right now
there's not really much range of motion
for tilting back but
something that they are taking the
feedback from gamers very seriously and
looking into implementing as well the
thing that I like about this is that
unlike that chair which is awesome and
super cool and amazing this one is one
that I don't have to think about do I
need to put this away when the relatives
are coming so that there's room for
everyone to sit anyone can sit in this
not just a gamer so if you don't have
the space to store something like that
or you don't have the room for it you
could just have living-room furniture
that is play seat immersions
and no one would be any of the wiser if
you unplugged them when they came over
so no one trips on the cables or
anything expected MSRP is around $5.99
and when you consider what a nice living
room chair costs starting to look pretty
good but what if you wanted a racing
seat you just want a racing seat it's
not okay to have a gaming seat that you
play with with a controller and you want
a steering wheel and foot pedals and all
those things this is still pretty new
this was released in spring this year
and I'm gonna have my lovely assistant
Kelly Jeffrey say hi hello thank you
that's awesome you're incredible fold
this up and show us how it can be stored
in a closet or somewhere out of the way
if you don't necessarily want to have a
rigid metal structure sitting in the
middle of your living room or in your
gaming den or wherever else the case may
be so just like that this is the
challenge it folds up and that is pretty
darn innovative guys thank you so much
don't miss any of our PAX Prime coverage
our trip to the show here is covered by
Western Digital Intel and steel series

this possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
