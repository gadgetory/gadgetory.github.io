present this product or at least the
concept of it with an award before I
even open it this gets the award for
being the coolest product I think I have
ever had the pleasure to check out that
came in a white box okay actually no
it's actually really looks really cool
basically what this is this is the wow
keys and is made for the ipod or iphone
you use it in order to be a keyboard for
well yeah okay your PC your Mac it's a
very expensive pc or mac keyboard but
you can use it as a keyboard for your
iPod or your iPhone but wait there's
more okay let's go on to the back here
you can see the basic layout of the
keyboard it's a very very clean layout
no number pad no nothing like that okay
we've got hot keys including pc / iphone
mode home search play pause next track
display on off all that good stuff
specifications okay the key technology
is Penta graph scissor keys it works on
Windows OS Mac OS and iOS four point X
alright cable laying with operating life
cycle these 10 million G light cycles
okay features keyboard okay keyboard for
PC map mode switch between pc and iphone
synchronization with itunes hotkeys for
ipod and I phone okay so this is all
cool this is all cool let's open it up
and then I'm going to explain why this
is so cool this is the ultimate media pc
keyboard ultimate i'm going to go as far
as to say that yes I did why is it the
ultimate you might ask because it comes
with this piece of styrofoam styrene
styro package whatever no that's not why
because
you can use it okay let's let's get rid
of the you know fake iphone you put real
iphone one here all right there we go
just like that you can use it in order
to type emails on your iPhone okay so
let's say you're here let's get the Box
anyway doesn't come with any drivers
that's good driverless okay so you can
use it to different purposes you can
type emails on your iPhone while you're
using it so here we'll turn this on ok
you know maybe I want to you know
whatever the case may be yellow hmm
interesting apparently it's not
optimized for my iphone I wonder if it's
working already okay give me a minute
let's see if we can try this up right
away so I've got the Omni oh wow keys
plugged in via USB now so it does need
power okay and then what I've done with
it is I've also put my phone in it says
the application is not installed this
accessory requires an app that you have
not installed would you like to install
it from the App Store yes i would so
i'll install the app and then i'll be
back in a moment well turns out it was
pebkac basically all i had to do to get
it working properly was press this
button so you can see clearly here when
i go into my notes and i try to type
something nothing happens if I do this
all of a sudden I can type quickly on my
iPhone Wow keys oh no I missed the
backspace okay the backspace isn't very
conveniently located overall I'd say the
layout is anywhere between good and very
good because you can see I do have my
shift keys in the proper locations from
time to time you see the shift key
shorten that's terrible for people small
hands like me the enter key is also
properly um here as opposed to being a
shortened enter or like a tall enter
like that haven't really looked at the
slashes slashes look okay page up and
page down far more important than home
and end probably for use on a mobile
device so those are very conveniently
located as well backspace yeah you know
what that's the one that
would probably like to see moved I'd
like the backspace here and then the
home here in fact that makes perfect so
why did they even do it this way you got
n page down page up home when you put
your backspace there how complicated is
that you've also gotta delete key up
here very handy as well you've also got
a dedicated play button so I'm going
gone ahead and turned on my Rihanna you
can turn up the volume turn down the
volume turn off the volume turn the
volume back on I don't know what this
button oh okay you can turn your virtual
keyboard on or off like if you actually
wanted to use this and you could ah you
can mock it unlock it cool switch
between iPhone and PC mode I don't know
what this does okay that apparently
locks it as well cool okay so we're
going to go ahead and turn that off okay
this takes us back to the so this is our
home button ok so then from there we can
you know navigate back into our notes
where we are making notes making more
notes it's actually a very comfortable
okay I'm making a lot of mistakes but
it's my fault not the keyboards fault oh
I don't like that backspace key so it's
a pretty comfortable keyboard the
overall quality of the unit feels quite
good you can see there's a little bit of
flex to the unit but that's partly due
to the plastic construction which you're
not going to get something as
lightweight as this without using
plastic construction and it's not going
to be comfortable to sit on the couch
with it on your lap if it's not made of
plastic so here's what it's really for
from my perspective okay you do need
third-party apps to make it do this so
we're going to go ahead we're going to
use the the wow keys in order to
navigate here I'm just going to go into
the App Store where I already loaded up
the app that is really to me the killer
app so for two bucks you already spent a
hundred dollars on the keyboard what's
another two box so you can get mobile
mouse pro what that does is it turns
your iphone into a trackpad you install
the desktop application on your pc
whether it's
mac or a pc and then all of a sudden you
sit with this on your lap on the couch
you control your media center by using
this as a touchpad and you got a
keyboard like wow awesome solution right
and you don't actually need to have data
on the USB so if you have one of those
little mobile USB guys with the
batteries inside you can just plug it
into that and that's your power so the
entire thing is wirelessly communicating
with your pc and then communicating via
the dock with your iphone looks like my
iphone is also charging so it does
operate as as a phone charger the other
app that is kind of a killer app but not
to me as useful as the mobile mouse one
is the touch pad one or the number pad
one so then you have a full keyboard and
a number pad if for whatever reason you
wanted to enter numbers into something
so that's fully pc kind not compatible
bear that in mind as well i am plugged
into a pc right now if i go ahead and I
switch to PC mode let's go ahead and
open up this in theory it should work in
I actually press the HOME key again see
that's uh in theory it come on in theory
it works okay so there we go it does
work just my pet kak and I think that's
pretty much all i wanted to say about
the omni oh wow piece of really cool
little device thank you for checking
