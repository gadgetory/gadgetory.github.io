recipe well it's a new configuration is
gonna get spicy of this generation it
will get spicy savage jerky that's a
spoiler alert huh so yeah welcome to the
wine show this week
hosted by Riley and James yeah ever
before seen unfortunately jesus take the
wheel I mean I'm in charge of running
the intro and everything first time ever
I'm big trouble it's gonna be a good
show we got a lots of cool news like
discord launching its own game store
trying to be all steamy and new leaks
about the Google pixel 3 are you as
excited as last year yeah and not only
that but also be careful about what
laptop charger they use because it could
destroy your laptop and also another
useless augmented reality headset don't
call it that Roley intro BAM
yeah Wow
little people they represent us today
little full of himself
sevens jerky yep yeah reshma FreshBooks
my favorite fortnight heck
okay all right okay we'll get there I
guess download fortnight I mean don't I
mean do it yes do now get out get out
now okay I'm only here because lioness
and Luc are not available it's not
because this is a permanent thing for
everyone who's like I get Riley out of
there we just wanted to make that clear
okay
so so Landro equals James if not Linus
or Luke hmm you're putting Wang Cho
Equalization James and Reilly when when
not you know Luke when not equal Linus
and Luke or there's an X or views all
right sure I don't know equation talk
it's programming I bro I'm an artsy guy
I know about numbers I'm a psychologist
dammit I said I took psychology
psychology degrees alright well let's
start talking about this game stuff then
psych man mr. scientist discord
they got a big beta coming out part of
that beta is a game store yeah this is a
this is a huge deal this is actually the
thumbnail story on net linked earned
food tech linked today represent steam
came out and was like hey we're gonna
copy dis cords chaps chat services they
got like the chat rooms and everything
in steam now so dis card was like oh
yeah oh yeah you want to have just one
product let's just be good let's just
make there just be one product yeah one
copy a prod no it's a little different
because obviously I think it's a lot
easier for steam to copy chat features
than it is for a chat platform to copy a
library because steam is like a it's a
giant network at the library of games
that's way harder to implement yeah I
mean so ok though to be fair looks like
go through
what is actually happening so they're
rolling out this beta to 50,000 Canadian
players they'll see well let me stop you
right there okay
I had to Google if these guys are if it
is a Canadian company is discord
Canadian I didn't look it up either I
try I didn't find anything I think it
would jump out if they were I'm just
assuming they're American so why are
they releasing the Canadian players I
don't is discord Canadian does anyone in
the chat ride that I went to their
Wikipedia the whitby didn't even say
where they were incorporated or anything
anyone the Chad know if dis cords
Canadian I guess yes and this guy says
disco is American oh they're American no
based in California people are saying
yeah but that the San Francisco okay so
they just like seem really they're just
like oh we love Canada something
technical they gotta look look it's a
long time coming all right we never get
anything first and this is we deserve
this I think yes we're so nice all the
time for all the times that you watch a
keynote and they're like and we didn't
stop there
this is rolling out today today
two three states yeah oh the worst is
when it goes to the UK in Australia
before Canada ah we're right here it's
the French that hold this boy what was
that dennis is laughing at us
go away Dennis yeah jeez so I like us
too
Dennis I'm so famous so they're doing
two things to be fair so it's like it's
it's a discord store where they're going
to have curated games so not like you're
a list of games yeah yeah it's not gonna
be like all the big EA games all the big
Ubisoft game it's like kind of more
indie stuff like dead cells is on there
I think Frost punk some of those like
popular games but not huge so they're
gonna have that store it's supposed to
be like really personalized like when
you click on it there's a little
description of the game that's written
by a employee of discs or that kind of
gives their own little that like this
game right who it's like artisanal yes
artisanal games oh yeah that's it
this was handcrafted by tiny children in
Venice when I was just a boy many hours
okay use that there's that and then they
also are ad
like a subscription game type thing like
a Netflix for games type service to
nitro nitro which is a is their already
existing subscription service yeah so
nitro is just basically a way for people
to just support discord and like donate
to them it's kind of like patreon
you're mostly there to give them money
but in exchange you get some perks like
being able to have a video or gif as
your avatar and stuff like that and this
new Netflix of games is it's just
another perk really right it's a pretty
be a perk yeah I think it's not bad it
simba do you even play games
Amba like NBA and balanced in in by NBA
i do play games i play games no I do but
I've never I've never encountered that
before I mean I'm not like super maybe
it's an RTS thing no it's a shooter am I
am i full for now knowing what in boo me
I drop oh I know Opie
I know nerfing in buzz like the opposite
of nerfing when something's in BA it
gets nerve so P overpowered you well
like okay it's more genius more yeah
you're correct about that
it's like Riley is a what girl what's
league ma see what is Impa people I
think Opie is Mark who's the gamer boy
now Oh gamer boys and girls sound off
alright one thing that they're gonna
have is first on discord games so these
are gonna be indie games that discord
helps develop they have some kind of
stake in them and then they're gonna
pure on the discord game store first but
for 90 days usually before getting wider
release to all the other platforms
everything I've got
so that's kind of cool they're like kind
of incubating some indie games that
maybe we wouldn't have as much of it
yeah yeah an initial reach yeah sounds
like they wanna they want to get some of
that sweet steam ask money that game
store money but they also want to
differentiate their service by you know
being high-touch right artisanal artisan
hunter i don't know how to say it
artisanal are disabled its artisanal
that sounds wrong
and it feels so good okay so they're
also doing because discord is kind of
one of the things like and this is an
indicator of this one of the things that
discord it seems to have been trying to
do is kind of be the hub for like PC
gamers like hey it shows what your
friends are playing it has all these
chat rooms that you might be interested
in you can like play music on there and
people know what their what you're
playing in stuff so they want to be like
the one-stop shop you go to you turn on
your PC you're gonna do some gaming you
open discord and this thing is leaning
towards that they're adding a universal
library so I want you to launch your
games through Steam now even that is a
crucial first through discord now how
annoying is that to have to open up epic
games launcher origin steam like a
different launcher battlenet just to
launch whatever game you want to play at
that moment so this is this chords gonna
have a feature where it can scan your PC
if you let it to detect all the games
that you have installed and then you can
launch them from the discord thing what
its gonna do is it'll launch steam and
then launch the yeah yeah yeah but at
least this is one thing to click on at
least you can have your I mean I think
the windows how it tries to do that with
like the Xbox app I think you can do
that in the Xbox app that's built in but
no one wants to use that because its
Xbox hmm so good luck discord power to
you be better than Microsoft cheers
Cheers
cheers bud this one's for you yeah
thanks John Orr's for posting this by
the way there's the forum post don't
know yet all this stuff comes from the
forum love you John errs yes so also
well I can't put as a sub story for that
call itself 76 won't be on Steam but
maybe that that doesn't really fit in
there okay so what's going on with the
pixel 3 leaks it's been ongoing yeah
they've been well it's kind of like the
man it's kind of like the Nvidia leaks
right now like it's just so irritating
how many of they are especially for you
and I who like are going through all of
the tech news like we go through every
tech news story basically and trying to
find the ones we need to talk about and
there's like Google pixel leaks Nvidia
leaks every other story it's like stop
and the most annoying thing is knowing
how they very week-to-week because the
nature of publishing online is like well
I need to write 15 articles today so any
tiny mind you change in the state of
things is worth a new article so even if
it doesn't give you new information like
let's say this week we learned there's a
notch or there's a leak that there's a
knotch
and then next week oh now it's confirmed
that there's a notch well we already
knew there was gonna be a notch but now
it's like more official man I hate the
notch I first notes that I wrote in here
are wires why is there a notch it
literally says why is the notch so big
that's the only that's the talking why
are not just a thing I really because so
we've only seen the Google pixel three
excels basically okay so what have we
seen it's all glass there's no headphone
jack to front-facing cameras because of
the notch obviously one front
rear-facing back camera not to like
every other phone right also they want
boki on the front yeah but not on the
back and they'll just use a yeah they
also got the fingerprint reader on the
back it's got twenty nine sixty five
forty forty display four gigs of RAM and
most likely a snapdragon 845 I would
hope so
that's not confirmed yet and then also
in the leaks that we made do you want to
bring them up do you want me to click on
that will do you bring things up yeah we
bring stuff up do you bring things up so
people can look at you what do you want
me to bring up I've seen on the ours
article or you posted these yeah there's
one man boom yeah just give him give him
a little some some here it is people
yeah screen we saw so for the people
talking about case labs we did just see
that like literally as we sat down so we
don't really have any details of that
but we'll we will talk about it in at
some point all right let's look through
this little slideshow yeah someone's
like no 3.5 millimeter jack and a notch
count me out tell me you can say you can
say that again big guy
good no I'm actually more angry I don't
mind the notch I'm more angry about
headphone jack and you see the thing is
see this is like everything that I don't
want in a phone
I want a headphone jack I don't want a
notch do you want the front firing dual
stereo speakers oh yeah cuz
that's what a lot of people say they
like I don't care both in bezels give me
speakers on the front pointing at me and
I don't care about that I don't give a
rat's patootie about the speakers on the
front guys I don't the best speakers you
could ever put in a phone are still
gonna suck
are you using headphones I think it's
obnoxious when people are in public
listening to stings on their phone
that's very I hate it even one of my
wife's phone makes noise because she's
watching a snapchat or something I'm
just like I just hate it yeah I'm never
using those speakers that's true I used
to I think that was like I think one
company put it on HTC I think with one
of their one phones like the m6 or m7 or
something had front-facing speakers and
everyone was like oh they're so cool
blah so then since then people have been
like Oh front-facing speakers are a good
thing but I've I'm with you man screw
that I think it's like people like it on
paper or something like that it makes
them feel more techie or something I
don't know I want no bezels I want the
full screen now the question I don't
care about that either it just looks so
much crap I'm really like I don't care
what my phone looks like I'm gonna slap
a case on it either way so see I run
nude oh really
totally new the first thing I do every
time I get a phone is I buy an otterbox
or something spike in there I don't know
I'd used to do that and then I would I
would drop my phone tens of times a day
follow my pock when I'm on motorcycle
around a concrete all the time I'm
dropping it yeah that's what I do I
value to intentionally throw this around
yes cuz I can exactly if you get a new
phone it's gone good did it sweet baby
Jesus you crazy man if you get a new
phone and you're already gonna treat it
nicer because it's new yeah and you're
like okay it's naked I'm just gonna I'm
gonna treat it good I'm gonna make sure
every time I reach down to my pocket
that it's in the pocket before I let it
go you just you just get these new
habits I've dropped this thing like
twice and one of those times is because
I was in the movie theater and just fell
it in my pocket
since then I got a skin on it it's
grippier he I'm just okay this is like a
discussion for another time buy like
what's you know what's the point of not
putting a case on and then like it might
as well put a case on and avoid a future
where you know my phone
cracks and I have to get another phone
because I was I didn't want to spend 40
bucks it's not about the money it is the
bulk it just don't even have to spend 40
bucks you can go to the night market and
get one for like six dollars or
something anyways look okay stop stop it
so this one comes with well apparently
the leak there is pixel buds a USB so
that's like a appears to be a wired
version u.s. PC version of the pixel
like air the wireless pixel yeah that'll
be interesting I wonder if they're gonna
be capacitive capacitative capacitor
capacitive touch sensitive I want to be
you know like on the pixel buds you can
hold down on and he'll the Google system
very low latency that'd be great if they
had that included on these one thing
that I thought was interesting is the
there's a there's a d3 3p on the forums
put a video like a new video of the
pixel 3xl like just up just like just
now or a couple or an hour ago or
something and it shows that there's a
volume rocker and a power button on the
right side no buttons on the left side
so I don't know what they're wasting
that space maybe this is like a ninja
that homes before I don't know get that
pixel over here yeah well you I'm sure
you could still squeeze it right yeah
they're probably gonna have that
squeezable that's a pretty deep notch
but you know what so is the iPhone tens
hometowns a wider knotch than a lot of
the other Chinese phones I really hope
that pixel because I need a new phone
I'm still rocking a galaxy s6 here guys
and gals don't tell people that why you
do the student there that's why I can
throw it around also it's cuz it's got a
case and hoping it dries so I you know I
wanted to get the pixel to but it's that
you know they're releasing the new one
soon so I really hope that doesn't have
a knotch
you see I really want a pixel three
small version the regular one but it's
probably not gonna have an auction it's
gonna have two front facing speakers
instead of sweet bezels like the form
factor of the s9 like the edge display
it's very thin bezels on the top and
bottom that would be great if that was
just a pixel though I don't want to
Samsung can't even like I don't even
like them anyways you know what this is
not this is not important
is it we're done we're not even talking
about the the story anymore we're just
rambling we're just ranting okay well
that was the story rantings okay right
guys this is the ranch show on the last
the ranch show on the last one I think
Luke and mine is just like ranted for
like 10 minutes did they once someone
came up to me LT accent was like you
know what I like about you on the wine
shows you keep people on task on top
they're doing the opposite right well
I'm you might still be doing better than
- oh that's the other thing it's got
four gigs of RAM and people were like
four gigs isn't enough and 2018 for a
phone yeah bye applause this out though
it could be enough I have no idea
because I have a super old phone once
again so I guess what happened in the UK
they changed the law and it turns out
people were buying Internet and did you
skip one I rolled down yeah I'm not
talking with that right now why not I
don't want okay fine so there was a law
in the UK that if you were a provider of
internet you could advertise speeds that
were imperialistic best possible
scenario they were like as long as those
speeds were actually deliverable to 10%
of your user base you could advertise
them so you might be able to say like 17
megabits a second but only like most
people were getting 10 so the law
changed it was involved in like a suite
of laws that came into play like in May
but it's just I don't know some research
has been done recently to see how that
affected all the different providers
there and like twelve of the biggest
providers who are all just names have
never seen before
Zendesk I Plusnet I know about Skyy John
Lewis Broadband John Lewis British
subscribed out Jordan do with broadband
racist yeah I can do British we're not
going this isn't our car ride home we
can't talk about yeah so the the way
that the law change was instead of it is
instead of the advertised speed only
applying to at least 10% it has to be at
least 50% of users during peak times so
yeah a lot of them had to reduce their
advertised speeds by like forty or fifty
percent so now if it's if you advertise
17 megabit per second you have to
advertise
ten or eleven mm-hmm so like the the
speeds that they're advertising just
like drop ridiculously yeah like the
poster from last year's like all new
super LT for Jen blobbin forty one
percent drop on average like that's what
you're bringing to bring this thing up
no don't they want to see this
well it doesn't want to see what it's
not like a chart it's just like imbedded
in text I saw I saw a screenshot of like
the new use out it is of the new like
speeds and they're like ridiculous it's
like yes you sign up for our lowest here
and get like 10 megabits per second oh
my goodness well hmm hmm well hold on
let me personally ask this hmm so this
is why you don't bring up the things I'm
gonna say no just cuz it takes less
cognitive load there we go I'm okay I'm
really sorry that I said anything see
that's a big mistake this is bad this
isn't even the thing at all look at this
here's some stock photos she's like huh
is that slower faster anyways the good
thing about this is I hate when there's
things in your life that are like oh
yeah that's what it says but day to day
you don't get those speeds like oh
you're so naive you haven't you haven't
learned the ropes that right even though
it says 17 you're never gonna get that
no one gets that I hate that I hate that
stuff see if it like this what I'm
confused about because here in Canada I
signed up for a 30 well now I have 80
but when I said why okay so I have 88
NetID megabits per second down okay it's
nothing fancy but like when I do a speed
test if I don't get 76 at least I'm like
well thanks going on so how do these
people like advertise hey you can get 50
and they're really getting like 12 how
is that okay
yes that's what cuz there's a little
ostrich decided as it says like during
the deadest times it's like you're miles
per gallon on a highway with the wind at
your back it's like if no one else is
online and you've got a pure platinum
cable yeah hard line did you'll be good
straightest cable cable that's not
flexible
I I don't know how that I don't know how
I don't know technology man and all
right they were all but they deal is
that they were paying for that speed but
now they do they pay less now because no
no well the thing is it's all relative
anyway because it's all just based on
the competition there's also different
providers they're all probably providing
the same speeds at the lowest prices
they can yeah what are you laughing at
sorry somebody said Oh 80 mega but it's
not eighty eight megabits for a second I
have 80 and that's only after I got like
an upgrade offer I had 30 before and I
said 18 that's nothing fancy and then
people are like oh no fancy I'm sitting
here with ten and I'm like that also
sucks I'm really sorry yeah there's
someone in Korea it's like yeah equals
mc-squared dude we're flying over here
yeah we don't even use numbers I hear
that Korea is like crazy faster Internet
I get 171 okay what do you want some
money what do you want good for you yes
send somebody over here a boat yeah what
about us I'm sitting with point zero
five I'm really sorry about that I want
to know about this magic leap let me
tell you about magic leap James what's
your name James yeah that's it
is it a little background magic leap has
been teasing the sickest technology for
years oh my gosh you've got these videos
where you just put on these glasses and
suddenly you have the super
high-resolution mixed reality objects in
front of you like whales splashing let
us know in the chat if you saw any of
those like concept videos from like 2015
and stuff because they were ridiculous
like I there was the hype for this
company was through the roof the
investor commitment the billions of
dollars they earned and then in the
recent months they they teased an actual
physical implementation of like what
these things look like they have these
like steampunk look to them yeah I'm
gonna pull that up well they do still
they stood yeah they do still kind of
look like they're like a steampunk II
thing they got the really round lenses
and stuff hololens is like a vite i feel
like it lies to you a little bit less
than the hololens in terms of
design cuz hololens has the big visor
but really all you can see is like this
little rectangular area I mean that's
technically Hollow is it no but but
these ones at least are like okay look
this is what you're gonna be able to see
but even yeah they're like that but even
with this the the round area is only a
fraction or the it's only a fraction of
that round area that you can actually
see the hologram yeah yeah get out it's
still like a little this isn't you can
you can't see all of that it's like this
little it's like a little rectangular
area within the the circular area again
lame so yeah I've been following this
since 2014 that's basically our set yeah
all right they're really copying us I'm
getting out of here 2014 was the file it
up the old script that I did for the
NCIX new show to net-net linked okay I
did in 2014 that was when we reported on
it fall 2014 and like Google put 500
million dollars of funding into the
company and then over the years they got
more and more I think the their most
recent estimate like a year ago or
something was four point five billion
dollars was the estimated good law value
of this company so the hype was like
crazy and so oh and that's the other
thing they said they were using this
like light-filled tech that is not just
like putting light onto a screen they
said they were gonna shoot light
directly into your retinas yeah yeah
you-you-you saw that I like that you're
into that the Suns do I love that I love
light field tech it's like field tech
but light yeah but no that's not what it
is they come out with it it's basically
a hololens it's basically the same thing
the hololens
they released the magic leap one creator
edition it's like the developer version
$2295 which i think is not that far off
from what the hololens was wait release
the developer Google glass was 1500
right and I think hololens was around
there I did let me know in the chat if
you know how much hololens was that
remember but I know it was expensive
about Google in it tell me we don't I
haven't tried it but from the people who
have tried it on the Internet
it's wack well it's not terrible that's
the thing that's the thing that's
disappointing about it like if it was
like terrible terrible it would be like
oh look at that but it's like it's
basically like the hololens like people
were saying like it's maybe it's maybe a
little bit better than the hololens but
not much and then add on the fact that
they don't even have any of like the
software there for like because you know
hololens is they're trying to inc
integrate it into windows and stuff
right soft it's like software is their
thing yeah like on day one I can take my
Excel spreadsheet yeah but with my hands
like Tom Cruise's yeah I move it over
here and the only official experiences
available for this right now is all
right well the only ones that I found
there might be more but the only ones
that I found were like a cigarette I
thing all right plays sigur rós music
play that a couple times
the Icelandic band oh yeah Sega DOS
cigarillos I'm not gonna pretend to be
Icelandic but I've heard Icelandic
people say it see good los chicos
I'm just picturing you like you
basically have that's gotta be any
Icelandic people say gross gosh yeah you
try and turn it all the time no no no
it's dude no I'm trying to do like a
little bit like you know like Bjork is
burek Icelandic yeah she kind of has to
push like this it's like a little elf
that's kind of Dutch Seguros alright
anyways they have a cigarette experience
where it's like a music equalizer thank
not equalizer visualizer and then they
have like a project create which is like
it's like a it's like minecraft or like
these other you know those games that
are like let you make games in the game
Dreamz was one of them I think
you can play God yeah yeah basically so
they have that so you can like player
out of things you can bake castles
there's little Knights that are run
around you can like make like circuits
and stuff but like other than that
what's the point what's the point you
know well and you also have to wear a
little computer oh yeah the googles and

but fortnight they say your mom's video
game I mean it might be that if your mom
plays that's fine can I get the jerky
again there yes yes you may they're from
a lot spicier that I thought was now
wouldn't be the a week of tech news
without something from Elon Musk just
this week he may or may not have
manipulated stock markets yeah if he
goes to jail
and the stock price totally tanks you'll
know why so I didn't understand this
really so it's so he tweeted that he
might take Tesla private might might
take Tesla private funding securities
what he wrote right so wait do we need
to tell people private and public
companies mean I I don't really
understand that okay when you start a
company I mean I understand that you go
on the stock exchange basically it's
like anytime anyone starts a company
it's a private company it's owned by the
people who start the company and that's
it when they get really big it's usually
because they want to fundraise they make
the company public which means that
anyone can buy ownership of that company
that's what a share is so instead of me
and you owning James Reilly Corp
suddenly thousands of people can own it
and because they all buy pieces of it we
get a lot of money no I don't want other
people to share in the special
relationship you and I that's right
because if they do then you have you're
beholden to them so a public company
that has shareholders they have to serve
the shareholders the shareholders are
represented by the board and every week
the board is trying to make you hit
target so you can make more money for
the shareholders and all these annoying
things that are really bothering Elon
Musk so he would like to take Tesla back
from being public I think it's called a
leveraged buyout when you you were
public and then you're like no we're
just gonna buy all the shares back from
everybody and we'll be private again
just like SpaceX is yay so what he
claimed in this tweet was that hey guys
I found someone with enough money to buy
all the shares back from you at a proc
like a share price of $420 and at that
moment weirdest lady yeah am i right a
stock price at that time was only 340
bucks so if that news was true then that
means that the share I hold that's worth
$340 is soon gonna be worth $420 nice so
a lot of people were like whoa I need to
buy shares before that transaction
happens because I as long as I buy those
shares while they're worth less than
four hundred twenty bucks I'm gonna
profit but then once he tweets it the
shares go up and then it's too late
so if he makes a tweet like that he has
to there's the the sec
what are they called the securities
financial the Federal Communications
what what FCC no the SEC the Securities
Exchange Commission Commission Council
try them for it so you're allowed to say
that you're gonna do that as long as
it's true if he if he actually does have
a backer that was actually gonna follow
through they've they've been in talks
there's someone who has the money to do
this he's allowed to share that
information with shareholders he's even
allowed to tweet about it as long as he
tells the shareholders beforehand right
as long as that's all true cuz if it's
not true then obviously every other week
Elon could be like yeah someone's gonna
buy it for about six million dollars to
share and then the share goes in the
stock price at that point he's just
manipulating the markets yeah so after
you tweeted that now there's an
investigation into whether or not it's
true and you can tell from the stock
price right now that there's not a lot
of confidence that it is true because
when you first made the tweet we went
with $340 up to about $380
at which point my accounting friends
were like boot dude you should sell
right now if you have Tesla because
there's no way this is real and it's
just gonna crash and that's exactly what
happened it went up to 380 and now it's
back down to 350 because people think
he's just biessing and you didn't sell
well if I do have tests the stock oh you
can't tell people that you stole they'll
use that you sold it mm-hmm you can't
tell people I think I can tell people
you're giving me this look like you
can't tell people no you can tell people
do you guys wanna know I have some test
the stock it's not a lot it just because
my like Tesla fancy boy who's a stock
market guy over here okay here's the
thing I hated reading all the tech news
about all these my favorite companies
and they're doing cool things and the
stock prices going up and you're just
not a part of it right so it makes
everything's more fun when you're kind
of just a part of it and then you just
you just do stocks because you feel like
you're closer to mr. musk you're kind of
your role model maybe role model how do
you think Grimes feels about that
I like Grimes I've seen your life I've
support money a partner what I see her
life her name is she changed her name to
see like the letter like the light speed
of light constant
oh yeah so always a capital okay so do
you think well I hope that I hope that
he that he did let the shareholders know
because if he did isn't that is it how
big of a deal if it if they isn't gonna
be if they find out that he did like
screw up it's bad like if he just did it
just willy-nilly yeah it's pretty bad
not only is the sure prize the stock
price will tank top to sub three hundred
for sure I think you can like it's fraud
or something like that like he might
even go to jail
Elon Musk in jail Wow he'd find a way
he'd find a way out yeah the boring
company just digs him out
okay that's what the boring company is
for that you're gonna dig me out he
started it he started the boring company
cuz he knew he would pull something like
the tunnels gonna go from my cell
underwater to a floating autonomous
barge well I'll launch on a falcon heavy
to Mars they'll never catch me he'll go
from the real life Iron Man to like the
real-life supervillain I don't know
what's what's a supervillain version of
Iron Man Lex Luthor yeah there you go
losing his hair alright so do you think
he's he's not a dummy
he knows finance and stuff we may be
witnessing the birth of the first
real-life super villain that would be so
fitting because everyone thought he's
kind of like a superhero so he'd be like
this fallen angel typed oh my gosh well
buy stock now before I was he does seem
pretty unstable on Twitter sometimes
this is not what this podcast is about
he called that guy a pervy guy competi
dude that was the first time that like
keep your comments to yourself pedo dude
I was like Ilana what are you doing yeah
I felt like like a Padme he was breaking
my heart
Elon what stop you're breaking my heart
from my point of view that SEC is evil
I killed them Bezos I really wish I
think in the future we can use
blockchain technology to invest not only
in companies button people sorry
somebody
just put in the chat you are the chosen
man nice one okay sorry what if you can
invest in people that'd be so dope like
if everyone had their own crypto like
coins best in people
yeah like so okay so Yvonne you won't
guess with Grimes right he starts dating
Grimes yeah people are like whoa Grimes
value is about to go off like she's
trending I buy Grimes coin and then
every like Grimes was super popular
because she's now by proxy soup like
more famous than she was she gets like
record deals and TV deals so she's worth
more money so they're coin goes up and I
own that gram coin I don't want to live
in that world you're saying you wouldn't
buy james coin alright by james coin cuz
i laser coin i believe in you thank you
yeah
alright but I don't want to what'd you
call your coin putting you on the spot
here
compute compute Riley bucks good one I'm
not good with the with the puns as I've
just discovered after being here for
some time
what's this ROM thing ooh roms ooh I
know about those yeah pull it up I'm
gonna put up the forum thing Oh didn't
they do something like this and brought
black mayor they did with the do you
watch black I've seen every episode I
love the one where I'm it's Bryce Dallas
Hallett Howard and she's that's the
where you rate your friends on social
model one time season three that's big
well there's a season for are they're
forcing I think that's the first one
that was on Netflix a season three
that's a pretty good update there's no
investing in people in that but you do
like how many have ratings and you go up
and down and stuff yeah thank you the
Technicolor's for posting this to the
forum oh what the roms yeah I don't
where is it I'm C roms are Robb's over
is it a ROM pocalypse hmm she's I was a
pun I don't know what you're talking
about yet uh so do you guys know what
roms are they can trip you can't ever do
you so roms are basically like the game
file for games when you run in an
emulator so if you're running like a
game cube or a Wii emulator on your PC
the ROM is what you need to load in
there so you can play the game there are
all sorts of rom
on the web and they're in kind of like
oh that was a bad analogy to make but
they're under fire okay all right so
Nintendo just recently filed lawsuits
against two huge emulator sites love
retro and love roms we reported on this
in tech linked they sued them for a
hundred and fifty dollars per game 150
thousand dollars per game per game oh
and two million dollars per trade mark
oh like every so you like two million
dollars for Zelda no Smash Bros counts
as one covers all of them yeah no it
doesn't that's the thing so like I'm
just a massive amount of money we're
talking here - like independently run
websites by people who are just trying
to like keep these games alive right
like you download them for free I they
get ad probably revenue from like
hosting them and stuff but making money
for sure yeah they're making money on
this site but like you know they're not
making money on the games per se but
anyways so you please tell me that like
it's one thing to smash these people
into oblivion and offer an alternative
yeah but if you don't it's like when
they're yelling at people for torrenting
Game of Thrones but then there's no nice
way to watch Game of Thrones a
there wasn't exact for a while so you're
voted tell me that Nintendo has an
awesome store of classics well that's
the thing they haven't launched the
virtual for it so for a lot of their
consoles in the past they launched a
Virtual Console and you can just go on
there like for the Wii or the game
people want they don't have a better
GameCube but for the Wii U you go or the
Wii U go on there and then you go to the
Virtual Console and you can download all
of these old games and play old retro
games on your current console but they
haven't launched that for the switch yet
and there's a ton of things that aren't
on the Virtual Console so that's what
these ROM sites that's that's the
service they provide so the big news
here is that another site emu paradise
paradise for emulators not always the
bird okay that would be silly yeah they
just stopped they said they're gonna
stop hosting roms
so I guess maybe they'll still have
stuff about emulation I don't know I
don't know whether they're still like
continuing to go with just without rooms
or not but they're stopping
Hosting Rob's because I mean they didn't
say specifically that they're doing it
because of these lawsuits but the
implication shooting to oblivion
the implication is that they want to
avoid a similar fate so apparently they
were one of the few places on the
internet that were not plagued by popups
and glitches and all this stuff because
you can go and get roms on the internet
but you know we can't have nice things
there's no guarantee that the site
you're gonna go to isn't just like a
trap and it's like loading malware and
stuff nothing gold can stay didn't I
read that the Virtual Console on the
switch is in a cost money you read that
I think I read I haven't seen that
scrolled past that headline oh I think
it's gonna cost money well I mean you
buy the games okay I don't I didn't have
a Wii or Wii U
I actually would rather was a
subscription than buying the games I
think Haley put his input in the chat do
you know do you have to pay in previous
consoles to access the virtual console
I'm pretty sure you can you have to buy
the games on the Virtual Console okay in
order to play them so that's because
with old fans I'd rather I just try them
all I'd rather a subscription option cuz
I think some of them might suck and what
I'm playing for like we're on like the
old games on the virtual call like just
old super nintendo games stuff yeah see
for me I'm not like I didn't the first
the first console I had was an n64 so I
played very little of the NES and SNES s
Ness Ness yeah see now this is the thing
they don't have the Virtual Console but
they have the NES mini in the NES
classic edition or whatever that's NES
classic edition so are they gonna
release like the n64 classic edition
probably and so on and so I want a tiny
tiny GameCube mini estab disc would that
be okay though you know because I don't
want to buy that why okay if they
released an n64 mini and it was like a
little and I wanted to play in 64 games
yeah I would buy it but like most of the
time I feel like a lot of people are
running things you know they want to
have it up there for as
like a backup or because it's not
available on other services so like what
about old like what about Wii games that
you can't play on switch right now you
know like I don't know I think when
Nintendo should have before they do this
kind of stuff they should have some sort
of service yeah yeah well they I think
if they if they crush these sites before
the product launch then their product
launch is more compelling so oh this is
a good this is a good what's his name
Zr gaming just said in the chat I forgot
to mention this the NES mini the classic
editions that they launched actually
like they took some of them apart and
one of them was actually running like
hacked roms thank you whatever it takes
like it was like the Nintendo model and
it was like running an emulator and
Brahms just like so it's a little
hypocritical Nintendo huh okay so get
your get your stuff straight let's go
home
what is that it yeah one more thing I
wanted to say is Israel I'm a Malaysian
morally good morally is is objective
morality of physical truth I found the
morality there BAM well got it what what
and that's it there's no many more
there's no more topics that's it that's
