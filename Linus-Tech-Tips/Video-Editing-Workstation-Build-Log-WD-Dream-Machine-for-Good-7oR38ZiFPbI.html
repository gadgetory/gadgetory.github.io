wanted to come up with the perfect
symbol for how well we work together we
brainstormed and debated and eventually
we decided peanut butter and jelly
and I think we all knew how that was
going to end so we were on our way back
inside feeling dirty and a little
ashamed when we realized the answer was
staring us in the face all along we go
together like an SSD and a hard drive
the ultimate tag team all right
cheesy opening skit things a cheese Wow
no thank you
outside battle aside the point of
today's bill blog although this won't be
news to anyone who's been watching our
channel for the last couple of years is
some things like an SSD and a hard drive
are just better together so to educate
people about this idea of SSDs and hard
drives being a match made in heaven like
PB&amp;amp;J WD launched their dream machine for
good promotion on a couple of popular
online communities getting members of
abs forum and AV forum to submit their
ideas for a dream machine and then
giving us the opportunity to draw
configuration from the dozens of
submissions build it and donate it to a
local school to give the students their
the tools that they need to develop
their skills as videographers
photographers digital artists animators
you name it so we drew a skin sevens
configuration and today Luke and I are
going to build up that config that he or
she submitted with a couple of small
tweaks we upgraded the motherboard to an
X 99 deluxe due to availability of the
one that he selected askin sevens
configuration was definitely one of the
better balanced ones that struck a solid
middle ground between some of the other
configs that were either total dream
machines that only made sense in dreams
or super mundane rigs that wouldn't feel
like we were really building an ultimate
workstation for the students to use we
did end up making a couple of tweaks to
the config so the motherboard had to be
changed I mentioned that the four
terabyte WD green storage drive was
upgraded to two brand Spain
new six terabyte models courtesy of WD
for a total of 12 terabytes of storage
and the monitor was changed to a
personal favorite of mine the Asus PB
278 q because the one the post called
for was a little bit over the top for
our config I really liked the choice of
the define r5 for the case for a lot of
gamers something flashy R might have
made more sense but even though this is
definitely a capable machine for games I
mean it's got a GTX 980 in it the
intended use is in a classroom so it
should be extremely quiet and it
shouldn't look super flashy with side
panel windows and LED lights all over
the place I like the choice of the intel
core i7 5820k if this was a gaming rig I
might question the wisdom of spending
the extra money on six processing cores
and ddr4 versus a more practical quad
core ddr3 machine but since it's much
more likely to be used for content
creation than 3d games the extra couple
of processing cores will save a lot of
time in the long run for whoever is
using it 16 gigs of ram might not seem
like much right now but with the way
ddr4 is going to drop in price over the
next year or two it made sense to go
light on the ram and then upgrade it
later on down the road when the cost per
capacity is much lower and when you're
sure that the extra ram is actually
going to be used speaking of cost per
capacity our configuration includes a
512 gig 850 pro SSD and those to sixth
hour by WD green drives that I mentioned
before for mass storage the 850 Pro is
super fast and that's where we'll
install the Windows 8.1 operating system
but it's also a $500 drive for a mere
half a terabyte of storage not really an
appropriate price per gig for storing
large video files or anything else that
takes up a lot of space and doesn't
directly benefit from the faster random
reads and writes of an SSD so that's
where our hard drives come in each of
these six terabyte drives costs about
half as much as that single 512 gig SSD
for 12 times as much storage each so
about one-twentieth the cost per gig
overall actually a little bit less than
that so we'll store large programs here
and
they can also be divvied up amongst all
the different students who work on the
machine so that they all have enough
space to store their projects without
worrying about running out of room but
there are actually some little tricks to
help you get the most out of an SSD and
hard drive configuration so for those of
you at home changing your default
installation directory for programs like
Steam origin and you play to the hard
drive rather than to the SSD will save
you the trouble of changing it every
single time you can also change things
like your My Documents and my videos
folders to remap them to the hard drive
and then windows every time you go and
look for those folders will
automatically redirect you to your
master egde you can utilize programs
like space sniffer a personal favorite
to keep your SSD space freed up it gives
you a nice little visual representation
of everything that's on your SSD so you
can figure out what you need and what
you don't and another little tip is when
your defragging when you're running
regular system maintenance you do want
to defrag your hard drive in order to
get the sequential files as close
together to each other as you possibly
can versus having the little bit slim
scattered all over the place but never
defrag an SSD it's actually bad for it a
tip that's not specific to SSD and hard
drive dual Drive users is encrypting
your drives Windows security is pretty
easy to break but to protect your files
it's definitely worthwhile to encrypt
things and guys these are just a few of
the ways that you can keep your system
optimized if you have some specific
questions the best thing to do would be
to direct you to the Linus tech tips
forum thread linked in the video
description where you can actually ask
any specific questions you have about
how to make this process as seamless and
painless as possible
w DS planning to have some of their
technical folks in there answering
questions for the next couple of weeks
so whether you're still working on your
next system or you've already got a dual
Drive setup you can drop your questions
in there and they'll do their best to
answer you so check that out again it's
linked in the video description so
that's pretty much it for this build
blog thanks to ask m7 and the rest of
the folks who submitted PC configs for
us to potentially build thanks to you
guys for watching and thanks to WD for
letting us be involved in this fund
project guys like this video if you
liked it dislike it if you disliked it
leave a comment letting us know if you
have any sort of actually I mean a might
be a great place to also have some
discussion about your dual Drive setups
also check the other link in the video
description if you want to support us
you can buy a cool t-shirt like this one
you can give us a monthly contribution
or you can change your amazon bookmark
to one with our affiliate code so every
time you're buying SSDs and hard drives
we get a small kickback that kind of
thing helps us out a lot
thanks again for watching and as always
don't forget to subscribe
