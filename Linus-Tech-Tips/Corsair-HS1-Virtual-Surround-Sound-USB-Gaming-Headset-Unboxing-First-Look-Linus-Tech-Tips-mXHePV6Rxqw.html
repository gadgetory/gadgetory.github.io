product category from Corsair this is
from their gaming audio series which
until now didn't exist
it's the HS one which I'm going to go
ahead and guess stands for headset one
it is their first headset and it is a
USB gaming headset coronaries of course
a gaming oriented company so it stands
to reason they would want a gaming
headset you can see actually here on the
front it's got a little Dolby logo here
with a headphone on it so that's to
indicate that it does feature Dolby
headphone technology so you can enjoy
multi-channel games and movies in a way
that ordinary stereo headsets can't
match that means that this does support
7.1 Virtual Surround so even though it
only has two speakers it uses the
built-in digital decoder to actually
convert your USB port to the audio chip
built-in and then tape that digital
signal and turn it into an analog output
for your ears okay let's talk a little
bit about some of the other points while
we open up the box because that is what
I do I unbox products and since headsets
are a bit of a passion of mine I'm
actually going to test this one out
and I will let you know what I think
I'll either do it via annotations over
top of this unboxing or I will do a
separate review video but I've tinkered
around with most of the gaming headsets
from the key gaming peripheral companies
and I'm very interested to see how this
one stacks up especially because it's
the first one that's actually a
dedicated USB headset that I have had a
look at I mean I've used some of the
SteelSeries ones that are analog
headsets with little USB adapters but
yeah never one that's just purely USB so
it has massive 50 millimeter drivers
which is competitive with some of the
other high-end headsets on the market
right now and it is built for comfort
and I can already tell you that based on
the construction of it right here I
think that's pretty much all I wanted to
say about what is on the box so why
don't we go ahead and get started
removing it for
the packaging so first of all at the
back because it's a digital product and
it uses USB I'm gonna go ahead and
assume there's a driver CD in here stop
do not return this product to the store
contact Corsair support please disable
your antivirus software huh
there you go disable your antivirus
software while you install this product
and then we enable it apparently their
software it can be accidentally detected
as a virus so here's a quick start guide
shows you how to put a disc in your
computer it shows you how to use the
volume controls and whatnot Bob that was
it how the whole thing awesome
using the software ok allows you to
enable and configure dolby headphone and
Dolby Pro Logic 2x alright well that's
pretty much it LJN shouldn't throw this
away and download the latest from the
Corsair web site mind you this products
so new there probably aren't any driver
updates yet so it may actually be safe
to use an included driver disk for the
first time ever on Linus tech tips quite
heavy
which I guess is both good and bad
because heavy usually to me anyway
indicate some you know some actual
materials went into the construction but
on the other hand a heavy headset is you
know there's a fine line because you
don't want a headset that weighs like 30
pounds either that would get tiring fast
I'm still trying to figure out this box
because a professional unboxer so you
have the battery right now I know this
is a common occurrence on my blog anyway
like I was saying though I am a
professional unboxer I'm having quite a
bit of difficulty with this box because
it doesn't appear to come away come away
come apart in any straightforward matter
and that's making unboxing it a bit of a
challenge so as far as I can tell
there's a little door here ok so from
there I'm supposed to maybe pull out
these cables and then what then what
indeed maybe this comes off no don't
want to force it
okay well I'm gonna do something so I'm
doing something I rarely do and it was
completely destroying the box here there
seemed to be some perforations we did
were easily destroyed it's a very
strange box I've never seen one quite
like it so here we are this is the HS
one from Corsair the first thing I want
you to notice about it and because it's
the first thing I notice about it is
look how puffy the headband is it's
actually it's actually okay not only
very thick here you want to come in a
little bit closer don't you assume it's
better not to use that not only is it
very thick but you can see there's kind
of a very very soft foam like no matter
how lightly I press on this it easily
gives away and it's quite deep as well
so the hard part of the headband is
actually quite deep inside there and it
feels like that would be very
comfortable for extended gaming periods
up at the top is also puffy although
that I can't imagine would have any
effect on on comfort alright let's have
a look at the design of the headphones
themselves you can see they do fold up
so that would be helpful if you're
packing them up to take to a LAN or for
some other reason packing them up they
do swivel so they swivel this way okay
so that will give you some flexibility
if your head is shaped kinda like this
or like this or like this or you know if
your head shaped like this then you'll
also be able to wear the HS one quite
comfortably indeed these bra these
hinges right here look very robust so
you can see the construction in them
there they are plastic but you can see
they use quite thick plastic pieces in
their construction and I really can't
imagine you'd have much success breaking
these even if you tried there are many
metal elements to these as well which
would explain the considerable weight to
them so this is metal this is metal this
piece right here
hard to say cuz it's quite cold so it's
cold but it sounds like plastic so I'm
not really sure I'm like 99% sure these
are metal though okay just see so okay
you can see you've got a boom mic right
here so it goes all the way down this
way
and it's adjustable okay so it's not the
first time I've seen a design like that
but you can tuck it up out of the way
just like that all right
yeah uses one cord okay so it's a lot
more convenient than some headsets that
do use one cord to each earphone and
then but rather it has one cord and then
it goes up through the head piece and
then down to the other ear all right so
what can I go ahead and put these on and
then we can see what kind of a fashion
statement they are oh those are really
comfy actually those are nice so you got
some adjustments in here so if you have
kind of a taller head y-you see they're
actually very adjustable so even if I
had that much more like that much more
of a tall head I'd be able to wear these
quite comfortably and so yeah I mean I'm
gonna adjust them to more like smaller
head size right there so you can see
I've gone ahead and adjusted that out a
little bit and the ear cups are
absolutely huge so I don't know if you
can compare it to the size of my ears
here but it fits over very comfortably
even with my earrings on hanging down
below my ears so it doesn't put any
pressure on the earrings which is
actually kind of a nice thing based on
how much I can hear outside they're
fairly open although it's hard to say a
hundred percent for sure because I don't
know if I saw any notes on the box about
whether these aren't open or a closed
headset haha they're noise-isolating
okay so there they are gonna call these
closed but I can tell you one thing is
that the closed headphones I've used in
the past that have been more effective
at isolating noise don't use a foam
earpiece but they usually use like a
fake leather like a plethora material
and that will cause it to isolate the
sound a little bit better although one
advantage you do get from like a hybrid
design where it's using a closed ear cup
but then you've got a little bit of
sound leakage here is that you will
actually be able to hear people who are
talking to you in the same room a little
bit better although you will get a
little bit more sound leakage out from
the headphones to the people around you
we'll be able to hear what you're
listening to which should be fine as
long as it's nothing you know too
outlandish okay so you can see that's
where that makes it so it's a very
comfortable distance from my mouth
anyway and what's nice about it sitting
off to the side like this is that when I
breathe out when I talk it's not going
to have air brushing past the mic and
create that whooshing noise so it should
pick up the sound really well because of
the distance to my mouth but the fact
that it's not sitting right in front of
it means that it should be a more clear
sound so we'll have a look at the cord
itself it's a braided covered sleeve to
cord very very nice very tangle
resistant I mean you probably can't even
tie this in a knot if you try to I mean
maybe you could but it would come out
quite easily even if you did that so
that's a pretty good design feature and
then here we have a mute button audio
control these are nice big buttons so
they should be fairly easy to find
should you be concerned about how to
find them and then last but not least
there we go the the unique feature of
these headphones is that they are
entirely USB powered entirely USB driven
so what that means is that you don't
even need a sound card to use this
headset so that means if you have like a
laptop of crummy sound and let's face it
most laptops have crummy onboard sound
then this is a perfect solution because
you can go ahead and plug it into a USB
port and all the sound processing is
done up here so thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the hs1 once I have a
chance to play around with them a little
bit I will let you know my impressions
