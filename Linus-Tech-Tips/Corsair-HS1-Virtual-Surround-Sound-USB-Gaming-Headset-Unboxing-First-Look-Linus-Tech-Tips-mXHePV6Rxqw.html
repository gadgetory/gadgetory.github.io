product category from Corsair this is
from their gaming audio series which
until now didn't exist it's the HS 1
which I'm going to go ahead and guess
stands for a headset one it is their
first headset in it is a USB gaming
headset course areas of course a gaming
oriented companies so it stands to
reason they would want a gaming headset
you can see actually here on the front
it's got a little Dolby logo here with a
headphone on it so that's to indicate
that it does feature dolby headphone
technology so you can enjoy
multi-channel games and movies in a way
that ordinary stereo headsets can't
match that means that this does support
7.1 virtual surround so even though it
only has two speakers it uses the
built-in digital decoder to actually
convert your USB port to the audio chip
built in and then tape that digital
signal and turn it into an analog output
for your ears ok let's talk a little bit
about some of the other points while we
open up the box because that is what I
do i unbox products and since headsets
are a bit of a passion of mine I'm
actually going to test this one out and
I will let you know what I think I'll
either do it via annotations over top of
this unboxing or I will do a separate
review video but I've tinkered around
with most of the gaming headsets from
the key gaming peripheral companies and
I'm very interested to see how this one
stacks up especially because it's the
first one that's actually a dedicated
USB headset that I have had a look at I
mean I've used some of the steelseries
ones that are analog headsets with
little USB adapters but again everyone
that's just purely USB so it has massive
50 millimeter drivers which is
competitive with some of the other
high-end headsets on the market right
now and it is built for comfort and I
can already tell you that based on the
construction of it right here I think
that's pretty much all i wanted to say
about what is on the box so why don't we
go ahead and get started re moving it
for
the packaging so first of all at the
back because it's a digital product and
it uses USB I'm going to go ahead and
assume there's a driver CD in here stop
do not return this product to the store
contact course our support please
disable your antivirus software huh
there you go disable your antivirus
software while you've installed this
product and then we enable it apparently
their software can be accidentally
detected as a virus so here's a quick
start guide shows you how to put a disc
in your computer shows you how to use
the volume controls and what not wow
that was it how the whole thing awesome
using the software ok allows you to
enable and configure dolby headphone
adobe pro logic 2x alright well that's
pretty much it LG i mentioned throw this
away and download the latest from the
course our website mind you this product
so new there probably aren't any driver
updates yet so it may actually be safe
to use an included driver disk for the
first time ever on Linus tech tips hey
wow quite heavy which I guess is both
good and bad because heavy usually to me
anyway indicate some you know some
actual materials went into the
construction but on the other hand a
heavy headset is you know there's a fine
line because you don't want a headset
that weighs like 30 pounds either that
would get tiring fast I'm still trying
to figure out this box because a
professional inboxer um so yeah the
battery ran out I know this is a common
occurrence on my blog anyway like I was
saying though I am a professional
unboxed sir I'm having quite a bit of
difficulty with this box because it
doesn't appear to come away come away
come apart in any straightforward manner
and that's making unboxing it a bit of a
challenge so as far as I can tell
there's a little door here ok so from
there I'm supposed to maybe pull out
these cables and then
then what indeed maybe this comes off no
don't want to force it okay well I'm
going to do something so I'm doing
something I rarely do and it was
completely destroying the box here there
seem to be some perforations we did more
easily destroyed some very strange boxes
I've never seen one quite like it so
here we are this is the HS one from
Corsair the first thing I want you to
notice about it and because it's the
first thing I notice about it is look
how puffy the headband is its action
it's actually okay not only very thick
here you want to come in a little bit
closer don't use those it's better not
to use that um not only is it very thick
but you can see there's kind of a very
very soft foam like no matter how
lightly I press on this it easily gives
away and it's quite deep as well so the
hard part of the headband is actually
quite deep inside there and it feels
like that would be very comfortable for
extended gaming periods up at the top is
also puffy although that I can't imagine
would have any effect on on comfort
alright let's have a look at the design
of the headphones themselves you can see
they do fold up so that would be helpful
if you're packing them up to take to a
LAN or for some other reason packing
them up they do swivel so they swivel
this way okay so that will give you some
flexibility if your head is shaped kinda
like this or like this or like this or
you know if your head shaped like this
then you'll also be able to wear the HS
one quite comfortably indeed these bra
these hinges right here look very robust
so you can see the construction in them
there they are plastic but you can see
they use quite thick plastic pieces in
their construction I really can't
imagine you'd have much success breaking
these even if you tried there are many
metal elements to these as well which
would explain the considerable weight to
them so this is metal this is metal this
piece right here hard to say because
it's quite cold so it's cold but it
sounds like plastic so I'm not really
sure I'm like 99% sure these are metal
though
okay just see so okay you can see you've
got a boom mic right here so it goes all
the way down this way and it's
adjustable okay so it's not the first
time I've seen a design like that but
you can tuck it up out of the way just
like that all right it uses one cord
okay so it's a lot more convenient than
some headsets that do use one chord to
each ear phone and then but rather it
has one chord and then it goes up
through the head piece and then down to
the other ear alright so what can I go
ahead and put these on and then we can
see what kind of a fashion statement
they are all those are really comfy
actually those are nice so you've got
some adjustments in here so if you have
kind of a taller head why you can see
they're actually very adjustable so even
if I had that much more like that much
more of a tall head I'd be able to wear
these quite comfortably and so yeah I
mean I'm going to adjust them to more
like smaller head size right there so
you can see I've gone ahead and adjusted
that out a little bit and the ear cups
are absolutely huge so I don't know if
you can compare it to the size of my
ears here but it fits over very
comfortably even with my earrings on
hanging down below my ear so it doesn't
put any pressure on the earrings which
is actually kind of a nice thing based
on how much I can hear outside they're
fairly open although it's hard to say a
hundred percent for sure because I don't
know if I saw any notes on the box about
whether these aren't open or a closed
headset haha their noise isolating okay
so there they are going to call these
closed but I can tell you one thing is
that the closed headphones I've used in
the past that have been more effective
at isolating noise don't use a foam ear
piece but they usually use like a fake
leather like a plenary material and that
will cause it to isolate the sound a
little bit better although one advantage
you do get from like a hybrid design
where it's using a closed ear cup but
then you've got a little bit of sound
leakage here is that you will actually
be able to hear people who are talking
to you in the same
room a little bit better although you
will get a little bit more sound leakage
out from the headphones to the people
around you slip will be able to hear
what you're listening to which should be
fine as long as it's nothing you know
too outlandish okay so you can see
that's where that makes it so it's a
very comfortable distance from my mouth
anyway and what's nice about it sitting
off to the side like this is that when I
breathe out when I talk it's not going
to have air brushing past the mic and
create that whooshing noise so I should
pick up the sound really well because of
the distance to my mouth but the fact
that it's not sitting right in front of
it means that it should be a more clear
sound so we'll have a look at the cord
itself it's a braided covered sleeved
cord very very nice very tangled
resistant I mean you probably can't even
tie this in a knot if you try to I mean
maybe you could but it would come out
quite easily even if you did that so
that's pretty good design feature and
then here we have a mute button audio
control these are nice big buttons so
they should be fairly easy to find
should you be concerned about how to
find them and in then last but not least
there we go the the unique feature these
headphones is that they are entirely USB
powered entirely us be driven so what
that means is that you don't even need a
sound card to use this headset so that
means if you have like a laptop of
crummy sound and let's face it most
laptops have crummy onboard sound then
this is a perfect solution because you
can go ahead and plug it into a USB port
and all the sound processing is done up
here so thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the HS one once I have a
chance to play around with them a little
bit i will let you know my impressions
