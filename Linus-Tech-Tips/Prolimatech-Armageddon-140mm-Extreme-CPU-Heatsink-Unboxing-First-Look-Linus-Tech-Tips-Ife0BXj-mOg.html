operating the camera um henceforth
referred to as the cameraman since I'd
lack another nickname for someone
operating a camera so today we're going
to be unboxing the pro Lima tech
armageddon cpu cooler this is for socket
1366 and 1156 motherboards it's without
sacrificing space i'm not sure exactly
what that means but it comes with
100-percent Braun I actually saw this
package on our shelf and I was like yeah
I gotta unbox that because it is an
exceptionally cool package they've got
their armageddon branding here with
their flames coming off of it and then
they've got their silvery kind of shiny
logo on here it looks really cool it
kind of looks like a smiling guy like
there's his unibrow and there's his eyes
and nose and mouth and then you pull
this off somehow it actually has
instructions here so you flip and lift
so why don't we do that actually let us
have a quick look at the specs first so
we've got the heatsink dimensions here
which you can probably read as long as
the camera is focusing all right today
it comes with aluminum fins lead-free
solder on all the contact points it's
made of copper for the heat pipes and
base and it is nickel plated on the heat
pipes and base and then the fins are
aluminum so they don't need to be nickel
plated it weighs 750 grams without a fan
so that's almost two pounds hanging off
your CPU socket and then compatibility
is 1 40 millimeter by 1 40 millimeter by
25 millimeter so we flip and then lift
oh look at this you can actually see
through a window you can see the upper
Lima tech logo just like that ok but we
don't need that ok so we just slide
everything out all in sort of one go
here and then the first thing we find is
a user's manual so this shows all the
stuff that comes with the armageddon as
well as a little illustration ok and got
a little list here so you can go through
and make sure that everything is there
then we have the instructions on how to
install the armageddon so here it is
steps 1 2 426 sorry 123456 and some of
these are sort of multiple steps in one
but overall the process looks quite
simple
worried about not being able to do it or
anything like that so in here we have an
accessory pack which contains all of the
stuff on that list so we've got a pro
Lena tech thermal compound which looks
an awful lot like mx2 so it's probably
pretty good then we have the bracket so
these actually go where do these go this
is an interesting mounting system my mom
I'm not really sure I understand why
it's so beefy but it's kind of cool I
guess because you've got like these huge
huge aluminum chunks they feel like
they're made out of aluminum although I
could be wrong and then so those go on
your cpu socket just like that and then
you actually have a bolt through and
that hardware is probably in here it
goes all the way through your
motherboard and then secures somehow so
yeah here's some huge thumb screws and a
bunch of other stuff press here okay
cool here's a backplate this back plate
is compatible it looks like with 1156
1366 as well as 775 although they don't
advertise 775 to that ability on the box
so it's possible it doesn't include the
hold down here we go here's the
Armageddon so the first thing you notice
about it is that this is a natively
supporting 1 40 millimeter cooler so
most of the tower heat sinks I've seen
in the past are actually quite a bit
narrower and the reason for that is that
they only support 140 millimeters an
afterthought there are 120 millimeter
heatsink that kind of has clips on it
for 140 mil so this wideness is what's
going to give you the ability to take
all of these heat pipes and line them up
within each thin site within each side
of the fins so here we've got actually a
total of one two three four five six
standard sized heat pipes so these look
like six-millimeter heat pipes they
don't look like the larger eight
millimeter ones but we've got six of
them that are all coming out of the base
so the ones that go through the middle
of the base are actually going out to
the very outside of the heatsink and
there's a very specific reason for that
and that's because the outside of the
heat sink is where you're actually going
to get the most air flow because of the
shape of a fans blades so that's why all
the ones that are at the
outside are actually kind of in the
middle where they're not going to be at
nearly as useful let's see Steve there's
something else we can save us so we got
kind of a shiny top on the top and you
can sort of probably see my face if I
can look at the camera in that so it's
very very very shiny I'll do the
obligatory finger shot here where you
can see how reflective it is it's also
very flat so when you have this
installed in your case it's going to
look so you'll basically be able to look
at yourself through it we've got the
aluminum fins are quite dense actually
so you're going to want to pick a fan
that's got reasonably good static
pressure because some heat sinks will
actually have more spacing in between
the fins now that comes at a cost to
performance because it won't perform
quite as well but the advantage of
having the tight packed fins is that if
you do have a high-pressure fan you
can't get more performance out of it
whereas the low density fins if you have
a low performance fan then you can
actually get better performance out of
it than a densely tact thin arrangement
so I hope that wasn't too confusing the
camera says no I guess um and I think
that pretty much wraps up my unboxing of
the pro Lima tech arm again thank you
for checking it out and don't forget to
subscribe and that's pretty much it
thanks for watching my blog ok yeah I
forgot to show the shininess of the base
so there it is get the angle there you
can see the reflection of the finger
it's not that reflective but it is a
slightly bowed base so you're going to
get good contact pressure out of it and
that is by design that it's not
completely flat so you never want to lap
the heat sink with a bowed base I'm just
kind of guessing it has a blown base
based on looking at the reflection of a
straight line through it and seeing that
it has a bit of a curve to it you won't
be able to see that in the camera but um
I'm pretty sure they would all come with
one if this one does I hope it wasn't
intended to be flat because then I sort
of have ruined everything now have an
eye thank you for watching my blog and
now we're at
should we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
