have noticed that the other day we had
Ginsu knife set on sale and i had a
quite a few regret requests to do an
unboxing so i'm gonna take it one step
further and I'm actually here at UTSA
Japanese tapas in Vancouver where one of
our employees well his name's ruiji but
that's actually nothing to do with the
name of the restaurant but his brother
happens to work here and he arranged for
me to come in and not only do an
unboxing of the Ginsu knife set but also
give you guys a short demonstration
using the knives so there we go
all right so as promised this is the
unboxing video for the Ginsu essentials
set so this is a 5 piece make light prep
set you know I'm not actually quite sure
what the pronunciation is of this is as
you guys know this is Linus tech tips so
knives are not exactly my forte but here
we go we'll just have a look at the box
see what Ginsu has to say for themselves
here we've got serrated blades okay so
they're commercial quality serrated
blade that never need sharpening many
professional chefs recommend and utilize
this maintenance-free design okay and
then we also have
a census or tonight santoku day okay
the set includes a 5-inch two santoku
knife expertly designed for fine slicing
and effortless chopping so here's all of
the stuff that is included actually this
says five piece cutlery set includes so
you've got four knives as well as a
block to store them in you've got baked
laid handles natural wood knife block
and serrated blades they mention that
again and the Ginsu story several
decades ago a knife was created created
that to this day remains the sharpest
knife on the market it is the Ginsu
knife and if you want to hear just like
zoom in a little bit so that just move a
little closer you don't need to worry
about the zoom we have an apprentice
cameraman today who is one of the
employees here at yuji's tapas so there
you guys can read that if you want and
let's go ahead and get this opened up
I'm going to use my my trusty Spyderco
to open up in this other night
Eric we will find out exactly what's
going on inside this block so the first
thing we're gonna find is
environmentally-friendly corrugated
cardboard packing that's a lot better
than foam I do prefer to see that versus
a foam alternative we have okay caution
sharp objects open with care I didn't
imagine that when I was opening up I had
a knife set that I might find some sharp
object so it's very helpful them too to
mention that for me here is our wood
knife block which as long as I can find
an opening on one side or another
there we go I'll be able to show you
guys it's not you know single piece
construction or anything but it looks
reasonably alright there's a package of
do not eat so make sure you don't eat
that please and we've got so yeah you've
got yeah it's made out of like about six
different pieces of wood that are all
sort of pressed together and glued but
when it's actually sitting on your
counter it doesn't look too bad it's got
little plastic feet so I should get
scratch anything which is which is also
nice and let's open up the caution sharp
objects open with care package so make
sure you're not like you know running
around while you're trying to open this
up that could be dangerous there's a tip
for you all right here we go
Ginsu bakelite set limited lifetime
warranty so they are warranted to be
free from decent defects the knife will
be replaced for your charge by sending
three dollars per night to cover postage
and handling fees to that address cool
good stuff alright here are the four
knives which come in individual plastic
packages and then with paper sheets that
somewhat cover the blades and the thing
about a knife package is you probably
don't have to cut it open because
you can do that from the inside so there
is the 6-inch chef's knife with the
serrated edge on it it's made of
stainless okay
there is the handle like I said not a
knife expert I'm not going to be able to
tell you guys nearly a much about this
off the top of my head as I would would
say for example a motherboard or other
computer component and next we have the
5 inch santoku all right so that's knife
number 2 finally we have the 5 inch
utility knife which has the same the
same shape of serrated edge as the 6
inch chef's knife and here why don't I
put these in here as we go along so this
guy is going to go here this guy's gonna
go here and then last but not least we
have the three and a half inch paring
knife also a serrated edge so thank you
for checking out the unboxing there's
still more to come so this is George
this is a ruiji from our our ma
departments
brother and he works here at yuji's
tapas and he is going to be helping us
with our knife demonstration so the
first object that we are going to slice
up is please introduce that for us this
is a basically too much too comfortable
excellent
I hope you guys got a good look at that
it's a very complicated thing
so I George please tell us about them
which knife you would prefer to cut up
this in cucumber I would probably take
this a 5/8 santoku knife that's got this
straight edge it's part of what I'm more
most familiar with
okay this straight edge I never used to
have like this before but so there's
time everything will give it a shot
there's a funny thing we have a Japanese
chef who has never once used a serrated
blade so I'll get him to try both knives
and you can give us his impressions of
the straightedge versus the Ginsu
serrated it or so here let's have our
first cut all right that's pretty sharp
okay it's pretty sharp we've gotten that
far folks all right then
this part I do not recommend for
enormous or beginners okay guys so
please please do not try this at home I
know I say that a lot on my show but
usually I'm just joking please do not
try this at home so he is peeling the
cucumber by hand with a knife in fact he
seems to be going a little bit further
than peeling it I'm not familiar with
this process so we're just gonna have to
stay tuned and figure out what he's
doing but it seems that the Ginsu knife
is being operated with a far deal more
precision and skill then I could have it
done let's get to the core just checking
away we throw away the court okay it's
there in the garbage gone done we're
done with best
yeah
or just
so I guess the seeds are unsuitable for
yes for for Japanese purposes here well
in the sis's yes and this is the basic
julienne will put this inside sushi
rolls cool okay and I guess that would
have been quite a bit more difficult to
do with a serrated edge that wouldn't
have made a lot of sense well you could
give it a shot
okay let's give it a shot oh I meant the
peeling part but uh Oh slicing part is
right this is a nice fancy badge
all right we have more demonstrations
coming for you though guys we are now
going to do a piece of salmon so our
wonderful volunteer here is going to
suggest that which knife you would use
for the the piece of salmon that we have
just sitting right there ready money
travel can you do both it's a small
teaser okay we're gonna try both knives
again alright
there's the knife cutting through the
sanam eat okay so tell chef george's
recommendation from the Ginsu essentials
kit seems to be the 5 inch santoku knife
alright thanks guys for checking out
this very random episode of - tech tips
and don't forget to subscribe for more
videos about 12 really computers
motherboards overclocking reviews and
such but apparently we also do knives
thanks for watching
so it occurs to me now I did promise to
actually demo the knives myself although
my demonstration will be not nearly as
interesting as George's so there I cut a
piece of cucumber I also agree with him
that this knife is quite sharp now I'm
gonna try the other one
oh yeah that's definitely not as
suitable for cutting cutting vegetables
so uh yeah yeah I'm with I'm with him on
this one but I'm also going to show you
guys the other knives that we didn't
look at yet so this is the three and a
half inch paring knife okay alright see
can you got stabbing and slicing motion
going on here and then finally the 5
inch utility knife and now I'm down to
the parts of the cucumber that probably
aren't that delicious so let's find out
if cucumber tastes good when it's cut by
the Ginsu knife
it's a good cucumber
so thanks for checking out our little
video here at yuji's tappa so we are at
all you told me the address but ah yes
2:05 9 West 4th in Vancouver so guys
please feel free to come on down and say
hi to George just that just tell them
you're an MCI ex customer and you saw
the video and hopefully you'll be here
when you come by you can get some
Japanese food and it'll all be lots of
fun so thanks for checking out our video
