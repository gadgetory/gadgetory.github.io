the Silverstone Strider plus 1000 watt
this is an 80 plus silver power supply
with a hundred percent modular cables 85
to 88 percent efficiency class-leading
single 12-volt really ok alright well
yeah you know if you have a single 12
volt rail then you'll always be a
class-leading single 12 volt rail
because check that out it can deliver up
to 960 Watts on the 12 real look at that
they read it for peak power as well so
it's 1,100 Watts peak which means that
if you're monitoring the power of your
system and you see those little like
those little spikes it can handle that
no big deal okay that's good
Japanese mane capacitors silent running
135 millimeter fan PCIe 8 and 6 pin
connectors active PFC 24-hour continuous
power output with 42 C operating
temperature that's good you know a lot
of consumer grade components actually
are not rated for 24 hour a day
operation I don't know if you guys knew
that things like hard drives for example
even things like TVs did you know that
if the TV manufacturer finds out that
you're using your TV in a commercial
environment or in a 24/7 operation
environment your warranties bling I
think the exception is Toshiba I believe
so don't quote me on that one but
there's there's one guy there's one
company that allows their consumer grade
TVs to be used as digital signage and
then all the other ones void your
warranty immediately when they find out
that it's like just the address that
they go to service it at if they go to a
restaurant or something but then your
warranties void alright so here's this
check this out this is a thousand watt
power supply in basically just a
standard a standard length so that's one
hundred and thirty-five millimeter fan
and they haven't added any extra length
so you should be able to install this in
safe for example not that we have
anything crazy planned around this but
in say for example something like an SG
o 9 which is Silverstone's
sweet micro ATX case that I unboxed very
recently that we are planning well ok
I'll give it away we are planning to do
a building with this power supply so
there's your 1 through 8
okay so there's your 80 plus silver
badge as well as all your generals back
safety certifications all that good
stuff if it's made by silverstone it's
probably fine it's probably safe you can
use it in your country it's all good
there's that licensed patent thing for
the modular connectors that ultra
patented like a billion years ago
there's your back of the power supply oh
no power on and off that's interesting
which is just fine on the SGO nine since
the power supply ends up on the inside
of the case anyway one other cool thing
that we're going to be doing with the
sto nine is we're going to be showcasing
the short cable kit so you can see that
the strider 1000 plus comes with a
bajillion connectors which any thousand
watt power supply should because if
you're buying a thousand watt power
supply it should be because you have a
bajillion things to connect to it so
we've got 24 pin there you go twenty
plus four sleeving okay I wouldn't mind
say oh okay it does go up a little bit
further it looks like it just got loose
a little bit there you go slide that up
there then we've got to eight pin
connectors here we go
so we've got a four plus four and
another four plus four this is handy
because it gives you a lot of
flexibility a lot of them have a fused
eight pin and then a four plus four so I
don't mind this approach some server
motherboards have sort of weird ATX and
EPS connector configurations this I like
so this is something that I've seen from
silverstone before where they have two
six plus two s and then you can
disconnect these or not use them or
whatever else and then they have two
eight plus six or eight plus six so six
plus two and a six so if you have two
video cards that each take two
connectors then you can go ahead and you
can run one wire to each you can plug
these in if you have additional auxilary
plugs that you need to plug into then
you can use these individual ones some
motherboards now for example have
auxilary six pins so I mean something
like a kulit Boreas took an auxilary six
pin so so that's pretty neat so you can
connect up or you can just run the whole
thing up to your video cards and you
connect up to dual eight pin plus a 6
pin no big deal then we've got four
harnesses for our general auxilary
connect our general molex connectors and
SATA connectors so each of these
harnesses has three SATA connectors
wouldn't have minded seeing four but
they're quite long so you'll be able to
reach look at that it's like an entire
line of arm length and then all the way
down to a line
ribcage from there so quite long and
then next you've got two identical
harnesses that each have three four pin
molex a--'s and a floppy look at that if
you extend the floppy all the way you've
got like all the way down to a Linus
belt level from the Linus arm length
that it was previously at so fully
modular you can remove all of these
cables and replace them with short
cables if you have a case that is super
small and super coo which is exactly
what we're going to be doing part of the
reason that this is so flexible is
because of the size of the power supply
itself longer power supplies don't
always fit in small form-factor builds
so use as many cables or as few as you
want it's small I included accessories
so we have for cable management velcro
straps we have four black screws for
plugging in or for a screen into the
back of your case for thumb screws for
using those instead if you'd like so you
can use whichever screws you want for
look at that they like the number four
four zip ties for a cable management as
well in a nice thick power cable and
finally a manual and power power supply
all right they're so good at manuals
look at this they actually like put in
pictures they document everything their
cases particularly have excellent
manuals all kinds of really good little
tips and tricks and all that good stuff
