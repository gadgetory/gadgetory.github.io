of the gigabyte 890 FX a UD 5 and the
reason i'm actually unboxing this is i
unboxed the 890 FX aud seven very
recently and i was going to use it on my
test bench but i didn't realize even at
the time i was unboxing it that it's
actually one of those boards that's like
once lot longer than a normal ATX
motherboard so it didn't even fit on my
test bench so now I need a different
motherboard that supports USB to USB 3
e-sata and firewire so yeah they're
there there's one thing about this
motherboard it has support for seemingly
every conceivable external drive
interface possible so let's go over some
quick features here first of all it has
their 333 onboard acceleration that
means you got USB 3 USB power 3x and so
USB power 3 X is a way to deliver three
times the power through the USB 2 as
well as the USB 3 ports so it means you
can power more devices off one port very
cool Thank You gigabyte we've also got
say 23 which is four times the speed via
raid 0 oh ok that's an interesting way
to measure that because it's actually
two times the speed of c22 but I guess
if you r 80 did it would be four times
the speed ok and then we have a
three-year warranty in the US and Canada
as well as their new on/off charge so
you can see they've got like an iPhone
plugged into a USB port their USB ports
will actually charge certain devices
even when the computer is powered off
pretty sweet we've also got support for
ultra durable 3 which is a 2 ounce cost
of copper PCB Japanese solid caps all
that good stuff we have support for
amd's latest phantom 2 x6 6 core
processors as well as support for auto
unlocking so if you plug in a dual core
or a triple core then you will be able
to just automatically unlock the extra
cores as long as they are stable we have
support for 3-way crossfire X as well as
native support for say 236 gigabit per
second via the SB 850 so that means that
unlike the Intel boards out there in
these latest chipsets actually supports
a 23 natively you don't have to plug in
any additional third party chips
to the motherboard okay so let's have a
look at the accessories that are
included first we've got an i/o shield
and the cameraman is apparently trying
to move his wrist rest thing so that he
can get closer and look at my i/o shield
there we go then we have a user's manual
which has a driver DVD or utility DVD
rather download Billy to stop the
gigabyte website don't bother with that
in here we've got this is all English
and it covers bios settings installing
your drivers a couple basic
troubleshooting things front panel
headers we're to plug stuff into the
motherboard then you've got like a
physical installation guide book so how
to install a cpu this is more like a
quick start guide and it's in a bunch of
different languages including wow what
is this okay leave a comment if you know
what language this is are you not even
focused there you go wow I yeah never
heard of that okay next we've got four
SATA port or SATA ports for SATA cables
and these are two right angle and two
straight cables and then one ide cable
and then a random piece of paper it's
doing something in there for sure okay
here we go is that like a weird angle to
I haven't I've never seen a box like
this before all right oh we've got a
gigabyte powered sticker so this is
powered by gigabyte or rather your
computer will be when you put this
motherboard in it all right let's get
this board up in here stop rambling so
this board so far actually looks an
awful lot like the ud7 that i already
had a look at i see i can i can see
right away that there are quite a few
things in common so let's start at the
let's start at the center the board
we've got an am3 socket with support for
the latest phantom tues and including X
4 X 6 X 3 X 2 s whatever it is you want
to put in there it will be supported as
long as it is a m3 so that means that
you do have support for a dual-channel
ddr3 memory memory controllers in the
CPU so am-3 CPUs ddr3 board thumbs up
good stuff up at the top of the board
we've got our 8-pin cpu power connector
right where it belongs and that's under
sort of the the MOSFET cooling which I
guess we'll have a closer look at
later as I mentioned before ddr3
dual-channel these are color coded so
you want to put your dual channel
matching dims in the same color slots
then we have on-board power and reset
this is the perfect place for those in
my opinion because I think having them
down at the bottom of the board doesn't
make any sense because as soon as you
load it up with expansion cards you
can't access anything down here anyway
this is great you've got your 24 pin
power right where it belongs as well as
your floppy and ide connectors next
you've got a clear CMOS button and while
this isn't quite as good as at the back
I owe plate it is way better again than
having it down at the bottom of the
board where you can hardly even access
it when its installed in a case this is
terrific okay on the side we've got to
say to two ports those are running off a
third-party chipset which actually I
can't tell who makes it because it's
labeled gigabytes 802 okay and then we
have six say two three ports so those
are all running off of the ATI SB 850
southbridge then we've got system fan I
don't know what these are TSL one and
tsr 1 i'm guessing this is left and
right but um hmm left and right of what
impossible to say at this time okay
we've got another clear CMOS jumper here
that's kind of interesting so you can
clear the CMOS the old fashioned way as
well and then we've also got our front
panel headers including three USB one
firewire and 1.com then we have an lpt
wow really that's a parallel port header
I haven't seen that on a board in a
while okay mom good good on you gigabyte
for including that for the people who
still need it okay then we've got two
PCIe 1x slots for physical pcie 16x
slots and one pci slot now looking at
the electrical connections in these
slots these two are going to be 16 x 16
x if you're running sli or crossfire sli
if you're running crossfire this board
does not support sli only three way
crossfire and then these two ports are
going to run in eight X mode regardless
of what you're doing actually you know
what this one's for X only so if you're
running to crossfire cards you're going
to use this one and cover this slot and
then you're going to use this one and
cover
this slot for the maximum electrical
connectivity speed and then if you run
three cards you add another one here
covering the PCI slot and it would run
16 x 16 x 8x now since 8x actually
doesn't have an impact on performance
with modern video cards what I would
probably do is I try and find the long
crossfire bridge and I'd run it in this
one in this one that way you've got a
nice big gap between your cards you
leave open a 16 X maybe electrical 8x at
that point as well as a 4x lot and a 1x
lot and then you cover the ancient pci
slot that's probably what I would do so
here we've got our cooling solution so
here's the little cooler on the SB 850
southbridge you can see that it's not
going to do a whole lot cooling wise but
it looks cool and since it doesn't kick
off a whole lot of heat anyway it
doesn't really matter gigabyte has their
kind of Aztec inspired looking
northbridge cooler on here I really like
this once again that doesn't have like
very doesn't have a lot of fins on it is
not going to do a whole lot of cooling
but it totally doesn't matter because
the Northbridge again also doesn't kick
off a lot of heat then we've got our
MOSFET cooler this one does actually do
some cooling it's cooling the a plus 2
phase power design that is going to be
delivering power to up to six cores
worth of cpu processing power and this
board unlike the ud7 it's actually a
normal length so the ud7 doesn't have a
slot here it skips this slot and then it
has seven slots so the board is actually
a little bit longer go figure okay then
we're moving on to the back where we
will find ports so there are 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 USB 2.0 ports 1 ps2 keyboard mouse
combo port then you've got digital audio
out in both flavors optical as well as
coaxial then you've got two firewire
ports and these two are besides being
USB 2.0 ports they are also a SATA ports
so the USB 2.0 contacts are on the
bottom and the esata contacts are up
here on the top very cool then we have
USB 3.0 two gigabit ethernet as well as
7.1 audio out thank you for checking out
my unboxing at the 890 fxa you d 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
