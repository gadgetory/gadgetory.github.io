long without ever unboxing an antique
300 so here we are today it's not a new
product by any stretch of the
imagination but we have the antique 300
it is SSD hard drive compatible which it
wasn't when it was first released this
is a fairly old skew but still very
popular and ok so they're calling it a
versatile minis are you know like I even
featured it in a in an airflow
optimization guide a while back it just
must have maybe I shot an unboxing and
never actually uploaded it either way
picture of the case on the side filtered
front panel takes in air efficiently and
prevents dust buildup that's good okay
we've got our features and specs on the
side here and let's just go ahead and
start getting this open so the UNTAC 300
if you go to any kind of a land party
there's a couple cases that you're going
to see just a ton up you're going to see
a ton of 900s you're going to see a ton
of 300s this is a very very common
common case because it provides you
gamer type features such as optimized
airflow mesh fronts at a price point
that is very very attractive alright so
the first thing we find when we open up
the box is an tex characteristically
excellent packaging here you go so you
can see they're using a closed cell foam
that is going to protect your case from
any damage that could potentially occur
in transit so we've got a good inch plus
of foam on all sides of the chassis very
very nice to see that we've got some
documentation in here including a user's
manual and yep should give you some idea
how old the box design is despite its
eminently portable frame the 300 has
enough room for an Nvidia 8800 series
graphics card how impressive we're up to
the GTX 500 series at this point
for several generations away from with
an Nvidia 8800 series was a concern
whether it would fit in your case or not
it goes to show you that the development
cycles for cases are not quite as fast
as they are for graphics cards nor do
they need to be if you have a well
featured plastic looking suitcase then
you don't really need to redo it for
quite some time all right here it is the
300 so you find first of all the mesh
front you've got three five and a
quarter inch bays and then you have dual
120 millimeter intakes
in the front of the case so these are
filtered intakes although I'm not
actually sure how the filters come out
for this particular one it does not come
preloaded with fans there but at least
it does give you the option of adding
them so that you have airflow going
directly over your graphics cards or
graphics card I guess if you don't run
to which most people don't from the
front of the chassis nice thumb screws
those nice wide thumb screws so it's
easier to get a grip on them then the
then the smaller head thumb screws we're
going to take side panels off so the
side panels use a pretty standard finish
it's not quite that super matte finish
but it's also not glossy so it's going
to be fairly fingerprint resistant but
not perfect I mean if you keep your case
reasonably clean it's not really a
concern on the side you can see we've
got a punch out for a 120 millimeter fan
so that's going to blow directly over
your graphics card so it's all about
graphics card cooling the way I would
probably set this case up for optimal
cooling would be to 120 millimeters as
intakes in the front and then I would
set this one right here up as an exhaust
because most cards these days I mean it
depends what you're using but if you
have an Nvidia reference card for
example it's going to be drawing air in
on this side and kicking it out on this
side so you want to you want to help it
rather than work against it so let's
look at the inside of the case as you
can see it's a fairly basic chassis in
terms of its construction we've got one
two three four five six five three and a
half inch drive bays
we have our SSD
mount here at the bottom so you can see
they've retrofitted it with that so
you're just going to screw these in from
the bottom you can mount one SSD here
and it can still support its full
complement of three and a half inch
drives even if you do that there are the
mounts for your five and a quarter inch
so there's no tooless stuff going on in
this chassis it's very basic I mean to
lists if you're only going to build the
system once isn't that big of a deal
it's only if you're doing frequent
modding you're going to want to consider
maybe getting a higher end chassis such
as the 900 which uses thumb screws to
mount the drives for example all right
here we've got our motherboard tray
which features a nice big cutout so no
matter where your motherboard positions
the CPU socket you shouldn't have any
problems swapping out a CPU cooler even
if I you have a backplate on the back of
it so you can just take that off and you
don't have to take out the motherboard
or anything like that
here's power for our top 140 millimeter
fan we've got all of our front leads for
the front power switch front lights
actually what do we have on the front of
this case let's have a look so we have
two front USB two ports we have a
microphone port headphone port and a
power switch well okay there's a reset
switch in there so it's hard to hit by
accident that's a really thoughtful
feature actually all right mother word
mount you've got room for your standard
ATX motherboards you're not going to get
much longer you're not going to get much
wider it's got your standard seven PCI
slots bottom mounted power supply this
is one of the first value chassis that
did offer the feature of the bottom
mounted power supply remember ntek did
pioneer that with the p180 at least on
the mainstream I mean there's always on
water who's done it before someone else
but they were the first ones who brought
a mass production case to market with a
bottom mounted power supply okay we've
got a 120 millimeter fan in the back
that comes pre-populated with a 120
millimeter fan this is one of their tri
cool fans so you can set it to low
medium or high the one on
is actually not a try cool so that one
runs at full speed regardless so the
total fans that you can populate in this
case are 140 up in the top 120 in the
back and then two more 120 s in the
front as intakes alright
in terms of accessories there's not a
whole lot going on here this is our
entire accessory box
thumbscrews other screws that's it so if
you want you know fancy add-ons then
look elsewhere I suppose cable
management so we've got a little we've
got little zip ties back here for
managing cables on the side of the drive
cage so this will allow you to hide your
cables if you're using a non modular
power supply you can just bundle them
all up here time down and that would
probably be the best way to go about
that so I think that's pretty much all I
have to say about 300 I don't think I
ever showed a view from the back so
that's what it looks like if you haven't
seen one before don't forget to
