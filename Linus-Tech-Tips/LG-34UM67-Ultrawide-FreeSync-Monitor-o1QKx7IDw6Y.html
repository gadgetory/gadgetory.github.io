first one I've seen but it is the first
I've seen that targets gamers so
directly welcome to my video of the LG
34 um 67
fractal design listens and the define
are five case was made with feedback
from you the community so click my face
to learn more about that and give your
feedback so let's start by having a look
at her physically mmmm if you watched my
video on the 34 um 95 just under a year
ago you already know pretty much how
this story goes the stand is see-through
which is neat but it's otherwise subpar
since only its tilt and angle can be
adjusted without removing and replacing
the two screws that let you change the
height a grand total of like an inch and
there's some unfortunate stuff at the
back as well that glossy plastic is
going to do what glossy plastic does
best although we might have an idea for
a solution so make sure that you're
subscribed for that video and while the
standard vase amount and included
sticker to protect the back of your
monitor are welcome sites folks who want
to wall mount this puppy will need to
buy low profile angled connectors for
anything but the second HDMI input so
the audio passed through HDMI one DVI or
DisplayPort ports no USB hub back here
something I would have liked to see on
such an expensive display as well moving
around to the front things get quite a
bit better in a hurry
the bezel around the mat anti-glare
coated 2560 by 1080 75 Hertz IPS panel
is super slim and LG's joystick for
navigating the on-screen menu is present
and what an on-screen menu it is it
lacks an sRGB color profile even though
99% srgb coverage is a selling point on
the monitors web page for some reason
but if you've got a calibration tool the
sixaxis color adjustments will let you
take care of that easily and just about
anything else you can set it to six bit
or 8-bit color adjust pixel response
times although as usual I found medium
was the best compromise and much better
than older IPS panels by the way you can
tinker with their black stabilizer
feature which is similar to Ben Hughes
black equalizer in contrast reducing
effect that makes it easier to see
objects in shadows and games without
washing out all of the colors on screen
you can use any of the pre-configured
gaming
modes that monkey around with color
gamma and sharpness or you can make your
own that you can switch to by pressing
up on the joystick twice and then you
can enable and disable a couple of LG's
other killer features for the 34 um 67
as well the first is Daz or dynamic
action sync this one is pretty simple
it's designed to reduce display lag or
the time between the monitor receiving a
frame and displaying it on the screen
usually this feature is labeled on TVs
as a game mode or similar and results in
dramatically worse image quality thanks
to less pixel processing but in the case
of the 34 um 67 I can't find any reason
with my bare eyes to turn it off it
looked exactly the same to me and the
second killer app compliance with the
optional adaptive sync portion of the
DisplayPort 1.2 a standard and AMD
freesync certification this monitor
supports dynamic refresh rate gaming
where you're supported system can
effectively tell the monitor when to
refresh the image eliminating the issues
associated with vsync on so that is
stuttering in leg and vsync off that
tearing effect where there seems to be a
horizontal line through the image where
there's half of one frame and half of
the next one on the screen at the same
time there are some caveats here though
in addition to a compliant display
you'll need a support at AMD dedicated
or onboard graphics solution you'll need
a display port cable curiously not
included in the box and you'll need a
free sync compatible driver so I used
two beta one provided by AMD for my
evaluation of this monitor yes friends
Nvidia graphics card owners will not be
able to take advantage of the dynamic
refresh rate of this monitor unless
Nvidia decides to go down the DP one
point to a open standard route sometime
in the future instead of asking monitor
vendors to buy their own g-sync scaler
chip something that at this time is
quite expensive and only supports
DisplayPort input but Nvidia claims will
have other advantages down the line we
can talk about that when that comes but
first let's talk about the usage
experience of this monitor I still love
ultra wide for productivity but I'm also
still not super stoked on 2560 by 1080
that particular use case I found myself
frustrated with the number of vertical
pixels scrolling a lot the same way that
I always was way back in the day of the
dinosaurs when sixteen by ten monitors
went out of fashion to be replaced by
sixteen by nine 1080p monitors and this
issue if for me is made worse by the
size of this display thanks to its IPS
panel contrast color vibrancy and
viewing angles are not issues but with
pixel density this low even with no
scaling text looks abominable and no
amount of low blue light reading modes
made it feel comfortable for me to use
compared to its 34 40 by 1440 brethren
also from LG but I understand why LG did
it this way they didn't really have a
choice
from the marketing this is a gaming
monitor first and productivity monitor
second and 34 40 by 1440 is just about
80 percent more pixels than 2560 by 1080
which might make graphics card companies
happy with all the video cards they'll
be selling just so folks can play games
at native res but might not thrilled
gamers too much and in games the pixel
density bothers me a lot less I don't
find anti-aliasing unnecessary like I
did with Dells 5k monitor but four times
AAA was a good balance between
playability of very demanding games like
Crysis 3 at very high settings on an r9
290x and image quality gaming on the
screen this size is going to be
immersive pretty much no matter how you
slice it and thanks to its very low leg
solid motion blur performance and 75
Hertz panel that really does make a big
difference over 60 by the way the 34 um
67 is a pleasure to game on but hold on
a second - you didn't even mention
freesync yet you're right I didn't but I
will now here in the conclusion in spite
of this monitors presence named ease
free sync media materials and the
prominent logo on the box I didn't find
the implementation of free sync to be as
useful as it can be in this case but it
took me a few hours and a lifeline call
to my buddy Ryan shroud from PC
perspective to
figure out why I was encountering
stuttering and tearing with freesync
enabled when it was clearly working in
amd's windmill demo it's because this
monitors adaptive refresh rate window is
from 48 Hertz to 75 Hertz only 27 Hertz
that means even if you enable free sync
with vsync also on the experience is
pretty good as long as your frame rates
remain pretty high other than the very
slight input lag penalty similar to
vsync that is caused by capping your
framerate like that and with it off so
the vsync off you'll actually still get
tearing anytime your game runs above 75
fps and there's more bad news - you'll
get leg under 48 FPS thanks to LG's
selection of 48 Hertz as the low-end
cut-off of the adaptive refresh rate
window on this monitor but to be clear
this is not a knock on free sync there
are monitors with much wider like a
hundred Hertz Plus windows that go down
to 40 Hertz on the spec actually allows
for Windows as low as nine Hertz once
panel technology improves and it's
actually not a condemnation of the 34 um
67 as a gaming monitor either
its size IPS panel and ultra wide aspect
ratio along with its incredible
responsiveness for considering all of
those things still make it a totally
unique gaming experience it just means
that those two technologies didn't
complement each other as well as I was
really hoping for in this case so this
is cool we're giving away 31 month
xsplit professional codes all you got to
do is enter in the forum thread in the
video description and winners will be
selected one week from today April the
second pretty cool stuff not today April
the second on April the second yay
anyway if you don't know what xsplit is
it's basically a broadcasting software
that personally I absolutely love we use
it every Friday for our live show it
allows us to change scenes it allows us
to take a wide variety of different
inputs and basically switch them around
move people around we can import Skype
callers so that we can have people you
know
joining us for our podcast or video
podcast as it were and it's awesome for
Game streamers especially when it's
paired with xsplit gamecaster so there's
broadcaster and game caster so game
caster is great for gamers because it
allows you to bring up a little overlays
you can easily stop and start your
stream and all that kind of good stuff
one of the coolest things about xsplit
is that it is absolutely free for the
basic versions all you got to do is head
over to xsplit comm / Linus to start
streaming and recording in HD today so
