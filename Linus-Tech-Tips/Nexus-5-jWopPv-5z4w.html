Nexus 5 it's my actual first pure
Android experience and after three weeks
I guess it's pretty nice but I don't
really see what all the fuss is about
per se
I don't mind sense and TouchWiz with the
battery issues aside really isn't that
bad especially for non power users so
I'm going to kick this off in my usual
way with the stuff that other people
already told you so first of all there's
no SD expansion the phones available in
16 or 32 gig configurations and that's
it but other than that the hardware is
absolutely exceptional for 350 dollars
it's got a 2.3 gigahertz quad-core
Snapdragon 800 processor and very
capable Adreno 330 GPU the 5-inch 1080p
screen is beautiful with good but not
amazing viewing angles and it has all
the best wireless functionality
including AC Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 and qi
wireless charging which works well with
the official pad yeh
and even works well with a cheap one
that Brandon got on eBay so that's great
the physical overview the device is
pretty simple it's extremely light for
its size which I quite liked once I got
used to it but I did find it a shade too
big for me the Moto X is about perfect
for my small hands but people with
medium-sized hands will be very
comfortable with this my device is a
white one which with its glossy edge
that I found slippery and smoother non
soft touch rear finish is in my mind
inferior to the black one just don't
tell that to the extremists the top has
a three-and-a-half millimeter jack
tastefull joke done now the bottom has a
speaker grille for the one speaker and a
dummy one that actually has a microphone
behind it and the side has a volume
rocker and a stealthy Cemetery lock
button on the left and right sides
respectively
I like this positioning but I'd like it
more if the buttons were a little harder
to press accidentally the volume buttons
are easy to mash during video playback
and I would often find myself
accidentally adjusting volume when going
for the lock button and vice-versa on
the back we find the much-maligned
camera as well as a flash and both LG
and Nexus branding and on the front we
find the screen it's very very good
maybe subjectively not quite my favorite
but it's extremely good it's 1080p which
is a stunning 445 pixels per inch at
this screen
eyes and the viewing angles are solid
with vibrant but not over saturated
colors white whites and black blacks
there was one thing that ARCT me a
little bit and whether its motion blur
sort of a smoothing effect kind of thing
or just a phenomenally slow panel I did
find that when objects were moving
across it there was a bit of a
distracting motion blur however if I had
to choose between good viewing angles in
good color or good speed I will take the
former every time so it's one of my
favorite screens so far I had no issues
with touch screen accuracy and the touch
screen interface was not very visible
even on extremely uniform backgrounds a
haptic feedback feels a little bit loose
and is definitely below average tough to
come from the Xperia z1 but your mileage
may vary with that one and the last
thing about the screen is I think the
auto brightness was a bit of a missed
opportunity it just doesn't go down low
enough in complete darkness I can
manually override it but it seems like
this should be a relatively simple fix
in software boot up time on the device
is slow but if that's to make it faster
during actual use then I'm all for it
I rarely reboot my phone anyway normally
although my experience may be a bit
unusual but I've actually had the Nexus
5 crash about half a dozen times on me
in the last three weeks so KitKat
definitely feels a bit rough around the
edges for me but I'm sure that will
change in time but I'll take that
trade-off for slower boot time for
faster performance for sure
now there's lots of discussion online
about the camera from my use it's okay I
guess it's definitely better with the
4.4.2 update but there's still no 4k or
slo-mo or anything the reality of it is
I'm not a powerful for though so since
no one complained my cheesy Instagram
pictures were worse than usual I'm good
the UI of the app really does need some
work though I appreciate simple design
and swiping to the right to access the
gallery instead of having a dedicated
button is natural and looks very clean
but I found it cumbersome to have to
switch modes to record video or take
pictures rather than just having to
dedicated buttons optical image
stabilization worked very well and was
very noticeable and the autofocus is
vastly improved in the 4.4.2 update but
I still wish that clicking anywhere on
the screen while taking video would
manually focus on that particular object
rather than just snapping a picture of
it once more UI complained about the
camera if your
buttons is not always better so let's
talk about battery life now as far as
that's concerned I think some people
were expecting more than a 350 dollar
device can deliver the Nexus 5 has a
pretty mediocre 2300 milliamp hour
battery but it's also got some clever
background power saving and resource
management features enabled by Android
4.4 that really help it deliver solid
performance in everyday scenarios I
thought the reality of it is if you
hammer the phone with heavy use like
gaming then its battery will drain like
any other phone with the same hardware
and the one with the most milliamp hours
wins in my real-world use I sometimes
had 30 to 40% at the end of the day and
as a somewhat heavy non-gaming user I'm
quite happy with that
enabling art or Android runtime which
increases the storage space taken by
your apps but makes them faster to
launch and easier to run has also been
reported to improve battery life
significantly the only caveat here is
that it also reduces app compatibility
including breaking whatsapp with that
said Etzel one of my staff was able to
find a recompiling workaround that got
what stopped working and loves art but
your mileage may vary the phone never
got uncomfortably warm for me except on
my initial boot when it installed a
bajillion apps so that was that was
great
speaking of all the apps though iOS has
had this functionality for years so I
don't understand why I can't fully
uninstall apps directly from the home
screens if you're going to have a
terrible app tray with no support for
folders search or other sorting methods
please don't make me navigate through it
to manage my apps I have a lot of apps
on my phone
Sony's and HTC's app trays are much
better I guess you just really want
people to stop using the app tray and
start using home screens the way that
you intended for them - Touche Google
and no support for basic toggles like
portable hotspot flashlight or
auto-rotate what the Google this is
supposed to be the future even iOS has
swiping up to turn the flashlight on I
okay well fine thank goodness it's
Android so it's at least flexible I can
install power toggles on iOS 7 no matter
what I do I still can't change the
layout of my quick toggles or even lock
the device in landscape mode on iPhones
or iPods so I guess at least Google's
flavor of intentionally bad design is
Sapir
you're here speaking of bad design
another thing I didn't like multitasking
is such a simple thing to do right and
yet no one does it yes three and
two-thirds is technically multi but nine
is definitely better this scrolling
through everything nonsense didn't work
well for Windows Vista and it's really
not any better here I like both OS 10s
expose and ironically Chrome for Android
implementations and multitasking better
one positive here though is that at
least switching between running apps
even games and videos is really snappy
like super awesome let's move on to
hangouts as your SMS application which
wasn't super awesome I don't like it
Windows Phone 8 did the whole
integrating all your accounts thing much
better with the People Hub it integrated
more services such as LinkedIn and
pulled all the messages together for
easy reference Google for some
phenomenally like I can't figure out why
they did this some reason ties all your
SMS messages into one of your Google
accounts and you need to manually switch
between them to see message histories
across services with the same people one
person can have multiple Google accounts
Google please stop treating Google
accounts like everyone has just one and
we should all use our real names and we
should all be on Google+ and the day
Google lets us have a master Google
account that can admit extremely happy
day for me on top of the inconvenience
of not being able to search for things
it's just not economic the switchers in
the top left corner I don't care how big
your hands are that's really hard to
reach if you're operating the device
one-handed another small complaint is
that clicking the new message icon in
the top right doesn't fire up the
keyboard right away to search for my
contacts Google I click this because I
wanted to message someone who I didn't
just message who was in the most
frequently accessed context of the
recent contacts on the very last page
the whole thing just feels very first
attempt II which I guess is natural
enough since it is there's even stupid
stuff like not being able to copy part
of a message like an address to paste
into Google Maps with all of that aside
it's just software I'm sure they're
going to get it sorted out but for now
I'd rather use anything else and once
again thank goodness of on Android
because I can my last major complaint
about the phone is that whether it's a
software or hardware
the GPS takes longer than my old iphone
4 to lock in my position and if i´d be
eight from the path set out for me
compared to my HTC One it'll take over
ten seconds longer to figure that out
and calculate a new path for me so that
was a little bit frustrating let's move
back to the things I like the
multicolored notification LED with light
flow being able to color change and you
know change the pattern for different
stuff is great and swiping down from the
top for notifications now works without
pausing media playback which is
absolutely incredible it's so convenient
to change brightness or see incoming
messages while keeping my YouTube video
running in the background love it
swiping up from the bottom for Google
now working all over the phone is great
as well I mostly use Google now to set
my alarm for the next day and navigate
with GPS but when Google now supports
more voice commands I will definitely be
ready to do lots more other stuff as a
SwiftKey lover the stock android
keyboard did bother me a little bit at
first but it learned really fast and i
love how natural it feels to click on my
misspelled words and how many options it
gives me to correct them that's really
cool it took about a week and a half but
now I really like it I'm still going
back to Swift key but it's definitely my
second favorite the thing I find it
lacks compared to Swift key is the
prediction of your next word doesn't
seem to learn from your frequent phrases
in the same way every time I've typed
Nexus on this device since I got it I've
followed with a five but it still
suggests one to me the phone part of
this phone also needs some love now
because it's really really good I love
the sticky preferred primary contacts
numbers and the option to be able to
change it and lock it in rather than
just having it guess all the time I love
dialing by name that prevents me from
having to dig through my contact list
and most importantly Google caller ID is
awesome like awesome it picks up on
numbers from VoIP lines that my normal
caller ID just calls unknown numbers
allowing me to avoid spam calls and
calls from my in-laws who have boy much
more easily
it also populates pictures and info for
people in businesses so privacy concerns
aside I absolutely love it and I think
it's great call quality is also great
aside from the audibility of the
speakerphone for me but the speaker is
just quiet in general for calls and for
media playback so if I had to complain
about something here I guess it would be
that face rejection might need a little
bit of tweaking I hung up on people a
few times but I'm sure that
quick fix all that's left now our final
thoughts if you want the latest vanilla
Android experience with stunning
performance housed in a device that
delivers amazing specs for the price
then go buy one it's good build quality
to the constant updates are great I mean
in fact it's gotten a four point four
point one and 4.4.2 update already and
this is the perfect product for
tinkerers and enthusiasts with that in
mind I still think I'd recommend
something with like TouchWiz to a less
tech-savvy friend or family member
because with bleeding edge software
comes bleeding edge workarounds and
tweaks and all that kind of stuff
speaking of tech-savvy workarounds
