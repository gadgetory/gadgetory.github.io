brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and SteelSeries hey guys we're here at
Nintendo checking out the Nintendo 2ds
now the big story around this is no
hinges but you've had some pretty good
retorts to that and what do you have to
say about it
so Nintendo 2ds first off is the newest
member of the Nintendo 3ds family of
course just announced a few days ago
playable for the first time here at PAX
2013 really excited about that
as the newest member of the Nintendo 3ds
family it it plays all 3ds games and
Nintendo DS games in 2d as the name
implies so we're really targeting that
audience maybe players that want to play
games like Animal Crossing new leaf
Pokemon X Pokemon Y but don't have a
Nintendo 3ds yet this is a chi pop the
the lowest priced option at one 29.99
also it's just too deep me personally i
will never play a game in 3d because it
really really hurts my eyes
so I have no real draw for the 3d so
when I heard there was another one
coming out in 2d that had already
intrigued me so yeah that's actually a
great point some folks maybe they can't
see 3d or maybe they just don't like
using the 3d option so from a functional
standpoint this is essentially playing a
Nintendo 3ds with the 3d depth slider
turned all the way off right so the
games still look gorgeous and you don't
need the 3d to actually play the games
you know certain games do look great I
personally love Legend of Zelda a link
between worlds upcoming it's got some
great 3d effects but at the same time
looks great in 2d so absolutely cool
know one thing I heard you say earlier
about the no hinges thing actually was
that you've had a lot of save mother's
coming up saying that they were very
happy that there was no hinges because
it feels a lot sturdier I came in kind
of kind of worried because I liked the
hinges idea but after feeling it I still
kind of want hinges but I definitely
understand why someone would just want a
slate idea with no hinges because it
does feel really solid Nintendo's known
for you being able to drop their device
and it's still working not that I
recommend it but a lot of their products
are quite sturdy so I'm not surprised to
see that out of this one and there's a
few other form factor changes like the
the top buttons can you tell me more
about those so
right as you mentioned the the buttons
you've got everything you have on the
Nintendo 3ds Nintendo 3ds XL so your
plus control pad circle pad your face
buttons the top l and r buttons where
your left and right index fingers go
they have more of like a curved design
now so you can actually you know press
it from the even from the sides from the
top just feels really comfy when you get
your hands on there how did you feel
when you kind of went hands-on earlier
that was great I didn't really like the
idea of hooking my entire finger on the
top I do have large hands but I didn't
feel the need and I claw grip mice I
don't know how much how into computer
gaming you are but I claw grip mice so
I'm usually like this anyway so I was
claw gripping the top buttons which was
interesting that I could do that and it
works totally fine because there seems
to be actuation points around it which
is interesting is there what's your
favorite thing about this device for me
I really like the way it just feels when
you when you pick it up and you actually
get in your hands it just feels really
natural and comfortable you know the the
buttons actually are located a little
bit higher up now near that top screen
but it feels great I think my favorite
feature though is still that it has all
of the great things that then in tendo a
3ds Nintendo 3ds XL does - the 3d so it
still comes with a four gig SD card
still have the wireless so those great
you know a shop games you can download
like Harmon ight attack of the friday
monsters you've got all that abilities
just at a lower price point and that
cost is I think probably my favorite
feature because come gift season I know
I'm gonna be buying some of the it hits
a price point that is actually pretty
good for a lot of people's gift seasons
where a lot of the other ones didn't now
release date for this device is actually
timed with something else
what is it timed with so Nintendo 2ds
launches October 12th it's gonna be
coming out the same day as Pokemon X
Pokemon Y so great timing there if
you're in the market we actually had you
know a lot of folks yesterday some
college students actually coming in
saying you know what I have to find a
way to play Pokemon X I'm a college
student I don't have a lot of money so
this is going to be how I'm going to be
playing it was a common common theme
among some of the college students in
here yesterday but not that it was a
good thing but a bunch of friends of
mine in university we actually rush out
and bought black and white and played it
in lectures so I'm not surprised that
the college kids were happy to see
Pokemon
another thing that I want to add that my
cameraman Brandon noticed when he had
hands on the with the device is that he
liked that the buttons were up by the
screen he found a lot easier if he got
out of orientation to find the buttons
again so that's another little adder for
you guys out there so if you weren't
super stoked the Nintendo 2ds there are
things to look at it is very solid the
buttons are higher new shoulder buttons
are great all that kind of stuff thank
