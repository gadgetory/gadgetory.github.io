31a this is an 8.9 inch android 4.2 ice
cream sandwich tablet okay it uses a 4
by 3 aspect ratio so it's 1024 x 768 in
terms of the screen resolution let's
have a look at what's included hi okay
it's not a fairly complete overall
accessory package this is handy so a
mini USB 2 full-size USB adapter allows
you to easily plug a USB device even hey
if you even wanted to use like a 3g
modem USB adapter you can even plug that
in so while the unit is not 3g capable
out of the box you can use that as a
solution as well this is just for data
transfer and syncing and whatnot you've
got a power cable for charging takes
about five hours to charge the device
from a standstill according to the
manufacturer spec we have another USB
cable so this one's USB a to mini being
so for whatever that's for okay lots of
USB cables we've got for whatever reason
what appeared to be Apple oam headphones
really they must be clones yeah they
must be close okay well white headphones
that are included okay we've got a
little guide to android 4.2 let's have a
look at the tablets also you can see the
screen has what is called a bubble
screen so this is a capacitive 5-point
multi-touch screen and the technology
behind it is because the but no I'm just
kidding it does have a 5-point
capacitive multi-touch screen but it is
not a bubble screen that is just a
screen protector that came in the box so
you can see the aesthetic is an awful
lot like the iPad it does have a front
mounted camera as well as a rear mounted
camera so you can use it for chat
applications that card that I drove over
there covered up my notes but let's go
ahead and take the back off of here
that's quite nice actually has a metal
back so kind of anodized metal finish on
the back that seems like it should be
reasonably durable how much flex to the
unit
great okay volume controls are here
these look familiar and then that's you
know what give me a sec here guys so I
don't remember where we left off anymore
it's actually been a while I connected
to Wi-Fi installed angry birds because
everyone loves angry birds look at those
birds are so angry actually that's the
only one that's angry he's more confused
and so is he he's sad he's really
confused and hopefully it'll go ahead
and sorta let me play the game overall
the tablet is very smooth it's actually
using an a8 processor so it's while it's
not necessarily the yeah we get it well
it's not necessarily the newest possible
thing it does run pretty pretty cleanly
pretty smoothly you can see scrolling
around here scrolling around inside the
Ice Cream Sandwich various home screens
internet is not tested yet but hopefully
it's pretty good because we're about to
try it no idea it's the poem okay give
it a sec alright so let's open a new tab
let's go ahead and go somewhere so let's
go to NCI x.com because there's a bunch
of flash and stuff going on again one of
the advantages of android tablets versus
an iOS device is the ability to run
flash so you can see all of the helpful
advertisements on NCIX com such as this
one actually it's possible we don't have
flash installed on it yet so one author
it is okay so web browsing could be
smoother although that's a complaint
about Android in general so probably
helps if I oh wait wait give it a sec
there we go okay so not too bad let's go
to the forum Wow accuracy is really good
i was able to click on that tiny little
forum button without any difficulty
whatsoever huh look at that so web
browsing could be faster but don't hold
that against the tablet because part of
the problem is almost double is
definitely the fact that we have so many
interfering Wi-Fi connections around
here there's got to be about 25 wireless
networks within range of the tech tips
room which is one of the reasons is so
difficult for us to demo anything
wireless in here so they
sickly there's your butt as you're
zooming looks a little something like
that there's you're scrolling whenever
it's not waiting for the page to load so
actually not not bad at all especially
given the price point so let's just see
if there's anything else right right we
haven't even looked at the unit physical
yet so this is a 16 gig model there's a
sticker somewhere that says 16 gigabytes
it's a 2 megapixel camera on the back oh
right whatever these buttons did so
these buttons evidently are not volume
control I assume they were but that's
apps and option and then this is the
back button so you actually have a
physical back button which is kind of
cool oh that's camera apparently let's
look at another tablet through tablets
like the tub deception so there's your
dedicated back button on the side we
find a bunch of stuff so there is your
grill for your speakers there's your
headphone jack there's your mini USB
there's your microSD so you can put up
to a 32 gig micro SD in here for
expanded storage there is you're right
that's where you can plug in the 3g
dongle using that included cable then
there is your AA mini HDMI excellent
power and finally well power in and then
the power button so battery life is in
the neighborhood of depending on who you
ask anywhere from five to ten hours and
it can go up to 20 days in standby which
is nice I have an Android tablet that
doesn't last that long instead what I
it's kind of a pain in the but not this
one it's a different one um 1024 x 768
screen I think we covered that supports
HD playback doesn't have bluetooth
unfortunately but obviously it does have
Wi-Fi from that camera can connect is
yep yep yep can expand mini HDMI and I
think that pretty much covers it so
basically in a nutshell nice overall my
nice overall build with the metal back
that is very fingerprint resistant like
no matter what i try to do it's not
getting all grubbed up which is a
complaint that i had even about the ipad
and you know spite of its otherwise
awesomeness because Apple made it and it
is therefore amazing screen actually
feels pretty good the screen is actually
pretty impressive I hate personally
seeing the touchscreen interface of a
tablet I find that very very
bothersome and you really can't see it
it's a very flat screen no ripple to it
and you can just barely make out some
vertical lines I thought you couldn't
see it at all actually until I just saw
those now so it doesn't bother me at all
even compared to something like
transformer gen 1 where it's got those
dots all over the screen that just drove
me crazy yes crazy enough to like say it
like that like crazy so we're going to
install fruit ninja free just to check
out the stuff in download check out the
5-point multi-touch guess we can also
see the download speed here just pretty
good considering we're in the tech tips
room I just reset the router so maybe
that's a that's helping a little bit
maybe it jumped the gun there hard to
say so you guys yeah I mean this is some
this is some usability time with the
tablet there's your responsiveness I'm
actually I'm overall I'm pretty
impressed especially given the price
point it's not bad at all we can link go
on the youtubes and can see if we can
find a video of like some guy talking
about tablets or something if you guys
want to see a video of like a whoops
okay there we go if you guys want to see
a video of a really unresponsive tablet
I'll show you a really good one it's
like walls
yeah that one this one it was like eight
minutes in between trying to do things
and then actually happening linus tech
tips video how do i adjust the volume if
those aren't volume buttons there must
be some way I don't know slicks pointing
at something bad only what to do mMmmm
sound this probably isn't the fastest
way to do it but it's done now never
again okay back I'm not actually an
Android expert by any stretch of the
imagination so not bad it actually looks
really good do you think I just looks
naughty viewing angles not bad either
actually go out yeah it's it's very
usable from about here to about here
here why you look at it wow that's
awesome okay so moving along for ninja
free we get to see my fruit ninja skills
and I think we're pretty much done how
long is this video it's a long video
sorry guys tablets are one of those
things where if we don't do a little bit
of usability though than the videos sort
of a waste anyway nobody cares about
open fade and my stats on fruit ninja
free come on you can do it lose them to
fill screen stretch to fill screen zoom
stretch to stretch zoom stretch zoom
stretch
okay give me a sec guys all right so
here's our fruit ninja demo it did
finally manage to load and then for sure
it'll be a bomb next I played this game
before so there's our five since the
hacks our way to play ah whoa so beat
huh audit okay well its got a gig around
which I didn't mention before and I
think that pretty much covers it thank
you for checking out my unboxing your
first look at this pretty value-oriented
that's a pretty good value little tablet
