fully private click now to learn more so
our main video editor is actually
getting a new editing machine so where
it's more of a Frankenstein together of
some existing things and you know get
some new things and we're kind of we're
going to end up with what's a very
strange rig so for people who are
sitting there thinking oh well this will
be the optimal video editing works
didn't no no no this is not necessarily
what we're going for here his machine is
built for a very specific usage model
which is what he exactly does and that's
that's pretty much it so I'm going to
run through a quick parts list here
starting off with an Intel Core i7 39 60
X this is where the whole this isn't
necessarily stuff I would recommend
thing comes into play because normally
for a video editing workstation I'd
probably recommend a 3930k as opposed to
a 39 60 X because extreme additions
don't really offer a great price to
performance ratio we're going to have 32
gigs of kingston valueram ddr3 1600
absolutely nothing special just because
it happens to be validated for the board
that's some more important to us than
necessarily squeezing an extra to 3% of
performance out of whatever it is we're
doing I'm going to be using an Asus
Rampage 4 gene motherboard ok it's not a
workstation board however it should be
noted that even a Seuss's gaming or
channel boards go through very a
significant amount of validation in
terms of sort of weird obscure card
operation and stuff like that and he'll
be running a 10 gigabit nic also it
should be noted that ROG boards have
very high-end PRM solutions we're going
to be building this inside a small
enclosure that's not going to have a
whole lot of space so we're going to
need something that runs as coolly and
as efficiently as possible and in
addition to that basically it's just as
sweet as it gets in terms of micro ATX
LGA 2011 motherboards because we want
more cores
we're running six cores in this machine
6 cores 12 threads because we need
wicked CPU performance with that said we
also need wicked GPU performance we need
lots of PCI Express slots so we're
have two graphics cards in this system
one of them is going to be I'm just
going to reach over here one of them is
going to be a quadrille 4000 and we used
to use this for all the CUDA
acceleration as well as getting 10 bit
color depth capabilities however we are
going to be changing that up a little
bit because this is based on a GTX 470
it's based on an ancient GPU at this
point so it's kind of got a go which
means that we still want it for the
better color depth output but we need
something a little bit beefier when it
comes to CUDA acceleration and that's
why we're adding a secondary graphics
card to the system so we're going to be
throwing in the geforce gtx 780 win
force from gigabyte this should be able
to stay cool data quitly because of its
massive cooler even though it's in a
very small m ATX case and should give us
lots of CUDA acceleration performance
for applications like DaVinci Resolve or
outputting using the built-in h.264
encoding feature in Kepler diesel found
a what was it it's a plugin yeah a
plug-in that is allows it to use that to
be much much faster than relying just on
the CPU but of course we still need a
beefy CPU because there are lots of
things we're going to be doing that will
be CPU bound as well for the power
supply
I don't know how borderline this is
going to be but I've got a dark Power
Pro 550 watt we're going to find out if
that ends up sort of reaching the max or
not once we finish the build so if it
does then I'll swap it out for something
else but I went with a dark power power
supply because they're very very quiet
and one of the things that happens a lot
of the time with particularly diesels
rig because he's got it running balls to
the walls and maxed out all the time is
that it runs really really loud so I'm
hoping this will help a little bit
although the CPU cooler is going to be a
big part of that equation as well now I
needed something low profile and this is
again part of the get onus of this rig
in spite of how awesome it's going to be
is that this was the only low-profile
CPU cooler I had lying around so this is
a fan text pH TC 90 LS which is
extremely low profile like honestly this
could probably
like a 1 you almost now probably like a
to you but it's got this little tiny fan
it claims to be LGA 2011 compatible and
capable of dissipating a massive amount
of heat that these chips output however
I don't think we'll be doing any
overclocking with a heatsink this size
so there you go I guess we'll we'll find
out what happens we might end up
swapping this out as well but if their
marketing claims are accurate then we
may end up using it anyway I think
that's most of the components oh yeah
we're using a crucial M for SSD just
because they're reliable we trust them
it's not the best performing SSD on the
market by any stretch but we're not
really doing anything performance
sensitive with it we've got a
Velociraptor 1 terabyte that's going to
go in there that just acts as a random
scratch disk or sort of temporary
storage but mostly we're going to be
storing things off of the machine itself
on our 10 gigabit capable Nazz
server so that's why we need that 10
gigabit NIC card so that means we've got
a single slot quadrille a 10 gigabit
single slot NIC as well as a dual slot
GTX 780 all in this machine now i ended
up with a silverstone SGO one I was
actually going to use what is that thing
I was going to use an SG o9 but what I
realized is that it doesn't have a five
and a quarter inch bay and I wanted a
built-in card reader because as you can
imagine doing video production reading
off of memory cards comes up a fair bit
it also has built-in fan control and
he's one of the few people I've ever met
who actually tunes his fans according to
what he's doing so I'll set that up for
him as well and I think that pretty much
wraps it up so here we go so the first
step for me is usually CPU installation
it should be noted that LGA 2011 CPUs
never come with a stock heatsink I
believe you can actually buy and Intel
om heatsink although the cost of it and
the performance of it makes like
basically don't buy it please yeah it
makes no sense whatsoever just get a
nice aftermarket one or any aftermarket
one and you'll be better off with that
so you can see the LGA 2011 chip is
quite large but installs in much the
same way that you would have come to
expect if you've
are installed and Intel CPU before in
LGA socket so there's a little golden
triangle on that corner of the CPU right
there and then there's a corresponding
triangle on the socket itself now it is
a little bit different in that it has to
retention arms so you lift up the one
that okay basically you can't take out
the wrong one because if you pull on it
it's it's stuck so you take out the one
with the with the hook then you take out
the one with the kink in the middle of
it then once that's done you can lift
out the entire hold down plate position
the CPU inside the socket okay make sure
it's in there then put this down put
them back down in the order that they
were originally removed in and remove
the cover I only recommend removing the
cover once you are done doing the things
that you're doing all right so we've got
some included thermal compound and I do
put a little bit more on LGA 2011 CPU
simply because they're larger and the
dies under the heat spreader are larger
than the LGA LGA 1155 1156 or 1150 CPUs
now here goes this cooler so you can see
we've got a nice shiny surface on the
bottom it's all brand new it still never
a bad idea to clean things off with
alcohol but we're not going to worry too
much about that in this case for
mounting hardware at least this this
cooler has an extremely straightforward
mounting system this is what one of the
things I like about LGA 2011 it's it's
got a backplate built in which means
that many coolers are just a matter of
aligning the LGA 2011 screw with the
built-in backplate and screwing them in
you can see the springs on there are
going to make sure that the tension is
correct so you should be able to go all
the way to the end of the stopper
tightening in a cross pattern not
tightening any of the screws fully until
you are until you have all of them
mostly tight so here we go
okay we're back so diesel has seen fit
to actually help me with this since it's
his machine that I'm building right now
so all we got to do is go ahead and put
these under the little
hold on do I do that right oh boy okay
this is this is pretty finicky after
careful consultation of the manual we
realized we had the fan upside down so
we flipped it around installed
everything completely the opposite way
and now it makes an awful lot more sense
we should also you know since the whole
point of this is we don't want it to be
super loud you install the little rubber
strips that are included so those should
keep some of the vibrations from the
fans from being passed to the heatsink
itself so there we go
by fans I mean fan there's only one
singular grammar is important even
though the world today doesn't seem to
think so
I really am getting old let's go ahead
and hook those on so it should be noted
that many heat sinks have this whole
feature where there's a groove here that
you can hook the wire clip into however
most of them have some leeway and
flexibility in terms of where you can
hook them on to not this heat sink so
these ones are straight these ones are
grooved the wire only goes where the
wire goes and that is it
so I usually tie the CPU fan cable into
a bit of a little knot so that it
doesn't get in the way of anything
before plugging it into the fan header
so here's Diesel's x79 shuttle pc which
was actually really hot at the back here
because he was just editing on it so the
CPU sockets right under there quite
toasty this was serving us perfectly
well except that limited expansion so
there's that Quadro there's that 10
gigabit nic how do we add something that
augments the CUDA capabilities of the
system well we can't because it only has
the two expansion slots so that's really
the only reason why we're changing this
out for something else so here's the
here's the guts I'm actually pulling the
RAM right now more than anything else
and slick took my screwdriver so I can
only take out thumb screws at the moment
you almost done almost all right so
there we'll do a tour of this to stall
for time so there's that single slot
quadrille 4000 that gives us up to ten
bit 10 bit output right yeah mind you we
only have any bit Pam
at best we have a PA to 4/6 here it's
ten bit I thought was a bit oh okay well
there you go apparently we have a 10 bit
panel so that's where diesel does all of
his all of his color work and go ahead
and pull these out there's that 10
gigabit NIC that gives him pretty much
unbought all necked access to our raid
array oh man this thing's hot holy cow
ow it says right on it it's hot don't
touch it so now we know all right so
here's our RAM guys please do note that
even though it might not seem like it I
am grounding myself before I touch
sensitive components so you'll usually
ground yourself on chassis or power
supply or some some large piece of metal
is usually adequate if you were going to
do things properly you'd want to use an
anti-static wrist strap whether you put
it around your wrist or your ankle is
totally up to you so here's our
quad-channel kingston valueram memory I
really don't on our internal machines
here we can install this in the rampage
I really don't believe in spending a ton
of money on fancy memory because I have
not observed a huge performance
difference however there are
environments where you will see better
performance from better memory ECC would
probably be a recommended upgrade for
this machine or well for a rendering
workstation I don't know that the round
page board supports ECC memory but ECC
memory wouldn't be a bad idea for long
renders where you don't want any errors
you know causing it to stop working you
know if you're running a lot of
virtualized if you're doing a lot of
virtualization faster memory can
definitely benefit you but I mean for
most of these workloads more memory is
still kind of King more than anything
else so here are the drives I just had
dummy ones before that I was using as
placeholder so these are going to come
out and this machine is actually going
to be inherited by b-roll so we're going
to find some lesser RAM and lesser
graphics card to put in there and then
b-roll can make do with the on-board
networking
ha ha b-roll eyes got his headphones on
he can't hear me
so this case is really very Frankenstein
it's been used a lot of times for a lot
of different builds and I don't have
half of the screws so it's just like
random screws that are just jammed into
places but I always end up back with
this case because it's extremely
versatile it fits long graphics cards
they're reasonably long graphics cards I
hope all the graphics cards fit oh man
this would be a good time to find that
out as opposed to later on down the line
so we'll pull out the wind force card I
don't know that I would have necessarily
chosen a wind force card for this
particular rig if if given a choice but
I mean I'm not going to I'm not going to
discard the wind force card and then
like go buy another one separately oh
wow yeah that isn't even close so we're
going to have to pull out the drive
cages I guess in order to have that card
fit what I would I normally probably
would have rather done well there's an
takes on the side but I would have
rather gone with a blower style cooler
that exhausts everything out of the case
but you know you make do with what you
have I guess you know if we have to use
that gtx 780 then we can but usually i
recommend when forth cards for more of
an open case design where there's a lot
more space I don't need the front
firewire cable still so I had
disconnected that during a previous
build and for that matter I don't need
the front audio either because the five
and a quarter inch Bay here this is what
often urged me about these things is
they're like yeah we want you to have
all the i/o in the front of your case
like why would I need a nut what case
doesn't have front audio and what
motherboard has you know two hookups for
it so why are you giving me this I don't
need this I want a card reader USB 3 II
Sadow's fine
but stuff words like a hundred percent
going to replicate something that your
case already had just kind of kind of
irks me so anyway we don't need the
front audio there so we're just going to
use the hook up the front USB 2 and the
front sort of power reset all that good
stuff
so the next stage now that we've
stripped everything out of the case is
probably to install the i/o shield so
I'm just get all four sides just like
that all the standoffs are already in
this case so I don't really have to
worry about moving them around or
anything like that micro ATX is quite a
bit more
well more standard than ATX in terms of
where the standoffs go some ATX boards
particularly a few years ago had you
know standoffs missing or standoffs
added compared to other ones so you had
to be a little bit careful to make sure
that you don't short out your board by
accidentally having a standoff installed
somewhere where you don't need one it's
actually a lot less important to have
all the standoffs installed versus not
having any extras installed extras are
really really terrible
so once the i/o shields in what we got
to do is grab that their motherboard so
this you guys are going to see why I
needed to have a low-profile CPU cooler
there is not going to be a lot of space
once we install our power supply which I
have misplaced there it is there's not
going to be a lot of space once we have
our power supply installed under there
so even the even that stock LGA 2011
cooler I don't think is going to fit in
this config so now we screw in the
motherboard I don't remember which which
type of screws it uses so the trick that
I usually use is start with a small one
so those are the ones that are threaded
for optical drives often motherboard
standoffs and then if those ones don't
stay in then switch to a coarser thread
one which are the ones that are threaded
for hard drives for example so we'll go
with this guy
and you can see that that is indeed
holding so it looks like this
motherboard uses the smaller threads or
this case uses smaller threads so I'm
trying to figure out how to get the
drives in here because I have to take
out the drive mounting cage I'm stuck
with one of a few different options so I
can either just like bolt the bolt I
mean the SSD I'm not worried about that
one could just kind of hang out inside
the case as long as it's like velcro to
something but hard drives I tend to
prefer a more stable mount
so I was thinking what I could do is I
could grab some silicone Isolators that
I'd salvaged from another case and maybe
just mounted in the bottom here by
drilling some holes through the bottom
of the case or another option would be
to mount it in the five and a quarter
inch Bay in a similar fashion in fact I
think that might actually work best
because then I could just take the SSD
and this one chuck them in there and
hopefully I would actually still even be
it yeah I think so I think I can even
still fit my five and a quarter inch
card reader thing I run all these
through here man give me a lot of cables
in here it's a good thing we're using a
modular power supply what is that
Oh apparently i/o diesel like five
hundred dollars because my camera broke
his lenses or something so he's quietly
sneaking that onto my desk before he
goes it's like awesome alright so there
we go
yep it looks like I'm going to be able
to fit all that stuff in there without
too much trouble I really don't like how
little room there is for airflow around
that velociraptor though so I still
might opt to put it down here this is
kind of ridiculous I've I've never seen
anything like this before but this multi
multifunction front panel thing actually
comes with its own self-tapping like
plastic screws that go into some special
holes that are just plastic and are not
threaded at all it apparently uses a
little tiny Phillips head bit so I'm
going to have to grab a different bit
unbelievable sometimes you just
encounter like the weirdest stuff that
just has no right to exist and you just
kind of go okay well whatever when I'm
building machines for my own my own
personal use or for internal use here at
Linus Media Group it's very rare that
you'll catch me putting all the screws
in especially for things like you know a
front panel card reader two screws is
fine you know you don't have to you
don't have to attach every you don't
have to weld everything to the case
unless it's something where there's like
you know a safety reason or a
reliability reason that it needs to be
attached incredibly well so I'll just
put in on the corners although it could
be argued that I should probably put in
all four of these because they're like
these weird special custom screws that
I'll probably never encounter ever again
so if I were to lose them then I would
never be able to do a proper
installation of this thing with all four
screws so there you go I'll at least put
them in a little bit so that they'll
stay there and not come out I do have
some new ideas for how to mount the hard
drive well not really new ideas but I've
went I've gone and obtained the hardware
so I grabbed some awesome screws so
these are hard drive screws that have a
non threaded portion in the middle so I
don't know even know if you guys can see
that at all but whatever anyway and some
silicone or rubber Isolators so I'm
going to put some holes in the bottom of
the case and I am going to mount that
hard drive down here in the bottom I'm
going to end up with a ridiculous amount
of front panel IO stuff connected so HD
audio goes into the AAFP over here
that's one of the things I also like
about this board it has a great onboard
audio solution so when he's working on
audio stuff which evidently he does
apparently some point in time you know
the the quality of it isn't going to be
just so horrible that it's unusable I
mean a lot of the time the issue with
onboard audio solutions is less to do
with even that the quality is terrible
which it usually is but often more to do
with that the drivers are terrible and I
would have higher expectations than that
from something like an rog supreme fx3
audio solution so there you go that's
one of the reasons to justify a high end
board if you really need to do that for
yourself I mean really the reason for us
going with the high end board for this
is more to do with just we want the
utmost in terms of reliability I could
kind of considered overclocking it and
so that was that was one of the reasons
why we've gone with an rog board i mean
particularly on a higher end socket like
LGA 2011 you're going to expect to get
better overclocking Headroom out of out
of a better board with the
consumer-grade platforms it's less less
of a
actor from what I've seen in the last
couple Jen's um yeah I don't know not
much else to say at the moment so I'm
just plugging in all the front panel
stuff so that was my front panel
connectors they're labeled on the board
I mean those little things high-end
boards those convenient creature and
comfort features that you don't really
get on the low-end stuff where normally
you'd have to go look in the manual or
something like that because of the
unique configuration with our five and a
quarter inch Bay device and the fact
that this board has four or this case
has four front panel USB 2 ports we're
going to end up with a total of six
front USB ports which is great because
he really uses a lot of them so we're go
ahead and plug those in down here and
I've got a phone call so I'm going to go
ahead and take that oh how disappointing
i miscounted the number of front USB
plug in devices that I had versus
headers so actually two of the ports on
the front will be dead so that the card
reader can get the USB connection that
it needs that's a shame and it comes on
its own full block here even though
actually only for the pins are populated
so it could have in theory supported at
least one more port but oh well
cable management here is going to be a
bit of a bit of a trick just because all
those cards have to be installed somehow
I usually cut these off these days these
this is the old AC 97 onboard audio pins
or wires or whatever you want to call
them so if you're not going to use them
which you're not unless you're going to
install like unlike a Pentium 3 computer
or something and just you can just cut
them off because otherwise they can be
in the way of things just make sure you
don't cut them off in such a way that
they're going to short out on each other
or anything like that so this gives us a
lot less room for that brilliant
harddrive mounting strategy that I'd
come up with which could make things a
little bit challenging maybe what we can
do is we can take all these wires and we
can actually manage them up here off of
off of sort of ground level so that we
don't get in the way of everything so if
we just kind of tuck everything over
here we should still have space for the
long card which I've decided is going to
go in the third PCI Express slot so
that's a full 16 X slot so full
bandwidth yeah yeah and there we go so
we should have room for that and the
Quadro should fit just fine
where there's a little bit less room so
that one will go right there like that
yep
should be just dandy okay so here I'm a
bawling approximately where on the
bottom I want to drill the holes for the
hard drive I don't know off the top of
my head what the spacing is so what I
did is I marked approximately where I
want one of them to go with sort of
landmarks of junk that goes through and
just making sure that things like this
that are poking through are going to be
interfering with anything so apparently
we'll sit about there but I'll do is
I'll measure this out and drill holes so
wish me luck with that I don't recommend
drilling holes in a system with
components already installed in it but
there are things you can do to prevent
it from being as much of a problem so
you can put masking tape over it so that
the shavings don't go flying all over
the place
oriented so that they fall away from the
components and all that but really
please don't do that
in general alright so hopefully these
are approximately right I hope yeah I
still have audio oh here we go
Oh went to the moment no I'm just
kidding all right next hole
okay number two and I was only able to
put in three because one of them ended
up under this foot so we'll just see how
this goes
okay no idea if these are going to align
or not but the only way to find out for
certain is to measure before you do I
mean just try things all right here we
go where are the holes where do they go
there's one sort of it's hard to see
here wait wait for it yeah that's not a
hole hmm that's interesting
ah yes I see the problem now right I
moved it further down because I didn't
want to interfere with the SATA ports
other than that there's nothing hanging
off the right-hand edge of the board
that would interfere with plugging
things into the hard driver that the
hard drive would prevent from operating
correctly all right so there's one of
them so one of them definitely lined up
with something all right so the idea
being that ah that's a shame that's the
biggest drill bit in slicks kit so
that's not big enough to put these
through without the threading
unfortunately which means that I might
have to go back to the back to my own
house to get my own kit to do that
okay well we'll continue this when we're
ready oh not that one almost lines up so
that should be good enough for our
purposes here so I did without and
remove the motherboard so yeah the mess
of all the filings around here is less
of an issue I was able to find another
wider bit so I did end up being able to
drill the holes that I need so my
brilliant plan is screws through here
okay I've only got three still just
because that foot was in the way then
I'm going to put the rubber Isolators
on the other side then I'm going to
attempt to screw in the drive so this is
going to be a bit of a balancing act
here I've gone ahead and put the board
back in off camera now so that's done oh
wow yeah because all of these have to go
on I hope you guys can see this yeah all
of these have to go on and they all have
to kind of stay in place at the same
time which isn't going to be easy it's
okay these are the challenges that make
PC building fun as opposed to you know
just buying things that all work
together in the first place yeah that's
for noobs something no actually this
just makes it more stressful but
whatever alright so we're going to go
ahead and put that drive on there now
Wow worked okay I don't need to mush the
crap out of those Isolators just got to
make sure that it's reasonably firmly
mounted and there we have it
the hard drive is now mounted actually
pretty darn securely I don't have as
much clearance over on this side if I as
I had hoped for the connectors but
that's okay I'll just go find a left
angle connector for the SATA port and
then we'll figure out power can't be
that complicated and there you have it
alright so I did manage to get just
regular straight SATA connectors in
there although it's extremely tight so
we'll add this to the long list of
things I wouldn't recommend doing about
this build I got my industrial-strength
velcro so I'm going to go ahead and
attach the SSD I decided rather than
using up a five and a quarter inch bay I
mean the whole the whole you know notion
of drives must go where the manufacturer
says they should go to me that
really that really that really bothers
me drive should go wherever is most
convenient and awesome so I'm going to
go ahead and put some velcro on the back
of this drive so that will give me the
option to add an optical drive later
should I should I choose to by doing
this this way so I'm adding sticking the
velcro side to here and then I'm going
to go ahead and I'm going to put this
SSD kind of here ish kind of here-ish
know I'm going to put it here there we
go
so the SSD will go there that separates
it enough from that velociraptor that I
don't have to worry about heat or
anything like that because I had thought
about just sticking it straight to the
top of the Velociraptor but then I
changed my mind about that don't want
the SSD to have its lifespan affected by
its neighbor like I do can you guys
believe I have to sit like right across
from diesel my desk here at work right
across from him I mean the music he
listens to he listens to Bieber so for
all those of you who think he's cool now
I guess that is pretty cool oh wait so
all of our front panel connectors are
all attached I'm starting I've wired up
the drives now it's pretty much time to
get the expansion cards in here no see
now you've got that song stuck in my
head
wow this side this case is a knot it has
seen better days let's just say that the
spacing of like the PCI bracket isn't
even right anymore that's the thing
about aluminum cases is they often they
often Bend in pretty spectacular ways so
oh this is a PCI okay well here's a good
tip for you guys PCIe 8 X cards can be
installed in PCIe 4x slots you might get
slightly less overall bandwidth
available to the card I don't remember
on these 10 gigabit cards whether they
actually needed all of the available
bandwidth I think each PCIe ah 2x Lane
our pcie 2.0 Lane is around 250
megabytes per second so we should be
pretty close to all that it can can
actually but there you go I ideally I
would put it in another slot but in
order to get all my cards in here I'm
talking to work so this case has kind of
a unique fan arrangement here which I
actually had turned around before so I
had this as exhaust and this is intake
but I'm going to put those back in the
default configuration so I can bring
nice fresh air down to particularly
these ones there's vents in the side the
wind force can take advantage of but
particularly these ones I want this fan
to get nice fresh air and I want this
heatsink to get some incidental cooling
as well so last but not least the wind
force gtx 780 for cuda I can see diesel
droolin over there about the fast output
times you're not drooling are you it's
okay because I can't see you either so
everything I said was a lie everything I
said was a lie except the part about
installing this graphics card there we
go so one screw I actually only had
three screws in there so I'm just going
to find another random one there we go
and put that in there alright so that my
friends is one monkey jam packed card
configuration love it alright so I turn
the fans around you can see right here
is where the power supply sits on the
other side so this piece of steel this
piece is aluminum since it doesn't
really do anything other than hold a
couple of fans there's no actual
structural integrity of the case that's
being taken care of I'm pretty sure this
isn't how you're supposed to put it in
but yeah I'm pretty sure a lot of the
stuff we've done with this build isn't
how you're supposed to put it in now
this bracket uses those weird
countersunk screws that only silver
stone and like at some other sort of
weird manufacturers seem to use and I
only have like two of them so I'm going
to put this in as best as I can without
having to use too many of them if you
don't use the countersunk ones though
then the the case cover doesn't sit
right so you just kind of have to
you kind of have to use them maybe this
one will work we'll try this one so
that's pretty low profile so there we go
now we have our cooling fans in place I
just got to find somewhere to tuck these
this is a this is a working machine not
a show machine so cable management is a
bit of a secondary concern as long as
it's out of the way of airflow I don't
get too uptight about it and stuff like
this so there we go yeah we've got nice
unrestricted air flow from our intakes
to our graphics cards and it's pretty
much time to get the power supply in
here now with these smaller form factor
systems I often find it's easier to
install the modular cables first and
then actually install the power supply
so I'm going to start with I really wish
these would stay under that USB cable
that is supposed to be kind of anchoring
them I mean I could cable tie them down
which would be a better way to do this
but trying to get this done so that
diesel can get back to work because it
is now the next day Wow
the 780 takes to eight pins today I'll
do that I can't even remember all right
so I'm going to run this through over
here then over here
because once we bought the power supply
in this case it's going to be a total
nightmare to get my hands in anywhere so
just get it all done now make life easy
for ourselves I mean as easy as it can
be when you're just making your own
drive mounts as you go and sort of
playing by no one's rules except your
own not even your own alright I think
there's that yeah so this part this is
one of the things I like about be quiet
power supplies is they tend to come with
sort of a bunch of different options in
terms of the modular cables so it comes
with a dual PCIe and a single PCIe on a
550 watt power supply I think the
manufacturers expectation is that you're
using one of those two options but we're
going to go ahead and use both I mean
they give you the modular connections on
the power supply for it so you know they
asked for it I guess
my expectation for a dark power power
supply is also that it's going to be
able to handle pretty much near its peak
output at any given time so I'm not
worried about blowing it up or anything
like that next up we've got our wow
that's a long cable this is where those
short cable kits that guys like
silverstone sell come in handy because
this is an awfully long cable and the
only real way to cable management is
going to be to check it back here or
something or or potentially actually we
could throw it over here with all these
other cables near the hard drive that'll
probably work but it did if we were
relying on any airflow from the front of
the case which this case doesn't have
then this isn't really something that I
would want to do too much so there's
that one
and finally the 24 pin connector is pre
attached to the power supply so we're
pretty much ready to put the power
supply in and find out if this system
works at all it comes with its own
special screws I'll find those and right
at exactly the moment where I had found
some other thumb screws that also had
nice long threads on them Diezel found
the be quiet thumb screws that have even
longer threads so that you can really
you know put them on there and get that
power supply installed I like the noise
isolating strip I wish that it didn't
reduce compatibility with other screws
but you know sometimes that's the
sacrifice you have to make so there you
go so those are installed which brings
us back to the inside wow this is
starting to get heavy with those
graphics cards in there
so that brings us to the inside so we're
going to tuck our 24 pin actually no
we're going to plug in the modular
cables that we have here first so try
and get you guys a decent view of that
so PCI Express we have four different
PCI Express plug options here again the
thing with the whole like options on the
be quiet power supply is that I ask that
I quite like next we've got one four
drives alright
oh actually let's do oh cool it has fan
plugs too so we could actually using
manual fan control in the front of the
case but if we weren't using that
then we can have the power supply
control our fans which is kind of neat
actually all right so the CPU connector
goes over here most modular power
supplies these days use the same plugs
for the p4 connector or p8 connector
whatever you want to call it and PCI
Express but this one doesn't it has a
specific spot for it I wonder if it has
to do with the way that the rails are
distributed because it is not a single
rail power supply it is a Multi rail
power supply so we've got that we can
tuck our 24 pin up here in the five and
a quarter inch Bay at least until we
wanted to install a five and a quarter
inch drive maybe at some point in the
future and then what I'm going to do
this is something that I often do with
builds is I use cables to cable manage
so I'm going to use the 24 pin to hold
all that other stuff out of the way of
the CPU fan so that there's nothing
interfering with it so if I can just get
in there a little bit better
I should have plugged this in just like
I did with all the other cables first
before I actually installed the power
supply fully because the cave was so
long I could have gotten away with that
even though it's pre attached this is
one of the reasons why full modular can
be nice even if it's not a necessity
because it does allow you to fully wire
up your system before you actually have
to put the power supply in it or if
you're RMA in your system or your power
supply for example it can be a great way
to not have to actually rewire anything
when the new one arrives back which is
neat as well I'm having a little bit of
difficulty here yep having some
difficulty a little trick guys if you
plug the four pin in first then the 20
pin will often sit on top of it and lock
it into place
depending on how the cable is designed
and that is how this one is designed so
that's in there now and then the last
thing we need is it would be just like
be quiet to include something like this
but I need like a single molex oh they
got a single SATA alright so I was close
and
a single molex look at that I love it I
don't need any more than that so I'm
just going to plug in my dual SATA
connector for the drives down there oh
trying to get you guys a view of this
but it's not working too well so that's
going to go into drives number five and
then my other my molex connector is
going to go into drives number four and
I'll be using that to power my front
panel five and a quarter inch Bay device
which is going to power my fans and my
built-in card reader and evidently all
the other things one thing I didn't show
you guys is I did plug in the SATA
connector for the eSATA and the front
panel so all the i/o options will be had
with this particular machine very cool
there we go not the greatest cable
management I've ever done but lots of
clearance around the CPU cooler which
hopefully works otherwise we're gonna
have to pull the power supply out and
swap that out for something a little bit
taller perhaps and hopefully ample
cooling for those graphics cards and
hopefully enough power so there's a lot
of things to test once we fire this bad
boy up
so it's moment of truth time we're going
to find out if she boots up I really
hope we get into the OS because we don't
have time to reformat before packs so
yeah if there's any kind of hardware
conflicts or anything like that oh we've
got an ROG logo that's a good sign
there's our 10 gigabit NIC so that's
detected
fan control seems to be working alright
so we've got that going here new CPU
installed press f1 to run set up 32 gigs
of ram both of our hard drives are
detected this is all looking pretty
pretty solid so far I've wonder around
seven let's make sure we don't have any
sort of completely weird this is
something I really recommend doing right
oh that CPU is at that 57 degrees
already that is a big that is a big
problem at idle we should be not sitting
at 57 degrees
hmm that I'm not happy about I wonder if
there's anything we could do fan wise to
be a bit more aggressive although often
a very high idle temperature actually
indicates a bad mount so we may want to
take it right off and then put it back
on and see if I see if that alleviates
the problem well let's find out if
she'll boot either way I mean sixty
degrees is hot but it's not it's not
it'll brick immediately if we go into an
OS hot so that's a shame let's find out
reboots I guess you guys can come along
for the ride if you want we're pretty
much done here I was just thinking uh
because diesel and I were having a
conversation about the irony of Amy
Winehouse making a hit song this is
actually his observation not mine I
can't take credit for this I would blame
or whichever making a hit song about not
going to rehab and then dying of drug
related complications and I was actually
thinking so this is my contribution to
the to the discussion that the the name
irony should actually be different
because irony has iron in it which rusts
and deteriorates over time but irony I
believe will be just as delicious a
thousand years from now as it was a
thousand years ago when dinosaurs and
their hubris okay I think for dunya
so rendering oh okay we got away well
either way we're into the OS so I'm not
too worried about it at this point so
that's great the upgrade worked we just
got a diagnose our CPU oh yeah we got to
find out about power consumption as well
so we're sitting at 160 watts idle right
now so we'll be back so this is a bit of
a public service announcement on why ps2
keyboards are still important and ps2
ports are still important because they
don't require any drivers so we boot it
up again and we're still not getting our
keyboard and mouse drivers loaded now
ps2 doesn't support hot hot swap on many
are hot plugging or whatever you would
call it on many motherboards so we're
going to reboot this and then we should
be able to use the ps2 keyboard to at
least navigate into the OS where the
drivers are more likely to be picked up
and installed all right so I'm pretty
sure at this point that it's not a bad
mount just because it doesn't really
seem to be behaving like one but there's
only one way to know for sure what I did
determine is that there is enough room
in here for the stock cooler that we
happen to have one of so we're going to
go ahead and install that but once we
pull it off we'll be able to tell for
sure
if it was a bad mount or if it's just
not quite up to the task of an extreme
edition on LGA 2011 here now I think I
have some bad news I think I can get
this one out but I don't think I'm going
to be able to get that stock cooler in
without removing this brace here so I
really really hope that that doesn't end
up being the case but we got to work
with what you got yeah see that that's a
perfectly fine thermal paste application
there so I really don't think that was
the issue it's not too much not too
little just right as Papa Bear would say
or Goldilocks or whoever it was that it
was Goldilocks apparently okay well
whatever man so I'm gonna you know
speaking of perfect thermal paste
applications I'm going to commit a sin
here and I'm going to just kind of plunk
this on top of the
old thermal paste once I can find
something to wipe it off with do you
have any TP really I stole it I call
rubbish on that okay that does sound
like e all right time to put a beefier
cooler in here so I've at least cleaned
off the base so we're going to go ahead
and then I guess we'll install it first
I really hope this fits our above a
screwdriver fits and I'm able to get in
there and screw it in come on come on
come on Gil oh I think we got this nice
oh except that wire that's under the
heat sink that'll be a problem at some
point in the future here in like four
minutes okay same thing across pattern
this side first remember going in at an
angle is okay as long as you're careful
and gentle as long as you don't cross
thread the screw what did you guys think
I was talking about okay one two three
and four there we go so we have a
slightly better cooler in there now it's
still a stock cooler still nothing
special about it but at least it should
work at stock speeds without sort of
running too hot or anything like that so
we're going to fire this bad boy up back
up once I've closed it up again and take
a baseline reading of the temperatures
and the BIOS again to make sure that
it's running all right okay so our CPUs
still running a little bit on the toasty
side but the funny thing is it was
showing up as lower in real temp than it
is in the BIOS here so maybe it's some
weird rog feature I've never heard of
either way I'm going to just kind of go
for gold here and we're going to go your
CPU level up which is a soos is super
simple overclocking utility thing we're
going to go for 4.25 gigahertz just to
see what happens so wish us luck with
that and as long as as long as she's
stable and doesn't exceed the
maximum power we can draw from the wall
which is going to be around 600 watts
because we're looking at about 90%
efficiency on this power supply then we
should be okay let's see if it even like
boots now fans ramping up we set it to
turbo mode for the automatic fan speed
control see you at the LS all right so
we're finally done the rig upgrade
overclocking was a complete no-go so
we're trying to figure out how to liquid
cool this thing at some point here
that's dock cooler just know it's know
we might be able to turn clock speed up
a little bit but we're not able to use
any of Isis's CPU level up stuff so now
to make sure that it can handle fully
loading all the components inside
we're running prime95 in place whatever
it is the one that does a lot of CPU and
some memory so we're sitting at around
320 watts at the wall now we're going to
run the Ariane bench 64 to load up both
of our graphics cards with a CUDA
benchmark here to find out what our
absolute max power consumption is going
to be with this system so there you have
it guys I knew it was going to be
borderline this isn't the first time
we've run this so that five hundred and
four Watts we're seeing right now is not
quite the peak the highest I saw was
around five hundred and sixty watts
which means when you factor in that the
power supply is probably only around 83
to 88 percent efficient at this kind of
a load means that we are actually
nowhere near the maximum load of the
power supply with that said you should
allow for a power supply to age a little
bit and become less efficient and less
capable over time but particularly with
very high quality units it's a much less
of an issue so a dark power Pro should
be just fine for that so we're calling
it good on the power supply side we got
to figure out better CPU cooling at some
point but other than that the new
workstation is ready to rock so don't
