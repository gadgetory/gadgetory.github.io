you by D brand their grip case and prism
screen protectors give you 360 degree
coverage for even Lynas drop proof
protection here we are
Asus hasn't even set up yet in here in
fact this is like they kind of pulled me
aside from the pre briefing thing and
they were like okay yeah that stuff's
really cool but like come on in here we
got this and I was like that's an ROG
Strix Skaar - why are you pulling me in
here for this everything about this is
like basically normal strict star stuff
so you got a bunch of ventilation for
your cooling you got a bunch of heat
pipes and you got a bunch of heat sinks
because you got powerful graphics six
core 8750 H processor you've got like a
bunch of i/o SD card reader and you know
RGB backlit keyboard and is this
individually backlit yeah individually
backlit cool that's good stuff alright
so okay so we got we got RGB you know
asus living up to their reputation
clearly no Thunderbolt but lots of
display we got you know wired networking
and all that cool stuff and they're like
no no no no hold on a second Linus don't
walk away yet cuz I was half I was
halfway I was halfway out of the room
and like look you guys don't even
respect me enough to put away your
packing materials before CRA seuss are
say soos breath is hiding he's hiding
back there cuz he's like oh no I'm gonna
get in all kinds of trouble for this but
he's like no come back come back because
this thing is what I have been asking
for for so long so first of all they've
added some better rigidity so the thing
with Strix for asus is they can't seem
to decide if it's a premium brand or if
it's kind of like their value brand
because they've got rog like the
high-end rog and then Strix was like
kind of this value one but then they're
like no no it's like it's for gaming
it's premium and they're finally taking
that seriously so they've added more
metal to the bottom of the chassis so
this is now a really rigid chassis like
it makes the overall device feel quite a
lot better
still a little flimsy up here room for
improvement there but you know baby
steps right but the big thing the big
thing I've been asking for is watch this
holy crap so for years now I've been
saying the same thing that actually
apples been saying and we don't agree on
everything for sure but you don't need
higher resolution once you get to the
point where you can't distinguish the
individual pixels and so while 4k
displays make a ton of sense if you've
got a 32 inch monitor because at the
distance you'd sit you would easily be
able to make out the pixels on cue HD or
something like that for laptops this
this race to 4k has just been
frustrating for me we're sucking up
extra battery we're making the screens
dimmer because the closer you pack the
pixels actually the harder it is to push
the backlight through them like we're
doing all these counterproductive things
when what we should be focusing on is
refresh rate this to my knowledge is the
first laptop in the world with a 240
Hertz display and not just that but
check this out so it's using a sharp XO
panel that has among the best
anti-ghosting that I have seen certainly
the best I've seen on a laptop look at
this like it's hard to appreciate it 30
frames per second through a YouTube
compression filter but I can read this
text as I'm moving it around on the
screen that would have been unthinkable
on anything but a CRT in the past I mean
maybe a high-end TN panel but that's not
what this this this is this is an egg's
OpenAL it's not like just like bad
viewing angle junk check this out
so this is the closest thing I've ever
seen to a zero compromises mobile gaming
experience because high refresh rate is
a true competitive advantage where
higher resolution is not and speaking of
competitive advantage unfortunately they
had to have like someone directly over
my shoulder the entire time to make sure
that I didn't run any of these
tantalizing benchmarks over
but this is actually going to be
equipped with an RT X 2080 max Q design
or whatever in videos latest you know
nomenclature for that is now a Seuss
can't tell me under pain of death
what kind of performance we could expect
for this compared to a regular RT X 2080
but if I had to go out on a limb I'd say
well the max Q ones last gen were about
10% lower so I wouldn't be surprised if
we saw something along those lines now
there's still room for improvement here
this webcam bad terrible not only is it
on the bottom its off-center clearly
they expect absolutely no one to use it
but other than that the keyboard feels
better than last gen trackpad acceptable
could be bigger but this is looking
pretty freakin sick so my stylus fell
out but it should be noted that that is
the only damage that my phone sustained
so this is the D brand grip it features
super clicky buttons it's really grippy
it's got precise cutouts for all your
various things be they fingerprint
sensors cameras or whatever the case may
be and of course fantastic impact
resistance as you might expect for D
brand every grip case has a customizable
spot on the back so you can put any D
brand skin you'd like on the back and
then as for the front their prism screen
protector is kind of unbelievable so it
feels very glassy on the front but it's
not glass like there's this demo they
had me do that made me feel very
uncomfortable hammering nails in with a
phone that had a prism installed on the
front and somehow the screen survived I
thought like I love D brand
they're our bros but I thought they must
have kind of fudged it a little bit when
they did the demo but they didn't and
it's you should just go check it out at
the link in the video description so
thanks for checking out this video guys
