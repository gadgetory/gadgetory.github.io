data's spectryx dat ddr4 memory as
they're calling it the world's first RGB
ddr4 memory with hybrid liquid air
cooling system using a combination of a
liquid heatsink and an aluminum heatsink
to deliver effective thermal cooling
water-cooled memory welcome my friends
to manufacturers say this this is
water-cooled memory throughout this
video liners will refer to the liquid as
water this is inaccurate the liquid is

Origin PC offers beautiful custom
laptops and desktops including their Evo
15s that weighs only four point three
pounds is under an inch thick and
features up to a smooth 144 Hertz
display with the gtx 1070 max q be sure
to check out their latest offerings at
the link in the video description well
we're off to a good start the shutdown
button doesn't work brilliant who needs
to shut down their computer anyway what
am I supposed to do now I could just
shart all over this stuff based on pure
principles of cooling theory because I
actually don't need to plug them in in
order to know that the water cooling on
them is really not doing anything but I
at least try to take manufacturers
claims somewhat seriously I want to give
them every opportunity to prove me wrong
here so what I'm gonna do is devise an
experiment one thing's for sure they
look pretty cool other than that they
have a red heat spreader
on an RGB round module on a more
positive note this is hours of fun this
little bubble oh this is interesting
it makes no meaningful thermal contact
outside of it looks like this part of
the spreader might go under there with
the actual memory chips let's start I
guess with the standard stuff then or no
let's make sure this stuff even boots up
first
show me the post all right now that
we're booted up let's go ahead and press
start on a stress system memory test
hopefully our FLIR camera will tell us
some interesting things about what's
going on here we can see the heat is
clearly concentrated directly over the
actual DRAM modules the second thing
that we can see is that my suspicion
that there was some kind of contact
between this medallion here and the
water cooling at the top was probably
not correct it looks like the only
places where heat is being transferred
up into the top chamber
are kind of over here and I'm not sure
why and then kind of over here so those
are almost the same temperature as the
spot directly over the chimps say you
can say if we look directly over top of
it the water cooling portion is still
quite cool okay so after a few minutes
of testing our thermals have stabilized
anywhere from around 47 to 50 degrees
depending on where exactly we're looking
on the spreader here but that's not that
interesting we were expecting that what
we did figure out that is interesting is
why we're seeing those little centers of
activity of thermal movement up here
that actually came from perusing a data
is very optimistic by the way diagram of
how these modules work so heat gets
generated by these drm packages right
here with you so far then it gets I
don't know it goes through these holes
I'm not sure what they're talking about
but there's that there's a heat spreader
here that then somehow theoretically
heat up or something anyway the point is
once the assembly is put together
there's an actual heat spreader portion
here and here that's causing those hot
zones on these sides the reason this one
doesn't work is because on a standard
ddr4 memory module there is no chip in
the middle so there's no heat for this
to carry away this is more efficient
than this chunk of metal so we're gonna
go ahead and throw my regular test bench
memory back in here and we'll compare
against that so we still need a few more
minutes with our other memory modules
here it looks like we're gonna end up
somewhere in the 40 to 40 something mid
range so it took a little longer thanks
to the additional thermal mass of these
Triton Z modules but we are back up to
anywhere between about 50 degrees and 47
degrees just like last time so the rules
of the game have not in fact changed Ram
doesn't really need cooling unless
you're you know extreme overclocking it
to break records and heat spreaders
don't really do a whole lot for it
regardless of the does
of them so what conclusion can we draw
about this thing then I guess the best
way I could describe it would be this
the water on the top of these RAM
modules it's not hurting anything it's
like homeopathic pills where they just
contain basically nothing but it's not
helping anything and as much as we love
our friends over in a data to say that
it is water-cooled it's a boat like it
would be for me to say that this CPU
with a bubble of water on the middle of
it is water cooled water does not
inherently cool anything you have to
have surface area that's why water
cooling still needs radiators that's why
heat sinks need fins and not just heat
pipes well that whole thing was
enlightening isn't learning fun
brilliant dot-org sure thinks so
brilliant is a problem-solving website
that teaches you to think like a
computer scientist by diving in and
doing things for yourself rather than
just trying to passively learn from
lectures and videos they believe that a
great education shows you how to solve
new and unfamiliar problems by using
critical reasoning skills with that said
you do need a toolkit and a framework in
order to work through things
fortunately they also provide you with
that so they'll take learning concepts
break them up into bite-sized pieces
present clear thinking in each part and
then build back up to an interesting
conclusion head over to brilliant org
