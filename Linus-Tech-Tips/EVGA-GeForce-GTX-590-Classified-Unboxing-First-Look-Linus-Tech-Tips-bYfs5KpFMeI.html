the box for the EVGA classified special
edition GeForce GTX 590 and I don't
already unboxed a 590 but I had I saw
this box in the back and actually
actually it didn't come in this one just
keep the camera pointed that way I'll
bring it over okay I saw it in a
warehouse and it was literally in this
box and I was like oh is that up it's
not a master carton of video cards maybe
there's like four inside and that
warehouse guy was like no that's one
video card I was like are you sure and
he's like yeah and I'm like okay because
I didn't believe him so I opened it and
sure enough it was one video card so
let's unveil it here da da da da so the
first thing we find inside is an EVGA
t-shirt made by Hanes so it's not even
like your cheap t-shirt that's a tagless
Hanes t-shirt go ahead and open that up
there Oh a nice heavy cotton on that too
and what's the size the size is XL well
that figures it's a little big on me but
you know I guess they figure your
typical GTX 590 gamers probably in Excel
ooh this is nice that's a really nice
mousepad actually look at that limited
edition it's a hard gaming surface got a
little bit of flex to it got a nice
rubber back so it's not going to slip
anywhere that's very nice actually nice
touch next we have done one of those
EVGA gaming posters with the skull on it
okay and we got some our phone here well
just phone look at that just phone okay
and we'll take out another piece of foam
pretty nice piece of foam for what it's
worth nice gray foam oh oh there's two
cards oh no there's not two cards no
okay I guess you can buy a kit with two
cards well this is just the one card kit
so we get a nice piece of foam as well
as
alright okay so let's look at the
accessories first we have two six pins
and one eight pin or rather two six pins
- what a pin we've got two of those so
if you have an SLI ready power supply
that's older and only has four 16.6 ten
PCIe connectors and you will still be
able to connect the classifieds to eight
pins we've got a mini DisplayPort to
full size display port adapter we have a
DVI to VGA to HDMI adapter as well as a
DVI to VGA adapter and for crying out
loud please don't use fijian on this
mode on this side okay okay attention
please allow the graphics card to cool
for a minimum of two minutes after
operation okay before removing it from
your system and here we have it this is
the GTX 590 classified limited edition
graphics card you know what this is
actually a little bit different from the
reference work I'll have to you know
what let me go get my reference card
I'll be back in a minute I'll show you
guys so two things okay first of all
EVGA z' backplate is clearly going to do
a better job of cooling the memory than
the stock two-piece back plate because
it is a single piece and so it just
plain has more surface area there's no
rocket science to it here okay second of
all EVGA seems to be one of the only
graphics card companies that is figured
out which way people install graphics
cards and their computers so they
install them like this which means that
all of this text is now right-side up
for you to read when it's installed in
your system very nice very nice touch
EVGA so let's go ahead and turn it over
and compare the other side to our
reference card which i think is going to
be quite similar yeah okay so now looks
pretty much the same so now I'm going to
take my reference card away and we are
going to focus on the EVGA classified so
this is a three gig graphics card it
features two GF 110 course so that is
two full fledged GPUs that are
same as the one that is used in the
NVIDIA GTX 580 okay now they are running
on an internal SLI configuration which
means that you don't get quite the full
performance of two of those chips but
you do get the excellent sli scaling in
many titles as well as support for all
of invidious key technologies such as
cuda physx obviously sli because it's
internal but also Quad SLI you can
actually run two of these bad boys in
the same system for even more graphics
performance 3d vision as well as 3d
vision surround so let's let's go on a
quick tour of the card so here's our sli
finger up here at the top here is some
more text that is right-side up when the
card is actually installed in your
system here is that little lit GeForce
logo so that actually lights up with
LEDs and it is functional if there's any
kind of problem with your card like if
you don't have the right power
connectors connected then it'll actually
flash so you can you can tell it there's
some kind of a problem instead of I
remember the first time I fired up GTX
our rather than 8800 GTX it squealed at
me like a pig and I couldn't figure out
what the heck was going on but it turned
out one of my PCIe adapters wasn't
plugged in right and that was the issue
so there's our 80 millimeter fan pulling
the unis ink that you can clearly see
down there and then inside the card you
can see there's one vapor chamber and -
I don't know if you can see that one -
vapor chambers with fins okay here on
the bottom you see our standard PCIe 16x
interface here at the back of the card
you can see some ventilation so that's
I'm going to be kicking her air out
towards the front of your case and then
here on the front of the part you see
some more ventilation as well as one of
the coolest features about this card so
the two GTX 580 well remember they're
not equivalent because it's the same GPU
has all the same functional units but
it's clocked a little bit lower in order
to get the power under control for a
dual GPU card but it has 2 DP use on it
which means you can actually drive for
displays off of the single card you can
run three displays on DVI for NVIDIA 3d
vision surround off of a
single card isn't that cool I think
that's pretty much it so thank you for
