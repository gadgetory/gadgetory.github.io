after dispatch got the call it was easy
enough to determine the cause of death
but the real mystery is why it happened
and maybe we could keep it from
happening again I've seen this kind of
thing before sometimes things get rough
they hit the ground never get up again
opening a shut case but this was
different
make yourself useful cool question the
owner the suspect claims it was
self-defense
I didn't mean to things got heated I had
to protect myself and call me crazy but
I believe there's more to it than that
the Vic was young well-built fast and
powerful a looker too this was a game in
notebook with all the latest PI's damn
shame looking on the bottom I could see
clear as day the plastic had melted
warped high performance comes at a cost
after all mobile processes can hit 80
degrees pair it with a discrete GPU that
he has to go somewhere
finally so here's what happens see the
suspect was playing a game of Bioshock
in his chair and the heat from the
notebook made him uncomfortable and the
straining his neck look him down for so
long
caused him to try to balance the
notebook on his knee and then
so it was fallen now this notebook is
still running when I hit the ground but
that didn't last for long now it was
already dying did he no scope of him so
it's one he left a hero for one that
combined a high-performance CPU running
hot you got a recipe for a long and
premature death this notebook is gonna
need it to make a similar inform if you
had a notebook cooler it could have
raised the notebook to a more
comfortable height and kept the hot
surface away from his skin the 180
millimeter fan would have kept it from
overheating all the time this could have
been prevented why didn't you use a
cooler I didn't know I didn't know no
coolers existing you do now welcome
Santa like to thank you guys for putting
up with my bad acting and my bad accent
and I'd also like to thank coolermaster
for sponsoring this fun little PSA about
the benefits of notebook coolers
featuring their SF 17 I hope you guys
liked this video give it a thumbs up if
you want to see more just like it and
give it a big old thumbs down if you
think it just plain sucked and you never
want to see anything like it ever again
oh yeah and as always don't forget to
