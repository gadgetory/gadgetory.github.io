we did recently where we disassembled an
8k red camera with the intention of
water cooling it and well we do intend
to do that eventually but you know baby
steps right so the first step is making
any water block and that is exactly what
we have in store for you guys today the
first-ever linus Media Group water block
except those ones they main scrapped
yours
Mack Weldon wants you to be more
comfortable so if you don't love your
first pair of underwear you can keep it
and get a full refund with their Tryon
guarantee use code tech tips 20 to get
20% off at the link below so we have we
have no we have no script and no
structure for this whatsoever then is
that do I understand this correctly yes
okay so step one drawing inspiration you
want to come over here David we actually
did a video a little while ago where we
bought a bunch of cheap water blocks off
like Aliexpress and some of them
actually are were so simple that we
looked at them and went well we could do
that with like you know half an hour in
SolidWorks and then you know a couple
hours of CNC time and that's exactly
what we did pretty much yeah
so this right here is even simpler than
what we did it's kind of smart how they
did it
and like it's really smart how cheap it
is to make this so if we look this is
just acrylic and it would just be like
six holes you're done so six holes and
then you tap to G 1/4 threads and
bippity Boppity finished okay and then
they don't even bother with doing
anything besides holes in the copper
because machining copper is a huge pain
in the butt so they just have another
piece of acrylic that's the right size
for this o-ring and don't even bother
with anything on the inside either wow
this is like actually less than a dollar
worth of materials pretty much yeah and
so we kind of took some inspiration from
that but it's it's too like easy even
for us like because we're going to need
to figure out how to properly machine
copper to do some of the stuff we're
doing later right so what have we done
for okay so this is the other end of the
spectrum yeah this is like pretty good
where would you say that lands so by
contrast this is a much more advanced
design so starting with the base it
requires machining on both the top and
bottom so you can see they've countered
the holes for these screws right here so
that you're not gonna even on a large
died CPU you're not going to just have
like screw raising the block away from
it so it can't transfer heat and then
it's actually got also much much finer
work than we see on our very very basic
just piece of copper here with these
little fine fins that kind of guide the
fluid as it goes across where the CPU
die would be underneath and then away
furthermore it's got a metal mid plate
so this is to add rigidity and allow
firm mountains ability across various
sockets and then it's got again double
sided machining work on the top here
that not only just sort of allows it to
be attached to the base but actually has
guides for the fluid flow to help make
it more efficient we're not really
aspiring to this at this point are we no
we're kind of getting half the way there
so they do have the o-ring groove and
those are actually really hard to
machine because you need super high
tolerances you mean in the groove low
tolerances yes you need super low
tolerances within this group because
otherwise I mean to put some perspective
on how important that is if your own
ring doesn't fit correctly you leak
water on your you know thousand dollar
computer or thirty thousand dollar
camera as it were we aren't going to be
able to get these kind of things
unfortunately could we have done any
kind of fins I could have potentially
got like so the bit that we used this is
our actual block here it was an eighth
of an inch and that's getting it in like
this groove right here is just a bit
over an eighth of an inch got it so
that's kind of like we could have like
two fins we do have finer bits but
running them in copper it isn't really
working at the moment so I don't know
I'm actually really stoked that we can
just simply a machine copper
I wasn't expecting us to get this far I
was thinking that we would start this
and the fit would get like half way in
and then gum up and explode like we
already have three more in the mail
because I thought that we're just going
to ruin a bunch so it might be
surprising but this is a huge success
for us okay a flat piece of copper with
an o-ring in it do you want a medal like
is it here okay so have you tried this
yet no so we have a couple more things
that we need to do we need to tap the
holes in here okay and in here so that
the fittings go in and the bolt can go
down and secure the whole thing together
okay and then we're pretty much good to
go okay so
peter-patter let's get out of it yeah
which one do you want to go up I want to
do the plexi first because that seems a
lot easier to replace if I hung it up
this is really ugly acrylic that's just
the machining marks there we could why
did we machine the top of it to make
sure that it's nice and flat when you
get a piece of acrylic you don't
necessarily know so we can't come okay
but we aren't are we well we are if it
leaves so here we go friends oh crap
I'm not putting enough pressure it's
kind of hard you okay oh I am shredding
this okay and you just needed more
pressure and the great news is that this
is just the first one yeah oh we're
getting pretty close yeah actually
really close we were gonna go into the
table if we went another half turn how
straight did we go actually not bad oh
why are you doing that so again yeah
number two Tom Petty was wrong the
starting is the hardest part can I take
this off now oh yeah see this sides much
worse but we can probably work with that
right yeah
should be fine flip it over we need some
fluid go straight really definitely not
trying it wow I just poked myself in the
hand why don't you just ask for better
tools instead of just making me use
crappy ones I don't think you need
okay let's put it on the table okay like
every every half Turner so go back and
break that chip that's probably good all
right times three more no that was a
good idea lubing it I take back what I
said before look at that it's like a
threaded hole and everything up in this
biz like trying to make this with an
angle grinder would have been a much
more interesting video or the sawzall
wasn't that like your entire like second
day of work like Freud you think
everyone got so annoyed it was so loud
outside so now we have to do what's kind
of the make or break for this so we've
got this over in here it's um a pinch
yep oh my god it's like natto continuous
piece no in fact didn't Jake show both
of us a site where you can just order
any o-ring you want it any size you want
why the hell did we do this because for
a lot of the custom stuff we're gonna
have to do later for like the red thing
crap we're going to have to be able to
make our own o-rings this is like way
smaller than the groove that is not a
tight fit oh it's it's not supposed to
be a tight fit just let's just think
about this one for a second yeah you
mush it down a bit but not that much oh
this is the actual specification we have
the Parker oring handbook you go in
there and you're like Parker oh yes it's
like the Bible for like opening
engineer's and stuff like so what are we
gonna do like they get the you know the
fair where they take the special glue
and they stick the two pieces of rope
together and the like oh look one piece
of rope it's cyanoacrylate it's amazing
yep really yep I'm so unhappy right now
that's really what we're using oh my god
that's actually what we're doing yep
what it really it's cyanoacrylate I hate
you all right here's your mark smart guy
please don't slice my hand is this
really a recommended way to do this you
know what let's just see what happens
okay you ever gotten the stuff on your
hands before yes I have
please don't that's a really bad time
yeah I know please don't
yeah that's good that's good less is
more but less is less but less is good
is what I was trying to say oh wow it's
not that close pretty bad well in
fairness to me I think the whole thing
is a little short anyway so we might as
well just put it in there and see what
happens
Oh actually no it's probably fine okay
so I can just put it together no no no
we need some petroleum do this this
makes another appearance we need to get
rid of this garbage this is a source
petroleum jelly I've ever encountered
you're responsible for this oh we got a
grease up our overhang yeah okay it's
disgusting it's like chunky I like my
petroleum jelly like I like my peanut
butter smooth okay so that's it which
which screws are we using those ones oh
it's the wrong way oh it matters no no I
know I did that on purpose but there's
no way the o-rings for the fittings are
gonna seal on the other side when I took
those chunks oh yeah so weird we're just
gambling here I mean theoretically
there's nothing like really climactic
what's happening right now please catch
we're good okay
give me with another one too so that's
it
moment of truth yeah find out if it
leaks dot in the center and then little
dots on either corner all right so yeah
I know why would we why would we drain
the loop all we have to do we're gonna
open up a side here and we're above the
water level in the reservoir so what
should happen cuz we should start to
draw an air this open that's all totally
open so as long as we don't lift this up
too high see how the water level rises
there we go
then we can have the tops of our tubes
drained this is it moment of truth
ah there's only bit wait who even thread
this correctly maybe we have to go from
the other side we didn't tap it down
from the other side oh that's gonna suck
alright let's put it on the other way
we'll do it the way you want this did
actually come together pretty smoothly
we're not done yet
we can't be too happy at this moment oh
this gives us a better look at the ring
actually so you can see where we mushed
it together there that might not leak so
you were right the direction you thread
it definitely matters either that or we
didn't go through enough yeah we could
just zip tie it good just not no no no
no this is a very well worn okay you
know what yes we can just not just a
second okay this one goes on we can use
this one oh yeah that's also a good plan
yeah that was the problem with these
fittings so what's gonna happen now is
I'm gonna move this down here and it's
gonna fill with water you can actually
see some water in it oh no it's
completely full of water now okay and
then we can seal up the top of our
reservoir here where'd that fitting go I
feel so bad for the people out there
that like know what they're doing it
must be like watching monkeys like just
when I hit this button we're gonna find
out if it leaks or not seems to be fine
now it could take a while for us to find
out if it's gonna leak but yes it
actually does seem to be fine how about
that just can't stop looking at it
just like so sure it's gonna leak why
well you saw that o-ring yes look at it
right now do you not trust Parker I mean
is this like is this like restaurants
like working at a restaurant where as
soon as you do that you'd never eat the
food like as soon as you like make
anything you've just like net like you'd
never drive in a car again like knowing
what the tolerances are like well cars
are pretty good it's airplanes that
really scare me their safety factor is
like under 10 percent like normally on a
car you do at least 50 and they're just
like nope any extra weights a bad thing
so now what we just give her alright so
well let's let's for say what we need to
be about it's gonna take a while before
we're gonna know so we should probably
give her okay sure all right
we're giving her boom all right so here
comes the heat max of 82 degrees to beat
the aliexpress and that's this one that
we think is even more cheaply
constructed than ours so correct netk
is 64 so we're already up to 78 so oh
wow really well on the hottest court on
the hardest core yes
oh also we never machined the bottom
which they did yeah have you seen what
Swift tech does with their skeeved thing
or basically it like slices into the
metal and then folds up a slice no yeah
it's amazing
can we get one of those machines nope no
close all the tabs done and we're at 83
degrees damn it
84 actually it settled back into 81 I
wonder if that was just for me like like
pushing on it I mean obviously you can't
design a product to have the user just
like hold it down well but we can just
tighten these a bit more Hey victory 80
degrees yay we beat Aliexpress for a
higher cost so there are some other
factors to consider here too like
whether or not our base was made convex
oops
or concave by the mounting pressure of
putting the top down on our O ring that
might be part of the reason why these
guys went with this plastic plate like
we actually don't know why they went
with an acrylic plate oh wow they didn't
even take the fricking who leaves like
the paper on a finished good that they
ship to the customer so what was what
was this ones a result or did we not
test that one we didn't test this one
okay we just did the ek I mean it
doesn't really matter we got our asses
kicked by everything yeah but but
the really positive takeaway here is
that it really is not leaking so what
that means for our future projects is
that given that we're not going to be
trying to cool a 78 20x freaking 8 core
CPU yeah we're gonna be like we're in
good shape yeah we can make water blocks
to fit on anything now they won't be the
best water blocks no they won't I really
want to do the network switch yeah
never assume network switch next and
then a challenge next look we only need
to be this sucks look at it it's
terrible it's terrible okay I'm feeling
good yeah LG's hashtag scale-up contest
goes along with the launch of the new LG
gram 17 laptop which we will actually
have a full review of coming out soon
and you can win it three different ways
method one watch a YouTube video and
answer questions by leaving a comment

thanks for watching guys if you disliked
this video you can hit that button I
guess but if you liked it hit like get
subscribed or maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the link in the video description no
lie we're gonna list this block on eBay
it can be yours for the low price of
whatever people bid for I'm just kidding
don't worry we're not shipping this to
anyone
yeah I also linked in the video
description is our merch store which has
cool shirts like this one these are
actually really nice look at look at the
quality of the printing we're doing a
much better job of merch now so you
should definitely check that out and oh
yeah our community forums which you
should totally join this is going to be
a royal pain in the ass yeah so did I
tell you I want to put it back together
first because we never actually like did
tests on the thermals</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
