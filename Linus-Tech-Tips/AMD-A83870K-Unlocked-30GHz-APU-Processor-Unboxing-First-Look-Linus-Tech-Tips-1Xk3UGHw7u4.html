this is an AMD a8 CPU and what's
different about this versus an AMD a8
CPU that I looked at before that I'm
actually gonna go get the Box on in fact
I've got a bunch of AMD boxes I was paid
and I should be doing that there you go
so there's the 83815 there's the fx-8150
so this is a 38-7 TK so what is the
difference between a 38-7 TK and the
3850 which I'm pretty sure this is a 38
50 please tell me it's 38 50 yeah okay
it's a 38 50 um the difference between
this is a you have a higher stock
frequency so this guy's clocked at 3
gigahertz versus 2.9 gigahertz on its
predecessor you also get a sticker which
I believe was also included with the
previous generation product it's got a
three year warranty which is typical of
AMD products comes with a little manual
for installing it this is an FM
Woonsocket product so that means it is
an APU just like its predecessor they
both are but the key difference
there's your included heatsink the key
difference is this right here the K and
the part number so the K in the part
number means that in addition to 3
gigahertz quad-core processors that is
CPUs so to speak 4 Meg's of total cache
ah I hope this is a 65 50 d I believe
it's a 65 50 D I'll be back so yes it
does have a 65 50 D GPU so really those
terms are what AMD would consider to be
obsolete because this is not a CPU or
GPU it is an APU which means it has a
quad core processing component as well
as a DirectX 11 graphics core and it's
all built on to this chip that goes into
the socket of your motherboard so your
motherboard is at the point now where it
contains almost no logic at all other
than your storage controller you know
USB that kind of stuff and almost
everything is done right on the CPU
including integrated graphics so
right in addition to all that you get K
which means it is unlocked this is
unlocked just like an FX class part just
like an Intel K class part that means
you can overclock more easily than you
could with the 3850 so in terms of your
sheer speed you know just out of the box
these are going to be very very similar
however once you start overclocking this
starts to make sense now how does it
compare to the competition
intel has their core i3 dual-core
processors they do have hyper threading
in some cases and honestly in some
applications where you need faster but
fewer cores it doesn't stand up that
well however if you are going to need
the extra cores or if you're going to
need the graphics power and you can see
they got like all these pictures and
stuff like dirt3 if you're going to need
the graphics power AMD's apu absolutely
smokes an Intel Sandy Bridge processor
with its integrated HD 2000 or HD 3000
graphics in games I've actually done a
video about this where I had the 38 50
and I compared it directly against I
think it's the 2105 from Intel that's
elsewhere on my line is tech tips
channel if you google like APU Linus
tech tips or something it should come up
and so you can see how drastic the
difference is between these guys and the
Intel competition so basically what this
is is it's an unlocked little bit faster
easier to overclock perfect CP apu for
gamers on a budget</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
