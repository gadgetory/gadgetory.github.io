- 7 9 q is it a worthy successor to the
PG - 7 8 q the monitor that I declared
to be the best gaming monitor yet let's
find out
the mastercase 5 by Coolermaster gives
you the freedom to truly make your
mid-tower pc case your own with a
variety of modular parts and accessories
check out the link in the video
description to learn more so for those
of you who have got other to do I'm
going to cut to the chase a little bit
here the swift PG - 7 9 q is even better
than its predecessor in almost every
conceivable way with the only trade off
being marginally slower pixel response
times due to its use of an IPS or
specifically aged VA but I'll use the
broader term for the rest of this video
panel instead of the TN panel in the 278
model so if you want the best of the
best
sixteen by nine 1440p display look no
further but for the folks who think that
TL DR just isn't enough to go on to make
an informed buying decision and the ones
that watch our videos to drool over the
tech porn as much as anything else let's
get into what makes the swift PG - 7 9 q
special and where it falls in the rest
of the competitive landscape first the
physical tour if you've seen the
previous rog swift you've pretty much
seen this one sex or ethically slim
bezels with even the logo adorned chin
bar being skinnier than the side and top
bezels of the monitors of days past a
sturdy and flexible standard design that
allows tilt swivel pivot and height
adjust an intuitive menu system with a
handful of quick access buttons and a
joystick for the meat and potatoes of
the OSD options seriously I cannot
emphasize enough how much of a relief
this was coming from the abominable
on-screen controls of the Acer predator
X 34 and an aesthetic that with the
optional red ring and ROG logo lighting
effects enabled looks sufficiently gay
Murray without being a complete eyesore
if your gaming rig happens to also be in
the middle of your living room so yeah
they didn't change much about the
exterior but why would they I already
loved everything about the predecessor
from the outside with my one complaint
being the while very good considering
it's a TN panel the TN panel that just
couldn't deliver the color performance
and viewing angles of an IPS display and
that's where the PG 2 7 9s upgraded guts
are starting to
I'm in the 27-inch 1440p panel has been
changed out to IPS and on top of that
the 144 hertz maximum refresh rate that
made the original Swift such an amazing
gaming display assuming you had the kind
of hardware horses to push that kind of
framerate in your games has been
upgraded and through a setting in the on
screen menu can be pushed even further
so with Nvidia g-sync variable refresh
rate technology you can run your display
at anywhere from 30 to 165 Hertz
depending on the frame rate that your
game is being output at and that's not
the only thing that comes with the newer
g-sync implementation now to accompany
the DisplayPort 1.2 port there's a
secondary HTMI 1.4 port if you have a
game console or a laptop or some other
device that you want to be able to
switch to on the fly because even though
these other devices might not be capable
of outputting games at higher than 1080p
60 Hertz there are benefits to using a
high performance display backlight bleed
was a non-issue on my sample the
measured total display leg with my Leo
Bodnar tester was 12.5 milliseconds on
the 60 Hertz HDMI input a very fine
result the motion blur or ghosting in
the normal default overdrive setting was
the best I've ever seen on an IPS
display with moving images especially at
the high refresh rates like 144 and 165
Hertz almost being eerily clear and
thanks to the IPS panel color
reproduction was nothing short of
awesome with a stellar contrast ratio
and color accuracy across the board
coming in below a Delta II of 5 with
both gamma and white point being within
acceptable margins right out of the box
with no adjustments made other than to
overclock the panel to 165 Hertz before
running my tests flippin awesome but
something to consider is that getting
the panel overclocked to that level
isn't a guarantee first of all you will
need to abandon all hope of running
ultra-low motion blur backlight strobing
since that only operates at 120 Hertz or
lower with g-sync disabled second you
will need a GTX 960 or newer Mac's
architecture card from nvidia with
owners of older Nvidia and AMD graphics
cards for the most part limited to 144
Hertz and finally while I can't comment
on whether this will be an issue for
this monitor because I only have one of
them mine worked fine and they don't
seem to be available to the public at
the time of recording this video it was
pointed out to me that some users are
not getting the full advertised 100
Hertz overclock on their Acer X 30 for
predator displays so there might be some
variability there which I guess raises
the question does it actually matter
anyway from my experience no not really
I mean overclocking the X 30 for
predator from 60 to 100 Hertz takes it
from just an ultra wide with g-sync to
the kind of thing that dreams are made
of overclocking the PG 2 7 9 q takes it
from wicked amazing fast to wicked
amazing
slightly faster if you are playing easy
to drive games like Team Fortress 2 or
csgo
at 165 freaking FPS or if you have some
kind of like liquid nitrogen cooled
space-age machine that can run newer
triple-a games at that kind of a
framerate while maintaining decent
settings because that is kind of the
point of a teasing display right
smoother animations even when the
framerate dips a little bit allowing you
to turn up I can deal i Clara Crofts
hair for a better gaming experience so
the last thing then to talk about is
price it's not cheap but honestly I
think he Sue's pretty much nailed the
positioning of this product it's about a
hundred and fifty dollars more than its
TN film predecessor but you get an IPS
panel slightly faster refresh rate and
an HDMI input it also costs about $100
more than the IPS panel equipped Acer xb
- 7 th you that we reviewed back here
but offers a faster refresh rate and an
HDMI input and also to my tastes a
superior aesthetic design so simply put
then it's expensive but for competitive
gamers who don't care about ultra wide
note that I'm not one of them and I
prefer the predator X 34 is curvy
sexiness if not its price it's the best
gaming monitor
ever this is the kind of gear especially
if you're coming from run-of-the-mill
60-hertz equipment that actually makes
it easier to track opponents and nail
