just admiring this new piece of
furniture I had cryo rig sent over I'm
not usually that big on monitor stance
but there's just something about this
one that really grabbed my attention you
know it's a nice size it stands up off
the desk with these trendy little wooden
feet and it even has USB but my favorite
part is actually what's inside
get yourself a cool t-shirt like this
one through our merch store with
designed by humans check out the link
below to learn more so young kids out
there did you ever wonder why we call
desktop PCs desktops well wonder no more
and feast your eyes on the taku a new
take on an old idea having your computer
lay flat on your desk by cryo rig ours
is actually a prototype that they packed
up and shipped to us after we saw it at
Computex the front of it is completely
understated all we have is the
relatively large blue illuminated power
button that also doubles as a drive
activity light on a flat white anodized
aluminum plate on the top and bottom of
the case our ventilation holes that work
with the slats on either side for some
extra breathing room on the right side
is our front i/o and that's it
it's a pretty basic layout so far around
back though it gets more interesting
there's a rear panel cutout dual slot
GPU mount and an SFX PSU mount but wait
a minute what's up with that hole on the
top left and right of the power supply
well look back at the front of the case
there are two slits cut out just above
the front plate with these you can run
USB cables through the back of the case
to your motherboards i/o making for a
significant reduction in desk clutter
for things like plugging in your phone
or USB headset neat literally it's legs
come in four varieties light and dark
oak and white and gunmetal anodized
aluminum and even if they aren't to your
style there's very little reason to
leave them out because like other
monitor stands stands the Taku is also a
great place to hide your keyboard when
you're not using it extra wide keyboards
like our g7 10 plus won't quite fit but
any standard 104 key or 10 keyless
keyboard will slide right in there no
problem and speaking of sliding the talk
whose best trick is what happens when
you
press in on the front panel in here
we've got space to mount the largest SF
XL power supplies graphics cards as long
as our gtx 1080i trays for up to two two
and a half inch drives with a 92
millimeter fan mounted on top and a tray
for a single three and a half inch drive
considering cases like the doctor's
neighbor sentry can pack up to eight two
and a half inch drives into a much
smaller ITX case this might seem a
little bit limited but cryo rig felt and
I actually agree that most people would
prefer better airflow for a few drives
to the ability to turn their small
form-factor case into a destination for
our backup of the entire internet build
time the slide-out tray is not nearly
long enough to access anything but the
drive bays but that's actually ok remove
the tray by pushing in these two black
plastic tabs from here each of the drive
bays comes out with a single screw and
you can install the rest of your
components run your cables through the
cable cover and oh wait a problem our
power supply actually didn't come with
cables long enough to reach cryo rig did
include extensions but there sinfully
ugly so we grabbed some cable mod cables
and mmm that's better but getting back
to practicality what about cooling
performance whether we're looking at a
synthetic CPU load a synthetic GPU load
or a combination of the two
our temperatures stayed completely
within reason these are excellent
results but that's kind of to be
expected for such a large ITX case what
that said though a case like this
doesn't really need to be super small
does it as monitor stands go this is
both a good width and a good height and
it's strong enough to handle pretty much
anything that you can throw on it here's
a shot of it with Dells 8k 32 inch
monitor
but don't imagine you'll be buying one
of these just yet cryo rig is still
working out some final details such as
tweaks support clearances whether to
have the included fan pull air in from
the top or bottom and where to add the
structural support that they need at the
front and don't imagine you'll
necessarily be buying one later either
the build quality is amazing it's
produced in Lee and Lee's factory the
layout should allow custom water cooling
with some creativity and we love cryo
rigs stylish and utilitarian new take on
the desktop PC but on Kickstarter right
now it's priced at anywhere from 300 to
almost 400 US dollars depending on the
options you select so yeah it's gorgeous
but priced more like trendy furniture
than a typical beige PC box tunnel there
makes it easy to browse privately and
enjoy a more open Internet it's
available for iOS Android PC Mac they've
even got a Chrome extension and it is so
easy to use you just press like the one
button and boom your connection is
secured and your online activity is kept
private from your internet provider
advertisers or anyone looking to track
you or profit from your data they've got
a top-rated privacy policy and they do
not log your activity and the best part
is you don't have to take my word for
any of this you can try it for free with
five hundred megabytes of data with no
credit card required then when you get a
year of unlimited data on tunnel bear
save 10% by going to tunnel bear comm /l
tt so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it was awesome get subscribed hit that
like button or check out the link to
where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also down there is
our merch store which has closed roads
like this one and our community forum
which you should totally join
the build quality is amazing and don't
imagine you'll necessarily be buying one
later the build quality is amazing don't
imagine you'll necessarily be buying one
late I think it's him right there yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
