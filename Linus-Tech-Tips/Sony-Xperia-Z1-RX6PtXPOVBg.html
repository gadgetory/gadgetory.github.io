win at a price you like click now to
learn more welcome to my unboxing and
overview of the Sony Xperia z1 let's
start with everything everyone else
already told you while we open up the
box it has a quad-core 2.2 gigahertz
Krait 400 Snapdragon processor with an
adrenal 330 GPU and 2 gigs of RAM
it comes with Android 4.2 which is a
little bit older now but there is a
planned 4.4 upgrade it comes with a
micro cable as well as a wall wart
charger some manuals and that's the end
of the unboxing portion it has wireless
AC bluetooth 4.0 NFC 16 gigs of on-board
storage with expandable microSD which is
definitely a plus with so many phones
not having that it has a good camera
it's a 21 megapixel camera but it
doesn't have necessarily the best
performance Sony does a lot of
processing on the images there's a lot
of sample shots out there you can go
check those out I didn't actually do any
and it has a 3000 milliamp hour battery
which is a very noticeable upgrade over
my daily driver which is the HTC One on
a light day and a normal day I could go
2 days and I can definitely make it
through a fairly heavy day usually I'd
have about a 40% charge left after a
normal day so that's that's awesome
because I'm used to having to recharge
the one every day no matter what now
I've been using the z1 for about two
weeks now but on poun first removing it
from the box my initial reaction was man
this thing's pretty heavy it's very
solid feeling with a glass front and
glass back so it actually reminds me of
the old iPhone 4 where it just it feels
like quality in the hand but I did find
it a little bit slippery and my wife
said the same thing all those slick
didn't have that problem at all with his
larger hands it should also be noted
that the haptic feedback is among the
best that I felt it's not overpowering
and you know many implementations feel
like the thing is gonna fall apart in
your hands that wasn't the case for this
phone so speaking of the screen in the
front of the phone there's not a whole
lot there there's a 2 megapixel 1080p
front camera for video chat there's a
speaker up at the very top with a
notification LED built into it the
speaker sounds great by the way but I
did find the
at the very top of the phone a little
bit awkward because I'm more used to
putting my ear right about here and
that's in the front buttons are actually
completely software and they are built
into the screen like many newer phones
on the right side of the phone we find
one of the cheapest SIM trays that I
have ever encountered in my life but the
great thing about it is that it does
happen to be to list so I guess that is
definitely a plus we've also got a side
lock button which I'm kind of
indifferent to normally I'm used to a
top lock button I didn't find this was
any better or worse and a volume rocker
that I see what they were trying to do
it has kind of a curved shape to it so
you should be able to feel where it is
but I found it was harder than I guess
they were going for to actually figure
out which one I was pressing so it was a
lot of trial and error there's also a
two stage camera button which is really
nice to have so you can launch the
camera anytime from anywhere and you can
prime it and then go just like you can
with many points two cameras also on
that side of the phone is a wrist wrap
anchor I really thought this was a nice
touch as well on the left side we've got
microSD expansion up to 64 gigs micro
USB yes these plastic covers are kind of
lame but I understand why they're there
more on that later and then finally
there is a charging connector for the
official Sony dock on the bottom we find
nothing but a speaker grille and on the
top we find nothing but a
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack so back to that screen with the
excellent haptic feedback it's 1080p
it's 10-point multi-touch as if you
could get ten fingers on there it's a
try aluminous LCD display with x-reality
engine and the first thing i did was
turn x-reality off because i was
watching and moving I was like this
looks terrible it seems to crank the
sharpness up to 200 and for some reason
I felt like colors looked worse too but
maybe that was just the color shift from
changing the angle of the phone it was
noticeable enough and off axis viewing
was bad enough that I did notice it day
to day but with that said you still have
very sharp text because it is still a
1080p LCD display and with x-reality
turned off video viewing was
satisfactory but it's definitely not as
good as something like the HTC One the
z1 is very fast but what isn't these
days I did find that animations like
expanding folders in the app tray felt a
little bit slow at first but I did get
you
to them in the overall experience is
very smooth the default sound scheme is
also soothing and natural especially
compared to Samsung's horrible one I
didn't feel the need to change it at all
the only issue I had with the setup for
that is that volume all the way down
silences the phone when you use the
button on the side versus HTC is
implementation where all the way down is
vibe and you actually have to very
intentionally go one up to get to silent
with that said you can hold it down and
go directly to vibe instead of silent so
it's just a matter of being used to it I
think for something like that the
default screen timeout was 30 seconds so
that is a thing that I changed right
away to a minute but this is just part
of their very aggressive power savings
that does turn into real-world battery
life improvements so I can't really
fault them there if their power savings
scheme also includes location-based
Wi-Fi and limited network connectivity
although you can whitelist certain apps
when the screen is powered off the best
thing about their power savings is that
just like their find your lost phone
feature it harasses you to turn it on I
love that because that's how you get
people to actually set things up while
the phone is great as a first phone
there were certain things that really
irked me about the setup process so
first of all is that account creation
for Sony Entertainment Network is a
little bit ridiculous it wants an eight
character password with no repetitions
of three of the same in a row mixture of
numbers and letters you know what screw
off because I can choose a passphrase as
25 characters long it doesn't have any
of that stuff and it's still a much
stronger password than something that
does adhere to that regulation so I'd
like to be able to choose my own
password I understand who is trying to
protect but I wish that it would give me
the option to just have something longer
there transfer wizard if you have an
existing Android phone is also quite
uncompetitive compared to HTC and
Motorola the ones that I've used which
are just wireless and you just install
an app this requires a PC or Mac to
complete it's a 25 megabyte application
that you have to download that then
wants to run in the background on the PC
you need to plug a cable into one phone
then the other it gives no progress
indicator and timed out both times that
I tried to use it I mean that felt like
a very 2010 experience to me the other
things that bugged me I guess for the
fact that it prompts me to like Sony on
facebook and follow them on Twitter the
first time I sign in I think Sony's a
little bit too grown-up for that but I
guess I thought all I had to say
negative
about the phone once I was done with
setup things got a lot smoother
something that I'm starting to really
like is soft buttons so I mean just this
is just an example but when you're
typing something and the keyboard opens
up it actually changes what the button
looks like to indicate the functionality
this might not be an issue for power
users but for someone like my mother
having the button actually indicate what
its gonna do so it's a little down arrow
to make the keyboard go away I think
that's fantastic and that's something
that hard buttons on the HTC One doesn't
really offer speaking of the keyboard I
didn't really like it the spacebar is
very small and combined with the long
travel distance between keys because of
the large screen I found it hard to be
accurate the great news about Android of
course is all I had to do was install
Swift key and I'm done
one thing I did like however is that the
backspace just speeds up individual
character deletion rather than starting
to eat whole words as you go back and I
did find it a lot easier to control
pictures in the messaging app are
actually kind of cool as well you can
like draw stuff which was a bit of a
neat experience the two times that I
tried it I sense like a couple of
messages but it seems like again the
kind of thing that you'd use twice and
then not worry about too much because
there are so many advanced messaging
applications like whatsapp and BBN and
all that kind of stuff that I think a
lot of people are gonna replace that
core functionality but again for people
like my mom it's great that they do have
a better messaging app than what I'm
used to seeing maybe it's the fact that
I come from iOS as my first smartphone
experience but and actually use the
desktops and widgets much I tend to
access almost everything from the app
tray and this was something that I
really liked swiping in from the left on
the app tray gives you access to the
Play Store as well as a variety of
different ways of sorting the apps that
makes it really easy to access your
most-used maybe it's a stupid thing but
I really enjoyed it they also have a
quick settings implementation that I
really liked you swipe down from the top
you can completely configure this it
arranges everything in a sensible manner
and it saved me the trouble of
installing power toggles really liked it
and compared to something like TouchWiz
it's not huge and like bright green
looking for whatever reason and compared
to sense it requires fewer clicks to get
at your most frequently used things
multitasking on the other hand wasn't a
great experience and I did find that
being only being able to see three apps
that were recently accessed on a 1080p
screen wasn't really out
quit I really like HTC's implementation
here with the nine most recently open
applications visible I did get teased on
my moto X review for doing a 5-second
summary of call quality so I would like
to talk about that a little bit guys
call quality is excellent and there are
no complaints I guess that was five
seconds again no but seriously the phone
app is well laid out and aside from when
you're dialing by by spelling the
person's name not sorting by the version
of that person because I've got some
people or I have four numbers for them
that you used most recently no
complaints here I did like at being able
to have access to my in call controls so
my mute and speakerphone and all that
stuff as well as my keypad sometimes but
then there was one more other thing that
bothered me a little bit and that was
when I'm in the middle of a call and I'm
dialing in
you know like options or pound or
whatever else it doesn't actually show
up so when you're dialing into something
like a conference call and you go oh I
entered the wrong passkey you can't
actually double check it alright so that
was a lot of stuff you just heard about
what I liked or didn't like based on the
experience of actually using it as my
daily driver but what's the verdict
Linus well it's not that simple you can
weigh the pros and cons and spec sheets
all day but the Xperia z1 has one trump
card and since my phone is a loaner
phone that I have to send back to Sony
I'll be finishing the rest of this shot
in the bathtub while watching YouTube
videos on my phone so we're gonna go
with the video that's actually by me
this is our build guide and we are
definitely definitely in a filled
bathtub here guys we got lots of water
we got lots of water and we are just
gonna drop that phone right in the water
you can no longer hear the sound
however the video playback is most
assuredly still running now one thing to
note is that the touch screen doesn't
operate very well underwater but I guess
that's pretty normal so I'm gonna go
ahead and tell it ya know it's okay that
the battery is low and we're gonna go
ahead and drop it back in so basically
guys who is this phone for we're gonna
hopefully overlay some underwater
footage from the phone of my hairy legs
here just to show you guys that it is
indeed working down there but who is it
for well it's for people who don't want
to worry about getting wet if you're an
outdoorsy person a party goer just
someone who wants to
record videos in Lorain then all the
other phones are kind of a non-factor
and you might as well just be only
shopping for an Xperia ray phone because
that's the only one that really comes
with that truly compelling feature like
this video if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it leave a comment if you
have any feedback on how we can make our
phone videos better and as all these
