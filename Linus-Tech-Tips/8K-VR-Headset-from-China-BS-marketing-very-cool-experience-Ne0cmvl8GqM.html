pretty new company based out of China
and they are making some very bold
claims so they boast that their VR
headset I've got a prototype of it right
here
delivers dramatically better field of
view and resolution compared to
competing solutions from big-name
companies like oculus and HTC and they
actually flew all the way out to my
studio here in Vancouver to have me try
it but my BS detector started going off
pretty hardcore when I realized that
they were calling the two 4k displays
one for each i8k that is at best a
little misleading but I mean I'm already
in at work on my Sunday due to some
scheduling challenges so what the hey
why don't we check it out my weekend
trip to the office by the way is brought
to you by tunnel bear the simple VPN
that makes it easy to privately and
securely browse a more open Internet
triangle bear for free at the link below
that's tunnel bear comm /l tt
well this bag broke okay I guess we
don't get another shot at this then so
right here in my hands I've got what
they're calling emphasis on their
calling cuz I don't necessarily agree
what they're calling the PI max eight K
the resolution that it's running at here
is 3840 by 2160 per eye so in order to
achieve that well they had to put some
pretty different hardware in here
although there's really not much point
showing it to you because the finished
version of the pi max 8k is actually
going to have one USB 3
this one has a USB 3 and a USB 2 and
it's gonna have a single DisplayPort 1.4
this guy's using dual HDMIs and then
because we're using a laptop for the
demo an hdmi 2 mini DisplayPort adapter
to drive the displays while the displays
themselves run at 3840 by 2160 the way
that we're actually driving this is with
two 2560 by 1440 signals that are being
up scaled if you want to run them at
native resolution you are actually gonna
need a higher end product called the PI
max 8k X and you're gonna need a pretty
banging computer because running two
displays at 4k is not exactly
straightforward especially if you factor
in that they Qatar run at 90 Hertz if
you want the kind of fluidity that well
you're gonna want if you are playing
games in VR now size-wise this thing is
really big it's like kinda chunky
looking but the good news is that when
you're gaming in VR you're obviously not
looking at yourself so all that really
means is that you're your wife or your
boyfriend or whoever's watching you play
the yard gets to watch you look like
even more of an idiot but weight-wise
it's actually not bad you still got that
tether drag but the distribution of
weight is actually pretty solid I got to
give them credit for that
now tracking is handled with these laser
trackers along the outside right now
they don't look like anything special
but this is pretty early going and this
is pretty cool so they're gonna ship
they have a complete kit that ships with
lighthouses but if you already have an
HTC vive you can actually use your
existing HTC lighthouses and just plug
in play and then that's also true of any
vive controllers so those are inter
compatible with a PI Max headset whether
you go with the 8 K the 8 K X or the
lower-end 5k now that's not to say that
they don't strive to build their own
controller so this is actually a
prototype version of their controller it
seems to bear a lot of resemblance to
the HTC controller but check this out
somebody dropped it at an earlier demo
this whole thing has been fairly well
used so hey
inter compatibility is still pretty cool
the the rep was able to run to the store
buy a couple of these and then bring
them over here for the demo so
experience wise because it uses the
lighthouses you can do a seated VR
experience or you can do a room scale VR
experience the maximum distance is of
about the same as the vibe so you can do
a play area about well this big I think
it's a 5 meter distance between the two
lighthouses truthfully I can't say I'm
too disappointed that I'm going to be
using vibe controllers today this is a
prototype but they've got a lot of work
to do here so this touch pad has to be
matte there's no way that they can ship
it with a glossy surface like this and
the tactility of the buttons i'll give
them credit it's lighter than the vibe
controller so that's good but the
tactile feel the buttons has a long way
to go especially this trigger down here
so hopefully these are all things they
can get resolved one bonus though is a
Type C charging so that's good this is
what they're planning to ship but I
would consider this to be kind of the
base model because part of their whole
concept is having a modular design for
this product so you could add like a
scent module you could add
support for prescription built-in lenses
you could add fricken what else they got
they're claiming that they can do
wireless transmission though they sure
as heck won't be doing that at full
resolution there's there's a cooling fan
module planned apparently that would be
pretty trippy oh and there it is it is
it's running no they weren't kidding
about the field of view it's all the way
from about I mean I can't see what I'm
doing but from about here to about here
and then from like here to here and
we've got another hilariously yes this
thing is definitely a prototype in case
you were wondering revelation here the
controllers are not running wirelessly
yet that will happen this is only
prototype 2 I think out of like I think
they're gonna do they're planning for
prototypes at least before they actually
deliver this thing feel like frickin you
know I don't know I don't watch movies
so I have a hard time doing like movie
references ok yes I know I'm mirroring
the display I'm gonna try and get away
with it steam VR give me a break here ok
so man this is gonna be hard to to not
walk too far ok I think I need to adjust
my interpupillary distance here because
this is clearly not correct
it's clear that they have some work to
do with respect to making the flat
displays appear a little bit more
natural as you move your head around so
right now there's a little bit of
waviness as you look from one side to
another there's a little bit of
distortion and it is a little bit motion
sickness inducing but clearly they're
not done yet and I will say text is
incredibly readable compared to anything
that I have tried before all right so
let's let's fire up a game shall we
why don't we do my first VR game space
pirate trainer so this is what I
initially set up my first time trying VR
in my in my computer room upstairs the
night before I had to bring the HTC vive
back to the office for loop to do his
review this was the game that I played
when I set it up in my office upstairs
so that's not oh wow I've never seen
this interview before what the heck so
what it's like armoured until it's like
okay oh come on
now no I just want the high score on
this setup here so that everybody who
ever does this demo can know that I was
better than that
all right so I'm dead so initial
impressions I'm gonna try it again in a
minute without that secondary screen
running because I know that that can
affect performance but what I will say
right now is that they have got some
they have some motion tracking
responsiveness stuff to address because
as someone who can comfortably play VR
for over an hour in games like hollow
point running around jumping I've been
in for about five minutes so far and I'm
already feeling nauseated they're saying
that they're planning to ship units
early next year I don't think they're
gonna hit that target and if they don't
hit that target I don't necessarily
think that's a bad thing
because I would rather that they spend a
little bit more time on that with that
said they're moving in the right
direction in some ways the increased
field of view and the increased pixel
density makes for a very different
experience I was pretty skeptical about
2560 by 1440 upscaled to 4k and for text
I don't know what the people talking
about how you could use this at the
desktop we're talking about like it's
clearer but it's obviously up scaled so
for text I wouldn't recommend the non X
version or I just get the 5k and run
that at 5 K natively but in games there
is virtually no screen door effect so
they're using what they're calling a CL
PL display and I don't remember what the
CL P stands for but the L at the end is
liquid and they're saying that it's
competitive with OLED in terms of the
pixel response times so that the
smearing that you'll see in the image as
you move from side to side it is not and
I don't know I don't know why they would
say that it's a very it's a very strange
thing to say because it's common
knowledge that an OLED responds
instantly well the best you can do gray
to gray with an LCD is multiple
milliseconds with that said it is better
than I thought it would be but right now
it's hard for me to say how much of the
motion sickness is from that and how
much of it is from the actual motion
delay when I'm moving around or moving
my hands now they told me that they
haven't validated space pirate trainer
so the next game I'm gonna try is one
that I've spent a lot of time with and
one that they actually suggested and
that is the lab so here in longbow
definitely enjoying the increased
peripheral vision so like facing this
way looking at the gate I can clearly
see guys coming down the steps towards
the right approach also in a brightly
colored scene like this I'm not noticing
any difference in pixel response times
to nearly the same degree
that I did when I was in space pirate
trainer where everything that you're
looking at is brightly colored objects
on a black backdrop which is typically a
more difficult scenario so I think I've
narrowed down where most of the motion
sickness is coming from it seems to be
mostly to do with the slight distortion
effect of the display because ultimately
you're looking at a flat display through
a lens that is stretching it out into
your peripheral vision but it seems to
be coming from the way that the image
distorts as I move around particularly
when I look up and down now they tell me
that the next version is going to have
an updated lens so I'm hoping that they
can resolve everything that I'm
experiencing today but like anything
that you'd be backing on Kickstarter
based on an early prototype you can't
take for granted that anything will be
any better than it was when they were
initially pitching it I will say this
though again the field of view is
incredible like I actually feel like I'm
standing in a plaza instead of feeling
like I'm looking at a three-dimensional
plaza that's like through a pair of
binoculars in front of me and that
effect is really cool so impressions
wise guys remember this is based on a
pre-production unit so take it for what
it is right now they're asking for $4.99
for up IMAX bare-bones on their
Kickstarter campaign so by bare-bones I
mean it is just the headset and they
assume that you already own vibe
controllers and vive lighthouses that
you'll continue to use then if you want
the full package it's $800 for this one
with the whole kit or $1,000 for the PI
max 8 K X although that one has actually
sold out at this time right now
even though that is actually quite a bit
cheaper than the HTC vive the
rift at 400 bucks with sensors and with
touch controllers included is a more
seamless experience for sure with that
said now that I've experienced what a
next-gen resolution display is like in
VR I would have a very hard time
recommending that you buy a current gen
VR experience because the increased
immersion from the wider field of view
and the higher pixel density makes an
enormous difference and this was a
pretty cool experience even if I do feel
a little nauseated right now I wish them
the best of luck on the next couple of
iterations because I can see they're
headed towards something pretty cool
here and on the subject of being headed
towards something pretty cool whether
your device is a VR headset or a phone
or a computer I fix it can help you take
it from broken back to something cool
they've got thousands of guides for how
to take apart and repair your devices
and they've got their award-winning
lineup of tools who did they win awards
from you might ask well me because I
actually bought my first iFixit kit
before they ever reached out to us about
being a sponsor and I awarded it still
useful to this day four plus years later
it's freaking awesome and the new one
their pro tect toolkit is only 60 bucks
now with their 64 bit driver kit their
suction cups their pride tools pretty
much everything you need including ESD
safe tweezers and an ESD strap to fix
your devices so why pay someone to fix
your stuff for you when you can get all
the tools that you need for less than
you'd probably pay and then you're
equipped for any job moving forward so
head over to ifixit.com slash Linus and
go check it out the pro Tech tool kit 60
bucks go buy one you won't regret it
also it's like october/november by the
