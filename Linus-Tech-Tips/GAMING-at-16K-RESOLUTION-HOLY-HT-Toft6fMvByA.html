cliffhanger with some of you expressing
frustration that we left you with these
apparently whatever that means
anyway we never meant to lead you on but
between the desk the monitors and the
troubleshooting it was just way too much
for one video but we're back at it with
16k gaming and this episode will be the
last and it's going to work we hope
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description okay so here's
where we left off some of the monitors
are running correctly for K 60 Hertz
some of them are not working at all and
some of them are somewhere in between at
this god-awful 1024 by 768 resolution
with pillar boxes so troubleshooting we
reseated our graphics cards we double
checked the connections on our quadrille
sync card and finally it might be the
painstakingly cable managed 25 foot
generic DisplayPort cables I've got the
new ones freaking fantastic okay so
while Jake works on swapping the cables
out I want to get into a little bit more
detail about the 16 K experience we are
trying to create here we wanted to
upstage our last insane resolution
gaming setup in every possible way so we
reached out to Acer who graciously
provided 16 of their 4k Predator xbone
gaming displays we weren't able to make
use of all of their gaming features like
g-sync can our config but their IPS
panels are an absolute must for a
monitor array that's so large that in
regular use
you could actually be looking at it from
30 to 50 degrees off-center let's move
around to where Jake's working and take
a closer look at the cabling even with
some clever cable management using these
stealth power bars that we've got here
we needed four pounds of power cords and
we actually need to wall circuits in
order to run this monstrosity because
with a typical power consumption of
around 70 watts each
our monitors alone draw more than 1,100
watts from the wall and sending an image
to the monitors was no easy battle
either so our original setup had a
whopping 300 feet of DisplayPort cabling
all nicely managed into the desk save
for a little bit that's kind of hanging
out the back here takes shrinking that
down to 240 feet now basically a lot of
DisplayPort cabling and I think we've
got all the replacements in right yep
okay this isn't sixteen gamers one CPU
is it yes yeah wait are they all 4k look
again alright there it is sixteen K's of
soon to be gaming glory and this is
probably even more impressive than you
realize because remember 16 K is not
twice as much as 8k and 8k is not twice
as much as 4k we are talking about a 4x
increase in pixel count as we move up so
to put this thing in perspective look at
the 1080p full HD monitor that you're
probably watching this video on right
now 16 K is 64 times the total pixels
your 1080p monitor would be this big
that's it
now let's talk about how we're planning
to drive them we learned a lot from our
last crazy experiment when we were the
first to game at 8k on YouTube and there
were three problems we needed to solve
one
we were running a mere two graphics
cards last time with consumer amounts of
video memory that needed to be rectified
to Nvidia is consumer grade display
spanning NB surround is not very
flexible and free when you run a 3d
application across multiple cards there
can be a desync Rijn eyes jelly effect
when you move left and right that's
pretty nauseating thankfully guardian
angel Nvidia saved the day
supplying us with four of their Quadro
p5 thousands valued at a total of about
10,000 u.s. dollars I saw a lot of
comments on the last video y Quadros
Quadros aren't for gaming okay if you
went to Linus University you would know
that they game just fine and you'd also
know that they address a lot of those
problems for us each of our p5 thousands
has similar performance to a GTX 1080
but with a whopping 16 gigs of VRAM so
that it's 64 gigs total for all dim
pixels
since we're not running an SLI also
professional Quadro cards have a
different display combining utility
called mosaic that can scale to far more
displays than NB surround and finally to
address the jelly effect and keep this
entire wall of monitors in sync they
have this extra little connector to plug
into a Quadro sync to card and it works
hopefully like the last video you told
me it was gonna work and it works okay
now to be clear this feature is really
designed for Jumbotrons and large format
digital signage like a Time Square video
wall versus gaming but we appreciate
NVIDIA agreeing to let us showcase it
for that which is coming very very soon
now hey you can tell I'm going to be
gaming cuz I have a gaming chair oh ok
my leg is recovered and more importantly
we've got all the monitors arranged
correctly now so check this out each row
of monitors is running off of an
individual card so what we should see if
we wiggle something back and forth is we
should see some jelly in this line here
but because of the sync card it's
actually pretty darn clean ok also since
we're in here holy crap that's right my
friends 15000 360 by 8640
and we are gonna launch some freaking
games after we take a closer look at the
table so if you didn't see it in part 1
this custom version of I see tables desk
expands their normal design from 6 to 16
monitors but everything else about it is
actually this cool even if you just get
a regular one so the entirety of the
desk is customizable from the Bluetooth
controllable RGB lighting to the
swappable fascia panels which might I
mention come in a variety of colors the
tempered glass desk can also sport a
graphic under it just pretty 6 you can
show off your favorite game car or waifu
if that's your mojo and there's built-in
cable management for the integrated case
that they call the t-con this is some
desk PC
forms right here so are you ready to
launch a game yeah which we do first
first minecraft we're gonna do some
minecraft yeah you almost need a
separate desk so you can desk while your
desk or oh okay hold on I got this it's
like oh my goodness that's a lot of
pixels loading world Wow
holy actual balls I will confess to you
I have never played Minecraft do we have
a fraps counter this is probably what
like 800 by 600
so f11 so we were at 400 fps it's just
gone
click f3 I think you can see up there
there we go there we go
No so we're running at like 8 oh we saw
hits there we're running it like 40 to
50 frames per second at 16k 16k that's
like 5 billion pixels a second or
something like that no we can't see out
here and you see I'm just gonna hit give
afterburner yeah
no way good but every GPU is using
exactly the same amount of memory it
might be shared Jake yeah alright next
game let's do one that we haven't tried
yet right rise of the Tomb Raider go low
settings just so we like have some vram
possibilities there sure okay here we go
you ready oh ok game launched 3 FPS
remember start benchmark remember
there's more there's more to lag about a
game than just the framerate quick oh
yes holy crap like the game's not even
running in real time right now
like you notice how long that
yeah yeah I mean it looks great even
like up close
right cuz this is this is still 4k level
of detail on every screen right yeah I
think this is about one frame per second
Lara Croft is actually like your size
look at this this is actual size you
heard it here first this is video games
in real size maybe I didn't hold the
Escape key for long enough
oh wow yes and oh wow no holy balls I
gotta know what video memory I mean it
must have just been pinned yeah
oh they're purely limited by vram like
it was swapping out to system memory so
that's interesting that means so we were
at 65% so there was 30% more performance
in there we could've been running at one
point three frames per second look at
the power usage we only ever went up to
50 oh that's really interesting so this
is like frame frame frame frame frame
like frame system memory frame system
memory very interest rate well that's
just try half-life 2 then there we go I
mean this is running on this so oh damn
no way no oh look at these tidy options
we're at the right resolution go to
advance the bottom right now
hell yeah can we turn out like that it's
like way over here give me the mouse you
know no I can do it you can do it and
then once you get its our frame rate 100
now 70 no way that's totally playable -
- like insane Terry okay let's turn
vsync on does it not have built-in D
saying oh here it is a name
that actually fixed the Terry that's not
bad
Wow what do we got 40 how's the input
leg you know what a lot better than you
would think memory usage is only eight
gigs yeah so temps are getting up there
and powers getting up they're actually
not as much as I would have thought very
interesting all right so you can play
half-life 2 at 16k okay what else we got
shadow of Mordor this is a disaster
geographical coordinate the virtual
putting Billy Bob Thornton on your arm
is a disaster
I'm just looking for a let's just lunch
it oh there you go
Wow wicked this is not 16 the right
resolution though not even close yeah
this is like 1080 or something loading
and also it's completely crashed now
okay well this game just broke did it
manage to lock up the system no no okay
system's up all right so we're gonna try
one more game then 5500 oh my goodness
this is impossible to read Oh oh my God
look at the you I got your the mini maps
over here they took the mini map we've
got the settler over there how am I
supposed to choose okay choose
production for the might go on where is
it
oh hi pockets way up there I'm gonna
make a granary is it a monument I don't
know I can't read it
what framerate is this running out honey
20 FPS not bad you have afterburner open
not bad alright let's find out sieve 5
medium details 8k not bad 9 gigs
ha so there you have it guys once again
you saw it here first
16k gaming on the PC let's see you do
that on an Xbox so you do 4k on an Xbox
there are a hundred reasons for wanting
multiple computers at your desk maybe
you're a Mac person primarily but you
need a non virtualized Windows
environment for some reason synergy
solves the problem of having to have two
keyboards and two mice for two or more
separate computers you can share one set
of peripheral so you'll no longer get
confused and the whole thing is seamless
you just drag the mouse from one screen
to another we're talking PC Mac and even
Linux support they offer a basic and pro
option for synergy with a one-time
payment and features include advanced
stuff like clipboard sharing between
computers dragging and dropping files
between computers the ability to set up
hotkeys and more so use our link in the
video description to get 50% off synergy
