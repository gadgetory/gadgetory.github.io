unboxing this is slightly different from
the one that we saw before so there's
two versions of the pl something 400
there's the pls k 400 which has the one
with one part and the one with the four
port hub built in and there's also the
PL ek 400 which just has two 200
megabits per second powerline adapters
and neither of them has a four port
however Swint sure whatever you want to
call it it's more of a switch than a
happy
built in okay so what do what does
Linksys have to say for themselves
transfer speeds up to 200 megabit per
second it should be noted that most
powerline kits are not even whatever
they're rated at are not capable of
exceeding 200 megabits per second anyway
so Linksys is claimed is that their spec
is a very honest spec if nothing else
okay if even if it's not the best specs
plug-and-play easy setup I can attest to
that push button security which you
don't even have to use you just plug
them in and they go fast ethernet ports
I think by fasting in ten hundred which
by today's standards is not that fast
but neither is powerline when you
compare it with Gigabit Ethernet so it's
not really fair powerline is the
technology that if you don't already
know and you don't follow this channel
and you don't know how much I love power
lines it allows you to run networking
data through the copper wiring that
provides electricity to the various
parts of your home so you take this you
plug it into the wall preferably where
there's not lit and not here and then
you have an Ethernet cable that runs
either to your router or to some other
networking device whether it's a smart
TV down in your media center or whether
it's a computer that's in the attic and
is otherwise very inconvenient to access
with with straight networking cable
comes with everything you need including
two Ethernet cables which you plug into
there and then plug into the other thing
that you want so the networking happens
between these two actually this is the
best
raishin I can think of four powerline
because it basically works like this
these guys interpret the data that runs
along I can never remember it eight pins
here turns it into two pins here then
there's some copper wire in between and
this guy interprets it on the other side
for eight pins to be compatible with
pretty much any network adapter anywhere
attached to a device so there's the
button that enables the security
there's your Gigabit Ethernet or gigabit
10100 Ethernet port there's your power
indicator there's your network indicator
and there's your other more different
network indicator for the other more
different network that is running on
