processor as an i3 this is exciting but
that's not all it also comes with
hyper-threading that's right two cores
four threads one I 373 50k this launch
from Intel may be a bold response to the
looming threat that is AMD's rise in
release or maybe it's simply a follow up
to the pentium g 32:58 anniversary
edition an overclockable dual-core that
lacked hyper threading presenting some
pretty serious issues in some modern
games that wouldn't even launch unless
they detected four processor threads
like far cry 4 for example which does
work with this 73 50k so it's a category
killer then well maybe not the G 32 58
was $75 in the i3 73 50k is a hundred
and eighty dollars and hyper threads are
still not real cores which you can learn
more about up here but for now let's see
how worth it the first unlocked core i3
really is OK to start us off there's the
specs it's got 2 cores and 4 threads
like I mentioned earlier but it also has
4 megabytes of cache so it's exactly
half of a core i7 7700 K in every way
thus far but the story changes when you
look at clock speed a 7700 K boost to
4.5 gigahertz
7350 k drops that down but not by much
just to 4.2 gigahertz and that's also
not the whole story
if someone buys a K series i3 I fully
expect and hope that they plan to
overclock it that's the whole point so
anyways I got mine up to 5 gigahertz
easily with one point four volts but
with some tuning I'd expect that you'd
be able to drop that down to like 1.3 5
volts or maybe even lower I stress us at
it for a long time it was rock-solid
I'm not the only one either people are
getting 5 gigahertz on this chip all
over the internet it's an exciting time
to be an i3 like before though you'll
need an overclockable chipset so dead
series if you want to learn more about
the Z 270 motherboards be updated
onboard graphics and the finer details
of Intel's latest platform
check out this video up here but ok
enough of that let's talk about
performance this is not an easy answer I
put our 70 350 K on the bench along with
an asus rog z2 70 Maximus 9 code 16 gigs
of g.skill ddr4 ram a corsair h 100 GTX
v2 extreme and a Founders edition NVIDIA
GTX 1080 just to remove potential GPU
bottlenecks and games on the same setup
I also ran a core i5 7400 the 7400 it's
a true quad core with for total threads
that cost 182 dollars just two dollars
more than the 73 50k to do this we use
the 7700 K and adjusted hyper threading
settings and multiplier settings to get
pretty much equivalent performance it
works trust me and if you don't believe
it check out this video remember no K so
no overclocking it's not an option for
most people the first comparison that I
want to do between our 7400 and our 73
50k is Cinebench the 23 50k has a way
higher clock speed at 5 gigahertz versus
3.5 so it should crush in single core
performance and it did so all as well
except that it also crushed in
multi-threaded those speedy little hyper
threaded cores not only crushed in
Cinebench but also pull the victory in
our 7-zip test and our gimp image
editing through asus rog real bench
that's four to zero so far but before
you go out and spend your 182 dollars on
an i3 73 50k and two cans of pop there
is also video encoding to consider the
i-5 7400 did win the real bench encoding
test but not by much then there's gaming
ah man there is no difference but
we neither of these processors or the
top-of-the-line 7700 K when testing Deus
Ex mankind divided so I guess I can go
ahead and never test that when comparing
CPUs ever again
so anyways moving on in GTA 5 rise of
the Tomb Raider and ashes of the
singularity average performance was very
similar there were some differences in
minimums with the 73 50k falling behind
although it was a little inconsistent
and not that major either way so in
conclusion the Intel I 373 50k costs
more than we feel like it should but I
was also expecting it to not be that
great considering quad cores have been
considered the minimum for gaming for
quite some time now but it destroyed so
that's pretty cool other things to
consider could be DirectX 12 and Vulcan
but I don't expect those to have
performance impacts and actual games for
quite some time now and then there's
Rison if you're looking to upgrade your
rig anytime soon you should probably
wait for Rison let's all hope that's a
