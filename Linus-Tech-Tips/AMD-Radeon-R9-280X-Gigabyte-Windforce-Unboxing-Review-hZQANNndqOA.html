ready for anything
click now to learn more welcome to my
unboxing and performance review of the
Radeon r9 280x this particular one is
unfortunately not quite in a retail box
but you know it was close the outer box
art wasn't done and the accessory
package hasn't been finalized but this
is a windforce card from gigabyte I
actually quite liked their wind force
cooler I saw a great demo of it at
Computex where they were basically
taking synthetic heat loads and showing
against some of the competition just how
much heat this cooler can dissipate and
it is a metric but ton they have also
done a great job of the industrial
design of this particular wind force
card compared to ones I've seen in the
past with a nice sexy metal support
bracket right here that actually makes a
big difference to the overall look at
the card and is functional as well so
what a support bracket like this does is
when you install the card in your system
it's only affixed by a screw here and
the slot here that's about it so it's
typical to see a lot of flex well this
adds rigidity and makes it so that
doesn't happen as much so there's less
risk of it flexing and bowing and
breaking something so there's also a
back plate look at that like full metal
back plate that also doubles as a bit of
a heatsink for some of the vrm
components there on the other side you
can also see the way that they're cooler
is designed is to not necessarily just
direct airflow down at the card but you
see this pyramid shape right here that
directs air flow down through the fins
to a greater extent as well as away from
the card so this will throw some cooling
down here to the PCI Express slot as
well as up here away from the card now
overall the design of this card is such
that most of the air is going to be
exhausted inside your case so even
though there's a vent at the back you're
going to want to make sure you have
great case cooling it's got three large
heat pipes that go from one side all the
way to the other side of the card I hope
you guys can get a pretty good look at
that and there's a three main segments
of heatsink on here and three a 60
millimeter cooling fans speaking of fans
and cooling let's talk about some
things that have been updated on the
280x so number one is that power tune
has been upgraded to not only account
for GPU clock speed and voltage as well
as the overall power usage of the board
but also temperature now so that means
that having a better cooling
implementation on your card will result
in tangibly better performance just like
with NVIDIA GPU boost 2.0 technology it
also means that you can control things
like say oh I want my graphics card to
run it 80 degrees or 70 degrees and you
can make compromises depending on
whether you prefer more performance or
if you prefer lower temperatures and
more longevity for your graphics card
they've also updated the fan curve
profiles so that they're not just
straight fan curves anymore there's some
logic built into them now that makes it
so that the fans ramp up and down slower
because it's been shown it's been proven
that people notice noise but they
especially notice changes in noise so
making them more gradual will make it
less of onion sort of experience when
you're launching games are not doing
anything intensive speaking of not doing
anything intensive zero core technology
is implemented so that means the
graphics card can basically turn the GPU
off when it's not doing anything
allowing you to save power speaking of
power at the back of the board we've got
an eight pin PCI Express connector and a
6 pin PCI Express connector and also
speaking of power yeah with all those
connectors we're looking at about 250
watts of typical board power and it's of
course going to be more if you're
overclocking which has been simplified a
fair bit because there aren't many
sliders to adjust anymore because you're
going to often be power limited by the
board itself you're going to pretty much
turn up the dial in terms of your clock
speed and it'll go wherever it goes just
remember guys having a better cooler
does indeed help in this case now what
about the overall positioning of this
card it's about a $300 graphics card it
has three gigs of memory so that makes
it pretty much optimal for 2560 by 1440
gaming at high details and if you look
at some of the next-gen titles like
battlefield 4
they'll even recommend three gigs of
graphics memory so it's basically the
card to get for the maximum gaming
experience right absolutely right now
and in the near future whereas if you
up to something like in our 92 90 series
you might be future proofing a little
bit more although I hate using that
particular word true audio is not
included because this is basically a 79
70 gigahertz Edition and because it
wasn't implemented on that card at the
time then there's no way to really add
it to this one after the fact it does
have support however for AMD's mantle
api which leverages the technology that
now exists on desktop PCs with the GCN
architecture and also in xbox one ps4
and Wii U so the idea is to allow game
developers at AMD says deads have been
asking for this for ages to program more
directly to the card rather than going
through a bottleneck such as DirectX so
because they're going to be doing a lot
of this work on those consoles anyway
devs that implement mantle support for
their games could be looking at
significant performance improvements on
AMD hardware on the PC stay tuned for
more we don't know how this is going to
shake down but battlefield 4 is going to
be adding mantle support in December of
this year as of the latest updates let's
move along to the IO at the back AMD has
added support for AI Finity using two
DVI ports and an HDMI port however this
particular card doesn't implement two
DVI ports so you're still going to need
to use a display port adapter
however the cool thing is that
DisplayPort adapters you can now get
relatively inexpensive splitter so you
could actually run three displays off of
each of these no big deal which i think
is pretty darn cool
never settle still a thing so you're
going to be able to get games with your
cards guys I don't want to give too many
details about the bundle because at some
point this video will be old and that'll
be irrelevant but you can go ahead and
check it out there will be a pricing and
availability link in the video
description below and the raptor app is
a new co-branding exercise that is
designed to go with these cards it'll
actually automatically install with your
driver if you allow it to and you
install your graphics drivers and it
allows you to communicate with your
gamer friends across platforms open up
applications without closing your game
window it allows you to actually stream
on demand whenever you feel like it so
using services such as twitch.tv and it
gives you optimized settings for your
games based on data that it collects
from other gamers what kind of hardware
do they have what kind of settings are
they running at you can actually select
a slide
that goes a cable I want the best image
quality and I'm willing to sacrifice
performance or completely the opposite I
want maximum performance no matter what
so this is very similar to what NVIDIA
has done with the GeForce experience so
without further ado basically guys it's
a 79 70 gigahertz edition but if you
want to see the performance numbers
compared to the current competitive
landscape and handing it off to slick to
tell you all about it the charts on
screen are very general and just show
the cards that I have benchmarked so far
now one thing you to notice with this
card the r9 280x which you probably know
because you clicked on this video is
that it sits up there at the top with
the 780 now you can probably just ignore
the Semin 84 now because the 780 s
competition is TBD yet to be released
that's not the acronym of fir yet to be
released but don't worry about it it's
it's up there really really strong
against some of its higher priced
competition actually which is nice to
see benchmarking this card was really
nice
because as the benchmarks came out I was
excited every single time because they
were very strong for its price point it
was good to see if you're someone who's
looking for a new AMD card because you
want to say get battlefield 4 and you're
worried about performance of your
current rig this is something to pay
attention to it's quite strong and very
well lined up on the performance charts
and will be optimized even more in the
future if you liked this video like the
video if you dislike this video dislike
it bring it on that's ok and comment on
the video what do you think about this
new format with line of starting it me
ending it and all that kind of stuff and
if you like all of line is tech tips
