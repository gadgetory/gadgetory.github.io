unboxing of 800 CR TG 5.56 millimeter
blank M 200 m 27 link okay no we're not
actually unboxing bullets this is just
the case
that's something top-secret from Nvidia
arrived in so by the time I released
this video to you guys it won't really
be top secret anymore but here we go
dear valued editor we are excited to
announce our new GeForce GTX 590
equipped with a 1024 cuda cores which is
double what you find on the GTX 580 so
that's your first hint that this is a
dual GPU card and then advanced 384 bit
gddr5 memory interface with three gigs
of memory which once again is double how
much memory there is on the GTX 580 the
GTX 590 has the horsepower to drive
today's cutting edge DX 11 games across
three 3d displays which is another hint
that this is a dual GPU card because no
single GPU Nvidia card can drive three
displays at the same time and in here
you will find some interesting things ok
there is apparently a GTX 590 dog tag
that is hilarious
it is personalized line of sebastian
tech tips first vision alright alright
what else is in here
USB dog tag with art assets suitable for
print and web publication so why don't
we find that in there
USB ok so there's some packing materials
because based on the the outer shell of
this packaging it's pretty obvious that
indeed Nvidia didn't want to risk any
potential damage to their new crown
jewel the DC X 590 okay well I can't
find that so what I do have is this at
any rate and here is the 590 card itself
so this is obviously not a proper retail
box unboxing but it will serve its
purpose of giving me a chance to tell
you guys about the part itself and about
the overall layout of it about some of
the specs because even now I haven't
heard all of the final specs yet for
this card even though the physical card
itself has arrived so the first thing
we're going to do is I have a look at
the fan so you can see right here the
fan design they're using actually
reminds me of a back way back in the day
the 7800 GTX the sudden weight Nova said
no it was a 7900 GTX that used a center
fan like this didn't it Nick - no no the
GTX did too 7900 GTX yeah yeah no the
7950 DX - used that dual PCB weird thing
okay so the 7900 GTX used a center fan
like this with exhaust going both out
the back of the card as well as out the
front of the card although that was a
much much lower powered card back in the
day anyway there that's pretty much what
I'm trying to tell you guys there's a
fan here you can actually see the two
vapor chamber coolers on the GPUs
themselves so maybe if I move this can
you see in there pretty good yeah okay
so you can see the copper plate at the
bottom that is a vapor chamber and then
you can also see the aluminum fins on
top and if I turn it the other way you
should be able to see the one on the
other GPU so the 2gf 100 GPUs are
actually on @gf 110 sorry GF 100 was GTX
480 GF 110 is GTX 580 so the 2 GF 110
GPUs are on either side of this fan
all right and you can all know there's
also more you can see here you can also
see that there's kind of a Yuna sync
thing going on so there's some gaps
where presumably I guess that's room for
some air to flow under the unison but
you can also see there's little heat
sink little heat sink pieces here if I
spin this a little bit I know it's not
good but then you should be able to see
it a little better there's also little
pins on the heatsink that are obviously
for cooling under this fan so this card
does use a custom PCI Express a PCI
Express chip in order to get maximum
bandwidth to both of these GPUs and in
terms of memory let's see actually where
they've got that position so it looks
like okay here you can actually see some
of the memory here on the on the front
of that or on the by I guess at the
bottom the top the top of the PCB let's
call this the top and then there are
also cooling plates on the back where
presumably there's going to be more
memory on the back of the PCB okay on
the back we can also see an overflow of
vrm circuitry so this is a very high
power consumption card I can tell you
guys that right off the bat like any
dual GPU card a lot of engineering goes
into putting to high-end cards and
essentially what is a very similar form
factor to a single high-end Fermi based
card so let's go ahead and have a look
at what we've got for power here so
we've got 2 8 pins that are delivering
power to this board and moving along to
the other side of the top you can see we
do have an SLI bridge
so this GPU based on this is presumably
Quad SLI capable which means you can run
two of these four for total GPUs within
your system don't forget you can't run
more than that because it is a driver
limitation so that is pretty much how it
works on the back of the card we find
some pretty interesting display output
so we've actually got three DVI outputs
and what appears to be there's only only
one way to check for sure
I happened to have a mini display for ya
that appears to be a mini DisplayPort
output as well so you can see nvidia has
dedicated as much as possible of the
back pci bracket to exhaust and they've
left they've left space here but they've
also left space in the top of the card
much like they did with the GTX 580 for
some of that exhaust to come out now
moving around to the back of the card
you can see it's a much lower
restriction sort of area so all of the
airflow coming out of this fan so about
half of it is going to go to cool the
1gp about half of its going to go to the
pool the other is going to be blown out
the back of the card here so that's
something you're going to have to bear
in mind when you're cooling your system
with a video card like this in it is
that you're going to want to make sure
that instead of having okay let's say
here example let's say you're running
Quad SLI with GTX 590 s and you've got
air being blown out of the case which is
great out the top of the card which is
fine and then out this way well what
about your bottom GPU that's going to be
blowing towards your front intake fans
on your case so you might have to
rethink your airflow strategy and
potentially change it so that that front
fan is may be blowing out instead just
just change the way you you do your
airflow so that you're not fighting the
direction that this video card is
pushing heat rather pulling the heat
away from it to make sure that it's
getting ample cooling it runs off of a
standard PCI Express 2.0 16x interface
so that means that each DP you has from
the slot anyway at least 8 X worth of
bandwidth I would not recommend running
a card like this on anything lower than
a PCIe 16x interface for maximum
performance although that sounds like an
interesting thing to test down the road
find out exactly how much slot bandwidth
a dual GPU gf1 10 card requires as I
mentioned before it does have three gigs
of graphics memory and it is fully
compliant this I haven't mentioned yet
with all of them videos latest
technologies including cuda physx 3d
vision and video surround we've got
three displays out of one card here all
DVI so you don't need any adapters or
anything
to run off your DVI monitors as well as
3d vision surround so every one of these
DVI ports is fully capable of driving up
to 120 Hertz up to 1920 by 1080 actually
1920 by 1200 at 120 Hertz
although most displays are 1080p in the
23 to 24 inch range these days so thank
