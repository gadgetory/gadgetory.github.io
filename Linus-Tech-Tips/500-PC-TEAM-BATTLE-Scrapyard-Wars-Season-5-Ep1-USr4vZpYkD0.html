the competition is going to be hotter
than ever because luke and I are
traveling to sunny California to take on
yes we're going to be on a team for the
first time Paul from Paul's hardware and
Kyle from awesomesauce news network
bitch win
it's a team battle everyone gets 500
American US dollars to build the best
RGB gaming computer they can make sure
it's all there yeah you know him and go
oh yeah and it's brought to you by
iFixit and fresh look okay ready guys
three two one okay
two teams how to build the best gaming
rig they can for five hundred dollars
the rules are simple
you'll work within the set hours you buy
the parts you use and you can't use your
influence as a youtuber to get deal oh
and the best RGB computer gets a 10%
score bonus welcome to scrap York get
the money I think so yeah I guess okay
coconut where does everybody build but
you guys to be there we'll go there
we're there you guys are in the kitchen
okay all right we get the we came in a
bed house little bit I don't know they
apparently have a lot of confidence that
I think it's unjustified because these
guys are these guys are cruising for a
cruisin for a bruisin here we need
laptops that we don't know what the heck
is going on we don't remember that we
don't know anything around here right
and also that this isn't the real money
this is Paul and Kyle's money that we
have to give back to them it's kind of
hungry I'm like oh okay you can please
okay we have temporally water you know
what why are you getting all the water
like it's really hot here and we're
gonna pour water out so this is your
money
so tell me better okay how are you guys
giving money we'll have to go get the
real money from the hotel room where I
left it but it's okay I can just give
you some of this money and then you can
reenact tomorrow that's good season
well we left it on like the counter in
the bathroom and we didn't put the Do
Not Disturb on and it's like a thousand
dollars of actual money so I actually
don't know if I were going to go back to
the hotel room I think I'm just going to
roll the dice on the money on counter
because we've only got two and a half
days effectively we started so late
we've never worked together I don't even
know what to say to you I know I'm just
automatically looking things up yeah I'm
like I'm looking at Goodwill electronic
recycling right now okay okay so how
about I I start tracking down what's on
craig's do they have tgd here I don't
know about Khadijah here I don't really
think so because Kijiji is owned by EBA
and EBA is bigger in the state now you
were saying this earlier like they might
not know that Orange County is pretty
near nearby here so if we're lucky they
might end up hitting hitting up LA
Craigslist which is going to be a hella
trap is this Ontario Canada pre-gig
Toronto yeah no no dice yes I looking at
LA this is our home field advantage if
they are looking at LA traffic or if
they're looking at le locations they
might get all the way into LA which is
to the north but we're like right on the
border to your South Orange County I
think our initial role should be to try
to find a really cheap complete system
but somebody's telling that you can get
basically like a taste and a power
supply that we can get like dirt cheap
and then part I think sorry the
integration is going to be a challenge
but I feel like we might consider I
would have an ace-in-the-hole an option
which is my percentage to make sure we
ash we head out or just I just realize
that we can't leave them here though
because I hunt them up I have to lock
the door
I love how that we get the workshop it's
awesome
except they said it's gonna be really
hot and that has central air and this
doesn't oh so we we thought that they
were no I didn't oh did you clear into
the workshop so you knew that we were
getting on immediately yeah great you
were like let's we take the workshop it
was like oh crap
okay well I'm sorry
alright interrupt we just realize we all
need to leave together because I need to
lock the door otherwise it will be
unlocked and just whenever we go this
isn't Canada guy I know we log on our
door adorable people will kill us you
know second key yet you have a key like
I'm I realize I'm asking for a large
door work garage doors not really not
unfortunately
all right I have an idea but we'll
discuss when the cameras are off okay so
here it is strictly platonic here we go
wait what am i doing so la sucks what I
mean by this is there's like nothing
there in terms of you PC parts
everything's Mac books you know what I
think the first thing we have to do is
is get our bearings like maybe the
reason you can't find anything for
Ontario is that that's not like like a
relevant research thing yeah like like
where it's like Orange County and
there's like Hollywood and Hollywood
like now or with a lot I just mean so
these are like are these counties is El
Monte these are all really small okay
the Los Angeles is like a fair ways that
way I think I don't even know where
Hollywood is all I know is there's a big
sign that I've never seen even though
I've been to LA like quite a few times
these guys are leaving already
you guys are leaving already yes yeah I
mean you understand what happens in this
area with traffic after yet satellites
don't the amethyst
it's have to been not like it's going to
matter they will be traffic forever
I thought that fantasy you get it's true
okay bye well what are we gonna do I
hate you I have a feeling they're just
going to come oh that makes sense
those guys are so foolish you know what
I think that these guys actually if they
actually intend to get out there today
are going to be in for a rude surprise
in terms of like research matters yeah
how not efficient that is yeah maybe it
was kind of unfair and like sort of us
to sakta tunes like this little man then
again like I'm going to be killing my
signal tonight killing myself said
kicking myself at the very least for
saying something like that and
potentially we've been potentially
losing forgot somebody bribe the judges
what if we had food does it somehow
associated with the system that they can
eat and the food was colored red green
and blue like green eggs and ham
Pepa thing like on the our spot I don't
know maybe okay maybe I guess that color
crazy I just I'm trying to fall here
intentionally start out ideas we're
going to make like a you know a fast
food run right before we get to the
judges that in like maybe like put all
the food inside the case when they open
it up you know like dinner served make a
swim that should work out perfectly that
or paint I mean I mean if we can't if we
can't find anything that lights up RGB
maybe there's some things at your house
maybe there's some things that light up
at your house that aren't necessarily oh
I guess we couldn't use any day I never
have to buy everything buy everything
I'm going to call this place right now
okay hey Jared I was wondering if you
guys sell any like sort of pre-built
systems that are somewhat more fully
functional no sorry about that
alphabet alphabet wait you can just miss
your chance to meet me God all right
I don't know I thought I thought we
weren't allowed to go into the 909 oh
that's a dangerous area what's no it's
not is it nine I know there's nothing
crackhead that means that men will be
willing to sell computer points provide
really cheap okay I obviously go back
for quite a while we work together
Newegg we do regular regular weekly live
show on Tuesday evenings 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time and it's been good so far I
think we have a good basic understanding
of like you know working together and
everything so that's good we're pretty
used to each other's vibe and can really
feed on each other's ideas and things
like that we're really good at bouncing
back back and forth ideas so so far it's
been a pretty positive experience
whatever what's the rule is look like I
plead with crackheads if we bought some
crack or something at like a really good
rate crack let's say we knew a guy right
and then we could bring it out to that
area and perhaps we can trade up you
know and get more for they would all
just kind of come screwing I don't know
what the rules are a scrap yard works
for like an intermediary form of
currency or crabs Arabs or sometimes I
can be a little sporadic and
scatterbrained and he brings back to
focus but then I could sort of drive the
urgency so I think it's a nice balancing
angry hi I was wondering if you guys
sell any pre-built computer systems
okay I'm thinking this might be a good
area to kind of have as a base of
operations we're in Rowland Heights
right now Newegg is located just a few
blocks that way as well as quite a few
of the larger manufacturers of parts
like MSI's over there gigabytes over
there is Oh Tex over there there's a lot
of kind of techy people in that you know
might work would actually work with them
directly
not that we're like trying to find
anyone we know but I feel like I feel
like in this area with your final that's
a good idea
so I think maybe get some food and while
we're sitting down we can make some
calls via Craigslist or something like
that I think if we get I think if we get
food than we've already won really
that's probably true you can't can't hum
for computer parts on the empty stomach
from minute zero you have to bust or
else you're just going to fail I'm so
glad that we stopped here at least
sandwiches purveyors of fine Vietnamese
baguette based sandwiches and stuff to
eat and recoup and gather I thought I
agree also we're so overconfident I
think so fresh books of sponsorship is
that we use the fresh books app to track
all of our our expenses so we could do
time tracking but like we're not doing
anything we're doing but you basically
just go like this
and then you just like put what it is
and how much it was and the currency
will you do distress and then you attach
or see this take a fit picture all right
yeah I don't know why we were ever using
a spreadsheet for this before I'm sorry
I will get Excel open at some point here
and everything will be fine well I was
just wondering if you guys sell used
computer parts arts yeah maybe what are
you looking for
I generally know but what do you got
what you need um basically we're like
we're trying to build a pretty good
gaming system for a friend but we've
only got like a few hundred bucks so we
don't have a huge budget and we were
thinking maybe buying used to be a good
idea so my guess is you'd be interested
in when those machines parts well I know
what you're looking for specifically
meaning all we do is match versal oh
okay yeah I think I think we were
looking for Windows so thank you very
much then you look at PC parts on
Craigslist
it comes up with mac mag lock power
adapters it's all max max to the max
MacBook Air hi Mac MacBook Pro Apple Mac
Remote this is what I'm dealing with
here we should just build a Mac like
what are we expecting for five hundred
US dollars so someone wants four hundred
bucks for an r7 370 FX 83 28 gigs ram
one terabyte hard drive holy this is not
like as cheap as I was sort of hoping it
would be there is a 970 for 190 bucks
should we decide now like do we go for
the RGB modifier or do we forget about
it I think we don't focus on it oh they
still to start do you think they're
gonna go for it we could try and do it
creatively like we could buy like red
green and blue paint yeah I thought
about that but making that look
genuinely cool might be difficult maybe
not if we had enough time like it's hot
here so paint would dry really fat have
you ever done like cornering cornering
like use a few different emails
this whole number is too low ball super
hard and then like do a more reasonable
one she's not you have ever done that
I'm scrap yard or is that okay okay okay
should I get on creating a few Gmail's I
have a few okay so we're half an hour in
and I have got the scrapyard Wars Five
Dock open in my activated copy of word
that's where I'm at
I got honestly almost nothing done for
the first hour I was just wondering if
you guys sell used computer parts no
nothing like that we don't sell part hi
I was wondering if you guys have used
computer components for sale I mean you
could check around within the shackled
stance the garage you can check those
guys I really hope those guys are like
not finding anything right now because
there's not a lot of time I just found a
really good deal on Craigslist it was a
2500 K overclockable for ninety bucks in
Garden Grove but I kind of screwed up I
emailed them from my business email
they're like so he knows if he knows if
he recognizes me but in any way shape or
form that means we can't do the deal
technically we will subscribe your doors
so I'm really hoping that I notice
something doesn't recognize you then we
would just want to confirm yes we will
pay this much and we will come and get
it yeah and then it wouldn't matter
because we would have confirmed the
price beforehand right
okay so Inland Empire Norco actually we
have a I 520 500k based systems this is
a complete system for $450 of course
their memory looks like an 8 gig - seems
like to four gigs 667 motherboard a GTX
950 a graphics card so it's not that
great but at sea Sonics attended watt
power supply ocv 240 K SSB and even some
like LED red LED fans and stuff so
maybe maybe we could reply and ask him
if we could just omit the gtx 950 since
we don't need it as well as like there's
like bundling some other crappy gaming
peripherals mother for keyboard and
maybe if we could just eliminate those
and try to talk him down on price
because right now it's forward in 50
bucks which is most of our budget but if
we can cut that that down like 350 or
something they think ketchup and mustard
cables count as RGB oh okay
did you didn't leave your backpack did
you laptop no kind of careless idiot do
the game we need to do something today
that we need to we got to stop somewhere
you need to interact with other humans
it feels like we haven't done anything
like when we went to leave and ate
sandwiches which was delicious I don't
regret that in fact we could just go
back there again tomorrow I think oh my
god what if we just like went to a scrap
yard and like found some metal and like
dent it going we've got iFixit kids yeah
maybe word so what does the iFixit
protect toolkit have in it okay we've
got a 64-bit screwdriver kit is that is
that is that good for bending metal I
mean it'll help us like fix it together
no okay it's got their their prying
tools I'm thinking steel sheet steel no
not what that's for suction cup to
removing screens we've got we've got ESD
safe tweezers and ESD wrist strap so
this looks great for stabbing you for
terrible idea of your ID host have
yourself that was not my idea to bend
the middle
I thought I was gonna make it out of
wood okay well okay so the iFixit kid is
good for lots of things like making a
key sort of wood like making no it's not
good for making a case out of winter
together it's good for reasonable things
hi called up computer recycling team and
was recommended to you I'm looking to
buy some used computer component I have
a be quiet under one fully modular power
supply into a z9t XSL I take it by word
that living 50 socket I don't bring a
new that's it Minotaur we also have
gaming towers we have seen you coolers
power suppliers all that stuff don't
bring you've never been touched we're
pretty comfortable with DIY and and used
stuff like we would we don't have that
kind of a budget like I can already tell
that power supply is going to be like
half of what we would have to spend well
everything is 50% off whatever in home
prices okay um so you said you're going
to have some more use and do those
motherboards that you had to go through
tomorrow do those have CPUs and RAM in
them as well it could be dig through the
file
oh when we're actually all out of CDs
right at the moment when that stuff
comes in is gone within 10 hours best
understand wave um better graphics cards
we buy everything wholesale so we just
buy pallets of stuff then sometimes we
love you sometimes we don't but 90% of
the stuff that we're giving as far as
gaming stuff is all brand-new never been
opened some dough just just to get Texas
tomorrow morning and give you time oh
I'll be yours what I can be here great
yes thanks are cool what
50% or more off of ticket for Brendan
for like full sales stuff I guess it
makes sense because this is where all
like this is where basically all the
computer parts for North America come in
so I guess it's more likely like for
there to be a pallet of random
motherboards that like didn't sell or
whatever I don't know I don't know if
we're going to do very well with that
though to be honest because like if you
only has the motherboard like bundles
that's where you know I know I not lean
but I often find like like how many
scrapyard works have we had to buy a
power supply at the very end yeah almost
every time yeah and he's got a 50% off
power supply yeah but like even a big be
quiet 800 watt at 50% off is still like
$100 to spend like 40 bucks 30 bucks on
Carson yeah that's 4400 3 point 1
gigahertz um it has 4 gigs of ddr3 um I
think don't 50 ok we've seen you've seen
significantly better pricing on that
kind of era stuff so I might I might
have to pass on that one but I'll call
you back if our other leads fall through
them so thank you ok thanks did you say
asshole
absolutely ah well that's a lot nice
here anything to say yeah ok so there's
a full gaming PC $450 which is right up
there with our budget but it's almost
good to go it's got an FX 95 95 or 212
Evo an r9 390 which is a sapphire card
390 is still pretty solid 16 gigs of
ddr3 725 watt power supply this thing is
pretty much good to go
right out the gate especially because
it's got a fan Tex P 400 which is a
fairly new case it's a very recent case
that has RGB LEDs in it and 2 terabyte
hard drive the only thing that's missing
here is an SSD at least in the looks of
it so that would give us 50 bucks for an
SSD a if we're just putting the OS on it
probably don't need more than 60 gig SSD
which we should be able to find for that
price I'm emailing him right now the
only issue that he lives in Calabasas he
or she lives in Calabasas which is
probably an hour 15
I have one way out traffic we're not
having too much look with Craigslist so
far we've found some listings but we
haven't heard back from anyone we've
contacted yet so I have installed let go
which is an app that's just below you
take a picture of something and then
offer to people to trade stuff there
does seem to be a decent amount of stuff
on here I found this listing for three
computer towers just a case but the nine
bucks each and if we could not get a you
know the decent case that will fit
everything looks okay for nine dollars
then I'll feel like we accomplished
something today hi this message is for a
Jason I'm calling a boat oh can I start
this over
thank you goodbye
oh crap 984 175 mothers yes you come
over I don't mind how to get back up to
my rig running it to your benchmark I'm
off today any time let's go hey guys so
I realized we don't have an address yet
but what's OK ROCK gummies so we'll go
back to the hotel while we wait for him
to get back to us on the address I
finally feel like we have a purpose or
so yeah this is Lilia from Jay exponent
mu messages on eBay so you guys had some
Dion's listed correct yes
were they 5670 sorry I've messaged quite
a few people yeah for this X 5670 right
now we haven't looked for one can can
you do any better than that we're
looking for the pair or I did want a
pair of them because the board that we
were able to find it like we're kind of
scraping together bits and pieces here
the best I can do right now is 100 a
hundred for both yeah yeah like if we
can't build a system for 325 like then
we should probably just stop making
scrapyard worse because we clearly suck
shoot there's more than one of the exact
same address like one of those in
Fullerton one of them is in wit ta I
think there's actually more and so on
train boot that oh I'll check
I'll check that's in the dock right yeah
okay I'll check oh crap I think
Bakersfield is in a different place all
together
oh my god this is two hours away
I'll call fall can ask for mercy
yeah but if you were them would you give
us mercy I have before yeah but you're
you're soft and weak like that so we
wanted to know you know give them the
late start today you know what would be
the odds of doing like a longer a longer
pickup tonight you know people say
mistake mistake mistake and then we had
the main issue of the code and actually
he is probably in Pictou in about a half
an hour okay okay okay you know I'm
trying to talk him out of it he said no
you know you just said I don't care yeah
you were scrap your horse or anything
yeah you know I just I really thought
you guys were cool which well no he's
not he's nothing no to us interesting
that Kyla we're just wondering if we can
go try somewhere in that bag so
basically what you're saying is that
Kyle's being pretty and considerate then
I'm definitely passing the buck yet yeah
when I stretch rules append them out of
Schaefer go 18 hours overtime or
anything like that okay all right I can
respect that I can respect that I'm just
I'm just going to be thinking about how
much I respect that if you call me and
you need a tool or whatever you know
well well you know we're not vengeful
though so all right all right thanks
Oliver I've never known you to be okay
thanks all thanks Paul thanks thanks
thanks false
thanks for nothing Paul you
yeah so that Linus was asking if we
could extend tonight during a time
period when he knows you will not be
here that's BS I already told them that
I wouldn't be available after 5:30 extra
co6 so unless you want to go alone
but I don't know if Ed's I wouldn't say
appropriate especially because they
might get mugged oh yeah and I know that
your jujitsu skills are probably lucky
if you got mugged I don't like that
would traumatize me yeah you know look I
don't know if I can handle that you
getting mugged if we have to pay $100
for the cpu's we get the 24 gigs of ram
the dual socket board the 175 gtx 980
the $40.00 case if we can get the sse
for 35 with no tax and we can get the
hard drive for $10 then we are going to
be they're going to be $25 over we over
$25 over
I was testing them out and one of them
was defective Sunbird away okay so it's
been up to so it's two drives for ten
bucks
yeah you can have pretend buttons like
my uncle
okay I'm calling up Michael here let's
see if Michael is going to come down
from 250 to 175 on that there video card
if I can talk to him maybe I can reason
with it
I don't blame people who don't think
Michael must show up on the caller ID is
a terrible person
oh hi is this Michael oh hi I saw your
craigslist ads for an MSI GTX 980 yeah
yeah I'm interested but I I hate to be I
hate to be one of those people but I
only have a hundred and seventy five
bucks are you able to do that alright so
I got work right now I can leave five I
can come get it like tomorrow like quick
sale at least it has that going for it I
can put them in five starts
I have any more favorite one I'm a
little Ivy I only have 175 so unless you
wanted to do both of them for 175 it's
definitely just one flaw ridiculous
what's the best you can do for one the
best I suppose I can 24 them is what
sorry it's 220 180 2002 2000 K I
definitely miss heard you there yeah
okay thank you so much I just I don't
think that's in the cards for me right
now I really appreciate it though
actually Ashley excuse you what's that
sorry choo-choo was it 200 yeah I'm on a
you know what I should probably tell you
like sort of what's going on here
basically one of our buddies is moving
away doesn't have a gaming rig and
everybody scraped together 500 bucks
that's all we've got and so we're trying
to get kind of everything for that and
basically we pledgeted it out and we've
got 175 for the video card like that's
kind of where I'm at and I can maybe
stretch like another 10 bucks like could
you do 185 you know what I can do 8
months you can do 185 okay that is
incredibly incredibly cool of you I
think we can hold on I think we can make
this work if we can get an SSD for $35
and I get the CPUs from the other shops
where there's no tax
and we do and we do 16 gigs of ram
instead of 24 then we're at four hundred
ninety eight dollars and seventeen cents
maybe I should have negotiated all the
$2.15
so far we've got like what two bucks not
even quite ah yeah Julie I'll push
laughter adult so we've got about two
dollars you know I'm gonna do I can get
this guy if I can get this kind of 750
then we'll have four dollars and fifty
cents oh my god if we drive five hours
then we'll have $14.50 which is probably
enough to do something RGB we could
probably do something RGB for free like
if we just wanted to like the idiots and
like find red things and like leaves
fantastic own work to travel ooh okay
done deal pleasure doing business with
you thank you very much guys this is
have two drives in it it might hopefully
maybe it's like a raid thank is that
what's a dual interfaces therefore maybe
there's actually two drives
we'll have to see you know what's really
funny is iFixit sponsored this and we
actually have to disassemble hard drive
day 1 we have a thing well two things
with that our days sort of done I think
we got this yeah well it's six o'clock
exactly we're just out getting food yeah
I have to
let's food Bannon food be good yeah
we're not we're not doing chef here
doors anymore we're just sort of getting
some food don't worry but ok so let's uh
let's drive back to the restaurant that
we are at right now
okay okay so this is day two scrapyard
Wars day one Paul and I didn't really
get any parts no one's here from the
other team right they can't hear us okay
so we didn't get any parts yesterday so
all the emails that I sent out casting a
really wide net just being very polite
and trying to see if anyone would reply
I'm following up with all those people
now like my house is on fire and we're
all about to die because we only have
one more day of this tomorrow is pretty
much Judgment Day so pretty much we need
to start parting things together
hopefully by the end of tonight early
tomorrow morning so we're just gonna
have to see if people respond to a sense
of urgency
you can tell the town of my emails that
this is a matter of terrified I feel
like we've made some real connections on
a deep emotional human level with the
people that we're trying to negotiate
with that's important for getting the
best deals sorry but I'm trying to get
rid of the whole computer not interested
in partying out screw you Kyle has some
strategic he's working on right now
we'll see if that works out I'm not
really sure are you serious right now
yeah you're literally cleaning your car
it's important in day two of scrapyard
Wars we need to be able to see clearly
out the windows to the computer hardware
that's up that you should not have with
Windex in your hand offices for a side
panel window damn it alright first stop
for today is Fullerton California lovely
town that was in 1898 get to the point
hahaha there's a guy there with cases he
has I think he has four of them some of
them have some parts built in them given
that he got four and he looks like nine
bucks for them and it sounds like you
might even just basically take these it
might be just kind of a good stepping
off point get something in hand very
minimal investments and we're really
hoping there might be a power supply and
one of them is usable too
in other news I just got a reply from
the dude that has CPU and motherboard
that's Casey I can't even remember I
probably 2600 K it's all aboard right
now but it's a good CPU and motherboard
and this is a guy who didn't want to
meet us at lunch because on his one his
lunch break from work because he said it
was going to take too long to
disassemble the system I told him that
I'm a full time system builder and I
could provide any assistance if possible
and he said that won't speed things up I
just need to unscrew everything
including my specialty mounted liquid
cooler from the board can you text me at
this number so we got a number from him
okay that's good faster communication
yeah he said that would be faster I
might be able to work something out I'm
okay with you we're okay you know me I
mean I've got so much stuff listed on
Craigslist I have so much stuff listed
on let go and I'll offer up that
afterwards I'll block the price just
this guy clear it out yeah are each of
these ten bucks or what so the pricing
on the working one how about 30 okay 534
this 1010 that one five do you know
what's inside of that other really it's
next week however where else else
there's a modem in there got here look
guys so it's also potentially a
proprietary power supply so the power
supply will not work for it yeah it's a
proprietary so the magic wouldn't have
this where we're trying to part out an
entire system as quickly and as
inexpensively as possible right this
bait is the basic game so the hard drive
I do appreciate you contacted me I drew
preciate you following up of course I
like people like that because it drops
the price and get rid of all their yeah
my wife can be happy I can be happy you
can be happy this is an HDX chassis it
can work it's got a window
so technically being able to put some
RGB lighting it and was shine through
and nothing else is really usable the
hard drives only 40 gig and it looks
like we don't have the correct and there
anything on that motherboard well the
motherboards are super outdated I don't
even know what
but down why we're agents good know this
could work
how much you say for this one again like
I know okay very strange what's your
happen guys I get it all this on dad
jacket back at the garage I feel you
yeah this was never wind go yeah no
worries advice when I haven't had a job
go for you died yeah and yeah I tend to
hold onto things Elliot are you sold on
this one or this work it's got its got
the place we need you know did a
standard power supply now yeah yes
difficult a standard ATX power supply
mount and I work about this girl we like
the window on this guy that's one of the
chill I could tell his wife was just
like if you bring any of these home
you'd like i'm going to continue to be
mad at you or whatever so i offered like
we can just take another one like they
were the cases were pretty bad shape
they weren't going to be able to be sold
to anyone besides people doing something
like this honestly if you just help you
out with the wife situation whatever
i'll take one of them if you just want
to get rid of it and and come home with
a little bit less stuff i mean I'll
probably end up recycling it honestly
but I mean if that helped that one this
one yep okay you can do that okay sir
for this guy right here no change needed
extra dollars a sign of gratitude thank
you so much this is perfect but exactly
we're looking for right now yes you just
made our day exact we should just call
it here good it's just taking his secret
is fully built with them and she's gonna
score like their and okay day to
not a lot of good committee
communication over there so I but at
least we have the lady changes working
hard drives so there's that yeah so I
heard back from a lot of guys on that
just about GTX 980 s 185 is definitely
our best deal okay this guy said 200
this guy
disgustin 175 that's a five hours
round-trip drive which I don't I I think
we shouldn't kill it yet I'll just I'll
don't don't close the coin patiently yes
yeah allium hanga hoot you did not very
considering a little bit rude but okay
so I'm not going to lie that some of the
bad news for today the place with the
bulk of the components motherboard ram
tower SSD I haven't heard back from them
to the afternoon yesterday and I've
emailed them at the end of the day
yesterday and first thing this morning
and what I said was we found the CPUs
chief or somewhere else so that freed up
some budget and I wanted to take the
tower 4:40 the motherboard 475 16 Gabe's
not 24 gigs of ram 440 which is like per
dims that's the price big games and the
128 gig SSD I didn't trying to negotiate
I left it at 25 bucks and I was like
okay that should be 200 plus tax
I haven't heard from them and they said
once you place an order it's a one-day
me time yeah we have much bigger
problems right now I see recycled pros
in Palo Alto
if they respond we could take a flight
technically flying is not against the
cruel it is a transport cost transport
costs are not within the fixed budget
Ontario Ontario Airport Hall you look up
Ontario I'll look up lax LAX is only
about an hour and a half drive from here
how are we going to transport a server
back on the plane you know what there's
a nonstop flight from 7:45 tonight to
9:00 to the chopper here
hi this might be kind of a stupid
question but is it possible to charter a
flight to San Fran from work from LA
yeah stupid what the with Dayton timer
you're looking at well that's where it
gets kind of stupid it would probably be
today so we we don't know yet
long story short we're filming a thing
and there's a part that it's that we'll
know probably within the next hour or
two there's a part that we need and it
was the only way to get it might be to
go pick it up in San Francisco so we
would need a flight up there and then a
flight back ok how many two three three
three three there's a camera operator
and just so you're aware a lot of folks
associate us with helicopters totally
correct but for a trip like this I tell
you push you towards an airplane um it's
actually going to be able to little bit
more cost-effective board you guys I've
never flown in a helicopter it would be
super cool so maybe I could get a price
for both yeah absolutely that's no
problem I hate to do this too but can I
have like kind of a ballpark like are we
looking at 2,000 or 20,000 just so I
know what I'm doing and it's roundtrip
we would need to come back so we'd
probably have to pay for an hour of
sitting on the airfield I guess is how
that works right yeah what which
operator we go raises yeah so it would
be about dick friends way okay got it
thank you
reasonable that seems like if we don't
have another choice we're gonna have to
go for it so all right well different to
bring the contents much as possible and
when you reconnect with us should have a
job for you okay okay thanks man you're
all okay okay bye well I think we need
to explore other options
so virgin has a nonstop from 6:30 to 8
o'clock from LAX to SFO so tonight is
our late pickup night that flight is
only 292 dollars so if we were to get a
hotel there or you know what we could do
here's a crazy thought what if we flew
there and drove back
I was actually kind of thinking if you
said if we like check-in the car here
say we need to pick it up again yeah and
just get it from the same guys and then
drive back
so we fly out at like 5:00 tonight or
something yeah and then just drive back
and it would be quite late when we'd get
back better for the server though -
we're going to end up here all day again
like we got to get out and get moving we
need some other ok here's what I'm going
to do I'm going to call the guy with the
CPUs the guy who works at the like film
studio maybe they have the rest of the
work station and I have other good news
the guys that I called and talked to who
were willing to do the cash deal on the
CPUs yeah but they're pricing wasn't any
better
those guys are local local Inglewood it
so they haven't replied to my email
saying all the stuff I needed though but
they're local and they said we could go
there
now I feel terrible because I was like
the guy that I've strung along for so
long was the name Justin I'm like
emailing and being like yeah what time
can we come today the earlier the better
now I look like a total hole we didn't
realize that you're in a completely
different City
because we're idiots just don't think
like we want you would like to present
it to them like later tonight if we flew
there at night we wouldn't even be able
to go into the shop they'd be closed
yeah there's earlier flight to go oh
that was the earliest one I saw are you
sure the earlier ones aren't like 17
hours with like multiple stops yeah
they'll be closed for sure unless we
were able to get on one 15 minutes ago
because I think it's like like morning
and then like evening studio guys not
picking up I'm going to call je
components here I can't believe I
overlooked that I spent all this time
like basically we built the entire
strategy around getting that bare-bones
from those guys it's like not good je
components might be an okay alternative
oh hi I called in to you guys yesterday
about we're putting together actually
it's like a gaming computer but we think
we can use some server hardware for it
okay um I did send you an email but our
situation has changed a little bit we
found a really cheap source for the CPUs
but we still need RAM motherboard
chassis and power supply and cooling as
well as a cheap SSD are we are we able
to come in like did you guys have just
kind of random dual socket motherboards
and some we're actually looking for a
tower chassis
not a rackmount chassis if possible sure
thank you so much we're kind of
desperate
honestly I haven't found anything like
as big and professional looking at these
guys
I will Oh 12:30 I know that's an hour
and a half that's not bad
got some ontario to access her - that's
a good flight yeah we'd have to know
from Justin like how much are you sighs
235 bucks
yep okay and then we'd be back by 6:30
hey Justin it's it's ash calling from
our emails yesterday if we were able to
get there before 5:00 would we be able
to get it today is it possible I think
we could go ahead make that happen
you know me your shipping address and
I'll take care of it okay great thank
you that's it okay bye
sorry to intrude hold on we might have a
slight problem should be hundred I
didn't account for tax for the SSD in
our budget the two dollars over I should
have let you negotiate on the hard drive
look you were right and I was wrong
do you feel good about it no should we
just show up and be $2 short I don't
think they're going to let us hang a
with that no these guys are like kind of
legit Michael might we're pushing our
meeting out with him another day like
we're kind of screwing Michael so we're
screwing Michael and Omid and we expect
one of them to give us a $2.00 discount
well let's get that let's get moving one
way or another like we don't have a
choice
there's no other flight not really what
time do we have to be at the airport 12
2012 20 at the airport yeah so we have
45 minutes can we get to Michael's first
oh my god and Passport you know how I'm
grabbing your eyes exit let's go where's
Michael
yeah I will forget I have mine I have
mine let's just get the party where will
these cases help pollen count our above
the competition with Luke and Linus make
their flight or they destined to be
grounded I know next time on scrapyard</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
