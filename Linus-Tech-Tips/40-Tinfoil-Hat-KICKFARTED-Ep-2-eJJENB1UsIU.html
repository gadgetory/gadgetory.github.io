be investigating the claims made by
shield head we're a company that
specializes in fashionable RF shielding
apparel to keep your head safe from the
harmful radiation that is all around us
in this digital age they say with their
shield head where signals are hundreds
of times lower inside with the shielding
effect maxing out at 60 decibels which
would mean 99.999% of the incident
radiation is blocked sounds impressive
right I mean I guess so but since I'm
not an engineer a biologist or what does
anyone listen to me anyway
the point is I'm not going to weigh in
on whether RF radiation is harmless or
the next coming of Satan himself or
somewhere in between that's beyond the
scope of this video what I am going to
do is travel to Vancouver Island to
investigate these claims with Catarina
Gustav's an EMF consultant with a
special interest in RF radiation who
notably is one of the certified
consultants listed on shield Head
where's old website though I doubt after
this video she'll be there much longer
intel skull canyon nook features a 6th
generation Core i7 quad-core processor
and Thunderbolt 3 learn more at the link
in the video description so we're not in
a lab here strictly speaking but we
believe that we've created a test
environment that's as good or better
than the one used by shield headwear so
to give you some idea of how much
control we have over our environment
with this ultra broadband antenna our
background RF level is around 3.5
microwatts per square meter thanks to
our location halfway up now matheson so
there's hardly even cell phone service
here compared to on the top of the
mountain where the radar pulses can hit
10,000 microwatts per square meter or
more this is wilderness folks moving on
to our gear the first thing we need is
our trusty hf 59 b RF meter from
gigahertz solutions this is the same one
used in the testing done by shield
headwear but it should be noted that our
setup for it is a little different we're
using the more accurate and better
shielded log periodic antenna that is
included with the hf 59 b it's actually
very unclear to us why shield headwear
opted for the one that normally ships
with gigahertz solutions lower end model
since mixing and matching can deliver
unreliable readings and while shield is
using the 2.4 gigahertz mode to filter
out anything but 2.4 gig Wi-Fi signals
we're using a high pass filter to cut
off anything below 800 megahertz though
since there is so little background RF
here this is effectively the same thing
so for our first trick
we need a baseline reading on a
bog-standard home router I grabbed a
d-link dir-655 at a distance of one and
a half meters we're looking at peaks of
around 2.2 million watts per square
meter
with no connected clients it should be
noted that due to its nature a Wi-Fi
signal will always be kind of jumpy like
this rather than giving us a solid
reading since a hat can be worn a number
of different ways for the sake of
thoroughness we decided to try several
different ways for our router to wear
the two core
beginning with kind of loosely to
represent what it might be like if it
didn't entirely cover the source of the
RF radiation and in this scenario we
observed a 10x decrease not too shabby
but not exactly hundreds of times better
either our second hat position has most
of the antennas covered and we see
another significant improvement in the
signal blocking effectiveness of the hat
leading us to our third measurement
where we carefully cover the entire
antenna array and we are able to
reproduce the results demonstrated in
shield head wares video but there's a
problem with this while the general
rules for this meter are to use as
coarse a scale as you have to but as
fine a scale as possible and for
comparative measurements you should stay
within the same scale if we use only the
course measurement like they did we
would think that we've gotten all the
way down to two micro watts per square
meter just because that's what it
displays in the course reading mode we
actually have to switch to the fine mode
to get a more accurate reading
oops a hundred micro watts per square
meter so then what would it take to get
to the two micro watt reading from
shield head where's video we tried
wrapping a second beanie on the router
being careful to eliminate any gaps in
the coverage in an attempt to simulate
the effect of a Faraday cage and it
turns out that yes while this method of
wearing the product isn't particularly
fashionable or comfortable the silver
fabric material being used is capable of
the results they demonstrated but
radiation shielding products I mean
these are things that are commercially
available and have actually engineering
that go into them are as much about the
design as they are about the materials
choice
I mean titanium is a strong material but
it wouldn't be a very good idea to wear
a solid titanium motorcycle helmet for
what I'd like to think are fairly
obvious reasons so back then to shield
head where we've recreated their test
and demonstrated that their beanie is
not as effective at blocking RF
radiation as they think it
when used in the manner demonstrated in
their video but frankly that isn't even
the main issue here
let's pick through some of the other
problems by their own admission the
material reflects signals
so when short of sticking your head into
a microwave oven which isn't recommended
by the way the biggest source of the
signals your head where is supposed to
be blocking is the phone that you've got
your face buried into why did they put a
concave reflector in the case of the
baseball cap right above your face and
why are they ignoring the findings of
these MIT students who determined that
wearing a tinfoil hat actually resulted
in a 30 decibel or 1000 fold
amplification of 2.6 gigahertz signals
when transmitted to the cranium from
receivers outside I mean as they do
point out on their website the signals
won't shoot around inside your skull
like lightsabers but will be mostly
absorbed by the various layers of tissue
in your head but like isn't that the
point of this stuff that we don't want
that and somehow their own mention of
the inconvenient truth that a true
signal blocking device would cover the
head from top to bottom that doesn't
stop them from claiming that their hat
is a personal bodyguard against
radiation and that it doesn't need to be
grounded because Faraday cages don't
need to be ground at which one is it you
guys I mean on top of that the RF meter
that they and we are using is not for
measuring in the so called Near Field
zone anyway like inside of a hat with a
smartphone next to it the way people use
phones making everything that we're
testing completely meaningless anyhow
and finally they specifically make a
point of mentioning that their head wear
is not just a tinfoil hat and we could
have pointed out the misspelling of
signal proof on their website as an
indication they aren't strong fact
checkers but for good measure we tested
that too
whipped up a frugal and imo quite
stylish aluminum foil hat tested it and
hot dad it works even better so there
you have it I'm still not qualified to
say whether Wi-Fi signals are harmful or
not I will leave that to the scientists
but what I can say with confidence is
that if you want to protect yourself
from them my homemade solution is just
as good as the 30 to 40 euro one that
you can buy on shield head where calm
though you should know that both of
these types of shielding hats may not
work as intended and may even increase
your RF exposure to your head
derp so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it was awesome get subscribed hit that
like button or check out the link to
where to buy this stuff we've featured
in the video description maybe don't buy
this stuff that's okay you can just go
to the link and buy something else also
linked in the description is our merch
store which has cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join now that you're done
doing all that stuff you're probably
wondering what to watch next so click
that little button in the top right
corner if you haven't already seen our
last episode of kick farted on the
Neptune pine a wrist mounted phone that
has dumb as it sounds</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
