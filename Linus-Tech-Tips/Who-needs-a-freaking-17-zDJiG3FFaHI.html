usually all about the extreme stuff if
it's the thinnest notebook in the world
you've got my attention if it's the
biggest baddest curve display you've got
my attention so why on earth am i
bothering to cover the dell inspiron 17
7000 series a hyper mainstream model
that bears more resemblance to my wife's
compact from college than it does to
anything else that I've ever covered on
this channel because it folds up to be a
17-inch six pound tablet
whoa mash drop is featuring the M 220
semi-open headphones from AKG boasting a
pretty steel black and white color theme
check them out at the link in the video
description
let's open up with the basics when I say
the Inspiron 17 7000 series is
mainstream I really do mean it this is a
moderately thin 17 inch machine with
solid build quality in the 900 to $1400
price range
not cheap enough to be a commodity box
made of plastic but it's not trying to
be some kind of mobile workstation
powerhouse so the hardware inside is
pretty modest keeping the overall cost
fairly low it's available with a core i5
6200 u or a core i7 6500 you but like I
mentioned in the tech quickie episode
about what I 3 i5 and i7 actually mean
the 6500 you while an i7 is actually a
dual-core hyper-threaded 15 watt
low-power skew not designed for more
than moderate productivity or light
content creation or gaming anyway mine
is the middle of the road model rocking
the core i7 processor option 16 gigs of
DDR 4 RAM a 128 gig SSD with a one
terabyte hard drive for overflow and a
geforce 940 mx2 gig dedicated graphics
card something I was pleased to see even
on the entry-level model since a DGP you
can make a big difference in certain
video editing workloads as I covered in
my can you edit 4k video on an ultrabook
video here in terms of i/o on the right
is an SD card reader and a are you for
serious right now dell starting to
remember why i don't cover mainstream
stuff a USB 2 port this I got to see for
myself yeah that's a USB 2 port damnit
Dell anyway on the left is a headphone
microphone jack a USB 3 port an HDMI 1.4
port and a USB type-c port that will
handle USB and DisplayPort duties and
you can actually charge the laptop with
it
so that's kind of cool I guess even if
the IO isn't impressive at least I can
find some comfort in the solid
construction good build quality actually
doesn't really surprise me anymore since
everything Dell has shipped me since
they took the company private again has
been very solid for the price and the
inspiring 17 7000 continues this trend
the palm rests don't really flex unless
you put a lot of pressure on them the
speakers are surprisingly good for
bottom mounted ones and don't suffer
from that sounds like it's coming from
behind you thing that i've experienced
before and the webcam is a solid pretty
good though if I was using this
regularly for video conferencing I would
probably wish for a better microphone
moving on to the experiential things the
keyboard is a little spongy but it's
quiet and didn't slow me down too much
with a basically bog-standard layout and
the number pad being one of the nicest
things about carrying around something
this size side note I'm glad keyboard
back lights are standard now the
touchpad tracks well and is thankfully
an appropriate size for the 17 inch
1080p IPS touchscreen display another
huge improvement over the displays of
mainstream notebooks of yore and I
hadn't really used Windows hello much
but the facial recognition from the
integrated IR camera is really really
fast even in pretty poor conditions
though I haven't experimented much with
having other people try to break through
it so your mileage may vary let's talk
about the killer app now though the
laptop by day tablet by night
two-in-one conversion that can be done
with a quick back flip of the LCD panel
honestly whether it was watching movies
playing casual touchscreen games or what
else do people even do on tablets
I really wasn't sold on this feature
dales promotional images are all focused
on touchscreen DJing applications and
people enjoying concerts so I guess
there's a market there that they're
going to go in and corner but from an
average users perspective the weight
something Dell either forgot or
conveniently omitted from the product
page and size end up being more of a
hindrance than a help for the Inspiron
17 7000 in this operating mode but
that's okay as long as the tablet mode
doesn't hurt the way it functions as a
normal laptop so does it in a couple
ways maybe but not much the display is a
bit heavier making actual laptop
operation less feasible since it's
poorly balanced and will easily fall off
your knees if you move around too much
and my guess is that the 360 degree
hinge is the reason that it can't be
lifted with one finger but that's about
it
screen wobble which some of you are
probably noticing when I bang on this
table is almost entirely due to this
table being unstable it's not a laptop
issue so then if I was to completely
ignore the two in oneness there's a lot
to like here battery life is really
solid thermals are a strong point with
the aluminum chassis remaining at much
lower temperatures than I'm accustomed
to with all the gaming laptops that come
through here even while under heavy CPU
load and on that note the dedicated GPU
doesn't cause overheating either even
when it's working hard at the latest
casual games like Lego Batman 2 making
this machine suitable for keeping the
kids busy as long as they don't expect
to be playing the latest triple-a titles
at 4k or whatever this is what tomb
raider looks like by the way at 720p all
lowest details not pretty especially at
less than 30 FPS so that's the bottom
line here then if you can forgive the
wait something folks who desire a 17
inch laptop are probably going to have
to deal
with one way or the other the inspiring
17 7000 gets a solid recommendation even
if I personally think the tablet mode
contributes nothing to the experience
and beyond that made me feel kind of
ridiculous while using it every time I
do one of these spots for blue apron it
kind of annoys me because they're not
available in Canada yet and I have heard
absolutely rave reviews about the
service it's really cool so blue apron
allows you to create delicious chef
designed recipes at home they deliver
all the farm-fresh ingredients that you
need right to your doorstep in exactly
the right proportions no unnecessary
trips to the grocery store no wasted
food and they're delivered in a
refrigerated box so the ingredients will
stay fresh even if you're not at home
when your package arrives they offer two
types of plans the two-person plan and
the family plan and there is no
commitment you can skip or cancel the
service at any time the meals are
between 500 to 800 calories per person
and can be prepared in 40 minutes or
less which is actually from my rough
napkin mouth less than the time that it
takes for me to gather up all the kids
go out to somewhere for take-out and
carry at home I mean it's actually more
efficient to just make my own food and
it's better for you so blue apron offers
a large selection of recipes and is
always adding new dishes and if all of
this sounds appealing to you all you got
to do is be one of the first 100 people
