for being the first full touchscreen
phone I ever used so while my daily
driver is usually an HTC One m8
I appreciate the simplicity and
functionality of iOS and I've been known
in the past to say I pretty much don't
have a preference today that changes but
which way does it go well I guess you'll
have to watch the video
no spoilers Corsair gaming RGB keyboards
feature precision Cherry MX RGB key
switches for sixteen point eight million
color perky backlighting for virtually
unlimited customization click now to
learn more we'll kick things off with
the speeds and feeds it's got a
dual-core 1.4 gigahertz a a8 chip with a
gig of ram 16 to 128 gigs of internal
storage and 1810 milliamp hour battery
and a 4.7 inch 1334 by 750 display but
don't let any of those very middle
expects scare you off too much a 16 gig
base model with no microSD expansion at
650 dollars is embarrassing but
everything else is pretty much fine
chorus and gigahertz are meaningless
without considering the underlying
architecture in fact we'll have a video
coming in the future that really dives
into this subject so make sure you're
subscribed so you don't miss it
Ram only affects performance when
multitasking or with background
processes running and iOS 8 doesn't
raise the bar when it comes to using
multiple apps at the same time nor does
it lower it when it comes to expertly
managing idle resource use so you don't
need a ton of RAM and then the battery
also benefits from that same resource
management and I easily ended up with 30
to 40% battery at the end of a medium
workload day as for the resolution I'll
talk more about that one later I think
physically then if you've seen one
iPhone you really have seen them all
haven't yet the back has an Apple logo
two antenna bends that the internet
seems to care about a lot for some
reason but I think is fine a mic a dual
LED flash that works stunningly well
even in pitch darkness at close range
and an 8 megapixel camera whose f 2.0
sapphire blast lens for truths from the
casing in a way that I thought was a big
deal when I heard about it at first but
hasn't bothered me at
all when using the phone on the top we
see nothing but the six point nine
millimeter thick profile of the phone on
the left is a mute button in a volume
button and another volume button I guess
on the bottom is a headphone jack
lightning connector and a speaker and on
the right is a nano SIM tray and a lock
button the first significant change one
that I almost really like it's better
than having it on the top since the
iPhone is no longer a one-handed affair
but Apple managed to commit the sin of
having a lock button that opposes other
buttons in this case the volume rockers
so it's easy to change volume when
reaching for the lock which brings us
around to the front at the top is a
disappointing 1.2 megapixel camera love
or hate selfies guys you got to
acknowledge that people take them and I
think HTC made a smart move here an
earpiece speaker and then on the chin
bar the classic iDevice button with a
new trick up its sleeve touch ID is
still awesome and a just plain faster
way to unlock your phone by apps and by
regular stuff with the just launched
Apple pay service but now you get a
double touch that what moves the entire
UI down to Wow more on that later the
screen itself boasts 100% srgb color
looks beautiful from all angles is super
bright maybe even too bright for me when
using it at night with great contrast so
it can easily be used outdoors and it
has such smooth auto brightness that I
completely forgot I had it on and then
back to the resolution which I promised
to touch on again to me the iPhone 6 is
Apple's statement to the world that the
pixel count race something they started
with the iPhone 4 is over and I think
they're right however random 750 P might
be at this size it's just plain good
enough something I actually talk about
in both my moto x review and my LG g3
review I did have some complaints though
well I loved the extra screen size for
watching videos compared to the 5s and a
four and a half to 5 inch it is really
my sweet spot for screen size which is
why you won't likely see an iPhone 6
plus review from me and while the design
is beautiful and so elegant the way the
glass itself is rounded into the
aluminum unibody compared to the Moto X
is flat glass with a rounded housing
this causes
unavoidable reflections to show up
around the edge of your content
something that I did find a little
distracting but not nearly as bothersome
as the general economics and usability
of the device now I already wind about
the lock button the bottom speaker is
still a relic of a bygone age but one
that we I guess we expect from Apple but
on my podcast when rumors of larger
iPhones first started circulating I
pointed out that because of the way back
buttons are in the top-left and text
entry fields or top-center things that
are fine for one-handed use on a small
device Apple would need to rethink their
navigation and this two touch thing was
not what I had in mind it helps a bit I
can search for our contact or navigate
back in an app more easily but it
doesn't work across the board even in
Apple's own OS I mean why do I need to
reach way up there to take advantage of
the much improved spotlight feature and
even with this feature Apple's UI moves
you around on the screen so much that
combined with the incredibly light
design and rounded sides this phone is
one of the most slippery fish that I've
ever used
even with this de brand carbon fiber
wrap on it on top of that I feel like
aside from content consumption I'm not
really getting anything extra from the
bigger screen anyway most UI elements
are just blown up and while I do get an
extra row of home screen icons the only
solution to move in my frequently used
stuff to the bottom right is still to
fill the top rows with crap that I don't
use as often for shame Apple and I guess
since we've already started down this
path I might as well do the rest of my
ranty stuff now iOS still doesn't allow
landscape lock on small screen devices
this seems like such a small thing to
ask for for those of us who use our
phones in bed a lot sharing options are
still very inflexible I know you have an
email client built into the phone and
you have your own cloud storage but I
don't use them I use Gmail and Dropbox
and you're making my life slower Apple
and last but not least I can call people
with my voice through the contact list
through recent in a message and now even
by double clicking and selecting
favorites way up at the top of the
screen or I can double click
yes but none of these are as fast and as
versatile as t9 dialing Apple please
just implement this back to good stuff
though the camera rocks it's lightning
fast to launch autofocus is so fast you
hardly even notice it it captures great
images without thinking about it and can
even do 60fps 1080p and 240 FPS 720p
capture the default app is still pretty
limited you can take lightning fast
burst photos you can tweak exposure very
easily but and that's about it and now
that they're adding more camera modes I
really don't think the swipe to change
modes model is that great anymore maybe
square could take a hike in the next
update or they could come up with
something a little bit better but I mean
part of the beauty of you know Apple's
camera app is the simplicity and the
good news is that they now allow
third-party camera app so manual control
gigs can get their jollies by using bows
as long as they don't want to change the
aperture which isn't supported at this
time
speaking of third-party app support
though iOS finally supports third-party
keyboards which is good because I found
the stock ones prediction just plain not
useful and while I appreciate the
forward and back arrows due to Apple's
otherwise slow cursor positioning method
the landscape layout moves everything so
close to the middle of the phone that
for me to reach it comfortably is just
not that great it's just too bad that
Swift Keys iOS keyboard sucks so far
it's super responsive and I really
wanted to like it but the spacebar
position moves in certain particularly
social media apps a behavior that you
can't turn off and you can't access a
secondary layer of functionality on all
the keys by pressing and holding that
feature combined with the user
adjustable hold down delay has made
SwiftKey my go-to on Android I it's not
there yet here hopefully they get there
in time but it's still very early days I
got a notification there are a lot of
other little improvements that come with
iOS 8 as well Mac rumors has a great
list of them that'll link in the video
description but some standouts are these
recording last location and Find My
iPhone before the battery dies using
Siri to ID son so you don't need Shazam
any more Wi-Fi calling if your carrier
supports it calling out hey Siri when
the device is plugged in to activate
what is still my favorite voice control
method easier insertion of photos and
messages sending out a randomized MAC
address when scanning for Wi-Fi networks
some health crap that I don't care about
at all and the coolest thing of all I
really did save the best for last here
family sharing I mean imagine that Apple
being the one to follow Valve's lead and
let us share the digital crap we bought
with the people who live with us
in the same way that we used to be able
to do with physical stuff it works with
apps music books and more and I applaud
Apple for being forward-thinking in this
regard which leads to the conclusion
which oh sorry right first the
obligatory right this thing is actually
a phone bit call quality on my side was
excellent I received no complaints about
the mic from the other side and now the
conclusion it's an iPhone if you don't
like I phones it's not going to change
your mind and if you like iPhones and
thought they should be bigger then go
buy it or the even larger plus version
because let's face it you were going to
do that anyway but for me the rate at
which Android continues to improve and
the way that iOS with the exception of
little things like family sharing
continues to not really take huge
strides forward and the way that it
didn't adapt correctly to the larger
devices is a real stumbling block
whatever the iPhone sales figures might
look like anyway when the time comes
whether you're buying an iPhone or some
other thing maybe consider getting a D
brand skinners de brand skin excuse me
to go with it they generously provided
us with the skinned iphone 6 that you
saw in this review just so I could do
this review and in the link in the video
description you'll find details for the
ten skins that they're also giving away
two lucky Linus tech tips viewers so
they're obviously good guys all around
and if them being good guys isn't enough
for you to think about buying vinyl
wraps for your controllers consoles
phones and other devices from them then
consider also the high quality of their
products in the excellent fit and finish
that you got to enjoy during all the
macro footage of the phone that you saw
on this video they really are an
excellent way to gussy up your phone and
also protect its finish if you
frequently lay it down flat on surfaces
the way that I do I do have an affiliate
link for it to brand so if you want to
you can head to de brand comm slash
Linus tech tip
but I don't think I get a kickback or
anything so don't stress about the link
too much just remember they're cool guys
and they make skins for phones and
consoles and controllers and cool stuff
like that
and so you guys are cool guys too I
think for sitting all the way through
this video well over 10 minutes about
iPhones to meeting you didn't die thank
you for watching and not falling asleep
like it if you liked it dislike it if
you disliked it leave a comment letting
me know your thoughts on the iPhone 6 do
you desperately need me to review the 6
plus given that it's basically the same
thing but even bigger and even more
awkward to hold I think that pretty much
wraps it up check the link in the video
description if you want to support us
you can give us a monthly contribution
buy a cool t-shirt like this one or it's
change your Amazon bookmarks with one
for affiliate code whenever you want to
buy an iPhone say for example I think
that's pretty much it thanks for
watching and as always don't forget to
subscribe
