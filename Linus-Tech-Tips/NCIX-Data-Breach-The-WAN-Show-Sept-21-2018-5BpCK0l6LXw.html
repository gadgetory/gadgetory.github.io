of a show the best 20 minutes ever it
was pretty great actually it was also to
the test channel and not to the live
channel that's not you it's the opposite
of you guys yeah so so we're back hey
how's it goin we got a bunch of great
news this week we definitely haven't
talked about before are already in a
different previous version of the show
there's something I've never read before
and sigh NCIX had a data breach some of
the people we actually know in our lives
are really affected by this yeah Wow
largely even people that work here also
Amazon has new hardware including like a
microwave and a subwoofer and some weird
weird stuff and guess what China
Google's back and they want you to
search for stuff using their service but
this time they're ready to play by the
government's rules what will that mean
news at 11 also Vulcan one point one
point eight five is releasing with
ray-tracing and video extensions which
is good even if you don't like
ray-tracing
because that means that maybe there will
be more Vulcan in the world which is
good for you and your friend live long
and roll the intro
we've done this already whoa awesome so
starting from the top again we've got
the NC X data breach I think this is
pretty important to talk about so we're
just gonna do the whole thing over again
this was originally posted by privacy
fly comm it's like the I think it's the
only article on their site but I could
be totally wrong but you'll see it in
the description if you want to check it
out if you're watching the vaad and it's
it's quite it's quite the adventure
we're gonna skim over a lot of it but if
you're even remotely interested I would
recommend checking out the original
article and reading it yeah even if
you're not if it's the if it would be
the first leak or security thing for
which you actually read the detailed
description yeah it's a treat this would
be the first one to do it
yeah yeah it's really cool it's like
it's like a story it's gripping it is
yeah it's it gets really deep into it as
you can see it's like really written out
what happened here it all starts on
Craigslist naturally yeah
Travis during hope I'm saying your last
name correctly sees two database servers
from ncx
for sale on Craigslist asks the guy if
it still has the original data on it guy
takes forever to respond but does
eventually respond with yes original
data is intact and it just goes from
there it's a pretty wild ride hey yeah
yeah we were streaming to the test
Channel yeah that sucked for like a long
time there's apparently new instructions
on how to run the LAN show and the
instructions were behind everything
so yes hi everyone hi NIC is here and
he's happy that Luke's here yeah anyways
there was a lot of information in this
leak this is not a standard leak usually
when you hear like Oh website
information leaks there will be a set
amount of user accounts or all user
accounts but it's usually just the
username and password that gets leaked
which is really bad to be clear but this
is like
many many many levels beyond that this
was all your credit card information all
your payment information in general so
if you played with PayPal or something
else addresses full names passwords all
of it unencrypted all of it in Greece's
Social Insurance numbers for employees
yes for employees there were Social
Insurance numbers T fours oh that's
right address data like historically
over time all the employment information
which is usually pretty heavy in terms
of like I'm a steal your life bro all of
that was was available o pretty-pretty
ooof so the story there was that there
was a warehouse that ncx had other junk
in and but they didn't own the warehouse
there were tenants there so when they
went bankrupt there their rent was
overdue to the tune of a hundred fifty
thousand dollars so in order to try to
pay for it they just said just keep all
the junk that we have in there so then
the landlord has all these servers and
desktops like hundreds of desktops
computers and he's trying to sell them
so then this uh this third party this
company comes in and says well that
stuff's useful to us because of this
project were working on so there's this
guy named Jeff that works for that
company Jeff that's all we really know
my name is Jeff and he's brokering the
deal so he he brokers the deal and gets
to this company what they want but then
he doesn't he doesn't stop there one
more thing I'm gonna sell this data
multiple time some multiple different
people some of these people are come
from overseas there's one individual who
was supposed to come in December to pick
up some of the hardware the guy was from
trying it like this is yeah crazy yeah
there's actually a tweet that just
happened earlier today from the RCMP
right which is the police in Canada and
they said that they seized the hardware
now really yeah that was pretty fast
not fast enough yeah sold like seven
times for like 35 grand or well it's
gone it's super gone I'm just happy that
once this article came out which was
like a day or two ago they've already
got everything I love other tweet
doesn't specify it's just like yeah
there's a company you may have heard of
they're now defunct but they're pretty
I said afternoon we opened an
investigation into date some people
listen so we got a yeah we opened an
investigation into data storage devices
being sold online allegedly containing
allegedly you know dude
anyways containing customer data from a
defunct but well-known computer retailer
we have since recovered the storage
devices our investigation is active and
ongoing so them recovering the storage
devices unfortunately well I'm like oh
I'm happy they did that means
effectively nothing because the data has
been copied multiple times and resold
there's actually more places to buy it
from now yes and like even the original
guy was like do you want to buy all the
hardware because I have the important
stuff backed up and I'm reselling it
anyways so you can buy all the hard way
it was way cheaper to buy just the data
was 15 grand instead of 35 yeah so the
dude was like well no so like yeah the
season the hardware like good job guys
and you know the allegedly having
customer data good job on not being sure
yet but it's just so scary how much
different this feels to me you've read
about hacks like this all the time
Equifax was a big one of the states that
affected many many people yeah didn't
affect me so I didn't really care that
much but when the screenshots have towns
like Chilliwack Whitlam Langley that are
right around us something you're looking
at you're looking at the at the
spreadsheet tracing that line across
from the town and finding a name and
thinking like oh I might know the name
that's right there yeah so here's here's
some database snapshots
yeah that's of the the top one seems to
be of an American database and the
second one seems to be of a Canadian
database so if someone bought this data
what could they do with it to screw you
they can do a lot where we're actually
getting into a part of this that we
didn't get into last time but they they
could do actually a lot especially with
employees so I'm gonna jump back
slightly and cover the different levels
of data leak that had happened so for
customers like I had already said
your full name your address your payment
information your password all that kind
of stuff plaintext that's a lot there's
a lot they can do with that already
now I'm gonna jump to other people
however as you can see up here someone's
t4 leaked there there's social security
numbers what is that the right one I
always get them confused and I've both
social insurance number
social insurance is that Canadian yeah
so your social insurance number your
like your residential history because
you have to update that with your
employer all the time your first name
your last name your middle name like
everything that an employer would need
to legally employ you which is a lot
leaked so that's pretty bad so let's go
from the customer standpoint first they
could take credit out on your credit
card they could cash out your credit
card they could do those like terrible
check things for your credit now would
your the information that leaked it
would have to be of a credit card that's
still active yes so I think that that is
definitely a subset of the data
yeah because to be clear as well this
data goes back forever but only as
recent as 2017 well yeah because credit
cards are they went under every years so
if your credit card yes but you could
renew credit card and keep the number so
you could have the same information yeah
I'm pretty yeah yeah I'm pretty sure
there's one credit card that I have to
know now
dang which kind of sucks because you
like that one well it's just I've just
been using it for a long time so there's
like some recurring billing on it that
I'm gonna have to kill and yeah we set
up it's just annoying but they don't
have my more important one so hahaha but
yeah they could they could mess with
your credit if they already have that if
if you paid with PayPal they probably
have your account information because
your account most PayPal accounts that I
know of are set up based on the email
and you would probably give them the
email if you tried to pay through PayPal
if your password if you have that if you
share that password elsewhere well
nothing
that's what it's called right they I've
been watching that hair in your mouth
tried to get rid of it like subtly who's
talking I'm looking at it from the side
and the way the lighting is I can
totally see this long-haired even over
Cambridge I mean its longest Lea I even
filled this cup and I just took a drink
so I'm a little there's this long hair
sticking out of his mouth and then he
finishes his sentence goes and I can see
it's totally inhaled it I was like oh my
god okay sorry keep going yeah I know we
were talking about we were talking about
pass route
oh yes stuffing is when let's say
LinkedIn gets hacked they take your
password well then you can just take
that password and assume that someone
uses the password in law different sites
and they just brute force it on lots of
different sites so you get hacked stuff
that password and username into
everything essentially just because
LinkedIn got hacked doesn't mean it's
the only target for you to get pwned
that's why you should have something
like a password manager and have unique
passwords for every single service and
website owned whatever that you use but
anyways so password could be a vector
for attack they also have your your full
name and your address and stuff so there
could be some relatively minor ish but
there definitely could be some identity
theft going on like they send you
flowers on Valentine's Day and just just
to screw with your relationship like if
they have your full job they have your
your full credit card number your full
address in your full name it's
relatively easy to convince different
institutions that you are that person
it's actually not that hard because of
social engineering there it's it's
surprisingly easy to convince people
because most people working for a
company don't want to do as much work
and it's more work to verify that you're
the person that you say you are
especially when you're like oh it's I
they ask you what your address is or
they ask you certain information about
yourself if you have that and if you
have the person's full name if you have
their address and you have their credit
number you can probably get a little bit
of other information and if you get a
little bit about other information and
you use the right tone and you assert
yourself in the right way you can often
get access to additional things now it's
hopefully you get people who are as
judicious as people I've had in the past
where they asked me for my postal code
and I go I don't know what it is and
they're like well sorry and I'm like you
realize I can google it you can go
online and just kind of the post has
that's a service or you just type in an
address and yeah address at all and it
gives you the postal code I'm like if
I'm trying to hone James Drive right I
don't actually have a postal code my
hand like this is really easy to find
social engineering is like a big deal
and and this would give someone an
insane amount of ammo for social
engineering now beyond that if you'd
only one who worked for NCIS this is
where it gets really bad because they
have their social insurance social
insurance number I keep on sand ones
which having their sin is really brutal
because basically no one has other
people's sin numbers so in terms of
pulling identity theft stuff they have a
major vector to screw with you at this
point especially if they have your
residential history and your sin because
as far as I know those two things
combined is like what you need to get
your birth certificate reprinted and if
they get your birth certificate they can
get pretty much any other government ID
so they can get driver's licenses they
can get whatever and at that point
you're screwed over you're done even if
they don't have all that and all they
have is like the name of an institution
that you use and your address you are
they already or your email address they
can already make convincing phishing
attacks oh yeah which are enough to pone
most people yeah including politicians
yeah it's so this is very bad and and
and I guess the original route question
I think was what can you do to protect
yourself there's a well
but okay that's not thought it was but
sure okay there's not much left so we'll
go there if you're a standard user let's
go back from that if you just purchase
things from ncx update your passwords
make sure there's no other password that
shared this password I cancel any credit
are you me in the password that you used
at like a Nancy I had an insight yeah
yeah most people as far as I know we're
all mine shoppers so yeah make make sure
that you change your change your other
passwords if you had other passwords
that shared a password with ncx comm but
seriously in this day and age you need
to make sure you're not sharing
passwords across websites this kind of
stuff happens all the time get on top of
it it's it's too late at this point
figure it out
outside of that cancel any credit cards
that you may have even possibly used
there as far as I know you can't like
check what one you had well this is my
other question is is there a way to
figure out whether or not you were
leaked right no as of right now no this
privacy fly guy I don't know if he ended
up actually buying the data set or not
it says that they like made in a
agreement to buy it and then he like
walked out of the building and then
that's the end of the story
spoilers dude jeez sorry that's a good
point
what's an interesting sir I would want
to read it so I don't know if he has it
other people do have it but it hasn't
leaked publicly like there isn't in it
there isn't a web site out there with
all of this stuff publicly on it so
there's no way to check specifically if
you are in there but like if you've ever
bought something from ncx or if you ever
worked with ncx you're in there so do
you think now that the RCMP have it that
they will maybe release a list of names
of people who got pwned I wouldn't trust
it anyways if you've ever that seems
like a fairly easy set of like if
statements have you ever worked there no
have you ever bought anything from there
ever yes well done dry crack in my brain
I know I think I may have bought one
from a physical location I think I may
have bought like an HDMI cable once hmm
but then I kind of think I bought it
with a company credit card I was doing
it for my other job don't know I would I
would be safe at a minimum if you're an
employee like yeah so if you're a
customer change whatever passwords that
might be the same cancel your old credit
card get a new credit card and forget
about it
you'll be okay for the most part you
might get you might get like there might
be people trying to do a minor identity
theft to you but that's that's gonna be
basically a constant that's just a thing
with the internet these days and there's
probably no information in there that
couldn't be found if someone cared
enough anyways so I would be like a a
little bit a little bit of heightened
awareness over the next little while if
you receive any emails about like your
password has been reset on some website
or something like you know have some
heightened awareness for a bit but other
than that you should be ok if you're an
employee I'm not versed enough in this
stuff to properly tell you what to do
you need to look into it yourself but
think certain things that you can do is
what obviously change all your credit
card stuff because you probably bought
stuff from the store and - I believe in
Canada you can get your sin changed I'm
not sure I do know you can get a credit
freeze which like freezes your credit
for about a year I think is the the
average time that they do this for and
you would still be able to like if you
wanted to go buy a house or a car or
something like that and you needed
credit you would still be able to go get
it but like low level credit application
stuff is going to be frozen for a year
send change is a rough go send change is
a very well you're gonna wait in line in
those buildings that you don't like
going to yeah for a long time you're
gonna show up there and finally get to
the front line and they're gonna say oh
you didn't bring the right ID you have
to go back take more time off work do it
again but you might want to anyways to
be completely honest I need to do some
more research but I think they might not
have mine because I think I was a
contractor and I think my contracting
agreement thing was
like if no leaks it's in the contract
yeah well no like I think it's it's like
buy my fake little company name thing
which is legal because I didn't make
enough money because they underpaid me
to an almost criminal level actually to
just yeah anyways that's a different
conversation
I like that might leak but it's not even
a real company and there's nothing to
look up there yeah like I think I'm
mostly okay but like Riley's dead he's
we buried him this morning exactly -
Ivan a few other people that I know are
already left the country there's gonna
be work for them in terms of covering
themselves from this this is this is
like really really brutal it's uh yeah
but with that let's finally talk about
other news its keynote season baby
yeah Apple stuff Amazon stuff Google
events coming up that's my favorite one
well I'm hoping I'm hoping the pixel
three is sweet cuz I need a new phone
this is this is my pixel 1 XL ooh I want
the mini pixel the non XL yeah I want it
this is an s9 plus it's beautiful but
it's 2 + do a lot of one-handed and I
just want a smaller one in I want to be
able to my phone in the front pocket of
my jeans again so Chad said stop giving
clues to the hackers they're way ahead
of us they're way ahead of us
that's it and if those are clues like
holy crap talk about the pixel no it's
got a pixel I think he's talking about
yeah but people the names yeah it's all
over its known already they absolutely
know I imagine there's someone watching
this stream you like wait no wait this
Linus worked at NCIX hold my beer oh my
god or like what they could do with the
data dude if they're gonna spend like 15
plus thousand dollars on some data
they're probably gonna know what to do
with it and they've probably done that
kind of stuff in the past we said we're
moving on damn it
so the point was Amazon somehow snuck up
and
a hardware event that was a bit of a
surprise there were like some leaks but
ya caught most people off-guard and what
I loved about their approach to hardware
is this is just a total shock gun blast
yeah they don't it's like there's a
spectrum of we care a lot and try not to
release junk that's Apple on that one
end that's why I put the word try in
there and then summer and then further
along down you've got Google it's like
yeah they care a lot and then on the
other end you've probably got like
Xiaomi
Xiaomi and and and Amazon with Amazon's
like we're just trying junk we're just
gonna put a screen on this one this
one's gonna have a big subwoofer on it
they release like 10 different new
things and it's what I think is cool is
that they're back they're like guinea
pigs like cuz then a year later Google
release like a copycat version of one of
these yeah so let's just go through some
of the stuff
it starts off pretty tame you start off
with some echo dots which is just like a
really small echo no equi dots all of
those well there's a couple things that
they upgrade it it looks like yeah maybe
upgraded versions or newer versions but
then immediately you get into like what
the heck the echo echo auto and in-car
accessory that allows you to integrate
Alexa into your car so here's the weird
thing you can plug it in two different
ways you can plug it in with a 3.5
millimeter aux jack or by connecting
over a smartphone's existing Bluetooth
setup to the car but you cannot just
directly your Bluetooth the device to
the car okay apparently there's a slight
catch it's not ready and it's only
available by invitation
well yeah these the different items on
this list have kind of a staggered
rollout some things you can pre-order
right now some things you can't even
pre-order yet this this auto one it gets
powered by a cigarette lighter like one
of those cigarette lighter yeah adapters
that goes into you like a mini USB so
you've got that one cord for sure and
then then you also have to either do the
Bluetooth through a phone but if you
don't do that you've got the 3.5
millimeter jack so then that's possibly
two cords coming out of this thing
into your car but if it's okay if it's
how does it bridge onto the Bluetooth of
your phone because Bluetooth can only
connect to one thing yeah I don't know
it's weird and then it's it's just Alexa
capability in the car like it's maybe
hain 50 bucks because you really can't
not talk to Alexa for like you're just
driving to work you know what I need
more toilet paper now this set all my
best thinking's done in the car alright
let's not dwell we've got like nine
things to go through Amazon echo sub if
you've got a lot of different echo
devices in your house and you have them
hooked up in like a multi room speaker
array well it's time you had a six inch
100 watt subwoofer to go with those so
this is a sub u sorry hold on there's a
super chat thing which sorry guys we're
not gonna read all these
hold the phone what's the difference
between tech linked and tech quickie
they seem the same why have both have
you even watched them thank you for your
$5 donation one has an orange and blue
background yeah yeah there has a white
background it's so different like
seriously guys
one is a Daily News show where they look
at the news of that day at a report on
it
in a quick fashion that's tech linked
and then one is a video of explainers
these videos tend to be more evergreen
in that you might look up the definition
of HDMI today or three years from now
that content it's kind of like an
encyclopedia of tech definitions the
idea behind that's tech quickie
originally was last night we're talking
about how like our mom or a friend or
someone might be in a store or be
shopping for something and see a name of
something like HDMI or Core i7 and be
like I don't know what that means I
don't know what value this brings to me
and we wanted to make more or less a
repository of information on those types
of things that's why a lot of the
original videos were as basic as what is
HDMI and it's gotten into a little bit
more higher level topics over time
because you run out of those things
pretty quick but it's it's explainers
it's if you ever ask yourself
kind of a tech question of like how does
this work why can't I use that why can't
I use my phone run him on the airplane
yeah that kind of stuff as long as it's
in the tech realm then tech work you
might have it then Tech linked is Daily
News they're like really really wildly
different
thank you for your super chat though and
you would subscribe to everything yeah
let's continue so we have the echo sub
130 bucks for one that's quite a lot
that's a lot that's a lot and it's a
6-inch sub it's like it's gonna be this
big yeah that's a lot and you have to
pair with other echo things so I don't
know does that mean you can talk to it
like does it have a microphone or a oh I
think so and all that and if it talks
back is it just like write a word loop
they should have like the only voice
that can speak through it should be like
Morgan Freeman or like Earl Jones yeah
yeah I am the subwoofer there's other
sound companion things because there's
the echo link app the echo sub and the
echo input the echo link amp that thing
is sorry actually if I'm in the Google
ecosystem and mostly because the the
Amazon stuff comes to Canada way later
and and whatever yeah that's probably
one I would want that because you can as
far as I can assume is you can still
plug in all your own speakers and stuff
that's right so yeah for me I have
really old like from the 90s clips
towers great yeah they're wicked yeah
and I wanted to have a cool-looking amp
for them to going cuz I had a JVC one
that I got for Christmas as a kid and
they had lots of buttons on it and I had
like I was going whose hair is this I
wanted a s'more stylish amp fruit for my
you know the shelf in the living room
that's all hip looking yeah but there's
just too many knobs of and it
doesn't it doesn't look nice so then I
ended up having to go to like I went
online I was like can I get like a you
know the old look the vintage look where
they were just they were just aluminum
just polished and there's just one nice
big knob and that's about it
who doesn't want that and so I ended up
having to go to a vintage store I've got
refurbished stuff in order to get one
because there's just no I couldn't find
any new stuff that that had that kind of
aesthetic this kind of does it's kinda
it's black it's not silver but it's
black and it's really clean I know you
use that it does have her just white
yeah and you could it's kind of like the
only weird thing about it is that it is
just one single of a big knob because
usually they would be like wider and
more boxy
this one has some curves to it and it's
just the knob instead of all the other
inputs and funds but it's still metal
but it but it does a clean-looking sort
of you can plug your old speakers into
it and you've got basically this smart
speaker setup you've got all the Alexa
abilities on your awesome older speakers
yeah oh that's cool yeah and then
they've got this the input the in okay
so the input is basically an echo dot
with no speaker so the echo dot is is
like the Google home mini it's really
small it's like the size of a puck it's
got a speaker that sucks you can talk to
it answers you it's 50 bucks this new
one is fifteen dollars cheaper get rid
of the speaker you've just got this
microphone puck that you plug into an
existing speaker and piggyback off of
that which is cool what I actually
really want so the this thing is the
echo link or the echo link amp it's two
versions which are physically the same
thing I'm guessing one of them is just
not actually an amplifier and the other
one is I'm assuming because the echo
link amp is the same thing as the echo
link but with a 60 watt stereo amplifier
inside so the other one doesn't have
that and even when it doesn't have the
amplifier it's 200 bucks and with the AM
it's three 300 bucks yeah some user hmm
man some of these devices are serious
investments like the Google home max
isn't that like an Xbox yeah holy crap
sorry to cut you off
yeah but the Google home max is like 500
bucks so expense like you can get a good
speaker like in the Google home max is a
good speaker but you can get some good
speakers for that it's like it's it's
crazy
and the the input is 35 like where's
this Delta it's so weird
what I really want is something even
more slim down than the input I want
just a microphone
seriously I'm in my house and in my
house the Google home can hear me
anywhere if it's in the middle of night
I can be in my bed and whisper it can
but if I'm a foot away from it with
music on high so I wanted to just have
like the smallest possible form factor
just a little microphone that I can just
I can just be like Nixon and just hide
them around my house amazon firetv
recast a DVR box that can store TV shows
and movies for viewing at home or
on-the-go
will release on November 14th and start
at 230 bucks Wow why are they all so
expensive I can't even see that in here
by the way I don't think that's in this
article but I believe it that's crazy
some of these have funny names too ring
stick up camera
they bought ring ring is a home security
come your doorbell that goes to your
phone and you can this is a security
camera so you can you can look through
it you can talk to people through it you
can make a siren noise if you want all
through your phone and 180 bucks for one
of those camera the ring stick up camera
set to release on October 18th unless
you see here and speak to people from
your tablet phone PC here's a nun with a
funny name Amazon smart plug that's me
adds voice controlled anything plugged
in and will cost 25 bucks when released
on October 11th so it's you plug it into
your wall you plug another thing into it
like a dumb thing yeah like a lamp that
doesn't have a Phillips u in it yeah
yeah and then you just turn it off and
you can do schedules too so you can hook
up a bunch of crap like that into it and
then say after six o'clock turn off or
you can be it be at work oh I left that
on so I'm gonna shut it off and remotely
they released an analog wall clock with
echo so yeah so what that thing I know I
there this is what I like about them the
just like why not this is the most
shotgun approach the best it's 30 bucks
and it basically is a visualization tool
for the timers that you said yeah so one
of the most useful things on any of
these assistants is hey set a timer for
30 minutes yeah and what I usually do is
I see I say hey how much time left on
the timer it'll be 18 minutes left with
this you don't need to ask again you can
just glance up and the clock it's like
look it's like a countdown analog wall
clock that you'd now have again like
those clocks at the swimming pool that
have like all the different yeah it just
gives you a visual countdown I guess
it's a smart looking smart clock would
you buy a smart clock he said no okay
speaking of which the microwave the
Alexa enabled microwave is actually the
best thing I think they kind of botched
some of the coolest things about it so
Amazon's amazonbasics microwave with
Alexa voice functionality will cost 60
bucks when released on November 14th so
originally I thought this is kind of
cool because a lot of people want to add
these assistants to the kitchen but it
always takes up more space like you're
gonna have like one of these tablets on
your kitchen countertop and I don't have
that I'm gonna interrupt you again wired
has been trying to link to these things
the whole way through I'm pretty sure
cuz they're trying to get affiliate
revenue but they links to the microwave
but it's not on Amazon yet so the you
click on the microwave and it tries to
like their automatic link identifier
thing tries to bring us to dot CA and it
just lists like some random black &amp;amp;
decker microwave which has like three
stars out of five I like people even
like that much it also costs 772 dollars
cuz there's only one used one for sale
and the pricing is just broken so I was
like okay I'll just you know what
they're automatic link thing you just
derped us I'm gonna switch that to comm
did that nope just a whole bunch more
random microwaves I thought this was all
like news links but no no it's just
affiliate links okay sounds good thanks
guys so you want an assist in your
kitchen
you usually have to add some extra
device on your counter space that sucks
so I don't know you can just buy a whole
new micro in your it's in your microwave
that's already taking up space sweet but
it turns out it's not actually
completely built into the microwave the
microwave just pairs driven with an echo
so it doesn't have mic microphones on
the microwave so you still have to have
your echo device within earshot or
something like that but it ok yeah no
that's what I was saying like the reason
I Google home can hear me even if I'm in
bed he dents in the living room because
my room doesn't have a door my house is
one room yeah sure yeah but the reason I
think this actually kind of works on a
microwave is for a few different reasons
number one you don't want to learn how
to do stuff on a microwave you don't
want to learn have you seen a microwave
you're like okay how do i how do you set
a timer on this thing I don't think
that's how ever happened how do you
there confuse number number number giant
green start button that's for the basic
stuff what are you doing a microwave
more advanced than that like defrosting
a fish and like there's tons of
different advanced crap that no one uses
and partly because you just don't want
to invest that much time into learning
how to use it instead you just the guy
put in for 30 seconds I'll check it so
this has presets so you can put
something in and the example they have
is hey assistant heat up my feet up once
one cup of coffee heat one cup of coffee
and it knows coffee please
it knows what the item is preheat to 400
degrees Alexa heck yeah you didn't want
to get up yeah yeah yeah some micro what
are you gonna do pre-heat your microwave
dude I'd be way more
within with an oven based versions yes
even even if you're not on the couch
even if you're just in the meal prep
stage if you're chopping something up
and you're like oh crap
switch to broil yeah boom yeah I'm sure
it's coming this is just this is number
one
do it up Amazon get her done oh yeah
it's time for our favorite sponsors
sponsors assemble half of you were gone
because of the anyways that doesn't
actually matter but we're gonna come
back to us as us now uh let's see yeah
that's not my twitter handle there first
one there we go
Sergey if you're an IT professional or a
power user I'm neither uh you're not a
power user you wouldn't classify
yourself a power user it's a spectrum if
you're an IT professional a power user
or just person who has two computers or
like a computer and a laptop which is
that's still at the same time that run
different operating systems or the same
one I don't know why this is necessarily
worded the way that it is you can
connect them together and share a mouse
and keyboard between the two my favorite
use case for this personally
is actually one that I've never done and
I've done the more hardcore one but
whatever is when you if you work with a
laptop at work that you bring home quite
a few people do this these days a lot of
workplaces just have docking stations
and you just bring your own laptop in
you can bring it home put it on some
type of like laptop arm or dock or
something like that and synergy will
automatically detect that it's there and
share your desktops mouse and keyboard
to that laptop so if there's stuff
you're working on you want to keep
working on it or there was something you
saw during the day or whatever whatever
whatever you could drag it from computer
to computer because it has that that
functionality just drag and drop from
one desktop to the other and it shares
your keyboard or mouse between the two
it's it's it's super super cool I went
off-script there let's note though it's
it's very cool
I've always liked this for me I had I
had to
Computers setup I don't even remember
why but if you go back and watch the
original mineral oil computer video back
when I was filming and editing videos
not in front of the camera I'm filming
Linus doing like a room walkthrough of
my room showing off my mineral oil
computer and there's two computers but
there's two keyboards and two mice yeah
and it was super late that's bush league
did ya know and I had like different
monitors set up for the different
computers and it was it was a nightmare
anyways you can you can check out
synergy and get signed up there at this

google's chinese search engine link
searches to phone numbers possibly
allegedly maybe Google is taking a
second crack at offering its search
engine in China we were pulled out of
mainland China in 2010 so it's been a
little while now after discovering a
phishing attack targeting human rights
activist this time to comply with the
Chinese government censorship
requirements google is reportedly
reportedly important operative word
right they're building a prototype
system that would tie Chinese users
Google searches to their personal phone
numbers Google hasn't which they
probably already kind of do so they
would just be giving that information to
China this time oops
Google hasn't confirmed the existence of
this project at all also extremely
important line right there its
previously said that it's only doing
exploratory work on a search service in
China and that it's not close to
launching a search product in the
country very specifically around 1,400
Google employees have allegedly signed a
letter demanding more information about
the project which reportedly runs in
partnership with a Chinese company
apparently five employees have left
because the project I have some
questions about this yeah first question
how many people are gonna use this given
that there's huge search incumbents
there notably Baidu who's gonna use
Google when you've got a like sign up
and get like it's not frictionless like
it is here you're not gonna be able go
to a new tab Google search before you
want you're gonna have to sign up that's
why I can put your that's when you're
gonna input your phone over but everyone
already did sign up for Baidu so right I
don't know how much of a footprint
they're gonna get there next question
this is a more of a statement I
that your phone number is tied to like
your official government ID there yeah
so that's why this for your I'm gonna
butcher this I don't remember what it's
called but you're like citizens standing
which is like a really deep topic that's
like a new thing though right new ish
yeah alright yeah that's its own thing
yeah that's very much its own
conversation and I'm not well-versed
enough in that at all you know what I am
well versed in the first uncensored
adult steam game which got banned in 28
countries after only coming out I'm so
sorry 14 but it was fast you know what
it's still available in the US Canada
and UK and that's a lot of the people
listening right now it is and now since
its banned we all get to talk about it
and I see what all the fuss is about and
there's a we've we've been yeah that's a
good boy yeah because the whole goal
we've been talking about this developing
steam conversation for quite a while now
I think this is the third or fourth time
it's come into the show where steam
banned a game and then there became the
whole topic of like well should they
actually be the gatekeepers to what
games get to be on the platform because
at a certain point you kind of stop like
when when you own so much of a space
people stop seeing you as a private
company and start seeing you as like an
essential service last yeah and it's not
actually what happens but people start
observing your company as that totally
it's like when target said that they
were gonna have Grand Theft Auto on
their shelves anymore it's like yeah
there's they thought that was some kind
of breach of human rights or something
it's like if I open James pizza shop and
I want to serve only ham and pineapple
yeah I'm allowed to do that it's my shot
we do you start to get kind of entitled
to be like no Walmart has to have
everything a completely comprehensive
selection if it doesn't then they're
just censoring and and there's some
validity there because consumers could
just go somewhere else right so they you
start being seen as an essential service
and then you kind of have to act that
way or else people will just bail or you
and then hope that you make it anyways
but Steve's approach was that will just
add filters and you could just not see
what you don't want to see and then
apparently countries are just gonna ban
games anyways so it doesn't really
matter
yeah so the official statement from
steam I believe is like they do not
endorse pornography or yeah erotica in
games the game still on the store yeah
but you're not gonna see it unless you
specifically still tell steam that you
want to see those things yeah and I'm
like 13 and I'm on Steam and I'm just
checking that box yeah
I am definitely 28 years old that's like
this flash game so Mike when you're a
kid
the internet was new they're like are
you at least 18 sure like what year were
you born scroll down to the 50s that's
definitely old enough dude I used to
troll and just make myself like a
thousand years old because sometimes
they were just in they just pull from
like a database of years right so they
don't even check input the year you're
like 1676 yeah I was born in the 1500
the game negligee loves cherries is the
first totally unsettle adult game on
Steam it's been banned in all sorts of
the usual suspect kind of countries like
Saudi Arabia and yeah that's not
surprising games been found a number of
countries for having uncensored naked
anime girls damn cartoon boobies yep
they might release future games with a
censored edition as the main release
with a free or cheap mature content
filter mature content release I don't
know what to call that the opposite of
filter mm-hmm unveiling yeah the
unveiling DLC here you go yar checks on
yeah way on I think they're a little bit
worried
RTX on our TX super on the switch is
broken just holding the leaver yeah
there's a quote here if they find or
targeted steam as part of our agreement
with steam we this is darker Studios we
would be liable for all the costs and
damages to steam which would end our
company and since we are a small indie
developer and do not have
resources for such costs while making
games that would be a bad thing and
that's that's why they're there
considering in the future just kind of
making it safe by default and then just
charging you a bit more having you to
opt-in yeah getting the dirty version
speaking of things getting banned in
different countries twitch has been
blocked in China you are trying to block
me switch has received an uptick in
Chinese leadership over the last few
months as audiences flushed to watch
eSports matches being played at the
Asian Games in Jakarta an event not
broadcasted on state-run media in China
last month twitch hit the number three
spot among free apps in China downloads
for the app of the week of August 27th
rose 23 times higher than the previous
week China performed well during the
event and brought back two gold medals
but now twitch has been blocked in China
with no official statement being
released by Chinese authorities because
they probably really don't care the
steady shutdown of access to twitch was
logged via social media in China in
China viewers in many provinces reported
that the site was suddenly unavailable
in their region while it was still up
elsewhere but the end of the week twitch
had been completely blocked yeah so the
way this works I think is that you kind
of obviously China they like to control
the activity that happens online so if
if something there's a lot of activity
on a website that kind of gets their
attention and so for example streaming
is really popular in China
but they've got strict rules some of
them are really weird like you are not
allowed to stream yourself eating a
banana because pornography is illegal in
China there became a trend of people
just doing non-pornographic erotic
things like eating bananas in a sexual
manner while streaming so then they just
said okay eating banana on a stream is
illegal so they have rules like this and
when suddenly a large portion of the
Chinese population so like a voluptuous
grapefruit
I'm sure you could push it down a banana
to plantain
it's girthier
there's another one you know I'm allowed
to wear something you know to wear like
I forget but it's silly
so that then that you get a foreign
website that gets a lot of traction
there's a lot of people watching streams
and they have no control of what happens
on those streams that the population
could be watching streamers who are
talking about topics that are not
friendly to the party and that's no good
so they just shut it down and if they
think it's a compelling offering that
the people are trying to should have in
their lives then they'll just get a
Chinese cop company to make a carbon
copy of it yeah and then they keep the
money in China someone in chat is like
putting me on blast because I'm not
using this opportunity to rep PIAA
that's gonna cost you a P is helpful we
might be in trouble in China there's a
bunch more tops but we could also be
sort of done yeah anyway you want to
talk about cuz there's a lot of topics
so is there any specifically well no
joke here's one that's ten seconds long
one plus is making TVs that's all we
know we don't know when know how much
they cost we can be reasonably sure
they're not gonna actually make panels
like LG yeah or or or what's the big
Chinese one that no one knows but it's
actually third oh the TTL C is it know
TCL they're not gonna be they're just
gonna buy panel from someone else and
then put a casing on it and make their
own on-screen display in and somehow
integrated with our phones I'm sure but
that's about all we know
yeah but that's cool they think
headphones good yeah I don't know
anything about this at all but it seems
cool Europe and Washington State bands
together to tackle the loot box problem
and it's a long topic it's cool though
because it just puts more pressure
hopefully absolutely will be no more
loot boxes at all but that gram that
doesn't make it freemium somehow they'll
find a way money we'll find a way
I hate loot boxes see ya my not again
honestly my my one of my biggest
problems of loot boxes
something that isn't being fought for
very much I hate that cosmetic items are
in it and a lot of people say that it's
fine but there's a lot of paid games
that have cosmetic items and loot boxes
and I think that is horrendous the old
Liga Legends model especially then it
wasn't even a loot box you just buy it
you buy the one you want which is why
that's so hard you just get the thing
you want but with loot boxes putting
cosmetic items in it it removes it we're
in my opinion it removes features from
the game and I think that's something
that people aren't really paying
attention to like if you look at destiny
destiny when it first came up I've heard
the new expansion is good whatever I
don't care I'm done with that game but
when destiny first came out there was
all this stuff to do but it was
extremely not rewarding and you would
hit like a cap really really quickly and
then the main things left to do in the
game in a lot of games once you hit the
end is to like make your character look
really cool and there was a lot of ways
to pay for that but there's so many
systems in the game where it would have
been really easy and absolutely would
have happened like ten years ago if
there was no loot boxes they would have
had maybe not all the cosmetic items but
a lot of the cosmetic items that were
there would be unlockable through doing
something in the game paid full price
for this game so having like additional
challenges like Oh beating the raid and
under a certain amount of time or
beating the raid with no deaths or it's
not whatever content the raid was
already there yeah it's just new
incentive to play it a different way
yeah and that's that's huge for me
personally I love weird challenge modes
I'll often like play a game on a not
very high difficulty but then make it so
that like oh I'm playing a shooter game
but I'm never self I don't allow myself
to use guns you have to use like like
like just a knife yeah I did that in the
chaos theory yeah I was only allowed to
stun the lights out like EMP them nope
well it's at all I missed out on all the
shotguns and snipers and all the cool
things in that game yeah but it makes it
really awesome experience and that's
something you can do and the game can
also incentivize those types of
situations and they often games often do
with cosmetic items or unlocks of some
sword-like if you remember smash back in
the day don't lock all the characters
you had to do some stuff what did you
have to do I don't even remember but you
had to do some stuff I feel like it
required an all-nighter it's like you
had to do something with every character
some crazy thing like that like you it
was it was kind of not a lot of games
used to have those types of systems and
those are really fun and now most of
those things I'm not saying the new
smash doesn't have this so I don't even
know if the last mash had that type of a
system I'm not trying to throw a smash
under the bus I just remember that was a
very legendary one being unlocked the
characters fairly core to the game a lot
of games used to have systems where if
you did something and an advanced level
or in a specific way you would unlock
something and most of those systems have
been removed in order to make it so you
pay for those things yeah that's weak
