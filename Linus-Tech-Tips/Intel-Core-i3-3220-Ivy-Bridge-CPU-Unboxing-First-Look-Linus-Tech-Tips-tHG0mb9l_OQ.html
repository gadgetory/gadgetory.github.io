Intel's Core i3 3220 so a core i3 3220 I
know Intel's part numbers can be a
little bit hard to decipher but the most
important thing in this part number is
that three right at the beginning
because that means this is a core i3 a
low-end processor that is based on their
third-generation Ivy Bridge architecture
now in the enthusiast space for the 35
70 K in the 3770k there have been some
complaints that the IGP
is our brother the IPC improvements so
how many how much performance per clock
we're getting compared to the previous
generation Sandy Bridge is offset by the
lower overall clock speeds that can be
achieved in overclocking however with
these lower end processors based on that
Intel's introducing them at equivalent
price points compared to the Sandy
Bridge I freeze and i5s that are being
replaced putting in better integrated
graphics which means faster video
transcoding and well better graphics if
you're actually running games off of the
GPU that's built into the CPU and the
fact that we're getting about a 10%
clock for clock performance increase I
think it's pretty much a no-brainer if
you're building a low-end machine you
want Intel Inside then you know don't go
with the last generation 2000 series go
with the new generation Ivy Bridge chips
because since there was no overclocking
on the previous generation I threes or
the new generation i3 s you just want
all the performance you can get out of
it and at stock speeds and stock
voltages they run extremely cool inside
the box you get the CPU itself which is
an LG 1155 CPU compatible with pretty
much every LGA 1155 chipset out there
that's modern so your z77 your b75 your
HH 78 Mitch whatever it is I'm gonna
okay LGA 1155 socket here slick is
helpfully handing us an LGA 1155 socket
motherboard which he is about to install
the CPU on so I'll say saving the
trouble we'll do a quick CPU
installation guide make sure you line up
the notches with the notches and then
carefully pull down the arm no we're not
doing that you'll have to do that and
then you would normally gain there's
bolts running through this motherboard
for an aftermarket cooler but you'd
normally use one of these which is also
included with the sticker and the three
year warranty and the box thank you for
