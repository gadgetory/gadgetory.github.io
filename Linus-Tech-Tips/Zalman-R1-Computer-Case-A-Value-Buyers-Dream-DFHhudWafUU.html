requests that I get from viewers are
usually terrible I mean we're talking
stuff no one could possibly care about
ancient products that have been reviewed
to death already products that simply
aren't available in my region of the
world blah blah blah list goes on but I
still love getting review requests
because without them I wouldn't happen
across little things like this one right
here I'm still mostly gonna pick stuff
myself like the long overdue rumba video
that I have upcoming but keep your
review requests coming anyway
save on select Intel 730 series SSDs
with instant rebates during presidents
week February 22nd to March 1st 2015
click now to learn more so you guys
often ask me for more affordable stuff
the Solomon r1 is definitely that is it
the cheapest case on the market no that
would be some homemade affair with
cardboard and packing tape something
that seems cool in theory and then
you're all like oh no there's no front
USB 3 which I guess leads us pretty well
into the tour of the outside of the r1
the top mounted i/o includes a power
switch two USB 2.0 ports a USB 3.0 port
audio jacks and a reset switch that's
actually not as susceptible to cat feet
as it looks since it needs to be pressed
in pretty far to activate also on the
top is a removable panel that covers one
of the three included 120 millimeter
fans and amount for another although
it's very unlikely you'd be able to fit
a radiator here due to the motherboard
clearance issues that you might run into
the front of the case features a brushed
finish and a stylized zelmans II with a
very stealthy seriously there's not
appear to be a handle door that opens up
to reveal the junkie estoy sampling
material I think I have ever seen
seriously there are round plastic
stickers applied to the magnets to help
the door stay closed so it won't
accidentally like stick too much and
like pull it off as far as I can tell
there's two five and a quarter inch bays
in here a three and a half inch external
day a to fan speed controller that
cleverly supports low high and off for
up to those two fans I just mentioned
and a removable cover that has fine
removable plastic mesh in place of a
normal filter that reveals another of
the three included 120 millimeter fans
this time with LED lighting as well as
another spot for an extra although much
like the Coolermaster Silencio that I
reviewed recently I fail to understand
where the front fans are going to draw
air in from there is a small gap between
the front door and the front bezel and
there are small mesh vents on the side
of the bezel but that's still going to
be very restrictive so I wouldn't
recommend putting your dual r9 290x
config in this case on the bottom of the
case are some taller than average feet
good for keeping your power supply with
its bottom mounted fan supplied with
fresh air and on the right is a bulged
outside panel to give you some room for
cable management because there's almost
none between the motherboard tray and
where the panel would normally be and
even then there is not a lot even with
the bulge on the left side is a tasteful
window that'll show you the CPU socket
area and graphics card and finally
around the back is the final included
120 millimeter fed on the only radiator
compatible fan mount in the case
external water cooling grommet 7 PCI
slots and a bottom mounted power supply
a slot so let's open this baby up
we'll start with drives there's a single
two and a half inch mount above the four
three and a half inch tool list mounts
it's nice that it only requires screws
on one side and keeps your SSD up high
enough that you won't have clearance
issues with the cables at the back so no
complaints here but the three and a half
inch mounts are frankly terrible the
left side plastic rail doesn't allow a
screw mount and the right side one
doesn't latch to the case like there's
no handle on it so to reiterate no hard
mount and one of the least secure
tallest tabs that i've ever seen do not
buy a pre-built system in this case
there is a good chance your drives will
slip out in shipping although it's less
of an issue if you're just buying the
bare case the only exceptional thing
about the tool is five and a quarter
inch cages is the lame-o cable
management holes nearby for the front
panel connectors everything but USB 3
fits through the one hole to be cable
managed at the back um but the USB 3 one
has to go through a separate one it's
not a huge deal or anything it just
feels a little bit short-sighted around
the back of the motherboard trade there
are lots of cable management holes that
are mostly actually pretty well
positioned one in the corner for the a
pin eps connector well-spaced ones on
the side of the motherboard and the
bottom near the power supply and only
one for the front panel audio
conspicuously absent and there are lots
of cable management loops with a CPU
cutout for easier cooler installation
back here as well
there are also some weird vent holes
back here that I feel like
probably should have been just left
solid the motherboard tray in this case
is quite flimsy as it is and punching
more holes and it just feels like
tickling the bear so to speak with that
said it feels fine once your motherboard
is in just make sure you run your 8 pin
power connector before mounting your
board or it will not fit through the
hole and also make sure your board is no
wider than standard ATX or it will
interfere with this bend in the tray
power supply mounting is pretty
bog-standard there's a filter on the
bottom of the case but unfortunately
it's kind of a pain to get it unless you
flip the case over but this support
brace that screws into the top and
bottom of the chassis and prevents sag
and up to too heavy expansion cards is
actually a really nice addition the
mechanism is fairly rudimentary just
kind of unscrew it where it is and then
screw it back in where you want it to be
but it really works with that set I
suspect part of the reason that it's
needed is that the metal used for the
rear of the case is quite thin so heavy
cards are much more likely to warp the
PCI slots and sag and while I'm
complaining about those really Zelman
one-time-use PCI covers
I hate those what if I change my card
loadout and I don't want to leave a
gaping hole in the back of my system but
I guess it's all kind of a you get what
you pay for thing the MSRP for this case
what told us enough to know that it
wasn't going to be you know super
amazingly built but it's certainly
functional and surprisingly good-looking
so for a single GPU gaming rig whoa
looks like not a bad choice and at the
prices that I've seen people on the line
of tech tips forum saying they've gotten
this case for on sale I'm willing to
forgive you know boneheaded stuff like
the pre-installed top 120 millimeter fan
that will literally exhaust no air in
the cases default config with the top
panel closed so I mean with the right
promo the r1 is a pretty killer value
for a windowed case with a black
interior a stylish looking front panel
and all of the other things that it's
got going for it so it wins my it might
be good but it really depends how much
you'll be paying for it
award speaking
of depending how much you're paying tank
on their pay only for what you need
approach to being a mobile carrier means
that all you've got to do is visit Linus
ENCOM and use the savings calculator to
get a twenty five dollar bill or device
credit and to find out if they're a
better deal for you and there's other
really cool stuff too like if you call
them you get to talk to a real human
being instead of an answering machine if
you've got a contract they'll pay 25% of
your cancellation fee up to seventy-five
bucks and they officially support gsm
devices like the iphone 6 and 6-plus now
so it's Linus king.com to let me know we
sent you and I think that's pretty much
it thank you for watching guys like this
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave a comment if your
feelings are more complicated than
either of those things as always there's
another link in the video description to
buy a cool t-shirt like this one give us
