brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries hey guys we're here at
the Indy mega booth with life goes on
and this game as far as I can tell is
about dying to progress is there any
more you can tell me about it sure yeah
well life goes on originally started as
a global Game Jam project in 2012 the
theme for the year was about the aura
Boris and that's a symbol of life death
and rebirth so what we wanted to do is
we really want to really want to create
a theme that fit with that so we figured
death and reincarnation was the perfect
idea so in what way does that actually
make sense we figured making a puzzle
game where your deaths are actually
meaningful and alter the state of the
game is something that we really wanted
to explore and that's something that we
were really interested in because
generally speaking death in games is
really bad you know it's a very common
trope it's been like that way since the
very beginning in really wanted to take
a look at it and see how we could do it
differently and show people that may be
innovating on traditional mechanics is a
very very good idea and it can actually
sell some great games yeah and it's cool
you took a like you said traditional
mechanic of death but then just
completely destroyed the idea of it
which is my favorite part because you
just murdered the classic idea of death
where you go back to a checkpoint and
you're like no to get to a checkpoint
you must die which is my favorite part
of the whole game I love the art style I
love the different elements that's all
awesome is there anything else you can
add about the game like is there any
little story elements or anything like
that sure well you know we have a night
and he's searching for a Grail because
isn't that one nights do the problem is
is that none of the Grails are really
the right one so they keep going through
to get through all these traps and
puzzles to find the right Grail you know
they just keep finding stuff that isn't
really right for them so they just keep
on going your Grails in another castle
something like that yeah yeah it sounds
like good want to say it but yeah
generally maybe we'll make a joke where
someone comes out and says your Grail is
in another castle I don't know if that's
going to take some localization though
so yeah that makes sense alright how can
people get this game sure well first off
we have the demo available for download
off our website we have on our website
it it's
available for PC Mac and Linux we also
just put it up on Steam this week
currently on steam it is pc only because
you know we were coming to pax things
got really busy and all that stuff so
what we after pax is over we're going to
throw up the mac in the linux build and
we're going to make sure people can play
it on those platforms as well we really
want to support all the platforms and
spread the gaming love and make sure
that it's not just pc users that are
getting all the great games now speaking
of different platforms and all that kind
of stuff you guys as far as I've heard
are a giant group of programmers that
you mad at Gamescom how do our games Jam
sorry how exactly did that work out
being all of you being programmers
alright well that was a bit interesting
when we were delegating roles you know
we were talking around and it's like
what can you do oh I have a programming
degree oh I have a programming degree in
engineering oh I'm doing my masters in
computing science oh I did a math degree
it's like all right well what can we do
with that so it's like okay well do you
have experience making any art yeah I
took like a course and we're like a
great your are artists they were like we
need a sound guy I'm like well I made
sound effects once they're like great
you're the sound guy you know and and
susan was like well really i'm just a
program we were like great you're now
the code monkey you're only going to be
programming for the rest of the project
so that's kind of how we delegated roles
eric is kind of our jack of all trades
so we just get him to do whatever we
need him to do and you know he's been
great he just goes and gets it done and
you know we need people like that
because we're you know we're four people
we're really small company you know
we're bootstrapping it ourselves and you
know everybody has to contribute in
every way so you know we all contribute
to design we all contribute to the
levels we give our feedback on the art
style you know it's not always what our
artist is looking for because he's like
hey give me some feedback when the guy
looks good ship it he's like no but what
about this and we're like yeah I guess
so but yeah so sometimes it can be a bit
frustrating when you're trying to get
feedback on very specific things but
other than that you know we we gotta
help out with everybody in every way we
can so that's awesome and one little
thing that they have here is as he was
saying he's done some sound effects work
so he is the sound effects guy instead
of just having his phone
boys dying in the game repeatedly he has
decided to allow other people have their
voices dying in the game repeatedly so
if you're here at PAX you can come down
to check out their yellow box and do
your own little death sound into it I
know I'm going to do one of mine and
then you can have your little part in
the game is there anything else you have
going on like that sure we also have a
mailing list signup sheet and if you
sign up for our mailing list all of our
nights have unique individual names so
if you sign up our mailing list you can
suggest a name that we get that we're
going to put in the game but the way our
names workers they're all randomly
generated so we picked bits and pieces
from every name in order to randomly
generate our names so when you come and
you can give us a name you're actually
giving us 20 or 30 different names based
on how many names we have so that's
that's I think that's pretty cool that's
really cool it's awesome that people can
contribute to the game that they might
like hey guys so I'm doing my death
sound animation right now so hopefully
the mic picks this up well my voice is a
little bit hoarse but I'm gonna go for
it anyways oh man hopefully that picked
up well I almost saw like I was going to
throw up but that works alright so if
you're here come down putting your email
shout into the box if you wanna if you
like life goes on if you want to see the
