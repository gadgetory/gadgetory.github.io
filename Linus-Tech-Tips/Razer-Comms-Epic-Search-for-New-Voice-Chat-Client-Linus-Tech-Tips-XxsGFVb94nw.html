youtuber for interacting with viewers
but it lacks that same personal touch
that you can get from a voice
conversation and so began our epic
search for the ultimate voice chat
client that would serve our needs both
from a gaming perspective as well as
allowing us to enable live voice callers
on the LAN show our weekly live stream
we looked at conventional gaming voice
chat clients such as mumble and Ventrilo
but what we realized is they don't
really have friends which makes us
kindred spirits I suppose but doesn't
really help us manage the live
interaction aspects of things it doesn't
give us that same degree of flexibility
they also mostly require hosting and
managing a server which if you've seen
the uptime of latest tech tips comm you
probably have some idea that we don't
want to do too much more of that they
can also take awhile for people to set
up which isn't really great for a
spontaneous live viewer call an
experience and having it be as seamless
as possible they also lack game overlay
functionality so if you were to use
these on an ongoing basis besides just
calling into the wine show then so then
we were like oh yeah Skype Skype skid
for voice calling but that was a total
mess you can have group chats but if the
leader leaves then the whole thing shuts
down the overlays are clickable which
means that particularly from a gaming
perspective yet that will kill you and
last but not least there's the fact that
on skype there's an exploit that allows
the other callers to get your IP which
even whether you're streaming in the
middle of streaming if someone starts
ddossing you or just for anyone in
general having people know your IP is an
undesirable condition so ya know enter
Razer calms the friendslist is easy to
manage and you may already even have a
Razer account so you can sign right in
and you're pretty much ready to go you
don't have to have a dedicated server
Razer hosts everything so you can avoid
having an awkward sort of totally not
recommended server running in your
bathroom overlays are helpful and not
death inducing and last but not least
chat rooms are permanent and coming and
going from them is a breeze it's so easy
you just think one-handed job so guys if
you want to check out Razer comms no
it's not going to make America skinny
again one slap at a time but what it
might do is simplify your gaming voice
chat experience and guys please use the
bitly link in the video description
below to try
our razor calms it'll help us out a
whole lot
as always guys don't forget to subscribe
