pretty old news by computer industry
standards but there are a couple of
things that make this combination
product more interesting than you might
expect number one is the incredible
value proposition for budget gaming and
number two is the unexpectedly high
performance of these entry-level CPUs
once you add a discrete graphics card
today's video was brought to you by
tunnel bayer tunnel bear thinks the
internet is better when everyone can
openly access the same content so
Tritonal bear for free at tunnel bear
comm /l TT
let's begin by jumping right into gaming
performance on rise and G's integrated
graphics where unsurprisingly its Vega
GPU stomped all over Intel's best
efforts to build a competitive on chip
graphics processor then fell short of
even a gtx 1050 TI putting it pretty far
down the pecking order compared to
discrete graphics cards so we tested at
1080p medium details but based on our
results it's more likely that you would
opt for 720p high or 1080p low though to
be clear we are not complaining about
this budget gamers would have given
their left nut for 720p high 12 years
ago when AMD first began work on the
combination cpu GPU paradigm moving on
to productivity we get very similar
results to the same clocked older
generation Rison chips with the new g
series actually pulling off some better
results in tests like multi-threaded
Cinebench and v rays cpu benchmark and
then leaving intel's onboard graphics
standing on the starting line in the GPU
version now we also saw similar or
better scores compared to old Rison in
asus reel bench ignoring the OpenCL
result since they obviously favor
discrete graphics cards and blender CPU
test continues the trend with team blue
getting smashed and the GPU test once
again showing us that 8 and 12 C s
respectively aren't ideal for heavy
lifting so what have we got here then
we've got a couple of really nice
upgrades the 2200 G obsoletes basically
the entire existing rise in three lineup
and remember you can just plug this into
any existing Rison compatible
motherboard with at most a BIOS update
and the 2400 G ends up being a toss-up
with the more expensive 1600 X so what
you get is onboard graphics and in some
cases better performance due to the 4 +
0
see xdesign and second-generation
precision boost but what you give up is
some level three cache and a couple of
course for heavy multi-threaded
workloads now these are budget products
so AMD costed down the IHS to a
traditional thermal paste this time
around though that shouldn't be a big
deal at this package power and Verizon
runs pretty cool anyway and while we've
never had great results with Rison
overclocking today's chips were
particularly unimpressive both of them
managed only 3.8 5 gigahertz on all
cores which is more than the precision
boost frequency of the 2200 g but
actually less than the 2400 g to be
clear that's on all cores so it's still
a net gain for some workloads and the
2400 g managed it at a lower voltage but
we just need to make sure that you're
going into your purchase here with
realistic expectations for a single
Benjamin and change thermals were a
little higher than usual for Rison
thanks to the higher default voltages
and probably the lesser thermal compound
but power consumption was basically
spot-on
only a few watts different than the same
clock to OG rise in CPUs our Intel chips
it should be noted managed lower idle
drop alright so let's talk upgrade path
now a lot of people go out and buy a CPU
like this with integrated graphics with
the intention of only using those
temporarily so what is gaming like once
you throw in a dedicated graphics card
actually fine so we ran our rise in CPUs
with a 1050 Ti in the earlier testing
and then re ran our G Series with it as
well and we got similar if slightly
lower results across the board so it
looks then like AMD's decision to split
the PCI Express Lanes between the
integrated Vega core and the PCIe 16x
slot giving only eight lanes for each
didn't actually hurt them too badly
so at 99 and 169 respectively the Rison
320 200 G and rise in 5 2400 G are both
better values than their predecessors
and integrated Vega graphics with some
help from native support for higher
speed 29 33 dual channel D our 4 memory
gives them much better performance and
maybe even more importantly
compatibility in GPU intensive tasks
than anything that Intel can muster so
Intel who opted not to seed us the price
competitive processors saying we'd have
to go buy them if we wanted to compare
gee I wonder why holds the performance
crown for CPU only tasks but as for
livingroom PC enthusiasts or budget
eSports gamers we all might have just
found your next processor and if you run
a small business on the side y'all might
have just found your next cloud-based
accounting solution BAM freshbooks is
the simple way to be more productive
more organized and to get paid faster

paid up to 4 days faster they've got
fully featured mobile apps so you can
track your hours track your expenses you
can do all this stuff with you on the go
and they've got a really cool feature
that allows you to see when your client
has seen your invoice for the first time
to put an end to the back and forth of
oh I didn't get it can use end it again
and yo you got it alright so just go to
