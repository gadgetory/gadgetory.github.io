part of a dying breed of laptops it
isn't thin it isn't light it doesn't
feature fancy materials like carbon
fiber or magnesium and wait what
no RGB but was the old formula really
that bad or did it just need to be
tweaked a little with its proudly
displayed VR ready sticker is a Zeus's
latest Strix laptop ready for the 2017
consumer let's find out
cooller masters 25th anniversary edition
cosmos 2 features a unique dual curved
tempered glass side panel check it out
now at the link below at just under an
inch the GL 502 vs is not exactly a thin
in light but that does seem to be the
standard thickness shared by most gaming
laptops these days and at 5.2 pounds it
is a whopping 1.4 pounds less than the
Alienware 15 putting it more comfortably
into the marginally portable category
the outer finish is a combination of
brushed aluminum like plastic and real
brushed aluminum that ends up looking
good while avoiding feeling cheap though
it does fall a bit short of feeling
premium there is some flexible and
trackpad and the screen and hinge are
solid but could be better
so in summary although the Strix doesn't
have quite the robust build quality of
the Alienware 15 for the same specs it
comes in at a whopping six hundred and
forty five dollars less so I'm sure some
folks will find themselves asking well
data I really need that magnesium I owe
is also strong with three USB Taipei's
and a high-speed USB type-c although
Thunderbolt 3 would have been really
nice here along with everything that
most people will need to keep a dongle
off their keychain for at least another
year the specs are highlighted by a quad
core Core i7 7700 HQ a powerful gtx 1070
graphics card and an nvme boot drive
that while small is fast so we should be
getting a pretty awesome gaming
experience out of this device assuming
it can keep all of that cool one pit
stain on this otherwise great laptop was
that out of the box thermals were awful
it does seem
to be an isolated issue with our machine
though and it was solved by reseeding
the cooler so we aren't sure if it was a
problem with a Seuss's thermal paste
application or perhaps a less than
gentle shipping company but at least we
know that it doesn't overheat by design
like some devices with that said under
synthetic loads on both CPU and GPU we
did see a little bit of thermal
throttling but under realistic loads
like gaming there was no adverse effect
on performance whatsoever which is good
because there is lots of performance in
this guy its gtx 1070 was able to smash
through the 60 FPS threshold in our
triple-a gaming benchmarks at very high
details at the screens native resolution
of 1920 by 1080 and what's really nice
is that when it does go over 60 FPS you
don't have to worry about those frames
getting wasted it runs it up to 120
Hertz with g-sync variable refresh rate
technology and thanks to a Seuss's
choice of an IPS panel it's not just a
delight to game on but it's good enough
for productivity too it's nice and
bright and although I wouldn't recommend
it for professional color sensitive work
it trounces the 120 Hertz TN display on
the Alienware 15 making doing anything
from watching youtube videos to writing
in word to video conferencing with
relatives just plain a better experience
and the keyboard is a contributing
factor it's one of my favorite things
about the Strix
it's scissor switches have a long travel
distance and excellent tactile feedback
for a notebook and perhaps equally
importantly this feel is consistent
across the whole deck the red
backlighting and tactile knobby on the W
key are also nice touches and unlike
some gaming oriented keyboards this is
one that I wouldn't mind using to write
up an essay to top off the usability
asus has
and kind enough to include a numpad
something that can no longer be taken
for granted on a 15-inch laptop so the
only minor gripe then is that it's a
little bit easy to accidentally open up
the rog gaming center when you're aiming
for the backspace now the enthusiasm
gets kicked in the head a little bit
because the trackpad I mean it's usable
but it's not nearly as amazing it's a
click pad but the force required at the
top is much higher than at the bottom
the way it's recessed into the chassis
makes two finger operation a little bit
less comfortable than necessary and it's
high input leg gives it kind of a
sluggish feel so forgetting a mouse on
the go is a little unfortunate but with
that said not nearly as bad as
forgetting your charger in fairness to a
soos this is about what we expect from a
high powered gaming laptop though noise
wise the Strix remains at a comfortable
volume while gaming and at no point got
close to being obnoxious and the
speakers while not the loudest that I've
heard on a laptop are surprisingly
punchy and remain clear at full volume
so although you wouldn't be using them
for your next house party they're more
than enough to throw on some tunes while
you're fixing up supper so then in
summary Strix is not a perfect laptop
but it gets what it needs to write and
it does so for a great price the
excellent screen and outstanding
keyboard make using the Strix a great
way to be productive IRL or in games so
the bottom line then is recommended
are you a small business owner or
freelancer would you rather spend your
time actually doing work instead of
fussing around with complicated
accounting software while FreshBooks is
built for you it's the simple way to be
more productive more organized and most
importantly get paid quickly you can
create and send professional-looking
invoices in less than 30 seconds you can
set up online payments with just a
couple clicks to get paid up to four
days faster you can accept deposits
through the
platform and you can accept payments
through the platform and this is the
biggest one for me you can even see when
your client has seen your invoice and
put an end to that back and forth yeah I
didn't get it can you send me another
one and then maybe I'll pay you in a
while no no no more of that so for an
