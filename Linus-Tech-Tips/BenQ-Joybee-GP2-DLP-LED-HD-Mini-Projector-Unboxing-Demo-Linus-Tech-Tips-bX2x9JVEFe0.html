the BenQ joy bgp - so the GP one was an
LED lit projector in a very small
form-factor meant to be portable the gp2
is now an HD LED lit projector so that
means you will never and you know never
is an asterisk because if you ran it
forever it might eventually run out but
you will never have to replace it the
bulb with an expensive replacement bulb
pretty cool this one also is HD now so
it's 720p
you've got multimedia connectivity which
I'll show you when we open it up an
iPhone / iPad dock and I've seen this in
action already very cool and you can
even get a detachable battery that will
run the unit for 2 hours on battery life
actually I believe the Ben Q sight
quotes 3 hours so somewhere in the 2 to
3 hour range not 100% sure which is
great for travel great for portability
let's see what else Ben Q has to say for
themselves on here so HD ready 2 watt
speaker so it does have included
speakers so it'll do audio over HDMI USB
reader SD card reader so you can play
from pretty much any source 2 gigs of
built-in memory so you can play from any
of those sources you can play from your
well it's not even on here but you can
play from the iPod dock it has a
document viewer it supports USB display
there's the brightness I've seen this
thing up to about 70 inches though with
no issues whatsoever very cool it has
Auto Keystone instant on-and-off LEDs
and it runs for 30,000 hours without
replacing the bulb so that is pretty
much in that sort of never timeframe
here's the unit itself which comes in a
great carrying case this time around
especially when compared to the GP one
we've got an included remote so I'm just
go ahead the flock bag here show you
guys the remote functionality that is
included with the GP 2 if I can there we
go ok so you can navigate the menus I'm
holding it upside down sorry guys you
can all look at that dedicated controls
for your iPhone or iPod and yeah that's
pretty much it
let's see what else is included
here we got the power adapter so small
power brick and there's even room inside
the case this this was one of the things
that BenQ received complaints about with
the GP one was that there wasn't room in
the carry travel case to put the power
adapter well now they have designed a
special compartment right next to the
projector for you to put that in there
and there you go
nice and compact we've also got doctor
cables included we've got composite
we've got iPhone and then we've got VGA
Nitze keen and finally a USB cable so
let's have a look at the unit itself
pull that out and take this off okay so
pretty glossy pretty shiny also got a
nice like anodized aluminum brushed
aluminum finish here with the BenQ logo
there's all of your navigation these are
all touch sensitive buttons including
the okay in the middle on the side we
find ventilation there's a heat sink
that you can clearly see through there
we've also got a focus wheel on this
side we see the lens itself but just got
a big old bat fingerprint on it but you
know nothing you can't take care of
there you go it's not much better okay
more heat sinks and a heat pipe even
hopefully you can see in there yeah okay
on this side we find the business end of
the unit so there is your USB so you can
run content off USB there's your mini B
there is your PC slash AV so oh I see
okay so that adaptor where'd that go
okay so this adapter allows you to run
VGA or composite and this what looked
like an iPhone adapter to me really
looks an awful lot like an iPhone
adapter to me plugs right into there and
gives you those options you've also got
mini HDMI so you can plug that right
into your tablet smartphone whatever the
case may be
audio in headphones or audio out very
cool because what that means is with the
HDMI you're not stuck with the 2 watt
speakers that are included you can also
plug them into outside external speakers
very neat
and DC power in here we have more
ventilation such a small unit as well as
oh what's this
aha SD card slot but such a small unit
ventilation is gonna be key because even
though we're using LEDs it's still a lot
of a lot of light that's being generated
a lot of heat that's going to be
generated there's where you plug in the
external battery pack and let's go ahead
and give me a couple minutes and I'll
get this set up so we can watch
something on it so this is fairly
straightforward I plugged my my iPhone
in it says press ok to connect so I
press ok iPod docks or searching pretty
bright and here you guys but hopefully
you can kind of see the point so here's
the size of the image camera man if you
just want to have a look at the blinds
we aren't able to get them any more
close than that so I would say in a
darker room actually here maybe I can
close them a little bit better oh there
we go okay so in a darker room that's
properly set up for a presentation you
can get a pretty darn good image out of
this guy that is here about this big
no no issues whatsoever very cool for
such a portable unit now I'm running SD
content now so let me find something HD
give me a sec here guys so right now I'm
using my favorite my favorite iPhone app
this is err video and I can play back
any video that is on my my Windows Home
Server at home let me just see here's
here's something HD just adjusting the
volume down here guys with the included
remote so yeah no big deal
I'm gonna go ahead put that there and
I've got something HD to playback for
you guys from the beginning okay
outputting through TV output so to speak
and there we go so that is running at
probably a down sample of 720p because
remember this is streaming from my home
computer all the way here but I just
want to give you guys some size
perspective for the image so kind of
here's me here I
five six apparently your arm span is
about the about your height so yeah it
looks like we've got about five foot
wide image here coming out of this
projector that looks pretty darn good
I'm very very impressed with how easy it
was to set up the gp2 I think for you
know what here I'm just gonna turn on
the the light I think for gamers that
are running out of there you know that
are still living in sort of one room and
they want a projector or they want a big
screen and they don't necessarily have
the means to buy like an mount you know
a big 50-inch TV or something like that
for five hundred five hundred and fifty
bucks this thing is a killer value to
set up a nice big screen on the cheap
and put it away in a very very small
form-factor whenever you don't want to
use it plus eliminating that that bulb
replacement factor is huge and awesome
very very cool big thanks to thank you
for providing this unit for us to check
out don't forget to subscribe to - tech
tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos so here I am set
up on a much larger wall although I'm
actually not projecting a much larger
image just yet let's go ahead see how
big we can get it this is a very
brightly lit room right now there are
lights directly above it so right now
the image is probably about who I'd say
five and a half six feet wide and I'm
just gonna level it off and I'm gonna go
ahead and I'm gonna turn the lights off
in here I'm just gonna head over to the
other side and turn off the light
and show you guys oh that looks so good
what kind of results we get with this is
HD content playing off camera man's
iPhone not my own and here we go I'm
just gonna something to do with some
Victoria Secret thing image quality and
color is just outstanding I'm gonna
change my angle a little bit here so
that I'm straight on and zoom in a
little bit so that the there we go so it
looks just awesome so once again thanks
to Ben Q for allowing us to check out
the gp2 don't forget to subscribe - tech
