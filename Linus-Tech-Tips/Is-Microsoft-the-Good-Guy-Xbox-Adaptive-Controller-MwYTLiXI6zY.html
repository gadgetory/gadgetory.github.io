such thing as normal so how do you
design something like a game controller
that's meant to offer the highest
performance possible to as many people
as possible do you just kind of take the
average well actually yeah that happens
pretty often but if you do that you're
naturally going to end up with a design
that a lot of people really like I'm
particularly fond of this one but that
others simply cannot use at all
thankfully Microsoft has given us
another option the Xbox adaptive
controller is not specifically designed
for anyone so that it can be used by
everyone
the thermaltake a 500 aluminum mid-tower
case features a minimalistic design
brushed aluminum panels for a clean
uninterrupted look hinged tempered glass
windows on both sides and compatibility
for radiators of up to 420 millimeters
at the front get it today at the link in
the video description
okay so here I am I've got my adaptive
controller and I'm connected to my Xbox
one
it's got wireless capabilities but it
also comes with a nine foot USB cable
that can plug into this USB type-c port
that is also used for charging so the
big d-pad here is for navigation and
then I also have the menu view and Xbox
buttons up here as usual but then like
other than that there's not really a lot
going on here I mean I've got these two
big black buttons here that are labeled
a and B which actually have like pretty
nice tactile feedback and click
reasonably consistently no matter where
you press them but like so what am I
expected to play with just two buttons
and a d-pad Tetris blades of Steel it's
like an S layout okay
okay cool so this is sort of usable I've
got my accelerator I've got my brake
I've got but there's some issues like
press white or rewind I don't have that
I can't press handbrake or like yeah
look behind me or or really much of
anything
so then odds are you'll want a few more
buttons than this luckily Microsoft has
given us a few options the easiest of
which is called copilot this actually
lets you use your adaptive controller
and a conventional Xbox controller
together as one player so for example if
you have more mobility on one side than
the other then you can use a mixed grip
or you can even have a friend operate
one controller while you operate the
other one okay so here we go then so
have the joystick so all skier yeah yes
I'm gonna do gas and braking so then
you'd be able to rewind if I was like yo
I wanna I want to see that again oh
that's pretty cool no no I got this I
got this I got you fast
yeah whatever screw these guys Oh
so that's actually pretty cool
but the real power of the adaptive
controller comes here each of these
three-and-a-half millimeter ports back
here corresponds to a button that you
would find on a conventional Xbox
controller and there are actually two
extra ones that are confusingly labeled
as X 1 and X 2 so you end up with the X
DX 1 DX 2 and the X Box let me tell you
no one needs that many X's but I don't
know it then again this was designed by
the same people what brung you Xbox Xbox
360 and Xbox one anyway
here's how it works if I want to be able
to press Y I just plug in another switch
like for example this one the adaptive
controller works seamlessly with most
input devices that have this
three-and-a-half millimeter connection
type and that's really important because
there is such a wide range of ability
within the gaming community and the
perfect setup for you might not be the
perfect setup for the next person cool
so let's take a look then through a
handful of the different switch types
that you could use to build your unique
set up so this one right here is kind of
your basic buddy button in gator green
so we've also got though this pillo
button this one's cool
so it's actually cushioned to make it
comfortable to press with your head or
with your cheek you can actually hear it
actuate there we've also got this guy
right here this is called a wobble
switch and you can activate it a couple
of different ways so you can swipe in
any of four directions or press it down
and this one right here is an ultra
light switch is actually designed to be
worn and you can see here it requires
very little force to actuate so if you
have it on the back of your finger or
something and you push to gain something
you would activate it quite easily then
there's the little candy corn proximity
sensor which can be activated without
even actually touching it just by
getting very very close finally this guy
right here is a foot pedal that's
actually typically marketed towards
transcribers but see I mentioned this
before it does work with our adaptive
controller because it uses exactly the
same connector okay
so I've got all my different options
here I guess I'm gonna start playing
some Mortal Kombat excel okay so if I
don't have any accessories at all all I
pretty much have is punch other more
different punch forward back jump and
Crouch which is clearly well I don't
haha but it's not gonna get me too far
I'm just sticking with the epitaph boom
okay so this is enough to beat an easy
computer player especially with you know
remapping these two buttons to the you
know to things you want to do the most
often but I can't even block so it's
obviously not ideal now let's kick it up
a notch starting with a foot pedal so I
want this on what why okay I've got this
plugs in but like people now where do I
even put it okay let's go with here and
this is crazy like I'm all of a sudden
realizing just how many buttons there
are on an Xbox controller like even if I
only give myself four buttons here the
adaptive controller is a hundred bucks
the foot pedal is 25 and the buddy
button is another $65 so we're at just
shy of $200 and we still haven't even a
mounted all of this stuff or be attached
enough buttons to issue even half of the
total number of commands fortunately
though we don't have to add one button
at a time so the adaptive controller
also has USB ports on both the left and
the right hand side so I could attach
something like this which is basically
like a an Xbox compatible we nunchuck
controller or get this you can also use
a device that you already have lying
around like this joystick which could
provide both directional movement and
check this out a whole whack ton of
buttons alright so we've kind of got all
the ingredients now but this is where
things get a little bit more complicated
than what I would consider to be ideal
so take the one-hand joystick for
instance here we go it's got some
shoulder buttons and when you click the
joystick you can actually switch layers
so that the shoulders have secondary
functions not bad for 20 bucks but how
do you remap it well instead of the
joystick appearing as its own object in
the accessories app you actually have to
program it through the adaptive
controller
so doing this requires knowing that when
you plug the joystick in the adaptive
controller assigned certain buttons to
it so these are x1 and x2
so changing these buttons then affects
the USB device but also any switches
that you plug into the x1 and x2 ports
over here due to that same limitation
that we discussed earlier then stay with
me here guys if you plug the joystick
into the other side it actually doesn't
get mapped to x1 and x2 it gets mapped
to view and menu now so it didn't take
us too long to figure this out through a
combination of checking the manual and
trial and error since there's only a
couple of buttons on this thing but then
hold on a minute what about my other
random joystick which has a bunch of
buttons oof all right so the first thing
to note is that the adaptive controller
only supports eight buttons per USB
device so step one is to identify which
of the more than eight buttons are even
being used then I guess what you'll have
to do is just hop into a game that
you're really familiar with grab a pen
and paper and then start to map out what
the eight buttons do when your joystick
is plugged into the left and then repeat
the whole process again when it's
plugged into the right also if you don't
like which eight buttons the adaptive
controller decided to utilize like for
example what if I only wanted to use
these buttons down here instead of these
ones up here well as far as I can tell
you just don't get a choice one other
word of caution - if you're using a
high-powered device like one of these
mouth mites you're going to need to make
sure that you plug your adaptive
controller into the wall so it has
enough juice both for itself and any
connected accessories now Microsoft
wants $20 for this adapter in their
store but they also helpfully clearly
labeled the
so you could just use any 5 volt 2 amp
adapter so in conclusion then there is
definitely some room to improve the user
friendliness of the adaptive controller
but honestly the main reason that we
made this video wasn't to do an in-depth
review of it necessarily but rather to
bring a little bit more attention to how
for all their flaws amazing it was that
Microsoft spent both the engineering
time and the money to make this thing in
spite of the hundred dollar price being
higher than a standard controller I can
pretty much guarantee you that Microsoft
is never going to break even on this
thing let alone turn a profit so the
only conclusion other than that ok the
cynical among you might assume they did
it just for the good PR but I'm not sure
if I buy that I think I think it's fair
to say that if nothing else someone or
someone's over there worked really hard
on this thing so that they could open up
new possibilities for many many Xbox and
PC gamers because the whole thing also
works with Windows who haven't always
had many good options no it's not
perfect and yes a fully kitted out set
up can end up with the same kind of
ludicrous price tag that many other
pieces of accessibility equipment suffer
from but this is still a giant leap in
the right direction and it's something
that we hope to see more of what can you
change with headphones other than the
sound quality how about the materials
using a piece of CNC carved walnut wood
the math drop may say 99 know are closed
headphones are definitely going to make
you stand out they utilize a 40
millimeter driver with a warm rich bassy
sound and included with the headphones
are detachable cables a 1/8 to quarter
inch plug adapter a woven nylon carrying
case and a one-year warranty so check it
