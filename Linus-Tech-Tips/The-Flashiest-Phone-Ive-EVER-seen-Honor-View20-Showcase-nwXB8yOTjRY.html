sponsored showcase of their new flagship
for 2019 the honor view 20 and this is a
really flashy phone both on the outside
and on the inside and with heat pipe
cooling let's get into it
first things first the screen and wow
that's a dynamic wallpaper if I ever saw
one anyway this is actually the first
all screen display with a hole punch
style selfie camera that we've had here
in our studio and you know what I've got
to say between the intrusiveness of a
giant knotch
and the more gimmicky solutions like
sliding phones that have a lot of
question marks still about their
reliability this ended up looking like a
far more reasonable compromise than I
initially thought
you've still got just about the entire
status bar to fill up with notifications
and meanwhile it has a self-reported
91.8% screen to body ratio another cool
thing is that honor is still treating it
like a notch so they're still giving you
the ability to hide it and putting in
virtual bezels when you're watching full
screen content in landscape mode
so bottom line until we start to get
camera under screen tech over the next
hopefully year or two this hole punch
style is only going to grow in
popularity and the way honor has done it
on the Vue 20 is pretty cool because
unlike punching a hole through all of
the layers of the display except for the
glass like Samsung does on there a eight
owner says that this front camera only
partially penetrates the screen which is
apparently an advantage since not only
does it make it a bit less of a weak
point where your screen is susceptible
to breaking but each layer that the
camera intersects with has the potential
to leak light onto the camera sensor not
a bright idea now the camera itself is
pretty small and unobtrusive it's four
and a half millimeters or a little under
three sixteenths of an inch for our
friends in the US and day and they were
able to get it this small using a
technique where the liquid crystals in
the LCDs neighboring pixels will allow
light to pass through to the 25
megapixel front camera now some of you
may have noticed that the view 20
already comes with a screen protector
applied to it's six point four inch 19.2
five by nine screen but it also comes
packaged with a basic flat
the case which is clear so you can show
off this crazy glass back now honor has
done flashy iridescent backings in the
past but this is the first time that
they've used nano optical lithography to
give it this really funky chevron
pattern I think it looks freaking
awesome
taking it off though the sides of the
phone are metal giving it a nice premium
feeling and then around the rest of it
you'll find a USB type-c a single down
firing speaker so no stereo sound
unfortunately but at least it's
positioned so that it won't get covered
by your hand in landscape mode it's got
dual nano Sims
with dual standby support and finally a
headphone jack nice wrapping up our tour
of the outside of the phone we've got
the rear cameras so the view 20 is one
of the first devices to use Sony's IMX
586 sensor which combines a big
half-inch see most with tiny 0.8
micrometer pixels to deliver a 48
megapixel camera that's got a ton of
zany features from 960 fps slow motion
video to AI clarity mode which takes a
bunch of pictures at once then uses all
of the information to make a brighter
more detailed composite - the ability to
slim a person in video in real time so
you can enhance your body to get the
perfect look anytime anywhere James can
we try this
here's shaping level 5
now all of these AI Focus Features are
of course enabled by the view 20s Chiron
980 processor which has two NP use or
neural processing units as well as an 8
core CPU and making its first commercial
appearance the Mallee G 76 GPU it also
comes with 6 or 8 gigs of 21 33
megahertz RAM and 128 or 256 gigs of
storage with each tier corresponding to
different color options the coolest
thing about this device though is what
honor calls the 9 which is a cooling
solution that was first showcased at the
honor Note 10 conference in China back
in December 2018 it's a nine layer
thermal design including things like a
copper alloy shield an s-shaped copper
heat pipe and a graphene heatsink and
it's not the only gamer focused feature
in the view 20 it also sports three
Wi-Fi antennas since the usual two
antennas on a handset can be susceptible
to being blocked by your hands when
you're gaming in landscape mode like you
think about it your hands are basically
made of water
RF does not like water so the extra
antenna is on the back of the phone over
by the volume button here where you're
less likely to cover it and the phone
will automatically switch between
antennas according to which one has the
strongest signal the aim here was to
deliver a more consistent gaming
experience and you should have lots of
time to gain that xp with the view 20s
4,000 milliamp hour battery it's pretty
generous actually like we've seen
batteries this size on gaming phones but
a lot of the time they end up being
quite thick and the mainstream stuff
like even the plus size tends to be
around the 3500 milliamp hour range so
that's pretty nice to see finally
Honor's purple USB cable means that this
phone supports super charging so the
phone is rated for a full charge in 90
minutes or 55 percent in 30 minutes so
thanks to honor for sponsoring this
