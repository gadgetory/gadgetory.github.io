sorry we ran quite late today we had a
number of complications as you may or
may not have noticed we've had some
changes in scenery over the last little
while we're slick and I were streaming
from my garage and then we were
streaming from my garage but a different
part of my garage because we had torn
apart the livestream set in order to
make room for our until build guide then
I think we went back to the usual
livestream spot but I actually am NOT a
hundred percent sure about this then we
were gone when we were in Taiwan and we
did no live stream and now I'm here
slick is not here he is on a plane right
now he's probably actually he's probably
landing sometime soon so I should just
be like hey why aren't you at work but
then he'll probably be like hey I go to
sleep and I'll be like what you have to
sleep you don't even sleep and then the
conversation will kind of go downhill
from there but but yeah so he's gonna be
home very very soon but he's not able to
join me this time and as you guys may or
may not have noticed we've got a bit of
a change of scenery here so I'm gonna
shift up a little bit this way nope I
want this way yeah this man okay I'm
still under the microphone so it should
still all be good but yeah we've got a
little bit of a change of scenery we are
at the new Linus tech tips HQ which I
did a tour of oh crap do I have I'm not
monitoring the stream or anything am i
let's see it's a call slick put him on
the stream so yeah we are in the new
linus media group digs which i showcased
in a giveaway video not that long ago so
if you've seen that then great if you
haven't seen that then you haven't seen
it maybe I'll do it maybe I'll do a
formal tour of it unless we have it set
up somewhat properly so this is where
we'll be filming all of our unboxings
from now on as well as all of our well
all of our other videos because quite
frankly I am so tired of having Linus
media group in my house taking over my
life you guys have no idea how much
space it takes up with all the computer
stuff all the cases all the workstations
I mean walk around your house and then
picture you have to have any
between four and five people with like
workstations set up and then you have to
have video sets and like try to figure
out where those would go and then
imagine you have a one-year-old baby who
gets into everything and cats that get
into everything rumble has been so
annoying since we moved the company to
to my house so he is he has been a very
very very challenging piece of work so
let's get into some topics here we're
gonna do a lot more QA than we usually
do because I don't have the sort of
gorgeous
you know towering presence of slick to
converse with me so I guess I'll have to
talk to you guys which is which is great
which is exactly what I wanted to do
right now so yeah moving right along
giveaways yes the meme contest so we had
a meme contest on the Linus tech tips
forum and the winners have been
announced however the original idea was
that we were giving away a copy of Mass
Effect 2 now what happened was that copy
of Mass Effect 2 accidentally got sort
of kicked in the head somewhere along
the line someone like someone yanked it
somehow or whatever else so we don't
have it anymore so what I did was I got
my hands on three never settle bundles
which means you're gonna get crisis 3.2
maury derp BioShock Infinite something
like that so you're gonna get a never
settle bundle can't remember exactly
which games are in it but they're good
don't worry they're part of never settle
and we picked three winners because I
was at Computex and someone handed me
three never settle coupons and they were
like hey here you go and I was like hey
I already have these games cousin Linus
so I have like lots of copies of these
games well no I have enough for me and I
have enough for slick and enough for
diesel so I've already I already had
three at some point so I was like oh
well this is great because now I have a
prize for the mean contest so I'm gonna
show you guys the winning memes slick
never got back to me so he got no votes
in terms of the winners so I picked the
winners so if you guys don't like it
then you can email I don't care at Linus
Media Group calm and we will take care
of that never know I'm just sorry I'm
just looking you guys in all seriousness
though these were the ones that maybe
they weren't the best quality or maybe
they weren't but I've
you know but they were the ones that
sort of tickled me the most so I decided
to go with these ones here we go
winner number one tech story love it
so puppet you are a winner in fact I
will PM you right now and tell you that
you are a winner thank you for playing
you win send me a message Congrats you
win the meme contest ping me back and
I'll give you your cool
pardon the typos puppet if you're
watching but there you go you won you
get a never settle bundle from AMD so
good job next up we have okay yep
Twitter's confusing me right now so next
up we have I'm gonna load this one up
before I actually navigate to it this
time I swear sometimes Google Docs I
don't know what to do with you if you
don't press enter after a link then it
isn't a link so that makes a gosh-darn
ton of sense so okay no not the old
forms one that one I actually didn't
like that much but these are this other
one is from hk6 this is from I believe
slicks first live stream or second live
stream this is from when he broke his
well they didn't break anything but he
hurt his shoulder quite badly in a bike
accident and I I don't know this just
this just made me laugh this picture is
very caption Abul and part of what I
liked about this one is that he actually
went to the trouble to dig up this
picture from one of the very early
livestream so either either he's one of
those people who sort of obsessively
screenshots anything that's amusing as
they go through life which is great or
he actually remembered this moment
somehow and anyway that made me laugh so
I'm gonna message hk6 right now let him
know that he's a big winner winner mean
contest good work
message me back I just want to make sure
that he's actually still active on the
forum or whatever else and that to get
your prize because otherwise we can save
the prize for someone
who's actually still active on the forum
because being active on the forum is
what winners do next up we've got this
one I mean this one I just this couldn't
not win so this is the Linus Media Group
return to the Jedi bang and I mean
honestly this one probably shouldn't
have won because there are clearly
people in this picture who are not
members of Linus Media Group Logan and I
think it's actually very debatable
whether or not my cat is actually a
member of Linus Media Group but the
thing that the thing that really made
this one work for me was the was the
diesel as Princess Leia because well
that's just totally inappropriate and I
love it so let's go ahead that's a young
man Matt we're gonna send young men Matt
his message congratulations you win the
meme contest and thank you everyone for
playing message me back for your prize
actually the the codes are at home so
that's why I can't just send them the
codes now but thank you everyone very
much for playing slick and I and
actually my wife actually all had a very
very good laugh at a lot of the pictures
in there some of them weren't
technically memes but for the most part
they were quite funny anyway so we've
had a big controversy actually you know
what let's do some Twitter Q&amp;amp;A just
because apparently okay oh okay yes yes
Sean I will be talking next gen console
I know we haven't had a live stream
since some of the early news started
coming in about Xbox one III has been
going on this week so that haha it's
this one comfortable I just figure it
out why my butt sore I have an SSD in my
pocket
it's like yeah that hurts so what's in
the other pocket let's play what's oh I
do have the game codes look at that oh I
can tell you what games they're Crysis 3
Tomb Raider BioShock Infinite and Devil
May Cry apparently I don't have Devil
May Cry so one of them might come
without the Devil May Cry so yeah there
you go you'llyou'll got it all make it
up to you somehow yes I will be talking
next-gen console in fact some of my
opinions might be a little bit unpopular
and a little bit against the grain of
what most people think about the whole
Xbox one ps4
sort of head to head right now but stay
tuned for that close the blinds behind
you the bottom is light in the top is
dark it's driving me crazy Joshua just
for you
i'ma leave those blinds exactly the way
they are does b-roll have twitter yes
b-roll does have Twitter vo rolls
Twitter is Bureau underscore the intern
or something like that if you tell if
you look I follow b-roll on Twitter so
you should be able to you should be able
to find that there I got my dad a
Seagate wireless plus for his birthday
and he loves it I think you mean Seagate
because Samsung doesn't have a wireless
plus I love my wireless plus to mine
actually died on our trip to Computex
unfortunately though so I'm gonna have
to RMA that it's not accepting a charge
anymore so these things happen yeah not
a true nerd when you carry an SSD in
your back pocket yes I know just in case
you have to it's like you never know so
it's some another joke from that the
ultimate tech backpack video that we
made apparently none of them were
technically memes no I'm pretty sure
some of them were but I don't think any
of the winners were hi Linus now you
have a new office with spare room you
could charge lik rent to stay there um
yeah I could if I wanted to do that I
mean you know I don't know that we want
to share any space with slick and I we
will be renting out the basement suite
however I will not be posting an ad on
Craigslist because it was a huge
disaster when I posted and AD trying to
sell my motorcycle on Craigslist because
a bunch of you Yahoo's got a hand got
your hands on my phone number which in
retrospect I should have used someone
sent me a fantastic app they sent it to
me on my phone because they had my phone
number now where you can get like
burnable phone numbers it costs a couple
bucks or something like that and that is
what I recommend using for craigslist
ads now but i it's okay though because
as of today my bike is officially back
on the road i decided i don't really
care about a for came on I mean looking
at how much 4k monitors are coming down
in price already a soos has their new 4k
monitor which is based on the same panel
tech as Sharps
I mean it's using an XO panel so - I
wonder where they're going to niggas old
panel from so it's using the same
Sharp's monitor it looks fantastic I saw
that CER Computex which I'm like was
really tempting but I'm looking at how
much 4k is dropping already in terms of
price not touching it until it probably
gets closer to around a thousand or
fifteen hundred dollars and that's
that's when that's when I'll drop some
money on it so what that means is I no
longer have to make a deal of my wife
where I sell my bike to get a 4k monitor
so Mike's going back on the road also
part of the reason I had decided against
the bike was I was planning to keep
Linus Media Group running out of my
house
for a longer period of time maybe a year
or two so if I don't have anywhere to
commute to and I don't really have a
life because I have a baby and I run my
own business I figured I didn't really
need the bike because I didn't have to
go anywhere but now if I'm gonna be
commuting to our new office then I will
I will need i'm you'll need the bike
needed so what you do and I switch to
iOS 7 probably not I think I'm kind of
done with iOS 7 I guess I could the
thing for me is that like I don't I
don't know if this is the case with
everyone but I actually use my phone for
actual work and the inconvenience factor
that comes about when switching phones
and platforms all the time is I has been
a big problem for me during the AI
Swift's so yeah I I don't know I was
using my I was using my iPhone 4 while I
was over at Computex just because I had
to carry two phones my my HTC One is
unlocked so I was able to use that for
my Taiwan sim so I got a SIM card while
I was over there so I could get
unlimited data it's like 30 bucks it
costs nothing it's awesome it's just
like a pay-as-you-go unlimited data
unlimited text and like three hundred
and fifty minutes of calling ups who
uses their phone this much but then I
did because it was unlimited it's
awesome and then I was also carrying my
iPhone 4 because I put my Belson in
there so that in the event that someone
who doesn't pay any attention did text
me while I was over there I would
actually get the messages so I was using
the iPhone again for a little bit yeah
it's not that bad
for someone who's a light phone user
like me it's
very functional but I'm not expecting
ios7 to run very well on the iPhone 4
and I'm certainly not spending money on
an iPhone 5 or an iPhone 5s or something
like that so I really just doubt it's
gonna happen what changes are you
planning for your new pad
I am definitely planning to have some
storage space which is great because I
don't really have that at my place
I am definitely planning to make some
regular sets for things like unboxing I
know you guys kind of like the
randomness some of you do some of you
don't where sometimes we're unboxing in
the middle of a field and sometimes
we're on a rooftop and sometimes we're
just sort of in all these places but it
would be great for the sake of
consistency to have it in one place
because then we don't have to fight with
the lighting every time and fight with
the audio setup every time and we won't
have so many errors in them so so that's
something that that we really need to do
I also need somewhere where we can film
fast as possible much more quickly we're
working on ways that we can smooth out
fast as possible a fair bit and one of
the ways that we're gonna do that I know
you guys don't like things being
scripted but the reality of it is for
something like fast as possible where
efficiency is of utmost importance
compared to an unboxing where we won't
really be using this except for for them
where we won't really be using this
except like if we have some random like
specs or something that I can put on
there like if I can't remember exactly
how many stream processors the Radeon HD
GTX whatever the heck it happens to be
has it'll be great to be able to put a
couple notes on there for me but for
something like fast as possible where we
have to condense the information as much
as we possibly can using something like
a teleprompter is fantastic so this is
our new teleprompter we spent like 750
bucks on it so no wonder I have no money
right and what this will do is it'll
save us an immense amount of time and
it'll allow us to tighten up fast as
possible to the point where it really
will be as fast as possible so we have
an upcoming video coming up on the tech
quickie channel which if you're not
subscribed to already go subscribe check
quickie it's going to be decimal vs.
binary as fast as possible and the video
is only about two minutes and change
long which is really cool because I
think we
truly adequately covered that difference
between megabytes and MIDI bytes and
terabytes and tittie bytes and we didn't
really go into the very fine details but
we gave I hope the viewer a solid
understanding of why this discrepancy
exists in about two minutes which we
wouldn't be able to do without scripting
it so there you go that's one of the
changes we're planning I definitely need
like a cool game or den so when we're
doing things like after-party or our
gaming streams I want to have like a
couch and you know like a TV and maybe I
don't know maybe a console or something
put a computer in it we'll put a
computer next to the TV there okay but
if we ever did destroy I decide to
stream some console games I do own both
an Xbox 360 and a ps3 I don't even know
I was trying to I was trying to turn the
Xbox 360 on the other day and I was
trying to figure out if like there was a
power switch on the back or if there was
like some kind of a trick to it I mean
it turned out that there was a light
switch that controlled that particular
power outlet so it wasn't actually my
fault but I legit couldn't figure out
how to turn it on guys really do know
how to do this beer all because he's
more of a console guy than me anyway why
a CRT monitor I am not using a CRT
monitor guys it is a trick of the light
see there you go
LCD monitor okay is definitely a trick I
have a CRT monitor but that's only for
game streams because the input leg
drives me crazy on LCDs when i'm trying
to play platformers so let's go ahead
and turn off my phone because that is
going to be a real problem actually it's
been less of an issue lately because
I've just been systematically blocking
every single person where I don't
recognize their number when they call me
so yeah it was only a few Yahoo's who
caused problems someone asks if I'm
still associated with NCIX at all yeah I
still I still do work oops I still do
work for them so I still and I'm still
the host of NCIX tech tips at least a
lot of the videos that are on there I
don't know if you guys notice but we
actually made some exclusive Computex
coverage videos for NCIX so we reserved
a few of the really cool booths like
Intel AMD and Microsoft for the NCIS
tech tips channel so that was part of
their sponsorship deal that had them
helping send us over there so I don't I
don't have a paycheck from NCIX anymore
but we're still we still work together
on things I still have a lot of friends
there you know I still highly encourage
you guys to buy your computer hardware
there it's not like the way that we
parted ways was in any way negative or
anything like that so that I still fully
support everything they're doing and
they do the same for me so no it's it's
really really good you don't have to you
don't have to you know work somewhere
nine-to-five in order to have a good
relationship with them so all right now
this highly controversial topic him and
I just want to take some time to explain
this I posted a thread in the forum
asking should we post the booth babe
video so Linus Media Group did create a
video of the booth babes at Computex
2013 it was honestly it was the last
thing we did it was by popular demand
and we had some viewers be upset that we
were going to publish this and so I
posted a poll and I basically said look
unless an overwhelming majority of the
forum users want this video I don't
think it makes sense because you know it
it's one of those it's one of those
things where some people will feel very
offended by it whereas others feel very
offended that anyone thinks it's a big
deal at all but at the end of the day
it's a very polarizing issue so it
seemed to me that the safest thing to do
was that unless like literally everyone
was okay with it I was just gonna leave
it and then the other thing that I did
was I read through every single post in
that thread all eleven pages of it 19
pages of it lots of pages all 19 pages
of it and I looked at what people's
arguments were and to me the strongest
argument was not sexist in this or or
Texas and that or whatever else because
quite frankly I'm not an expert on any
of that stuff the part that really stuck
out to me was that this is a tech
channel we've never really done that
before I mean if we wanted to we could
replace - in fact if you guys wanted to
you could watch videos on CM HD or
there's at least
a couple of other tech channels I've
seen in the past that do news and they
do product videos where it's a busty
chick and she doesn't necessarily know
anything about the product which happens
to be the case with most of the booth
babes that we encountered while we were
there but the reality of it is you guys
are subscribed to me and I'm not that
attractive but that's what we do we do
the tech well not the tech the tech is
Logan's thing but we we cover the
technology we talk about the technology
we aren't attractive at least I'm not
attractive my understanding is slick is
very attractive so we cover the
technology and we've never really we've
never really gone down that path before
so why why are we doing this and I
thought it was a very good point
however I've had a lot of people say
look Linus come on you're not going to
show it to us at all
so I'm gonna I'm gonna give you guys
some highlights from it here in the live
stream if you so are so inclined
otherwise guys to note for a couple
minutes and we will be back shortly so
here I'm just gonna I'm gonna have to go
find it because I don't know 100% sure
where it is anymore
here it is Computex 2013 so I'm gonna go
ahead I'm gonna grab that screen capture
I'm actually starting to really like
xsplit I was having trouble with it
before and now it's now I'm a big fan
now it just kind of works for me so
there you go guys
okay so play Oh a PlayStation add you
guys don't have to oh let me know on the
twitch chat if the audio is okay I have
no idea after YouTube audio
all right something yeah I know right I
hope I get money for that ad even though
I'm the one watching it so Computex
coverage so so basically I just had
slick and b-roll run around at the show
I mean there's nothing gratuitous about
it by any stretch of the imagination so
there's the QNAP girls
okay well b-roll got a little bit into
that one
they're waving I forget where she's from
I forget where they're from say
something
can't remember that pcs I have no idea I
actually wasn't with them when when they
did this whole thing so basically that's
ass Rock can't remember who that is but
they just kind of walked around the show
got some got some videos people saying
hi holding products this guy's awesome
this guy's a rock star we actually did a
we did like like a Wow
yeah b-roll about coming into him too so
we actually did like like a mukbang of
his like Superman PC thing someone's
like good yeah twitch chats like go back
to Superman go back to Superman this was
the WD booth WD I know for a fact
actually imported her from like Russia
because apparently it's hard to find
blondes in Taiwan she was awesome she
actually made me a balloon animal which
is pretty cool I think that I think that
the definition of babes got stretched a
little bit with Superman and the the
Joker's here but there you go guys
so like I said there was nothing there
was nothing sort of like you know crazy
scandalous about it by any stretch of
the imagination but at the end of the
day if if it's gonna upset any of the
viewers it's probably not worth it and
like I said we've never really gone down
that path before and I think that
there's room for us to have include you
know the booth attractions so to speak
everything about it whether it's a
motherboard with water getting poured on
it or whether it's you know an
attractive young man or attractive young
lady holding a product then there's room
for us to include
that is part of the booth coverage but
it's just not really something we've
done in the past so maybe we integrate
it later on down the road you know at
the next event or whatever else the case
may be so let's see how upset Twitter is
at me now that I've gone ahead and I've
apparently I've apparently shown the no
one seems to care so there you go guys
it's one of those things where sometimes
there just isn't really a clear right
answer but now I've compromised and that
is all we are going to do okay this is
fantastic
so I've had people tweeting me all day
telling me this scandalous shocker of a
news story - did you hear about this
the Xbox one demos at e3 we're running
on PCs really really you mean the
hardware of the Xbox one wasn't done
before they had to develop games for it
oh no but - you don't understand they're
running on high-end pcs with Nvidia
graphics cards and I go really
you mean an x86 platform is being
emulated by an x86 platform and a
DirectX 11 graphics solution is being
emulated by a DirectX 11 graphics
solution Wow and you mean hold on hold
on
so you mean we need a little bit of over
we need a little bit of like extra
Hardware muscle in order to simulate
something else that actually isn't
finished check are you serious about all
this come on guys it happens every time
I'm gonna you know I haven't done it yet
but I'm gonna Google it now I'm gonna
see if I can gonna see if I can find
this because I'm pretty sure I've seen
this before ps3 demo running on PC
something like that let's see if we can
find a really old news story 2013 ya
know none of this is none of this is old
enough ps3 pre-launch demo running on PC
not 2009 none of this is old enough but
guys come on we go through this every
time yes the dead cats are pcs the
reason for that is that the hardware is
not finalized for the consoles yet
I mean look at how closely Microsoft and
Sony are keeping these things to their
chests Sony announced the console
without even showing us what it looks
like ok Microsoft announced the console
showed us the console
nobody had leaked it yet the fact that
nobody has leaked it means that very few
people were actually hands-on with it I
mean you look at something like video
cards every video card launch there's
always a leak I can tell you guys now
that I'm one of the top ones on the list
in North America to get any new Nvidia
graphics card and we are finally hooked
up at AMD my 7990 arrived so expect some
videos to be coming from that about that
once the once the team arrives back from
Korea so really excited about that
anyway I I find about about I find out
about new graphics cards from leaks
online not from Nvidia telling me about
it
so the kinds of people like the kind of
small circle of people that know about
something before it's generally sort of
rumored and out there yeah nobody had
seen an Xbox one basically until
Microsoft announced it outside of like a
select few probably within Microsoft
like it wouldn't even surprise me if
like below the VP or director level even
at major partners like EA nobody even
knew it was going to be called xbox one
or anything like that so so there you go
guys
finally accepted - is hotter than tasty
PC I really think that is open for a
debate mister the victim on the twitch
chat I really don't think that that
happens to be the case at all but anyway
there you go guys that is my sort of
take on it if anything we should be less
surprised than usual that the demos are
running on PCs because this generation
of consoles is more like pcs than
anything we've ever seen the floor I
mean back when it was a PowerPC cores
and cell processor
yeah it was a little surprising that
demos are running on PCs now when you
come on they are pcs yeah I will be
floored if we don't have Xbox one
emulators and ps4 emulators very quickly
this time around compared to previous
generations just because they're so
similar
uh all right so let's move on to the
next topic here I actually had to do all
my prep for this last night and I relied
very heavily on the forum for this so
guys you rock everyone who posts in the
new section on the forum you guys all
rock and don't if I didn't pick one of
your topics then please don't take it
the wrong way but these are the ones I
picked so Horvath 93 thank you very much
for this topic and indeed stepping up
their game so part of AMD's big
announcement at e3 this year was nada
blah blah blah marketing speak today we
are proud to announce that battlefield 4
will be exclusively optimized for AMD
Radeon GPUs with that said expect Nvidia
to have like a patch within like a week
they always do it's not like EA is gonna
ignore Nvidia because you know they
optimized a game for AMD and I see a lot
of sort of I see a lot of this stuff
where people are like oh like this why
did you benchmark that game within video
versus AMD it's an Nvidia game or it's
named you can buy like a couple of weeks
after launch Nvidia and AMD of both
pretty much optimized for it at that
point with a few notable exceptions
things like Crysis 2 and that crossfire
button that was a big issue for a long
time these are sort of the weird
exceptions that exist but those are very
unusual so let's go back to this and him
optimize for AMD Radeon GPUs and the a
series ap use and AMD FX CPUs EA and
dice have collaborated to ensure it
frostbite 3 based titles like the f4
look and run their best on AMD Hardware
etc etc etc we have also partnered with
Square Enix to exclusively optimize
thief's for AMD radeon gpus and AMD FX
cpus so this to me actually the coolest
thing about all of this has nothing to
do with the Radeon side of the business
because optimising games for GPUs before
launch is common sense AMD and NVIDIA
both worked really hard with game devs
to make sure that the games are going to
run correctly on their hardware on day
zero the part that really excited me
about that was this optimized for ap use
and optimized for FX CPUs what does that
mean
because optimized for CPU totally means
nothing optimized for a CPU means it
like is optimized for x86 which is Intel
or AMD it makes pretty much no
difference
unless there's some kind of an
instruction set like back when sse2 was
introduced that gets a major benefit
from something that they've implemented
in the game unless there's something
like that then yeah no it's not a thing
but optimizing for AP or FX could mean
that because the next-gen consoles are
so PC like in their architecture because
they're going to be using multi-core and
the AP use we could be looking at
optimization for multi-core in a way
that we've never seen before because
even though the last generation consoles
used three core and however many cell
processors PS we had who cares because
it was so difficult for dads to code for
that it liked it like the power of it
was so difficult to harness that's why
ps3 games looked so much better
throughout the lifecycle of the console
not because it was getting more powerful
but just cuz they were like wrapping
their brains around how the hell do we
put a game on this thing but these
next-gen consoles running x86 processors
multi-core processors we could finally
be looking at a situation where we are
fully leveraging our pcs which is very
cool and I'm extremely excited about
because things like the lack of
environmental physics have been driving
me crazy for years why isn't this
working why isn't this so immersive and
such a core part of gameplay yet and the
answer was because consoles were holding
us back not the case anymore
now they're gonna be running such a
similar architecture so we could be
seeing OpenCL or multi-core
optimizations for games that are going
to allow us to have all kinds of much
cooler AI and weather effects and
physics simulations and all that really
really exciting stuff and that to me is
the exciting thing about that
announcement on the AMD gaming Facebook
page so there you go that's my take on
that and I'm gonna segue into one of the
other topics AHA there it is and this
was posted by that denied bit uh sure
whatever John quiz equator sure fine and
that is Nvidia saying Xbox one and
PlayStation 4 our great news for gaming
PC's because a lot of people out there
are sort of running around saying
oh well Nvidia doesn't have anything
positive to look at about these upcoming
consoles they're both AMD AMD are after
all three of them are running AMD
graphics hardware and all three of them
well not all three of them Wii U is they
not great in terms of graphics
performance but the other two are going
to be very competitive with an entry
level gaming PC so I mean is Nvidia not
gonna be selling as many graphics cards
on the desktop the answer is no the
answer is this is awesome and the way
that Nvidia explains that I think is
very clear and the funny I mean the
funny thing to me about this article
it's actually an article that was linked
from the verge and I kind of went oh
mainstream media you guys are so funny
because I really don't think there's
anyone in the IT space you know whether
it's whether it's a Tom's Hardware
whether it's a you know you know reviews
by Jeff comm the largest and the
smallest I don't think there's anyone in
the actual PC space that could have seen
more powerful consoles as anything but a
positive thing but the verge felt the
need to report on this and this is an
videos fancy little graph that goes here
let's zoom in blue blue blue new
consoles raise the bar and this is
important because raising the bar
between the best performance that's
available on a PC and the performance
that's available on consoles I mean look
at how they've diverged with PC is
becoming so much more powerful over time
raising the bar means that we can
implement new technologies in the games
with the assumption that a large part of
the install base is going to be able to
use them I mean this is this is the only
way to get around companies like
Blizzard that make every game as if
every computer on the planet needs to be
able to run it whereas now instead of
and before we treated consoles like
computers so there's this huge install
base of people had to be able to run
this game and while you can go okay well
the PC version you can have
anti-aliasing you can have higher
resolutions you can have better texture
packs and all these things at the end of
the day you couldn't program like the
most sophisticated AI in the world
because it
gonna make the consoles chug and you
can't have like pcai and console AI
because then you're doing two completely
different development paths for the same
freaking game which is going to destroy
the overhead involved in what are
already Multi multi bazillion-dollar
undertakings particularly for these
triple-a titles so this is sort of
invidious thing as check this out back
when we had gtx 680 as the cream of a
crop and it was up against ps3 and xbox
360 we were looking at a thirteen point
two percent difference which meant that
anything any game release that had to
run cross-platform had to be crippled
because nothing will run optimally on
this when it has to run optimally on
this - I mean we're talking at 10x
difference plus in terms of performance
whereas now nvidia is saying well check
this out now between gtx titan which by
the way is a thousand dollar graphics
card and ps4 which by the way is only a
399 console more on that later now we
have only a two and a half times
difference so we'll be able to they'll
be able to make a game that's awesome
and runs great on ps4 but runs even
better on PC and you get that extra eye
candy in those tweaks there but we're
not being like like held down by this
like horrible horrible machine that's
just not even close anymore which is
extremely exciting so I'm gonna go back
to Twitter Q&amp;amp;A for a little bit here
guys
and if you want to talk to me then I
guess you can do that I'm actually kind
of kind of super excited about something
that I'm talking to someone about but
we're thinking of maybe finding away and
I don't know how it's gonna work we
might have to have some special tweaks
to the software or whatever else I have
no idea how we're gonna do this but I'd
love to find a way to open up foam
boards so that you guys can actually
call in and talk on the livestream and
there's gonna be some more overhead
involved for us we'll probably have to
have like what radio showed you chose do
where there's an operator that that
actually takes the calls and screens
them before they go live and we'll we'll
figure out sort of how to make that work
or I can just take over and I can do a
segment while slick screens the next
caller or whatever else we'll figure out
a way to make it work but I'd love to
have you guys interact live through
boys rather than limiting it to just
text interaction so I'm really excited
about that I had a I had a conversation
with the guys there on my way here today
and then we're gonna have a follow up
call Monday and I think that's gonna be
really cool so let me know if you're
excited about that as well guys cuz it's
gonna be awesome
someone asks best desk the one with legs
that's the right height I really like
the vert desk that's that adjustable
desk but it's like $900 or something
like that so it may be out of reach for
some people but I mean honestly you're
asking the wrong person about furniture
you guys are gonna be supervised okay
the table I'm using right now is some
horrible IKEA thing that's like the
worst thing I've ever seen in my life
one of the legs is legit broken off it's
propped under it and then I put the
table on it and then it's just like held
in place by like the pressure of the
table and then this is my chair right
now like yeah that that is legitimately
what I'm sitting on for the livestream I
have no furniture here yet
so don't ask me will a.m. do you make a
GPU to battle with Titan they might not
make a single GPU card but they
certainly have the Radeon 79
is positioned against Titan in terms of
price point Andy really has to get their
their frame reading fixed driver going
but it should be sometime later this
summer or early fall and 7990 is a
legitimate competitor at that point yeah
not in terms of power consumption you
know probably not in terms of heat
output or patent yeah okay well not I
mean the thing about Titan
and the thing about GPUs you guys is
that it's funny because consumers seem
to think that when it AMD releases
something Nvidia like quickly engineers
a solution and like combats it no no no
I mean Titan 7970 these cards are in
development for two three years before
they actually make it to market so it's
not like if AMD strategy which hat it
has been since 3000 series
if Andy strategy is let's build smaller
GPUs and address the high end with a
dual GPU solution so you look at that's
how it's been 38 70 x2 4870 x2 59 70
and 69 90 and I can't remember they keep
changing the numbering schemes like why
but that's been their strategy so how
are they going to counter Invidia having
a huge single GPU card well they don't
they don't have one so whether or not
they decide to do that in the next
couple of generations we'll have to see
but it'll be a couple years before we
find out if Fame D's gonna fundamentally
change their strategy which by the way
has been working pretty well for them as
someone who was on the retail side not
that long ago there have been times in
the last few years where like it's been
rough for the red team and now is not
one of those times so there you go
I don't know how much of that is I don't
know how much of that is never settle
and how much of that is the hardware the
better drivers but it's been it's been
very solid do you think you'll be able
to overclock a ps4 or Xbox one I doubt
it
the time on your pick is still synched
with China time yeah yeah probably I
can't keep track of which of my clocks
are right and which of them are wrong at
this point right angle 24 pin power
connector any thoughts it's non-standard
so it'll be great for some cases and not
so good for other ones slick is on a
plane y know cat tips ah it's it's hard
to prioritize making videos about the
cat's one quite honestly not that many
people watch them and it's not that easy
like it it feels like I am for a while
there I was like oh let's try and do a
cat video every day I mean there videos
of cats it can't be that hard
the reality that is it is that hard
because even though they do something
interesting every day it's very
difficult to catch it have you ever
tried to give a cat a command ruble does
that thing you were just doing did I Wow
so I'd end up with a lot of videos of
Rumble being like wow and that's it
that's all I'd have so it's very very
difficult apparently okay okay okay okay
tech fanatic says you feature two of my
news stories before and you forgot to
mention my name so they're consider this
I mention of your name you're awesome
too ah can we get an update on my PC
it's done it's just a matter of making a
video about it I just need like little
finishing pieces for around the outside
of the window and slits PC is nothing
special right now I've been ragging on
him to put
GTX 670 that I intentionally I
purposefully obtained a water block for
him for it and he never actually put in
his computer well it's better in video
or AMD Intel or AMD I actually have
videos about this I'm gonna do you the
I'm gonna do your big favor here and I'm
gonna Google them for you so actually
I'm not going to Google them for you I'm
gonna youtube search which is even
better so check this out because I have
covered these topics Intel versus AMD
I'm willing to bet BAM
first hit Intel versus AMD five hundred
eighty-six thousand people watched that
video
AMD vs. Nvidia BAM first hit two hundred
and fifty six thousand people have found
that video so you should to go ahead and
check it out the answer if you don't
want to watch those videos is that there
is no answer can you explain why the
comments are disabled in slicks keyboard
incident video the reason for that is
that we're not it's not open for
discussion there was a lot of support
from the community about saying that oh
well you know Armageddon is wrong you
know I trust Linus and slick their video
was right the original video was
probably right Armageddon is probably
twisting their arms to make this video
know we were wrong so it's actually very
very detrimental to have the community
siding with us on this when the point of
what we're trying to do is explain that
we were wrong apologize for being wrong
and undo any damage that might have been
done to Armageddon's reputation because
we were wrong so that is why comments
are disabled because it would be
extremely unhelpful right now for me
personally to have people talking about
in the comments how Armageddon was
unfair and did listen to that it is a
very serious problem what we did where
we misrepresented the facts so it is
very important that people just watch
the video listen to what we're saying it
is the truth and then just let's try to
have this all go away we'll be more
diligent in the future we owe it to you
guys we owe it to the manufacturers to
make sure that we are as accurately as
possible representing the facts but it
is not open for discussion anymore it's
done ah so that's why there are no
comments on that one do I have any
official do I have any original thoughts
on Microsoft's response to people who
don't have an Internet
connection I don't think there's really
much room for an original thought on it
there's only really one thought
seriously Microsoft really I mean even
the way that I I look at almost any
other solution I mean valve is of course
the golden standard actually this I
think this is one of my news topics but
I guess I'll just get into it now valve
is the golden standard in terms of
treating customers correctly sort of
they have done things that have been
extremely unpopular in the past as well
know used games people did not like that
at first that was a big problem big
controversy back in the day having to
check in having to sign-in I mean when
valve was pushing Steam always-on
internet connections broadband
connections were not as big of a thing
as they are now this is a big point of
contention between gamers and valve with
people vowing I will never install steam
I will never give a penny of my money to
this company whereas now we look at
steam as like you know God's gift to
gamers and personally I love it not
having to keep track of CDs I don't
remember the last time I installed a
game off the CD it's ridiculous like it
just seems like absurd now and going
back to the console concept for me of
installing games off of a disk is just
kind of backwards it's like well can I
just download it and have it tied to my
account like to me it's not that crazy
but problem with Microsoft's approach
right now
is how often it needs to check in that
to me is is a big concern because even
steam will run for a pretty reasonable
period of time in single-player games
without logging in even things like
Adobe Creative Cloud so Linus media
group rather than investing in
individual licenses of Adobe products
has recently switched over to Creative
Cloud so it's their subscription-based
service where much like office 365 we
don't have to worry about updates we
don't have to worry about having
out-of-date software we don't have to
worry about paying a massive chunk of
money upfront to acquire the software
and we don't have to worry obviously
about you know the illegality of
pirating software when you're doing
professional work with it so we got
Creative Cloud and it's also
creative cloud works without checking in
for at least a couple days I know
because I tried it I had it on a laptop
that's why I had B rolls Creative Cloud
logged in to my laptop so we could
install it there so he could use it and
then he was using it on the plane and
then in Taiwan without logging in
without validating or going online in
any way for at least a couple days which
is which is great I mean I'm never
really away from internet long enough
that a two or three days or five days is
going to be a problem but having it
single day is I mean I really hope they
backpedal on this I think there's a lot
of room for Microsoft to undo the damage
that they've done over the last little
while by just going you know what we
hear you and we're sorry and here are
the concessions we're gonna make the
living room is still very important to
us and they're right the living room is
extremely important Sony don't imagine
for as okay I'm gonna be getting into
one of my other topics so why don't we
just blah blah blah blah no okay this
isn't quite one of my other topics okay
so don't imagine for a second Sony
doesn't want to own the living room too
if you can okay here I mean using ps3 as
a streamer per video hello owning the
living room I mean they're they're both
moving towards that content consumption
as well as gaming model don't imagine
for a second that just because Microsoft
is the one talking about it doesn't mean
that they aren't both doing it also
don't imagine for a second that somehow
Sony is a white knight in all of this
they are taking advantage of some major
PR blunders on Microsoft side and yes I
have been one too I mean if you guys saw
my tweets during the Xbox one reveal I
was ripping on it as hard as anyone but
at the end of the day Sony's sitting
there going oh well this is great
because what Microsoft's doing right now
is they are paving the way for us to do
the same thing look at what's going on
with their online services so how upset
were people initially when Microsoft
wanted you to have a gold membership in
order to play games online over time
they got used to it they accepted it I
think I've gotten away from the living
room thing and I've gotten into that
other topic that I was looking at just
there but only in the living room yeah I
don't imagine they don't want to do it
okay whatever I'm just gonna 10gen talk
here because that's apparently what's
going on now so okay so look at paying
for the online service Sony kind of took
the high road and went well we don't
charge for ours blah blah blah blah blah
blah that's great well hey next-gen
guess what they're charging and their
charge is gonna be very similar to what
Microsoft implemented so if you think
for a second that anything that
Microsoft's doing right now if it turns
out that it works and gamers accept it
if you think for a second Sony isn't
gonna implement it whether it's sometime
during the lifecycle of the ps4 or
sometime later you are wrong you're a
hundred percent wrong because they will
that's the way that it duopoly works and
quite frankly Nintendo is so far out of
the game at this point and so far behind
on online that it's they're completely
irrelevant in the context of this
conversation Sony will follow suit they
will do check-ins they will limit used
game sales but they might do it with PS
5 it's just a matter of time and at the
end of the day there's nothing
inherently wrong to me with tying a game
to an account to a person as opposed to
tying it to a physical piece of medium
or in the case of what Nintendo did on
the original Wii with the classic are
classic console and all that stuff where
they tied it to the actual piece of
hardware I mean that was ludicrous and
that didn't get nearly the same negative
buzz that Microsoft's getting over what
they're doing with the one so mostly to
me it looks like Microsoft is trying to
do too much too fast
they are upsetting their core audience
which happens to be gamers sort of
they're very vocal audience happens to
be gamers but there are people who will
buy Xbox is who aren't gamers so they're
upsetting they're very vocal audience
and they are giving Sony so much ammo I
mean the Sony video was I mean it was it
was opportunistic because it ignores the
advantages of of account-based of
account-based title ownership so I'm
gonna play it here just because it's
it's in one of the
Red's on the forum at least I thought it
was here anyway so Sona created a cute
little video showing you how to share a
game on the PlayStation which was
basically just one guy handing a game to
another one and I mean that's that's
cute but it hold on I think I think I
clicked the wrong thing or maybe I put
the wrong link in there or something
like that I mean that that's that's cute
and all that but at the end of the day
yeah Sony wants your money just as bad
as Microsoft does and an interesting
point that was made whether it was by a
Microsoft employee or whether it wasn't
was that what tying the license to the
person does much like the way guys
remember we accept this from valve much
like the way Steam does not allowing you
sales I mean they don't allow it at all
never mind having a fee for it and
allowing you to do it they don't allow
it at all what it does is it allows more
money to go to the game dev potentially
and less money to be subsidizing like
additional licenses down the road like
why are we giving Game Stop money for
this and at the end of the day okay hold
on the argument could be made well Xbox
one games are probably gonna be $59.99
I'll be surprised if triple-a titles
hold at $59.99 or even $69.99 over the
near future because you look at how much
they cost to make look at how much money
is being hemorrhaged by companies like
Square Enix look at how few developers
are even left in the game and I'll be
floored I mean you look at gamers are
willing to pay $99.99 plus for something
like a limited edition you know halo 18
or whatever grew up to now in terms of
the Halo series that comes with you know
a plastic MasterChef helmet or whatever
the case may be they're willing to pay
it they've been testing the water on
this for a long time expected
games are gonna go up in price and if we
can prevent that by preventing used
sales I don't know maybe I'm okay with
that
I don't know I mean the reality of it is
I haven't bought a console game since
Mario Kart Wii and then I hadn't bought
a console game before that since Super
Nintendo maybe I'm just the wrong person
to talk to you about all this but I love
Steam I love the way the marketplace
works there I love the way that
pricing is dictated by maintaining a
solid run rate for the game death so
games end up actually priced like what
they're worth as opposed to you know the
packaging involved and the printing of
the discs and the marketing materials
inside and the logistics of shipping
them all over the place and covering the
margins for the retailers as far as I'm
concerned by by retailers we don't need
you anymore this is this is software now
but by I mean even the cost of the
bandwidth of downloading the game is
going to as long as they pass the
savings along to the consumer is gonna
cover what you would have spent giving a
retailer or markup and paying for the
logistics of shipping these stupid
things all over the place so I think
that it just has to move on from the
model it is now Microsoft's gonna be
very unpopular for a little while but at
the end of the day they're both going to
do it and if you imagine for a second
that Sony doesn't want to figure out a
way to have you buying Sony movies
through the ps4 then you're crazy I mean
look at what they did with even what was
that stupid console no one cared about
the little one not the Vita the one
before that where they wanted you to buy
like little discs that you were gonna
watch movies on I mean come on I've been
trying to do that for generations of
products now they're not the hero here
so there you go there's my unpopular
opinion on what's going on with the
whole console thing right now rate
pricing wise 399 versus $4.99 if
Microsoft can pull off Xbox one being
this motion enabled way of interacting
with your entire living room that's
really cool that's probably worth $100
to me I'm gonna let that sink in for a
minute
blah blah blah privacy this privacy that
as long as the privacy agreement is such
that in my butt's covered in terms of if
I'm sitting there picking my nose there
isn't gonna be a video of it on YouTube
somewhere as long as the bases are
covered on that and it's just accepting
my gesture inputs or whatever else and I
know that they have a patent for how
many people are watching the content and
whatever else and I'm okay you know I'm
gonna actually I'm gonna launch into
that after this as well the patent for
charging for content based on how many
people are viewing it that could be
awesome or it could be terrible so hold
on if they can make that work that's
going to be incredible it's going to be
a completely new way of it I mean look
at how hard the TV guys are trying to
push this with Samsung Smart TV with
their Jessica it doesn't
work at all the one platform that has a
chance of doing this is Xbox one right
now and the reason for that is it
actually has the horsepower to back it
up it's got the 1080p camera it's got
it's got the horses it can actually do
it
it has Microsoft behind it for better or
for worse yeah Microsoft isn't perfect
but at the end of the day I'll trust
their software more than I'll trust you
know Jack's utility unless it's been
around for 10 years like something like
FileZilla where you know that it's gonna
kind of work and it's fairly simple I
mean an operating system is phenomenally
complex the fact that they are able to
do it at all is outstanding so if
there's someone who can pull it off
Microsoft can pull it off and it is a
cool way to interact with your TV in
your living room change a channel volume
up volume down walking away and having
things pause I mean if you could set it
up I think imagine this for a second
guys if you could set it up so that you
can figure things in your Xbox one so
that when you personally walk away it
pauses and when anyone else does it
doesn't bother to pause I would do that
I don't care if my movie pauses if
someone else goes away that's awesome
I mean yeah there's problems with it
like if I say hold on I can't remember
what it is can't even I can't even
remember anymore
what is it well I can't even remember
how you turn off an Xbox with voicemail
but I think it's like Xbox off or
something like that I mean if I say that
and it turns off your live stream right
now that's that's that's that's bad but
they're gonna figure it out they're
gonna find a way to like voice can't
sell the content that's actually coming
out of the Xbox or noise cancel it or
something like that they will figure it
out and I'm pretty excited for what they
can do I mean the problem being that
Xbox one isn't as powerful it's not
gonna have as much raw power as ps4 in
terms of running games but at the end of
the day it's not like it's a generation
behind we're not talking about the
difference between the ps4 is gonna run
at 1080p Xbox one's gonna run at 720p
and it's gonna be a night and day
difference we're gonna be talking about
some extra details on ps4 it will look
better but neither of them are gonna be
anywhere near our PC anyway so whatever
it's all still console stuff so rap what
was that thing I wanted to launch into
it was something to do with it was
something to do with Kinect Oh oh shoot
okay if anyone in the twitch chat can
tell me what the thing I said I was
gonna talk about was ah come on guys
okay something something something
spying yes yes how many people are
watching okay so your initial reaction
to this is shock and awe and horror
right imagine if the content companies
were charging you for how long you sat
in front and watched it or for how many
people you had watching it now for
things like pay-per-view this is gonna
change the whole paradigm for you where
you have 20 buddies come over you get a
pizza you have one pay-per-view and you
watch it and that is going to be a real
bummer but for some types of content
this could be a huge blessing and think
about it this way guys it's one of those
things where you have accepted this
already okay hold on going to a movie
well you pay for how many people go and
you pay for how many people watch the
movie oh okay so you accepted that
before
whereas now all of a sudden I'm going to
tell you you're gonna have to pay for
how many people watch it in your living
room
and you kind of go whoa hold on hold on
a minute now assuming that the rates are
better depending on how few people watch
it this could be awesome if it kind of
starts at $19.99 to watch the movie or
whatever Netflix charges whatever what
their monthly service or if it starts
that what we're used to paying now to
have one person watch it and everyone
else is an incremental charge that's a
big problem but if we're looking at a
situation where if it's just me watching
it I can pay like two bucks and watch a
movie that could be awesome for the
foreveralone types that could be
fantastic
for people with big families it could be
negative so I think what we have to do
with the technology like that is we have
to go well hold on okay let's find out
where they're going with this because
remember guys at the end of the day if
for whatever reason you are unhappy with
the way that Xbox one implements any of
these patents or any of these
technologies you don't have to buy one
no one has a gun to your head no one is
telling you buy an Xbox one or I'm gonna
pop you because they're not allowed to
do that yet but that's the way to vote
anyone who is upset and we said this on
the last live stream anyone who is upset
about the way that Xbox one is unfolding
or ps4 for that matter if they decide to
implement some of these policies or you
know all of them are none of them
whatever it is you don't have to buy it
just don't buy it if you don't buy it
it'll all go away
all these problems will go away
instantly if nobody if not a single
person ran out and paid 1999 or $24.99
for a blu-ray movie that would go away
the pricing would job that's how it
works
I worked in a retail you have to move
product if you don't sell anything you
go out of business so don't buy it and
it'll go away and if you do buy it then
you're part of the problem ah so hold on
a second you pay extra in a theater to
cover the cost of the theater facilities
well you pay extra to consume content
because of the cost of producing the
content I mean as someone who makes
content now I personally benefit more
the more people watch it because I get
to deliver more ad impressions
well okay now hold on a minute what if
someone like some kind of a video
streaming service what if they didn't
even charge more for the content what if
they just got to count more ad
impressions if more people were sitting
and watching it that's cool because that
doesn't pass any cost on to the consumer
and it benefits the producers of the
content and it benefits advertisers
because they have a much better gauge
for how many people are watching their
content not everything is tinfoil hat
conspiracy theory and like I said
Microsoft may implement this in such a
way that it costs you $60 to sit and
watch a movie with your you know 18
children they might I don't know and if
they do don't buy it and if they don't
and if it ends up being something that's
very benign and benefits everyone like
the scenario I just gave you well then
it's a completely different story then
all of a sudden everyone's going to be
clapping their hands going Wow Microsoft
I can't believe you thought of this this
is the best thing ever because now our
Clinton I mean okay imagine this whoa
okay here's a brain explosion imagine
your pay-per-view was cheaper the more
people watched it because they could
deliver more ads or something like that
or you could have an option where you
could go oh I'm gonna have 30 people
here we're gonna validate it with
connect so we want the pay-per-view
stream for free and feel free to chunk
in ads here here and here what if you
had options for how to pay for your
content well so there you go guys
might be good might be bad probably bad
but I'm giving them the benefit of the
doubt because I'm not gonna pay for it
anyway all right so let's move on to you
know what let's do some Twitter Q&amp;amp;A
because I think I said I was gonna do
something that I never actually did it's
um I have no idea what time it is I have
no idea if my wife's gonna come get me I
have no idea how any of this is gonna
work tonight apparently I have a missed
call
hopefully it's not from her currently I
have Skype message from one of the mods
on the forum not sure not sure he wants
okay I can mention that so apparently in
the coding section of the Linus tech
tips forum there is a little coding
contest so the first so it's a hundred
line program
you want to do something so it's called
the under 100 line challenge so guys if
you're a programmer go check it out that
might be might be fun for you if you're
into that sort of thing okay so someone
says hide your friends behind a shroud
and watching movies well okay maybe I
mean it's it's one of those things where
if you get caught it might be a problem
much the same way as like well go in the
go in the HOV Lane or go in the diamond
lane or whatever they call it in your
area just put a dummy in the other seat
like that people got in trouble for that
and I am going to be talking about this
that that is a big problem that is like
a bla that that's like I can't even okay
ah why should you pay more just because
more people are in your house well
because more people are watching the
content it's not so much why should you
pay more it's why should the content
creator get more I feel like the more
people watch my livestream the more
advertising revenue I should get am I
wrong so it's it's not always about
consumer rights necessarily sometimes
it's about content creator rights or
sometimes it's about someone else's
rights and if there is a way that
Microsoft can do this in a benign way I
don't want to I don't want to keep going
on this topic for much longer but if
there's a way that Microsoft can do this
in a benign way that benefits everyone
then it's fantastic but if not then then
its problem and you don't have to buy it
there you go
- come on how would someone ever be able
to check in your private home how many
use there it's bsns ever gonna happen
with the Kinect they have a patent for
this read the news Linus are you going
to talk about the new Nvidia Wicklow
display driver killing cards haven't
encountered it yet I might not go out of
my way to install it this is this is
actually something that's interesting to
me about GeForce experience with
automatic driver updates and that's why
I personally I'm gonna opt out of the
automatic Driver updates because
sometimes updated drivers can cause
problems particularly with very old
titles and since I haven't played a new
game in like notes sometimes the games
that I do play tend to be older titles
so it's beneficial for Joe wants to play
the latest Call of Duty and beneficial
honestly for probably 95% of gamers out
there even more than that but personally
I probably won't implement it because I
do like to take a bit of a wait-and-see
on the latest drivers I don't know that
there's any of the
to it it's possible that it is killing
cards it's possible that it's not I know
there have been situations in the past
where there was a driver update that was
causing the fans to not go fast enough
which was causing cards that were
probably already on the brink of failure
to fail prematurely but I have no idea
what's going on with this one what do I
think about the new Mac Pro that's
actually one of the topics I have lined
up for later I haven't looked into it
enough so I'm going to be taking a very
sort of thousand foot view of it but
sort of give me give me some time on
that
why is gesture control so amazing if you
walk away at positives really people are
too lazy to press a button on a remote
it's not about people being too lazy or
too not lazy I mean you know the same
thing got said about cell phones what
people - you know blah blah blah they
can just you know use a phone in their
house yeah every advancement there are
fuddy-duddies who don't want to see it
so whatever it's gonna happen everything
in Star Trek will happen at some point
so you can fight it all you want right
and whatever ah Sony has been king when
it comes to proprietary devices like
flash on their cameras and their
specialist T cars are together
yeah actually sony has been one of the
worst in terms of consumer friendliness
with their hardware I mean as someone
who has a Sony camera that I am looking
at right now the mean they want money
for the firmware update to unlock the 4k
functionality that there was no sort of
they didn't say it was gonna be paid
when I bought my camera they want money
for the module that they didn't really
say anything about they said it would
just be an SDI output they want money
for the recorder that uses a proprietary
card format I mean guys don't pretend
Sony is your friend Sony's not your
friend Microsoft's not your friend
Google's not your friend
Apple's not your friend they're not your
friends so there you go I'm not your
friend for that matter unless you're
watching my live stream in which case
I'm definitely your friend of course
they'll try and sell movies considering
their focus on 4k players and blu-ray
yeah of course they're gonna try and
sell movies they want your living room
just like Microsoft we don't complain
about steam because the games are
cheaper especially with steam sales well
I'll be interested to see what happens
with Xbox one if they do bring us
cheaper games then we could be having a
very different conversation
steam has awesome sales no one does out
of console games stay tuned
yeah but with steam there was never any
expectation of buying and selling used
games of course there was PC gamers
expected it whether they delivered it or
not and I mean in much the same way that
steam told you up front you can't sell
this used I was still surprised when I
found out I couldn't give a game to a
friend and gamers who buy things upfront
on an Xbox one and know that they can't
tell it used or whatever else they'll
know that too or they'll be surprised
just like me have you got a call from
Nintendo about your life play no I
haven't gotten a call from them they
just they claimed one of one of the
videos they monetized it whatever I mean
we're talking on the order of like
several dollars like it doesn't make a
big difference to me one way or the
other but I was just amused because we
talked about that and then they they
monetized our video did you see his face
when Xbox said the cost no idea are you
talking about okay
AMD 5 gigahertz CPU yeah I'll be that's
actually one of my topics as well I have
a lot of topics till the time is it none
of my clocks are right I have no idea
what's going on right now do you think I
should get a 660ti or a 770 or wait for
760 sorry I can't really comment on
unreleased product so though I can tell
you right now that I will know at some
point would a gtx 770 do a 4k display
guess it wouldn't it probably yeah a
four gig one would be better though hi
from Red Deer hello what are the sexy
red boxes behind me oh well these are
unboxings I'll be doing soon this my
friends is a Xonar Phoebus which I'm
extremely excited to check out we're
going to be using this for our 900 d
ultimate build with liquid cooling this
my friends is a rampage for gene which
we were supposed to do a build with a
couple months ago but it got delayed and
shipping and blah blah blah blah so
we'll be doing a tiny an ATX build with
that one that's gonna be really cool
because it's gonna have a six core it's
gonna be in a silverstone sgo 9 so it's
gonna be super tiny it's gonna have a
Quadro and a gtx card so it'll have cuda
acceleration for DaVinci Resolve this is
going to be Diesel's numeric station so
CUDA acceleration for that and it'll
have eight Peter tended or whatever the
high bit color depth output is for his
pro art 8-bit panel so that he can do
all of his color work on one monitor and
he can do all of his other work on
another monitor he wants a third monitor
I was like really nine well I'm what am
I made of money no wonder I have no
money left right I missed the first 20
minutes are you in the lines meet your
group house yes
Xbox one meme sorry I can't really click
links during the stream just because I
never know what's there wow there's a
lot of people talking about the new and
video driver I haven't even heard about
this yet it's so busy I have a dead
pixel what should I do nothing sorry man
you got a dead pixel there's not a whole
lot you can do am I the only one who
finds white PCB super sexy no you're not
I actually bought a sapphire 690 G
motherboard it was an m ATX board in
fact it might be in my parents old media
PC which might be over there I might go
check that out later it might still be
in there but I bought it just even
though I knew that a sapphire
motherboard was probably gonna be a
problem they had no experience with
motherboards it was like their first one
but I bought it just cuz it had a white
PCB it was awesome why don't you Skype
for callin because we are looking for
someone to sponsor the Collins because
right now the live streams are a money
sink just to pay myself and slick to sit
here and talk to you guys for an hour
and a half I am losing money so there
you go
so I'm trying to find a way to have the
live stream be somewhat sponsored or
whatever else did you hear about the 200
watt TDP I didn't hear it was a 200 watt
TDP but I'm not surprised should I
upgrade to Haswell now sure why not it's
not like Intel's gonna be releasing
anything new aim DS come out right and
said they don't have anything new coming
for 2013 that isn't an APU so yeah go
for it Wow do you recommend redundant
radiators and pumps for extreme builds
with Titans and extreme CPU um I never
really recommend dual loop but it is
never a bad idea to put a couple of
pumps in serial because then you get not
only increased pumping head pressure but
you also get redundancy in case one of
the pumps dies and more radiators is
always better even if you are not
actually like even if you don't really
need that cooling power then
you can do is you can turn fans off when
your systems idling if you have a more
advanced fan controller and then you can
just use as much reading as you need and
then as your your system loads and your
water heats up you can have the fans
kick in that's what that's what I do on
my system so yes more radiators is
always better if you want a quiet system
okay why can't monitors go right to the
edge for a true bezel this experience
the reality of it is is that it's about
more than just having the monitor stuff
on your desk so if you just manufacture
to monitor and moved it straight from
the production line to a desk it would
probably be fine but they have to design
them to withstand packing and shipping
and being display models in stores and
all of these things that they're gonna
undergo and that is why you cannot have
a bezel this monitor because someone is
gonna dunk it up and the manufacturer
has to cover their butts on that so
let's move into our next topic which is
I mean everyone wants me to talk about
all of these topics that I had lined up
so I guess I better better do it the new
Mac Pro so this one was submitted by Jam
dude unfortunately it seems oh wait what
that's wrong link dang it
well whatever the new Mac Pro was
submitted by someone so the new Mac Pro
is a little cylinder it has three PCBs
it has dual AMD workstation great
graphics cards and it has like a 12 core
CPU or something stupid like that very
cool very cool form factor apples
basically banking on thunderbolt being
the only way people expand their pcs I
mean the last Mac Pro upgrade we got was
what almost a decade ago or something
like that in terms of a major Mac Pro
upgrade and I don't know how ever long
it was I pay very little attention and
I'm very sorry for that but the last
major Mac Pro upgrade we got was a long
time ago they're updating it in such a
way that I think they're forward-looking
enough that they are expecting to not
update it for a similar period of time
again so they're basically going to
themselves okay we are expecting by that
time nobody is gonna upgrade storage
internally in their computers I mean
apples never really been about upgrading
the storage in their Mac Pro's but I
think the most they've ever had is for
expansion slots for three and a half
inch drive
which is abysmal I mean especially when
you compare it to that that ass Rock
motherboard that was on display at
Computex that supports 22 drives
directly attached so okay so there's
that they are banking on I think pretty
much every peripheral connecting to the
computer whether it is something more
basic like a USB thumb drive or whether
it is something more advanced like an
acceleration card such as like a red
rocket which is for working with 4k
files within that are in the red RAW
format that you shoot on red cameras so
something like a red rocket I think
they're expecting to run externally over
a thunderbolt which is basically PCI
Express so having things like external
PCI Express boxes like the Magna 3 tree
which we checked out recently and
unfortunately we're just waiting for
drivers to catch up and support to catch
up so you can have external graphics
cards and external accelerator cards and
all that kind of stuff they are
expecting all of that to be external at
some point in time all the storage
everything so it has six Thunderbolt two
so that's 20 gigabit per second ports
actually Anandtech has a great
everything you need to know about
Thunderbolt go check it out or
thunderbolt to go check it out it's
awesome it covers this new tech very
thoroughly so they've got six of those
and I look at it and I go cool great
value right now if you want something
that's very forward-thinking very
powerful and priced reasonably but we've
seen this time and time again it
actually kind of drives me crazy when
viewers or members of the forum saying
oh don't buy Apple computers they're
overpriced sometimes they are sometimes
they're not at launch I mean if you guys
looked at the MacBook Pro that had the
it was the black one or something like
that so a couple generations ago when
that one launched I actually priced it
out so the first Intel based Mac books
the second ones I was looking at them
because man they're beautiful machines I
mean until until we had PC manufacturers
like Acer building stuff like this I
love my s7 although the new gen s7 hold
wickedness I need one fixes all my
complaints about this one better battery
life better touch
had a little slightly thinner anyway so
before that we didn't have a PC
manufacturer who was even close to Apple
in terms of the build quality of their
machines now we have a sir we have Razer
we have the Suzanne book Infiniti the
landscape has changed so I was pricing
those out and the reality of it was if
you give Apple even a couple bucks for
having a better chassis and that costs
money trust me it costs money in the
tooling it costs money in the actual
manufacturer of each unit
they were pretty competitive at lunch
the problem is that Apple doesn't update
their pricing in any way and a lot of
the time they're not updating the
product so you looked at something like
the last generation Mac Pro where the
graphics card options were a complete
joke like it was just stupid we're
looking at graphics cards they're like
do they really even make these anymore
but at lunch it was fine and it made
sense so buying something like a Mac Pro
right now if you want to be
forward-thinking and you want to you
know have that Thunderbolt connectivity
and all that stuff may actually make
sense it's probably reasonably
competitive with the other solutions
that are out there if you want the
functionality that it enables but and
this is that double-edged sword because
part of what makes that Mac Pro lasts so
long is the fact that Apple's not going
to significantly update their hardware
and they're not going to significantly
update their pricing so if you were to
hold out for three years and be shopping
for a workstation again it's probably
not gonna make a whole lot of sense by
then we're gonna have ivy bridge-e or
haswell-e or whatever next generation
platform that's available on the desktop
if you build yourself a proper tower
you're gonna have I mean still internal
expansion is gonna be king for a while
say the three is not going to be too
slow for hard drives for a really long
time
even though SSDs are outpacing it
already so if you wait a few years
a desktops gonna make a lot more sense
than something like a Mac Pro it's all
about timing
buying an apple at launch good idea
buying an Apple sort of a year after
launch when they're close to another
refresh is a terrible terrible value so
there you go that's my take on the new
Mac Pro
oh yeah I mean another example when when
Apple first launched the iMac with the
2560 by 1440 IPS display built in it was
slim it was
sexy the hardware spec was outstanding I
tried someone asked me Linus can I build
a PC like this for this price I want to
buy a PC but otherwise I'm just gonna
buy the iMac and I tried to make a PC
that was competitive and the part that I
kept getting stuck on was that gorgeous
27 inch display PCs took the PC guys
took so long to figure out that high
resolution displays don't need to be
that expensive this was before you could
get cheap ones on eBay so I was really
frustrated because I was like no I I
can't build you an equivalent machine
because that display is really expensive
to buy stand-alone and and that's one of
the things that Apple is so good at I
mean those AMD GPUs those workstation
great graphics cards if you really want
workstation grade cards and you're
buying a PC you want it to compete with
mac pro your probably gonna have a hard
time right now but that'll change anyway
so I'm done with that now ah yes AMD are
actually you know what let's do let's do
Xbox is launching in 21 countries
what are they high so the of a headline
here from Jam dude on the forum is Xbox
one unplayable in 180 countries so if
you check out the article on game debate
I really hope that this is just like I'm
gonna list the countries that you can
actually play an Xbox one game in like
I'm gonna list the ones you can because
it's a much shorter list than the ones
you can't Australia Austria Belgium
Brazil Canada Denmark Finland France
Germany Ireland Italy Mexico Netherlands
New Zealand Norway Russia Spain Sweden
Switzerland United Kingdom in the United
States seriously so ok no India no China
so write it right there BAM that's a
third of the world gone done
there's your market cap no Japan I mean
the odds of any of them actually buying
an Xbox one anyway I suppose are pretty
slim because you know Sony and rarara
and all that but really no Greece
ok I may be no one there can afford one
anyway but I'm starting to see a pattern
here no no but seriously I mean not
having not having the products available
in these territories is just
unbelievable to me I mean no Poland no
Argentina no Peru no I mean the only
country in all of South America where
you're going to be able to use
Xbox one is Brazil and yeah Brazil's a
really important market right now for a
lot of business but at know Portugal so
heaven forbid that you're someone who
lives in Spain and you get a job offer
in Portugal and you move there and it's
gonna be region locked the software
titles won't work you won't be I'm I'm
I'm running out of gas on this one
because I don't even know what there is
to say so we're gonna go to the Twitter
boards what do you guys think of Xbox
one launching in whatever it is 21
countries which is just the most
ludicrous thing apparently I'm slightly
out of focus I'm not too worried about
that right now because I'm tired host
said the cost of the next box one the
look on his face and the lack of
response in the crowd okay sure
respect out 27 in time excuse way better
performance per dollar than a MacPro IMO
that's cool that I mean remember it's
always in flux when things get updated
who don't get updated personal rig
living at home yeah the personal rate
will be staying at home I'm super sad
about the the fact that I'm gonna have
to move my ten gigabit network
infrastructure to the office here I'm so
sad about that because I've been
enjoying that and then I'm also gonna
have to move my like wicked Nazz machine
so I'm gonna have to go back to being a
mere mortal with an AZ instead of having
my arica 24 portrayed card with like my
like beast raid 6 array and all that and
yeah
boom boom boom anyway have you ever done
any system admin work before like Active
Directory assistant no I haven't invite
the guy from fractal he'll join us again
at some point could you do a custom
water cooling loop from a PC please nope
sorry I'll go check out the forum
there's lots of people who know as much
as I do about water cooling if not more
what's your opinion on iOS 7 you know
what I think Marcus Brownlee actually
covered this really well so if you guys
haven't checked out any of these videos
before youtube.com slash Mart it's hot
it's kind of a weird spelling of Marcus
but there we go youtube.com slash Marcus
Brownlee go check him out he does great
videos and he has one here called where
iOS 7 features come from
and it's basically it's kind of like
it's kind of like texting the kids has
Apple ever really invented anything
video where it really looks at where the
ideas for these and all likelihood came
from Xbox one will only have a 500 gig
hard drive which can't be replaced yeah
that to me is actually one of the most
insane things about Xbox one I was even
I was actually giving ie I mean you guys
probably know this if you followed at
all what we've been doing for the last
week or so but I was at Computex with WD
and we were hanging out with those guys
like every other day and at one point I
was just like guys what's the deal how
did you let Microsoft get away with some
goofy proprietary hard drive that can't
be replaced
and is 500 gigs I mean Western Digital
is showing was showing off at Computex 7
millimeter one terabyte drives they're
not even expensive the 500 gigs is last
gen already that's last gen that's like
unbelievable that this is acceptable in
this day and age and when you consider
that Xbox one has a blu-ray player we're
going to be looking at games that you're
going to be able to fill your Xbox with
what like like about 20 gigs per disk so
5 eggs 25 games your Xbox one will be
full I know people who have like an
order of magnitude larger game libraries
than that for a given console and the
fact that you're not going to be able to
run off the disk that's one of the most
insane things about Xbox one to me in
fact that particular spec doesn't seem
to be getting as much attention as I
think it should be techy with an SSD in
the back pocket but uh something I think
we're too zoomed in right now because
for some reason I'm not able to see
people's whole tweets but a mortal
network at home well it still still be
gigabit I mean what does that test bench
I've seen you using it's the high speed
PC tech station
CD Projekt RED can't even play their own
game in their own home country on the
Xbox one yes that is a big problem it's
ok no one cares about Xbox one will wait
patiently for ps4 yeah that's gonna be a
big problem too I I suspect ps4s to me
just as bad at some point of course our
k95 video soon I don't know if you
spotted this or not
yes k95 video will be coming soon this
is actually that shelf behind me is
serving as sort of a to be unboxed pile
so there's a lot of stuff on there
that's I going to be unboxing over the
next little bit wait for the 49 30 K or
pick up a 3930k now honestly 49 30 K is
not going to be rocket science in terms
of the performance benefit you're gonna
get it's going to be Ivybridge r pardon
me Sandy Bridge vs. Ivy Bridge so we're
gonna be looking at about 10 percent
improvement in IPC and it's gonna
overclock slightly less just like on the
mainstream platform so personally I I
don't know if I'd wait it's gonna be on
the same platform at 79 Mac Pro equals
trashcan for your spare hardware not
really not familiar with that
unfortunately since Poland yep
yeah Witcher 3 dad's cannot play their
own game on a retail is the online
requirement that perfects ice ball comes
from the same reason games from Windows
Live is only available in the same 27
countries yeah
and in Portugal and can't buy one not
that I would buy one anyway alright can
you please talk about a shadow play on
the gtx 770 ardours it to software it's
both all Kepler GPUs have built in h.264
encoding which means that as long as the
card is capable of displaying the output
okay which it is um and it has the h.264
built-in encoder it can very quickly and
easily with very little overhead take
that video stream and it can make it
into a small lightweight file that is
going to still be very high quality so
it's very very cool GTX 260 I am not
convinced there's any good reason to
have a dedicated PhysX card I've never
really seen a benefit alright alright
alright so drew wants me to talk about
AMD's upcoming 5 gigahertz CPU so let's
go check that out
so AMD has been pretty serious business
about picking up where their competitors
are leaving off in terms of things like
gaming bundles and in terms of things
like catering to the enthusiast so
Andy's new FX 95 90 was on display at e3
with a Radeon HD 7990 this was submitted
by CERN
and okay the system is powered by 16
gigs around new AMD hardware so I've had
a lot of people tweeting at me about
this
CPU so the CPU mm-hmm will be piledriver
based we already know this because AMD
already said several times we don't have
a new CPU architecture coming this year
it'll be somewhat refined but because
it's piledriver based because we're not
looking at a new process node because
we're not looking at a new architecture
it will be a power hog and it will
output a ton of heat we also know that
it's not going to overclock that much
people have been asking me how do you
think this chip will perform it will
perform wait for it it will perform just
like an 80 350 at 5 gigahertz I'm like
that's thinking I don't know I can I get
a kick out of this like when people ask
me how do you think before the gtx 770
launched how do you think 770 is gonna
perform based on what we already know
about it which is that it's very similar
to gtx 680 but it has faster memory to
which i would reply it will perform just
like a 680 but it'll have faster memory
so probably a high resolution is going
to do better and yeah so we're looking
at a very similar situation it is this
very cool yes I hope that AMD does what
they need to do to capture the hearts of
the enthusiasts to sell more of these
chips I think it's good for their
business I think being able to drive up
their ASP s is very positive I hope they
bring some bundles into it you look at
what they've been doing on AP use with
things like SimCity bundles and as
unpopular as SimCity might be it's still
a game people are still playing with it
and it comes for free with your CPU you
can't really complain too much about it
if they do the same things they're doing
on the graphics side with CPU we might
be looking at a rejuvenated AMD that is
able to sell some CPUs and if they're
able to sell some CPUs they're gonna
have some money to dump back into R&amp;amp;D so
that they can develop better CPUs and
there's no one who is more happy than
any Hardware enthusiast to see a strong
AMD because a strong AMD means Intel
cannot be complacent and cannot ignore
the enthusiasts because the enthusiasts
even though they're a very small market
segment in terms of sales are extremely
loud and they drive sales in the other
market segments so as long as AMD is
competitive it is very very very good
news for the enthusiasts I mean the
rumors I don't know if it's true or not
I've seen some tweets tonight about a
200 watt TDP for the tip that's that's
awesome I guess that's crazy I mean I
personally don't really care about the
TDP of my cpu as far as I'm concerned
bring it on
give me a good reason to have a thousand
watt power supply have one anyway bring
it on give me a good reason to have
water cooling I have it anyway so I
personally don't care but there will be
situations where it'll be a problem I
mean I would I probably wouldn't deploy
a ninety five ninety or whatever they
end up calling it in my in my computer
room and the reason for that is I'm
right above my garage and it gets
extremely hot in the summer as it is
with the GTX 590 in there the 5870
that's in my wife's machine as well as
the fact that I'm running a six core
already and remember this will be a
significantly higher heat output then my
six core is already that room already
gets really hot and when you turn on the
computers it gets really hot and having
hotter computers is definitely a bad
thing so yeah I think I think it's great
I think it's cool I think it's fine that
AMD is first to the five gigahertz
barrier I think Intel could have done it
if they'd cared I think Ambu could have
done it sooner if they'd cared as well
but we've been on a rush to sort of more
cores as opposed to higher frequency for
a while so I think it's more just like a
feather in the cap as opposed to
something that's actually meaningful but
I think that if AMD is going to continue
to cater to enthusiasts and gamers I
think that's a really really positive
thing it's good for their business it's
good for gamers it's good for the
industry all right I'm gonna lose my
voice eventually here so we're probably
gonna have to we're probably gonna have
to sort of call this quits pretty soon
here guys can I use an H 100 I fanless
with and the question continues but I'm
already going to tell you know o familis
for idle no probably not
you're probably going to need to have at
least them spinning at sort of 300 400
Pam how come you guys left the booth
babes of the Computex coverage it was by
request the NSA got to Linus r.i.p linus
guys what if all i want to do is game
and i don't care about TV and stuff
what's better ps4 xbox one with any
console generation it's always going to
come down to exclusive titles anyway so
whichever one has the titles you want to
play so there you go
not selling the Xbox one in China so it
is made in the Asia region they won't be
selling it there well yeah I mean
they'll probably add more countries at
some point and remember a lot of the
problems with selling it are not going
to be necessarily Microsoft's fault at
all sometimes there are regulations that
prevent them from easily being able to
import them and integrate their services
so we'll see how it goes you should use
Google Voice instead yes I probably
should I have a paid Skype account right
now I'm not not happy with it and diesel
has a Google Voice account and he's very
happy with it so have you seen the new
MacBook Pro it is a trashcan it's a very
powerful very cool piece of hardware is
what it actually is but sure thoughts on
e3 honestly I've paid so little
attention to the e3 coverage other than
the ongoing train wreck that is
Microsoft's PR for the Xbox one
so unfortunately I can't really comment
I'm sure slicks been paying more
attention to it than I have so we'll
have a bit more of a bit more of a
discussion on the gaming side of things
probably next week I would think this is
weird this thing shifted this thing I
can see through it now to the background
um okay three new interactions please
talk about the Haswell controversy
we're Intel cherry-picked review samples
and retail trips from significantly
hotter um you know what iiiiii heard
sort of caught wind of it I'm not aware
that that's anything that actually
happened and honestly from my experience
with guys like hardware manufacturers
who aren't Intel I really doubt it I
think the the problem here is that the
people who are getting okay so a couple
things number one is when I got briefed
on Haswell by the motherboard guys not
by Intel they basically said look
there's a huge range there's going to be
ones that are awesome there's gonna be
ones that are totally bunk when it comes
to overclocking and there's going to be
a lot in between
I had the opportunity to have my hands
on a cherry I had a cherry picked CPU
directly from JJ it was his second best
one out of I think he'd Bend about 50 or
60 of them and that was in case my
sample from Intel was a horrendous
overclocker
and I couldn't actually do my
overclocking guide and show any kind of
reasonable result whatsoever because the
JJ has had his hands personally on chips
that were not very good overclockers at
all so that to me indicates a couple of
things number one is there's a range out
there and the guys who get a bunk chip
are very likely to be the ones
complaining that there has well chip
runs hot or doesn't overclock very well
okay so but we already knew this at
least I knew this number two is that
indicates to me that even a soos so in
the case of JJ having a ton of chips
tube in from got everything from great
ones to not very good ones okay so not
all the es is for cherry picked my es is
very mediocre very run-of-the-mill it's
an Intel confidential chip so that's
probably as review sample as anyone
elses and it's middle-of-the-road maybe
a little bit on the better side I
thought it was better than it actually
was when I was filming the video but
what happened was JJ explained to me
there are a few more things that I could
do to push it that would indicate if it
was a really good one or not and it's
kind of I think it's about top 35
percent or so but it's nothing super
super special or anything like that and
so I think what's happening is people
are getting Haswell chips they're not
happy with them and they're complaining
whereas the people that are getting them
and they are happy with them are not
complaining
and honestly again this is one of those
things where I kind of go well I'm used
to this I've seen this before
not not necessarily I don't think either
Intel or AMD has particularly
cherry-picked review sample CPUs in a
long time I don't think they really
focus on the enthusiast overclocking
scene as much as they used to to the
extent where they actually used to go
through and like bin CPUs for famous
overclockers like Fugger and there's a
huge controversy over that these days I
know for a fact Andrei yang who won
eight of the events at the OC main event
at Computex Bend his own CPUs Intel
didn't bend them for them
for him and send them to him so I don't
think they really do it anymore with all
that said I don't know this for a fact
this is all my speculation based on what
I know so I I don't know if that
happened anyway so we used to have to do
this anyway there was a time when you
know even something like a twenty five
hundred plus which was a legendary chip
some of them were great overclockers
most of them were pretty good
overclockers and some of them are very
good mine wasn't very good I'm just
trying to think if my Opteron 165 wasn't
that great it was a little bit better
than my 4400 plus but not much and they
were supposed to be amazing overclockers
myyy 6600 was awesome I had that thing
at 4 gigahertz 24/7 mind you I had
chilled liquid on it what else what have
I ever had like a like a bunk chip I
mean my 7870 doesn't overclock worth a
damn even though it's an MSI whatever
aftermarket cooler and custom PCB I mean
sometimes a chip just doesn't overclock
and that's bad luck and with Haswell I
already knew and I know some of the
manufacturers already knew there was
gonna be a much wider larger percentage
of chips that just weren't gonna
overclock so it used to be on farms like
Xtreme systems or extreme overclocking
back in the day but there was a very
regular churning through of chips like
people would actually be able to sell a
golden chip or a decent overclocker for
more than retail price and oh oh oh my
battery died
you
okay I guess we're back sort of this is
my battery that's dead I don't have the
charger for the fs700 here so I yeah
there's a lot of stuff that's not moved
to the new place it's actually gonna be
a really busy weekend this weekend so
yeah it's gonna be gonna be kind of
crazy you know what I should probably do
is I should probably do the the build of
the week I had Oh
oh snap I had one sent to me that the
the mod team wanted me to include so
there we go I'm gonna go ahead and grab
this one Oh apparently audios out under
my audio is out it's very strange
gah hmm OOP dude I don't know if there's
anything I can do about that right now
hmm I didn't change anything
check check it's definitely getting
picked up by the camera three to four
seconds I don't know what 3 to 4 seconds
means man got messages that I don't
understand
so hopefully the hopefully the audio is
back now I have no idea Oh audio is out
audio is distinct ah I see
well I think there's something we can
actually do about that if I go in here
and i refresh this it'll either crash
the string did it fix it hopefully we're
good all right so let's do our system of
the week so apparently I have a thing in
here yeah I'm gettin getting skype
messages they're like my bad and I'm
like yeah way to go way to be like
helping me and not doing
how too quickly enough all right so we
have two different system builds of the
week and we are going to look at for a
limited time only by
this alright add screen region and we're
just gonna add the whole screen so you
guys will see all my junk so first up is
Andre vitur
with Andres personal z77 rig so this is
the more attainable rig and yes that is
another oh wait no that isn't that's uh
what wow I'm uh I'm losing it here what
is that a 650d I don't even know
that's a 650d right I haven't seen a
650d in so long I don't think that's a
650 d someone help me apparently I just
shouldn't even do system build of the
week because I there's a reason I leave
this too slick yeah parently it is a 650
d so he's got a knock - NH d 14 although
oh my goodness okay you know what we're
doing system of the weekend because holy
freakin crap oh and also I had this like
super small you guys were looking at
this the whole time see this is this
this is this is this is terrible
uh okay so not too as booth at Computex
I actually have a lot of people asking
me what was your like favorite thing you
saw at Computex their active noise
cancellation heatsink is unreal it works
they had the demo they had there had the
heatsink and it had a shroud over it I
had a fan in the middle so the shroud
serves a number of purposes allowing the
air to be channeled more directly so
they figured with one fan they were able
to get similar performance to the
successor to the NHD 14 that they also
had on display there okay so it
channel's the airflow better and the
shroud creates a controlled environment
for the active noise cancellation that
basically vibrates the blades to cancel
out the noise of the spinning of the
blades they had a microphone next to the
heatsink that you could put on like
noise cancelling headphones so you could
actually hear it in the hall and they
could go active noise canceling on
active noise canceling off and you can
hear the difference so it's not one of
those things where it's like they've
created a completely silent fan it makes
no noise it doesn't work that way but
what they've done is they've taken the
fan noise from like
pardon my humming - like like it's a
much lower hum and it basically sounds
like much lower rpm fan operation except
that it's not it's freaking awesome so I
am super excited about that anyway look
we can go back to our we can go back to
our build of the week which I have
completely lost now and have no idea
where it is anymore I downloaded it
there it is alright so we're gonna go
back to scene 4 and we're gonna put this
one on but there we go alright so we've
got a 650d knocked to a fan's which I of
course am thrilled to see NHD 14 MSI
twin frozen 3 graphics card ax 850
extremely clean cable management this is
the kind of build that pretty much
anyone can do you can see how the SATA
cables are routed very nicely I love
when things line up like this so you can
take the right angle SATA cables right
out of here this is one of the benefits
someone asked me earlier on the stream
about 24-pin power connectors having our
right angle 24-pin power connectors it'd
be great to have that somewhere like
here so you wouldn't have to have this
loop coming up here and it could be even
cleaner in fact I'd be this would be
kind of cool to see a graphics card
manufacturer put the power connectors on
the bottom of the graphics card so you
wouldn't even have to run these cables
over here you could have a machine that
almost looks entirely cable free so
here's the SATA cables for this and then
everything in here is tucked in here
love modular power supplies for this
very clean cable routing on the back I
personally don't have the discipline to
do this I always end up with a rat's
nest on the back but when people do it
it looks fantastic this one is awesome
actually I had picked one that the that
the forum moderation team did not give
me and this was the one that I picked to
showcase so this is g5 by Shaw and check
that out so his build blog is awesome it
has a ton of different pictures check
out the build blog section of the forum
go look for these two builds so he took
a g5 case so remember guys this is the
old g5 with one optical drive completely
gutted it and did a sweet liquid-cooled
in fact these two pictures that were
picked out by the Mahad team we're
actually the same two pictures I picked
out for my own
wings looks outstanding beautiful
compression fittings SLI graphics cards
man this thing looks nice and check out
the builds of the week thread in the
forum for links to this so that you can
go and see all the details that go into
creating machines of this caliber
they're absolutely outstanding and we
are just so thrilled to have like that
kind of awesome stuff going on our forum
next to actually actually have another
topic that I did want to talk about ea
wants to stop being hated good luck with
that
so that was submitted on the forum by
depth event at that Oh woo what why is
cloud player doing something here oh
okay hmm
Oh can't find it anymore sorry
apparently Fred's gone if people oh this
is something if people change the the
titles of their threads on the forum the
links all died so I don't recommend
doing that but EA wants to stop being
hated let's see if they decide to buck
trends like not requiring games to phone
home as often as they can I mean
Microsoft's made it pretty clear that
stuff like always-on is at the
discretion of the game devs so if EA
wants to not be hated they're gonna have
to speak with actions not words and I
just kind of doubt it right now PCI
Express SSDs on the new MacBook Air so a
non tech had an article about this I'm
going to link first to the form
submission that linked to the anon tech
article so this was from Carrie canning
or whatever however I say that
so Apple didn't say it during the show
but it seems the MacBook Air got more
than just a CPU upgrade the transfer
speeds are far higher than any state of
three discs and averages around 790
megabytes per second reads and 740
megabytes per second writes the flip
side however seems to be this
proprietary solution so no unfortunately
this is not an m2 a solution or ntg f4
whatever that standard is that's PCI
Express base SSD this is a proprietary
solution so you probably will get
aftermarket upgrades at some point but
it'll take a while at best
and I mean that's just like apples way
of doing things and I'm going to have a
bit of an unpopular opinion here but
okay even when we went okay when we went
from hard drives to SSDs we had a
technology change SSDs are dramatically
faster than hard drives for random
operations random operations so even
compared to the SATA 2 interface an SSD
that's being read read from or written
to very heavily very randomly is not
saturating that bus because we're still
limited by the NAND flash and that's
going to continue to be an issue as
process nodes shrink the flash
inherently gets less high performance as
we move to technologies like TLC
particularly right speed is going to be
lower performance so ok already for the
part of your computer where we're really
benefiting from an SSD which is not
sequential reads and writes because you
don't copy files back and forth all day
folks we already didn't even care that
much about say 2 3 so you go back and
look at SATA 3 SSD is a lot of the first
reviews drives like vertex 3 did they
perform better you know what I gotta
take this
I'm gonna put I'm gonna put the stream
on hold for a minute sorry guys hello
you
right and we're back sorry the wife
called had to take that very important
very important call because if I don't
take that call I'm stuck here b-roll
left without me so they're okay on
popular opinion I don't think it matters
that much until we see a dramatic
improvement in the complexity of the
controllers and until we see some kind
of change in the storage medium that
we're using on these drives because NAND
is not getting high performance
particularly over time I mean we can
spread it out over more channels but
then we're looking at a controller
complexity increase which we haven't
really seen much of you in the last
little while anyway ah or we can switch
to something other than and I have no
idea what the future holds in terms of
storage but you can much like hard
drives being the be-all and end-all
forever not s NAND flash is not the
be-all and end-all forever necessarily
either so back when say the three SSDs
first launched a lot of the reviews took
the time to test all the SATA to SSDs on
SATA 2 controllers all to see the three
SSDs on SATA 2 controllers and all the
SATA 3 SSDs on SATA 3 controllers and
while we saw particularly in things like
peak reads and writes dramatic
improvements going from SATA 2 to SATA 3
4 these enabled drives when it came to
more real-world simulated testing things
like PC Mark or things like a non text
storage bench the difference wasn't that
dramatic I mean yeah it's great to get
another 10% or another 20% but when
we're talking about a world where most
people are still using hard drives as
opposed to SSDs anyway the upgrade from
a hard drive to an SSD versus the
upgrade from an SSD to a SATA 3 SSD or a
PCI Express based SSD this upgrade is
not going to be that significant
compared to this one and much like going
from a single core to a dual core and
then going from a dual core to a quad
core really didn't impress people the
same way that it did sort of the first
time around so 800 megabyte per second
sequential czar cool but sequential 'z
haven't met anything in a very long time
and another step toward ok this is
probably to me what this looks like is
another step towards putting storage
directly on motherboards on the desktop
I suspect within another five years we
may see soldered CPUs we may see
soldered storage you might buy like you
might just buy a computer like there
might be like a core i7 computer an i5
computer and an i3 computer and that
might be what we end with maybe it's not
five years maybe it's ten years
but III yeah I don't know I don't know
how I feel about that let me see if
there's anything left here and I think
that is pretty much it for this week
guys thank you so much for tuning in to
the live stream I'm sorry there were
some complications with the lateness and
with the sort of blacking out and the
audio desync and all that stuff but you
guys are awesome and I appreciate you
tuning in and I hope it wasn't boring
with just me versus having slick here to
keep all of us company and good night
