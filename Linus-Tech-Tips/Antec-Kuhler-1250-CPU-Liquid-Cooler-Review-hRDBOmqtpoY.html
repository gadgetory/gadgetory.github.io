or Core i5 processor and get a free copy
of Rome 2 total war click now to learn
more alright so there's not much
innovation left in the whole prefilled
liquid coolers thing basically you're
going to have to have a CPU block a pump
a radiator tubing and coolant inside
that's ok I guess you'll also need some
fans on it to actually take the heat
away but that didn't stop an Tek from
trying here guys ok so this my friends
is the cooler h2o 1250 a truly unique if
nothing else all in one liquid cooling
units so unlike many of the products on
the market this is not a coolant or an
ASA Tek rebrand this is an an Tek design
that is very different from some of the
other stuff that we've seen on the
market that much will be apparent just
looking at the thing so let's start with
the features that really stand out so
number one is that it uses a dual
radiator so not all liquid coolers out
there use a dual rad most of them still
use single 120 or at the very most
single 140 millimeter say standard thick
radiator with a fairly high fin density
so it is definitely going to perform
optimally in a push-pull style
configuration which is why ntek actually
shipped the unit with not only the fans
that are pre-installed but also a couple
of extras although we will be testing in
our standard configuration which is two
fans not push-pull so there you go guys
it also has integrated fans so
integrated fans and shrouds these are in
a push configuration by default and
because of the bulk of the tubing and
pumps on the one side of the fan here it
does only go in one way so compatibility
may be a little bit more of a challenge
with this one and with other ones versus
having one larger tank at one side and
then a smaller tank at the other side it
has two medium-sized tanks at each side
to accommodate the extra tubing alright
so the next thing I actually mentioned
this briefly already is the dual pump
design so it has two pumps built in one
on each of the fan hubs here this again
adds bulk but it also adds potentially
performance but more importantly redone
see if one of these pumps were to fail
the other one would be able to keep
operating the unit regardless this is
one of the things that I dislike about
all-in-one liquid cooling units and that
is that they add more points of failure
with a heatsink
you got a fan on it there's one point of
failure with an all-in-one liquid
cooling unit you've got usually one fan
and one pump which is two points of
failure so two ways for the unit to die
it also has what they're calling a
sophisticated micro channel cold plate
design on why they insist on calling in
cold plates come on the entire water
cooling community calls the water blocks
why can't we just call them that anyway
so the water block has a pre apply
applied thermal compound on it and hooks
into your system in pretty much the
manner that we've come to expect from
any of these prefilled liquid cooling
units that does have built-in control so
you've actually got oh my goodness look
at all the wires okay here we go
and they're all black so you should be
able to hide them relatively easily so
we have power so you can go ahead and
plug that into your CPU fan header then
we have USB so you're actually going to
use an Tex grid software in order to
configure things like the customizable
RGB LED on the top as well as things
like pump speed and fan speed you can
monitor your coolant temperatures and
all that good stuff and then finally
also coming out of the unit here we have
two wires that head into y splitters so
we can power the two fans that are built
into the unit and then two additional
fans directly off of the pump right here
so that's pretty much the summary I
guess all that's left to it oh yeah it
has a coolant inside that's water-based
with black also pretty pretty typical
stuff over the lips a proprietary blend
or something like that so all that's
really left now is how does the thing
perform well I guess we'll find out is
it worth the compatibility disadvantages
and the customizability disadvantages of
not being able to swap in your own fans
in order to have that redundancy and
potentially better performance I'll
leave that to Luke to determine for you
guys on our standard test bench I'm
running a 3930k at 4.0 gigahertz with a
voltage of 1.3 and that processor is
crunching numbers in prime95 I also have
an NVIDIA GTX 580 running combustor and
overclocked a little bit just to add
some more heat to the system for
halation problems we didn't actually
have any unless we wanted to put more
fans on top of the radiator in which it
would not have worked in our case
configuration at all if you're looking
to buy this product just make sure that
your case and motherboard combination is
going to be compatible with the
configuration you're going to want this
cooler in because you might have trouble
with how your case has the radiator
aligned and how your heat sinks on your
motherboard stand out I was informed
that I couldn't swap out the stock fans
but I wanted to try anyways just because
I love you guys and I got that off but I
found that once the fan was off I
couldn't actually put a new fan on
realistically because the power for the
pumps was ran through the fans so I
didn't bother and we ran with the stock
fans and we ran the stock fans at 1,100
rpm just like we normally do our Noctua
fans there's a little bit of a variable
here as all the other coolers are tested
with Noctua nff 12s and these ones are
not but it's as close as we could get it
in a market awash with look-alikes the
cooler 1250 didn't do quite as well as
its competition that being other to buy
120 all in one liquid coolers but it's
an interesting innovative cooler and I'm
excited to see where they go with it if
you like this style of cooler or if you
don't like this style of cooler be sure
