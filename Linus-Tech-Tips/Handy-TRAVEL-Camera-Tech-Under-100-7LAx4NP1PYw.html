big group trip to Mexico and I thought I
would go over a few of the Handy
accessories I take with me everywhere I
bring a camera as either a just-in-case
item or something I cannot travel
without so here is handy tech under 100
travel edition
first up we have the black widow spider
holster this is my favorite way to carry
the stills camera I bring with me
everywhere the fujifilm x100t how it
works is you attach the mini ball joint
to the quarter twenty thread at the
bottom of your camera then you simply
slide the ball joint into the holster as
it clicks into place the holster
conveniently slips on to most belts but
if your belt is too big for some reason
you can always use the included belt in
the kit the kit I got also came with a
soft pad that goes onto your camera so
when you're walking around it isn't
hitting your jeans or pants and
potentially scratching your camera so
getting into usage you simply push down
the red lever on the left of the Black
Widow pull your camera out take your
shots and slide it right back in this is
really simplified the way I travel with
a camera for stills I had this with me
on a recent trip to Japan and it was
particularly nice to always have a
camera with me without carrying it in my
hands or in a large backpack and had my
camera been in a backpack all the time I
would have missed many opportunities to
take a good photo you might be thinking
well why wouldn't you just use a strap
most cameras come with them for free
well personally I find included camera
straps intrusive when moving around
since they are not secured close to your
body which can lead to them accidentally
hitting something as you're walking
falling forward when you're trying to
tie your shoes or just getting in your
way when you're shooting if you happen
to have to take it off your neck for a
shot which I have done many times in the
past when using a neck strap so for me
the Black Widow is a great solution to
have an easy hands-free way to carry
your camera around everywhere you go I
was able to go from taking pictures of
everyone ziplining in Mexico to going
across myself with zero hassle
in-between and that is the best thing
you can ask of a carrying solution for
your camera
something that doesn't slow you down but
also doesn't keep you from missing a
shot as it happened next up we have the
zoom quick-release adapters I've used
these countless times in the past and
they've saved me a lot of time
traditional lens filters are threaded to
screw onto the front of your lens the
zoom adapters however are taking a
different two-part approach the first
part screws on to the back of the filter
that you want to use the second part
screws onto the lens where your filter
would usually screw into then thanks to
the magic
of wonderful magnets your filter becomes
incredibly easy to take on and off
I've legitimately gotten shots I would
not have gotten if I had taken the time
to screw on ND filters on to the lens
while something was happening the
magnets on the filters are also
surprisingly strong so you don't have to
worry about them falling off if you're
moving quickly the adapters come in
varying filter and lens sizes from 49
millimeters up to 82 millimeters which
will fit most standard photography
lenses
moving on to perhaps my favorite small
camera accessory of all time this little
quick release I found on eBay I am
always looking for ways to save time
while making videos and these have saved
me plenty of time over the years if you
ever make use of external monitors tiny
LED lights or on-camera microphones you
have probably used a friction arm like
this one usually what you have to do
with these friction arms is find a point
on your rig screw it all the way in then
doing the same with whatever add-on
you're using on the other end this is
both an annoying and slow process so
these little quick release plates take
the place of screwing into a mounting
point on your camera setup first you put
the receiving end on your rig then you
take the other end and put it on the arm
or some other quarter-twenty thread that
you want to use the result is something
that is far faster to add to your rig
and take off when needed I have these
little guys on every external monitor we
have in the office and it has made
things much faster when switching
through setups moving on to the full
disclosure section of Handy tech videos
which is pretty simple since all the
items included were purchased by me for
my personal use or for use around the
office the spider holster is from Amazon
the quick release plates are from ebay
and the zoom adapters are from B&amp;amp;H photo
