bit differently in that I am NOT going
to try and stand in front of the camera
but rather I'm going to just hold the
camera and unbox it so this is how this
arrived this is the cooler master note
pal ergo stand let's have a look at some
of the features it boasts first of all
it is four nine inch to 17-inch
notebooks I guess that's quite the range
it has five adjustable angle stand a 140
millimeter silent fan a 4 port USB hub
and desktop setup not for sure if that
is this is obviously attention Linus not
Linus's hat go away okay and they come
in 50 2010 product guide so let's see
what this thing - this is just kind of a
random thing but it's here so we might
as well have a look right go away okay
what do we got I cannot figure out how
this open open now my phone's ringing
what a disaster no that's my parents I
better get this just waiting for my
little brother to go get the cordless so
I thought I'd play with my cat hey
finally they're having some problem with
their internet so obviously that's my
responsibility somehow and not the cable
companies but whatever okay so here we
have a product guide it shows us some
cases the half series the 690 advanced
is basic this finally comes apart cuz
I've got it figured out what it was like
taped over all of the different bulbs so
they got all their coolers there GX
series power supplies human master makes
a lot of stuff actually this is a really
good cooler I unbox this at some point
it's like super cheap and super awesome
and they got all their fans other more
different fans and finally yeah IRA goes
in there it is so that's the one that
we're actually looking at today mm-hmm
so here on the side we find not much on
the other side we find also
much here we go here are all the
features 5 angles so you can adjust it
depending on the ergonomics hence the
name or ghost and yeah it has movable
anti-slip props mad props yo cooling pad
okay that's what it is it has a 4 port
USB hub which we mentioned before with
USB cable clips so it has the cable
management so you can hide the USB
cables then you've got cable management
handles nice 14 centimeter speed
adjustable silent fan you get laser
vision and it also has a desktop it has
desktop cooling application I don't know
what that means but I'm sure it means
something ergonomic design more about
ergonomic design ok it's made of metal
mesh plastic and rubber it's the throw
the fan fan speed and fan noise so the
fan speed is 15 decibel it is a rifle
bearing fan it runs at 700 to 1400 RPM
and it has a 40,000 hour mean time
between failure let's get this box
opened up here yeah no I'm already zoom
doesn't maximum okay I'm gonna stand a
little bit to the side so that my my
light can shine so let's see what we got
for accessories in here ok first we have
the USB cable this thing's still not
focusing hold on give me a sec I think
I'm having technical difficulties here
no no there we go let's focus on it okay
so here's the USB cable it is a USB a 2
mini D cable very very very standard ok
nothing exceptional there then we have a
user's manual along with the
specifications this probably has pretty
much everything we already saw on the
outside you'd warranty information thank
you for purchasing the warranty shall be
void if ok I can't see how long it is
but you could always pause it and read
through if you want there we go
and now let's have a look at the ergo
stand itself it comes nicely packed in
foam whatever they are these looks like
they might be oh these are nice
so you got like kind of a it's a heavy
plastic and it's got kind of a matte
finish and then it's got these little
rubber feet on the bottom of it feel
very quality you know how
just sometimes you pick something up and
you go yeah that feels quality that does
and the span is not too bad itself
actually so let's see first of all we're
gonna take this foamy bit off here I may
end up needing that manual to be
perfectly honest okay
so let's figure out how to adjust these
right now I do not know you can go ahead
and adjust my camera though but I can
sort of look down a little bit more okay
that was easy so you just kind of snap
it just like that on the side you will
find volume control probably fan speed
Yap fan speed you'll find a power button
as well as a plug so this is powered by
USB and it huh
that's funny I don't see that cable
interesting okay well maybe this one was
just missing it or maybe it's not
included I don't actually know let's go
around to the other side where we were
fine a the USB hub which is not a
powered hub unless you plug in power and
then also a USB cable so oh okay okay I
get it I get it it becomes a powered hub
if you plug in power here which you do
not have to do can it can just be a non
powered hub that's fine okay so here's
how you do all of these five different
adjustments all right so you all you
have to do is you just kind of put it up
like this and then you move this metal
bar which feels very quality by the way
and then you can set it at five
different angles depending on how you
want it to rest so I would probably go
with this angle if it was me and then
we've also got these feet here which I
will have to figure out how they work
hmm oh I got it here we go
so these go in here and then they can be
adjusted either this way or that way
depending how big the notebook you want
to put on here is so what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna go ahead and put them at
the very maximum because the notebook
that I'm gonna put on here is a monster
this is a 17 inch notebook which is the
maximum that this thing can support I'm
also going to do some temperature
testing shortly here but I'm just going
to
go ahead odd man it's heavy hardly
picked that up with one hand so I'm
gonna go ahead and put that on the stand
there we go yeah that leg barely fits on
there so you can see that it's a little
bit over the edges on either side but
not unreasonably so I got access to all
of my ports and then here I'm just I'm
actually gonna just take this and like
put it on the floor or something cuz no
no I can probably adjust it here okay so
I'll take it and put it on its side
right here there we go so now we can
start to see the angle that we're
sitting at so this is designed so that
when you sit at your desk you can have
your wrists at a comfortable angle when
you're using the keyboard or I mean less
comfortable but I guess if you wanted to
watch a movie or something this would be
ideal
my guess okay there's your USB hub so
you can access that around the back of
the laptop
here's your cable management handles is
what they call them so you can run the
cables through there no problem and then
the fan is actually right here right in
the middle so it's gonna blow let me see
how compatible it is with my laptop it
will blow directly onto my GPU fan but
we're only gonna get incidental airflow
on the CPU fan which is here right
forget it it's right there right under
there so yeah I'll do some temperature
testing shortly and thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the note pal
