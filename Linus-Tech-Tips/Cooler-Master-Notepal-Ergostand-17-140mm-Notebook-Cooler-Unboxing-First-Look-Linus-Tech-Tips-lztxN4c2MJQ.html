bit differently in that I am NOT going
to try and stand in front of the camera
but rather I'm going to just hold the
camera and unbox it so this is how this
arrived this is the cooler master
notepal our ghost and let's have a look
at some of the features it boasts first
of all it is 49 inch to 17 inch
notebooks I guess that's quite the range
it has five adjustable angle stand a 1
40 millimeter silent fan of 4 port USB
hub and desktop setup not for sure that
is this is obviously attention Linus not
Linus's hat go away ok and they come in
50 2010 product guide so let's see what
this thinking this is just kind of a
random thing but it's here so we might
as well have a look so what go away go
away go attach okay what do we got I
cannot figure out how this open this is
pathetic I'm trying to open this thing
and I can see all kind of this sticker
that's why I can't get it open now my
phone's ringing what a disaster no
that's my parents I better get this just
waiting for my little brother to go get
the cordless so I thought I'd play with
my cat hey finally they're having some
problem with their internet so obviously
that's my responsibility somehow and not
the cable companies but whatever okay so
here we have a product guide it shows us
some cases the half series the 60 90
advances basic this finally comes apart
because I've got it figured out it was
like taped over all of the different
folds so they got all their coolers
their GX series power supplies
coolermaster makes a lot of stuff
actually this is a really good cooler i
unbox this at some point it's like super
cheap and super awesome when they got
all their fans other more different fins
and finally yeah I Argos in there it is
so that's the one that we're actually
looking at today hmm so here on the side
we find not much on the other side we
find also
much here we go here are all the
features five angles so you can adjust
it depending on the ergonomics hence the
name for ghosts and it has movable
anti-slip props mad props yo cooling pad
ok that's what it is it has a four port
USB hub which we mentioned before with
USB cable clips so it has cable
management so you can hide the USB
cables then you've got cable management
handles nice 14 centimeters speed
adjustable silent fan you get laser
vision and it also has a desktop knit
has desktop cooling application I don't
know what that means but I'm sure it
means something ergonomic design more
about ergonomic design ok it's made of
metal mesh plastic and rubber it's the
faux the fan fan speed and family so the
fan speed is 15 decibel it is a rifle
bearing fan it runs at 700 to 1400 RPM
and it has a 40,000 our mean time
between failure let's get this box
opened up here yeah I'm already zoomed
out maximum ok I'm gonna stand a little
bit to the side so that my my light can
shine so let's see what we got for
accessories in here ok first we have the
USB cable this thing's still not
focusing hold on give me a sec I think
I'm having technical difficulties here
no no there we go it's focusing on ok so
here's the USB cable it is a USB a to
mini d table very very very standard ok
nothing exceptional there then we have a
user's manual along with the
specifications this probably has pretty
much everything we already saw on the
outside we warranty information thank
you for purchasing the warranty shall be
void if ok I can't see how long it is
but you could always pause it and read
through if you want there we go and now
let's have a look at the ER ghosts and
itself it comes nicely packed in foam
we've got some tape here I'm just gonna
undo then we got please whatever they
are these look like they might be oh
these are nice so you got like kind of a
it's a heavy plastic and it's got kind
of a matte finish and then it's got
these little rubber feet on the bottom
of it you feel very quality know how you
just sometimes you pick something up in
you
oh yeah that feels quality that does and
the stand is not too bad itself actually
so let's see first of all we're going to
take this phone me bit off here I may
end up needing that manual to be
perfectly honest okay so let's figure
out how to adjust these right now I do
not know i'm going to go ahead and
adjust my camera though that i can sort
of look down a little bit more Wow okay
there we go that was easy so you just
kind of snap it just like that on the
side you will find a volume control
probably fan speed yup fan speed you'll
find a power button as well as a plug so
this is powered by USB and it huh that's
funny I don't see that cable interesting
okay well maybe this one was just
missing it or maybe it's not included I
don't actually know let's go round to
the other side where we will find a the
USB hub which is not a powered hub
unless you plug in power and then also a
USB cable so oh okay okay I get it I get
it it becomes a powered hub if you plug
in power here which you do not have to
do and it can just be a non powered hub
that's fine okay so here's how you do
all of these five different adjustments
alright so you all you have to do is you
just kind of put it up like this and
then you move this metal bar which feels
very quality by the way and then you can
set it at five different angles
depending on how you want it to rest so
I would probably go with this angle if
it was me and then we've also got these
feet here which I will have to figure
out how they work hmm oh I got it here
we go so these go in here and then they
can be adjusted either this way or that
way depending how big the notebook you
want to put on here is so what I'm gonna
do is I'm going to go ahead and put them
at the very maximum because the notebook
that I'm going to put on here is a
monster this is a 17 inch notebook which
is the maximum that this thing can
support I'm also going to do some
temperature testing shortly here but I'm
just going to go ahead
on man it's heavy hardly pick that up
with one hand so I'm going to go ahead
and put that on the stand there we go
yeah that leg barely fits on there so
you can see that it's a little bit over
the edges on either side but not
unreasonably so I got access to all of
my ports and then here I'm just I'm
actually going to just take this and
like put it on the floor or something
cuz no no I can probably attest it here
ok so I'll take it and put it on its
side right here there we go so now we
can start a see the angle that we're
sitting at so this is designed so that
when you sit at your desk you can have
your wrists at a comfortable angle when
you're using the keyboard or I mean less
comfortable but I guess if you wanted to
watch a movie or something this would be
ideal my guess okay there's your USB hub
so you can access that around the back
of the laptop here's your cable
management handles is what they call
them so you can run the cables through
there no problem and then the fan is
actually right here right in the middle
so it's going to blow let me see how
compatible it is with my laptop it will
blow directly onto my GPU fan but we're
only going to get incidental airflow on
the cpu fan which is here right yeah
forget it it's right there right under
there so yeah I'll do some temperature
testing shortly and thank you for
checking out my unboxing of the notepal
her ghost and from cooler master</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
