Android blog I realized I haven't
actually done as many updates as I did
when I did my switch to Windows Phone 8
and there's a very good reason for this
so I went from iOS to Windows Phone 8
back to iOS and now to Android and the
reason I haven't really had much to say
is I haven't really thought of anything
to complain about and in my first two
videos I really did cover most of what I
thought was great about the platform as
well as about the HTC One in particular
so I've been kind of sitting here
thinking what can I possibly say other
than I'm switching to Android and this
will likely be my permanent home for the
foreseeable future now with that said
there are some interesting competitors
in the Android space this right here is
the Galaxy s4 so I'm going to treat this
video as my final thoughts on Android in
general as well as some of the
observations I've made about the HTC One
while using it for 30 days and a little
bit of comparison between the 1 and the
s4 which I've now had my hands on for
about 10 days so we'll start with the
HTC One if I had to complain about
something in Sense 5.0 it's the fact
that five five plus or whatever they're
calling it now it would be the inelegant
implementation of the stock music player
so the stock music player is media music
the stock music player is well
integrated with the OS but the
navigation isn't that great and what I
discovered myself doing because it
doesn't have a built-in EQ is I found
myself trying to find an alternative
music player so the ones that I tried
were whoops excuse me
rocket player as well as winamp
so these have the advantages of EQ
settings but they don't integrate with
the Sense 5.0 UI as well as the stock
one does so for example with the stock
one I can have a lock screen that has a
music player whereas with the other ones
I can't have that on the lock screen but
I can implement it here but even there
their integrations here aren't that
great and they have some strange
behaviors like for example if i plug in
my headphones right now you're gonna see
that it's just going to start playing
music even though I don't necessary
we want it to do that give it a second
give it a second yeah it'll probably
start doing that see there you go so I
have to actually tell it to go away
every time I plug something into the top
of the device so I wish there was one
that was as well integrated as the stock
one but sounded a little better and had
better navigation the market I wish it
kind of had a convenient favourites list
of apps and this one right here app
backup and restore is really cool so
what it does is it just creates a file
that you dump on to your computer and
then you copy that into the into the
folder on another phone and what happens
is as soon as you launch it you can
restore and it'll install all the apps
that you had installed on the device so
I use this when I went from using the
HTC one only to using the galaxy s4 as
well because it allowed me to just load
my entire app load out onto it now I
remember in the tablet version of
Android on honeycomb in the market you
were able to just see all of the apps
that you downloaded before and I wasn't
able to find that but that doesn't mean
it's not there and I found this was a
little bit inelegant so I was getting I
got prompted by every app are you sure
yes are you sure do you agree yes yes so
it took it took a long time to install
all the apps even though I had the full
list so that's something that I that I
wish Android had because with iOS it's
simple you backup your phone you restore
your phone and everything's exactly the
way you left it I did find the people
app a little bit confusing so I'm I
still I'm not really using the stock
Android desktop and I'm not using
blinkfeed I'm just using this list right
here which is more like Gingerbread so I
did find the people app I should
probably turn that I did find the people
app a little bit confusing a lot of the
links that it suggested weren't right
and it didn't pick up on a lot of the
links that I ended up setting up
manually but once I did set them all up
manually it's it's great except that it
doesn't really allow me to pick do I
want to pull that person's Facebook
picture do I want to use my own picture
that I took of them speak so that I know
who I'm talking to because not everyone
uses a picture of themselves for
Facebook so for example when my wife
calls it's a picture of my baby because
that's what she uses for a facebook
picture I can't figure out how to change
multitasking is still a highlight of the
platform for me I love this I do not
miss the hardware button in fact going
to the s4 which is more like the button
loadout that I'm used to where you've
got your context menu button here you've
got your hard home button here and then
your soft back button here this is more
like what I was used to with Android but
I didn't miss it at all with the HTC One
I found that back home and then
multitask was really all I needed
because that that context button has
been replaced with these dots up here
and I actually find it a little bit
easier to press so I mean when I'm
holding the device I hold it like this
so when I'm gonna go back I can reach
back okay that's fine it's a little bit
of a stretch but I don't go back as much
as I might want to access context
because that's your your new tab your
bookmarks although all those kinds of
things which I actually like having on
the right versus having on the bottom
left like that so yeah I thought it was
great the cameras still awesome on the
HTC One I know I've talked about this
before I I played around with Zoe's or
Zoe's which are those sort of 3/4 second
clips that you take and then you can
take some pictures during it I used them
a little bit at first but then I really
found myself not really bothering with
it and just using video a lot more
because it's so quick you can go from
you can go from lock screen to recording
a video in that long and so what I just
found myself doing is if I wanted a four
second video clip all I'm gonna take a
four second video clip that's what I'll
do so the Zoe's didn't really I didn't
really matter that much to me but I do
think they're a better implementation
than Samsung's thing with the still
photo and the audio recording that goes
with it I'd rather have the video and
then I can capture a few still photos at
the same time I do on the other hand
find myself watching highlight reels of
previous days it is so cool if we go
into my photos I'm just gonna pick a
random day such as for example this day
I think we were we did a video shoot so
let's just see what it comes up with on
its own so here's me dressing up the cat
here's our actor as well as our film
crew hears me and diesel crammed into
the back it's a really cool way to look
back at a day of of events
so here's that we did some
behind-the-scenes footage of this
particular shoot so that's what a lot of
it is but yeah it's just it's a it's
just really cool so yeah I do find
myself using this but not not Zoe's at
all
the feeling of solidity with this phone
is outstanding it's really unlike any
other device other than an Apple device
that I've ever seen so I want you to
watch the pressure my thumb's are
exerting on the phone here as hard as I
might press I can't get the phone to
flex which is I mean I kind of took it
for granted a little bit going from iOS
to this phone going from an iPhone 4
which is also a very solid device to
this one I was like oh yeah well
whatever no devices slice of course they
do this is the Galaxy s4 and with this
one you can probably see that Bend
particularly on my right thumb I'm
putting about the same amount of
pressure on it is the s4 a solidly built
device you know what probably it's
better than the s3 it feels better to
hold than the s3 with the squared
corners but it befell the metal backing
which Samsung sacrifices in order to get
things like the optional wireless
charging back cover as well as being
able to integrate your cover like the
front case cover with the back cover and
have it all be one piece in order to
give you that microSD upgrade as well as
the removable battery these are the
sacrifices Samsung has made in order to
to bring you those those functionalities
but I I like the feeling of this and the
honestly the finish on the aluminum is
one of the best ones I've encountered in
spite of the fact that it's a phone it's
still immaculate most brought even
brushed or anodized aluminum surfaces
every time you put them down on
something solid like a table you doesn't
want a table and make up they slide a
little bit you go scratch dude I'm sure
I just scratched it not with the one I
really didn't get that impression at all
she does get hot when she's under load
my hand got a bit sweaty the other day
when I was sitting in the car with
navigation running in the background and
I was watching a video on it so
navigation was running so that the
driver could hear the navigation things
but I was sitting watching a video she
got toasty whenever you whenever you
share your wireless network with people
it does get quite toasty but the flips
that is at least it has the aluminum
backing to help dissipate the heat so
yeah it's more hot to my hand but that
probably means my processors are
actually running cooler you know what I
actually hear something I should have
mentioned when I said I didn't miss the
the hard button here is Windows Phone
probably helped a lot as a buffer to
help me break that habit because I mean
honestly the search button is pretty
much useless I never used it the windows
button is good and the back button is
good so essentially I had two buttons
I had home and back which home and back
so it's quite possible then that was
part of the learning experience there as
well because I went from a platform with
just a home button to a platform with a
home button a useless button and a back
button to this and I haven't really used
the s for super extensively yet
HTC actually had there's some leaked
pictures that the HTC One in China is
gonna have this back piece removable
with a microSD slot you know what I
already find myself wishing I had a
microSD slot my 16 gig iPhone never used
the whole thing never found that to be a
problem this is 32 gigs I've already
almost filled it and a big part of the
reason for that is I'm shooting so much
HD video with it so much 1080p video
that I find myself filling it also it's
so much of a bigger screen it's great
for content so when I don't take
something like a Seagate wireless plus
out with me it's nice to be able to load
some videos on here and with wireless AC
I can transfer things to myself very
quickly and there's all these good
things about it that really mean I would
love to be able to throw a 64 gig
microSD in there so I I wish HTC would
reconsider and do an HTC One Plus or
something for other regions where they
implement the micro sd but I really
don't see it happening widgets are cool
but honestly I am as a user who who sees
pretty well and is used to the iOS
experience and has this great
multitasking interface where I can see
the last nine things that I've done I
didn't find myself really using any of
them it comes with a lot of stock
widgets that you can that you can add
just by going down here and you can add
a calendar and bookmarks and FM radio
and all that kind of cool I just didn't
find myself using it I prefer the
density of this interface with folders
where I can put almost everything
I need and just put it here on one page
and I'll just open up the app or and
instead of going back to the home screen
so you know like home screen home screen
to get back to the Google one going like
this to find my appropriate widget if I
just go like this most of the things
that I use a lot of the time like my
Gmail my calendar are within the last
nine things that I've used so there's
very few situations where I would need a
widget in order to make it quicker for
me to access it so there you go oh oh
and like compared to widgets I'd much
rather have things implemented into the
drop-down menu here like my power
toggles I just realized I have my Wi-Fi
off this I use all the time and this is
a very natural way for me to access it
compared to click click left left right
right or whatever else I happen to be
doing so this is something iOS users I'm
sure will appreciate is how simple it is
to set a song as your ringtone on
Android I'm sure every other platform
has been taking this for granted for
ever but as a longtime iOS user I was
like really I just like long click it
and then set to be my ringtone holy crap
that's the easiest thing ever so that
was a really neat thing to to run into
and I think at the end of the day here's
what it comes down to after my 30-day
trial yes I'm switching to Android I'm
still gonna be open to trying new
platforms such as Ubuntu phone or
blackberry actually there's a blackberry
in the mail so I might I might have to
kind of cheat on my new my new love
Android very very soon Skype integration
was much better than Windows Phone
similar to iOS so that's something that
I realize I haven't talked about yet but
there you go guys thanks for coming
along for the ride oh right I just
realized I never really did any of the
talking about galaxy s4 other than the
ruggedness of it so I think the thing
that I find most strikingly different
between TouchWiz and cents is that
TouchWiz feels very very bubbly very
happy you know it's all super bright
colors and sort of big big friendly
icons and sort of easy easy to easy to
touch whereas Sense feels more a little
more more elegant but maybe not as maybe
not as easy to use like it's really cool
the way TouchWiz already has this this
implemented so you can switch things on
and off I think the easy mode on
TouchWiz makes it the kind of thing
where I'm gonna see if I can find see if
I can find easy mode I was playing
around with it before and it's the kind
of thing where I'd go okay yeah I'm
gonna get an HTC one but if I was gonna
get a phone for my mom then I would just
give her the s4 because yeah I can't
find it right now anyway so easy mode
just basically consolidates Android down
to like a few buttons s translates
really cool I did find that smart stay
worked for me and was very helpful the
HTC One is sort of just like every other
phone where if you're reading something
for a long time
it'll dim and it'll eventually turn off
whereas that doesn't happen with the
Samsung phone I personally didn't find
the hovering above the screen and it
detecting things very helpful at all in
things like the browser
it would just be zoomed in looking at
stuff that I'm just trying to move my
finger closer to the screen I just went
no just let me touch the touchscreen and
I'm good with that what were some of the
other things that I found myself I found
myself turning off the yeah those ones
right away NFC is good
gesturing was kind of cool but it's a
very unnatural thing for me like for
example gesture gesturing to take a call
I was like oh well you just do it like
this right that didn't work and it
wasn't just one so you have to go back
and forth kind of slow and I'm looking
at it going okay so if I was driving and
I had it in a cradle or something like
that
yeah that's very practical but in
everyday use it's probably not the kind
of thing that I would use unless I
really wanted to use all the features
that came with my new phone so thank you
