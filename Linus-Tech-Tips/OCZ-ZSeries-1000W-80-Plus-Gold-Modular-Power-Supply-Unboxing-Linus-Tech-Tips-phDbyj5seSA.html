that's claim to fame is that it is the
first 80 plus gold certified power
supply that is available on the market
today so this is the ocz Zed series 1000
watt modular power supply and I guess
we'll do a quick overview of the unit
itself so it's sli ready if it's a
thousand watt power supply it better be
it has a five year warranty and this is
ok as we have the marketing stuff on the
back it is powerful efficient obviously
and it is a single rail design so a lot
of people prefer a single rail design to
a multi rail design for whatever their
reasons are but there you go it is a
single rail design capable of a peak of
1100 watt so 90 amps on that single 12
volt rail so let's get this thing opened
up and have a look at the unit itself so
it has a one hundred thirty-five
millimeter fan it has as I mentioned
before modulo calf totally run out of
stuff to talk about until we actually
get this box open here so let me just do
that we got like a shrink wrap okay
there we go that it's a very shiny gold
label oh it's got your 80 plus gold
label obviously and what 80 plus means
actually I should talk about that really
quickly is that this yeah ninety percent
efficiency so 80 plus gold is
technically ninety percent efficiency
and this unit itself is actually rated
at 50 degrees centigrade so a lot of
power supplies are actually rated for
their efficiencies and their wattages at
lower temperatures that are just kind of
unrealistic but this one is not so first
we have our manual it's a little booklet
right here it's got your index which is
your specs your installation instruction
and your connectors overview okay there
we go then we have a little cardboard
divider that separates our accessories
from the unit itself very slick looking
package here so let's get that out next
we have some velcro cable ties okay very
nice we have a very very thick three
prong standard power cable then we
a nice little oh this looks like what
you would put your your pens and pencils
in for school but this actually holds
your modular cables so why don't we have
a look at the included modular cables
here okay first of all we have what is
this okay so this is for six plus two
pin PCI Express connector so you can see
1 2 3 4 n's go into the power supply and
then the other four ends are six plus
two connectors these are kind of an ugly
color but it's in line with the gold
theme of this power supply next of all
we have I could just figure out what
these are supposed to be let me just
undo this coil here we have only one
molex connector here so that is six pins
on the one side and then it branches
into three molex connectors and one
floppy connector okay so just one of
those then next we have lots and lots of
theta so they're assuming that you're
not going to have a whole lot of molex
devices but that you might have a fair
number of SATA so we have one two three
kate three modular cables that will each
except three sigma hard drive so that's
up to nine see two hard drives just like
that and then for the hardwired cables
that are attached to the Pope for thumb
screws there you go for installing the
power supply for the hardwired cables
that are attached to the unit itself we
have a couple more six plus two pin PCI
Express connectors so that means that
you can have up to eight PCI Express
connectors sorry six PCI Express
connectors again six plus two then we
have an eps 8 pin okay so that's a 4
plus 4 then we have still more status so
you can actually hook up nine SATA
devices to this power supply without
using any adapters and another 8 pin so
this will work perfectly on a board that
needs at a pin and a four pin or even 28
pins like an x 58 classified last but
not least you have a native 24-pin
connector so this is not a 20-plus 4-pin
connector it won't work on a 20 pin
motherboard but I mean if you're
actually using a 20 pin motherboard with
a thousand
power supply you should probably be
re-evaluating your system there so this
is a very nice finish actually I really
like this it's a very um you know I
don't know how to describe it better
than this but it's a very heavy duty
feeling casing and it feels very cold to
the touch which I don't know may or may
not actually describe anything useful so
here on the back we have our on-off
switch you can see it accepts 100 to 240
volts at 50 to 60 Hertz thurs where your
three prong power plugs plugs in on the
top of the unit itself you can see we've
got the specs so 25 and 25 amps
respectively on the 3.3 and 5 volt rails
and then wow that's kind of funny the
packaging says 90 amps but this says 83
m so this is the sustained reading and I
think they were saying 90 amps peak so
there's all of your safety ratings all
that kind of stuff on either side you've
got I think it's kind of stylish-looking
you've got like a shiny gold stripe with
the Zed series thousand-watt 80 plus
gold logos all on it and then on the top
of the unit itself you've got your ocz
branded fan that is a 135 mill fan so
that's going to be very quiet and last
but not least here we go we have the
modular interface so we can do up to
four of our SATA or molex connectors and
then we can do as I mentioned before we
have another four pci express connectors
for a total of six thank you for
