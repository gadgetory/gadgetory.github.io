he mails me every once in a while going
yeah we've got more cheap Korean
monitors just like that last time we
sent to a cheap Korean monitor and a lot
of the time I'm like ah that doesn't
really look that amazing you guys not
that impressed oh not this time
I have not been able to find anything
online that is comparable to the cheap
Korean monitor deal that I have for you
guys today this is the crossover fast
144 it is a 2560 by 1440 IPS panel 144
hertz display then I will get out of the
box eventually for 299 us
okay so first things first let's have a
look at what kind of goods we get for
our 299 u.s. dollars we get a lot of
bubble wrap Wow okay we get a remote
that's weird you get a power cable we
get I love this apparently it is easier
/ cheaper for them to do this this way
they just send you an Asian power cord
and then they send you an adapter so
that you can yeah
adapt it to your North American plug not
the most elegant solution ever but hey
it gets the job done we also get a
display port cable we get a closer look
at that
remote that I alluded to before got kind
of like a little Winky like Napster guy
on there and then we get our own tool
and screws there - presumably assemble
this thing and assemble we shall this
comes in more pieces than your typical
monitor stands I like the construction
though you hear that it's a train it's
the game train to the station so the way
you orient this bad boy is you kind of
look at the marks and the angles and you
kind of line the thing and then it kind
of goes on a little something like that
ten out of ten instructions dick not
stuck inside the understanding this
feels like kind of a stupid thing to do
but I'm actually gonna set up the
monitor in front of the 65 inch OLED TV
from LG that I've got going on here the
reason being is that that's really not
actually that great for gaming so it's
nice to have other options first we got
to get the stand on here though this
also well built I will give them credit
for that but not especially outstanding
in terms of like height adjustment or
anything so you're you're definitely
giving up some
for your $2.99 144 Hertz freesync IPS
display and that is the robustness of
the stand to their credit though at
least they've got a vase amount that one
really drives me crazy when you got a
cheap stand and they didn't build in the
necessary internal reinforcements for a
third-party mount you guys want to see
me strip on camera and of course it
doesn't look perfect I've cranked that
so tight alright so there it is pretty
bare-bones if you ask me but can it make
up for it with the gaming experience to
find out we are gonna be using something
really really special now
I'm not a televangelist so I'm not gonna
give you guys the whole thing about
planting a seed of a dollar and someday
it will return to you 10,000 decks but
that is what happened today so I first
met Charles about ten years ago how
what's the safest way to take this out
of here I won't be able to pull it up
can I try whoa that's a heavy system
feels like yeah I was gonna say so I
first met Charles ten years ago on this
was back when I was building high-end
systems or at least what I thought were
high-end systems we're about to see that
redefined when I was building high-end
systems back at NCIX and I had noticed
him originally because he had all these
really expensive invoices like six
thousand dollars like regular and I'm
like dude what are you doing with all
this stuff turns out he was building
some really special systems also in
we have we we shared we shared we had
something in common right off the bat
our favorite case the Silverstone tea
jo7
anyway the first time I met him in
person he was in desperate need of a
really special set of fittings for a
thermo chiller radiator some British
standard plug that was very uncommon
even for water cooling crap ten years
ago and I actually didn't want to get
rid of them because they were they were
fairly unusual they were like even
finding nickel-plated thermo chill
fittings back then was really tough
these were really nice ones they had
ribs all the way down so they sealed
really nice and I was like you know what
Charles just for you so since then he's
actually been I mean not full-time that
he's been hard at work on what he calls
the xform @mb x2 this is a truly special
case based on the original t jo7 and he
brought this here for me a special
system that he hand-built himself in
this chassis absolutely one-of-a-kind
and we're gonna use this to power up our
monitor okay here we go so some assembly
required you guys see that totally
custom fan mounting all aluminum but I'm
not gonna like bang it together this is
not a train okay
this is this is a piece of art we're
gonna do a full showcase of this thing
down the line for now we're just going
to be using it - yes I'm gonna draw your
attention stop stop back to the monitor
back to the monitor so it's got four
HDMI ports I didn't talk about that
before one DisplayPort an audio passed
through and a DC in Jack let's go ahead
and get this baby fired up
this is pretty cool to put it mildly
like I feel like an idiot having a blue
Ethernet cable now look at this now I
have to fix everything thanks Charles
this is not a gift this is an obligation
look I said look at the monitor this
video isn't about that we're gonna do a
video about that later
stop
can't tell
Wow okay quick booth okay I gotta say
I'm glad it comes with the remote though
doesn't come with batteries so I'm gonna
have to go find some because this
buttons on the back of the monitor thing
is basically unusable I'm just trying to
adjust the brightness color effect
temperature gama ultra vivid what is
this where's just brightness look at
this hey you're supposed to be looking
at the monitor not the computer we've
been through this yeah they lost it
hella okay what is this what is or
mayshen set apparently it's what I need
because that's where brightness is and
we are back this is actually really
impressive like this is right up there
with some of the lowest motion blur that
I've seen on an IPS that and this this
machine and this monitor are match made
in heaven this thing's actually running
it over a hundred frames per second at
2560 by 1440 so if I lose it's only
because of me there is uh no excuses for
anything at this point like here you can
actually maybe even see it a little bit
here just how there's no there's no
motion blur there's no streaking behind
that I am really impressed with this
thing especially for the price like it
won't make me good at counter-strike
that's for sure but I'm still reloading
I got two guns here come on it's not
fair you did like this gaming experience
has been available for a while but now
the difference is that it's cheap I'd
like to be clear three hundred dollars
is still a lot of money but in the
context of what we would have paid for
this kind of an experience before it's
pretty affordable the only comparable
things I could find was a 144 Hertz
1440p $300 monitor on monoprice but that
was a TN panel and then for an IPS with
those specs you were paying
quite a bit more so to be clear not
everything about this thing is perfect
this menu can die in a fire I'm just
turning up the brightness a little bit
because this game is kind of kind of
dark yeah that looks that let's find out
but it's got a lot going for it I am
super impressed for 300 bucks and yeah
you can check that out of the link in
the video description while you're at it
if you guys are interested in learning a
little bit more about this beast before
we do our follow up video the case
itself is actually for sale on mod 1 so
we'll have a link to that in the
description as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
