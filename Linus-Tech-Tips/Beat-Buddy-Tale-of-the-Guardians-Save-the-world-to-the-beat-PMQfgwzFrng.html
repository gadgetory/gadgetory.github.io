brought to you by Western Digital Intel
and steelseries hey guys we're back at
the Indy mega booth to check out beat
buddy now can you explain what exactly
going on with me buddy well beat buddy
is a music action puzzler so the entire
environment is generating the music and
all the game mechanics are crucial part
of it so just by playing and mix a song
that is part of one level and kind of
live and grow with that and interact
with that kind of music one thing that I
noticed about this game is that a lot of
audio based games are super relaxing
this game while it is still relaxing has
more of the competitive component to it
where you can die a lot of audio based
games you can't really die how was it
trying to incorporate that into your
game it was really fun them at some
point we realized that I mean it's still
an action-adventure right so you want to
have all that stuff that's in an action
adventure so if you couldn't die that
would be kind of boring and we also have
like a combat situations and all these
things expect like puzzles and all that
stuff so it's a music game but it's more
in its coral and an adventure that has
like a really strong music component to
it that's how everything kind of worked
out in the end now you brought up
dialogue how exactly does a storyline
for this game work who is beat buddy
well beat body is a guardian of music so
the entire world is called symphonia he
lives in so simonia is living breathing
music so the entire world is kind of the
lifeblood of it its music and beat body
is one of three guardians who actually
are dreaming music into this world so he
wakes up at some point and realized that
two guardians are missing and
something's going wrong and that's how I
his kind of adventure starts the entire
story was as I mentioned before written
by Rhianna Pratchett so it's actually
fun story because we were trying to
write the story ourselves and we're any
so we thought like yeah we're gonna make
it somehow we didn't and we got really
lucky because she's really good friends
with awesome entry yet at the same time
we figured we need an writer she was
looking for some minor job you know like
any stuff to try her hands on and we
kind of got together and she rewritten
the entire story with
really short period where we had the
game already done it's amazing like
she's I haven't like I was i I didn't
believe that she would be able to pull
that off and she did gorgeously that's
great to hear now what do you find to be
your favorite part about this game oh I
did the artwork so my favorite part is
the art of course but to be honest like
just working on a game is so much fun I
I can't put it in words it's it's one of
the most joyful things I did in my
entire life so like artwork music like
working with coders is really
interesting because when you're nardis
and a coder kind of has a different
mindset you still have to talk a common
language the features like figuring them
out like figuring out how the music
works how to incorporate that into
gameplay and there are so many things
that are just so much fun and even like
meeting some people like cementery Orion
up wretched who did the dialogues and
working with them is also amazing and
like it's I think it's a general thing
you believe it all over the booth place
here with all in nice it's there is
nothing that that isn't fun actually
it's sometimes exhausting and sometimes
you're pissed because something doesn't
work but in the end you're just like oh
yeah I'm doing games speaking about
exhausting this guy was just like
gamescom and it's basically been doing
this for nine days straight thought I'd
just give him a throat for that um yeah
