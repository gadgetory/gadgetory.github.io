brought to you by phantom glass visit
store phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX so this is something we talked
about on the podcast we're here in the
Sony booth this is the VP LG tz1 and it
looks like what's behind me is like a TV
wall thing like super mega wide thing
but actually this is what is driving it
this is a 4k laser projector it's it's
seven inches from the wall and I'm
probably kind of not supposed to do this
but I'm like leaning over so you can see
here yes I am proving just sitting seven
inches from the wall projecting a 147
inch image one of the most impressive
things about it is the fact that it uses
a very non-traditional projector system
so it's actually laser projection which
does a couple of things it gives it
better contrast better color vibrancy it
also gives it better performance in very
dirty environments I mean dirty in the
sense of there's a lot of different
light sources all over the place here in
the hall and even in this completely on
ideal environment it looks absolutely
fantastic
it supports four HDMI 2.0 inputs so yes
PC gamers running gtx 980 s you can hook
your graphics card up to this you can
game at 4k 60fps on a massive wall
assuming you have the $55,000 and the
what was it five to six weeks or so that
you need to wait to get sony to custom
build one of these they're built to
order in Japan I don't think I've missed
anything critical at this point other
than the fact that the solution you see
behind you is actually running two of
them if I move to the side you can see
there's two and the gentleman over there
is actually holding a tablet that allows
him to dynamically switch between
different content sources all over the
place so the application here is not
just in extremely high-end homes but
let's say you know an art gallery that
wants to build a ginormous video wall
and have a simple tablet interface
system to show different things move
them around all like that very very cool
stuff and another benefit of the laser
projection system is that you won't see
any diminishing in the brightness of it
until 50,000 hours so to put that in
perspective that's eight hours a day of
watch
TV or gaming for 15 years when you
compare that to a traditional projector
bulb that's going to last maybe a
handful of thousands of hours and is
significantly dimmer even a couple
thousand hours in this could be the last
projector or TV you ever buy mind you if
you got fifty five grand to drop on a TV
then you probably buy another one later
anyway and you know give that to your
grandkids or something now this is a fun
demo I've never seen a TV this thin and
probably a most people haven't it's only
four point seven millimeters thick this
is Sony's new 900 series it's available
in 55inch 65inch it's a 4k display it's
an edge lit LED backlit LCD and I mean
really the claim to fame here is how
phenomenally thin it is but not only
that but how well it's it actually
integrates into being used because super
thin TVs have been done before
but not always in a way that's
particularly smart so first of all the
way it mounts to the wall is pretty darn
unique it actually comes with a system
that goes into your stud and then the TV
has kind of a bar that screws into the
thicker part of the base it's only about
half of the TV that's four point seven
millimeters thick I mean it just
compromises that you have to make
physics and and whatnot but you screw in
this bar and then you actually just hook
it on to the wall where it sits so close
against the wall that it's only about
how far is it looks like about two and a
half centimeters yeah it's about two and
a half centimeters away from the wall
now of course when you do that you might
have issues with cable management and
sound so cable management they take care
of with a little cable door so you've
got your standard four HDMI 2.0 inputs
you got your land because it is a smart
TV happens to be running Android TV
which is pretty freakin cool because I
for one am totally sick of TV makers
trying to make their own paying every
time and not just going with something
standard that actually has support so
you can have you know chromecast II type
functionality you can play Android games
all that kind of cool stuff
yeah that's built right into your TV and
then the other thing is sound so instead
of just firing sound down out of a
speaker firing sound into the wall
heaven forbid I mean rear mounted
speakers are bad enough on a phone
nevermind you do that on your TV they've
actually got like a flap baffle system
that enables the speakers to kind of
fire this way and then deflect the sound
toward the viewer with that said if
you're going to
TV this awesome I would definitely
recommend going ahead and getting a nice
sound system to go along with it now
this is actually the same TV we were
just looking at a second ago but the
difference is that instead of having
content playing on it they've got a very
early build of their Android TV
operating system running on this
particular model now something that I
actually had been asking about
off-camera as we walked over here is
okay well are you guys positioning
Android TV as this like super high-end
feature oh you have to buy the most
expensive model to get it and the answer
is no apparently 90% of Sony's TVs for
2015 are going to feature an Android OS
on them and not in the same way that
we've seen you know Android powered TV
devices done in the past with a low
powered processors the x1 processor that
I mentioned does 4k upscaling before
they're also saying is well that's just
pretty darn good for running just about
anything in fact for the kinds of things
that you might want to do on a smart TV
let's say launch a Netflix movie stream
they're claiming that they can go from
zero to movie playing in under a minute
whereas their competitors are looking at
up to multiple minutes due to the speed
of the process and this is something
that's been a real frustration for me
for a long time if it's all this
functionality that it supposedly has but
the hardware is too slow to take
advantage of it anyway so there's 16
gigs of on-board storage I don't know if
they're quoting how much memory how much
RAM there is onboard or anything like
that they won't give me any details
about the x1 other than that yeah it's
like blazing fast and super awesome but
one thing that I can do I got to like I
stole the remote from the guy here so I
can do a quick demo of how you would
control an Android TV as if you guys
don't already know if you're super smart
- tech tips
yeah dog there we go so a bunch of my
videos just like that super fast but
you're not locked into using the remote
you can actually use an Android or an
iOS device to control it and I think
that's pretty much it's extremely
exciting to see this kind of thing
finally get standardized instead of
being that horrible proprietary nonsense
I mean Android is a popular operating
system for a reason and the familiarity
that you're already going to have with a
Google search and Google now like
interface is going to help a lot with
the learning curve that most people are
just slamming into like a brick wall
when it comes to trying to operate a
smart TV so I think that's pretty much
it for Sony TVs here at CES 2015 I do
want to do a call up for our sponsors so
number one is phantom glass these guys
make the best darn screen protectors out
there they go on without bubbles
guaranteed even I can do it it takes
like 20 seconds due to the nano coating
on the bottom of them they're made of
Gorilla Glass 3 so they're going to have
the same clarity scratch resistance and
just general awesomeness that nice feel
on your thumb as the glass that's
already on your phone and they're
reasonably priced and available for a
variety of devices you can check them
out on store phantom glass and also
showed up for HyperX those guys are
awesome they've got a bunch of great
gaming content on their YouTube channel
