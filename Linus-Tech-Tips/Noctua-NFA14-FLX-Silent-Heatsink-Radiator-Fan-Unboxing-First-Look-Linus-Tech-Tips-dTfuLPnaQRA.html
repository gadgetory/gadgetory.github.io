of not too a fan so I'm super excited to
check out the NFPA 14 FLX now as you
know we've got a wide variety of
different 120 millimeter cooling fans
available from Noctua including their
f-series and their p series which are
optimized for radiators and heat sinks
because they're very pressure optimized
with the f-series the f12 actually
having a directed cyclone of air coming
away from the exhaust side of it now
this doesn't have that functionality but
this is a 140 millimeter version of what
would be very similar to a p12 fan but
with some additional technology so if
you come in here and have a look at the
actual features that are available on it
we've got a square 140 millimeter frame
this makes it ideal for case in Riyadh
yes well you can see nakta web puts
right here what it's for case and
radiator cooling flow acceleration
channels AAO frames depth Inlet design
inner surface microstructure so
integrated Eddy vibration pad smooth
commutation Drive - basically what
knocked was trying to say is their
drives are engineered to the point of it
being kind of obsessive so come in here
and have a look at the fan itself and
the accessories so unlike the 120
millimeter fans the 140 male fans come
with not only a low noise adapter low
noise adapter right there which I've
down volts the fan to seven volts but
also an ultra hold on a second okay well
one of these is ultra-low noise one of
them is low noise so one of them seven
volts and one of them is 5 volts also
comes with a molex to 3 pin adapter very
nicely sleeve all of them right up to
the connector so you're not going to see
any unsightly colored wires we've also
got extension cables did this is
fantastic
tape just a simple three pin extension
cable mounting screws although usually
you won't use those you'll use the
rubber isolating anti vibration mounts I
mean you can though because you've got
more anti vibration mounts here the only
problem with using the metal screws is
because they have to drive into hard
plastic and they will transfer some
vibration to the case that way
even with these rubber isolators so if
you use these rubber isolators up
against the case with these rubber
Isolators bridging the hard plastic with
the hard metal of the case itself then
you've got no room for vibration to be
transferred from the fan to the chassis
when it's spinning not to say that not
to a fans actually create a whole ton of
vibration when they're spinning because
they really don't the fans all come with
short cables love this because it means
that no matter where you install them I
mean really in a case is only so big
usually where you install it there's
going to be a fan header somewhere
nearby if there isn't they've included
the extension that you need to run it
wherever it needs to go that makes it
more like a normal fan wire length love
this - check this out this is a newer
feature that they've started adding to
their fans see these right here I
couldn't figure out what they were for
at first I thought they were just for
sort of mounting the the rubber noise
Isolators then what I realized is these
are probably for cable management check
this out so whenever you you know when
you wrap a wire around the outside of a
fan maybe they're not for that but
whatever you can use them for that all
you got to do is put them under these
little rubber pieces and they will
generally stay there very very cool
stuff like you know when you take a fan
and you mount it kind of like here at
the back your chassis then you want to
wrap it here down to here and then run
it to a little bit awesome for that so I
want you have a closer look at these
rubber Isolators you can remove them if
you want you don't have to keep them on
you know say in the odd case that it
causes some kind of a compatibility
issue with your case or your cooler or
anything like that you don't have to
worry about it
so let's have a look at some of the
technologies that Noctua built into the
fan number one is the six year warranty
um so basically what they're saying is a
hundred and fifty thousand hours or
something like that is the mean time
between failure for this thing and yeah
there you go mean time between failure
of greater than 150 thousand hours so
they're pretty much saying yeah it's not
going to die but if it does we'll deal
with it without adapters it runs at 1200
rpm with an adapter this is the wrong
fan with an adapter this one also runs
at 1200 rpm but low noise adapters at
1050 ultra-low noise at 900 rpm so at
900 rpm this thing will be darn near
silent
alright technology-wise these guys right
here these stepped inlets apparently
reduced the amount of noise that is here
we go stepped Inlet design step down let
designers advanced aerodynamic design to
blah blah blah blah first with the f12
the f12 was one of the most advanced
fans ever by adding turbulence to the
influx facility it's the transition from
laminar to turbulent flow so similar to
the dimpled structure of the golf ball
leads to better flow attachment to the
frame which allows the impeller to suck
in more air and helps improve overall
air efficiency we also use a very
advanced bearing that is completely
sealed so you won't get any micro dust
inside they use flow accelerator
channels on the blades themselves which
is youth game there's lots of
complicated stuff here generally
speaking I am NOT an aerodynamic
engineer I think you guys know this
you've watched enough of my videos to
know that that's not the case what I do
know is that these fans are extremely
well regarded even by those who have
very advanced advanced equipment for
testing fans I know this because I spent
some time using their equipment testing
Noctua fans and they were just like yeah
they're really good sense they're just
really good I do know that they last
over the long term I've been using
Noctua fans for a very long time on some
of my quiet optimized systems and what I
also know is that they're darn silent
now guys there's more to it than just
the RPM the CFM and the static pressure
and the decibel ratings there's more to
it than that there's how gracefully does
it undervolt
so some fans yes you can undervolt them
but they start to develop a grind or a
tic that doesn't necessarily get picked
up by a decimeter so yeah you know it's
there's an audible noise but it's more
about how annoying is that noise not to
a fans don't make annoying noises they
you know sure maybe they look kind of
distinctive but that's their branding
you can always tell a knock to a fan
when you see it so this guy right here
perfect for radiators perfect for heat
sinks oh yeah why is it perfect for
radiators good question because knock
twat has 140 and 150 millimeter fans
that use a round frame which is not good
for radiators because you'll lose the
seal around the edges and in the corners
like that which causes it to be less
efficient this way the fan gets to go
right up against this is
120ml Adam just using it for
illustration purposes gets to go right
up against it and causes a seal so that
pressure optimized design actually gets
to push air through the fins of the rad
or the heatsink rather than worrying
about it spilling around the edges you
can see an example of where this
wouldn't matter in this computer right
here come on in closer because here
we're going to have leaks around the
edges no matter what so as long as we
have reasonably good directed airflow
through the fins we're going to be fine
so you could use something like they're
a 15 instead of they're a 14 it wouldn't
be necessary to have that square shaped
fan arrangement
so let's just make sure we don't miss
any of the other technologies that
include so we got the flow acceleration
chance with the advanced acoustic
optimization frame stepped in in their
surface microstructures
so these flow separation from the
suction sides which produce an reduced
blade passing noise and improved air
flow and pressure efficiency the
anti-vibration pads we covered running
smoothness by eliminating torque
variations and switching noises this is
actually something that's that's really
good to know about so guys the circuitry
and the design of the of the fan motor
as well as the PWM are actually these
aren't PWM fans but they do have pwn
fans these guys are makes a huge
difference in using third-party fan
controllers on fans so the more
optimized it is and the more of all the
higher quality of the components that
are used the less likely you are to
develop any sort of weird vibrations
ticking or whining noises hey 3 speeds
ultra-low power consumption and six-year
warranty metal bearing shell so plus the
highest possible degree of manufacturing
precision minimum tolerance excellent
long serviceability CNC milled bearing
shell made entirely from rest okay so
there you go quality fans yeah they're
expensive but you get what you pay for
