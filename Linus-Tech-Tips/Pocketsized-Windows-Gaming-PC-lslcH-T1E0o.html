are we making it who could possibly care
and fight as this product exists this is
the GPD win it is a windows-based one of
those translators that all the Korean
kids in class use to cheat on their
spelling tests in theory it's a gaming
device it has a gamepad built in but it
runs an Intel Cherry Trail processor
with onboard graphics meaning is it
capable of gaming well there's really
only one way to find out by watching
this video also you could just read
discussion about it on reddit but you're
here at this video now you might as well
keep going
d fuel is the sugar free alternative
energy beverage to maintain focus and
endurance over long days and gaming
sessions save some money using code
Lynas at the link in the video
description so let's start with what the
heck is this thing inside the box you
get oh that's my Windows 10 key don't
worry too much about that but you get
the GPD win you get some ripoff Apple
earpods go ahead and take a look at
those while I open up the other crap
that's in here you get a USB type-c
cable there you go looks a little
something like that you get a USB
charger it's a two and a half amp fun
fact this thing will lose charge during
heavy use and by heavy use I mean
downloading games in steam it will lose
charge on a 2 amp device so you're going
to want to use that puppy if you want to
game for you know more than a few hours
at a time on it and you get these
instructions most of which are in
English but not all on the other side
they are now ok so let's have a look at
what we're dealing with here we've got a
air exhaust
we've got intake apparently they're both
intakes which is actually not how that
works but sure GPD we've got a fan
switch off low and high I'd recommend
high it's really not that loud that's
right up to my mic not that bad
you got a couple of speaker ports here
and then not a whole lot else going on
around the bottom except oh look at that
more i/o than the netbook how shocking
so we've got a type-c connector that's
for charging we've got a mini HDMI we've
got a microSD slot see that wasn't so
hard look how thin that is Apple look
how thin that is is that that hard to
put on your device yeah I thought so
alright we've gone a type-a connector so
that's USB 3 going by the color and a
headset jack so it's your microphone
headphone combo jack also yes my friends
l1 r1 l2 and l1 buttons because this is
a freaking
gaming device sort of I guess let's go
ahead and oh no no how do I jump over
him I don't remember anymore
oh there we go that's right that's how
Batman jumps look at that I'm running
Batman Arkham Asylum at 39 frames per
second and we dip down to 34 in a fight
scene sometimes it goes all the way down
to a cinematic 24 but really it's not
that bad so let's have a look at what
they've got over here they've got a
d-pad they've got a couple of joysticks
they've got an ABX while check that out
emulation much they've also got
PlayStation logos on the buttons there
so you don't get confused when you're
playing oh I don't know say for example
Final Fantasy 7 and you're trying to
play on like a PC controller it's all
like ok March along with the other guys
in the band press X plus triangle like
which one's X I've never played on a
Playstation in my life ah what else we
got here full keyboard as well as some
exhilarating but ins here including
starts yeah pause before you hit me
right there start select print screen l
three are three volume up and volume
down dedicated button for that
definitely thumbs up they're an Xbox
button and power but what are the
capabilities like I mean I guess I just
showed you but it does more hold on so
that's a surprisingly good gaming
experience I mean sure it's an older
triple-a title but the fact that it runs
it all on something this size is pretty
darn impressive and even more so it's
got a 6700 milliamp hour battery which
resulted in about 20% of it being lost
in the time that we were playing the
game not too bad and not every game is
going to be as intensive as you know
something like Batman Arkham Asylum so
let's say you wanted to fire up the old
emulator I'm actually pretty impressed
again our land who doesn't need healing
anyway because he's like a badass but
whatever check this out
Final Fantasy Tactics running on ePSXe
anywhere from 30 to 60 FPS somewhere in
that range
which is frankly good enough for this
kind of experience that's right Auto
potion bitches you just did like 18
damage so gaming wise I'm actually
pretty darn impressed so far it's got 64
gigs of emmc storage 4 gigs of RAM
meaning you've got a pretty decent spec
computer in your hands so then of course
you know the next step for me is what
about not gaming this is actually where
it stood out to me even more because
you've got your D and X input modes for
the gamepad then you've got this mouse
mode in the middle that's actually
surprisingly intuitive to use so the
right stick becomes a mouse and remember
you've also got a touchscreen so you're
not like limited to just waiting for
this to move around as you you know
browse forums or whatever else the case
may be left and right click are handled
by the shoulder buttons back there and
this left one here is now scroll it is
shockingly intuitive to use and actually
very pleasant as long as you can you
have decent vision because text is not
very big and given this is a five and a
half inch 720p screen as soon as you try
to scale anything within windows you're
going to end up with a lot of usability
problems like bringing up Windows that
have all the buttons cut off on the
right at the bottom which is far from my
only complaint the wobble on the
shoulder buttons in particular however
quality the switches under them might be
is at the very borderline of what I
would consider to be intact let alone
acceptable and I ran into a very
interesting bug maybe it's unique to my
unit but I kind of doubt it this is
pre-production to be very very clear
where while I'm plugged in and charging
I can't actually boot up the device I
have to unplug boot it throw it back in
and then I can use it while I charge
practically speaking though none of that
stuff really changes the usability of
the device that much and there are a
shocking number of ways to use it
so right now I've actually mixed things
up and I'm using steam in-home streaming
to stream this game off of a computer
upstairs that's how I'm running rocket
League at a solid 60 frames per second
with no dips whatsoever at the highest
quality pretty freakin cool and made
possible by the fact that they didn't
cheap out on those little things that
you often see on cheapo handheld devices
like dual band Wi-Fi
and another interesting use case while I
don't necessarily agree with the
optimism that GPD has about you know how
great it is as a Productivity device is
getting actual work done because the
TeamViewer experience is frankly not
that great from a phone and being able
to remote in and use a computer with a
mouse and keyboard is a pretty
compelling use case one that my wife
brought up almost immediately when she
looked at it so I guess all that's
really left then is the conclusion is it
worth the price of admission which is
somewhere between 350 to 400 US dollars
for something that in essence is a
fatter clunkier Nintendo DS that runs a
full Windows 10 operating system which
kind of blew my mind and the answer is
up to you
personally I wouldn't buy one but what
this does make me excited for is the
future of hyper mobile devices like this
when they get just a little bit more
powerful like it feels kind of like the
iPhone to me is it as revolutionary as
the iPhone no to be very clear but it's
kind of like the iPhone to me where it's
like hey there's this like great idea
but like it's kind of not that great
right now but stay tuned like five years
from now it's going to be awesome that's
what I feel this is like let me know in
the comments below if you agree or if
you think I totally missed the mark so
if you're not familiar with mass drop
they're a community where users discuss
products they're interested in buying
and then mass drops all like whoo you
guys want to buy that okay they go and
talk to the manufacturer they negotiate
a bulk order at a discounted price and
bam all those people get a lower price
the manufacturer gets to sell a bunch of
units and mass drop sits in the middle
today's drop is the noble X ie NS they
are made in the USA and they offer a
great sound signature with a midnight
blue anodized faceplate and a detachable
cable and they ship with two pairs of
silicone ear tips two foam ear tips one
pair of silicone ear tips presumably
this will make sense visually a cleaning
tool a carrying case and a warranty from
noble audio they got no
right in the name what are the odds they
don't honor it right now selling for to
$49.99 u.s. dollars with free domestic
shipping in the u.s. check that out at
the link in the video description so I
think that pretty much wraps it up if
you guys dislike this video go ahead and
hit that dislike button but if you liked
it hit the like button get subscribed
maybe even consider checking out the
where to buy link in the video
description for the stuff we featured
today also linked in the video
description is our merch store which my
coolest which you can buy a cool shirt
where you can buy a cool shirt like this
one and our community forum which you
should totally join I think that's it
right we have other videos you should
watch them we'll have a thing there will
be pretty</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
