unboxing this is the Kingston
DataTraveler 101 it is rated for up to
10 megabytes per second read and 5
megabytes per second ride ride alright
so this is a value USB Drive it's gonna
be all about cost per gigabyte
they provide a convenient scissor line
for how to open the packaging but since
I am rarely equipped with scissors or a
knife I'm gonna go ahead and open it
with my hands it is compatible with
Windows 7 Windows Vista Windows XP
Windows 2000 Mac OS X as well as Linux
and then here's what I can't figure out
look at this okay they have a graph with
data traveller as well as you are drive
do they mean your drive like your
current Drive I'm not quite sure what
they mean well if you have some insight
into what Kingston means on the back of
their box by your drive then yeah please
do let me know so let's have a look at
the data traveller 101 itself you can
see it has an included cap you can
actually install a little carrier string
right there through the top it's made
out of metal which appears to be pretty
decent metal so it's not gonna just come
right off like one of the other drives
that I had that had a metal clip on it
alright you just flip it open like that
and then you are able to access the USB
business end of the data traveller 101
so that was it that's the whole thing
let's do a quick let's do a quick data
write test just to find out exactly how
well it performs and then that will
conclude our data traveller 101 coverage
so as soon as we plugged in the USB key
your drive revealed itself to be your
USB world just the way you want to
experience the fun of your drive anytime
anywhere you can manage your files and
folders download and use fun apps
subject to availability store and play
your favorite songs explore your photos
and explore your photos with friends and
family so we clicked the learn more link
it looks like we've got built-in secure
internet browser with search by Yahoo
two gigs of online backup account
we have a RoboForm password manager as
well as a your app zone 2 to get easy
access to additional apps so there's a
bunch of instruction videos there's an
intro video which is a cartoon and it's
conveniently captioned so we can even
watch it
I just finished another thrilling day of
work carrying files around Wow
here I think we've got sound even
that's okay
okay so basically it's a software that
allows you to make better use of your
drive overall with all of these cool
features that's pretty neat search
online for Spanish listen to my built-in
internet browser huh so I guess it's
bootable even neat this is getting kind
of long okay let's do our let's do our
speed test really quick here so I'm
gonna take our tech tips video and I'm
going to paste it and we'll find out how
long it takes so this is a 100 megabyte
file and it takes approximately that
long which is a lot faster than five
megabytes per second which is what the
drive is ready for so it looks like
Houston is under reading this Drive
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at Kingston DataTraveler
