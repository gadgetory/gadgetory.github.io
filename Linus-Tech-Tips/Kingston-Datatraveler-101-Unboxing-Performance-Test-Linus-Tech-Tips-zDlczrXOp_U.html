unboxing this is the kingston
datatraveler 101 it is rated for up to
10 megabytes per second read and five
megabytes per second ride ride alright
so this is a value USB Drive it's going
to be all about cost per gigabyte they
provide a convenient scissor line for
how to open the packaging but since I am
rarely equipped with scissors or a knife
I'm going to go ahead and open it with
my hands it is compatible with windows 7
windows vista windows XP windows 2000
mac OS x as well as linux and then
here's what i can't figure out look at
this okay they have a graph with data
traveler as well as you r dr do they
mean your drive like your current drive
i'm not quite sure what they mean well
if you have some insight into what
kingston means on the back of their box
by your drive then yeah please do let me
know so let's have a look at the data
traveler 101 itself you can see it has
an included cap you can actually install
a little carrier string right there
through the top it's made out of metal
which appears to be pretty decent metal
so it's not going to just come right off
like one of the other drives that i had
that had a metal clip on it alright you
just flip it open like that and then you
are able to access the USB business end
of the data traveler 101 so that was it
that's the whole thing let's do a quick
let's do a quick data right test just to
find out exactly how well it performs
and then that will conclude our data
traveler 101 coverage so as soon as we
plugged in the USB key your drive
revealed itself to be your USB world
just the way you want to experience the
fun of your drive anytime anywhere you
can manage your files and folders
download and use fun app subject to
availability store and play your
favorite songs explore your photos and
explore your photos with friends and
family so we clicked the learn more link
it looks like we've got built-in secure
internet browser with search by yahoo
two gigs of online backup account
we have a robo forum password manager as
well as a your app zone 2 to get easy
access to additional apps so there's a
bunch of instruction videos there's an
intro video which is a cartoon and it's
conveniently captioned so we can even
watch it I just finished another
thrilling day of work carrying files
around Wow here I think we got sound
even
that's okay
okay so basically it's a software that
allows you to make better use of your
drive overall with all of these cool
features that's pretty neat search
online for Spanish listen to my built-in
internet browser huh so I guess it's
bootable even need this is getting kind
of long okay let's do our let's do our
speed test really quick here so I'm
going to take our tech tips video and
I'm going to paste it and we'll find out
how long it takes so this is a 100
megabyte file and it takes approximately
that long which is a lot faster than 5
megabytes per second which is what the
drive is right before so it looks like
Kingston is under reading this Drive
