did send one of these for free to the
cameraman so this is his iPhone 4 I
don't know if you guys recall or not but
my iPhone 4 actually has like a carbon
fiber wrap on it that I installed myself
and was able to resolve my issues with
reception because of Nam not bridging
the two antennas anymore and the
cameraman had to get a case for much the
same reason actually he doesn't even
have reception at his house
hahaha so much for for Apple being so
great I should like beat him up or
something or make fun of him on YouTube
for making me buy an iPhone 4 mind you
mine my reception issues aren't as bad
as his because honestly here in Richmond
anyway I hear all of the Rogers guys
complaining about their iPhone 4
reception but my Bell iPhone actually
isn't that bad so there you go so here
is actually I think this is a shot of
the camera man's view outside his window
at his apartment so there you go that is
what it looks like out the camera man's
apartment so if it looks the same out
your apartment then you're probably a
neighbor of the camera man's and so
there we have the bumper case installed
you see we have easy access unlike most
of the OEM or aftermarket poo coolers
unlike most of the aftermarket cases it
has actual built-in buttons that just
press the buttons underneath instead of
a gap for your own buttons and then the
vibrate switch is right there which you
can reach through to now going along the
side you got little speaker holes you
got a pull for the power jack you got
the other side you've got your unlock
button your headphones and you still got
the back of the iPhone just like that
now personally I like the carbon fiber
look of my own sticker case and I don't
like the bulkiness in this although it's
not nearly as bad as the one the
cameraman was using before anyway
burn on you cameraman for having to use
a bumper case with your iPhone 4 because
the reception sucks
