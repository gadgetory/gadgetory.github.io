your performance your size and your
quietness and the general rule is you
can pick two so you can have a really
powerful small PC that sounds like a
quadcopter under load or you can have a
powerful silent thing that takes up your
entire desk that is until today Compu
lab claims to have hit the trifecta and
this is the air top a small and powerful
and completely silent gaming grade
machine this video is brought to you by
Mack Weldon Mack Weldon believes in

compared to other passive computers that
we've seen in the past the Compu lab err
top is tiny but that doesn't mean that
it's lacking in features it's actually
got more i/o than some full-size
desktops that we've looked at including
a total of seven display outputs and
three serial ports if you're into that
and it doesn't mean that it's light
fully loaded the err top is close to 14
pounds and there's a good reason for
that covering both sides of the machine
are these thick heatsink
fins that are somehow supposed to
dissipate all of the heat that's created
by the impressive internals like
seriously inside this thing there is a
workstation option with pro grade stuff
but our G model sports an Intel Core i7
7700 and NVIDIA GTX 1060 32 gigs of ram
and a total of 3 terabytes of
solid-state storage but it has no fans
how does it stay cool I don't know but
it does after 2 hours of full synthetic
load our processor only reached 70
degrees Celsius with our GPU reaching a
warm but totally acceptable 80 degrees
and the casing didn't get too hot to
touch either and this is cool if you
ever concerned about how toasty things
are getting there's a handy-dandy
display on the front of the computer
that can show you your CPU temps your
CPU clock speed and a bunch of other
useful stuff although it should be noted
that the GPU temp sensor does not seem
to be very accurate and there are some
other imperfections as well our CPU did
not turbo very hard or for very long
staying at around 3.3 gigahertz for the
majority of our tests which raise the
question is this going to hurt its
performance in games
well because games typically don't
utilize all four course the way that a
stress test would it actually managed to
stay around 4.1 gigahertz throughout our
testing and only reached about 45
degrees running 3dmark times
now it did still lose to our open-air
bench that had the same specs but it was
only just by a little bit like we can
see right here our GPU clock is at over
1800 megahertz even though we're running
passive cooling okay so at this point in
the video we could just say it's magic
neat huh
but that is not the LTTE way so we've
got our workspace ready and our tools
out preparing for a complicated teardown
process to find out just how this thing
really it's bad easy okay so then with
the panel open there were a few things
that we noticed in here number one is
that the inside is separated into two
thermal zones so the right cooling plate
makes contact with the CPU which is on
the opposite side of the motherboard and
also through this thermal pad that's
revealed under the drive cage handles
cooling for the up to oh and by the way
that's the second thing we notice for
the up to seven drives that you can put
in this thing a single PCIe X 2 m dot 2
2 PCIe x4 M 2 s and up to 4 2 and a half
inch SATA drives then while you're in
there you can throw in a Wi-Fi card here
a SIM card here another SIM card here a
microSD a mini PCIe card and up to 64
gigs of standard-size memory
Wow it's got a lot of expansion leading
us to the last thing we noticed the GTX
1060 graphics card other than having
non-standard mounting holes that appear
to have been drilled through the PCB and
a resaw turned 6 pin power connector
that is now 4 pins is just an
off-the-shelf EVGA card meaning that
theoretically you could upgrade it in
the future if you found a physically
compatible board or you could actually
just remove the side panel with the GPU
attached and replace it with a next-gen
wall something that they plan on selling
as an upgrade any
since we're looking at the video card
let's finally get to how this cooling
system works this massive hunk of copper
makes contact with the GPU and has a
large heat pipe underneath it this heat
pipe is on top of another heat pipe that
spreads across two more heat pipes which
go over almost the whole area of the
side panel allowing the entire thing to
efficiently dissipate heat once hot
these square channels cause natural
convection moving the heat energy away
from the computer so once all is said
and done each side is capable of
dissipating about a hundred watts for a
total of 200 it's well thought out and
well executed and the way it's built
makes it feel more like a a piece of
equipment and less like a computer but
of course with great engineering comes
great cost and the air top is no
exception with our config coming in at
an eye-watering 3700 u.s. dollars now if
you can deal with a bit less storage and
memory the gtx 1060 model can be had for
as little as 2,500 which given the low
volume and highly customized nature of
this product seems reasonably fair so
then if you're looking for a gaming
machine that can deliver a solid v are
capable experience or a powerhouse
workstation that is small enough to
carry in a shoulder bag and is
completely silent the compy lab our top
looks like a great choice then again if
all of that sounds pretty good but you
still want more than currently in the
works is the inferno a similar passively
cooled gaming system
this time with a 7700 K and a freaking
GTX 1080
although before that goes into
production they're gonna be gauging
interest with Kickstarter which is
probably a good idea given the
presumably very small audience with that
kind of exact requirements and the money
for it but you know what isn't that
expensive tunnel bear tunnel bear is the
