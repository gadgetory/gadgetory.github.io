brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with corsair Memory and
western digital welcome to the Samsung
booth folks were here with the crown
jewel of their display here at CES which
happens to also be a display this is a
21 by nine UHD TV it is a hundred and
five inches diagonally making it the
largest and the most curved LCD display
available now it's when I say available
I mean available only to people at
Samsung where they might have a handful
of them for trade shows just like this
because we don't have any confirmation
in terms of exactly when it's coming
maybe sometime later this year but
details are still kind of sketchy they
just wanted to show it off because hey
they can make this thing which is
absolutely amazing now it's not a 4k UHD
display instead it actually has more
than five thousand pixels horizontally
which means that because these standards
are not a hundred percent ratified
someone buying this TV just like someone
buying you know an HDMI 1.4 TV last year
with the update to hdmi 2.0 way might
feel kind of insecure is it okay to buy
something like this without knowing if
the standards are even going to be
supportable don't worry with Samsung's
one connect technology they actually are
using an external box for connectivity
as well as signal processing which
allows you to just upgrade it once the
standards are completely ratified now
you might be wondering to yourself what
exactly what I want a 21 by nine display
for and the answer is most definitely
movies with a smaller display and we've
been walking around the show floor a
fair bit curved maybe doesn't make quite
as much of a difference but with the
large one like this where you're really
replicating the field of view of a
theater within your home having each
part of the screen an equal distance
from your I can make a significant
difference to the viewing experience
this is much the same reason why when
you go there this is for the same reason
that when you go to a theater the
display looks natural even though it is
so large so we're going to be moving
along here shortly I think someone's
actually trying to get past us but it
looks absolutely phenomenal in person
next up we're here with the Galaxy Note
pro this is the 12
point two inch version but it's also
available in 8.4 and 10.1 inch versions
this one's got a quad-core processor
it's got three gigs of ram of course I
mean it's a note series so it's going to
be pretty darn high end it's got a nice
slim form factor it's actually not too
heavy although it's hard to gauge with
this security device on the back
speaking of the back it has a pleasing
sort of leather ish feeling plastic much
like the note 3 but of course the
business is mostly in the front it has a
massive 12.2 inch as I mentioned before
2560 x 1440 display this makes it great
for watching movies but also due to its
size great for taking notes because it
is approximately the same size as an
eight and a half by 11 standard sheet of
notetaking paper now of course a note
device is not just about the hardware
it's also about the software so we see a
lot of carryovers including an included
stylus that tucks away on the side from
the note 3 you've got Samsung's air drop
functionality so you just hover the pan
over the display and then press the
button and you can go ahead and select a
bunch of different stuff you can draw a
little window if you need a calculator
you want to watch video or something
like that with the supported
applications and it makes multitasking a
little bit easier than with many other
Android devices thanks to TouchWiz now
here's a new one that I haven't actually
seen before if you swipe in from the
right and then instead of just clicking
on one of the applications if you hold
it and drag you can configure up to four
different applications in a screen
sharing mode that will make working on
things quite efficient especially if you
move from one to another and back and
forth and so forth now I did that
slightly wrong there I think oh I think
this one doesn't work that way so let's
go ahead and grab contacts here there we
go so we're going to split this up four
ways actually we'll just do it three
ways and then check this out guys you
can actually move around the divisions
so if you want to have a nice long
column for your emails you can have that
and then you can see more of your video
thumbnails if you want to see more of
your contacts over here you just move
that around dynamically it's incredibly
cool and it integrates seamlessly with
the other features so I could still
views airdrop till you know like grab a
little calculator or something like that
now a device like this is not just for
play it's also for work so we're going
to go ahead and show you guys their new
software that is I guess meant to
compete
things like windows RT's inclusion of
microsoft office or Apple's inclusion of
productivity software with their devices
now so check this out we're going to
swipe open from the right Oh hold on
come in from the right here and this is
hand calm so you've got cell show and
word which are of course going to be
spreadsheets presentations and then
typing so we're going to go ahead and
open one of these bad boys check that
out they off there are claiming it's
ninety percent compatible Microsoft Word
so unless you're using some of the more
obscure features things will open up
correctly even if you're saving them and
then opening them back and forth between
devices and because of the size okay
that's a normal keyboard this is pretty
cool guys I'm going to go ahead and I'm
going to close a bunch of other things
and we're going to open up the hand calm
word so H word in full screen maximize
that and check this out you've got
almost about the size of a laptop
keyboard on here it's not super easy to
type on I made a few quite a few
mistakes at the beginning but with a
little bit of practice it would
definitely be faster than trying to type
with just two thumbs so you kind of go
okay Linus that's great there's a lot of
productivity stuff here that sounds
fantastic but what if I can't take this
thing to work because my office doesn't
allow people to bring their own devices
don't worry it is fully Samsung Knox
compliance so you've got all the
encryption features that you need if you
need to access VPNs off-site or whatever
else the case may be so it's definitely
meant to be both entertainment and
productivity thanks for checking out our
coverage of the Samsung booth here at
CES 2014 don't forget our trip to the
show is powered by NCI XCOM as well as
Corsair and western digital a huge
thanks to those guys because without
them we would not have been able to be
here</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
