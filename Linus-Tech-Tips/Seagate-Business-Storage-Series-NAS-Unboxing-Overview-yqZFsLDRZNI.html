to spare you guys unboxing a couple of
network-attached storage devices from
Seagate but this is their new business
storage line we've got a couple of
different configs here so the first one
is their to Bay 4 terabyte with drives
ones and that would make sense to me in
the past whenever you've bought an as
from a hard drive company whether it's
Seagate or one of their competitors or
whoever else it's always had drives in
it Seagate is now offering their NASA's
without drives so this one right here is
a 4 beta that looks to go up against the
likes of guys like a Synology or kuna or
any other standalone ass manufacturer so
what does Seagate bring to the market
that they think is so special I'll tell
you what and actually I'm kind of sold
now with that said these are not
necessarily priced at consumer price
points because they do have some
business grade features but they're also
not as high priced as some of the
business grade masses I've encountered
in the past which is kind of cool so
check this out it includes their black
armor software so you can discover your
nas on Windows and Mac you can do
incremental or full system backups in
Windows you can also recourse restore
systems one by one incremental is really
really cool means you don't have to use
up all your drive space for a couple of
backups ok hot-swappable SATA 2/3 drive
bays USM slot this is really cool check
this out so this is intended for
off-site backup so you can use your nas
as a convenient way to put data on
something that can be archived easily or
sent somewhere else so check this out
this is one of Seagate's
I forget what this one is then I've lost
track of what the branding is this is an
older free agent go flexible it works
with their newer stuff as well where
it's just a nice little slimline to a
half inch portable drive you can get
them in much higher capacities now this
one's 500 gig you slot that in there you
transfer some data
you throw a label on it you archive it
on a shelf or you put it in a safety
deposit box or wherever else you want to
keep it safe
very very cool little thing to include
that's on both the 2 bay and the four
bay and it works just like that you've
also got two USB 3 ports for additional
expansion so there's a USB 3 in the
front just in case you're keeping it
like I don't know on a desk or something
or whatever else and then they each have
an additional USB 3 port in the back
next to haha check this out dual gigabit
ethernet ports now that's not to say
that you're going to get two gigabit per
second transfer speeds out of it but its
redundancy so if one of these interfaces
fails outright this thing will still
work which is very very cool your power
in as well as a hard reset button
they're also located on the back of both
of these devices so there's those USB 3
ports I was going to talk about the to
Bay has a 40 mil fan whereas the 3 Bay
has what appears to be a 92 millimeter
fan that you can pull out and change if
you want I suppose I usually end up
doing that with naz's just because they
ship with fans that are unnecessarily
powerful and I usually put like a super
silent low rpm fan in them they both
include the exact same set of
accessories so you've got a power cable
a Gigabit Ethernet cable and your
warranty information as well as the
software disc that includes all that
backup stuff that I talked about before
so your warranty is three years on these
products let's go ahead and start
getting into what makes them even more
special than that full support for all
of your usual servers so you can run an
FTP server off of it you can run an HTTP
server off of it whoa ho I scuzzy
targeting very cool the last time I
looked into this it was 450 to 500 bucks
for a bear enclosure that worked with
ice Guzzi but wasn't particularly fast
so I'm really excited to see what
Seagate's got going on here because
that's a very competitive feature to
have even for like a higher priced
product so very very cool very few naz's
support I scuzzy and the sort of smaller
and more inexpensive sort of I mean okay
normally you're looking at like a net
year like rackmount or something like
that
multiple volume management that's cool
so you can set up different storage
volumes you can also if you don't want
to set up different storage volumes you
can do quota and share management for
different users as well as volume level
encryption so you can manage who can see
what who has access to what who's
allowed to use how much of the space and
all that good stuff it supports Active
Directory as well as raid zero one five
ten or span and I would really recommend
guys with a server like this a four base
server where you're keeping
business important data of some sort do
not run a single Drive
do not run raid zero it shouldn't even
support raid zero I wish the
manufacturers would just stop including
support for raid zero because it's
terrible
run raid 5 or raid 10 where you're using
either one drive or half of your drives
for redundancy just in case something
bad happens so redundancy and off-site
backup is what storage is all about so I
just showed you the whole process of
installing a drive I wanted to check out
what drive Seagate's including with
these enclosures so this one right here
has 2 2 terabyte drives in it so they're
using their Barracuda series drives I
wouldn't have minded seeing them
including their constellation series
drives which are there they're more sort
of enterprise grade storage drives but I
guess if the intention is for the user
to be using raid anyway
personally in my own as that I use for
all of our tech tips data I am using
Barracuda drives so you know I can say
all I want well we should be using you
know enterprise grade drives but I
actually don't and I haven't really had
any issues with that either so there you
go Oh what else they got going on here
local backup oh yeah this is so cool
Nazz tuned as backup is supported so you
can go USM / USB device to nest so you
can kind of go okay dude did it did it -
do I want to backup this thing for
example this right here is our steam
game Drive so we have all of our Steam
games for our test benches on here so if
I'm like oh I'd be a real pain if that
drive died and I lost it I could do an
incremental backup just by popping it in
here and configuring it everyone so well
very very cool stuff the forebay has a
little LCD in the front by the way in
case you guys are wondering to bay
doesn't have that you can also have
multiple nasa's and backup from nouns to
NOS that's something that many nasa's do
not support or the functionality is so
hidden and so broken that it's basically
not usable anyway so that's very very
cool there's a OneTouch transfer button
on the front there's that one and
network desta's backup yes very very
cool that that kind of stuff just gets
me geeking out Apple Time Machine
software is supported which is cool as
well as a bare metal restore over
network that's another huge one being
able to do a bare metal restore
basically means that you
can circumvent a lot of the inconvenient
stuff that comes along with backing up
machines sort of normally with respect
to licensing and stuff like that so it's
it's a very convenient way to be able to
do backups uh this is another thing too
this I mean you could consider an iTunes
server or a DLNA server to be more of a
consumer-grade feature but I personally
don't because if you were to deploy
probably not something like this but
probably something like this one where
you throw two drives in here and raid
one so that you have redundancy just in
case something dies you put that in like
a store or something you use the iTunes
server or the DLNA server to power all
of your digital signage off of this one
little box that's what I see that kind
of functionality being forced so it does
support both iTunes and DLNA so you can
stream to supported devices I don't
think I ever showed the front of them up
close so there's activity LEDs USB 3
power button and then same thing on the
other one I wish the front wasn't glossy
but I guess it's not the end of the
world and then on the other one same
thing power activity LEDs and then your
front USB 3 I think that pretty much oh
yeah Seagate private cloud so you can
create your own sort of cloud I mean
really that's what an as is creating
your own network storage so that you can
have all of your storage in one place
I'm a huge advocate of network attached
storage I think everyone should be using
it for pretty much everything but their
Seagate private cloud is not just the
ability to kind of set up an FTP server
for yourself and kludge it together but
also the ability to use their smartphone
app to access your little private cloud
wherever you are so there you go keep
all your data somewhere keep it safe and
then preferably keep it somewhere else
as well
