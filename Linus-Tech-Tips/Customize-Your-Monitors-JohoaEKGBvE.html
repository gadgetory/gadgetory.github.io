modding you quickly come to terms with a
simple truth nothing comes out of the
box in an ideal state even the highest
end product can be tweaked to run faster
quieter or assuming it's already perfect
in those regards at least look better
not to mention the appeal of making
every component you own fit your
personal preferences whatever those
might be after all if you work at your
computer like I do you probably interact
with it more than you do your family or
friends so what's a few our investment
in some modding in this sponsored video
from iFixit we'll be showing you guys
how to transform a simple 3 monitor
array from boring to beautiful by d
bezel in each monitor then remounting it
in a custom housing
for this project we wanted to remove the
LCD panels from these three monitors and
remount them in this handmade wooden
housing but Linus you might ask why
bother with that there are cheap stands
on Amazon that you could use to achieve
the same objective and without voiding
your warranties so our first step is to
safely get the LCDs out of their plastic
casings and to aid in our disassembly
efforts we'll be using the pro Tek
toolkit to void our warranties in the
smoothest and most professional way
possible and while I might feel
confident in my ability to pull off this
mod by just free-balling it I'm trying
to cut down on the frequency with which
I am brought low by my own hubris so
I'll be referring to this iFixit
community guide for step-by-step
instructions step 1
unscrew and remove the stand attached to
the back of the monitor okay I that I
could have figured out on my own
step 2 lay the monitor flat and begin to
loosen the bezels the display bezel is
held to the rear of the case by a few
plastic clips that should come free
relatively easily you'll want to use a
light gentle touch and avoid prying with
any tools in order to avoid damaging the
LCD this is good advice for modders and
proctologists though the similarities
end at step 3 grip the edges of the
bezel in the center of each side and
gently pull directly upwards you should
hear a slight pop as the clips come free
if you hear a snap or a crunch it's
likely you've damaged your screen so to
avoid confusion from ambient noise it's
best not to perform this step as part of
a balanced breakfast moving on the
corners are held on a little tighter so
to get them started you'll need to
insert a Jimmy into the lower left
corner and pop the first clip the reason
we use this point on the casing is that
on this particular model the HDMI logo
gives us a good reference point for
where to find the clip behind the bezel
though if you're exceptionally keen on
squeezing every possible ounce of
excitement out of your day feel free to
pick any other corner and just fiddle
about blindly after that the other
corner should simply
off with some gentle twisting but if any
prove especially stubborn don't hesitate
to slip them a quick Jimmy now that
we've removed the LCDs from their
housings we can set them aside and work
on our custom frame we assembled this by
building two boxes out of two by fours
one to hold two horizontal monitors and
one to hold a single vertical unit then
we attach them at a slight angle we just
used a chop saw to cut to the right
length and to get the angles on our
joint pieces once the LCDs are affixed
inside we'll attach some decorative
bording to make it look classy wood
paneling kids it's not just for vans
anymore so to make these we just
measured from the edge of the frame to
the edge of the screen and then cut
strips out of a sheet of balsa and
stained them it's time then for final
assembly we're going to use these
existing holes that happen to be on the
sides of our monitors to mount brackets
which will then be screwed into our main
assembly note that if you don't use
correctly sized screws when doing any
custom mounting with a d-- bezel monitor
it is very easy to inadvertently damage
the screen then with each LCD firmly in
place we lift the control panels from
the backing and thankfully the
pre-attached wires are long enough we
reattach them onto the face of our frame
we want the controls to match our
aesthetic so we're going to mount them
behind a panel between the LCDs and
drill a series of holes over each button
then we 3d print some button extensions
paint them a brownish hue and insert
them through the holes and there you
have it whether your goal in removing
your monitors bezel is to decrease the
overall space between your displays in a
multi monitor gaming setup or if your
final product is something more esoteric
the guides and tools from iFixit can
help you minimize the risk involved in
modifying your Hardware so a shout out
to Asus for providing the monitors for
our Frankenstein project and I fix it
