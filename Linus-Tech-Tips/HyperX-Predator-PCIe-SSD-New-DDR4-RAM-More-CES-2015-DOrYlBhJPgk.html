brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX so we're hanging out checking
out what HyperX is showing off here at
the show and I've got three things right
in front of me first of all we've got
their savage ddr3 memory so the kit that
happens to be in here right now is the
16 gig kit of 24 hundred megahertz
memory honestly not a lot has changed
ddr3 isn't exactly cutting-edge anymore
but they've got a nice new ID on it
that's gonna look great on you know an
rog board and actually this system
overall looks freaking fantastic it's an
allele EPC o6s and I'm going to have to
get one of these for a review or
something because this looks like one
wicked gaming system of course of course
it looks mostly wicked because of all
the cool HyperX stuff inside so they've
actually got their new HyperX savage SSD
this is using a FISA nestin controller
it's available in 240 480 and 960 gig
capacities and in terms of performance
this one's it's kind of funny because
you know it's like yeah it's a new
controller but yeah it still stay to 3
because we don't really have anything
faster than that so we're looking at
around 560 megabytes per second reads
around 520 or 5 40 megabytes per second
writes depending on where things land at
the end of the day and in terms of what
that means in the real world well right
over here it's it's kind of like awesome
beautiful HyperX industrial design meets
sort of kingston marketing here's ours
here's all the other set of 3 SSDs
basically you know ours is good because
it's you know backed by Kingston it's
good quality and all that stuff and now
in incompressible scenarios where so say
for example on a sand forest Drive it
might perform really well sometimes and
not as well other times we are gonna be
definitely competitive with everything
else on the market and we look great
doing it so that's about all there is to
say about it this is a little bit more
on the interesting side this is the new
HyperX predator this is an MDOT 2 SSD
it's got four PCI Express gen 2 lanes
and this has none of that mundane SATA 3
bottleneck stuff going on if the read
speeds on this one is 1.4 gigabytes per
second and writes is one gigabyte per
second it's available in the same
so that's 240 480 and 960 gig and you
can actually install it a number of
different ways in fact in the system
behind me they've got it installed two
different ways so it's installed
directly in an m dot 2 slot on the
Maximus 7 gene motherboard right here
and then it's also available with a PCI
Express riser card and so you can just
install it in any PCI Express slot and
your motherboard assuming you don't have
an MDOT 2 slot and this is just a nice
touch there actually I'm not sure if
this is the final PCB design
I heard there's one that's gonna have
like dick buts on the back or something
like that or know about there's there's
discussion about maybe dressing it up a
little bit but little things like making
the PCB black I've seen other high
performance great for gaming you know
PCI Express SSD riser card slits like
green PCB is like do you guys even look
at gaming systems so at least I'll say
this the HyperX team is looking at what
gaming systems are supposed to look like
and making sure the product performs
well and looks good inside speaking of
stuff that performs well huge shout out
to our primary sponsor for the show yeah
I got to throw in that primary just for
you guys because they they jumped on
board earlier than you phantom blast
these guys make great screen protectors
they're made of Gorilla Glass so they
look fantastic on your phone they feel
great to your finger and they're
extremely scratch resistant they're
available at stores antim glass that's
linked in the video description and also
a shout-out to HyperX they are
sponsoring us here at the show you guys
are gonna want to check out their
YouTube channels youtube.com slash
HyperX we've got it linked in the video
description huge thanks to those guys
for allowing us to be here and as you
see just because someone sponsored us to
be at the show that doesn't prevent us
