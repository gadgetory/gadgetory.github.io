package maybe I'll just have to try
every unit 104 in the entire complex
Nick light is exiled to the server room
I know it's stuffy in here
but at least it's super hot great and
Justin shows off his guns
that's all you again
intel is bringing ddr4 to the mainstream
with their all-new core i7 6700 K and
Core i5 6600 K processors check out the
link in the video description to learn
more so I'm ordering a barcode scanner
which was Brandon's brilliant idea that
he shared with me far too late for us to
make use of it right away for how we can
keep track of our inventory there's
apparently a really good software and we
can use a barcode scanner to scan things
in and out with little little cheap
labels so I'm getting that on order so
we can hopefully get that Rock increase
soon I'll be ordering from Amazon CA not
calm because I leaked all my US dollar
credit card numbers in a Twitter picture
this weekend so I had to cancel those
so that's inconvenient Wow I didn't even
there the 7 yep
Wow sure did um so Nick wants to know
where his workstation is so subscribe to
set up at a pretty prime location here
okay right next to the the data
connection really so here's your
computer right here okay that's also
prime location fantastic yeah I know
it's stuffy in here but at least it's
super hot great
I go upstairs or is that not side yeah
or there's not a setup but you can build
a high so I saved a canned response in
my email with our address here so that I
could quickly bring it up because I had
memorized it yet so our router didn't
manage to arrive because the saved
address was wrong
Canada Post or pure later or someone
managed to deliver it
so I want to find out who the crap they
delivered my package to this might be it
because this building know who did they
take it to this is one eight six six
nine and this would be the unit but this
looks anything
I have never heard of this before they
have 200 packs of pre-pasted disposable
toothbrushes on the stairs I don't know
what's going on in there maybe I'll just
have to try every unit 104 in the entire
complex hey there is a one eight six six
three all right well that's that's good
I guess why did they accept my Pappy's
104 yeah baby okay awesome why did they
say I don't know well it seems to be
unopened so this was something that I
actually like super duper needed on
Friday and would have been really good
to have our UPS is use a 20 amp plug
standard they don't have replaceable
cords and our wall outlets are just the
normal 50 amp parallel connectors so
these are adapters if I plug that into
the wall plug my UPS into there and
dippity poppity good to go making sure
is easy my god these things are so heavy
oh it's an entire battery
it's just nothing but battery inside so
last time I open to this thing so much
dismay this time I'm prepared yeah
that's right okay to all the
electricians watching I know that
doesn't mean that the circuit is now
capable of 20 amps I know I just need to
adapt it so I can plug it in there is no
way that this thing is gonna just mount
with ears I mean sure you
it doesn't even have real nails so
unfortunately the drill bit which is I
believe contain iam I couldn't really
stand up to a bamboo table hi hey
Titanic Asian Wars so unfortunately one
of our holes is going to have a titanium
bit in it stupid drill is just a bit too
big oh nice Media Group good enough okay
Dennis let's put this one in how's that
fit um not good but good enough - Media
Group 2015 that's how it is it's not in
there
so she said the hugs and okay fine are
you doing I'm waiting for the inter have
to come back you don't need a helmet for
what we're doing that's not a white on
it I it's dark in here
it's not a dark in here there's a light
it's not dark at all so we have to
completely pull the rack out Oh
in order to fix my screw up that would
make it
right it's not that dark in here Aaron
you need to help it for life these
servers are getting so dusty yeah I was
worried about that what what can we do
about that right now the room itself is
crazy awesome you vacuumed it we don't
have a Mac you might try back so we have
a broom well that's something
hold on hold on don't sleep yet I don't
want things powered on while we're doing
this because then the fans are just
gonna suck crap back into their intakes
also this broom is like I need a flat
broom we have a better room
teryn - that's right hey are the servers
off servers are off I want to power
everything oh this is pretty bad so
we're almost done putting the new
workbench together that's all Sallah
bamboo very strong straight from Taiwan
man there's a lot of dust so the reason
why we're even doing this when the
construction is still going on is
because contractors of course are
notoriously slow in building stuff but
we had to be moved by certain things so
we have to move in even though
constructions not done which is why
everything is covered in dust
the rails yeah you can take some of that
weed it back oh there we go okay okay so
now this needs to go somewhere somewhere
outside maybe we'll blow it out up there
for a moment it yep
oh dear yeah
really glad that we did that are you
going to do the other fun everyone get
out of the way
yeah this is really heavy this is the
archive Wow so you're hoping basically
everything the company has ever done
ever Oh Lord I love this feather for
like him use that more man
so we've got an Intel Nichkhun here now
which is which is good I had actually
pulled that out when I was diagnosing
something like ages ago and then I never
went and put it back in well and for
optimal performance in these systems
they want to know the NIC that they sent
it with instead of me just tinkering
around with things and putting in
whatever I feel like stuff so basically
these cell phone signal booster isn't
working um and unfortunately it's all
the way up there attached basically to
the roof so I think I'm gonna have to
use the scissor lift to get up there did
you find that the H+ no I'm very sad
trying to figure out what to do cuz like
the Internet's out but I go I like try
and help people with what they're doing
a miracle we already have two people in
so like do you guys need work to do I
see like four people here I would be
working but the server is down like it's
right here I'm sure you I'm sure there
are other things other things to do I've
way too much work but there's no
internet and then I don't know what the
hell's to do okay love you are gonna
build your own desk okay no splinter out
okay
don't pull up that's right yeah those
are each one is a full-up desk but don't
tear that up okay that yeah that's
definitely we're going to take one at a
time yo mama remember lift with your
back and twist you can lift with your
back you just got to keep it straight
right form once you get to higher
weights form is like you need good form
or else you just screw yourself
I don't plan to lift refrigerators you
don't want to be a part of the thousand
pounds oh no no no no it's done stop you
had one chance gun showing it free hey I
thought guns were hard to get in Canada
hahahahaha he's got a pair right there
hey right there hold on is it hot yeah
man that bastard is dead
we doing save positions okay I got a
window seat it's so beautiful
look vertical this is a preview of your
life in prison very go why are you going
it just flip it over flip it over look
ours is over yeah
assembling me up there what did you stop
I hit my ankle with this by the way it
really hurt welcome to your new up desk
oh boy we want this into a 1 a 2 MLS a 1
or a 2 it's working it's awesome it's
pretty gradual turn oh it's our they're
already set some fast moves anxious
there is another one that is easier nuts
