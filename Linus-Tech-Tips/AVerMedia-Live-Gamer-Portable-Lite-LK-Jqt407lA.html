wanted to have close ups of products in
our unboxing videos but we didn't have
the resources to spend half a day
shooting b-roll of like a case to overly
during a review instead my brilliant
idea was to buy a couple of capture
cards and use two cameras with a
computer as a switcher to go between the
two camera angles on the fly this I
thought would require two camera
operators but would save on editing well
that idea sucked and the videos we made
that way sucked too but the reason I
told the story wasn't to point out one
of the many mistakes I've made as a
youtuber but rather to explain why I've
spent a lot of time shopping for video
capture cards over the last couple of
years why I've bought a handful of them
and then why I hate them so very much
the jazz mini phone and tablet stand
from Coolermaster is now available in a
variety of cool colors from these great
retailers click now to learn more mostly
my issue is that they just aren't user
friendly detecting the format of a video
source and adapting it on the fly is
technology that we've had on TVs and
monitors for decades so why is it that
many video capture cards require you to
manually select an input resolution and
refresh rate something that can be
surprisingly tricky to do when cameras
are such coil it'll about how they're
actually putting outputting on top of
that black magics intensity Pro actually
fairly well-regarded card that cost a
lot more than this one here today has
suffered from everything from outright
refusal to work to the random blue
screen issues that we have now on the
LAN show across a variety of the lesses
and platforms that I've tried to get it
working correctly on and that is why I
love the AVerMedia live gamer portable
coupled with Avery media's rec central
software it's fast flexible and so easy
to use that my mother could do it if all
she wanted to do was capture her
gameplay from the same PC with low
latency from a separate PC game console
or other video device or to an SD card
for editing later ok Linus so we're a
couple minutes in now and you haven't
even talked about the LGP light yet what
is your point my point is that if you
just want a super easy to use portable
video capture device
this is the one I would buy seven days
of the week because it's basically a
live game reportable with a couple fewer
features it still got the low latency
HDMI pass-through that supports up to
1080 60 P but bear in mind it records at
30fps max it still got the Handy record
button on top that tells the software to
start capturing it still got analog
audio pass-through which can be handy
sometimes and it still runs off of just
a USB port with no additional power
needed but of course this solution costs
money compared to free stuff like using
your CPU or GPU to do the encoding for
you so then why would you care well CPU
encoding is not really ideal at all it
slows down your computer which if you're
streaming like I don't know battle chess
or something on Twitch isn't a huge deal
but if you're doing something demanding
and you don't have a crazy CPU it could
legitimately impact your gaming
experience GPU encoding on the other
hand is a pretty legit competitor here
for game streamers with shadow play you
can record and stream at 60fps and up to
2560 by 1440 res there's very little
performance penalty since the graphics
card is using a fairly similar type of
hardware it's also a dedicated h.264
encoder it can record constantly so you
can go back and capture moments that
have already passed and of course it's
absolutely free if you have a supported
graphics card so then Linus why do we
still care about this hardware the
answer is flexibility with this external
h.264 capture device I can use whatever
software I want for streaming and
capture whether it's the included app
obs/xsplit/whatever I can capture from
any non HDCP HDMI equipped device I want
whether it's a camera PC console such as
a PlayStation 4 or Xbox one as long as
you've got the appropriate firmware
update for your ps4 or whatever else and
I don't have to rely on the system to be
booted up and GeForce experience to
cooperate with me for it to work in fact
I can even record like changing
resolutions and stuff like that and
it'll still manage to just sort of okay
it'll be like whoa no signal okay and
then it'll figure it out and it'll keep
going these things are extremely robust
and aside from all that I acknowledge
that not all the stuff I just said will
be applicable to the average consumer
being able to use it for stuff like
recording bio settings has saved us time
and improve the production values of our
videos and we've done crazy stuff like
live broadcasting the entire
presentation and in videos GTX 780 Ti
launched just by having a live gamer
portable hooked up to a Wi-Fi equipped
laptop in a backpack and carrying a
camera plugged in via HDMI around the
venue it's just a really really cool
piece of hardware and this one is just
like it just without the SD slot as well
as the analog input and it's cheaper so
conclusion time the reason I agreed to
do this review even though it's
basically just a slightly trimmed down
version of a product that I've already
talked about before at a lower price is
because I feel like I didn't do the
original live gamer portable justice
last time and now that I've been using
it for so long I feel like I needed to
do something to get across what a great
device I think it is and whether you go
with the deluxe live gamer portable
version or the bare-bones lgp light one
for your video capture needs be they
gaming related or something else
entirely I know that you guys will be as
happy as I am because unlike so many of
the other solutions I've tried it
actually just works which is all I ask
for thank you for watching guys like
this video if you liked it just like it
if you just liked it leave a comment

streaming method if you do any you know
game streaming capture or whatever else
