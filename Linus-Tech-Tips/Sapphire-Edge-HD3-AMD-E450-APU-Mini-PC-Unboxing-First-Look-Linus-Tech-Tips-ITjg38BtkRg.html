Edge HD 3 or cube to however you want to
interpret that mini pcs so sapphire is
no stranger to computer technologies
especially ones built by AMD they've
been doing graphics cards for AMD going
back as far as like dinosaurs and
they've also got some AMD motherboards
but as far as all-in-one PCs go this is
by far the most impressive
product that I think they have yet
released although I haven't seen one in
person yet I have seen the marketing
materials this is why I'm like skipping
right to the like the part where the box
opens and I think the thing out because
I want to check this thing out in person
before I say almost anything about it so
inside we find some packing materials
look at that foam they're all they're
pretty like serious business about
foaming it up in here making sure that
your your PC arrives in one piece
because and this is this is good
foresight on their part because this is
one of sapphires first things that
they're shipping with a hard drive
inside right so they're all like yeah
normally video cards no big deal it gets
shaken around a little bit what's gonna
get damaged well a hard drive can so
they've got a nice foam layer going on
on all sides of this thing it feels very
adequately protected in my personal
opinion ok there's your driver disc
don't you bother with that download the
latest off the sapphire website quick
installation guide so this covers
quickly installing thanks to other
things user manual so it's only six
pages it's gotta be pretty
straightforward here I've got some specs
got some FCC things going on okay cool
got like a sapphire product registration
form it's got a power cord hey look at
this we've got a an HDMI cable looks
like it's even gold-plated that's handy
because I needed an HDMI cable
obviously the HDMI cable is not the
point of the product but you know it's
in here I might as well use it right
there you go
gold-plated HDMI action going on in
there cool looks like it's about
a meter all right we got a stand it's a
little screw on the bottom it's
rubberized on the bottom so it's not
gonna go anywhere cool cool Oh check
this out we also have an HDMI to DVI
adapter that is single-link DVI guys
because HDMI is pin the pin compatible
with single-link DVI so you're not going
to be going above 1920 by 1200 at 60
Hertz just remember that I mean there's
probably not many scenarios where you
would be doing that with this anyhow but
there you are okay so you got a power
cord you have your different power cord
and finally let's get to it here it is
I'm very excited about this don't laugh
at me I'm talking to slick not the
audience so there it is this is the Edge
HD 3 here's our power button here's our
hard drive activity LED here on the
front we have two USB 3.0 ports there
you go for that up got like a soft touch
finish I realized like looking at it
that it probably looks kind of just like
dusty but when I go like this you can
see it comes very very clean so it has
it has a good way of like masking that
so once you once you wipe it down once
then it should be pretty much good to go
so that's kind of nice I personally love
these like rubberized grip II grippy
feels on the bottom here we can see that
looks like your hard drive right there
next to the ventilation holes there's
the screw on the bottom for attaching it
to the stand if you should see fit and
on the back we find our i/o so we have
VGA just in case you still need it HDMI
2 USB 2.0 ports gigabit ethernet power
as well as headphones and microphone
ports so what makes this guy special is
the real question here I'm just going to
go ahead and attach it to a little stand
a few things would be the answer here
and number one is the fact that it uses
AMD's e450
pee-yew so at APU if you guys do or
don't recall I'm gonna say it anyway
an APU is a combination CPU and graphics
processing unit so what it means is you
have DirectX 11 graphics power in this
unit it is capable of running DirectX 11
titles I wouldn't expect to be running
them on the highest details or the most
demanding DirectX 11 titles but it can
run DirectX 11 features so there you go
so stuff like dirt 3 yes it will run off
of this slimline PC which is very very
cool it's got 4 gigs of memory the
graphics card is equivalent to what
would be called a Radeon 63 20 yes just
double check sorry I have a hard time
remembering which HD graphics core goes
with which APU sometimes so inside here
also for the CPU component of the APU is
a 1.6 gigahertz dual-core I mean look at
this form factor it's ridiculous yeah
I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it I'm
gonna do the iPhone size comparison for
those of you who think that I'm showing
off that I have an iPhone I mean come on
get real it's an iPhone 4 that's not the
point the point is everyone knows how
big an iPhone is so if I hold something
up to an iPhone everyone knows how big
it is so there you go that's the
thickness comparison against the iPhone
and here is the size comparison against
the iPhone so this thing is just tiny
considering the fact that it contains a
full PC inside so it's got oh you know
what I miss something I missed it
because I didn't actually see it hold on
a second guys
we found it cleverly disguised is the
Kensington compatible locking slot you
see it looks just like a ventilation
hole except slightly larger very
convenient because if you're looking for
a place whether you know you're good
airport or in a coffee shop you need
like a check-out terminal PC whatever
else if you're looking for a low-power
PC but you don't want someone to run off
with it because it doesn't weigh much
and it you know is very very small and
can easily like you know I'm assuming I
had a pocket here yeah hide it in a coat
pocket or something like that you could
easily run off with it if it isn't
locked down
speaking of low-power sapphire claims
less than 30 watts under load for the
whole PC holy crap so stay tuned on my
NCIX comm channel where we're actually
going to put all of their claims
to task but that sounds very impressive
especially because under a typical usage
scenario you wouldn't come even close to
that load power consumption because
you're not even going to be loading the
graphics core that's built into the APU
one other thing about this particular
unit is that it does not come with an
operating system or rather I should say
it doesn't come with a Windows operating
system it comes with free dos or
something like that so you're gonna have
to source your own Windows operating
system you know you can buy OEM copies
online you don't have to buy the retail
copies which are more expensive and like
a big-box store buy just grab an OEM
copy for around 100 bucks and you should
be good to go or if you already have a
retail Windows license then you can go
ahead and reuse it on this machine as
long as you're not still using it on the
machine that you already have so thank
you for checking out my unboxing of the
Edge HD 3 or cute whichever you prefer
