the sea Sonic G Series modular power
supply this is an 80 plus gold but still
value oriented power supply line from C
Sonic so their g series has well the
usual things you've come to expect from
C Sonic of course efficiency is a huge
one build quality as well as a very very
silent mode of operation so let's get it
opened up and then we'll go over those
things in a little bit more detail the
first thing inside is the user's manual
which is available in a variety of
language including English droid
translate and each page is like or each
each language is like one page so yeah
we're not going to spend too much time
on that next we've got some accessories
this is so actually this is a pretty
generous number of cable ties to include
like to see that so there you go you got
some black cable ties to manage the
cables in your system that you're
probably building if you bought a power
supply a little powered by Sonic sticker
some thumb screw or rather some mounting
screws and three velcro cable ties that
are reusable softt foam of course
although very thin soft foam I might add
modular cables so this is a semi modular
power supply which means that the
connectors that everyone needs every
time they build a system are hardwired
whereas the connectors that not everyone
needs not every time they build a system
are not connected by default okay so
there's the power supply itself now
let's go through some of the things that
see sonic wants us to know about this
particular series of power supplies so
DC to DC converter design that gives you
almost full access to the output power
of the power supply unit on the 12 volt
rail because what a DC to DC design is
doing is it's actually taking the 12
volt rail and down converting it to
other voltages so almost the entire bulk
of the power supply is all about
converting 120 volt to 240 volt AC to 12
volt DC type voltage regulation plus or
minus 3% this is well within
specifications for an ATX power supply
smart and silent fan control good good
good we've come to expect that from sea
sonic they remember guys to see sonic
was the one to pioneer that feature on
the back of the power supply where you
can turn the fan off out right up to 50
percent load on there 80 plus platinum
thousand watt unit
unfortunately that feature is not
available on this one but it goes to
show you how serious they are about
silence high reliability 105 degree
aluminum electrolytic capacitors and for
those of you who criticize my
pronunciation of aluminum yes I know
aluminium is also correct but it should
be noted check the spelling guys there's
no second die aluminum is also correct
although most prevalent in the US and
Canada okay
detachable modular cables yeah high
current gold-plated terminals this is
kind of a new thing haven't seen much of
that yet 12 centimeter ball bearing
cooling fan double ball bearing okay
ultra ventilation honeycomb structure
multi-gpu technologies supported
universal AC input and a five-year
warranty
Wow that's actually very aggressive
given that this isn't one of their super
duper premium you know full modular and
turn off your fan up to 50 percent kind
of products really like the sleeving
they've included these are extremely
flexible cables compared to ones that
i've seen in the past and they have this
see I love to see this they have not
hardwired anything that they didn't have
to so you've got a four plus four which
everyone needs and a 24-pin which
everyone needs some guys hardwire an
additional you know SATA thing or like a
couple PCIe connectors not everyone has
an aftermarket GPU or like an off for
our dedicated graphics card not everyone
needs that everyone needs these to love
to see that they've also given you a
pretty good selection it looks like a
modular cables here so we're going to go
ahead and check these out
something to note guys if you don't
already know this is C sonic is an
actual manufacturer most of the power
supplies you buy are manufactured by
someone other than the label on the
front of the box see Sonic actually
designs manufacturers packages then
supports the C Sonic branded power
supplies that you're buying from them so
just kind of think about that if you're
ever curious who's an actual
manufacturer you can always google it
online but I can tell you right now that
most of the top brands that you're
familiar with do not make power supplies
many of them design them and they help
you know specify they help with the
specifications and what they want to see
but in terms of actual manufacturers
with actual retail presence see Sonic is
one of the only ones so modular cables
included love flat ribbon modular cables
and they're all in black and the
sleeving is black and it's not very
see-through so it's going to look good
in your system no matter what you've got
two six plus two pin PCIe connectors
this is a 550 watt power supply so it's
probably most suitable for a single GPU
system anyway if you're using a high-end
graphics card so that is the perfect
number of connectors those ones go right
here then you have four more modular
connectors and those ones can be used
for a dual molex harness nice short one
so if you're plugging in just a water
cooling pump or like one thing this will
be perfect for that
a triple molex and then you can use an
adapter if you really need a floppy
connector still so that's great if
you're going somewhere sort of a little
bit further away you can see that's a
significantly longer cable it's about
one Linus arm length okay then you've
got a double SATA so this will be
perfect for running to a hard drive cage
or a couple SSDs or something nearby and
finally a quad SATA harness as well so
this will be perfect if you need to run
sort of one two kind of a hard drive
here then you need one to go up to an
optical drive or something like that so
they've given you a good variety of
connectors the power supply itself has a
pretty standard matte black paint finish
looks pretty durable
now actually that's pretty good yeah
it's powder coated so there's not really
a whole lot to go wrong all your safety
certifications and all that stuff that
we pretty much take for granted at this
point but bear in mind guys it actually
does cost a lot of money to bring
our supply to market got to go through a
whole slew of tests honeycomb here
on/off switch here power in here look at
that the labels are oriented correctly
so that in a standard case whether it's
top mounted bottom mounted flipped like
this flip like this all of the text will
be correctly oriented and finally a
honeycomb mesh here to go with the 120
millimeter fan that takes care of
cooling for your power supply thank you
for checking out my unboxing and first
look at the CE Sonic G serie is 550 watt
80 plus gold power supply don't forget
