fastest single GPU gaming laptop that we
have ever had in our office the zephyrus
GX 701 is an absolute beast rocking a
six core core i7 processor and a geforce
r-tx 28 Emacs q that's clocked closer to
a desktop spec than the laptop one but
how the heck have they managed to cram
all of that power in here and has the
extra performance been worth the
interesting design choices that you know
like the keyboard placement wait wait
where's the webcam it's not here it's
not here is it under here oh no that's
just our sponsor build GG build DG is
the same folks behind cable mod and they
made a website where you can show off
your new rig check it out at the link
below and enter their 10k challenge
contest
the Zephyrus GX 701 does an excellent
job of looking both classy and gay
Murray at the same time blending eye
catching details like the colorful ROG
logos and RGB keyboard with a very
sturdy black magnesium alloy chassis
that gives the device a distinctly
premium feel
now the zephyrus does look a bit like an
oddball but at this point we've pretty
much come to expect its small offset
vertical trackpad it's shifted keyboard
and the ventilation flat party trick
that opens up the back of the chassis
for improved airflow speaking of party
tricks in the Box you get a little metal
sculpture of the ROG logo which is cool
I guess but honestly ASIS I would have
much rather there was a Gigabit Ethernet
dongle in here it's the only port that's
really notably missing from what's
otherwise a very solid assortment of i/o
with USB C with charging and full-sized
HDMI all making appearances now let's
get into performance as we discussed in
our review of the msi gs70 5 invidious
mobile r-tx cards can have extremely
varied thermal and power targets with
about half of their performance
depending on laptop manufacturers
ability to completely optimize both
cooling and power delivery so with that
in mind before we proceed with our
testing we need to disable the
illuminated logo right here above the
keyboard because according to a soos
it's possible to see a three degree
increase in temperatures while it's on
and when push comes to shove it turns
out that we are not actually willing to
give up real performance for RGB
lighting and we don't have to in the 3d
mark portroyal test our GX 701 s
graphics core managed 1600 megahertz for
the duration of the test time which is
shockingly close to desktop performance
and side note absolutely smashes the msi
gs70 5
translates into real-world performance
that just run circles around last end
laptops enabling high refresh rate
gaming and triple-a titles that
previously would have run closer to 60
FPS than they would to 144 now we
haven't got any other max-q laptops in
yet so we don't know if others on the
market will be equally fast but we do
know that they won't be faster for that
you would need something truly massive
like the ROG mothership or the Alienware
area 51 M and there's more good news the
FPS isn't the only thing that's been
turned up here so has the screen size
with a 17 inch thin bezel display
sitting where a 15.6 inch one used to be
but this did come with a sacrifice not
only is there no webcam up here there
isn't one anywhere else on the machine
blasphemy
now asus solution was to pack a 1080p
60fps webcam in the box with the logic
being that well we have to choose
between one of two options including a
barely usable webcam like what i'ma
sided with the GS 75 stealth or include
one that doesn't fit in the laptops
chassis but is frankly good enough for
twitch streaming well okay fair point
but here's my take why are you guys
acting like there are only two ways of
doing something why is it my job to come
up with something else here's an idea
free of charge you make an indent here
and you put a camera bump there the
smartphone industry has been doing it
for years and then we could have even
better front-facing cameras or I mean
while we're thinking outside of the box
instead of this going on like this
how about magnets there is no reason
that they couldn't have run a USB 2
interface up here had little contact
points that power it and handle data and
you just put it on there and it snaps
into place now in fairness as it is the
quality is great the best that we've
seen on a gaming laptop but the
implementation is truly clunky back to
the display though this thing it's very
impressive
it's a
144 Hertz IPs 1080p panel with g-sync
3 millisecond response times and factory
calibration from Pantone frankly it's
awesome to game on and it's got other
benefits to a soos astutely noticed that
a lot of people purchase gaming
computers like this for professional
tasks like cad music creation and video
editing so they actually tuned the
display to be more suitable for these
tasks and it's great because video
editing on laptops used to be a giant
bag of suck nowadays honestly for basic
cutting you can't tell the difference
and even for some light after effects
work they are pretty darn capable of
course for more professional or creative
work CPU power is key
which is why desktops still have a lot
of life in them by the way I mean any
system with the core i7 8700 K will
destroy the Zephyrus for a lot less
money but Asus has done quite a bit to
make the core i7 8750 H in here more
potent it's 1200 score and Cinebench is
higher than most core i9 laptops that
we've tested and under an all core
synthetic load the CPU gets toasty while
it's turbo Eng Ben settles down to a
more reasonable level at around 3
gigahertz sustained that's not bad
the only way to get more performance out
of a laptop would be to buy something
much thicker which is kind of becoming a
recurring theme here and along with its
strong CPU performance the GX 701 can be
equipped with up to 24 gigs of RAM 8
gigs soldered while the remaining 16 is
on a sodium slot and a one terabyte nvme
SSD from Samsung that really impressed
us like this machine regularly loaded
games and completed tasks faster than
the two rate zeroed SSDs in the GS 75
but performance only gets you so far
let's return to the questionable
keyboard and trackpad placement I'm
actually gonna let Alex who did up the
review on this field this bit over the
last two years here I've used a ton of
laptops and I have to say this design
choice of putting the key word rig here
is not nearly as bad as you think like
you doesn't get on your lap
is a really bad time and so is going
from one side of the screen to the other
with this trackpad but beyond that I'm
always surprised by how quickly using
the trackpad on the right of the laptop
becomes natural to me after a day of
using the zephyrus I suspect you'll be
reaching for the numpad on other laptops
instead of the usual trackpad placement
the only real improvement I would have
made is to bring back the front fire and
speakers from the last efforts and use
this space to make the trackpad even
wider but Linus and I ended up just
debating of whether we'd end up giving
up the surprisingly good sound quality
asus has been able to squeeze in here
one thing we agree on for sure though is
the quality of the keyboard it's got a
bit of an unusual feel but the strokes
while short have a nice tactile feel and
the keycap stabilization is well above
average making it pretty forgiving for
inaccurate typists it's solid and Asus
was actually particularly proud of their
volume knob which really does have quite
a nice feel and satisfying click for
mute ok alright so that's all fine and
good but the biggest problem with the
Zephyrus has always been its portability
its small yes light ish but the last
model had a Wimpy fifty-three watt hour
battery that struggled to get three
hours of light to moderate use in our
testing to address this shortcoming asus
has finally up to the battery capacity
to 76 watt hours now to get the most out
of it you're gonna have to make some
tweaks you're gonna want to switch out
of dedicated GPU mode which means
disabling g-sync
and allowing the Intel I GPU to takeover
for later tasks and of course you're
gonna have to dial back your RGB and not
the screen refresh rate down to 60 Hertz
but if you do all these things it adds
up to letting this guy run for about
five hours on battery with light to
moderate use not too shabby
and the type-c USB charging also helps
in this regard because it allows you to
pack a much smaller 65 watt charger if
you don't plan on gaming saving you a
pound or two and you
backpack so as long as you have a desk
wherever you're planning on working the
Sepphoris is now a much more compelling
option than ever before ask for
upgradability well no one's perfect
opening it up and replacing the RAM or
storage is possible but there's only one
RAM and one m2 slot making upgrades more
wasteful and therefore expensive which
in turn makes it harder for us to
recommend these specs down versions of
this guy if there's any chance that you
might need to upgrade them later which I
guess brings us to the conclusion for
our model here coming in and an
eye-watering 3300 u.s. dollars it's
expensive so if you want something
cheaper the msi gs70 5 is a solid option
and the Zephyrus jacks 531 still gets
you the same CPU for about $1,300 less
but the GX 701 still walks out of here
with a solid recommendation thanks to a
Seuss's zero compromise approach to
cooling battery life and build quality
with extra marks for the Pantone
calibrated display did you ever wonder
what's actually wrong with your car when
the check engine light is on can mean
almost anything well the fixed
translates your vehicle's issues into
simple to understand terms for your
Android or iOS device to show you via
their app so this allows you to know
more about the inner workings of your
vehicle helping you feel more empowered
and less intimidated when you're
confronted with an automotive issue it
also explains your trouble codes keeps
track of where items reminds you when
your vehicle is due in for maintenance
