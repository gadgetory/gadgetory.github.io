hooked up we've got the two fans blowing
up full speed in a push-pull
configuration it is quite loud as I
mentioned before there you can see the
updated Corsair cpu block / pump unit so
I'm just coming around to this side so
you can get a better look at it alright
then we've got the the flexible hose
barbs along with the rotary fittings
that's the word I was looking for that
will that will rotate according to where
you want to mount your fan radiator unit
now you're going to see performance it
is quite a bit better than the advantage
unit and the reason for that is because
of just the basic laws of physics here
compare the radiator size whoops ok
they're compare the radiator size you
can see the h70 radiator is about three
times thicker than the Vantage radiator
and it just comes down to the basics of
how much surface area is there how much
heat can you dissipate well there you go
so that's why the advantage didn't get
much of a benefit from two fans but the
age 70 does because you actually need a
lot more static pressure to push the air
through such a thick radiator and get
all that cooling potential out of it so
as the last comparison I'm going to
throw a decent high-end air cooler on
here and see how that compares to the
h70 as well as to the cool advantage I'm
just dismantling the age 70 right now
and I thought I'd actually give kulit
major props for their for their mounting
system which is so easy you just you
just align the little bolt through on
the top so you just align it with the
line for which which mounting mechanism
you need 1366 1157 775 and then they
have three separate batch plates for all
three and then they've got like these
great thumb screws that you can use to
bolt it on and the Corsair one while
it's very secure and attached as well
and all of that good stuff it's a little
bit finicky you have to put it together
you have to put these little plastic
clips in then you have to thread the
script screws through and then you get a
like kind of position the whole thing in
the right place and then you get to use
a screwdriver it has
thumbscrews you got to insert the little
pegs in the back of the back plate it's
not really very intuitive like I said
once it's on it looks good and it's very
secure but it could use a little bit of
use of use ease abuse work alright so
now we've got a knock to it nhu 12 p on
the bench i'm using those same course
our fans because i want this to be as
much an apples-to-apples comparison as
possible so you can see there I've got
the end of course they're fun and down
on the other side now what I want you to
note first of all is the size so look at
the density of the fins on there look at
the density of the fins on the noctua
look at the approximate physical sizes
of the two units you can see they are
quite similar now what you're about to
see may shock you the NOC to a unit
performs not as well as the age 70 all
right so it's about five degrees higher
than the age 70 but that is to be
expected given that it is not optimized
for high RPM fans it is actually
optimized for low RPM fans so if we were
to take a cooler which I probably should
have done in retrospect that has a more
densely packed fin arrangement we'd
probably actually see similar
performance to the age 70 now that's not
to say that the age 70 doesn't have a
place in the world because the reality
of it is that coolers like the Vantage
with their LCD screens they're
programmable a wireless communication
system for lights and other cooling
devices in your system have a place they
are they belong with people who are more
worried about the features then the
maximum possible overclocked coolers
like the age 70 I mean really at five
degrees better than this particular
tower cool way that puts it right up
there in the top of air coolers so you
know that's an impressive feat in itself
and in a nice compact package that
allows you to a ship your system if you
need to so if you're buying a system
online the age 70 is a great choice
because it's much less likely to come
dislodged because it doesn't have as
much weight hanging off the cpu socket
and it also allows you to oh wait hold
on i was gonna say something else right
yeah it allows you to take your your
cooling element so your your cooling
radio
later whether it's a radiator on a cpu
heatsink or a radiator with water
flowing through it and put it right at
the back of the case where you can take
nice fresh air and use that to cool it
so you can get better cpu temperatures
at the cost of slightly worse internal
case temperatures so thank you for
checking out my little review i'm
actually not going to bother with the
graph after all because i showed you
guys the temperatures in fact here i'll
even you know what here's how I'll do my
graph NH dash you 12 p ok and then that
one was but 73 281 so i'll show you guys
the cooling performance that i had
written down so you can see the vantage
with its stock fan was a little bit
higher than the Vantage with dual fans
the age 70 is the big winner in terms of
performance although it is quite
expensive and then the nhu 12 p I
believe that's the SE two or something
like that was somewhere in between but
you have the convenience of it just
being an air cooler and just strapped to
the cpu heatsink brackets CP mounting
holes that's what i was looking for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
