brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX so Seagate slash list sees
demo might seem like an odd place to
kick off our CES coverage but they've
got some stuff inside that looks pretty
cool it all starts here though with
their living logo thing actually that's
exactly what they call it sweet I got it
right so living logo is there like
patented idea of having their their new
corporate logo and I'm gonna try and do
this there we go there it is as like a
living visualization of the data from a
particular feed let's say Instagram
Twitter New York Times you punch it to
change I just changed over to Twitter so
if I tweet a picture of my bum in theory
I can get it to show up on that screen
if I use the right hashtag but they've
asked me very nicely not to do that so
Seagate's marketing for this is grow
seven the seven IRA 7 8 7 out of 7 I
think are something along those lines it
would have sounded a lot better if this
was an 8 millimeter thick drive but it
is unfortunately 7 millimeters thick now
what they've done to achieve this is
they've gone with a 5 millimeter Design
Drive so it's a 500 gigabyte capacity
and then by using a very unique 1 mil
thick on either side steel enclosure
they've managed to achieve the same drop
rating resistance and all that stuff
they told me I could drop it I mean I'm
sure you wouldn't want to do that on a
drive anymore than you absolutely have
to as their regular drives which are
typically anywhere from twice as thick
or even more what's really cool is that
for contrast
they've actually got right next to it so
here's the 5 millimeter drive that
powers this bad boy this is a 35 year
old Drive that is 5 megabytes that is
obviously a lot thicker than 5
millimeters thick it's powered by a
standard 4 pin molex goes to show you
that power connectors been around for a
while but other than that this thing is
completely alien looking technology to
me and this was manufactured for IBM way
back 35 years ago I mean some of the
stuff is hand done there's
and soldered wires on the bottom of this
drive pretty freakin cool I geeked out
over this one over here we've got some
consumer and prosumer stuff so first up
is the personal cloud which is available
in a one Bay or two Bay configuration
and the objective here is something that
I've seen attempted many times but
rarely with much success so basically
the idea is you've got either one or two
drives the dual drive one will
automatically be configured in RAID one
for your protection and what it'll do is
it'll allow you to select folders and
have those ones backup to a cloud-based
storage it'll allow you to stream to
something like a Roku for example or a
chromecast so you can manage all your
media on your TV in that regard and the
last one is that it actually backs up
all of your PCs and even things like
phones and fun drives if you can figure
it all within their app of course I
haven't tested any of this and maybe
Seagate will give us a chance to check
it out because it sounds pretty good the
other consumer II thing that we've got
here is an update to their previous
generation Wireless of streaming drives
that's not so much newer and faster and
more amazing but definitely more
affordable so this is simply named the
Seagate wireless and Lord forbid they
ever release anything else that's ever
Wireless ever again because that's gonna
get really confusing but pretty much it
streams to three devices it's got 500
gigs of storage and it's got a very
friendly look to it lasts for about six
to eight hours on battery according to
the folks here now the next one we've
got is actually more of a product update
than strictly speaking a whole new idea
the list see rugged raid which is more
of an update to their previous single
drive products and I guess I kind of
gave away what exactly they changed
about it this is a dual drive rugged
Drive version it's not exactly strictly
speaking consumer this is more for your
prosumers but it's got a couple of cool
features so aside from having two hard
drives inside it's got Thunderbolt or
USB 3 and Thunderbolt requires no
auxiliary power it is completely bus
powered in order to run it off a
thunderbolt although for USB 3 you will
need an additional power adapter and
it's got a hardware RAID controller
inside which means you can configure it
and raid 0 or raid 1 although I'd say if
you're so concerned about your data that
you're buying like you know an inch and
a half thick rubber enclosure for it you
should probably be running raid one so
it's
nice and safe and here's the star of the
show this is the list see mirror and it
kind of breaks the mold a little bit
when I say mirror I don't mean
redundancy and it's not particularly
thin and it's not particularly rugged
like the other stuff they were showing
off this one is all about style so it's
not targeted at me and I wouldn't be
able to with a straight face say thanks
to the $600 that Lisi slipped into my
back pocket I endorsed this drive for me
personally this is not gonna be the
ticket because I'm more about looking at
the cost per dollar part of the equation
as opposed to the does this thing look
amazing on my desk even the box itself
like opens in this unique way so it's
not really targeted at me because it's a
280 dollar one terabyte drive but what
it is is it's something that feels a
little bit different than a typical hard
drive that's what they were going for
and I'd say mission accomplished you
guys the one thing I certainly
appreciate is that even though it's a
shiny piece of technology
they've got Gorilla Glass on it so it
should be slightly more fingerprint
resistant than most shiny things
although that doesn't mean that they
don't include a cleaning cloth in the
box it doesn't mean they don't want to
have one here handy at the kiosk to keep
these things all shined up so my lovely
assistant here from Lissy has been
showing us around to all the you know
bear drives and external drives and
suddenly I I blurted out well can you
show me your racks and she kind of goes
what I'm sorry if I made you really
uncomfortable because what I actually
meant was these racks yes over here this
is the stuff that I really geek out over
they've got the business storage for bay
rack Mountain as so this is I think it's
pretty self-explanatory I told them they
should have an easier name for it they
should call it like the the tiger claw
or something like that but basically
it's a for baked business mats and they
got one down here that I personally am
interested in for the first time as far
as anything Thunderbolt goes because I'm
more of a 10 Gigabit Ethernet kind of
guy but this right here is the lesea
eight big rack Thunderbolt 2 things so
basically what you can do is if eight
drives per one you you go ahead and rack
mount these and then you
actually daisy-chain up to six of them
together which is going to give you 48
drives potentially on a single pool to
Ray and then what you can actually do is
use a little Mac Mini as a Gigabit
Ethernet network share for it so it's
not just limited to thunderbolt access
you can also actually share it over the
network it's still not quite what I'd
want I would like to see every shared
resource have ten gigabit connectivity
to every computer but it is a huge step
in the right direction and if you're
looking for something that is just
wicked crazy stupid fast this is pretty
much it they had files copying on here
at three gigabytes per second which is
gonna be enough not just for an
individual user not just five users but
you could run many many users off an
array like that at a time so I think
that pretty much wraps it up for Seagate
endlessy thank you very much for being a
good sport about that that whole
business there I'm very sorry
so I just want to take a moment now to
thank our sponsors for allowing us to be
here at the show it's Phantom glass so
the ultimate protector for your phone I
should probably hold up my phone when I
do this Gorilla Glass 3 protectors that
go on over your phone they've got a nano
coating so you'll have absolutely no
bubbles guaranteed every time as well as
HyperX make sure you check out the
HyperX youtube channel they've got a lot
of great gaming content on there you
guys aren't going to want to miss it so
that's stored on phantom dot glass and
hyper X on YouTube you'll find links to
those in the video description below
don't miss any of our CES coverage so
make sure you're subscribed to all those
videos come into your feed just like
that
it's like how the internet works it's a
bit of a simplistic explanation</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
