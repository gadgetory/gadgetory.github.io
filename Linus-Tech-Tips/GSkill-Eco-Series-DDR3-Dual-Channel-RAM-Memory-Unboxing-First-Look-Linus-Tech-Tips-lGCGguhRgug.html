of a cool product from g.skill this is
their Kiko series Wren and I realize
yeah it's more unboxing ran and there's
not a whole lot to talk about about RAM
but what I want you to note about this
packaging is that they've gone and
they've colored it green now Green is a
common theme out there right now for
computer parts people are bringing down
people are demanding parts with lower
power consumption while still demanding
higher performance in general so the Eco
kit that we're looking at today what
makes this kit green is the fact that it
actually uses very very low voltages to
achieve its operating speed so this
particular kit that I'm looking at right
here is actually a ddr3 1600 megahertz
kit so it's a reasonable speed cast
latency of seven that's fairly good as
well but what's really exceptional about
it is it runs at one point three five
bolts even a few months ago a stick like
this would have definitely been running
at one point six five because the
bidding just wasn't that good yet for
ddr3 modules now you can have a look at
the heat spreader here it's a fairly bog
standard heat spreader you got your
g.skill logo here you got kind of a cool
you know blady wavy sort of design the
top has little ventilation holes you can
see our oh yeah no it's applied properly
yeah it just hooks in at either end and
then there's little holes so it's a dual
channel kit that means that it is
optimized for ah sorry I'm still in like
my June strip here so that means it is
optimized for the core i5 core i7 LGA
1156 platform and the reason the g.skill
has been working so hard to drive down
voltage first with an update to the
Ripjaws series and then with this new
eco series is that the core i5 and core
i7 CPUs with their integrated memory
controller will actually last much
longer
the lower the memory voltage you use so
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and product overview of the g.skill eco
series Ram</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
