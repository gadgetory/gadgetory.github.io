in person was at CES this year and man
did they have a cool demo running they
had quadcopters flipping and spinning
and dancing and at one point we even saw
a pretty spectacular crash although we
didn't get it on camera unfortunately
and why I actually haven't really gotten
into a lot of the more advanced quads
that have come out over the last year or
so with the most sophisticated flyer in
my fleet being an aerodrome 2.0 the
bebop piqued my interest and I asked
parrot to send over a sample so I could
put it through the paces for you and for
those of you asking because I'm sure
it's all over the place yes scrapyard
wars 1c is going to contain the epic
conclusion and it's coming out next
Saturday night but first this video
save on select until 730 series SSDs
with instant rebates during presidents
week February 22nd to March 1st 2015
click now to learn more so I got the sky
controller package and this is a must in
my opinion since it dramatically
increases the range and ease of control
of the be-bop compared to using the
Wi-Fi antenna and on-screen controls on
your tablet or smartphone and the
out-of-the-box experience was actually
really really good mostly the included
documentation is abominable
but everything was nicely packaged and
environmentally and cat stomach friendly
paper material and unlike many hobbyist
grade products it really comes with
everything you need to get started the
bebop drone the sky controller 3 1200
milliamp hour lipo batteries - for the
drone and one for the sky controller a
charger for the batteries a full set of
replacement propellers with a tool to do
it a hole to protect the props from
damage when flying indoors or near
obstructions a micro USB cable and neck
strap and then awesome and essential
when you want to use first-person view
on a bright day foldable sunshade with
an iPad Mini adapter so you can use it
with a full sized tablet or a smaller
one so let's start with a closer look at
the bebop itself the four motors have
been upgraded to brushless compared to
the ar.drone 2.0 Parrott has added eight
gigs of on-board storage about enough
for three flights worth of video and
some photos from the 14 megapixel camera
speaking of which the camera now
features a 180 degree fisheye lens Full
HD 1080p recording and an unbelievable
virtual gimbal stabilization setup that
makes first-person piloting a bit more
challenging more on that later but
allows the bebop to deliver some
astounding aerial footage on the back is
the power button and a micro USB
connector for offloading footage to a
computer although this can be done over
Wi-Fi and then on the underside is an
ultrasonic sensor for low altitude
height detection and a smaller camera to
control drift and measure speed along
with a couple of landing gear mounted
antennas rubber Isolators that will
provide some impact absorption in
crashes
we'll keep the motor vibration away from
the rest of the internals because as
interesting is what I've said so far may
actually be that is where the bebop got
most of its upgrades it now features a
dual-core cortex a9 CPU a quad-core GPU
whatever that means AC wireless a three
axis magnetometer a 3-axis gyroscope a
three axis accelerometer and a pressure
sensor lets it know how high it is once
the ultrasonic sensor gets out of range
of the ground gps is now built in out of
the box so you can see a little map of
where you went if you sign up for a
parrot account and it can return home
with a dedicated button oh yeah and the
bebop runs a Linux operating system with
an open source SDK in the works Wow and
the sky controller is actually much more
than a couple of joysticks with an
adjustable tablet or phone mount - I
mean it has that you know the right
stick does forward backward and
side-to-side movement while the left one
controls alte - Dan rotation or yaw but
there's other stuff too it's got its own
Android equipped computer inside with
GPS HDMI out for head mounted displays a
USB port for optional accessories down
the line and even head tracking for your
HMD a microUSB port for applying updates
a serious business Wi-Fi antenna that
increases the range from pretty fun -
holy crap this thing goes really far
away like a hundred and fifty meters up
in the air with a live video feed that's
actually working not half bad it's got
battery and Wi-Fi strength indicators
record and still image capture buttons
and joystick for panning around the
recorded camera view - but enough of
that what is it like to fly the answer
is really really fun I've always kind of
liked RC stuff I've got a dx7 radio and
su-26 ready to fly in a blade MSR that I
can sort of fly but helis are hard and I
kind of suck at it and compared to those
the bebop is really stable and really
easy to handle almost to the point where
it's kind of boring weight line is
boring you just said it was fun yes I'm
getting to that flying around staring at
the drone is okay but
about as exciting as flying a kite for
10 minutes if you're not a die-hard
RC aircraft person because there's
really not much challenge in it the
bebop with some exceptions that I'll get
into a bit more later pretty much just
goes where you put it and then stays
there but even though I just spent the
last minute griping about what I'd like
to be better your focus shouldn't be on
the complaints but rather on what kinds
of complaints they are none of these are
show stoppers that will lend the bebop
permanently in my closet collecting dust
their usability tweaks that I really
want to see addressed because this thing
is so much fun and I want my experience
using it all the time to be as smooth as
possible and I have a lot of hope for it
rift dk2 doesn't support first-person VR
operations I couldn't try it but the
consumer one which I am getting will I
am stoked to play with that and parrot
opening things up to the open-source
community has already resulted in some
cool mods like this users on the pair
forum who figured out how to turn the
gimbal off for more true to what the
bebop is seeing first-person view and
this other one with LEDs added for
better visibility of the drones
orientation in the sky so is the bebop
the best drone for the price at nine
hundred dollars with the sky controller
I don't know this is my first kick at
the can for anything better than toy
grade is it a really really cool gizmo
that's going to provide hours of fun for
me and my son when we want to go out and
do something on the weekend yeah it is
speaking of something to do on the
weekend browsing the internet privately
tunnel bear is a consumer VPN company
with over 4 million users people use
tunnel there for all kinds of things
browsing the internet privately
unblocking websites we've got mobile and
desktop apps so they support iOS Android
PC Mac and Linux and they encrypt all of
your traffic so it can't be seen or
logged by governments ISPs and
corporations so all you need to do is
turn on tunnel there with a single click
of the on-off switch within the app and
you're pretty much ready to rock you can
tunnel to 13 different countries
depending on what it is you are trying
to access
or circumvent and they are serious about
collecting the minimum amount of
information possible oh man that that
pun gives like my puns a run for my
money anyway they're based in Canada
which means customers are protected by
some of the world's best consumer
privacy protection laws and they have
more than three times the Bears users of
any other VPN so you can check out the
link in the video description if you
want to learn more about tunnel bear use
offer code Linus TT for 20% off a
grizzly
it's an annual subscription of $39.99
the subscription will allow you to use
tunnel bear across any three devices so
guys also in the video description we
have a support us link which is a link
to our forum where you can discuss this
video rather than doing it in the
YouTube comments it's better and where
you can buy a cool t-shirt like this one
give us a monthly contribution or change
your amazon bookmark to one with our
affiliate code so we get a small
kickback well if you buy a bebop with it
it'll be a pretty large kickback so
thank you very much for using our
affiliate code for stuff like that I
think that pretty much wraps this up
like the video if you liked it dislike
it if you disliked it leave a comment on
the Linus tech tips forum if you'd like
for me or Luke to actually see it
because we're going to be making a point
of monitoring comments a little more
over there and a little less under
YouTube videos moving forward although
don't worry I'm not planning to turn
them off either thanks again for
watching
