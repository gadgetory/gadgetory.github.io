to CES 2016 this year check out their
link in the description down below which
is squarespace.com slash Linus and use
offer code Linus for 10% off so we're
here in the razor suite where they have
almost made the dreams that started
three years ago from you with the Magna
3 T external pci express Thunderbolt
enclosure come true and there's a couple
of different pieces to this story so
first up is the razor blade stealth this
is a twelve and a half inch ultra book
and yes I actually mean ultra book in
the certified sense of the word because
they did not go and put a dedicated
graphics card in here more on that later
so it's got its super thin its super
light the screen is gorgeous all that
stuff that you'd expect from an ultra
book and it does have intel onboard
graphics to go along with the onboard
graphics it's got a core I read you
eight gigs of RAM and then the storage
configuration is variable depending on
whether you buy on to buy an entry-level
SKU at $9.99 or go all the way up to the
$1600 model to get 512 gigs of PCI
Express space storage the entry level
one is 128
you also get screen upgrades as you move
up the pricing structure so you go from
quad HD all the way up to 4k on the top
two tiers of products now in terms of
the physicality of the device at $9.99
you'd expect it to be built pretty well
and honestly I think razor has done a
pretty good job of this in the past and
they continue to do a good job here the
aluminum construction is immaculate like
I just said before the screen looks
fantastic and I even think they did a
great job of the i/o they've got a USB
3.1 type-c connector that also handles
Thunderbolt three again more on that
later they've got two USB 3 ports as
well as an HDMI port and a dedicated
three-and-a-half millimeter audio jack
that's going to handle both your
headphones and your microphone but
that's really not the focal point for me
even though Razer isn't even talking
about pricing of this guy and they
really want the star of the show to be
the Ultrabook yes the Ultrabook is very
cool but what you can do with the
Ultrabook when you get back to your desk
is what really makes my nerd juices flow
this is
the razor core and is the answer to what
I would have wanted that magma 3t thing
to be so it uses a single Thunderbolt 3
connection to get at PCI Express 16x it
reports in GPU Z but it's running at
pcie 3.0 4x graphics card connected to
the system so you can have a full
discrete graphics card experience with
this system and do it with just a single
connector obviously you have to plug
this puppy into the wall to to power it
as well and the best thing about it is
that it's actually simple to upgrade as
well it's only a couple of screws in
fact you can open up the internals to
lessly
and boom you can pop in pretty much any
dual slot graphics card as long as it's
a fairly standard height pretty freakin
cool and the quality of the unit feels
amazing and actually from what I know
about the enhanced 500 watt power supply
that they've gotten there should be as
amazing as it feels I'm really excited
for what the future holds here
unfortunately razer won't confirm for me
whether we can get a compatible notebook
in the future from them that has a quad
core cpu in it huh but I have to hope
that the blade 14 and the larger blades
will also get upgraded to use this thing
because this is a pretty awesome way to
upgrade a laptop as you go so thanks for
watching this video here in the razor
suite don't miss any of our CES 2016
content by getting subscribed and a huge
thank you to Squarespace for sponsoring
us to be here remember guys if you want
