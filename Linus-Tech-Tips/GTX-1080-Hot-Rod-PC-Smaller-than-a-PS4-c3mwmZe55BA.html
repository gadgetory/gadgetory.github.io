viewer who suggested we take a look at
the s4 mini by NFC a completely unheard
of indie outfit run by this guy Josh
sniffing well I'm not sure what he's
been sniffing but it must be some pretty
good stuff because basically out of his
garage he is building what appears to be
by far the smallest case for custom
gaming PC Builders out there measuring
just two and a half inches thick the
diminutive s4 mini case pushes the
definition of small form-factor cases to
the absolute breaking point but will it
break when we try to cram a ZOTAC GTX
1080 and a core i7 7700 K into a system
that's even smaller than the PlayStation
4 there's only one way to find out
we're hosting LTX 2017 on July 29th 2017
it's a meet-up
Tech carnival thing and it's gonna be a
lot of fun
learn more at the link in the video
description distilling a gaming PC down
to this degree comes at a cost the s4
mini has no front io to speak of the CPU
cooler and RAM module clearance is 40
millimeters and GPU options that don't
require some creativity are pretty
limited thankfully more powerful mini
cards have come into fashion and our msi
gtx 1060 OC v1 fit quite easily without
even being so tight inside that we
couldn't fit two two and a half inch
drives which will take gladly but even
that it's probably not enough so what
other tricks did they use well unlike
OMS like MSI and ZOTAC the s4 mini uses
an off-the-shelf mini ITX motherboard
and a desktop graphics card but like
them they're relying on a main external
power brick with a high efficiency DC to
DC power supply mounted inside there are
a handful of options including some
lower-cost ones for more pedestrian
system configs but to give ourselves
some breathing room we are using a dell
330 watt brick with an HD plex 300 power
supply inside now without any
modifications we ended up with what we'd
consider to be a pretty decent machine
we've got a low voltage core i7 7700 t a
gtx 1060 16 gigs of vengeance lpx memory
and an MP 500 m2 SSD for speed and a
little bit of space savings behind the
video card and firing it all up we found
ourselves greeted with actually pretty
great thermal and acoustic performance
it's right in the middle of the other
competitors in our recent small
form-factor case roundup impressive
perhaps even most impressive but I
wouldn't call it a Jedi
that was another one of those stupid
looks great but can't perform cases
would I well good news my friends the
limit here is not our power supply or
our thermals thanks to the s4 minis
perforated side panels just volume so
let's see then how far we can push our
luck I mean if we look at our CPU
cooling results we've got a lot of
headroom there so step one we go ahead
and upgrade to a 7700 k as for the RAM
well come on
this stuff's clearly not cool enough for
a rig like this but ah a stroke of luck
Corsair contacted us and asked if we
wanted a sample of their new Dominator
Platinum special edition torque we took
one look at that stuff and said yeah
seriously
orange fins and labeling heat-treated
titanium styling on the top bar 32 gigs
of this was definitely worth the $75 we
paid to have Josh overnight ship us a
custom hot rod style side panel to go
with it moving on to the GPU while we
were scratching our heads trying to
figure out how to get something bigger
than a 1060 in here I mean we're kind of
coming to the point where we can almost
fit a card like so taks GT X 1080 mini
if only the case were a little bigger or
the card were a little smaller so if we
yes my friends I hope you saw this one
coming because we went there after
taking the plastic shroud off we
carefully trimmed down the rear of the
heatsinks fins as close to the heat pipe
as we dared to no not that closed
dang it Ivan so one quick call to ZOTAC
and another overnight shipment later and
it's time
for round two now we're talking now we
can get the card inside the s4 mini but
the stock cooling is still an issue but
if we can't fit an aqua F 12 maybe a
silverstone slim 120 mil on this mount
here will be enough fire up fur mark end
crap okay let's go back to the Noctua
and FF 12 I mean it's only a couple
millimeters off so I think you can see
where we're going with this we've shaved
off just enough to make it fit in under
the 120 mil fan mounts and make it fit
we did I mean this is Linus tech tips we
always fit it in there if you know what
I mean as for temperatures though we're
stable in the high 80s we made it work
but it was a little loud due to the lack
of clearance between the fan and the
side panel at about 50% fan speed though
we got to the point where our noise
level was acceptable without giving up
too much of our GPUs boost clock as for
the CPU with some careful under volting
and tweaking we got it to hold at 4.2 to
4.3 gigahertz boost under synthetic load
staying comfortably at 4.5 gigahertz
that is full turbo under lighter
workloads like games our Dominator
platinum torques didn't want to go past
20 400 megahertz but this is an X 99 kit
on a z170 board with a 7th gen chip so
we made up the difference by tightening
up the timings as far down as they'd go
and all of this taken together gives us
this tiny gaming rig whose only outward
indication of its potency is the baa Ram
vent and maybe the massive external
power brick so let's take a few moments
then to put into perspective the sheer
amount of raw power contained in this
little box we only planned to run a
couple of benchmarks you know just to
make sure that it was working okay but
we were so blown
way that we had to run more to make sure
we weren't dreaming our decked out as
for mini runs with the best single GPU
systems we've tested even beating out
our KB Lake bench system with a Founders
edition card thanks to the additional
turbo enabled by an overclocked card and
it comes in at the top of the pack for
what we've ever seen in terms of
performance per litre now at 195 US
dollars not including the power supply
and without a fancy paint job not to
mention the fact that it's completely
sold out of pre-orders the s4 mini slots
in with the rest of our premium small
form-factor cases it's compact
reasonably lightweight features rugged
aluminum construction is near impossible
to actually buy and isn't the easiest
thing to work in but so far this is the
closest I think I've seen to the idea
that I pitched to Coolermaster four
years ago and to say I love it would be
an understatement
tunnel bear is the simple to use VPN app
that literally takes this long to turn
on boom the app loads up you go okay yet
that's the country I want you click one
button it BAM no DNS settings and ports
forwarding or any of that kind of
nonsense and once you turn tunnel bear
on you get a couple of key benefits your
connection gets encrypted keeping your
traffic safe and private from your
internet provider advertisers etc and
you appear to the websites and online
services you're using as though you are
in a different country getting you
around
pesky geo restrictions so try it out
with 500 megabytes of data for free and
no credit card required and then if you
choose to get a year of unlimited data
save 10% by go on a tunnel bear comm
slash ltte so thanks for watching guys
that this video sucked you know what to
do but if it was awesome get subscribed
hit that like button and maybe check out
