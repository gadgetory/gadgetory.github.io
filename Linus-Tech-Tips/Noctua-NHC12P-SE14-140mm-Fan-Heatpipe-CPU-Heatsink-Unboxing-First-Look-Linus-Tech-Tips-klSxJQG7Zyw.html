knock to a cooler the reason that I'm
looking at both of these is they both
launched fairly close together and the
reason for that is that Noctua just
launched their 140 mm fan so this is an
updated version of the NHC 12 p and it
is the SE 14 which as you may or may not
have guessed stands for special edition
14 centimeter fan okay so there you go
so let's get this open this is not a
tower heatsink this is actually a more
traditional blowing down style of
heatsink and the reason for that is not
everybody has room in their case for
these giant Tower heat sinks that go out
on the side of your motherboard I mean
the one that we unboxed recently the the
D 14 is just huge and you don't always
have space for that you don't always
have clearance so a more pop down design
is good for that and it's also good if
you need more cooling for the
surrounding components around your
motherboard because the fan will
actually contribute to MOSFET cooling as
well as RAM cooling all that other stuff
the trade-off is that it doesn't cool
the CPU quite as well which many people
are happy to make so let's dive into the
accessories here first we have a metal
Nachtwey case badge very classy very
stylish then we have their low noise and
ultra-low noise adapters so 7 and 5
volts basically then we have a couple of
fan clips and a tube of their nth one
thermal compound which you will need to
spread on the CPU then we have the AMD
mounting hardware okay so there SEC you
firm mounting system includes both AMD
and Intel this Intel mounting hardware
you can see by all the different
mounting holes here is actually good for
775 1156 and 1366 it uses all thumb
screws and stuff very nice I love to see
that and then they've done their classy
little manual thing here where you open
it up and you got the Intel instructions
in one side and the AMD structions
instruct AMD structions AMD instructions
on the other side very cool it's all
color coded I should probably just do a
quick show that really quickly here so
they show you all the different steps
and colors should be quite simple to
install like all of their coolers have
been in the
past okay so let's get down to the c12
PST 14 here if I can figure out how to
get the Box open then that'd be a major
stride for me okay so it actually ships
okay with you able to see the 140
millimeter fan through the front now
this 140 millimeter fan is a pretty new
product for Noctua unlike all of the
other 140 ml fans on the market it uses
a circular frame and the reason they've
done that is because it actually has 120
millimeter mounting holes now if you buy
the for the fan stand alone you can
actually get 140 millimeter adapters but
it's pretty cool that they allow you to
mount a larger fan on a smaller mounting
hole okay they ship it with a little
piece of plastic I like attention to
detail like this I'd love to see this
between the fins and the fan so that
nothing gets scratched you don't get any
plastic junk residue coming off on your
fins keeps it nice and pristine looking
so let's have a look at the cooler
itself you've got okay nickel plated
copper base which will do the the
obligatory finger shot to show the
shininess now it's not particularly
reflective but not - it takes great
pride in how flat their basis is their
bases are all your base something either
way reflectiveness is not necessarily an
indication of flatness so we have six
heat pipes coming in to the bottom here
which are all oriented to come up into
their sort of radiator array here now
I'm not sure why they've made this
design decision where they're leaving
out some of the fins here but I'm sure
there's a very good reason for it and I
just want to give you a couple more
angles here before we wrapped up our
unboxing so you can see the Noctua
branding there oh I see why they've done
it because these ones are connected
directly to the base I'm sorry I totally
missed that while blonde moment there
okay so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and product overview of the NHC
