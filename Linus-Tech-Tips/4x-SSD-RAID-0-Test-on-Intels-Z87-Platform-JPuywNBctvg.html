check the link in the video description
for more details now we all know SSDs
are pretty much the ultimate in terms of
performance on a desktop system for your
storage but what many of you probably
actually do know is that you can run
multiple SSDs together in raid 0 kind of
like SLI for SSDs
to get even better performance out of
them particularly in sequential read and
write operations
now it doesn't learn much like SLI it
doesn't necessarily scale perfectly it's
like if you run 16 SSDs in a system will
it performs 16 times better the answer
is no but without getting into expensive
fancy you hardware RAID cards or other
exotic solutions we wanted to find out
where exactly is the limit in scaling
for SSDs
running on a regular Intel desktop PC we
chose this platform because it has 6
SATA 3 6 gigabit per second ports
running off of the Intel chipset the
last generation z77 only had 2 so it was
really hard to do this kind of an
investigative thing so we decided to run
for different configurations by the way
big thanks to a data for providing these
SX 900 Sam force based SSDs for our test
we ran single drive to drive three drive
and four drive I lost the last box I
have no idea where it is so don't worry
trust me we definitely ran four drives
they're all there and we wanted to see
where the differences in performance
really start well disappearing so to
speak so we ran three different
benchmarks we ran PC mark Vantage so we
ran the storage subsystem test and what
you'll see here is that it becomes quite
clear very quickly that just because you
double the theoretical performance of
one aspect of your system doesn't mean
that you're necessarily going to double
the real-world performance because PC
mark is more of a real-world oriented
test we also see that that small
performance difference evinced continues
to diminish as we have more and more
drives giving us that sort of all it
adheres to the law of diminishing
returns just like you'd see with adding
more channels to memory operation or
adding more graphics cards to
a lie or crossfire config now when we
move on to a synthetic test we ran both
reads and writes peds using the black
magic disk speed test which we found to
be quite repeatable and quite realistic
in terms of theoretical maximums you'll
see that once again we see a very clear
doubling of performance going from a
single drive to a two drive
configuration but once we get into these
multi drive configs three drives still
scales extremely well but adding a
fourth drive really doesn't do a whole
lot for even theoretical performance so
while you'll still get extra capacity
when you run for 256 gig SSDs in raid 0
you get effectively one terabyte of
capacity you won't necessarily continue
to get a speed improvement and you
should also be aware that every time you
add another SSD you are adding to the
points of failure that exist in your
system and increasing the risk that just
by a single drive failing you will lose
all of your data if you aren't doing
very regular backups so thank you for
checking out this raid zero performance
investigation with the a day 2 SX 900
SSDs don't forget to subscribe to Linus
tech tips from our unboxings reviews and
other computer videos give the video a
like if you liked it give a dislike if
you disliked it or you're having a bad
day or you didn't like the serial your
mum bought from the grocery store and
you just wish you bought something else
