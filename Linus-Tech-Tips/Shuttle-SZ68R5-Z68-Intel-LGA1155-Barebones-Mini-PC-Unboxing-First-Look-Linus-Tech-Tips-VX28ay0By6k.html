but in Vancouver houses are really
expensive and saw our apartments and so
are condos and dogs and actually no dogs
are more expensive but places to live
are certainly more expensive so having a
smaller computer is probably a good
thing today I have an unboxing of a very
fully featured small form-factor
computer from shuttle although there's
no actual functional computer in this
box this is a bare-bones which means you
have to add a CPU memory a drive an
operating system and I guess that's
pretty much it so basically what it is
is a motherboard a case and the power
supply now what's cool about this
product to me is the fact that it is the
first one that both the crazy Russian
and myself have directly influenced
during the design phase
so when shuttle did their age 67
bare-bones we suggested to them that
because LGA 1155 produces such low power
and yet capable gaming CPUs they should
make the system a little bit more gaming
capable themselves by adding additional
capacity to the power supply so shuttle
went ahead and took our suggestion and
ran with it I mean we like to think it
was we were the only ones who suggested
it but we probably weren't so with the
chip our suggestion and run with it and
this bare-bones
computer actually includes a beefy
enough power supply that you could
install a fairly high powered graphics
card in it so check this out this is an
80 plus bronze where are we here I
remember someone told me already what it
is and I know that it's beefy but I
don't know exactly what the capacity is
we're gonna have to find this out in a
sec so yes it is a 500 watt continuous
power supply which means yes you can
throw a quad-core CPU in here no problem
you can throw a decent graphics card and
here's also no problem and you can load
it up to the gills with all the hardware
you want with yes
once again no problem so I'll show you
guys the basics of the inside so right
here you've got support for two three
and a half inch drives as well as some
do not eat silica gel let's go ahead and
slide this baby back you've also got
support for one five and a quarter inch
drive so you just mount everything on to
this right here and then slide the whole
thing back in it comes with two SATA
cables your thermal compound your
mounting screws your socket cover as
well as your power cable and your
full-color quick installation guide once
you get the drives out of the way you
can actually see the rest of the
internals so here we go here is our
front USB 3 which is included and
already even plugged in with the unit
here's our front USB 2 as well as our
front panel audio I'll show you guys the
front panel in just a moment here's all
of the rest of our internal connectors
so let's see what we got here you guys
we've got ha check this out that's right
dual PCIe one eight pin one six pin very
very nice we've also got support for one
two three four SATA connectors so that
means you can throw a bunch of two and a
half inch drives and run like a raid
array off them or something if you want
we've got two ma molex for pins and one
floppy connector coming off this power
supply that is in addition to the home
and look at this it's got an 8 pin CPU
power connector over here so they're
only using four pins because that's all
we really need for this as well as the
24 pin connector so that is a truly
beefy power supply we've also got a very
capable looking cooling system on the
vrm here and I think that pretty much
covers the power side of things so
shuttle has also I mean along the lines
of making this very capable of putting a
very capable machine inside included
four dimm slots for SATA connectors as
well as a couple of mini PCIe connector
here so you could put like a Wi-Fi card
here look at that
it also oh look at Intel SRT support and
say to only well very neat so they've
included that functionality as well see
that's the thing about a small form
factor desktop is the kind of stuff
that's normally reserved for notebooks
tends to tends to find its way in there
so just for heat reasons I really don't
think that I I would expect to put
anything bigger than about a GTX 560 in
here even though the reality of it is
with a 500 watt power supply you could
probably do like a dual-core in a 570 I
still wouldn't really recommend that but
I'm gonna go ahead and show you guys how
will 560 will fit then I'm gonna put the
case back on and then I will show you
the outside of the unit now that we blow
we should look at the cooling solution
first sorry guys so it uses pushpins
which are not my favorite but as long as
you're only going to use it a couple
times I guess it's not the end of the
world and then there are three heat
pipes that lead up to what appears to be
a 92 millimeter cooling fan which has a
shroud sort of functionality built into
it so it's a little distance away you
can see the shroud here from a radiator
that sits right at the back of the unit
so the entire unit is cooled by this fan
and this fan this one for the CPU and
this one for the power supply so let's
go ahead and show you guys how easy it
is to install a graphics card in here I
have no idea I'm just assuming that it's
easy based on shuttles that I've used in
the past being fairly easy to install
things and in spite of their small
stature correctly push down on it and
there we go so you can see that there is
plenty of room for my graphics card even
once I have installed let's go ahead and
throw this baby back in here my hold on
have to give me a sec to get these
cables of the way guys the cards in the
drive tray is back in I'm just gonna
show you guys a quick view of what the
interior looks like once you've got that
card installed so yeah it's a little
cramped but that's sort of the reality
when you're running a tunnel PC so
here's the reason for my suggestion
you only really take it up as high as
maybe a GTX 560 rather than going all
the way to of those enthusiast class
cards and that is how much ventilation
space you're gonna have for that
graphics card so shuttle has in their
wisdom included ventilation holes right
here which means that those fans do have
direct access to cool air from the
outside which will then be exhausted
through the CPU heatsink and then out
the back of the case let's actually have
a closer look at the back of the case so
this is what it'll look like once you
install a graphics card remember this is
a z68 chipset so you do have support for
lucid logics Hydra that means Intel SRT
even if you do have a graphics card
installed because it does have onboard
video we've also got eSATA as well as
USB to USB 3 Gigabit Ethernet a clear
CMOS button which is kind of unique to
see on like I mean you would typically
expect these smaller form factor
machines to be more value oriented but
there you go
it's there cool as well as our back
Audio 7.1 we've also got spit if that's
optical audio out our power in so that's
on the back of the power supply and
moving over long to this side we've got
a nice brushed metal finish this is sort
of my expectation with shuttle they do a
good job of the finish of their machines
you can see the top as well and then
let's have a look at the front of the
box so this auj cotton sorry I pushed it
in there's nothing there's nothing
resisting it right now because there's
no optical drive installed so that's
that's the problem there we've got room
for no is there space four to five and a
quarter inch drives would appear that
there is let me find that out for you oh
no there isn't here we go here we go so
that's where you can put like a media
card reader or something like that okay
and then here we've got our front panel
so that's front panel USB three that's a
total of four USB 3 ports two USB 2 and
there's your microphone jack remember
there wasn't one on the back it is on
the front as well as your front
headphone port so you can see gorgeous
little brushed finish on the front here
as well so thank you for checking out oh
there's your power button just like that
thank you for checking out my unboxing
and first look at I never actually even
said the model this is the shut
s z68 RS don't forget to subscribe to
Linus tech tips from our unboxings
reviews and yeah that's the box for it
thank you very much for that and other
