pretty typical room scale VR setup you
got your light stands you got your
cables running everywhere extension
cords all that kind of stuff and
honestly it's fine as long as you're the
type of self-aware nerd here let's look
at what else we got here got a computer
that is comfortable running HDMI cables
and Ethernet cables all along their
floors but let's say your girlfriend
comes over your grandma or you want to
have company over the first thing
they're gonna say is what is all this
junk so today we are gonna be creating a
stealthy VR setup sponsored by oculus
so step one for getting a VR set up less
intrusive looking is getting rid of the
support pillars which usually means
getting your cameras mounted on either
the top part of the wall or a ceiling
where they'll look kind of like you know
a security camera or a piece of tape or
nothing and they'll draw this attention
but the problem is cable management even
with our computer right next to this
camera right here we have no extra
length left in order to do any cable
management and usb3 is extremely
sensitive to increases in length and the
signal degradation that goes along with
that so because these cameras are
actually pretty high bandwidth devices
we're gonna need thank you Alex some of
these these are USB 3 active extension
cables which act as a signal repeater
rather than just you know extra length
of copper wire so that we can maintain
the signal integrity for that camera
that's not open and look it's the worst
kind it's the kind that splinters apart
into a hundred pieces when you try to so
position wise have we decided on this
for our three camera setup yeah all
three cameras are perfectly working as
is and there's tape on the ceiling as
you can see for the positions when we
actually mount them up there okay so
there's a couple of advantages to having
three rather than two cameras for an
oculus VR setup because you can
triangulate the position of the touch
controllers and the headset you actually
get aside from the ability to turn
around and maintain your tracking you
actually get more accurate tracking for
room-scale gaming and I mean as much as
we want to build a stealth setup we also
want to build a no compromises gaming
setup so we just need to mount some
cameras oh yeah yeah okay let's do it
well we need a PC in the ceiling also
why cuz then it's a totally stealth you
don't have wires going up and you want
to hide the monitor yeah the monitors
gonna be hind a mirror so you can't see
it alone I mean okay cool so we have the
benefit of doing this project in an
office which means we've got a drop
ceiling so come to
so simply by lifting up and then there's
ducting over there okay there's a lot of
crap up here actually but by just
lifting up these tiles we get access to
about looks like about 18 inches of
space up here where we could actually
put I don't know if it's to code but but
we can put the computer and monitor and
everything else associated with it up
here I mean I guess it's like it
shouldn't be a cooling issue up here
anything so for our system we're gonna
be using this MSI d25 it's got a core i7
8700 six core it's got a gtx 1070 most
importantly it's got easy plug for VR
and it's got lots of USB 3 ports because
when you're running extra cameras you
need lots of USB 3 ports preferably on a
couple of different controllers oh oh no
way no there's a power outlet up there
Oh awesome
so you check it out oh wow yeah now this
is what I'm talking about
like it's actual actually like proper
and everything well this is crazy
you know how much it would cost us at
this point to get something like that
put in like now after the fact like
hundreds and hundreds of dollars because
we'd have to run it from the transformer
which is the exact opposite corner of
this building ok let's do it I mean dude
we don't even need a long extension cord
anymore it was like 15 feet with power
taken care of we needed networking so
what we could do is this is terminated
in a female connector is we could just
jacket yeah alright
oh the whole thing ok ok yep thanks you
take it I got it you know ok this would
have to be pretty superhero mode for me
to actually get it all the way over
there I'm gonna try it's not sound
successful or was it now what so let's
get USB and HDMI over to here where the
display is going to be the display needs
to go all the way over here yeah well I
can't the display go over here because
you Vaughn thinks that a mirror would
look bad on that wall
hi I'm busy putting a USB and an HDMI
cable all the way from over here to over
there which is apparently your mandate
why can't we just do that well let's
just get the let's just get the wire run
okay it's a good thing I don't need to
be here very long
yeah it looks really bad Alex you're not
helping right now bros before hoes which
I can say cuz her last name is ho with
the computer up in the ceiling and
working I left Alex to get the sensors
off the floor using adhesive camera
mounts next up floor height HDMI and USB
ports for our headset after checking for
studs we killed the power to the library
and then got to cutting a hole in the
drywall but not to be defeated by the in
wall insulation we decided to jam a
meter stick with cables tape to the end
down the wall until it reached the
correct height now how are we supposed
to get this down there oh you know what
we might still be able to do it but
lower would have definitely been better
we can always make it bigger I know you
can always make a hole bigger I can't
tell if I'm just jamming down insulation
or if I'm actually wait no I think this
is feeding in no I think I'm just
dabbing it down our straight meter stick
couldn't fit between the insulation and
drywall but with some Canadian
engineering we solved that problem okay
Nassau and then wait a minute no this
isn't a drywall saw no totally sure no I
think we have a drywall saw this isn't
it we do but I couldn't find it okay so
yeah now I can mostly feel what's going
on here I think mmm no I can't really I
need a bigger hole I was kind of
thinking that you'd expand down yeah
there's just not enough weight my arm I
assumed that was the next step uh it'd
be about a meter down from me tumor me
and try going down sideways up through
for all time you know we're definitely
hitting something here and is what we're
hitting soft miss you're Alex it's all
the way in I'm pulling back out
okay so let's double check our leg care
after doing a trial round of our JAMA
ruler down the wall concept we were
ready for the real thing we want to
taper the end here for a smooth entry
wait okay this is a lot thicker than
what we put down there last time so the
trick last time was kind of wiggling it
back and forth until I could find the
right opening oh wow ah it's the first
time I've been elbow deep in the wall
this hole required a bit more finesse
than the last one since you'll actually
be able to see it so we marked it off
with tape and carefully cut thanks to my
small hands they're basically a super
power grabbing the cable was easy Oh
awesome yeah was easier than expected
nice and surprisingly enough the whole
thing worked now at this point the
screen was still sticking out like a
sore thumb so we went to the hardware
store and got a mirror to cannibalise I
just reminded me that picture frames
exist and probably would have worked a
lot better for this Ben we returned the
mirror and got a picture frame the front
of the display was removed then the
acrylic two-way mirror was cut to size
with some extra love from the belt
sander and then placed in our picture
frame with double-sided tape everything
was held together with some scrap wood
and a lot of glue then left to dry
overnight while the glue was drying
there was time to fix the big hole in
the wall we were able to get the proper
cover for HDMI but USB ended up getting
taken care of with duct tape not to
trust it was anything but now just a
couple finishing touches were left all
right
adding some wireless peripherals
bringing in the mirror hiding the wires
and wow this is a little crooked but
that's actually a lot crooked but that's
okay minor details and sort of like
jiggle it around and it'll go back yeah
okay that looks good though
look at that everything else completely
hidden away and this is the mirror
display yeah so the idea is that this
just kind of oh oh yeah it's attached
with wires yep those cables are those
cables are actually okay those cables
are reasonably well managed we could
probably stand a little bit of
improvement here but you can't you can't
really see them back here there's a lot
of glare it's it's a mirror it's very
mirror II okay tell me max you're more
qualified than me would this kind of
setup be more likely to get girlfriend
approval than what we had before
yeah cool so mission accomplished then
we've solved the two main problems with
deploying VR in the home number one
unsightly wires there is basically
nothing to be seen for our sensors or
for our headset whenever we aren't
actively using it thanks to this wall
plate and honestly about an hour to two
hours of running cables and number two
convenience we've got somewhere we can
store the whole setup and be up and
running in the time that you are about
to watch check this out
cable managed of five with my blindfold
on here get my touch controllers walk
over and plug in I am in VR and then
when I'm done put the whole thing away
completely stealthy even if we have any
issues with the setup all we got to do
is use our subtle 2-way mirror to kind
of recover bubbly whatever it is that's
going on and we're back up and running
