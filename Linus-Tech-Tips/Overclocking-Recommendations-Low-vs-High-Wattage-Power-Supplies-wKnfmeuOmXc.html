grade a power supply rail set up overall
wattage efficiency quality components
etc today we'll be doing this as a
thought experiment on the overabundance
of wattage and will it help you
overclock and if so by how much stay

episode on how to do cable lacing which

the Coolermaster Nova touch tkl utilizes

and is now available at a more
affordable price click now to learn more
to perform set thought experiment we
will be using i-264 stress test
functionality to push the CPU and fir
mark to push the GPU these programs
should ensure that we have quite a bit
of power generation from the various
parts on our test bench these these
programs to push our components as much
as we can using each power supply in
order to try to find that power supply's
limit in a sense and to see if having
more wattage will directly result in
higher overclocks or if the spacing
between power supplies is high enough
that getting a power supply that can
support your system will also just
naturally support an overclock for the
test bench itself we have an Asus x99
deluxe with a 59 60 X sitting
comfortably in its socket the 59 60 X
will run in a range of three 3.14 four
point one gigahertz and stock at stock
voltages and then 4.5 gigahertz at one
point three five volts for graphics
cards I'll be using the HD 7770 and r7
265 and r9 270x a GTX 770 at GTX Titan x
+ dual GTX Titan X's these cards will be
running at varying stock speeds and
varying overclocked speeds and we'll be
discussing how each power supply
performed with them but you can see
their overclock speeds in the dock down
below just in case they're maxed
overclock speeds we're going to start
off with a really low wattage power
supply a 300 watt sfx power supply from
silverstone as far as i'm concerned this
is the little power supply that could
the first set up we tried on it was
maxing out our HD 7770 and our 59 60 X
which was somehow able to do seriously
this thing is rated at 300 watts what
was somehow comfortably pulling 375
watts from the wall it even took an r7
265 in stride maxing it out but starting
to fail when we clocked the CPU above 4
gigahertz with the GPU maxed out in the
CPU at 4 gigahertz it was pulling about
360 watts from the wall again
comfortably with the 270 exit was able
to hit 12:45 core clock which isn't
quite our max overclock but it did do
this while pulling 320
watts from the wall as well for the card
when when we tried to increase clock
speeds on the CPU above stock they kind
of crashed which was kind of unfortunate
which ends the epic run of this power
supply as it didn't manage to boot a 770
or Titan which is fine next up we have
the bigger older brother to our previous
legendary SFX power supply this
Silverstone 450 watt SFX 80 plus gold
fine up till 270 X which it did manage
to boot with and was able to get a max
overclock from the 270 X but I was
unable to get anything stable from the
CPU other than just stock just for fun
we have tastic 450 watt power supply
from my scrapyard Wars machine with the
HD 7770 we were able to max out the GPU
and overclock the CPU to 3.1 gigahertz
without any crashes
this resulted in a pull of 295 Watts
from the wall also something to note is
that this power supply started to stink
quite badly when we pushed it concerning
at the least but as the band suicide
silence or even Drake would like to say
Yolo I was able to max out the r7 265
and yet again was only able to get the
CPU to 3.1 gigahertz which total the
total of 320 watts from the wall this is
where things went downhill for the poor
little power supply however it refused
to boot with the 270x installed and
actually never booted again on any setup
including ones that I had previously
tested verified working after that our
IP you crappy little power supply our IP
jumping up 100 watts we had to be quiet
550 watt 80 plus gold power supply this
guy was able to max out everything until
the Titan X setups which it was able to
do quite well actually it was able to
support a maximum clock on the Titan X
but only 3.1 gigahertz on the CPU while
pulling a total of five hundred and
sixty watts from the wall another 100
watts more brings us to the 650 watt
cooler master some power supply this guy
was totally happy to run everything
maxed out and up to and including a
single GTX Titan X which it did while
pulling 580 watts from the wall it was
able to boot a stock GPU settings dual
Titan X setup and it was
I'm fine until we put it under load
where it unfortunately but expectedly
crashed after a minute or two while
pulling 680 watts from the wall for a
few minutes the corsair ax 850 watt
power supply is up next with an
additional 200 watts of power this power
supply is able to crank every setup to
the max but just barely throttle back on
the max settings for dual Titan setup
resulting in a pretty solid clock but
not as high as I might have hoped at a
little any bit C step up we have the
antique high current gamer 900 watt
power supply which was able to run
everything at full without much trouble
but hit 875 Watts from the wall while
running dual Titan X is fully
overclocked and while running the 59 60
X fully overclocked as well cutting it a
little close on that one but being okay
overall last but not least we have our
ludicrous level power supply the 1200
watt corsair ax 1200 i 80-plus platinum
which as you probably guessed it ran
everything totally fine and as
everything was already maxed out it
didn't have any overclocking benefits to
give now that was a lot of testing and
in conclusion we have I think a fairly
expected answer more wattage will help
you get a higher overclock if your
system is throttling or crashing due to
a lack of wattage but a massive
overabundance of wattage won't actually
have an effect on what potential clock
speeds you're able to obtain if you're
already hitting your maximum overclocks
anyways is this many more to this
discussion of what power supplied by
definitely efficiency is a big one and
while this video was interesting running
your power supply at Full Tilt all the
time is probably not the best idea ever
but that will have to wait for another
time speaking of settings I'm excited to
announce a very special drop on mass
drop today they're featuring the vortex
Poker 3 a keyboard that I think is
absolutely gorgeous it still has the
Cherry MX switches and pbt key caps that
we saw on the previous poker - but
vortex has steps their game up pretty
significantly on the poco 3 by utilizing
a much higher quality metal case and
including more programming capabilities
than we saw on the poker - the drop is
already unlocked its lowest
price possible on mass drop because of
how ridiculously awesome it is in my
opinion and is currently available for
one hundred and five US dollars a pretty
significant discount off of the MSRP the
drop will be live at the drop dot link
in the video description for about
eleven more days but if you want to pick
up one for free we're actually hosting a
giveaway on the forum for this unit that
we have in the office right here for the
next seven days for details they'll be
available in the link in the description
which is the Linus tech tips link are
there any other thought experiment
