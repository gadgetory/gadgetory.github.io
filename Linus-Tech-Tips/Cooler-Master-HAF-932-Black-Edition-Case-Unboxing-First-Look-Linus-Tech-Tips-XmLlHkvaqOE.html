unboxing of the half nine three two but
this is actually a special half nine
three two you can't tell from that side
of the box but on this side you can see
that this is the half nine three two
Black Edition so the half nine three two
is already a very well regarded
well-established gaming case in its own
right but the Black Edition adds a few
features so you've got better or
improved GPU cooling okay you have a
transparent side window remember the
half 932 has kind of a smoke style side
window you've also got support for two
SSDs and it comes with two 230
millimeter fans so let's go ahead get
this box open and I'm just going to show
you guys the packing materials that I'm
going to unbox it and then I'm gonna
kind of come back so we've got your
standard kind of this is a semi soft
kind of foam so it's not super brittle
but it's also not a closed cell foam
that you see on some cases so let me
just dump it out and I'll be back in a
sec since the half 9-3 to Black Edition
isn't actually that different from the
regular half this is going to be more of
a look at the half 932 and with a
special highlight on the features that
are different about the Black Edition so
we've got the large clear window here so
that is one of the key differences other
than that the case looks pretty much the
same from the outside so we'll start on
this side okay you've got side vents
here you've got that half branding on
the on the side of the case here you've
got on the top actually on the top is
interesting because you've got support
for a 230 millimeter fan or you have
support for dual 120 millimeter fans so
that gives you the ability to add a
liquid cooling radiator for example or
to use two smaller fans if you want to
use your own because it's hard to find
aftermarket 230 mm fans here you've got
a spot for a fill port which is awesome
I mean
everyone should include room for a fill
part in their case because it cost
nothing all you do is drill a hole and
then the water-cooling guys are pretty
happy and then you've also got a little
rubberized thing here for putting you
know screws up that's right
screws or lens caps it caps so they
won't move and he won't get lost
you have a reset switch power switch on
the front of the case we've got front
USB to four ports we have firewire eSATA
as well as a microphone and headphone
jack we've got our power light as well
as our hard drive LED so the five and a
quarter inch bays are removed quite
easily from this particular case you
just press in the things from the side
they pop out you're going to have to
punch these out in order to install the
drives but that's no big deal so one six
five and a quarter inch bays so let me
just go ahead throw that back in there
there we are and then let's see if
there's any trick to the front can't
remember for the life of me how this
works
mm-hmm okay on the other side not really
much of note vents here but that's about
it
actually I'm going to need a screwdriver
to second at the back we see one of the
features that's great about the half
9:32 that is the option to either
install your power supply in the top or
in the bottom so you can do whichever
you prefer all you have to do is take
out a plate here and then you have can
move it down to the other spot install
your power supply wherever you please
we've also got a 140 millimeter / 120
millimeter fan mount so you can mount
either kind of fan you desire and seven
PCI expansion slots which is standard so
the 1/2 X actually has more and is
compatible with XL ATX motherboards
whereas the 1/2 932 is intended for your
standard ATX motherboards all right so
why don't we start from front or rather
from the side ok so the first thing we
see here is a GPU duct
alright that's fairly obvious it does
come out if you don't want to use it so
there's a couple thumb screws holding it
in but it's there so I guess you might
as well you might as well make use of it
it looks like
you can probably put a fan in there yep
it's got mounting holes for a 120
millimeter fan so that's going to give
you airflow directly over your graphics
cards to make sure that they do not
overheat in any way I mean you've also
got a 230 millimeter fan here at the
front of the case but what this does is
it just it provides a push-pull scenario
so where if you have a ton of drives
here and it's a restricted space you're
going to be able to force more air
through the front of the case directly
over the GPU by setting up both of those
fans so speaking of drives we have
support for five three and a half inch
drives we have one SSD rail here and
then supposedly support for another SSD
somewhere but I'll have to figure out
where that is a little bit later on in
the process here because I don't see it
yet interesting okay down here we've got
our power supply mount we've got support
for up to oh this is cool so we've got
support for up to to 120 millimeter fans
down here in the bottom of the case so
that is if you don't put your power
supply here you can have that as an
intake on the case we have two lists oh
yeah I should show you guys this tool is
mounting for all of our for all of our
drives so it doesn't look very solid but
as soon as you put a drive in it it
actually solids right up and holds the
drive very securely it's actually one of
the more one of the more impressive tool
list drive holders that I have seen in
my I guess I can say it years of
unboxing products so there you go
tool is five and a quarter inches so
these are just the push button sort all
right up here we've got all of those
internal cables so you got your eSATA
your front power your front switches
your front USB audio firewire everything
is all right there so here are some
accessories I'm guessing we're going to
find another three and a half inch to
two and a half inch adapter inside here
for the other SSD
and we don't okay here is an 8-pin power
adapter this is a very very thoughtful
inclusion from Coolermaster because not
all power supplies reach all the way
from the bottom up to the eight pin on
the top of your motherboard so they've
included this just in case your power
supply manufacturers made one with short
cables here isn't a 5-bit of quarter
inch two three and a half inch adapter
so if you want to turn one of those
front five and a quarter inch Bay's into
a card reader or floppy drive you just
still need a floppy drive then you can
go ahead and do that here we have all
the screws and zip ties you're going to
need to build your system as well as
wheels so this is a steel case it's a
happy case especially once you load it
up with hardwire hardware so it does
come we have casters so that you don't
have trouble moving it around all right
other features let's see yeah we're
getting pretty close so here's our other
230 millimeter fan this is not an LED
one the one in the front however is we
do have a CPU cutout so what that means
is that you can swap your CPU cooler
even without taking out the motherboard
even if it uses a backplate you've got
your standard spot for your IO here and
you know what I'm going to do I'm
actually going to take a break I'm going
to find out where that other SSD mount
is and I'll let you guys know found it
it's in one of the five and a quarter
inch bays right here so you've got one
at three and a half to 2.5 inch
you've got one five and a quarter inch
to 2.5 inch so you can mount up to two
SSDs natively in the case and then for
our drives and one two three four five
five five and a quarter inch devices all
the same time so thank you for checking
