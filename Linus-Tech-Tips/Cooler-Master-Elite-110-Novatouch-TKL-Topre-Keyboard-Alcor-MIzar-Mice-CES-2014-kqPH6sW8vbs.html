brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital we're kicking things off
here in the cooler master suite with the
elite 110 so if you've seen their Elite
Series cases before then you'll probably
have some idea what to expect except
this one takes the concept of a super
super small no compromises gaming rig
and makes it well super small and really
not that many compromises so let's have
a look at what we got in here you can
see there's the obvious stuff so it
takes a mini ITX motherboard so it's
usually 2 DIMM slots and then you're
gonna have a maximum of one graphics
card in a single PCI Express 16x slot a
they've added a full-size ATX power
supply so you can actually put even
quite a long power supply in here and
you'll have a fair bit of space as long
as you don't also have a liquid cooling
radiator so they've gone with a V 550
which is more of a normal-sized power
supply and then they've actually got
room for a single 120 millimeter liquid
cooling radiator for the CPU down below
there's also a little bit of space in
between them for cable management
although you wouldn't want to make
things too dense in there in order to
avoid restricting your airflow to the
point where it's detrimental to the
system in terms of Drive mounting
options around on the other side we find
either two two and a half inch drive
mounts or a single three and a half inch
drive mount then there's actually a cage
for the top that can support up to an
additional two two and a half inch SSDs
now we can see the graphics card in
there so this is going to be optimized
for your sort of your mini ITX designed
graphics card so MSI for example has an
upcoming gtx 760 that is about the same
length as a mini ITX motherboard which
would be a great option for this so are
you building you know a dual Titan rig
and something that's the size of a
couple of shoeboxes no but are you
putting a very reasonable gaming system
in here the answer is yes next up we've
got the Nova touch tkl and the way that
they are branding this is japanese-made
a hybrid electrostatic capacitive
switches however anyone worth their salt
when it comes to keyboard knowledge is
going to take a key cap off this bad boy
and go oh these are tourists so for
those of you who have been begging cool
master to bring a Tofurky board to
market your answers or your answers have
now been prayer yes that is the opposite
your prayers have now been answered
they have just this model coming for now
although I wouldn't be surprised to see
something like a full length with a
number-pad and you know who knows what
other kinds of options we might see in
the future but one really key thing
about this that stands out to me is the
fact that they are customizing the
tofurkey switches to make them
compatible with Cherokee caps so if
you're really into the whole key cap
modding scene you've got a particular
set of key caps that you like and you
want to move it onto your new keyboard
you want to get Topher's this is going
to be a fantastic option for you next up
and to round things out we have the AL
core and the Mizar so our Mays Mizar
maser Mizar anyway the point is these
are two mice that have a very iconic
shape to them and we're gonna get some
great footage of these and I would love
for you guys to guess under the video
what Mouse you think the ergonomics of
these mice most closely resembles
because that might get you pretty
excited about the shape of them there
are two different options of pretty much
a similar product so they both have
rubber rubbery grippy sort of sides
they're both optimized for palm or claw
or depending on how you want to hold it
whatever you want kind of a hybrid grip
and they the main difference between
them is they have two different sensors
so they both got RGB lighting you can
change them to whatever you want but the
Alcor has a 4000 dpi Avago 3090 sensor
so that's the one that's pretty well
regarded for not having any acceleration
issues or anything like that and then
for the lead hacks or gamers actually
this one has better rubberized grips
than the out course or excuse me
these are these are quite soft and
grippy and this one also gets an 8200
dpi laser sensor so that gives you a
little bit more compatibility with
different surfaces but of course whether
people prefer optical or laser is
something that it is a hotly debated and
definitely not something that is within
the scope of this video guys don't miss
any of our CES 2014 coverage remember
our trip to the show is sponsored by NCI
XCOM your source for great technology
selection and service and of course our
other sponsors our Corsair memory and
Western Digital huge thanks to those
guys as well because without all of the
there's no way we'd be able to be here
bringing you guys this content</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
