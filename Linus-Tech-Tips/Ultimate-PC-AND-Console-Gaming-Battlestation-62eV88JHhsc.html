Internet's most epic battle stations
intel reached out with a sponsorship and
challenge build a new DIY desk project
even better than before highlighting the
8th generation Core i7 8700 K in a be a
gaming rig so we set out this time with
a small form factor origin Kronos the
plan a gaming setup that lets you have
it any way you like switching between PC
gaming and console gaming with ease and
with a throwback to that analog feel
with physical buttons oh and RGB
naturally
thinking it would be easier to augment
an existing desk rather than build one
from scratch
we used ideas build your own desk tool
as a starting point and chose a mixture
of wood finish and pure white for a
modern look that would also effectively
bounce our RGB lighting around before we
dive into the DIY action let's meet the
gaming PC that Intel provided for this
project origin pcs Chronos complete with
custom paint job it rocks the up to 4.7
gigahertz Intel Core i7 8700 K and all
six cores of it are tamed by origins own
frostbite 120 liquid cooler which allows
it to really stretch its legs despite
the system small size so we modified the
cabinet portion of the desk so that it
could hold not only our Kronos but also
an Xbox one X and a ps4 pro oh yeah and
all of the circuitry needed to switch
between them so we picked up these LED
toggle buttons on Amazon this HDMI
switch for changing our inputs and an
Arduino Uno to act as the brain for the
whole thing to make room for all these
goodies we decided to remove the
cabinet's top three drawers and then to
shift the rails down on one of the two
large bottom drawers so we could swap it
out for a small one then using some
white wood paneling that we got from
Home Depot we made three custom shelves
that we fastened to the cabinet walls by
simply drilling new holes and inserting
those small wooden dowels that are often
included with IKEA furniture
protip by the way you can take as many
of those as you need from the bins that
IKEA customer service ultimately we
didn't end up with a ton of extra space
around each system which isn't great for
thermals so if you're following along at
home then you might choose to keep just
one drawer at the bottom instead of two
or you can do what we did and integrate
some cooling fans at the back this
allowed us to keep the storage space at
the bottom and the more finished look of
the tight compartments but hold on a
second if there's so little space above
the Cronos where all the switches in
wiring gonna go huh oh ye of little
faith
there's a spare three and a half
centimeters up there
now this is not quite enough for a
fourth shelf given that the shelves
themselves are almost 2 centimeters
thick but what if we salvaged some of
our discarded cabinet pieces to make a
custom super low-profile drawer
we remounted our spare rails and gorilla
glue on a new facade that would hold our
switches a wallah all the desks hardware
in a compartment no taller than the trim
piece that we were going to use anyway
so it's going great so far but let's be
honest this wouldn't be an LTT project
without at least a dash of jury-rigged
Jiang curry - let me assure you this is
an LTT project to seamlessly switch from
PC to Xbox to PlayStation we needed each
of our physical buttons to correspond to
an input on our HDMI switch one each for
HDMI one HDMI 2 and HDMI 3 problem is we
could not find an HDMI switch that had
individual physical buttons for each
input instead they all have one button
that cycles through the inputs however
they do come with remotes and the
remotes have individual buttons so our
plan then was to connect our Arduino to
the remote and then just point the
remote point blank and our HDMI switch
inside the cabinet problem solved or at
least it would have been if we hadn't
accidentally connected a 5 volt power
supply to a 3 volt remote and completely
destroyed it in the end we soldered the
HDMI switch directly to the Arduino and
relied on software to send the
appropriate number of button presses
depending on which input you're starting
on anyway after all that it was just a
matter of using a hole saw tube or cable
management hole so we could you know
plug stuff in because that's important
and so we could wire up our RGB strips
which we opted to stick to the top side
of each compartment way at the back for
a sexy gentle glow then we added wood
trim with a bit of overhang to hide the
RGB strips wrote this Arduino script
control the switches and the lights and
put the whole thing including an
ultra-wide monitor together ending the
console wars and ushering in a new era
of gaming a peaceful era of gaming once
and for all
not bad for a total of four hundred and
twenty dollars
so thanks santel for sponsoring this
build and thanks to you guys for
watching if you disliked it you can hit
that button but if you liked it hit like
get subscribes maybe consider checking
out where to buy the stuff we featured
at the links in the video description
also down there we're gonna have our
merch dorm chests cool shirts like this
one and our community forum which you
