company is send us stuff or I buy it and
then I tell you what I think is good
with the purchase of a qualifying Intel
processor SSD or nook you could
instantly win and Intel gaming Jersey
and be entered in the draw for the
ultimate system click now to learn more
so let's get this kicked off with
something I've been meaning to buy ever
looking back at older videos you can see
me taking the temperature of a notebook
with a K type probe taped down to some
thermal goop to ensure I'm getting a
reasonably accurate reading this method
worked but is more time-consuming and
certainly messier than I'd like welcome
to the new age I don't know that this
particular model is super amazing or
anything but it's very well reviewed on
Amazon and for a mere 44 dollars I can
now take the temperature of pretty much
anything I can aim it at it records
temperatures from minus 60 to 500
degrees Celsius has a laser guide so you
know where you're pointing uses triple-a
batteries instead of the for me less
common 9-volt batteries and has a
distance to spot ratio of twelve to one
meaning the patch it's measuring is 1/12
the size of the distance you're holding
the unit away from a given surface it's
got some limitations though it won't
take air temperature solids and liquids
only it doesn't have adjustable
emissivity so it can read higher or
lower depending on the reflective
consistency of the surface and it
doesn't come with any kind of certified
calibration or anything like that but
there are tons of things that could be
useful for including anything you don't
want to damage or contaminate by
touching it anywhere that's difficult or
dangerous to reach or even taking the
temperature of moving objects with the
one-second delay between the trigger
press and readout what I use it for is
quick and dirty temperature readings on
products with notebooks it allows me to
find hot spots very quickly and for
things like graphics cars it lets us
take a look at sorry we're back and for
things like graphics cards it lets us
take a look at at least the surface
temperature of components that aren't
normally read by software great for
diagnosing problems next up we've got a
product that has generated a ton of
confusion over the
because apparently lots of people didn't
know that you can simply buy a dongle
for 12 bucks and connect up to four
wireless Xbox 360 controllers to your PC
for single or multiplayer use I always
get people being like what controller is
that or like oMG Linus is gaming on Xbox
but a picture or video shows up with a
wireless Xbox controller in it nope not
the case you just plug this bad boy in
install the driver from the disk or
download one and force the install then
bind it to the controller and the same
way that presumably you do it on a
console I've actually never done it on a
console but if you need instructions you
can find them on the official Microsoft
product page because every game today is
basically a console port I find using an
Xbox controller is a super easy way to
make sure that all the buttons are bound
correctly out of the box and I've been
doing this for years it's awesome and
well worth the twelve dollars especially
if you already have a controller or two
lying around the last product for today
is one that I only bought because I felt
like I was forced to LG managed to make
one of the finest monitors on the market
the 34 um 95 ultra wide 34 40 by 1440 21
by I aspect ratio monitor that I
reviewed here with one of the worst
monitor stands that I've ever seen it
only has two height settings and even
worse at the highest fixed setting it's
still not high enough for me so the
Satechi f1 smart monitor stand looked
like a good bet to get the monitor up a
little higher and add front audio
extensions and a USB to hop to my desk
at the same time from the pictures it
looked to be well built attractive in a
minimalist sort of way and practical
because it allows you to use the space
under it for storage instead of just
wasting it in practice the platform is
solid enough for me
although the 22 pound weight rating
doesn't seem deserved given the
complaints from 27 inch iMac users and
while it does allow you to store stuff
under it I just don't find it that nice
looking the picture made it look like it
would kind of match an aluminum finish
on the top but when it arrived I found
that aside from the attractive aluminum
legs the finish is very cheap and
plasticky feeling it can be assembled
two different ways to either elevate
your display 8 or 10 and 1/2 centimeters
by either folding
out or not folding out the two plastic
tabs but this mechanism while once again
solid enough for my use just didn't
inspire that much confidence my last
complaint is that the built-in 4 port
USB hub isn't powered not even a power
jack to give me the option to buy a 5
volt adapter and use one myself that
would have gone a long way towards
making me feel a little better about the
purchase maybe I'm asking too much of
this one though it was only 35 bucks and
still planning to use it because of that
price I consider it very fair if I
wasn't gonna use it I wouldn't have
featured it in the video but next time I
might use a little bit more of my less
than $100 budget for a Mont understand
that we're gonna showcase on the channel
here maybe something a little bit nicer
speaking of showcase that's the channel
at least here in Canada anyway where as
a kid I was able to find all the soft
port or sorry what was I talking about
oh right ah Hulu Plus ah it offers
simple and reliable video streaming
service for your PC smartphone TV or
tablet with a wide range of network TV
shows Criterion movies kids shows an
anime Hulu Plus has the quantity and
variety to suit a wide range of viewing
needs personally I'd be pretty stoked
then starting September Hulu Plus will
feature the entire archive of previous
South Park episodes as well as new ones
yay now I've had a number of our viewers
point out to me that Hulu Plus like
regular Hulu costs $7.99 a month and
still has ads yes we know the point of
the plus part is that you get more
archived content and the ability to view
it across a wider variety of devices
maybe that's not compelling enough for
you or maybe it is why not give it a
shot visit Hulu Plus calm slash Linus
and get a two week trial of the service
so you can decide for yourself time for
the full disclosure part of this video
which I think you guys need to know
since handy techies kind of straight up
recommendations rather than reviews for
this episode it's easy
I bought the thermometer and the monitor
stand for work and the generic Xbox
dongle to replace my broken official
Microsoft one anyway thanks for watching
guys like if you liked just like if you
just like leave a comment with other
suggestions for future hand detect under
