socket had bells and whistles like
quad-channel memory support higher
overall memory capacity more PCI Express
Lanes
so therefore inherently better support
for multi graphics card setups and
finally support for processors with more
than 4 cores so why is it that Core i5
and core i7 is on the main stream socket
have been so popular with gamers
overclockers and enthusiasts with the
purchase of a qualifying Intel processor
SSD or nook you could instantly win and
Intel gaming Jersey and be entered in
the draw for the ultimate system click
now to learn more in the LGA 1366 days
all the hardware nerds went enthusiast
because that's where the hot offerings
like the core i7 920 could be found but
starting with Sandy Bridge back in early
2011 Intel started releasing their newer
processor microarchitectures on the
mainstream platform first before
bringing them to the enthusiast platform
so particularly for gamers it was better
to buy the lower end product for better
single-threaded performance often that
are overclocking much lower prices and
even more up-to-date feature sets
thunderbolt for example has never been
available to DIY consumers on LGA 2011
in fact the only real reason to go
enthusiasts was to get a 6 core
processor but unless you wanted a pretty
slow Xeon those started at $1000 until a
year ago when the 49 30 K became
available at the value price of nearly
$600 still pretty expensive but now they
finally done it with the release of the
LGA 2011 3 socket and x99 chipset and
the 5820k 59 30k and 59 6 DX CPUs to go
with them Intel has finally addressed my
complaints and made the final step
towards reestablishing really the
sensibility of their 2 socket system
we've gone LGA 1150 for mainstream
consumers and LGA 2011 3 for enthusiasts
with all CPUs on both sockets featuring
the latest Haswell microarchitecture
except now in addition to more PCIe gen3
lanes except the 5820k which actually
gets fewer and quad-channel memory we
get support for ddr4 which means higher
speed memory at lower voltages with
lower power consumption and higher
capacities in the future thunderbolt
expansion capability better base clock
overclocking and every LGA 2011 3 CPU
has at least 6 processing cores and 12
threads with hyper-threading with $1,000
Extreme Edition featuring 8 cores and 16
threads but before you get too excited
it's not all peer sunshine and rainbows
on LGA 2011 3 there are no core i5s
so in terms of pricing haswell-e
enthusiast grade chips start where
regular has well and devil's canyon ones
leave off at around $400 on top of that
x99 boards and the ddr4 to go with them
are more expensive as well do the higher
cost of the chipset more complicated
board design and the engineering costs
associated with bringing a new platform
to market and then for the RAM it's just
in such low volumes in terms of
manufacturing that it tends to be very
very expensive every time we transition
memory technologies but you guys can
watch this video to hear all that boring
oh it's expensive stuff so let's show
off the hardware for today's performance
overview of the brand-new high-end 59 60
X first up is the board a sue sent over
there creatively named x99 deluxe the
follow-up to our favorite last gen board
around here the X 79 deluxe and it comes
with some serious upgrades first up is
those ddr4 memory slots that support up
to 64 gigs of DDR 4 and with the right
kit we've confirmed this with the three
gigahertz high-speed g.skill memory kit
that we ran our performance numbers with
up to 3,000 megahertz ddr4 with some
creative XMP implementation that
actually uses the 125 base clock strap
and lowers the CPU multiplier but kept
our system stable throughout benching
somehow in spite of the slightly over
claw CPU speed so there you go next
we've got dramatically improved storage
capabilities the last gen board was
stuck with only two native SATA 3 ports
for with a Marvel controller well now we
get up to 12 with four of them capable
of being used for up to two SATA Express
10 gigabit ports and then on top of all
that we get this fancy little bracket
that allows an MDOT two SSD to be
installed that will run at ten gigabit
per second as well USB three has gotten
a significant upgrade as well with a
total of fourteen ports supported
although I personally wouldn't have
minded seeing a couple of these replaced
by a ps2 port some of us still like them
but since we're checking out the rear
i/o now seems like a good time to
mention the upgraded networking we've
got better Intel networking now with
slightly better performance lower CPU
utilization and more software
prioritizations options we've also got
three spatial stream onboard AC wireless
that boasts 1.3 gigabit per second
maximum theoretical bandwidth and then
finally not related to networking but
also on the back panel we've got
upgraded onboard audio that features
some of the same technology that we've
become accustomed to seeing on our og
boards like amplified headphone output
and audio grade capacitors and whatnot
onto the UEFI BIOS there's been an
aesthetic and functional overhaul we get
all the fancy little features that z97
users have been enjoying like the
configurable favorite submenu simplified
overclocking and raid setup and finally
in BIOS temperature sensor controlled
fan curve configuration that can handle
either DC or PWM control on any fan
header on the board or the little molex
power daughter board that you can
reposition and that acts as a
controllable fan hub elsewhere in your
system giving you up to eight
controllable fans oh yeah and it looks
pretty sweet too I guess with white
shielding on the i/o and a sexy matte
black PCB this is a big improvement over
the last generation gold thing they had
going on onto the cpu today will be
focused on the big kahuna the 59 60 X
this is an 8 core mother of a chip that
comes clocked at really three gigahertz
base that's it I mean sure it's got 20
Meg's at level three cache compared to
50 Meg's on the lower end chips and to
full extra cores but three gigahertz
stock 3.5 gigahertz max turbo am I
supposed to be impressed not until we
start overclocking it something anyone
buying themselves an Extreme Edition
owes it to themselves to do overclocked
we got our chip running at four point
three five gigahertz effortlessly at
which speed we were even able to run our
ddr4 Ram at 3,000 megahertz and we've
seen reports around the web of 3.6
gigahertz even without pushing these
things too hard on liquid cooling so at
that point is it fast well we put it up
against the consumer grade chip that has
passed for high-end up until now the
core i7 4790k to determine exactly
what's up with the CPU when it comes to
gaming performance well until DirectX 12
land with its supposed dramatic
improvements to multi-threading
supporting games I think a course might
be a bit overkill for normal gamers and
higher / core clock speeds will continue
to be important but throwing some of
i-264 synthetic benchmarks at it reveals
a different story and back to the real
world when we start feeding it some
truly multi-threading optimized
workloads such as file compression and
3d rendering the 59 60 X reveals itself
as the true multi-threading Beast that
it is in fact once overclocked it's
really not that far off the two and a
half thousand dollar last gen 12 core
Xeon that we just put in a Diesel's
machine for editing and 3d rendering so
that's it for the extreme edition but
don't worry we're gonna be doing lots
more content around Intel's latest truly
enthusiast grade platform but we want
your feedback on what you want to see
from us should we take a deep dive into
the 5820 KS performance which aside from
12 fewer PCI Express Lanes seems to be
the ultimate gamer and multitasker sweet
spot should we look into this new
platform from a content creator
perspective should we quantify the
real-world difference between ddr3 and
ddr4 and as close to an apples to apples
comparison as we can you let us know
what kind of content we should make
thanks for watching guys and a huge
thanks to g.skill who sponsored today's
episode and provided the brand spanking
new
Ripjaws for ddr4 ram featured in the
video we've been using g.skill ram in
our test benches for a long time now we
trust their products and we're extremely
happy to finally be working with them
from our sponsorship sort of level the
specific kit that we showed off today is
a four by four gig 16 gig kit running at
3,000 megahertz 1.3 5 volts CL 15 but
they'll be offering a very comprehensive
lineup including a 16 get gig kit that
runs at 3200 megahertz
a 32 gig kit at 3,000 megahertz and a 64
gig kit at 2800 megahertz
bananas G skills 16 gig 32 hundred
megahertz kit actually holds the current
ddr4 speed record at four thousand four
megahertz pretty darn fast for such a
new platform anyway guys if you need
some ddr4 consider using the link in the
video description to pick it up thanks
for watching again don't forget to like
