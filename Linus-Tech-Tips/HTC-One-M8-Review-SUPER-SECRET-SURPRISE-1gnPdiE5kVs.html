finally the update to the phone that's
been my daily driver whenever I'm not
working on reviewing something else for
the last year it is time to replace my
HTC one with this other more different
HTC One and if that seems confusing
you're not the only one
HTC zone website actually even resorts
to using the codename m8 to clarify what
product it is you're looking at now as
far as specs go there's not much for me
to say in a video it's got a Snapdragon
801 chip clocked at 2.3 gigahertz in
most markets it's got 2 gigs of ram and
realistically if you want to know more
there's an amazing site called GSM arena
comm where you can enjoy a wall of text
just like this one for any phone you can
imagine so without further ado let's get
on with the stuff that watching a video
legitimately helps with kicking off our
physical tour I've got the gunmetal
version which features what feels like a
perfectly smooth back but it actually
has a brushed looking finish to it but
the phone is also available in silver
and pirate the gorgeous backing wraps up
to the screen which it nearly perfectly
joins with a tasteful beveled edge and
the overall fit and finish of the phone
is immaculate with almost no discernible
imperfections even where metal meets
glass at the top and the bottom of the
screen a somewhat common issue on the
last generation product the increase in
metal content for the chassis from 70%
to 90% features prominently in HTC's
marketing and while some reviewers
preferred the flat composite edges of
the m7 for grip I actually like the
seamless rounded edges it reminds me of
Samsung's whole made Ferb Humans thing
that they did with the s3 except that
HTC does it with a level of build
quality that Samsung for whatever reason
just refuses to acknowledge is important
bottom line this phone feels great and
even more solid in my hands than the m7
a phone that survives quite a few
significant drops without damage for me
the one gripe that I had initially was
the extra weight
but given the larger 5-inch screen size
and even more premium feel it has I can
forgive this and in fact I'm beginning
to appreciate the sheer this is a
serious piece of hardware massive the m8
it reminds me of the feeling I get when
holding an iPhone 4 which it remarkably
only weighs about 8 percent more than in
spite of the larger screen it really
does set this phone apart the 5-inch
display is covered in Gorilla Glass 3
and features some of the most subtle
sexy haptic feedback I've ever felt
and while objective testing on the
interwebs would indicate that in fact
the black levels are not as deep as the
m7 and the color accuracy is perhaps not
as good as the Moto X or even the one
max I subjectively found both of those
four mentioned phones very warm looking
to the eye and the m8 much more pleasing
so your mileage may vary one thing that
really blew me away though was the lack
of color shift or image quality
degradation when viewing off axis kudos
HTC and I also really like the small
tweak to their auto brightness since I
last used it 40 percent is enough for me
even outside and now I can set a maximum
for auto brightness so I use it all the
time and it works great above the screen
is a five megapixel camera that records
1080p video and here's an audio sample
from it more than enough for video
chatting under the screen the dedicated
multitasking button built in to sense 6
instead of requiring a DoubleTap of home
is very welcome but using that extra
point three inches of screen real estate
that we gained from the m7 on on-screen
buttons in general is a bit of a mixed
bag for me Google is putting pressure on
handset makers to move towards them but
between the HTC logo chin bar that HTC
says they needed for internal components
and the on-screen buttons in landscape
mode the keyboard is shifted so much to
the left that I find myself miss typing
a lot more than usual that combined with
the way that the on-screen buttons
disappear sometimes and you need two
button presses to do stuff and but I
mean I like that they're contextual and
stuff so atom on the top of the phone we
find an IR emitter a feature that I
actually didn't use once with the m7 but
one that's nice to have if you watch TV
I guess
and the power button or lock button
which is actually as shallow as this
might sound my second biggest gripe with
this phone you don't need to use it to
turn the phone on
thanks to HTC's gesture based motion
launch controls that let you double tap
to wake and swipe for home screen voice
dialing blinkfeed or whatever was the
last thing you were doing but I still
use it to turn the screen off and I just
can't find a comfortable way to do that
without mashing the volume buttons on
the side on the left side we've got an
unnecessarily large nano SIM slot and
then on the other that somewhat too easy
to press volume rocker than I mentioned
before and Great Scott what's this
HTC yields to Google home screen buttons
and powered by Android startup screen
branding but not to the elimination of
the microSD slot great inclusion here
buy it a dollar for every time someone
bought a galaxy s4 instead of a one m7
because of the no microSD slot I would
have more money than HTC does right now
the headphone jack is now on the bottom
next to microUSB a position I used to
prefer since it tugs less while holding
the device but I use my phone with my
right hand and stored in my left pocket
so I actually find this a little bit
more ergonomic than this when I'm
putting it away so now I prefer the top
headphone jack but it's a very very
minor complaint since we're on the
subject of the headphone jack I
complained about the amp on the m7 early
on but later discovered that the
problems were caused by the subpar HTC
music player app included with the m7
since switching to Apollo on the m7 I no
longer have any complaints about it and
the m8 is also just dandy in terms of
headphone audio output quality speaking
of dandy the speaker's sure they're not
standalone Bluetooth speakers but
they're loud enough and sound good
enough for me to legitimately enjoy
YouTube videos in a noisy environment
like a moving car and listen to music at
my desk while I work a freaking Plus as
a Content consumer I will trade the
extra phone height that is consumed by
resonance chambers for this sound
experience every day and HTC is just
making the other guys look stupid at
this point
I mean these days whenever I get my
hands on a device with bottom or rear
mounted speakers I can't even bring
myself to make the joke about the
cupping your hand trick anymore it's
just not funny anymore it's a miracle
the other guys have let htc stay more
than a year ahead of them now with an
innovative feature like pointing a sound
source at the listeners ears but since
I'm an HTC user I guess it doesn't
really matter to me what the others do
and all I can really say is enjoy the
cup trick everyone else yeah yeah turns
out it's still funny when it's someone
else moving around to the back of the
phone we find the ultrapixel four
megapixel camera is back with some
capabilities added and others taken away
it lacks optical image stabilization
this time but is now accompanied by a
two-tone flash for better flesh tones
and it has more processing horsepower
behind it a major contributing factor to
the wicked fast shutter speed of this
bad boy
seriously whip your phone out
horizontally press the volume button the
camera app is ready to capture the
moment you can rapid-fire it when your
kid has your finger up his nose or
whatever it is that you're trying to get
on camera you can use Zoe's HTC's video
/ photo at the same time thing that
works really well with highlight reels a
little software feature that cuts
together photos and videos with music
and effects and now allows more granular
clip selection and your own music to be
added but I found machine-gunning the
shutter or capturing stills during
regular video recording was just as
effective but all of that is still
pretty normal stuff what about HTC's
other camera on the back that one is
used to gather depth information and in
theory it allows images to be refocused
in post or effects to be added to the
background and also this funky parallax
effect but in practice I use this about
as often as the feature that lets me
cover a photo with cherry blossoms or
put scumbag Steve hats on everyone all
in all as someone who never prints my
phone pictures I was already satisfied
with the m7s camera for my Instagram
needs and recording videos of my cats
and I'm satisfied with this one - it's
good enough for me and even though the
m8 does not support 4k recording like
some other
phones are starting to I actually got
quite a few compliments on a video I
uploaded of my cat it looked pretty darn
fantastic so there you go
moving on to software I'm not going to
say too much about sense 6 because I
already liked sense 5.5 and since 6 is
pretty much more of the same the
keyboard prediction sucks the big one
and I find the information density in
blinkfeed just a little bit too low to
be useful for me but SwiftKey for the
win and blinkfeed can be completely
ignored quite easily so those are really
minor complaints and there's so many
other good things I mean even though I'm
not detail-oriented enough to notice
exact changes like the notification bar
changing color depending on the screen
you're looking at I do generally
appreciate the improvements HTC
continues to make to their overall
aesthetic and the classy new stock sound
scheme and I love their organization
friendly app tray they're multitasking
the easy way that quick settings can be
reconfigured and so much more since is
the Android skin that I started on and I
actually like it better than stock
Android Sumi it's super easy to use and
low overhead enough that it feels just
as snappy as stock Android and I mean
obviously but wicked hardware on this
phone isn't hurting that either this
phone is a blast to use so conclusion
time there was a time when being the
most beautifully crafted Android phone
on the market was about like winning the
chimp Olympics but with the m7 HTC took
Android phone design and build quality
to the next level and the m8 picks up
where it left off there are some issues
that persist the battery is still not
replaceable and iFixit gave the phone a
whopping 2 out of 10 for repair ability
in their teardown video but the good
news about the battery at least is that
even though they only increased capacity
to an unexceptional 2600 milliamp hours
the real-world battery life is a lot
better at the end of the weekday that
means conference calls with the
speakerphone and constant emails and
texting I regularly have 40% left at
night and on weekends I can go the whole
two days before recharging and I'm not
I'm not cheating I've got bluetooth on
and paired to my pebble Wi-Fi mobile
data
accurate GPS location and the onboard
popcorn maker are all enabled at all
times and I am still getting these
results the last phones that I tested
that were like this for me were the
Xperia Z with a bunch of power
management stuff on and the one max
which just had a massive battery
speaking of massive battery another
improvement is the noticeably faster
battery charging on the m8 with my old
iPhone I could pop it on the charger for
30 minutes while I you know get ready to
leave the house and have that actually
last me long enough to get back home and
charge it for real not the case with the
m7 but the m8 is much closer to that
experience and it's a really tangible
improvement no phone is perfect though
and I'm going to wrap up this video with
a couple of complaints number one is
that anon tech discovered HTC is still
enabling higher power states when the
phone detects a benchmark is being run
and number two is actually my biggest
complaint about the phone and that is
that for some reason we're in the 21st
century yeah I mean this guy figured out
this crap a long time ago and this phone
still doesn't have wireless charging
words cannot express how much I wish
that it did but oh sorry hold on I've
got to take this call see that
gesture-based phone call answering oh
