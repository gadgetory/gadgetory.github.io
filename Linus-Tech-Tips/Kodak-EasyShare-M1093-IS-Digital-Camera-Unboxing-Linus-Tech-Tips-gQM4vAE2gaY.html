continue the search for a camera that
will allow us to take good quality
indoor video get some good close-up so
we can actually see what it says on the
boxes of whatever it is we're unboxing
so one of my co-workers mentioned to me
that this kodak easyshare m109 3 is is
actually supposed to be have a pretty
good video movie said it doesn't say
anything about it on the box but it
actually supports 720p video capture so
another thing you'll notice about the
box itself is the is so what that means
is this actually got image stabilization
which is an extremely useful feature as
you may have noticed in one of the
videos we did before where I didn't use
this camera okay so let's have a look at
what we've got inside here so first of
all are you ready to get the most from
your new kodak camera register now get
great deals tips and more plus an
exclusive offer on accessories excellent
okay so inside there what we have is the
users guide which is actually quite
thick for just a consumer camera i'm
assuming it's multiple languages here so
yeah the english part is actually only
about yeah 30 pages long so that's going
to tell you all the basics like how to
turn on the camera how to set the
language date and time etc etc okay next
we have the software disc so this is
available in about 50 different
languages it's version 7 and it works on
Windows or the Mac awesome and last but
not least get ready to get them okay to
talk about that okay so inside you will
find a battery charger so let's just
take this out so you can have a quick
look at it here so it's one of those
ones that plugs into your wall via this
wire if I could find it I would tell you
oh this is okay hold on let's let's sort
out my brain here and then we'll go from
there Oh interesting okay so it plugs in
like this actually there we plug in like
that plug it into the no no that doesn't
work either it does it plugs it in this
way there plugs in like that and then
it's a USB adapter that's all it is
the camera seems to actually charge by
USB not from the wall so that's kind of
handy so it means it probably ninety
percent of the time you're not even
going to bother using this adapter
because you can just charge the camera
with the included USB cable by plugging
that into your computer so yeah what you
would normally do is you plug in the USB
cable here and then you can charge it
with the little mini USB cable here so
then this is a non standard USB so it's
not the normal one that you use for
cameras so be aware of that you can't
just replace it with any USB a to mini-b
connector here we have a little dock
thing okay so that's where the cameras
it's when you're putting it on that then
we've got a little wrist strap then we
have the battery so this is a digital
camera battery it's a rechargeable
lithium-ion battery fairly standard fare
okay and last but not least we have the
camera itself it's quite heavy actually
it's the first thing I notice about it
see if I can get it out of the box here
and show you more closely how it is
heavy although that'll be difficult to
show on film okay so first of all you
can see we've got HD Stills and video
that's one of the things they advertise
about it it's a 10 megapixel camera you
can see it's got a built-in flash here
in a standard 3x optical zoom on this
side you're going to find the USB
connector so please note again that is a
little bit smaller than the standard
mini be connectors then here is a power
in if you were to run it on like a
tripod or whatever for constant video
footage then on the bottom you've got
your SD slot as well as your battery
slot so the battery will go in a little
something like that there we go then
you've got a little tripod amount and
then on the back you've got a nice large
screen which is really nice to see it's
a glossy screen and then here's all of
your control so there's you zoom delete
photo playback all that good stuff and
then on the top you can change the mode
you've got your shutter button flash and
power button so it's a fairly
straightforward little point and shoot
anyway I'm going to do my next video
using this
so we're going to see how good the video
mode is thanks for checking out my blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
