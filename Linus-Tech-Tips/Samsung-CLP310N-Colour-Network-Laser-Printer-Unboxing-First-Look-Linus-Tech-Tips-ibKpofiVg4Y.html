had to buy I've needed a printer for a
while I don't live at home anymore so I
can't use my parents printer and I can
only print out so much stuff at work
before I get in trouble so I needed just
like a value printer I don't believe in
inkjet to be honest unless you must
print out photos at home I can't think
of a good reason to buy an inkjet
printer the nozzles dry up if you don't
use them and you know a couple months
and then you go and replace them I mean
you can refill them but that's a pain so
I got myself a cheap color laser printer
this color laser printer is under $200
it's the Samsung CLP 310 and it is
network ready so that means that you
don't actually have to plug it directly
into a computer you can just plug it
into your into your switch or your
router okay I actually don't know much
about it beyond the fact that it is a
cheap color laser printer so what I can
probably do once I get it set up is
share with you the results in terms of
printing I mean I guess we can look at
the specs although I'm not a printer
expert so it does up to 2400 dpi that's
dots per inch it is ultra compact and it
operates quietly all of these are very
good things for a home use that side is
not an English this side appears to be
an English okay so it's high speed no it
uses high speed USB 2.0 rather it's not
high speed at all it does up to 17 pages
per minute in black 4 pages per minute
in color that's letter size and wow
that's all it really says it ok well
since we're not really going to get any
more information about this printer from
the box why don't we open it up the
reason I like lasers because compared to
ink toner is well similar in price and
compared to ink toner lasts a lot longer
so yeah you're not gonna get this
printer for free with your you know
digital camera that you buy or whatever
you do actually have to pay for a
printer but the usable lifespan of it
will be much much longer because you'll
probably get through years with maybe
one or two toner refill cisu mning you
don't do a ton of printing at home
alright included cables we have we're
just going to sort of do this because
it's easier one power cable
so that's your standard computer power
cable okay that was it and then we have
a little thing in French actually has no
english on it okay so something about
registering your products I can read
French okay then we have a Quick Start
Guide that'll be useful because I will
want to get started quickly and I have a
box open so naturally there are
investigators who would like to see
what's in the box okay stop before
returning this product to the store
please contact support okay you know
what other documentation there is a disc
with the driver on it don't install that
download the latest from the Samsung
website here is a random piece of foam
okay so let's go ahead and flip this
right over and have a look at the
printer itself you know what's a really
I'd like to see on the outside of
printer boxes how many pages per part
Twitter cartridges I think that would be
a good thing to know because I would
actually buy like a different printer I
buy one printer over and other ones
based on more more pages with one
cartridge of toner
so this printer actually uses four
separate argent cartridges it uses one
for black one for yellow one for blue
and one for pink
I think it's magenta cyan and something
else
it fails me like I said I'm more of a
motherboard and RAM and CPU expert than
a printer expert I just kind of press
the button and I hope that something
comes out of it that's the extent of
what I know ah the reason I went with a
Samsung printer
I don't know if I mentioned this already
but this is something that I did have to
buy so many of my unboxings are not
products that I paid my own hard-earned
dollars but this is one of them is
because I do use a samsung black and
white one at work and it gets an m/l
1610 it's been incredibly reliable I've
done a ridiculous amount of printing on
it and I've never actually replaced the
cartridge so any here we find I guess if
you need to unjam something you would
lift this up okay so that's where the
paper comes out presumably
there you have a little flap so the
paper can come out on there in here we
will find all of our toner cartridges so
you can see that the black one is
clearly larger than the colored ones
because they're gonna assume that you do
a lot more black printing than color
printing they have a little
instructional thing on how to replace
your cartridges right here and let's see
if we can figure it out let me click
okay so you pull on it that was easy
okay so there's the black toner
cartridge remember that when you buy a
laser printer or an inkjet printer they
usually come with starter cartridges so
um yeah they're usually not actually
falling well what's this Oh weird so
this has like some yellow gunk in it
I have no idea what that's for so I'm
gonna actually have to read the user
manual if you can tell me what this is
for then please do anyway I'm gonna go
ahead and put my toner cartridge back in
alright let's see if we can find some
other features of this here network
so this appears to be the paper loading
tray there we go
so we load in our a four-letter paper it
looks like it takes a variety of
different sizes depending how you want
to adjust it and then you just go ahead
pulled it over and tuck that in there
easily there we go all right and wow
what is this I don't know okay well
here's more access to the inside of guts
of the printer just in case you need it
here's our interfaces so there's your
power button power input
ten hundred Ethernet like you need
gigabit on a printer and then you've got
a USB B connector for data if you do
want to hook it up directly to your
computer here you have that button
that's basically the something went
wrong but I fixed it button so if you
run out of paper
it'll probably flash some kind of light
you put in more paper press the button
and it should resume printing if it
works like my printer at work does
instead oh here it has on lift handle
because it is quite heavy so if you are
going to lift this printer you should
lift it by the lift handle so I'm gonna
go install it now thank you for watching
my unboxing of the CLP 310 color 310 n
rather color laser printer from Samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
