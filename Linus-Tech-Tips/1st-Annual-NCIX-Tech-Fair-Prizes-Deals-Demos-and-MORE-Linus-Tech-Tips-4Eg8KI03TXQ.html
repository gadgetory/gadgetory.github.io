tech tips today's episode is going to be
about the first annual NCIX tech fair
now I apologize in advance to those
viewers who are not located in Vancouver
or the surrounding area because
unfortunately you won't be able to
attend because this is going to be a
really awesome event we're going to have
over 30 different booths with a wide
variety of vendors including a sous
samsung AMD intel nvidia as well as a
bunch of other guys they're gonna
there's going to be cool demos at all
the different tables and booths the NCIX
pc team is going to be there showing you
how to build your own pc in real time so
every hour they're going to start again
and build another pc so you can come
check that out you can ask questions
every booth is going to be attended by
someone who knows what they're talking
about so if you want to learn about the
latest technology this is going to be a
cool way to do it we're going to have
some pretty sweet gaming rigs ocz is
going to be there with a couple laptops
one with a vertex for SSD one with a
hard drive and they can show you what
will let you use them do whatever you
want in real time to see how much faster
an SSD actually makes your computing
experience so all kinds of neat stuff
like that it's from May twelfth to may
thirteen so it starts at noon on May
twelfth and ends at five pm on May
thirteenth that Saturday and Sunday it's
that the aberdeen center mall in
richmond so parking is a bit of a
challenge but other than that as long as
you go up high enough into the parkade
then you shouldn't have too much
difficulty it just will take you a
little while to to get in there but no
big deal and I think that pretty much
covered oh no there's going to be show
deals there so almost every vendor
that's attending is going to have an
accompanying special deal whether it's a
motherboard or a video card we're going
to have a special deal on a galaxy gtx
670 for example which is hot and new and
very exciting and finally there's going
to be chances to win prizes every hour
