special edition gaming card to go with
Duke Nukem Forever so you can see here
this is the EVGA a limited edition gtx
560 graphics card you can see it has
support for sli 3d vision DirectX 11 and
PhysX you can also see it comes with a
limited edition duke belt buckle you can
hear that that's made of metal that's
like quality right there so that duke
belt buckle is yours to go along with
the rest of your Duke Nukem costume so
as you can see I am in my full Duke
Nukem getup for this unboxing gonna go
ahead and oh I broke it it's okay I'm
gonna go ahead and open up the package
in here find out just exactly what's
going on inside this box okay first
things first let's get the outer
packaging off I'm not going to do
anything inappropriate in this video
just so you guys know there are all
kinds of innuendo type things I could
say about breaking seals or unboxing
things but I'm just not gonna go there
so the outfit was pretty much as
outrageous as I'm gonna get today so
here first thing we find is the nuclear
radiation symbol belt buckle so you can
see here on the back it's got a little
Clippy doodad another thing that goes in
the other thing there you go so that'll
look pretty good to go along with the
rest of your ensemble see oh no I'm like
I'm decked out head-to-toe here check
this out guys I got my boots on got my
like canisters and you know utility belt
don't get too close because they're
actually flight wrappers that I bought
at the dollar store and then I colored
them black without marker so okay next
we have a full coffee full retail copy
of Duke Nukem Forever the game that took
13 years to come out
next we have I have no idea what this is
we next we have a box that baffles even
meat ah here we go the balls of steel
limited edition guide so this is the
wait is over now savor the reward art
from the vaults area maps comprehensive
walk through weapons extensive
multiplayer coverage complete challenge
listing including all 315 challenges
yours with this graphics card finally we
have a limited edition Duke Nukem
Forever mousepad and then we get into
what looks like more traditional
graphics card packaging so we have a
user guide we have a powered by EVGA
they've updated their sticker that's a
nice sticker alright and they've got a
QuickStart guide okay the download
latest drivers from the Nvidia website
and all that good stuff next we have
mini HDMI to HDMI cable and dual molex
to PCIe 6 pin another one of those next
we have DVI to VGA and finally and DVI
to VGA may be relevant for this card
because if you upgraded your monitor
waiting for Duke Nukem Forever to come
out to play on it then that monitor may
be a VGA monitor that you've waited for
so now to go with your Duke Nukem
monitor you can use a Duke Nukem limited
edition sorry about that my battery died
so you can play your Duke Nukem game on
your Duke Nukem monitor with your
limited edition gtx 560 duke nukem
graphics card so here let's get the
plastic off this guy here so - and all
of its duke glory so you can see it
looks kind of nuclear and whatnot the
fan spinning it'll look a little
something like that on the bottom we
find a standard PCIe 16x interface on
the back we're going to find dual DVI
mini HDMI out as well as a second slot
used for exhaust although half of the
exhaust from this card is going to come
out somewhere over here on the other
side because it is not a rear exhaust
cooler we've got a couple heat pipes
built into the cooler I don't know if
you can see them from there you might be
able to through there do
pipes so those are connected to two
Finnair a's on either side of our center
what looks like a 92 millimeter fan so
it's a nice fan size this is looks like
pretty similar to a reference cooler but
not quite although I could be wrong I
actually don't really care the point of
the card is that it is Duke Nukem themed
to go along with your costume and your
belt buckle and your guide also we have
dual 6 pin PCI II power connectors here
on the back this card does support SLI
so you can connect it in up to 2-way SLI
but not 3-way SLI and just like the game
this card is Nvidia 3d vision ready
including 3d vision surround if you've
got two of them so thank you for
