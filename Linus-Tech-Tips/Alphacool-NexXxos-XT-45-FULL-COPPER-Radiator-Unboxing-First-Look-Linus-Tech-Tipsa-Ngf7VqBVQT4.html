the nexus dos xt 45 full copper
radiators from alpha cool I actually had
a funny conversation with slick where he
saw the box for these products and he
was like oh OC cool what brand is bad
and I was like you mean alpha cool he's
like oh I see yes jokes ahoy
so what's cool about these radiators is
the fact that they are as it says on the
box extremely high being full okay I
didn't get far enough into saying that
for you to actually get the joke
extremely heavy they are full copper so
they actually way more than the brass
aluminum or copper or brass or aluminum
or all aluminum or whatever other kinds
of radiator designs because copper is
heavier than all of those other metals
it doesn't actually translate into being
like that much have it's not like all
men I've got copper radiators my sister
like I'm not going to be able to move
around it's nothing like that but it
does add a little bit of a little bit of
half to them and once they're full of
water should actually make even more of
a difference now the main difference
between copper and aluminum is that
copper conducts heat better while
aluminum is generally regarded as a
better dissipater of heat so that's why
it's usually been an acceptable an
acceptable sort of shortcut to go with
copper tubes and then often brass end
tanks and aluminum fins
whereas alpha cool is gone okay know
what we're just going to go all freaking
out and we're going to go all copper
this is a thick style radiator so it's
it's not like it's not a slim radiator
it's a silence optimized radiator so it
uses a not very dense thin array in
order to allow you to use even though
the radiators thicker lower rpm Femmes
in order to achieve the cooling you need
it's also got a ton of different options
in terms of mounting some of which I
actually don't even understand why you
would need so they've got inlets and
outlets on both sides which means I mean
you could you could kind of like SLI
them so you could put a fan in between
you could run multiple radiators like
that so that'd be kind of cool actually
alternately you could sort
you know you could have it mounted this
way or this way or you could have
multiple devices going in and out so you
could go okay my cpu block and my GPU
block and my something else they're all
going to go in and then I'm going to
have one outlet so you could actually
use these radiators to split or join
multiple different parts of your loop
which is kind of cool as well
parallel I'd parapet parallel flow is
generally better than serial flow for
for the overall performance of the loop
especially if there are components that
are not particularly flow sensitive such
as GPU blocks where it might be the
difference between a couple degrees
running three blocks and parallel versus
running them in serial but the pressure
drop for running them in serial is much
much more dramatic and can negatively
affect the performance of something like
a CPU block so beyond that I don't know
how much there is to say in my case here
I've got one of their dual 120
millimeter radiators and one of their
single 120 millimeter 8000 this is cool
this out they're going all out on this
all copper thing the mounting hardware
for the fans is made of copper and look
at this even the plugs for the for the G
1/4 threaded holes at the top are made
of copper as well that's going to look
really really sharp in a build that's
that's all copper theme so if you have
exposed copper on your blocks like plexi
tops or whatever else like that that's
going to look really really good so the
single one twenty millimeter version is
just more of the same except smaller
it's the same thickness it's the same
fin density and it's the same mounting
options for the for the barbs and
fittings themselves so I think that
pretty much covers it thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the Alpha cool Nexus xt 45 called
full copper radiators don't forget to
