HDMI 2.1 is here that's actually really
cool every single time a display cable
gets updated I'm just excited it's a
good thing it's like it's gonna be like
more resolutions yeah
and master colors and faster oh yeah
right refresh rates good everything just
gets better also China is using DJI
drones to spy on the US rumor alleged
lamer alleged well allegedly yep yeah EA
Sports UFC threes egregious
implementation of micro transactions so
bad we'll be talking about that and
finally our former employer NCIX dot-com
bankrupt okay do you think I can roll
the intro and adjust the tilt of the
camera at the same time you got three
okay two one go
he's off he's gone around the table he's
grabbed a lever twisting the knob
oh the knobs broken off he's having some
issues you might have to go get a wrench
the intro is still going oh he's trying
to turn the camera anyways and use route
oh I have to sit up I have to do an ad
thing though dragging the ad in this
place thank you savage jerky
Thank You spectrum Thank You Marcille my
side my side Oh French yeah someone with
a French name and I would know oh
speaking French in really well though
hdmi 2.1 yeah sure are supposed to buy
sylvester silver do you mind if I have
the right I was ten this is supposed to
buy silver dracky on the forum and the
original article here is from
engadget.com let's go ahead and pull
that baby up boom hdmi two point one is
here with support for 10k and dynamic
HDR support and it is backwards
compatible with previous hdmi
specifications that 10k by the way
pretty weird 10k so-so 10k it looks like
is gonna be more like wide 8k yeah
except that that still makes it 10k yes
because the way that we define
resolutions because average you know Joe
can say okay nothing against people
named Joe kills just average Jeff
consumer yeah can't handle two numbers
yes
okay so that's why resolutions are just
something K now has to be a maximum of
three characters or else you've lost
them that's right before it's probably
pushing it that's why swear words
usually cap it for you can't go beyond
there
okay it's kind of a thing
how interesting um so be okay here hold
on back to this back to this chart that
we're looking at over on Engadget here
so this is this is interesting because
back in the day we had Full HD and that
was everyone we didn't really know that
as full HD outside of like you know like
yeah I mean 1920 by 1080 I think we
called it 1080p back then and then Full
HD was no no we didn't know what is Full
HD but that was kind of like used some
people inside enemy P Full HD yeah
because we called it Full HD because of
all the BS marketing that went on around
7:00 720 which was called HD HD okay is
complete and then 4k was like okay it's
I get the four so it's like four times
this and it's also about 4000 pixels
wide but then okay so this 5k this is
interesting
we've got about 5,000 pixels wide which
makes sense that's consistent with the
4k naming oh it's something a lot of
people don't know is that there was
actually a 2k standard yeah so it's 2048
by 1080 if I recall correctly but that
was only a dcpip cinema standard that
wasn't actually a consumer standard and
then everything got really confused with
4k because this resolution 3840 by 2160
is technically UHD Ultra HD it is not 4k
4k should be 4096 by 2160 because it
would be 4 times 2k but then we weren't
sure if we were using consumer
nomenclature or if we were using a
professional nomenclature and then the
5k thing I don't know I don't know what
the hell that is because that's like
widescreen 4k that's not 5 K because 5 K
the only 5 K devices that exist are the
Apple display on the iMac and LG's 5k
display that's also for Macs and then 8
K is 4 times 4k but actually this is 4
times UHD which is 4 times Full HD so
the decays never meant anything in the
first place and also
so 7680 is like dangerously not that
close to 8,000 at this point and then
10k is now apparently four times five K
at a different aspect ratio than eight K
for K full-hd you know what know that
was probably horrible sorry I'm sorry
sorry but I I have to express my
frustration to numbers is not that hard
we've been doing it since you know 640
by 480 it was good enough for me it's
good enough for the next generation I
hate this I hate everything about it
except that with new HDMI we can run
high resolution and I actually am
excited to see ultra wide TVs the fact
that these standards are making it into
the HDMI specification means you're
gonna see choices like this anytime you
go down a clip there's one that's really
high on reddit right now anytime you see
a clip of horizon zero dawn
that's an ultra wide it's like oh that's
probably how that game supposed to be
played TV's apparently 480p was first
gen HD what was that yeah HD CRTs I
think they could be like 480 progressive
or something or something something I
can't remember the HD term has been it's
been bastardized yeah there's a swear
word that's not four letters yes someone
in the twitch chat informed me of that
yeah I said usual I mean we could have
thought of a couple I'm sure I think I
said you because there are some compound
swear words that are definitely me and
four letters
so anyways there's a bunch of other cool
stuff forty-eight gigabit per second
that's pretty sick 4k at 120 Hertz
that's actually a lot more important to
me than 10k yes
8k at 60 Hertz that's pretty sweet I
guess personally I'm really not that
sold on above 4k at this point for yeah
but that 4k at 120 is like that's pretty
sweet
I mean 8k 60 Hertz would be great for
like a gigantic projector
I guess dynamic HDR variable refresh
rate yes finally oh man when I'm
surprised
Sony and Microsoft haven't been pushing
harder for variable refresh rate because
it would mask so many of the FPS dips
that you know in a good way in a good
way yeah like actually like Mask puts a
potentially negative term yes that's
true yeah but it is masking yeah but
like it would it would it would look a
lot better
Auto low latency mode so that's cool
contextual anti-aliasing removing
jaggies without noticeable blur that
sounds like if they get it right it'll
be great and if they don't then it won't
and sub 1 millisecond leg although
that'll be up to the TV makers in terms
of how they want to implement that and
how little lag there actually is because
they are constantly dinking around with
the signal trying to do whatever it is
that they're trying to wish they
wouldn't do yeah every time that I even
think about maybe looking into a TV
which I don't I haven't I've never
technically bought a TV so I mean like
if someone asks me or whatever else I
end up just being like I wish I could
just buy a ginormous monitor because I
don't even exist now yeah like can you
get like 60-inch 65 inch monitors no I
think the biggest that's what I'm
talking about she has a 42 because like
not only do I not want this stuff that's
on the TV right TV but like I'm in the
tuner it makes it worse it's not like oh
that's not a benefit it's like no I
really really wish that wasn't there I
would pay the same price just please
take it off right it's so annoying I've
got people asking me what's up with the
I just een thing so I went down there
hooked her up with a sick 150 terabyte
storage server in pink and white yeah
it's sweet it looks really clean it's
super cool and then while I was down
there I actually impromptu shot a studio
tour of her place because I actually
didn't take a camera print this is kind
of a funny story so the original plan
was for me to take a camera person down
and I was gonna stay down for like two
or three days and I was gonna hang out
with Jason
and do cuz he's actually working I don't
want to say what he's working on cuz his
might still be top secret but it's a
really cool build it's like sort of a
collab except I don't need to be there
so I don't need to be there for that
anymore so we shortened my trip and then
the other reason that I was going to
take a shooter was that I was probably
gonna do some kind of video for our
channel with Justine and then I was like
you know what forget it I just need to
do a short trip because I've been
traveling so much lately and you know
what I don't know if we're gonna have
time in one day to do the video for her
channel and one for mine don't worry
about it she already came up and she did
a a guest appearance for us
another thing that's never coming in I
think that it'll come out um forget it
I'm not gonna shoot a video and then
what's funny is Yvonne booked a room
with two beds just in case I like
changed my mind at the last second and
took a shoot here but I didn't but then
I got to Justine's place and I was like
this place is amazing this place is
unbelievable and so what I did was I
actually borrowed her shooter and then
just got the clips off the SD card back
here and it's actually being edited
right now nice you are gonna be blown
away and this is from the same person
who just did a deadmau5 studio tour her
place is unbelievable it's incredible
really cool yeah I'm stoked
I want one spoiling yes she probably has
literally 50 Xbox one controllers
literally what literally okay one more
spoiler yeah literally every amiibo
literally like properly using that term
every single one literally what the Hat
literally actually literally oh my god
that's so many amiibos she is a way
bigger nerd than I gave her credit for
there's a few I haven't been able to get
not collecting that many to be very
clear I have like four
I've wanted that I can't get yeah so her
place was super cool and I was really
excited too that's pretty cool yeah the
entire chai is just like literally
literally I found something that I
thought okay you know what forget it
that we'll get to it in the video okay
what were we talking about we were
technically on HDMI but I think we
passed on oh yeah in between things and
we're maybe doing DJs should we do flip
lay oh let's do DJ I first yeah DJ I wow
so this is supposed to by WM groom a K
on the forum and actually we're going
with our forum for the source of this
article here because apparently this was
a really epic post
oh no no Engadget is the original source
you always pull that up if it ever goes
it'll go it'll go it'll go I got posted
in the twitch oh there we go alright
Homeland Security claims that DJI drones
are spying for China and it released a
memo detailing what it believes to be DJ
eyes main targets wow that is like some
pretty serious business accusation going
on so this is a memo from the Los
Angeles office of the Immigration and
Customs Enforcement Bureau alleging that
the data captured from DJI drone
customers in the u.s. is being provided
to the Chinese government and the memo
originally in August says that and
there's a quote with moderate confidence
the Chinese based company DJI science
and technology is providing us critical
infrastructure and law enforcement data
to the Chinese government the
information is based on open source
reporting and a reliable source within
the unmanned aerial systems industry
with first and second hand access so
they conclude and this is more quotes
that it assesses with high confidence
the critical infrastructure and law
enforcement entities using DJI systems
are collecting sensitive intelligence
that the Chinese government
would use to conduct physical or cyber
attacks against the United States and
its population yeah so DJI appears to be
targeting users with the ability to
disrupt critical infrastructure
railroads utilities companies that
provide drinking water weapons storage
facilities DJ eyes statement though to
be clear this is all alleged DJI
statement says that the memo was based
on clearly false and misleading claims
shortly after however DJI released a
local data mode which allows users to
cut off drones from all internet
activity which they probably what
is my drone you do and they have had no
clue like actually in terms of reporting
like camera and telemetry data yeah
especially when I'm recording like other
than when I'm performing a firmware
update yeah or I couldn't actually only
be down I could see it reporting
something like if I'm flying in a no-fly
zone like that kind of stuffs coming but
again that shouldn't be going to a
foreign government that's for sure that
should be going to one that has
jurisdiction over the area that I am
flying you have to would you have to
register your drone or something now
right so that should be like when you
register your drone they like get a key
or something yep
Wow pretty brutal so now the ice memo
did focus on the drones used by
companies and institutions not the
drones flown by hobbyists so I don't
know if you necessarily have to stop you
know hovering your drone in the bedroom
to film yourself making a sex tape or
whatever I wouldn't recommend that
either either way you have blades yeah
you know blades and penises not a good
combination unless you don't want to
have kids anymore
like me but there's better ways to do
that yeah yeah oh speaking of which I
know you wanted to talk about stuff
that's on floatplane it's hilarious
okay it's actually so funny
I can't even one of teryn scenes in this
is so golden go like you know that
yeah oh my okay so oh my good stuff
that's on floatplane right now you guys
join the club it's cool all the cool
kids are there we've got case made of
radiators literally human owned it's out
literally a case made of radiators
literally it look at it literally case
made of radiators okay achieving the
ultimate 4k experience the first-ever
nvidia sponsored linus techniques video
of all time
literally I hope I hope talk comment on
this threat I haven't looked yet isn't
video shows will see that I hope so too
yeah there's no way it won't be a Terran
hosted a video recently on the elgato
stream deck I have so many problems with
that thing I'm watching this video yet
but we'll see um let's see what else we
got here we've got some exclusive stuff
we toured the server room that was
pretty cool well where's the Chum super
fun one uh-oh it's coming it's coming
oh that's already up on YouTube treyton
700 super powerful super thin gaming
laptop very cool and there it is cruel
pregnancy prank gone wrong it's amazing
how many people are giving us crap about
that gone wrong in the title I would
hope it's fairly obvious that that like
naming scheme is is played out at this
point and that anyone doing it now when
people are still really doing almost
2018 exactly anyone doing it now is
clearly just being ironic its
tongue-in-cheek it's just it's silly we
all know it's dumb gone sexual gone
wrong I don't think we've done a prank
in a while yeah so it's kind of a show
back to like when YouTube used to be
prank - prank - basically yeah like I
just I there were a couple people who
seemed legit upset about it no no it's
just it's it's a joke
it's just a it's just a joke bro it's
just a joke joke bro it's just a joke um
that was the worst in all seriousness
this wasn't a very funny joke it was
hilarious as an external person so there
it is a it is a - prank video yeah so
should I should I say you know else know
what the first one is
that one's right at the beginning okay
okay so the first prank is when Yvonne
got pregnant with our third she and I
got together and we were talking about
how guys are not that observant like
women can tell that each other are
pregnant like basically immediately I
don't know how they do it it's like they
can smell it on each other or something
yeah okay well I'll keep doing this so
women can tell right away and I was like
no there's no way guys would notice like
that's why we never asked like we never
bring it up because we can't tell the
difference between like eight months
pregnant and fat and you don't want to
run that risk because you're like
there's no way to win right and she was
like no they'll be able to tell I was
like they will not be able to tell and
they certainly won't say anything and so
she and I kind of made a little bet I
was like they won't be able to tell even
if and they'll think that it's me being
mean if I'm like constantly going after
you about how you're getting fat there's
they won't be able to tell they'll just
be like Linus is an ass
they will not figure out that you're
actually pregnant and yesterday that
while he's being an ass to his wife who
is also an employee of the company that
we all work at he's also everyone's boss
yep yep if we can dynamic and this is
great I would ask people like do you
think do you think he founds getting fat
meanwhile she has actually gained 15
pounds because she is pregnant they'd be
like oh no anyway there's actually a
part two to the prank that is not funny
at all but no it's Ashley Lillian it's a
good video
though sign up for floatplane having
having the second parts not funny though
having nothing to do with it it is
hilarious but like there's certain
points of time where I was like oh this
is so this is getting bad there you go
there you go guys go sign up for Flo
plain one week early access ish
it's not always a week but it's like
definitely early access also beautiful
videos with top-tier audio quality
top-tier audience one of the rock that
out there all right speaking of top-tier
quality why don't we talk about sc2
mitches post on the forum the original
article here is from astute gaming a
site that I've never heard of by neither
but sure one there you go and the
headline here whoa whoa oh the headline
oh EA Sports UFC three the single most
egregious implementation of
microtransactions to date so bad
whoa have you read any but this at all
you know my above all this is this is
not my deal
I'm not a UFC guy I'm not an EA Sports
guy and I rarely even have time for
gaming and I definitely don't pay for
micro transactions so I tend to pretty
much ignore them wherever they exist so
it offends me probably less than other
people because this is a game I was
never gonna play from a company whose
game I was never going to I still offend
you okay hit me reasons why I should
still friend you know
run run through what it is okay country
what it is right on top every single
technique ability fighter stat roll all
of it is in kwatak yeah is entirely
acquired and upgraded through a loop box
system okay where's things you can't
actually like buy a fighter
pressing the square button apparently
we're going for PlayStation here
pressing a square button to throw a
punch at an opponent the simplest and
most obvious mechanic in an MMA game
will do more damage if players have paid
money in an online PvP game it will do
more damage if players have paid money
sogood microtransactions are also the
only means of acquiring perks and booths
perks are powerful abilities that can be
equipped for a small number of fights
before expiring and boosts are temporary
enhancements that offer endurance boosts
and durability bonuses meaning you can
fight longer you can take less damage
and you can hit harder which is
literally the entire game boom so good
so basically EA is saying that UFC gamer
fans are just endless like like money
teats
that they can suck on pretty much does
that sounded like about what ei
apparently thinks so yeah they're their
audience here and you know what the
interesting thing is when when we when
we rolled out the keep on digging shirt
that was because of Ubisoft I know but
they've like taking turns
well yeah cuz EA was like always crap
like the keep on digging was only
relevant because Ubisoft scrapped and
this was like kind of a new thing like
EA I mean when was the last time
oh no cuz I remember like at that time
we did actually have some positive EA
liens yeah so they've switched and like
like Ubisoft is not doing everything
right right now yeah there's some
extremely valid complaints to be made
about certain games of there's like for
honor but they also launched as a south
park game South Park game was very fun
it's quite a long game lots of content
in it I haven't heard many people
complaining about that all the negative
reviews that I've seen on Steam because
there's quite a few of them are people
going why the heck do I need you play
that's not a new problem that's a
consistent that's been a problem it is a
dumb problem but is existed for a long
time I should play it did that just come
out fairly recently there's nothing like
stick of truth right it's extremely
similar to country
I'll take basically the same game
yeah it's just a different story yeah
like like the overworld is essentially
identical well yeah I mean so yeah but
like even town in Colorado what do you
want yeah I don't know new town in
Colorado and you can't redo the art
style because it's South Park so like
it's it's like the same thing and you do
the same thing where you go from like
house to house which you know me so many
house yeah yeah but like it is a very
good game it's funny yeah okay they said
it as a completely different combat
system I don't even remember the
previous one but yeah it's not it's not
like super next level or anything sure I
would recommend playing it on as heart
of the difficulties is yeah I will
yeah stick of truth is pretty easy yeah
okay cool like it's it's what do we even
say about this there's like nothing to
say you can't defend it you know like
you can't even play devil's advocate and
be like oh well you know maybe if nope
not at all and like this is this this
ties in with there's battlefront issues
going on right now while that's going on
they somehow thought it was okay to
throw it beta keys for this game with
this already implemented and this being
the style they take the
microtransactions out of battlefront 2
and then what just assume that
everyone's gonna be super ok with UFC
like a different target audience they're
not even gonna bring it up I don't think
this can be what is you haven't told me
any other time ok where were you going
mom you just got Loki owned I did what
you gotta preface that a little bit you
sent them 16 minutes ago ok this is not
fair
yes I did I did okay okay sorry one
moment okay well in the meantime um I'm
gonna I'm gonna go I'm gonna they look
pretty good mom
we actually they do it they look pretty
good hi I hope you have a good trip okay
bye me too yeah no problem oh dear okay
so let's jump into our sponsors sponsor
number one spectrum which glasses do you
want today
oh I'll just go straight up with these
so spectrum staring at a monitor all day
can be hard on your eyes overtime and
spectrum is an affordable solution to
help you keep from your eyes getting
fatigued there are software solutions to
reducing the amount of blue light that
goes from your monitor into your eyes
like flex and Twilight but they don't
give you the same kind of filtering that
an actual piece of glass or two pieces
if you have two eyes would they have
many features including that they are
stylish they you would well yeah that's
what they do yeah no you wait you know
what they do right yeah yeah okay so
basically they're like a yellow tinted
let oh actually you know what I never
noticed this before there was a there
was a pair that I was wearing years ago
like these yellow glasses are not an
entirely new concept there was a pair of
was wearing years ago and the reason I
stopped using it was because even though
I did find that it was more comfortable
over the course of the day was it had a
slight magnification on it spectrum has
absolutely nailed this no magnification
whatsoever at least on this particular
pair well I don't notice any on this one
either so that's pretty nice
anyway it's high-quality product
one-year warranty and extremely durable
and they have very low color distortions
so they're trying to block the
high-energy blue light while keeping
other colors as similar as possible so
you
check them out at spectrum loops you can
check them out in spectrum glasses comm
slash collection slash prospects and you
can get 10% off using offer code Linus
not bad
I'm gonna keep playing these yeah next
up we've got Oh was this this has
happened a handful of times and people
always like people always go tinfoil hat
on this kind of stuff when it happens
but have you said did you watch our
video about this the answer ones but no
I didn't interesting okay so this has
happened a handful of times where we
with no no intention of actually ever
working together we've done a review of
a product in this case it was the M
cable from marsai a product that claims
to improve the image quality of a device
that it's attached to I didn't see this
video okay so many sewing off please
explain it's over a hundred dollars okay
so one hundred and fifty bucks
okay for an EM cable yeah and what they
claim well you can see what they play
I'm reserving judgment because big
sponsors excellent graphics rejuvenation
advanced contextual anti-aliasing
contrast and detail enhancement leg free
real-time processing and an automatic
movie mode they claim and it works so
inside the cable see how there's a USB
connection yes it it's it it is actually
a powered signal processor and I saw on
the teeth on the TV end of the cable is
like huge yep so so it actually works
particularly well for certain
applications one of which is anime so I
think you're holding the cinema edition
yeah does a great job of like low
resolution anime collections you got a
bunch of like 480p anime it cleans up a
lot of the lines a lot of bandana about
2006 Warcraft video I got no that so
there's a limit to the tech so we went
oh oh we hooked it up with like original
unreal
it looked really good
ah the m cable cinema is actually
apparently also great for streaming
content that isn't something that we
tested extensively in ours
but we did take a look at a lot of
downsampled content and it managed up to
do a really good job you guys can't see
it because it's way too small but in
this corner and I'm sure if you go to
their website which is probably on green
yes I my Sai ink.com it shows that
there's like a processor and stuff going
on with yeah the cable sub 1 millisecond
leg we did not notice any discernible
lag even in like uh you know CRT
optimize the games like Super Mario
World it's pretty awesome and it's even
supports frame rates up to 1080p 120 so
you can legitimately game on the gaming
Edition here and yeah you guys you guys
should probably check it out though the
best use cases we found for it we're
older consoles but not too old so you
don't want something like an S but
something like an n64 PlayStation
PlayStation amazing sense actually yeah
you can clean up the quality of an
affair bit cuz to be fair an S is
already pretty clean old anime yeah um
streamed video I'm sorry oh that's where
I got confused by strange video I don't
necessarily mean live streaming although
it would help with that but any kind of
Internet video where it's like pretty
good but a little bit of tidy up would
probably not be a bad idea it's great
for that guess what VR lots of people
are using it for VR because the displays
are low resolution and it cleans up the
image a little bit yeah and apparently
the results are fantastic though I
actually haven't tried that personally
yet let me say it's interesting how like
a type of content is specifically better
that actually makes sense so check them
out at MRSA inc.com this is one of those
situations where we intended to do a
useless tech over a hundred ended up
spending anthony spent an entire week
because we knew we couldn't come out and
say this thing is really great unless we
absolutely proved it like if we were
going to come out and say it's it's junk
that would be easy because we've done
that before
it's a video on the $1000 like silver
HDMI cable
based on that their claims were BS which
they obviously were yeah and that's easy
that's like cheap easy content so we
were intending to do more cheap easy and
instead and you got I screwed paid
someone for an entire week video but
then they turned around another
sponsoring the land show so I guess that
worked out okay so uh
alright last Vaughn sir they're back I'm
gonna do something hot this week by the
way someone said their background looks
fake it's not I'm a can see I can like
pick things up from yeah I'm gonna type
I'm gonna type on this Underwood the
keys don't come back up like the world's
most convincing that's that's my can go
to the the frame convincing I think this
is an Nvidia ammo box why don't we have
it showing the top-secret it's the wrong
way around because it's a secret good
dog
I don't I don't know how to no it's so
much cooler all right there's the Nvidia
crowbar too yeah that's hidden that was
the that was the container that anyone
who reviewed the GTX 590 got the card in
and it was such a terrible shipping
container my first one was broken
because if they just put like packing
peanuts in like an anti-static bag in
there oh this is a metal container
there's no like there's no shock
absorption so my card was totally broken
so we're the chat Wow CGI has come a
long way oh you dicks
alright what do you want today we're
doing we're going hot you can do
whatever you want but I'm going with the
ghost peppers let's ghost pepper buffalo
sauce did you do it last week no I went
I went I ate an entire pack of the maple
maybe we both said we were like going to
do it or I said I was gonna do it and I
don't think either of us did it so yeah
oh I'm preparing myself these guys
really do make frickin hot jerky and not
just jerky they also make barbecue sauce
hot sauce and a spice rub so they're
Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of
the hottest peppers in the world the
jalapeno I'm just kidding
Carolina Reaper their drug is made with
great ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives I'm the globalists
accretive snack that is full of flavor
and spice that's not bad for you it's
definitely full of flavor yeah it's
definitely flow spice I'm starting with
a small piece I'm working my way up to
it today we've got 13 different flavors
of jerky I'm gonna regret that when some
of the favorites did you eat the whole
thing yep
well beating the sriracha bacon maple
buffalo bacon and traditional flavors
I'm partial to the Moho me too and the
much once alone with the white and black
packaging the sucker classic is that
classic no classic event traditionals
red no there's one little white and
black package that's really good
whatever the one with the white and
black package anyway Hughes offer code
LTT to save 10% on their products at the
link below sea salt I've what it was
itsomething pepper cracked pepper and
sea salt that was really good okay I'm
gonna keep working on this I'm gonna
slow and steady wins the race mode
Windows 10 is bringing tabs to every
whoa Microsoft is bringing tabs to every
Windows 10 app the spice flip that
around on me note a hex app was this
posted this on the forum Microsoft is
planning to add tabs like the ones in
your web browser to apps in Windows 10
allowing you to group apps together
they're calling this feature sets so say
you're working on a word document you
need to research data on the web or grab
notes from PowerPoint you can create
sets or tabs of these tasks in a single
window honestly I think this is actually
pretty sick yeah that sounds great I
really like this because oftentimes I'll
have a few different things that are for
one thing honestly my preferred method
is to just have more monitor space so I
can have it all open at the same time
you're gonna have Windows 7 anyway
that's so 8.1 or you running 8.1 okay
yeah okay I'm excited I wish this wasn't
news because I wish this was a thing
ages ago but I'm not gonna be down on
them for like doing something good so it
would also be really cool if like on the
taskbar at the bottom you can have your
set icon down there so you could like
click on it and then it would bring up
the multiple things instead of having it
all in one because often times I want a
copy between them and read one thing
while I'm typing one thing and having it
all in a set actually isn't very
conducive to that but it'll still be
really nice and oh except not for me so
oh well although a point was getting
painful because I think it's like less
than 10% of people are using it so a
compatibility for my platform it's like
really not great so file explorer even
notepad they'll eventually be extending
to app so that I have custom title bars
like Photoshop and they're aiming to let
iPhone and Android users start sets and
then resume them on a PC or vice versa
all I'm getting my spicy hiccups dang at
all right this is pretty bad this is
posted by heyyo on the forum websites
use your CPU to mine cryptocurrency even
when you close your browser that's new
well yeah like we've heard of we talked
about the Pirate Bay yeah and another
one I don't remember who was but another
one but this is new it's always it's
always been kind of a short-term thing
because it's only lasted while you were
on that page yeah luckily for these
websites a lot of people just leave
things open in tabs Wow look at this so
they've got a pop under that's opening
up another tab that is running this in
the background so you see once they
close it the CPU usage goes away Wow
close it so one researcher recently
documented 2500 sites
actively running crypto mining code in
visitors browsers that's a lot of sites
actually yeah that's pretty brutal
I wonder what these sites are though so
basically in a nutshell do to do so the
one that they're focused on is mining
Manero so this is like I don't know I
think everyone should be offended by
this like some people might not think
it's that big of a deal but this is
using your electricity and your CPU
resources so like your investment to
just make money from a site ranking your
CPU and it's potentially making your CPU
run really hot which you can potentially
reduce its lifespan especially if you're
on a mobile device and speaking of a
mobile device if you're on something
that's battery-powered this is going to
destroy your battery life if it's a
technique that's being used on any sites
that you visit regularly right now the
technique works on the latest version of
Chrome running on the latest versions of
Windows 7 and Windows 10 at the moment
no indication that it's being used on
other browsers or operating systems so
you're in compatibility that's freaking
brilliant it's the Apple approach you
know we are secure because no one's
making viruses for us you know what's
interesting root it ways that sound in
the dock have you heard about that uh
yeah I did see that hilarious you know
what's interesting is our render server
like the one that does our final export
before we upload yeah almost never
errors out on a render in fact I'm not
aware of it ever having done it windows
8.1 it's the embedded version the window
yes all right dude message me today it's
it's like the third a few days ago it's
like the third year anniversary of like
Windows 9 thing oh really cool yeah so
this is sort of a big deal
if you're into like that sort of thing
but our formal and our former employer
oh yeah
here we go where is it it's kind of
crazy yeah
so here hold on I'm gonna bring this up
search civil by party name so net link
Computer Inc oh wait hold on
so here's some here so here you can see
I actually didn't even know you can do
this of course that makes sense so you
can search for lawsuits or like you can
search for court cases by party name
it's a net linked Computer Inc small
claim small claim small claim small
claims four times over the over the last
you know since 2011 and boom net link
Computer Inc Bora Group Inc the net link
Computer Inc supreme bankruptcy December
1st 2017 so this just went down my
formal my former employer is I mean is
this up oh no I think it's still loading
no no I'm pretty sure it's still loading
oh oh yeah there we go the site still up
I really don't know that I would
necessarily recommend apparently
shopping there though getting your stuff
after you buy it has been a little bit
of an issue recently for a while yep so
I yeah I haven't done any I haven't done
any pre like sort of research here but
I'm heading over to the I'm heading over
to the forum ok restructuring ok
important service announcement we
figured it's time to write a formal post
about the restructuring Wow I'm pretty
sure this thread has been pruned because
I know that there were other things in
here before huh
alright NCIX supreme bankruptcy
confirmed okay what is supreme is there
sub supreme bankruptcy I have no idea it
sounds crazy like what
Wow yeah I've had a lot of people know
fire to box I did not cause this um no I
mean that okay I don't know I don't know
well how much should I talk about right
now scale of 1 to 10 like a 6 or 6 okay
like not not that I so I left
partly because I saw a great opportunity
in content creation online and partly
because I had some significant or even
closer to 3 fundamental disagreements
with senior management okay particularly
the owner over what exactly we needed to
do in terms of our direction as a
company I also left this was a
significant part of the reason for my
departure I also left because the people
that I had been mentored by they're the
people that I had really felt like I
learned a lot from were departing and
they sometimes for very good reasons I'm
not going to defend the conduct and job
performance of at least one of them but
some of them were forced out by
extraordinarily in my opinion
extraordinarily poor management
decisions and that ultimately led me to
believe that I could do it better so I
had an opportunity and I thought I could
do it better and I thought that my
company made my way would be something
that would make me happier too
up in the morning and go to it's made me
happier well I'm glad to hear that uh I
know you're having a moment I just want
to add some comedy yeah thank you
and that was ultimately why I left I
didn't agree with the strategy I thought
and this was something that I pitched
about six and a half years ago I thought
the direction for us to go and meet by
us I mean I was at NCIX I was one of the
top product management people there I
might have been a category manager at
that point can't remember anyway I was
basically at or near the highest rank
that you could really have in the
company there before and I don't wanna
you know the odds of anyone that this
might apply to ever watching this stream
are pretty low but my opinion of some of
the people that were hired in senior
positions couldn't possibly be any lower
so you know that was that was though
there were some bad decisions there as
well
anyway where was I where was I going
with this right so the direction that I
had wanted to go was to try to get
acquired and the way to try and get
acquired is to have some kind of a value
that somebody else would want and it
wasn't gonna be the website let's be
honest it wasn't going to be the
logistics system and you know I can't
say too much about what NCIX had because
you know I don't want to I don't want to
be disrespectful of their privacy as a
company but I will tell you that it
wasn't you know robot arms and you know
robot eyes and automated conveyor belts
like what state-of-the-art warehouses
were doing even back then it was not
that so it wasn't gonna be the
warehousing system it wasn't going to be
the inventory management system I can
tell you that much it wasn't going to be
the the super-talented team and there
were talented people on it obviously
like I was part of it I think I was
pretty talented there were definitely
talented people on it but I don't know
that that was visible enough externally
and I think that you would end up with a
lot of in order to acquire a team you'd
have ended up with a lot of deadweight
and I don't even necessarily mean in
terms of people like the locations that
we had least I think at one point there
were three locations in Richmond which
is a small city just to give you guys
some idea of why that wouldn't be a good
idea so so my concept for what we could
build having seen the partnership
between Nvidia with the shield and EB
Games in the States where I think the
shield was initially only available to
preview it at EB Games in the States and
I was like why would they make it
exclusive to them and I could be
remembering some little detail of this
wrong maybe it was a Nintendo system I
don't know whatever the point is the
reason that they partnered with them was
that they still had at that time anyway
4,500 locations which has a value
another thing that I thought could have
a value would be a distribution system
slash business model that combatted one
of the biggest difficulties of doing
business in Canada which is extremely
high shipping cost it deters customers
from shopping online and it enables
brick and mortar to continue to be
competitive here because shipping a case
across the country from new AG is like
$7 shipping a case across this country
from NCIX could be as much as 30 40 60
dollars depending on how remote you are
so you know it was a constant refrain
from customers shipping kills the deal
you'd hear it all the time so the
concept that I pitched was like an NCI
x-lite these would be extremely small
stores like maybe 600 to 800 square feet
really small stores with really small
storefronts that were effectively kind
of ordering kiosks and the idea was that
you'd have technical services so you
could walk into small communities like
Kamloops and displace the mom-and-pop
shops with a trusted brand believe it or
not at the time we were a trusted brand
you could displace those mom-and-pop
shops as a trusted brand you could
probably cover your lease and your
employee overhead
with the services business that you're
doing then you would stock like two SKUs
tops of every category so that if
someone walked in they could build like
something basically the computer at any
given time which is pretty easy to
define it's really easy to do so right
now you would stock assuming that you
there is inventory you would stock the
8,400 for Intel and you would stalk the
Verizon five sixteen hundred or
something along those lines and then
you'd have like a motherboard for each
of them you'd have an eight gig stick
and a 16 gig stick and like obviously
multiples of each of these but the idea
is that if someone just like wanted like
the computer right now like the bang for
the buck sweet one that everyone wants
you could just walk in and buy it or we
would build a system and it wouldn't be
a complicated system but we would have a
network of trucks that would crisscross
the country constantly between the two
locations that we had in the West and in
the east so that the model would be you
can shop online and you can ship to your
house or we'd have these little tiny low
overhead locations scattered across the
country and you could get free pickup at
any location and this was well before
Amazon started doing pickup so whoa
insects actually sounds really cool this
was an ICU never happened he was
pitching I pitched this this is what I
wanted to do instead of these monolithic
high overhead extraordinarily expensive
retail stores in order to you know I the
writing was on the wall like seven years
ago Amazon was going to kill us all like
the people who were paying attention
knew this already so the idea was to
build this infrastructure so that when
Amazon decided to hit the switch and you
can see now they're running around
acquiring people that have
infrastructure that they like like Whole
Foods the idea was that when they came
in they could buy us and that never
happened if I'd had the resources I
think that could have been the way for
me to never have to work again like if I
could have built might like I even to go
back like if I was the one who had the
resources that I have today even that
might have been a model that I would
have pursued I really believed in it I
thought that it was a great opportunity
it's not worth it now oh no you'd never
make it now no but I should PI NCIX and
do that I couldn't afford NCIX
not because I couldn't afford like what
NCIX is net value is right now but I
couldn't afford an STI X's overhead the
monthly expenses even with all the
layoffs that they've done there's still
a lot of things there's still a lot of
buildings there's still a lot of
inventory so when we didn't do that and
when we continued marching down the
obviously no longer viable big-box
retail path I figured out that I had to
get out so ultimately the reason that I
ended up leaving NCIX and taking this
guy with me and me thanks for coming
along well um yeah that I was thinking
that five-year thing it's actually like
seven or something or eight or something
yeah it's kind of ridiculous
so anyway sorry I forget where I was
going with that
right so so what happened when I left
was I had decided to leave and the
reason that I was able to take the line
is tech tips channel and so to be clear
I take no pleasure whatsoever in NCI x's
demise you know and I've seen a lot of
horror stories online but however
they've treated other people everyone
they're all the way up to Steve the
owner and Mary his wife they have always
treated me with the utmost kindness and
respect I have not had personal bad
experiences with anyone there from from
HR to my colleagues to I shouldn't say
everyone there were some there were some
some port aspiring decisions made but at
the very highest level that at least the
people that I consider to be at the
highest level you know I take no
pleasure from this I learned a lot there
like I am everything I underst
and about business at what to do right
what to do wrong it was ultimately from
them I I didn't go to school for
business management I don't have an MBA
I don't I don't actually have any formal
education everything I learned was
school of hard knocks and NCIX was a
stupendous proving ground for me so you
know I take no pleasure in this but
where was I going with this but how'd
you go the channel right how I got the
channel so so ultimately I was able
right right right so I'm very grateful
to them for giving me the opportunity to
build up this channel and then
ultimately take it with me because the
deal was look I'm leaving because I
disagree with some of the stuff we're
doing and you my boss is gone who I
loved and that sucks and so I'm out so
you can either let me walk away to
another retailer and I mean you know I
didn't have four million subscribers and
a team of you know 19 people that's like
a world class video production team like
I hadn't built any of this yet yeah we
were pretty far from it yeah we were a
long way away from this but for me
personally anyway my stock was high
enough that I could have walked into
literally any electronics entity and
gone like this and I would have had a
job so I wasn't concerned about getting
a job what I was concerned about was
building a team and building something
and making sure that Luke and Edie who
were both out of work if I walked out of
there and didn't manage to take them
with me making sure that they stayed
employed so the deal was look I'm
leaving but if we can work out a deal
where I take the Linus tech tips YouTube
channel the trademark and any associated
assets which now that this is going on
I'm really happy we did buy the book
with a lawyer get to that more later but
if I take all that stuff with me I'll
sign a non-compete for I believe it was
two years but it ended up getting
extended two three and four pennies on
the dollar I'll come back and I'll
continue to support the end
cix tech tips channel so that you don't
have to replace me immediately also I'll
give you as much notice for my departure
as you need so I had originally planned
on giving somewhere between a month and
six weeks notice I ended up giving about
five months notice although in fairness
I phoned in about the last three weeks
of it by then I had trained my
replacements for pretty much everything
I didn't really know what to do with
five months like um like I tried okay I
tried so the fact that we the fact that
we acquired those assets legally is
really important because if some if the
like the bankruptcy lawyers if whoever
NCIX as creditors are were to find that
it had an asset that was worth a
significant amount of money and let me
tell you Linus tech tips is worth a
significant amount of money both as a
brand and as a YouTube channel at this
point although you know no I'm not gonna
say no thanks to NSA X but most of that
development has been done in the five
years similar but if it was found that
that asset wasn't transferred Title II
then it could also be found that NCIX
still had some claim to make against it
and then their creditors would as well
so Steve I trusted to never do anything
untoward with me by predators creditors
all bets are off I really didn't you
know I didn't think it would come to
this I take no pleasure in it but that's
what happened and yeah that was some
context there we broke off at what two
hundred fourteen thousand subscribers or
something like that yeah we're now at
four point eight million yeah there's
kind of been a lot of work done yeah
we've been we've been going pretty hard
on it so yeah yeah
so aligned is tech tips documentary no
no that probably won't happen we
actually tried to do a behind this like
a behind the blow type thing here and it
was a total disaster we brought in a
third-party film crew they like shot a
bunch of stuff then they submitted a
rough cut that was awful totally
unusable and then we tried to edit it
together ourselves but by then our team
was like 60% bigger so like different
yeah like a third of our staff wasn't in
the video and you know it doesn't make
sense yeah alright so what else let me
out for topics yeah that wasn't wow that
was kind of a fricking downer of a topic
man also take a long time I'm surprised
people are still watching
sheesh let's find something exciting
it's pretty interesting yeah I guess so
it's like learning that before coke came
out it was green I'm like I'm like damn
let's just find like something like one
cool topic to do and then these are all
terrible Oh tinder tinder tests using AI
to suggest who to super like they're
testing a new feature called super
likable that intermittently presents a
card on your screen and offers you a
bonus super like that can be sent to one
of four people present it's presented on
the card the original Super Lake was
designed as a way to signal your
interest in a potential match was
stronger than others but users have a
limited number per day Wow how many of
those could you possibly need per day
wow I'm not I mean like I'm sort of pre
online dating so I don't really get like
a social hub sheesh
like somewhere light like deep like LA
or San Fran if you just like go through
a few hundred people and you're just
like yeah there's many more you know
what I mean I don't know I don't feel
like it's like that up here huh I don't
know okay
well I'm bored of that already cuz this
is way better yep there's officially
Mario series yeah so I like super need
some okay this also isn't the first time
that Nintendo has tried to do serial I
thought it was kind of interesting
because right now they're huge
cuz the switch is like wildly
mildly successful but at a previous time
of them being huge they also tried to
roll out a cereal and this one is not
just cereal the box itself is
essentially an amiibo so you tap the box
on your switch and you get stuff in game
wow it unlocks gold coins and hearts in
Super Mario Odyssey hits shelves
mid-month
okay I'm down for that alright well
that's pretty much it o.o LOL max root
access issue if you have if you have a
Mac and you're watching the show you
should maybe look it up on your own it's
not in here but I'm pretty sure if
someone literally just attempts to sign
in as username root with no password
they just have all the stuff alright
yeah I I'm not entirely sure in all the
details it's not in the doc but if you
have a Mac look into it because it's a
big deal so thanks for watching guys
we'll see you again next week same
bat-time same bat-channel
no don't be down
apparently it's patched so just update
yeah there you go yeah
