me about four months ago I didn't open
it because I already have a gaming
capable media center PC which can run
steam in-home streaming in big picture
mode without any help from standalone
hardware and frankly I just haven't had
much time to play games lately anyway
but better late than never right
the phoenix auteur is a full-size
minimalistic li designed keyboard
complete with gold-plated cherry MX
brown switches check it out at the link
in the video description to learn more
so in terms of i/o the steam link is
equipped with three USB 2.0 ports HDMI
1.4 for video out 100 megabit per second
Ethernet and a connection for the 5 volt
2 and a half amp power port that's only
12 and a half Watts by the way and it's
otherwise completely devoid of
adornments save for the Steam logo on
the top cover but come on who's
interested in the top cover we can get
under the hood and okay well we should
have known that based on the 2005 class
with the exception of HDMI connectivity
that we weren't going to find much in
here the details are actually fairly
sparse online with valve not even
bothering to put actual hardware under
the hardware specifications on the
product page but with a little more
digging
we found a reddit post and the steam
link SDK post on github that shed a
little more light on the situation the
steam link features a single core arm v7
processor running at about one gigahertz
so similar to the Raspberry Pi 2 model B
with a dedicated hardware h.264 decoder
256 Meg's of RAM and 500 Meg's of flash
storage though it should be noted that
is not for user storage or games or
anything it is intended to be used for
the custom Linux based operating system
that it runs and presumably any
applicable steam link app releases that
are developed thanks to the availability
of the aforementioned SDK now as yet I
can't find any information other than
the original valve announcement on
ongoing steam link app projects but let
me know in the comments if you've heard
something that I haven't while this
Hardware isn't anywhere near capable of
chilling and watching Netflix as the
kids say in ultra HD 1080 Twitch Netflix
or YouTube should be possible if not the
greatest experiences and surely there
could be other interesting uses for it
but enough speculation what does the
steam link do today well as
helpfully points out in their short and
very adorable animated promotional video
it takes the power of your gaming PC
uses that to render games and code the
frames as a video stream and transmit
them over your home network by the way
do yourself a favor and use the wired
connection I know it's only 100 megabit
but trust me in-home streaming does not
use more than 50 to 60 megabit per
second and better latency reliability is
worth it to the steam link so all the
steam link does is take inputs from the
user via USB from the couch and transmit
those back to the PCs somewhere else in
the house to control the game and
control your flexibility is a very
strong point your options include mouse
keyboard gamepad or multiples of those
using a USB hub or even thanks to
ongoing hard work from developers more
exotic stuff like racing wheels thanks
to a third-party tool called virtual
here that allows Windows Mac and Linux
users to share peripherals over the
network sounds a lot like invidious game
stream doesn't it well yeah actually
but unlike game stream devices like
Nvidia shield lineup it does not work
with GeForce now you can check out my
full review of Nvidia Zaandam and
internet game streaming service here and
there are no handheld gaming devices
that run steam yet but it is much
cheaper than a shield console and it
works with both Nvidia and AMD graphics
cards in the source gaming rig but then
how well does it work pretty darn well I
mean setup was a breeze mostly assuming
that the steam link and your PC are on
the same subnet you basically power on
your computer and make sure it's running
Steam select the stream PC in the list
of connections note down that four-digit
pin and enter it on the streaming pc
boom you're done although there are some
tips that I have to make your life as
simple as ours was number one use a wire
number two if you must use wireless use
5 gigahertz to avoid common 2.4
gigahertz interferers like microwaves
and baby monitors your router should
have an option to create separate SSIDs
for
different bands just note though that
your five gigahertz range is likely
inferior to your 2.4 gigahertz range so
make sure that you're close enough to
consistently get your full bandwidth in
spite of the usual network congestion so
while the steam link wasn't perfect at
release that's one of the nice things
about reviewing a product months down
the line it tells you if the
manufacturer really cares or if they've
given up support to start working on the
next thing and I really have to hand it
to valve here each changelog seems to be
a direct response to the issues and
requests that are brought up in the
community forums bringing since release
considerable improvements to stream
reliability enabling seemingly essential
features like being able to forget a
wireless network and putting your xbox
controller to sleep when powering down
the link and thanks to another recent
update 32-bit CRC checking to detect and
take action to correct corrupt network
packets for a more pain-free reliable
experience
I mean honestly as far as I can tell the
majority of the negative comments
surrounding the steam link these days
are due to issues that are 100%
preventable which is pretty cool so what
about that leg then gaming or the
network and it sounds great but is it
actually usable well yeah after a couple
of matchmaker games in rocket League and
blitzing through the first couple levels
in Metro last light our new writer did I
mention that this video is the very
first work of a new team member you can
let him know in the comments if you
hated it was thoroughly impressed by the
lack of any noticeable input lag however
upon switching to csgo it did become
apparent that there was some amount of
legs so it was time then to break out
the makeymakey and the 240 FPS iphone
camera to uncover the extent of it
not actually bad but it ties in pretty
well to the conclusion that most of you
were probably expecting here it's
perfectly fine for single-player and
casual multiplayer games however I
couldn't recommend it for anyone wanting
to play competitively in games like csgo
Street
fighter or the like that is to say
unless you're playing against your
little cousin who's in town for a visit
which leaves us only some closing
thoughts game support used to be a major
issue with steam in-home streaming where
you'd frequently have to run upstairs
click a stupid pop-up box run downstairs
see if it's working rinse and repeat
until tired but thanks to the steam
Link's ability to tab out and use your
steam link keyboard and mouse as though
you are sitting in front of that
computer it is no longer an issue and
this also addresses really most of the
need for apps like Netflix since you can
also use it for that pretty cool the
theme link does not replace a console or
a dedicated gaming PC connected to the
TV remember that the remote computer
cannot be used for little Sally's book
report while you defeat dragons
downstairs but as it stands the steam
link is inexpensive enough and once
configured easy enough to use that in a
house with multiple screens and at least
one serious gamer I can't think of a
good reason
not to pick one up crunchyroll is the
site created by anime fans for anime
