the soos VG 278 144 Hertz LED backlit
LCD monitor this is 3d vision ready with
light boost and is basically for twitch
gaming whether you're playing like I
don't know whatever the kids are playing
these days counter-strike go or I was
gonna say League of Legends because I
know lots of people play that though
it's not exactly a quick game so you
clicks giving me that looks like you
have no idea talking bug I do know what
I'm talking about and I do know about
League of Legends in the twitch game but
I also know and if you were at an elite
level League of Legends it would be more
twitch and he's giving me the unknown so
do you see there do you know what I'm
talking about he's not giving me the
knight anymore um so I'm gonna go ahead
and take out some phone here they're
using oh this is like a semi-soft phone
it has some flex to it however if it did
take a serious you know beating at any
point in time then it would probably
break and lose some of its structural
integrity however what you guys will
notice about the monitor is that there's
a lot of foam around it so a lot of LCDs
I see the LCD actually only goes to here
so there's a huge gap here a lot of LCDs
these days only have a tiny gap between
the outside of the box and the front of
the panel which if your name is Linus
and you worry about packaging is a deep
of deep concern to you because if
anything were to hit that box hard
enough to puncture it it basically go
right through your brand-new LCD I mean
hogs are excellent that you're shipping
carrier as long as you got insurance is
going to like deal with it and
everything but why take that risk if you
don't have to there's the base and
everything is uh packed so I'm going to
assemble the monitor we'll be back in
just a moment now actually before we
assemble it I want to show you all the
parts that come with it so you've got an
Asus VIP member notice as well as your
warranty information Asus has a fairly
unique warranty policy for their M LCDs
which apparently is not outlined on the
box at all but they do have a zero
bright guarantee
so that means yes zero whereas a lot of
their competitors will not necessarily
have zero bright dots guaranteed I want
to go over the specs as well so two
millisecond response times and it's
going to need them if it's going to be
operating at 144 Hertz if you have slow
pixel response times that is to say that
when the color changes the pixel takes a
while to register it you can put
whatever refresh rate you want on the
monitor won't make any difference to how
blurry and ugly the image looks so
you're going to have to have a super
fast panel to achieve this 50 million to
one high contrast ratio probably
optimistic but you know okay
Full HD 1080p HDMI although you're not
going to want to use that if you're
going to want to get those high refresh
rates you want to use dual link DVI
actually yes doing the DDI tilt swivel
and height adjust splendid video
television technology and video 3d
vision to light boost which makes a huge
huge difference although you'll only be
using 120 Hertz for light boost the 144
T the 144 Hertz feature is more for 2d
non stereoscopic gaming because it gives
you just that little bit of extra time
to react to something because it'll give
you the information a little bit sooner
than a monitor that is taking that go
get here think of it this way you've got
a 60 Hertz panel there's going to be up
to one sixtieth of a second for it to
show you something that your video card
already knew about okay whereas if you
have a 144 Hertz panel it will be less
it will be okay at at worst-case
scenario it will be one one hundred and
forty fourth of a second to show you the
new information of the graphics card has
obtained so think of it that way it
keeps giving you the information a
little bit faster okay so where that guy
is it's more accurate there included
accessories so we've got a couple of
screws for assembling it nothing special
there audio cable for pass-through vga
cable blue don't worry about that power
cable dual link DVI cable got some heft
to it as well as the base station now
we'll put it together and we'll show you
the completed monitor now that we've
assembled everything we're ready to go
ahead and have a look this is pretty
similar to a sis's other 27 inch 1080p 3
vision to ready monitor okay and that is
got all of your usual
just I'm just going to go ahead and show
you guys it's going to pop that pin out
at the back in order to enable the
height adjust just like that you've got
a lot of height adjust here you've also
got your tilt you got your pivot okay
which is done actually under the under
the base here there's a rotating piece
right there and then uh we don't have
that one
you got your cable management right here
speaking of cables all the different
cables that you can plug into it are
located down here at the bottom so
you've got your audio pass-through as
well as your headphone jack your HDMI in
DVI in vga in as well as your power in
there right there over on the other side
of the of the pillar at the middle so
you can see tactile buttons along the
bottom here for all of your basic
monitor controls I still prefer tactile
buttons except in very rare cases where
I like you know I like the 24 20 T from
from Ben q that one's kind of cool with
the touch sensitive buttons but other
than that tactile is good lots of
cooling on this monitor which is
important because in order to achieve
the 144 Hertz refresh rate asus has
essentially overclocked the engine
inside this monitor in order to get it
to process pixels and process the images
faster than it's actually I guess
supposed to which isn't to say that
they're not going to throw all of their
warranty support behind it and they're
going to stand behind the product but
they're pretty much tuning the monitor
before they release it to market so
that's the key difference between this
one and the 120 Hertz version so if
you're looking for the fastest LCD
monitor to date right there thank you
