what could possibly justify the
existence of a bluetooth speaker this
expensive can't figure it out
curious well given the small percentage
of these things that I agree to review
apparently I was curious too because I
decided to do it here's my review of the
fugu sport a 200-dollar bluetooth
speaker ok fugu you got my attention now
better be amazing in the box you'll find
a nice flat micro USB cable a flat
three-and-a-half millimeter audio
connector in case you want to hook your
audio source up directly to the
three-and-a-half millimeter input on the
side of the speaker a 2.1 amp wall wart
that fugu says can charge the unit in
under four hours and a little cloth
baggie for all those accessories that I
just mentioned oh right and I guess
there's a speaker to this bad boys got
for active drivers to need imeem magnet
tweeters to need Anjum magnet aluminum
dome mid-range drivers with one pair on
each side and then two passive radiators
for base which means you can position it
somewhere in the middle of a group of
people and everyone can hear it alright
and it promises an impressive 40 hour
battery life at 50 percent volume which
is leagues ahead of most of the stuff
this size it's got the usual assortment
of buttons so power on and bluetooth on
one side volume up volume down in a call
button on the top and finally USB power
in that three-and-a-half millimeter jack
that I mentioned on the other side the
bottom can connect to a few optional
accessories including a multi mount for
things like carabiners a strap mount or
even a bike mount and other than that
the outside looks like any other
Bluetooth speaker internally the
speakers are angled upward eight degrees
since a Bluetooth speaker is rarely at
the same level as your head when you're
listening to it I mean you could be that
rarely happens hopefully it supports the
higher quality apdex codec for better
sound quality overall over Bluetooth and
like most of these devices it includes
an omnidirectional microphone for
speakerphone operation in Syrian you
know
and all that stuff once powered on you
are greeted with speaker is on some
unreasonably loud system noises that
like so many Bluetooth speakers and this
is really annoying can't be turned down
but at least the pairing process itself
is pretty painless music listening
actually fairly good overall but when I
compared to straight-up audio quality
against simple audios go a product that
costs half as much I came away happy
that the bass was so much fuller and the
speaker didn't jump around every time a
bass note played but maybe a little bit
disappointed by the lack of clarity in
the heights compared to the similarly
priced Ultimate Ears ue boom I was happy
with the sound quality at moderate
volumes but I was disappointed by the
overall loudness given the 95 decibel
rating and claims that the fugu is
suitable for party use that is simply
not the case unless your parties look a
little something like this with that
said it's totally loud enough for
personal use and if you wanted to you'd
have no problem being one of those super
cool dudes poles who wears a speaker
like a fashion accessory while they walk
down the street so there you go but
claims of audiophile grade sound or
fantastic out-of-this-world battery life
or whatever nonsense every Bluetooth
speaker company and their dog makes all
day would not have gotten my attention
the fugu has something different
swappable jackets no I'm just kidding
that wasn't it there's more I mean it
has swappable jackets but more
importantly all of them are ip67
waterproof dirt proof and dust proof you
can get the speaker with the style
jacket which looks nice I guess the
sport jacket the one we have with
rubberized corners for drop resistance
or the tough jacket with an aluminum
frame just in case you accidentally run
over it with your car but manufacturer
claims are not enough for us here and we
wanted to know just how well the speaker
will hold up to torture if it's rated to
handle 30 minutes under a meter of water
which it is then surely it can handle
hanging out with me for one of my nice
long showers no all right well how about
just water then
sweet aggressive water still okay I'm
tired and I'm just kind of letting it
sit there that's fine - very nice
conclusion time it's again I cannot
emphasize this enough
$200 and there are louder options out
there for 360 degree listening with a
group of friends okay so with that out
of the way does this product have a
right to exist then I think so yeah with
a battery that lasts for about a day and
a half of solid listening at a
reasonable volume and an enclosure that
I subjectively find stylish and
objectively find rugged then if you're
the kind of person who is a bit of a
scatterbrain like me and is likely to
forget to charge your speaker knock it
in the water and then finally drop it
six feet to the ground on the concrete
or on the dirt then expect it to still
work then I guess this one's for you and
also you should really be more careful
with your stuff this thing's expensive
