waves right now and it's kind of ironic
because it's called a wildfire so how
could it make waves waves are made of
water makes no sense at all but what I
mean by making waves is that the
Internet's are collectively very excited
about this little products so this is
the wildfire sata3 SSD from patriot this
is the 120 gig version although it is
available in other capacities let's go
ahead and look at the side of the
package look at the back of the package
so what do they have to say for
themselves it's a two and a half inch
form factor low power consumption stay
the three compatible okay good shock and
vibration resistant it better be silent
operation once again it better be and
free technical support okay that's good
to know
on the side we see nothing on the bottom
we see nothing really notable I could
come in a party here six that actually
it doesn't matter all right so we've got
a little window at the front let's open
that up okay well here's where all the
interesting stuff is oh that's kind of
interesting look at that they give you a
little map of all of the pin notes used
for the power and the signals on the on
the drive this is like a schematic of
the drive what's kind of neat I've never
seen that included for the consumers
unless you look pretty deep into the
manufacturer website or like the SATA
standards website okay installation
instructions here for desktops and
notebooks as well as some information
about the drive so let's have a look
okay so it's available in 120 240 and
480 gig capacities it supports raid 0 1
+ 0 + 1 if you use to drive though it
would support any raid level you desire
if you use more data retention is up to
five years at 25 degrees mean time
between failure is 1,500,000 hours it
does support smart drive monitoring and
its power consumption is less than 5
Watts at max operational peak running
miss okay environmental this or that
operation shock certification you know
it's funny that they don't include an
performance metrics on the packaging
because really that's what the Wildfire
is all about this is a second-generation
SandForce
controller base drive so the 2281
controller and it uses toggle chips oh
okay
interesting so I guess they could pack
two drives in one package if they wanted
to that's how they design their
packaging but they've given me one drive
and a three and a half to two and a half
inch adapter it's funny they didn't even
say they included an adapter on the
outside here seems like kind of an
oversight doesn't it because that's like
a great selling point anyway okay so
uses toggle chips in addition to that
advanced controller to achieve higher I
ops so that is for KI ops I o'the per
second which means that in a desktop or
even a server workload this drive will
perform as fast as anything else out
there in the market for a single SATA
three six gigabit per second drive
because the provokin the performance of
an SSD breaks down into a few different
things you got one your controller so
the controller dictates what kind of a
SATA interface you can hook up to it it
dictates how much processing it can do
on the data for example with a sand
force drive and this uses a sand force
controller it's actually going to be
compressing the data before it writes it
to the drive in order to save the net
that is the flash from being overly worn
out so actually if it writes one gig of
data it might actually only physically
write 750 negative data in theoretically
some types of data are more or less
compressible than others so that
intelligence in the processor allows it
to do that on the fly without you ever
even being aware of it and it's very
proving technology at this point so
you've got your controller okay the
other thing you have is obviously your
interface which is pretty much dictated
by the controller next you have the
flash so if you're using a low quality
flash the controller can only read and
write so fast to it all so it's only
gonna last so long okay
the quality of the Nano
how long it's going to last as well as
the speed so this is using the fastest
and end out there right now so that is
why in terms of thorough put you're not
gonna see a drive like this rated for
more megabytes per second sequential
than other drives on the market but what
you will see is that it is rated for
better random performance so you know
when you're you've got a video editing
in the background you've got your
antivirus running and you get like a MSN
message for example which is a very very
small piece of data this is going to be
able to do it more quickly than an SSD
that doesn't perform little random
things as well as this one does so let's
have a look at the included two and a
half inch drive adapter so this is a
pretty standard one I've seen these a
number of times there's like one om who
makes these and everyone including
Corsair ocz and I guess Patriot uses
them so it comes with all the screws you
need to mount the SSD to the adapter
tray and then the adapter tray to your
case so let's have a quick close up look
at the Wildfire so it's got a great
matte black finish on the top which is
gonna look really sharp in your case
nice Patriot sticker that's a black
silver yes a shiny silver sticker those
are more expensive you know you got it
you got a sort of notice these things
okay you got some red on there this is
also nice too nice little touch you've
got kind of a chromed shiny edge going
all the way around the drive can you see
the flash there like it's quite shiny
okay on the side you got your standard
mounting holes standard mounting holes
on the other side you got your SATA
power and that is a SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second data interface back there so
