Media Group to be here at CES 2016
covering the show so with all the cool
stuff in the Samsung booth whether it's
the gigantic TV display at the front or
the you know fancy new design of their
gear SmartWatch why the crap Linus are
you standing in front of an appliance
something you don't even cover on your
channel well let me tell you this
appliance is like it's more machine now
than it is man it's twisted and well
there's nothing evil about it it was
always a machine but the point is that
they've actually taken something that we
do normally care about tablets and
they've kind of glued them into the
front of a fridge in a way that's
actually starting to get to the point
where it's becoming functional and
sensible so on the inside oh they don't
let you open it look at that I can move
the whole display but I cannot actually
open it so they thought of that before
they let me come in here so on the
inside it's just your standard fridge
you put things in there they get cold
then they stay cold but on the outside
they've done away with the magnets and
the sticky notes paradigm now I think
you probably could still put a sticky
note on it so we got grandpa's corner
over here and then for everyone else
we've got this 21 and a half inch Tizen
operating system based effectively like
a tablet built into the door that lets
you do a number of things but the one
that really blew me away is actually
what was on here already and I sincerely
hope that there's a way for me to get
back to it and that is the way that you
can use the cameras that are installed
inside the TV to actually show you
images of what is inside the TV you can
set things like expiry dates you can go
okay yeah this cake well this is cake
there you go and you know what it yeah
it was kind of like gross in the first
place so I'm not gonna eat that past
three days boom you've gone ahead and
set an expiry date for it and this is
really cool in addition to doing all of
this manually while you're standing in
front of it there's integration through
an app to allow you to view the camera
when you're out and about on your
smartphone so this
is the kind of thing I run into all the
time because I cook very infrequently so
I'll finally be like oh I should really
make dinner tonight and I'm at the
grocery store I'm like okay do I have
tomatoes do I have celery do I have to
have anything what do I have so I'll be
able to actually see a live view of
what's inside my fridge now I don't know
how great the cameras look will I be
able to tell if the celery's wilted or
not maybe not at this point but this
kind of technology a couple generations
down the line is going to be absolutely
freaking awesome and then the other big
one is the ability to shop through this
screen right here on your TV now I have
no idea when and if this is coming to
Canada so it's probably a long way wait
for me cuz nothing ever comes to Canada
but for everyone who lives in the first
world enjoy because that's going to be
freaking awesome to have a refrigerator
that's like yeah your eggs are about to
expire I'm order up some new eggs for
you so can have your omelet so thanks
