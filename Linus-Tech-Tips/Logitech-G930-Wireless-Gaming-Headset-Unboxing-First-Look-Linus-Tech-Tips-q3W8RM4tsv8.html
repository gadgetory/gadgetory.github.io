these are the logitech g930 gaming
headphones headsets whatever it is you
want them to be they're wireless and
they are in 7.1 Dolby surround sound so
we're going to go ahead and take a
closer look at the back of the box here
which basically tells us everything that
we need to know I suppose gaming grade
Wireless so they're claiming with a
range of up to 40 feet or 12 meters so
nothing stands between you and victory
sounds good 7.1 surround sound guys I am
NOT a huge I'm not a huge advocate of
the necessity of surround sound sort of
technologies for gaming I've always
taken sort of a well you've got two
years so you probably only need two
inputs sort of philosophy however if you
do enjoy the surround sound experience
one thing I will tell you is use a
digital surround sound headphone or
headset do not use one with dedicated
speakers and this again sort of comes
back to the whole if you have two ears
you probably only need two speakers
argument but when you when you put more
speakers into a small area like
headphones would have you do what
happens is you end up with a lot of
lower quality lower sound fidelity
speakers as opposed to to much larger
much better ones there's a reason that
every high-end you know gaming headphone
wants to tell you how big the drivers
are and the reason for that is because
bigger drivers basically will equal you
know a better overall ability to produce
noises more better so lots of smaller
speakers is not the solution free
programmable G Keys allows you to take
command over music well what they really
allow you to do is do whatever you want
you can program them so you can set up
voice morphing launch chat clients or
whatever else memory phone line
headbands should be good noise
cancelling microphone okay Oh
lows red one needed an automatically
mutes when rotated out of the way this
is a feature we see on a lot of headsets
these days
full speed USB charging base which
recharges even while you're still
playing and powers the wireless adapter
with a single you
the connection so let's go ahead and put
that away because we're pretty much done
with it now and open up the headset
itself so it comes in a little plastic
clamshell looks a little something like
this comes with a base station I'm
actually going to switch to our wider
cam for just a second here so that you
guys can see what the heck I'm doing
there are the g9 30s so right g-series
that basically means optimized for
gaming I'm going to go ahead and throw
these on my head for now while I get
some idea what I think of them in terms
of the comfort not bad actually the foam
is a little bit stiffer than I'm used to
encountering let's have a look at what
is included in terms of accessories so
inside this grate here love the way
Logitech does their packaging although
they still include CDs totally pointless
you can go ahead and download the latest
drivers off of the Logitech website
getting started with Premiere util easy
sell logitech wireless gaming headset
g930 it's going to go ahead and point
you in the direction of all the buttons
that you need to press or we're not
press let's see if any of them were
labeled do not press no power buttons
rounds on switch let's go ahead and
leave that open and of life battery
disposal notice okay cool that's good to
let you know about safety compliance and
warranty excellent so here's that base
station so this guy goes ahead and plugs
into your computer you can see it
actually coils up like this okay so if
anyone says they're going to drop a
coiler on your desk you better hope
they're referring to this thing I'm
getting a look from the filming crew
that would indicate that that joke is
not very funny but it's okay Diezel says
my joke stunk so wow this thing is
really difficult to uncoil although you
know getting your hands in it probably
isn't helping matters at all there you
go okay so there so there's a little hub
thing so you can go ahead and plug this
guy into here so that's the wireless
transmitter receiver you go ahead and
plug that into any USB port and then
this right here plugs into the back of
your computer so this will act as kind
of a hub so this will provide power to
the headphones / headset themselves
this will provide signal and power to
the dongle and then this plugs into
computer so I don't know that this is
necessarily the most elegant solution
ever in terms of sort of how they've
implemented this although it's not the
worst I probably would have personally
gone with just two separate cables
although I guess since it uses it looks
like it uses a standard micro USB you
could yeah it just uses a standard micro
USB see you could go that route if you
wanted to as well
it does have little rubber grips on the
bottom so if you wanted to make sure
that it doesn't move on your table then
you wouldn't really have any issues with
that there you go that pretty much takes
care of that moving on to the headset
itself so as I mentioned before once you
rotate it up and out of the way it will
mute itself it also glows red for mute
let's take a closer look and see what we
think into oh I probably just adjusted
my voice volume because these are they
are closed so they are somewhat noise
isolating I was not able to hear myself
very well while I had them on so here we
go three programmable G keys these guys
right here are allow you to change your
voice effects or do whatever else you
want like a G ha ha no I'm getting the
head shakes again not a good joke
apparently here's your mute button right
here if you did want to mute it manually
even though the boom mic is lowered you
can adjust the position of the boom
Michael though not as much as we've seen
on other headsets in the past okay so
there's your microphone there as well as
your noise-cancelling doodad right here
just to make sure that it's only picking
up your voice and not anything else I
mean it's not that bad but yeah I would
mind seeing something with a little bit
more vertical play
there's your volume right there do like
to see the volume wheel it's the most
comfortable sort of volume adjustment
method for me personally I don't really
like tactile buttons for volume I like
to have a nice wheel that I can go no
too loud and sort of quickly reduce like
that there's your power input remember
guys that'll charge the batteries as
well as just allow you to use the
headset as a wired headset should you so
desire
here's your Dolby headphone button nice
to have a dedicated button for this that
way you can just kind of decide on the
fly if this particular game or this
particular movie or song or whatever
sounds better to you in one mode versus
the other power buttons right here so
you can go ahead and press that button
and the light will this is probably in
pairing mode right now so it's probably
why it's flashing on the other side we
don't find much in terms of buttons or
anything so it's just a speed
in there and none of the electronics are
being housed like that so in terms of
rotation they go almost they go about 90
degrees away from centered from to this
side and then just about looks like only
about 15 20 degrees away from centered
the other side so that gives you about
as much adjustment as any sort of human
will need however if they are intended
to be used by nonhumans human humanoid
humanoids hominids nonhumans then they
probably need greater adjustment but
this should be just fine I think I did
say before that the foam feels a little
bit stiff I'd expect it to break in
there's memory foam in the top but it's
not the softest memory foam that I've
ever felt in the past yeah I'll give you
guys a closer look at that actually so
I'll just kind of squeeze it and show
you guys I guess it does take a while to
retract I just wouldn't mind if it was a
little bit thicker and then the ear cups
themselves I think they specifically
call out the memory foam in the top band
because I don't think it is memory foam
here this actually see you can see that
retracts extremely quickly so I would
expect there to be a bit of a break-in
period with this headset before it would
be a hundred percent comfortable which
isn't necessarily a shot at it's not
necessarily a mark against did I mean
even my HD 5 v 5s or not nearly as
comfortable at the beginning as they
were after using them for you know six
months but I think that pretty much
covers it have we missed anything here
folks oh yeah right adjustments so
adjustments are pretty I'll look at that
they're numbered that's adorable so
they're numbered from 1 to 11 so that if
you you know pay attention and you want
to know exactly which one you you you
prefer you can go ahead and get it sized
for yourself correctly and then you can
always get it back to the right thing if
you want they are it's a metal band
which is nice to see I've seen too many
plastic ear headband adjustments and
they just break or they they'd start to
not they'd start to not click into place
over time so I do prefer to see metal
construction there especially if it's
the kind of thing where you know gamers
they lose and then they're like oh and
they throw their headset off and disgust
I can pretty much guarantee that that
headset did survive the fall and that
market is disgusting diesel stop looking
at that let's come back up here I'm just
going to change camera away from him so
there you have it guys thank you for
checking out my unboxing you first look
