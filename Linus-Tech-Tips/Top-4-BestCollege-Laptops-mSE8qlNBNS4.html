whole thing went down some execs at Best
Buy we're sitting around going how can
we help students get geared up with the
hashtag best college yes in my
imagination executives speak in hashtags
laptops this year and some bold soul
stood up and said let's have Linus give
them the lowdown and that's what they
did
welcome to my top four laptops her
back-to-school showdown
drop a like on the video if you're one
of the 30,000 or so people who have been
asking me to do one of these roundups
for so long that you've actually
graduated with your post-secondary
degree already
now I'm gonna start by explaining a
little something-something I don't
really do the traditional top five or in
this case top four thing where you rank
a bunch of products from worst to best
when it comes to stuff that I'm
suggesting that you buy the only thing
that you should buy is the best thing
for your needs let's see how many people
can guess where you can get all this
stuff I'm talking about hey
so why list four things to buy that
aren't the best no instead I'll be
tackling four different use cases and
choosing one model that I personally
picked out as a great choice let's start
with number four for the ultimate bang
for the buck shopper
I'm calling this category super basic
this is actually my first time hands-on
with an HP stream device and I gotta say
while the 1366 by 768 TN screen takes me
back to my college days and it doesn't
feature the you know finest
craftsmanship with it
Egyptian cotton key cap covers or
whatever the build quality is certainly
not as bad as some laptops that I've
seen for twice the price and for two
hundred and eighty bucks you are getting
a surprising amount of computer but when
I picked out has a 13.3 inch display a
Celeron and 2840 processor two gigs of
ram and 32 gigs of on-board solid-state
storage and yeah those aren't amazing
specs or anything but for 280 bucks you
also get a free year of office 365 $100
value so instead of spending twice as
much on a machine that doesn't have the
office bonus and hoping it'll last you
effectively three times as long for the
price you could just buy new ones every
year taking advantage of the rapid pace
at which modern technology evolves and
then passing the hand-me-downs to a
sibling friend or fellow student which
isn't to say that buying something a
little nicer won't yield some extra
creature comforts if you don't mind
keeping your devices for a little longer
number three weighing in at a very
reasonable $900 is the Lenovo yoga 3
build quality gets a very significant
upgrade with that sick 360 degree hinge
design that is the calling card of
lenovo's premium yoga lineup and there
are some
very healthy spec upgrades as well a 5th
gen core i5 processor means more
performance without sacrificing battery
life 8 gigs of ram means more than 3
chrome tabs at a time some more like 6
haha
storage increases to 256 gigs of
solid-state storage that's eight times
the capacity of our bang for the buck
machine not to mention that it's a lot
faster and the display gets a nice
upgrade to a 1080p IPS panel which is
way better for content consumption
especially if you want to sit next to a
friend while watching a movie thanks to
its more vibrant colors and better
viewing angles for screen size I stuck
with 14-inch because from my experience
as someone who legitimately carries a
laptop in a backpack every day I find 13
to 14 inches is the sweet spot for carry
ability if you don't really need the
larger display which I guess leads us
really nicely into number 2 the first of
our more premium options and the size
ge62 Apache Pro well there are a lot of
gaming laptops out there for folks who
want to do more than just study few of
them strike the balance between size
weight horsepower and cost that the ge62
is found it's big enough to handle
cooling the core i7 quad core inside but
not so large that it's horrible to carry
like MSI's bulkier gt72 it's got 16 gigs
of ram for great multitasking
performance and it uses a dedicated 128
gigabyte SSD for the operating system
with one terabyte of hard drive space
for bulky files and games a less
convenient but higher performance
approach to hybrid storage now to be
clear there are gaming laptops out there
that are less expensive and also feature
quad core processors this is Zeus model
would be a great one to check out if you
want a powerful CPU in a reasonable size
machine that could pull double duty as a
portable workstation but for me to truly
consider something to be a gaming laptop
I need to see a gtx 970m so that's why I
went with a $1,500 option for the
all-rounder
Gaming box which speaking of expensive I
guess leads us pretty well into number
one a product whose inclusion in this
list will definitely leave some of you
scratching your heads after how much I
rained on its parade in my launch review
the Microsoft Surface pro 3 I picked out
a 4th gen core i5 dual core equipped
model with 8 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of
solid-state storage that set me back a
touch over $1200 although I count for a
bit extra because you're going to want
to use a tight cover accessory since
it's not too useful for typing without
that and the reason for it is that while
the surface pro 3 doesn't do much for my
personal daily workload thanks to its
easy to use stylus responsive
high-resolution touchscreen and flexible
form factor that allows it to really be
used as either a notebook or a notepad
thanks to the included OneNote software
that lets you take notes mark up
existing documents or pictures that you
take with the rear camera and sync
everything to the cloud as you work and
there's more good news if you don't want
to pony up that much for the pro model
unlike early step-down models like the
surface RT the third generation non pro
surface uses an Intel processor now for
a similar if not as powerful Windows 10
experience that the pro has so you get
that outstanding app compatibility which
I guess wraps up our list here so all
that's left is to give a big shout out
to Best Buy thanking them not just for
sending us the laptops that we asked to
check out for this roundup but also for
being really cool about it and not
trying to you know guide us to the
laptops that they wanted to sell leaving
us instead to pick whatever we wanted
off their site based on what we thought
was right for our viewers so thanks for
watching guys if this video sucked do
you know what to do but if it was
awesome get subscribed hit that like
button or even considered supporting us
directly by buying a cool t-shirt like
this one or with a direct monthly
contribution through our forum now that
you're done doing all that stuff you're
probably wondering what to watch next so
click that little button in the top
right corner to check out this video
where we took a GTX 480 to see how its
performance has evolved in the 5 years
since it launched within videos regular
driver updates so I'll see you there and
then I'll see
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
