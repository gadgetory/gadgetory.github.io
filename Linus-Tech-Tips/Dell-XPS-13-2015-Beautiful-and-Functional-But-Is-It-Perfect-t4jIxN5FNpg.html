reviewed from a pretty fresh and purely
objective perspective since they're not
really the kind of thing that I would
use as a daily driver anyway and perhaps
more importantly they don't have a
predecessor with whom I have a very
intimate relationship my Dell XPS 13
2015 Edition video will be different
it's daddy is clearly the last
generation XPS 13 whose name it bears
but for me it gets to go head-to-head
with its mama the 2013 XPS 12 for
Grandma I guess it's generational dur
than that a product whose two and one
transformation capabilities it doesn't
share but to which it otherwise bears a
more than passing resemblance the msi
gt80 titan is the world's first gaming
laptop with a fully mechanical keyboard
and features dual gtx 980m s in sli
click now to learn more so let's begin
with the highlight feature the 13 now
this laptop is available with a 1080p
non-touch display with standard glass
but I think most people would argue that
you're not really doing your XPS 13
right unless you opt for the premium
super high pixel density 3200 by 1800
IPs gelila glass-covered 10-point
multi-touch option that Dell is calling
infinity display and as much as that's a
silly meaningless marketing word man
it's beautiful and like the hyper thin
5.2 millimeter bezel allows the XPS 13
to actually be about an inch less in
width and height than my 12 and a half
inch XPS 12 while delivering a larger
display but of course size isn't
everything so you know what's it like
once you get it in your hands and start
working on it actually a little weird at
first to be honest I mean I'm accustom
to the screen kind of ending at the edge
of the keyboard on most laptops and on
this one it just kind of doesn't is
surprisingly different feeling but you
do get used to it quite quickly there
are still issues though text and UI
scaling still sucks in Windows 8.1 with
some applications displaying blurry text
and others UI is completely falling
part something I will keep mentioning
until it's addressed but the good news
is that in browsers and most of the
other things you'll normally use man is
this monitor gorgeous near-perfect
viewing angles retina like sharpness and
it's bright too color temperature was a
touch cool out of the box but around
with the color monkey fix that right up
and also told me that I'm sitting at
about forty percent brightness getting a
hundred and twenty Candela per meter
squared out of this thing's that's about
ideal for indoors at full brightness
it's basically blinding inside but great
if you happen to be out in the Sun but
of course if you just wanted to hear
about how great the screen is endlessly
then you could watch this ten-hour loop
we created me talking about how great it
is if you're not into that sort of thing
well then keep watching this video
because this parrot has a lot more
tricks up its wherever a pony would
store tricks the guts for all XPS 13 s
contain adele 1560 2x2 802.11 AC
wireless card a 52 watt hour battery
that Dell figures is good for up to 12
hours on the high res model and 15 on
the low res one and built in Intel HD
5500 graphics with depending on the trim
level some variety of you or ultra-low
power class dual core Core i3 i5 or i7
processor four to eight gigabytes of RAM
and anywhere from a 128 to 512 gigabyte
n dot 2 SSD little on a second there
Linus that SSD sounds like super cool
and fast at PCI Express but either I've
got like wax buildup in my ear you just
said this notebook has four gigs of RAM
on the thousand dollar model and a mere
eight gigs on the seventeen hundred and
fifty dollar model well you might have
enough wax in your ear to cause hearing
problems gross by the way but that
wasn't the issue just now Dells 2015 XPS
13 doesn't even have the option to
configure it with more RAM than I can
fill up with a single multi tabbed
internet browser hook there is more good
stuff though the material choices are
superb with a similar machined aluminum
and real carbon fiber black and silver
theme to the one that I have and loved
so much the whole device is
astonishingly slim yet even while run
the work benchmark that I used for
battery life testing in PC mark 8 the
fan stayed either very quiet and
sometimes didn't even spin and the i/o
has been dramatically improved for me
anyway by the addition of an SD card
reader to go with the USB 3 port and
lock on this side and the additional USB
3 port 4k capable mini DisplayPort port
power jack battery life indicator and
4-pole combo audio jack on the other but
I have more criticism - while the bottom
is a solid chunk of aluminum with only
vent holes and rubber feet to disrupt
its awesomeness and the screen itself is
phenomenally rigid considering how thin
and basically bezel Asit is the keyboard
has taken a significant backward step in
the build quality department the
backlight is nice and white and the
layout is pretty much ideal isn't it
slightly shorter than I'd like backspace
key
but the key travel distance is very
short the membrane switches have an
unsatisfying front-heavy and sudden
tactile bump and much more importantly
than any of that other stuff the entire
keyboard has way more flex than I'd
expect in a premium product like this
regardless of how thin and sexy it is
while I'm calling on I do have some
other gripes in no particular order
ad√®le the power adapter is super small
which is nice but your friction lock
power plug wore out on my old notebook
and basically falls out now on that one
I'm disappointed this hasn't been
revised your nonsense McAfee trial and
Dell update we're using 25 plus percent
CPU doing mortal he knows what when I
first booted the thing up at one point
I've since removed them both the
speakers are side firing rather than
front-facing which bites and there's a
bit of a lip on the bezel here that
makes swiping in from the right for the
charms menu kind of uncomfortable and
difficult ok that last one was pretty
petty which means we're probably heading
to the good stuff again the precision
track pads default medium delay for palm
rejection is horrible but once I changed
that I got used to it pretty quickly
there is something I can't quite put my
finger on
hahahaha what a joke but even now I'm
actually experiencing some kind of
cursor acceleration based tracking
annoyances with fine movements but I'm
pretty sure that's Windows fault so as
far as the hardware
concerned overall accuracy
responsiveness and the feel of this
glass pad with seamless clicky buttons
on the bottom is very very solid and so
is pretty much the rest of this device I
mean thanks to its 5th gen processor my
i-5 equipped model managed to score of
2846 in the PC mark work suite that I
ran as a battery life benchmark and to
see how far we've come in the last
couple of years well it did that while
managing 35% yes deep into double digits
more battery life than my old product
and speaking of battery life Dell
actually sent over this battery pack
thing which you can use to squeeze some
extra out of it and charge other stuff
like your phone while you're at it if
you're into that sort of thing so we
have come a long way but it's bottom
line time now and the bottom line is the
XPS 13 2015 Edition is a fantastic and
stunningly beautiful machine that I love
but that lacks the customizability on
Dells website that would allow me to
configure it into something that I would
buy the pre baked options make a lot of
trade-offs that sound great on paper
like giving up 20% of its rated battery
life for a fancy high pixel density
display in the premium models but in
practice are let down by the awful
experience that is using Windows with UI
scaling so Dell if you're listening I
love this device but here's the one that
I would want to see next time 1080p IPS
with a touch screen covered in Gorilla
Glass so that I can conserve some
battery and don't need to scale and 16
gigs of RAM seriously that's critical
and let me have whatever processor an
SSD that I want and whatever trim level
I want it seems like a lot of the
options are locked down kind of
unnecessarily I build tall order option
would be nice speaking of I don't know
something that I just said Valentine's
Day is fast approaching I know right and
