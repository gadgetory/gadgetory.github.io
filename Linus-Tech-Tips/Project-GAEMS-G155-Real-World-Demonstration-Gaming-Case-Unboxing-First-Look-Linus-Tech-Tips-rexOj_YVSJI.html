you ever have the desire to travel with
your xbox 360 or Playstation 3 slim you
can get one of these and you can game on
the go I am have it all packed up inside
here and ready to demo but I just want
to show you guys the outside of this
case I didn't unboxing already so you
can check that out if you want to see it
but we'll just sort of this is a Greek
app for the sake of anyone who hasn't
already watched that video so on the top
you've got your manufacturer logo which
is GA EMS I guess it's meant to be
pronounced to games like as in spelled
wrong that still would be pronounced
games okay so it's the g1 55 okay on
this side you find a clip which can have
a shoulder strap attached to it I mean
you look at things that could also have
a lock attached to it whichever you
prefer I don't think that's gonna work
as a shoulder strap let's go with lock
so you can lock the one side you can
lock the other side okay on the bottom
you find three rubber non-slip ii things
on the bottom you find more rubber
non-slip enos so whether you put it down
this way or whether you put it down this
way it shouldn't slip and it shouldn't
fall over now the unit was unstable and
I put it on the table in my unboxing but
see look look how stable it is now the
reason is that it's meant to have a game
console loaded in it in addition to the
LCD monitor that's already in there so
that's why was leaning to one side quite
easily when it didn't have a console
inside so I'm gonna go ahead and put
this down this is the game ever gonna
run on it right here
unclick both sides oh yeah good carrying
case so metal robust rubber here very
strong alright open this bad boy up and
inside we find our HD LCD monitor
including a power button volume control
brightness up brightness down menu and
two headphone jacks and HDMI input and a
power input this 2 headphone jacks thing
is critical because you're probably not
going to be playing with like four
players on something like this but it'd
be pretty cool if you were travelling
around
you had your your xbox 360 and you could
you know plug in one pair of headphones
to get your friend to plug in a pair of
headphones and then you could use the
two controllers that can be stored in
the little pouch on the side here so
I've got two Xbox 360 controllers there
you can also take out the power plugs
which I'm gonna go ahead and plug in so
I'll need to solve the one there and
then I'm gonna pull out the Xbox whoops
360 power brick go ahead and take that
around there so this is the setup that
you will have to do the reality of it is
you need to - power plugs and all that
in order to get the unit running so
hopefully you can live with that I'm
gonna have to unplug one of my lights in
here so hopefully it's not too bad is it
okay okay alright so that's what I had
stored in there now I wasn't able to
find any additional room for games but I
guess you could probably get away with
like one game here or something like
that but you can see how the Xbox 360 is
strapped in so this pad on the bottom
protects it it's very very soft you can
flip it over the other way for the ps3
slim or for the Xbox 360 slim and then
what you do is you take these straps
strap in your console and it is not
going anywhere so I have it plugged in
let's go ahead and power it on actually
not yet turn into this thing on before
and I hope I have batteries in my Xbox
360 controller I do alright okay give me
a sec here guys I'll wait for it to boot
up sorry about that guys okay so we have
the g1 55 gaming station I've got it all
set up and the Xbox 360 is booted up and
I also have a helium balloon so I'm
feeling pretty lightheaded right about
now oh that's better
okay so I just want to show you guys
basically how it works in terms of the
viewing angle in terms of any sort of
ghosting or motion blur that you're
gonna see on this particular screen so I
mean I think you pretty much got the
point here's something that it bears
noting now it's really hard to move
around once it's deployed because of the
rubber
things on the bottom which is good you
don't want it to just sort of randomly
move around but all your ventilation
holes at the back have ample room
between the back of the Xbox in the
screen your ventilation holes here are
not like I just do something well I just
injected the game lips are not too
obstructed by the straps and then the
ones on the bottom are also not that
obstructed so your Xbox 360 shouldn't
run into any more overheating problems
than normal when you're using the g1 55
now in terms of the speakers that were
equipped with here I guess I'd give me a
sec to get the game booted back up now
that I know that I broke it and then we
can we can listen to the speakers so
just a second so here's the viewing
angles you guys it is a TN panel so it's
not gonna be perfect by any stretch of
the imagination but I'm so far away at
this point that's at really
realistically you're not gonna be
playing with four people on something
like this so if you got two people
you're sitting at a reasonable distance
you got a kind of person one here it's
gonna look about like that and then you
got person one here and it's gonna look
about like that so that's pretty much
how it's gonna go down now in terms of
the volume let's go ahead and
crank this up I mean I don't want you
guys to have unrealistic expectations
okay we're probably not gonna crank that
all the way up because it's getting
pretty loud to be perfectly honest
so go ahead and start the game continued
story so here why don't I just I'll
leave this here and I'm gonna go ahead
and adjust the screen no apparently I
can't do that okay so what I could do is
I could put a game box here I can put
that there
so it is a glossy screen so you are
gonna get a little bit of reflectiveness
find it
and the other one there we are panda Han
gives you the ability to execute okay
whoops definitely use the Xbox much so
I'm not an expert is it loading right
now
sooner we get it to the Americans at the
airport thanks to them sooner we get
paid oh is that a guy any idea what's in
the big box early they didn't notice
that I've actually never played this
winter cell game
hey the jump oh here we go
left trigger the drum
okay well the general point of that was
that the speakers are pretty loud
definitely a satisfactory gaming
experience so thank you for checking out
my first look in gameplay video with the
g51 portable gaming station and I hope
you enjoyed it don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips for more unboxings
reviews and other computer videos you
know what just to give you guys some
idea it looks better in person than it
looks on the camera there's a lot of
reflectiveness of the cameras catching
and then you really can't see in person
I'd say this zone kind of right here is
representative of how the screen
actually looks because of that light
behind me it looks fine yeah it's just
the lenses having it the heart cameras
can do a hard time adjusting to the the
backlit screen so I'd say the color is
sort of more like this than like this at
all this is this is more like it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
