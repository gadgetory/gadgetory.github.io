brought to you by NCI XCOM your source
for great technology selection and
service along with Corsair memory and
Western Digital so we're at the sapphire
suite well they didn't have anything
necessarily new for me they showed me
the r9 290 with its Triax cooler on
there that was released a little bit
before Christmas and now I haven't seen
this in real life yet and it's actually
really exciting compared to a reference
card it's got a beastly cooler with five
really big copper heat pipes running
through it three in one direction two in
the other direction which should help
cool it a lot and it does under load
this card floats at around 70 something
degrees in comparison to a stock card
that floats at 95 this will allow you to
do a lot more with it and it kind of
removes that scary feeling that your
cards sitting at almost 100 degrees
which is just kind of unsettling and I
noticed a lot of people don't like that
I've even seen some people not
overclocking they're too 90s at all just
because of how hot they go you don't
have to worry about that with the Triax
card another reason why I wanted to come
to sapphire was just to talk about their
tricks software we did a water cooling
update for 290 not that long ago where I
couldn't really overclock it that much
because I didn't have any power to play
with now with their offsetting controls
in tricks which they updated fairly
recently you can actually control
offsets and overclock much more so I'm
excited to test that in the future thank
you for watching our Sapphire content no
matter how short it was if you liked all
