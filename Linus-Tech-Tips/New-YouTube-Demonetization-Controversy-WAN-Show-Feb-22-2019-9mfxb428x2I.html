another spectacular wine show another
has there ever been a spectacular Rancho
well another if you liked previous wine
shows then this is pretty much more of
the same there's been some pretty
spectacular ranches I think there's been
some pretty spectacular shows we've got
a bunch of great topics for you guys
today including the big controversy
where YouTube is deem monetizing
channels over the comments that other
users post under their videos more on
this at 11:00 I love it I'm so happy I'm
just it's so great there's also Samsung
Galaxy fold yeah I want to spend
considerably more than I spent on my
first car on a phone there's Apple 2019
leaks and more yeah there we go
why don't we do the intro for a change
sure goodness oh that was so good
and remember kids you can't say
demonetised
without that's that's not my doing it's
from I Ain't mistaken
should hire this dude or dudette as a
writer around here oh wait yes Oh
savages your sponsor today my jerky is
there a loose spice ropes I just want to
do it now yes oh I actually had some of
the the ghost pepper hot sauce with my
pastelon hot sauce and pasta you down
I'm talking like red sauce pasta like
meat sauce I haven't had it before it
seems like it would go really well
though it makes sense well cover well
cover the sponsor supposed to go so I
actually had our really cool week we did
some really neat videos this week I'd
love to tell you about them but I no
longer you know what let's talk about
this first I no longer do the win show
on my daily driver laptop
yeah because some of you may or may not
have noticed this but over the last few
weeks there have been a couple of land
shows that mysteriously went missing and
they they were either just not uploaded
immediately after we broadcast or they
were they were live for a short period
of time and then and then gone what's
weird is YouTube just glitched it so no
great that makes sense wait that doesn't
actually make sense no that doesn't make
sense
did our site YouTube froze for a second
let me just I have actually note this
computer is probably long overdue for a
reboot if nothing else so I don't know
well it seems fine now anyway a couple
of wine shows disappeared and the reason
for that was not contrary to some fairly
aluminum foil hat type speculations
things
yeah lammed that down because that was
not it nothing to do with Fox no nothing
to do with Google Google did not pull
down the land show um and nothing to do
with me trying to suppress information
that I had said on the land show about
like the whole Content ID claim thing
that went on nothing like that what
actually happened was there was some
personal information of mine that was
leaked in one of them and then there was
some personal information of some of our
staff that was leaked in another one so
in order to ensure that I don't have
spreadsheets or banging that works super
well open on my laptop I have gotten a
different one however it's not a perfect
fix because actually one of those times
I was already using this one but I was
signed in to Chrome which like which
carries a lot of personal information
with it
things are hard okay yeah um I never
claimed to be some kind of tech guru
they put me on that pedestal no you did
no I didn't you named the channel I your
names in it in tech tips I didn't name
the channel actually those are boss
that's my defense we didn't exactly
fight against it though I'm sure I named
the NCIX channel which I hosted yes tech
tips so I met I am partially responsible
[Laughter]
man yeah so what was I talking about
I don't you attend with your laptop but
I brought entirely sure why IIIi don't
remember why I actually had died I have
no oh oh oh oh LTX okay remember I told
you there was an update yeah okay so
Colton because he is a small small man
physically has has like he's just look
he's power tripping right now he's power
Trinity okay he has put a gag order on
me he's put a gag order on me he said
that I can't tell people how many LTX
tickets have sold already
oh so we did a stream a few
hours ago announcing that LTX tickets
are on sale
I wish the stream had been on time
because by the time we did the stream
VIP tickets had been sold out for over
an hour
I had comments of people telling me that
they tried to buy them but by the time
they got through the capture they were
gone and they had like BOTS watching the
site that's what I was saying like
previously I was like I think that like
a price might be a little too low
because like people are gonna grab them
too fast but then you feel bad if you
put it too high I totally understand do
you know how much of an asshole
I already feel like charging people
hundreds of dollars to come hang with me
in the team like that feels
inappropriate no I know but the only way
for us to slow down the velocity of
those tickets would be to charge like
two three grand for them yeah but it's
like but then that's that's ridiculous
the same yeah and then you're you're
making it so a lot of the people that
should probably be the ones that are
there exactly I'm not able to get this
there's no way to make everyone happy
unless I set aside like three months
yeah and do you want to know not even
like legitly wouldn't be enough time so
I can give you guys so I can't tell you
how many tickets have sold but what I
can do
reappears on them I can I can write it
on my dock here and then Luke can react
to the number is it I can't
I can't even compare it all no you can't
because compared to people I know people
know how many tickets we've sold in
previous years yeah and like they would
be able to do that how many are there
available maximum so it's a little fuzzy
it will depend on the final layout
because the fire marshal is going to
look at the layout and say in spruce
here's how many you're allowed to have
but the absolute maximum of that space
assuming we put nothing in it is six
thousand go buy your tickets yeah yeah
[Laughter]
that's crazy
I wonder like I'm sure part of its
Dreamhack but I wonder if it's a pretty
significant amount it's just the tone
cuz like this year's gonna be way
different all the office tours are sold
so the entire prior Friday I'm taking
groups if I think it's twenty or twenty
five on tours every I think it's half an
hour or forty minutes
and so that's however many I think
that's like ten tours all of those are
gone Jaden and we'll cuz you'll be here
by then you guys got to be in office
that day so flip Lincoln like a show up
yeah flow plane has to like flex hard
right yeah I'm allowed to make sure
people Joe McCoy wasn't short gain what
no he wasn't
well he wasn't tall he wasn't short hold
on a minute here he was super he was not
yeah he was not short those a fabricated
thing anyway five foot seven he's like I
need to tell her than me but that's back
then yeah that's true okay yeah
apparently yes I know the number
oh so that's pretty sick I don't I can't
I want to give comparatives but I can't
you just say
we did we can say that you weren't gonna
let me say that okay all right so in the
last in the last okay here's here's what
I'll say in the first two hours we sold
more tickets than we did last year all
together and it's not like it stopped
dead after two hours that should give
you some idea yeah so yeah I'm so stoked
I am like so excited it is going to be
just like and that the crazy thing is
even if we were to sell every ticket
that we could it's still borderline
whether we would even break even yeah
yeah but like if the idea was let's have
a crazy get-together of like tech
enthusiasts and tech creators and have
like a giant two-day just like fun event
then well if more people show up then
that's cool I'm really excited that's
really cool that legitimizes a lot of it
your first day of ticket sales like I
know being a buyer you're like ah
whatever I kind of want to buy last
minute so I can make sure I do my hotel
whatever whatever like my mom needs me
to help her move something and I can go
do that that day instead yeah but as a
ticket as the person selling the tickets
you want to sell them all really quickly
because then you know that there's a lot
of demand and then you can scale up next
year and all that kind of stuff so it's
nice that you buy tickets now also if
you want to go apparently
you might have to buy them now people
are saying maybe AMD can sponsor more
space no actually you're done I checked
in with Colton even like a couple weeks
ago because I've seen how much hype
there is about the event this year and I
was like hey so Convention Center do
they have more space he's like no look
you could stop asking me there we have
like the whole like okay if we were
doing this again next year we want to
scale up in that same building yes there
is okay yes
like if we
ich LTX 2019 the next day were like yo
Vancouver Convention Center
same bat-time same bat-channel next year
we need double the space like they've
got it okay they have multiple buildings
even yeah so we're just in like cuz it's
cool to be able to scale in the same
building for a while I think we're in
like three ballrooms of one building
right now it's like a massive space but
like there's room that's legit is really
close we could go for it very cool on
the topic of things exciting I'm excited
to have something controversial as a
headline even though I personally hmm
don't necessarily think this is a huge
deal I think it's great okay
so it's wonderful I'm reloading on the
forum posted fantastic basically what's
happening right now is use your comments
on your video could get your video
demonetised so a report from Wired on
Wednesday claimed that videos of okay
children in their underwear or showing
their exposed buttocks and genitals are
racking up millions of views on YouTube
with the site displaying advertising for
major cosmetics and car brands alongside
the content now to be clear and you know
it's such a weird thing to talk about
like I take pictures of my kids where
their butts showing all your size stuff
on the wall at my parents house of me
I've seen this yeah and it's Lord in
normal if it's not perverse yeah like
like I like I like I bathe these
children like it to me there's nothing
there's nothing sexual about it they're
just my kids being a cute little kids
that's sometimes they happen to be naked
and they're adorable
and so with that said I don't I don't
upload them you don't share them yeah so
my photo back
solution is one on a private server that
I own it's actually something I didn't
realize when I first set up a plex
server is how great it is for photo
library backup because not only can I
check out my photos but I can see my
wife's and before you ask yes
to a thing yes anyway it's important yep
um and Plex is quite great so it's kind
of amazing I'm down with that
anyway so so the thing is the people
uploading this content might just be
uploading haha a funny video of when the
dog like pulled on juniors pants and his
butt was showing but there's comments
under scenes of these videos where
exposed things can be seen like we're
like where a child does the splits like
in a say a gymnastics video for example
or lifts up their top showing their
nipples
um the moment ice that appears your
family dollars like pedophiles who are
documenting these timestamps for each
other to find Wow and then effectively
create what they've effectively created
is like a softcore child pornography
like loop or ring yeah so right back to
the part about how these videos are
monetized in some cases by big brands
now obviously if I'm pampers I don't
think there's anything particularly
inappropriate about the buttocks of a
baby no it's literally my job to make
things that go against them and keep
them dry and velvety soft or whatever
yeah right and pampers was just an
arbitrary example I actually have no
idea who even which multi-national
conglomerate owns the pampers brand I
just hypothetical example no idea but
when all of a sudden it's being twisted
and deformed into something that is
being whether it was intended for it or
not used
pedophile wank material all of us well
no seriously like do I want my brand on
it
No so on Wednesday YouTube announced
that it had banned more than 400
channels and disabled comments on tens
of millions of videos so some of the
demonetised videos are from perfectly
innocent creators so source for here is
here we go let's go ahead and pull this
up
Jessica Bollinger my five-year-old son
does div gnostics is a happy sweet
confident boy YouTube's not advertiser
friendly I find the timing of this very
disheartening for the YouTube community
and apparently a lot of people agree
YouTube's posted an updated Labadie
bloobity blah blah blah um so when I
preface this I said that I didn't think
it was that big of a deal do you want to
go first or should I explain that
probably quite controversial stance no
you can go for it okay I could I have
stuff to say but you can go for it if
you want okay so one I fully understand
why brands would be hypersensitive to
being associated with anything that is
not just illegal but disgusting like
pedophilia and in the outrage culture of
today for them to imagine that their
brand appearing next to this with those
comments under it might turn off some
people or spark just widespread fear er
is not necessarily unreasonable I posted
a tweet earlier this week of me holding
up an accessory for the Xbox I believe
it's called the accessible controller
nothing super cool so we're actually
working on a review which is why we have
it oh so anyway I I held up a picture
poking fun at this accessory because
they reused
molding from the Nintendo nunchuck and I
went good job Microsoft you invented the
Wii Nunchuk because it's got like a
giant Xbox logo and stuff people were so
mad they were like how dare you make fun
of disabled gamers what and I went what
are you talking about
I'm making fun of them reusing plastic
molding it's a cost-saving measure like
it was a purely purely technical joke
not look you gotta figure out who the
real enemy is here so that's that's yeah
that's what is the problem yes you got
to figure out who's on your side okay so
this comes back to oh man I'm gonna
attend it now so this comes back to the
whole tampons versus pads controversy
with the Amazon goes to our video I shot
an intro of that video where the actual
joke is that you're a moron if you feel
like feminine hygiene products are too
icky to go get them for your significant
that's the joke but I I but I say it in
a way that is sort of intended not to
offend people too much I guess
like I beat around the bush a little bit
so I basically go you know if you are if
you are if there's a feminine hygiene
emergency in your house and you are too
embarrassed to talk to a real live human
being while you go buy these things well
then great news for you there's the
Amazon ghost story I'm poking fun at the
idea that we are so fresh we are so
fragile and we are so desperate to avoid
any kind of human contact whatsoever
that we need a store with no cashiers so
we can buy pads that's the joke but
people are mad at me cuz they're like
you are normalizing the like because
there's honestok view that females are
gross
kurodo the enemy is so back to this back
to this accessory the actual backstory
here is that I had to go buy this bloody
thing including the the controller
because Microsoft isn't seating them for
whatever reason I was like okay fine you
know what forget it this is such an
important product to cover which we've
actually talked about in the past - but
what fine we're just we're gonna we're
just gonna buy it
so that we can try it because people
need to know about this because it's
super cool so I post one tweet teasing
them about reusing plastic molding and
it's like now I hate disabled gamers or
something I saw the commercial for it
watching the Super Bowl with my family
and I went on a rant about how cool it
is that they made it and how it's like
not a prophet play but it's like really
cool because it could really enable
different people to be able to play
these games more effectively than they
could already super super cool product
so so yeah what I was basically going to
say was that it's not fair to take down
a whole bunch of these channels where
it's clear I did have one more point go
for it okay sorry yeah yeah thing there
no I'm good
that's fine so point number two is that
in the case of any one of these videos
where the subject matter is minors
there's a really really gray legal area
around monetization of YouTube videos
containing minors so on the one hand I
could say you know what any video that I
shoot with my son I am his parent or
guardian it's my video i I'm monetizing
it that's you know what I'm gonna spend
some of that money on stuff for him what
is it there's like no there's a clause
specifically for this it's named after
someone who so I pay my kids whenever
they had Joe in our videos yeah because
I think there is going to be a huge poop
shell especially when with a lot of the
family vlogger channels where these kids
who were minors
not under the protections and the
stipulations of how miners in the film
industry are supposed to be treated
where these miners are gonna grow into
adults and they're gonna say hey like
some of the big channels there's
literally millions of dollars at play
over the course of all the years they've
been running hey where's my check and no
the roof over my head and the food in my
tummy
is not payment so to me monetizing
content with a miner who you are let's
face it probably not paying you're not
paying little Johnny for the ice skating
video that you're posting on YouTube and
you know what there's probably not a ton
of money involved in it but as soon as
there's any there's potentially a
problem here so we're looking at content
where miners are potentially without
fully understanding the ramifications of
being present on social media where
miners are being monetized um I guess
what I'm trying to say is yeah so
there's a law I knew about this the
Coogan law I knew yes it was named after
someone was enacted to protect the
earnings of child actors this is
different because it's for movies where
that child actor is paid and then the
parents take the money it's different is
it it's different right now but it's
probably going to end up covering the
same stuff and what you're doing is
probably quite logical so I guess yeah I
guess we're just in I guess we're just
in a bit of an interesting situation
it'll happen to someone I don't think
necessarily that it is that it makes
sense for people to unless they're doing
everything by the book and employing
their children as actors I don't think
it makes sense for them to be monetizing
this type of content so I guess YouTube
and I'm I am speculating I've not spoken
to anyone at YouTube about this but I
guess YouTube is looking at this going
ok we have a problem with our
advertisers
they don't like their ads on anything
that could be perceived as pedophilia
okay we have problem number two our own
perception we don't want YouTube to be
perceived as profiting off of pedophilia
and child pornography however softcore
it may be and problem number three is
that this has the potential to freakin
blow up at some point anyway
is this even really right I think it's a
distant third to be very clear because
YouTube has a lot of stuff on it that I
kind of go yeah is that really right
yeah but there's there's my argument
there's my argument for why I actually
don't think they made a bad move here
sorry I will let you go now I realize I
talked for a very long time
no that's fine I think as long as you I
think that's all super valid especially
the part about the child actors it's not
the same technically but I think it's
it's going to go poorly at some point in
time like I was saying someone is going
to be the the main host of a YouTube
channel who's a child and then they're
gonna grow up and be like where's all my
money and those videos are still gonna
be monetized and they're still not gonna
be making money off of it and there's
gonna be some new law or an attendant to
the coogan law or whatever it's like
legally a minor cannot actually
absolutely recently that a minor could
even create a Google account so I pretty
much guarantee you most of the Google
accounts there for the YouTube channels
that are run by kids are owned by their
parents yeah that makes you their
employer anyway sorry yeah so like that
that's gonna have to be handled somehow
and that's its own entire problem I
don't think it's completely fair in in
the like okay we get to a problem where
Google isn't the government so like it
doesn't matter if it's fair or not it
doesn't matter at all if it's fair or
not they're a private company they can
do whatever the heck they want so
whatever but if we were looking at it
that way which is not fair to Google or
YouTube but it's it's I don't think it's
entirely fair to to take these channels
down or D monetize them when it is the
complete opposite of the intention of
the channel it's not their fault some
weird person on the internet likes it
and maybe those people should look into
to say blink on comments or like that
lady actually said in her chain of
tweets
she's very militant about like cleansing
her comment section so she's probably
already kind of taking care of it I just
have a question if all you're doing is
removing the comments are you solving
the problem you solve the problem of
that like network thing you're talking
about because I'm assuming what the idea
is they were going to someone's channel
that doesn't have videos and can you
still search up work because someone
comments on things not sure I don't know
you used to be able to go to someone's
page on YouTube even if they didn't
upload any videos and you could see
their comments across the whole site and
I'm assuming they have like central
accounts and they go to those and they
see all the timestamps on all the
different videos so if you shut off
comments and you shut that off or just
make it so you can't see a single
accounts comments across the site
because what's really the mechanism of
that other than but you could spoil
someone you could still consolidate all
this information off-site somewhere else
and click on time-stamped youtube links
yeah that's true dojin asks so instead
of the video making money for the
creator google this makes the money no
they're pulling the advertising off them
entirely yeah so Google's not making
money at all I mean I guess what I'm
more meant was like if you're if you're
a concerned parent seeing these comments
on and I'm not I'm not I'm not judging
everyone's in their own situation I
don't know what kind of comments we're
moderated but if you're a concerned
parent seeing comments where pedophiles
are watching the content wouldn't the
actual course of action yourself pull it
down yourself or to cut out or censor or
bladder horns that are making people so
excited she was saying that her son does
gymnastics so maybe there's parts where
his shirt comes up or something maybe
work on getting him some clothes that
doesn't do that or cut out the parts
where that happens but I don't think
that all children doing any form of
gymnastics should be universally banned
across the entire internet like that
seems a little aggressive
yeah that's madness yeah there needs to
be some type of like need to be able to
do athletic things as a child and like
have it be okay because that's
ridiculous
but as a parent I think it's reasonable
to cut out parts where there's clothing
malfunctions or to just get some clothes
that don't do that that's very possible
so part of the issue this is a great
comment from YouTube URLs on forum all
right use me floatplane one of the
issues was that because the comments
were so self referential and had so many
cross links between them once you
watched a couple of these videos your
entire recommended would be filled with
more of them which was how it was so
easy to find a bunch of this type of
material
so yes moderating your comments how are
they sold would help bridge that like
because they have so many of the same
keywords and stuff so they become
tightly associated so they would like
put in a bunch of keywords and then a
timestamp so the algorithm was was
figuring well they were like discussing
like oh at this point there's a nipple
slip and stuff like the comments are
really explicit they're not just a
timestamp I thought it was supposed to
be sneaky I thought it was just
timestamps that's that's how was that
not picked up that seems like the
easiest thing if if literally the
algorithm can find like comments in
order to suggest them to you couldn't
they just have used that to remove the
cons and banning accounts seems pretty
straightforward you've already got it
working for similar you you literally
are able to detect similar comments and
suggest those videos like it doesn't
seem like a difficult next step anyway
so I I don't like the idea of just
purging all those types of videos I do
like the idea of parents making sure
they're they're cleansed videos and
maybe give your kids some better clothes
for gymnastics
well the gymnastics thing to like it
could just be that it's very tight
fitting clothes yeah and a lot of like
the thing is a lot of sports attire is
kind of revealing I mean look at like
tennis attire for example almost any
sports attire hockey football pants yeah
football pants they do not leave a lot
to the imagination though you're behind
the center you know what though that
butt looks like hey buddy
yeah but like yeah I don't I don't I
don't think that should mean that you
can never have a video of boys football
there are plenty of videos of my brother
and I playing football when we were
children I don't think any of those are
not okay so it's a complicated issue
YouTube's general policy for this type
of stuff is to lay the SmackDown and
then let it back a little and then dial
it back slowly so that's probably what
they're doing yeah there's always
collateral damage and there's always Pat
bad PR to go along with it in this case
I don't necessarily fundamentally
disagree with what they're doing but
yeah what it is I guess like and I mean
you know the thing too is like that's
easy for me to say but what if what if
the only thing paying for those
gymnastics lessons was the monetization
on these videos like everyone's
situation is really really different in
their lives and that's something that we
also have to consider yeah one thing we
know for sure is that floatplane
yeah wouldn't be pulling content down
yeah slightly more of a walled garden
because people would have to pay to
access that content also your comment
section is going to be much smaller and
filled with better people so you
probably wouldn't have these types of
situations in general anyways
and and yeah he just wouldn't make a ton
of sense that's great it's great for us
isn't it great whenever YouTube has like
terrible PR yeah I didn't actually know
a lot about this story I just knew it
was a bad PR story for YouTube so I was
like well soft looks like I still I
still love YouTube to be completely fair
I spend a lot of time on YouTube but and
we're like started your career on
YouTube that's it yep and we're like
actually not competing with YouTube at
all in any way but the better YouTube
does the better flow plane does 100% so
I actually like at anytime someone's
like okay there's two sections to this
first off anytime someone's like oh
someone just needs to like anyone out
there just needs to make a youtube clone
and then YouTube will die first of all
first of all I'm like well hopefully not
and second of all I'm like well no
that's not how that would work at all
not even slightly
and it's been attempted many times
the reason why you don't know is cuz it
didn't matter what was the most recent
one bid me I think so they're gone dead
alright why don't we you know what since
I'm doing it already anyway this video
is brought to you by a savage jerky did
you want some jerky sure you can't have
mine yeah you can have no habaneros nice
um they're jerky is made from the best
ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives with the goal to create a
snack that's full of flavor and that
isn't bad for you they don't only make
jerky though they also make hot sauces
which are delicious and spice rubs which
I haven't tried yet no you they're
probably delicious that's insulating
yeah which one you want you can go first
this time you want the herb blend I
don't actually care those both sound
water this is mild this is medium heat
um hold on a second let's have a look
signature blend wow they really don't
say oh wait here we go ingredients so
this one is sea salt garlic powder black
pepper paprika chipotle pepper cayenne
pepper habanero pepper cumin turmeric
dehydrated lime juice and silicon
dioxide those both sound amazing but for
very different reasons this one a sea
salt sun-dried tomato powder basil
garlic black pepper oregano thyme
crushed red pepper and parsley well so
that is pretty mild yeah see but I
wouldn't take the herb blend one for
like I think I think I'm going with herb
blend was the right move because the
stuff that I heard in there it's not
really a spice that's just a yeah
favorite thing yeah yeah which one you
want Oh with her blood you know cool
thank you fine I love spicy I'm legit
gonna use this I know you can use offer
code ltte to save 10% off any of their
products at LMG GG / savage jerky this
video is also brought to you mmm my
fingers are so greasy also brought to
you by shade tree shade tree sunglasses
are unique since they're made from
hardwood so no pair is identical the
wood grains are unique even between the
same model they come with polarized
lenses that block UV rays and give you
fantastic clarity and if you have a
screen
it's polarized this way versus that way
like I can read yours but not mine can
you see that I know that one's pretty up
to turn yeah so they are definitely
polarized oh yeah wondering yeah um
blocks UV rays while giving you
fantastic clarity some of their glasses
like their half dome titanium and zebra
version can be ordered with prescription
lenses as well they include a soft and a
hard carry case and you can get 10% off
using offer code Linus at checkout check
them out at shade tree dot-com I'm not
gonna be able to wear these because I
can't read my laptop yeah that's a bit
of a problem on the wine show yes
finally private Internet access what do
I have to say about private Internet
access just go get it
it's like shockingly cheating especially
when you consider that you can log in on
5 devices at once with a single account
and if you're come to LTX it might help
you with cheaper flight tickets hey LM
GGG / p ia
man alright I'm having just one more
there you go actually you know what
we're going snowboarding right yeah so
I'm gonna work this off bring some so I
can eat the whole thing jerky on the
mountains awesome mmm yeah fresh man if
you take like a pit stop somewhere pull
some jerky oh I have not been
snowboarding in so friggin long and you
bored not ski I skied until I was like
11 okay and then I switched to boarding
but I would ski like 20 30 times a year
from when I was like six to when I was
11 and then like three times a year
after that so I've actually skied more
than I've boarded in my life okay do you
think you'll board or ski then all
aboard okay yeah I like it better like
fun to go back on skis I'm also a
cheapskate though and I own a board okay
my board is so old though and I'm fairly
sure the sides are like actually rusty
um a little bit of rust is okay but you
can also give it to there's there's a
shop oh yeah and they can just yeah no
no I'm I'm like actually kind of excited
it's been so long since I've been on a
board yeah speaking of excitement this
is posted by Zed
there are Maxwell on the forum the
Samsung Galaxy fold it was unveiled at
their unpacked event this week it's got
a 7
point three-inch infinity flex display
with a smaller 4.6 inch display that's
used for closed mode it's got 512 gigs
of EU FS 3.0 storage it's got a qualcomm
7 nanometre octa-core processor 12 gigs
of ram because why not it's got two
batteries that are separated by the fold
but combined in the Android operating
system for four thousand three hundred
and eighty milliamp hours into launch on
April 26th at a price of almost two
thousand of US Dollars and that's so ok
so us so convert it to Canadian and
adjusted for inflation because Ajay
called me out when I said this that
phone is legitimately more expensive
than my first car the convertible that
blew up on a bridge it wasn't exactly
the greatest car ever but it still ran
for like a fair amount of years and that
phone is more expensive than it like
that not crazy what no really for a
second I thought you're talking about
the fold in between but how big is the
actual notch I'm pretty sure it's not I
haven't I didn't watch the unpacked
event I didn't either but I've seen
concept shots hold on a second I hope
I'm not blew up ok the car didn't blow
up the fuel pump and fuel injectors
legitimately did pop though dang it
what happened there's a video of it on
YouTube Linus was making fun of me had
to come save me so actually I'll let you
go first this time I'll give you my take
on it after I think it's ridiculous
really yeah I think it's very cool I
think it's probably one of the better
implementations of this that I've seen I
think it's ridiculous because of its
price
oh yeah that's a notch for sure yeah
yeah I think you're right yeah they
really don't show it very much do they
nope
I think it's gonna be very hard to not
break this I think the battery life
issues are going to be real so like the
pretty pronounced I I think it's gonna
it's gonna wow that's very pronounced
yes they really show it there yeah
holy who would play a game like that I
don't really see this as like a gaming
no I batteries in phones suck this has
been known for a while I was talking to
Jaden the other day his a lot of his way
older phones even now have better
battery life than some of these newer
phones by the time you're - let alone
three years into a phone its batteries
just trashed if you use it consistently
like at all so they're gonna expect you
to swap this thing everyone like if
you're spending that much on the phone
you're probably swapping it every year
too because if you're in the market for
that expensive of phones you're probably
not someone who's holding on to the
phone for three years you're probably a
power user who's cycling their phone
pretty quick so you gonna spend like
over two grand on a phone every year
every year or two so they say it should
last for a hundred folds a day for five
years two hundred thousand full but no
one's gonna keep okay so that's good
because then the fold part won't break
in the reasonable lifespan of the phone
so that's good or it shouldn't six
cameras triple camera on the rear well
one of them is 16 megapixel ultra wide
one is 12 megapixel wide-angle and one
is telephoto a 10 megapixel camera for
selfies in the front and two cameras on
the inside for some reason on the giant
notch we're not sure exactly why those
are there games streaming I'm just
guessing so I'm gonna say something that
might not be that popular I think this
is a future I don't disagree with that I
just hope it's not this expensive no
give it time
yeah no it's yeah that's great having a
having a screen that you can pull out of
your pocket that turns this big that's
fantastic I completely agree with you I
don't think that's even that controversy
a matter of time before they'll like
fold to waste sure heck yeah I want
bigger the the like foldable paper that
as digital has been like a dream thing
for for lots of people since my
generation was kids this is this is not
surprising I don't think it is not the
future at all I just think it's crazy
this exact version is nutsoid
and I think I wouldn't be surprised if
part of the price point that they're
doing is like trying to get sort of less
people to buy it because they just want
some of it to go out there and this
thing is gonna be hard to manufacture
this is brand new technology
yeah I mean it's not gonna have that
many of them to put it in perspective
the fact that Samsung is confident
enough to even sell this thing is
mind-blowing to me because yeah one that
I saw at CES from that other company was
terrible well wasn't it Samsung that
went on stage and they showed that like
terrible prototype of their really
blocky one yeah it was Samsung mm-hmm
yeah yeah but no there's someone else
that's selling it mm-hmm that's selling
a foldable phone the thing is awful it's
terrible this looks really smooth the
screen fold on this looks really nice
mm-hmm like actually really that looks
like a very nice phone if it was that
phone but way cheaper it would be very
cool so maybe in a few years hopefully
we'll see but yeah I'm far from
interested in this version I'm stoked
for the people that are because you get
to guinea pig tested for videos I'd want
to try it out but like there's no way I
would end up daily driving it at this
point in time I don't think I mean I
could be I could totally be proven wrong
though I could 100% get use out of it
out of the big screen all that kind of
stuff but yeah yeah I suspect there be
too many problems the fact that even new
releases of normal phones have so many
problems scares me for something like
that but few years down the line yeah be
awesome
all right do we have anything else for
topics today Apple 2019 leaks so
reliable Apple analyst Ming Chico has
released a list of suspected Apple
releases for this year apparently
they'll come back to the display market
with a 6k monitor on a set to feature a
mini LED like backlight design Fenton Oh
fascinating
iPhones will retain lightning
connectivity and will be the same size
ultra wideband connectivity for indoor
positioning
navigation frosted glass casing frosted
glass would be cool be nice mmm upgraded
face idea larger battery is ooh okay Mac
new MacBook Pro between 16 and 16 and a
half inches and a new Mac Pro with easy
to upgrade components our pods to with
support for wireless charging iPod touch
okay iPad 2 new iPad pro models neat you
know what's funny
now flow planes probably gonna have to
buy a Mac Mini what for one of its
employees why for their computer why God
why cuz they would like to work on a Mac
I have to buy a Mac it's a Mac Mini you
know what we actually are planning to
buy another Mac Mini already really yeah
so a lot of the software for ingesting
footage is either Apple only or better
on Apple so the camera then if we can
get the issue sorted out because so far
it hasn't actually been better but if
the camera done figures out a workflow
that's better on Mac the Mac Mini is
kind of unique it's relatively
affordable and it has a 10-game adoption
Wow see it's really small also
relatively affordable have you seen
their RAM options well you can upgrade
the RAM
yourself oh yeah mm-hmm oh yeah so I
thought it was soldered no so you throw
them a couple Mac minis just like on the
back of a monitor or whatever plug in
USB for your card readers and stuff 10
gig LAN it's actually kind of like we
found a use case where the Mac Mini
really was the best computer on the
market for what we were trying to do
nice and compact 10 gig already built in
there you go I know right
who woulda thunk it that that Ram thing
is actually really good to know can you
talk with the drive - no I don't know is
it just RAM that's swappable I believe
so ok good to know
still Apple yeah it just happens to have
swappable Ram
yeah yeah I just thought the drive was
soldered in that's that's actually
really cool that
jadynn can get way more RAM Jaden needs
a Mac work on a PC now yeah but there is
actually he's been having some troubles
today and it's easier for him to develop
on his laptop at home right now I'm
compared to his PC at work so we'll talk
about this later and I think that's it
for wind chill for today guys your fault
you told me I can say your name thanks
for tuning in same bat-time same
bat-channel bye everyone guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
