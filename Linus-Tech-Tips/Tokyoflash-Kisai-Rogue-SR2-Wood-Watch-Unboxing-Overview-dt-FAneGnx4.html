now to learn more this is not the first
time we've unboxed to watch from Tokyo
flash Japan although this is the first
time we've unboxed a watch that's made
of wood this is the rogue sr2 it
includes as you can see right here a
user's manual so the whole Tokyo flash
thing is that they've got uniquely
designed watches many of which are
difficult to read if you haven't been
trained in the fine art of reading them
so this one is no exception there it
also has a very very unique design that
is as I mentioned before wood so check
this out
the entire face of the watch with the
exception of the lens right here so just
the the glass cover is made of just kind
of a actually beautifully finished wood
so you can see all the wood grain here
around the dial as well as for the the
body of the watch right here I'd say if
I had to complain about something the
fit and finish around these knobs isn't
quite as perfect as you might want but
given the price of their watches in
general it's something that I can
definitely understand as with all their
other watches it's fully adjustable so
it's going to arrive in probably quite a
large configuration so you can see for
me to try to put this on is going to
look kind of ridiculous so here you go
even for slick this is quite a bit too
big so there you go I've actually done
guides for how to adjust their watches
in previous Tokyo flash watch unboxing
video so I'm not going to do it this
time around I'm going to make it slicks
problems do his own watch resizing all
the way that the clasp works is pretty
darn standard so if you've ever seen a
watch clasp before you just hold on to
those guys open it up like that looks
pretty good the back of the watch is
again pretty standard for a watch it
actually uses a one watch battery so
with some of the tokyo flash watches
we've looked at before
they're completely LED driven so they
actually use internal batteries and then
you charge them via micro USB not the
case with this one they expect the
battery to last for about a year in
normal use the band is what looks truly
unique to me so you've actually got a
two-tone
finish here that's got a darker wood in
the middle and then a lighter wood
around the outside as an accent in fact
it wouldn't even necessarily be
noticeable to me immediately that this
watch is made of wood I might actually
have a hard time figuring out exactly
what it's made of if I didn't already
know so it's available in a few
different colors we got the orange one
because the one that we really wanted
was out of stocks looks going to be the
one who's laying claim to this
particular watch so you might even see
him wearing it when we're down at PAX
Prime if you're looking for them and
let's get into how you actually read the
freakin thing so the main large blocks
here are going to give you the hours the
tiny blocks around the outside of that
here maybe if I light this up you'll be
able to see it a little better so down
there around 25 that gives you the exact
minutes the Masari did I say haha the
big blocks are approximate minute so
that gives you at a glance okay it's
about 20 past or 25 past and you can see
the exact ones down there the inner
blocks are the hours and then a.m. and
p.m. are denoted by two little half sort
of third circles here or there so it is
p.m. right now that this watch is set to
because there's a little circle along
the side there there's an indicator for
if your alarm set and all that and then
you've obviously got the two buttons
here for changing all the different
settings that you might need to do it
has an orange backlight that's actually
quite strong there you go hopefully I
can get you a good look at that and
other than that I guess there's not
really too much to say so if you want to
check out some of their watches I
personally like some of the all digital
ones a little bit better than this one
but slick really liked the wooden design
so we wanted to check this out so tokyo
flash japan calm guys thank you for
