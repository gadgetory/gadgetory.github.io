open up the popcorn how rc200 so I
wanted to take a chance to open it up
here I've removed all the screws it
didn't take me very long so that I can
kind of show you exactly what's inside
here first of all you've got your
hotspot backplane here for the three and
a half inch drive and you can see that
you can remove this whole thing and you
can remove the three and a half inch
mounting plate that's in here the
adapter and that's how you mount in the
five and a quarter inch blu-ray drive
okay now under there just because you
mount a five and a quarter inch drive
the blu-ray disc doesn't mean you can't
put in a hard drive you can still mount
a tune a half inch hard drive which come
in up to five hundred gigs these days
right down here and use the additional
provided SATA power and SATA cables just
like that and they've actually done a
really nice job of the wire management
in here for you as well now I just want
to have a quick look at the main board
itself over here so you can see you've
got your here's your wireless receiver
here it runs to the antenna at the back
here's the CPU itself that's the Sigma
CPU and if you want to add a fan there's
actually a fed a header for the CPU fan
as well as a header for a rear sixty
mill fan now another thing I wanted to
point out is you've got yet another USB
port so that brings us up to a total of
five USB ports on this unit and then
here we have a do to do to do power
supply which I can't see how many two
amp
max did you do to do yeah whatever okay
so we got the power supply that's there
okay it looks kind of like a PC
motherboard like about a mini ITX sized
motherboard you've even got like a
standard 20 pin it says ATX right on it
connector anyway I just wanted to take a
chance to open up the popcorn RC 200 and
show you the guts thank you for checking
out my video blog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
