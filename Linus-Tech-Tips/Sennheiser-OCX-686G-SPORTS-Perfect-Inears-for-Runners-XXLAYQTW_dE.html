ah yes now that that skits over let's
start with the physical overview of
these headphones at the end of the
nicely textured sporty looking green
cable we have a right-angle 4-pole
connector which I'm very happy they went
with as it can be very annoying to run
with a vertical connector coming out of
a smartphone that is arm mounted moving
up the cable we have one of the smallest
yet best features of these 40 in ears
the tiny plastic clip what does the tiny
plastic clip so cool well it's
adjustable from anywhere to the 3.5
millimeter connector to the remote and
it will make literally on the run cable
management a breeze cable swapping
around during your workout can be
incredibly frustrating and this little
clip will help a lot continuing on we
have the remote I mentioned earlier
which happens to figure a microphone on
the back these headphones come in
different models depending on what phone
you have be sure to check out sennheiser
comm slash compatibility to make sure
yours will work for you if your phone
does work with that little remote you
can use it to interact with your phone
in a number of ways pressing the middle
circle button will accept or end a call
or holding it down for two seconds will
reject said call before it even starts
if you're listening to music that same
button can be used as a single quick tap
for play or pause and then for a longer
two-second tap go on the next song in
your list that's it for the circle
button and the plus and minus buttons
are pretty self-explanatory as they only
control volume next up is the little
slider thing that can yet again help
with cable management well I appreciate
that they included this and I'm sure
some people will use it I personally
find it rather annoying so I'll just
leave it at the top of the remote where
it won't bug me and we can move on to
the in-ears themselves the first thing I
noticed when I grabbed these was just
how boxy they around the ear part was
and I was sure they would be
uncomfortable and I'm okay with
admitting it I was super wrong where
these do look boxy on the outside and
square like on the inside they're
actually more rounded and softer the
experience of wearing them is great they
were very light and I wasn't even really
aware that they were there other than
the fact that they were in my ear I
would probably forget that they were
there if they
the outside part very soft nice
experience for your adapter Sennheiser
has supplied some antimicrobial Sterry
touch ones with small medium and large
for your insertion pleasure I don't have
much data on just how clean these
Thierry touch adapters are but looking
at their quick guide if you happen to
get them sweaty and gross you can just
put them under some tap water and then
hang them to let them dry not something
I've seen or I would actually ever
really recommend with most other
headphones
moving on to audio quality these 20 ohm
impedance 18 to 20,000 Hertz frequency
response earbuds sound actually quite
good I have to admit it wasn't all that
surprising giving Sennheiser's pedigree
but work out people do love their
extremely high volumes at booming bass
so this is mainly what I tested them
with and I'm happy to admit that these
headphones can hold their own in these
categories as well so in conclusion if
you're looking into starting a workout
routine or if you already have been
working out but you're looking for a new
pair of in ears this might be a great
option for you they're super easy to
clean they're safe to haul around with
you and they're around 100 bucks and
sound damn good for it I know for myself
at least that these will happily be
replaced in my Apple earpods and spring
clips setup which weren't the ones that
I crushed by the way what you guys like
