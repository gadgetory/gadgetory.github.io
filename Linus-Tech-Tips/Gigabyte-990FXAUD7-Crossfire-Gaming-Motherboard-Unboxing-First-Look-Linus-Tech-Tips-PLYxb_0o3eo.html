7 this is a truly high-end 990 FX board
from gigabyte features a bucket load of
features including unlock performance
that is to say it is compatible with the
upcoming unlocked FX chips from AMD and
features full support for AMD CrossFireX
nvidia sli then brock it give it a rest
so i guess he just needed attention
isn't that right rocket are you done
bothering us now ok here you go
sweetheart
off he goes alright so yes ambi
crossfire x nvidia sli 333 onboard
acceleration that is USB 3 SE the 3 and
3 x USB power for additional power
through USB hubs or charging higher
powered devices ultra durable three
three-year warranty and a plus two phase
power ok moving along to the inside we
see a window through to the motherboard
we see some glamour shots of the
motherboard itself when we see it
features driver mosfet fan what else we
got over here so we've got support for
four-way SLI and 4-way proxifier now
there's a cool feature dual BIOS which
means if you corrupt your BIOS during
flashing you can restore it using
another physical BIOS chip and hybrid
EFI technology giving you support for 3
terabyte plus hard drives we have a
debug led for diagnosing boot problems
as well as a couple of other things here
including on/off charging for your USB
devices we have one of the front USB
headers on the back we see pretty much
the same stuff that we were looking at
on the inside so let's go ahead
all right now we see the window is funny
the windows small here but it's full
size here someone who was designing the
inner part carton of the packaging was
not talking to the guy who was designing
the outer carton of the packaging new
things I could be wrong though it's
happened before
alright let's have a look at what we've
got in terms of accessories we have a
gigabyte 3-way SLI bridge which is black
very nice I hate seeing a black PCB
gorgeous looking motherboard coming with
like a blue 3-way SLI bridge alright we
have two right angle and two straight
SATA 3 cables we have a crossfire bridge
a 4-way Oh a black very nice black
four-way SLI bridge and another
crossfire bridge okay so we have oh yeah
there it is there's a two-way SLI bridge
all of these are black all of them are
very very nice-looking that's very good
to see I hate mismatched mismatched
three-way and four-way SLI bridges
because you go and build a high end
system and then you put a eyesore on it
not doesn't happen very often color
coded rear i/o shield we have a user's
manual with driver DVD throw that away
download the latest from the gigabyte
website multilingual installation guide
book a gigabyte sticker and a Dolby
Digital home theater sticker and have a
look at the motherboard itself so the
last ud7 board from gigabyte was an XL
ATX form factor and it looks like they
have actually gotten away from that with
this iteration which i think is probably
a move for in the right direction so
let's have a look at the you know what
I'll do my usual thing and then I'll go
back and look at some of the things that
are special about this board so here's
our socket am3+ which supports all of
your standard a.m. 2 a.m. 3 + 3 + CPU
heat sinks as long as it supports the
wattage being output by the CPU then you
should be fine and this is interesting
these are labeled coupon coupon 1 2 3 &amp;amp;
4
those look like voltage readouts but
fascinating so if anyone knows what the
coupon those 4 coupon things are let me
I think maybe they mean CPU five got
nothing okay guys the eight pin power
connectors and its top is in its ideal
location in the top left of the board
we've got our very nice heat pipe
connected chipset and mosfet cooling
solution going on here so top chipsets
ear bottom chipsets here we used to call
them North bridge south bridge now
they're not and then the MOSFETs are
here moving along to the right-hand edge
of the board we find our 24-pin
connector in its ideal location we find
power reset and clear CMOS buttons in a
way better than usual location for
onboard connectors down here is all fine
and good until you install a PCI Express
graphics card near the bottom of the
board and then you can't reach it any
more so this is very smart gigabyte has
said oh we're gonna design a board
that's gonna have up to 4 graphics cards
in it let's make it so you can actually
put 4 graphics cards in it and still
access the features good on you a
gigabyte all right we've got auxilary
power for our graphics cards here so you
can plug an additional SATA connector
love seeing this as a SATA connector
rather than a PCIe or a molex connector
because you're bound to have more extra
SATA connectors than PCIe connectors if
you go and install for graphics cards am
i right okay we've got gigabits gig
gigabyte say two three six gigabit per
second ports here so those are running
off a third-party controller then we
have SATA 3 6 gigabit per second ports
here oh oh ok right so we've got eight
total SATA 3 6 gigabit per second ports
these six are running off the AMD
chipset these two are running off a
gigabyte third-party chipset here is our
debug LED here are our front panel
connectors here is our front USB 3.0
front USB 2 that's the extra power one
you can tell from the red background 2
front USB 2.0 front firewire and front
panel audio headers are available in
terms of our PCIe layout we've got a
very advanced looking PCIe layout here
so here is a 16 X slot here's another 16
X slot so if you're installing 2 cards
those are your guys right there those
are the ones you want to use we've got a
4x slot this is pretty much not intended
to be used because it's right next to
your primary piece
sixteen X slot we have another four X
slot here and we have a PCI slot okay so
if you're installing two 16 X cards they
will run at full 16 X 16 X and you will
be left with an 8 X a 4x and an 8 X for
our expansion okay if you're installing
3 PCI Express graphics cards you will
use this one this one and this one and
you will be left with a single PCIe 8 X
slot for expansion and these will run at
8 X 8 X 8 X in all likelihood although
it might be 16 8 &amp;amp; 8 if you are running
for graphics cards you'll use this one
this one this one and this one they will
run at 8 X 8 X 8 X 8 X so you will still
get pretty much full performance out of
all 4 graphics cards and you better
watch out because you're going to want
to make sure your case has additional
room to hang over that second slot on
the bottom graphics card such as if you
have a coarser 800 D then you're in good
shape because even though it's a 7 PCI
slot case it does have an overhang and
it does have a ventilation slot under
that last expansion card okay the
overall layout of the board looks very
very nice let's show you guys where the
fan headers are so we've got our 4 pin
CPU fan header here we've got a 3 pin
here we've got a 4 pin here and we have
a 3 pin here and not the boat it
actually not too many fan headers on
this guy alright having a look at the
back we've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 USB 2.0
ports this one is one of those combo USB
2 eSATA ports we have another USB wow
what is this thing no that must be eSATA
okay so we've got another eSATA port ps2
keyboard mouse combo port optical and
coaxial digital audio out firewire 2 USB
3.0 ports Gigabit Ethernet and 7.1 audio
so this is pretty much the cream of the
cream for AMD boards you can install
anything from 4-way is 69 70 graphics
card from configuration with 16 gigs of
ram and a high-end 6 core or even 8 core
once they're released CPU you can
install a bunch of SATA
six gigabit per second SSDs this will
accept pretty much anything you throw at
it thank you for checking out my
unboxing of the 990 FX au d7 from
gigabyte and don't forget to subscribe
to Linus tech tips from unboxings
reviews and other computer videos sorry
guys one thing I neglected to mention is
this is slightly wider than ATX it's not
EA TX which would be about here but you
can see that past these three mounting
holes there is a little bit of extra PCB
on the edge here so you should make sure
that your case does support slightly
wider than ATX specification</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
