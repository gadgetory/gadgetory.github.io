cards at their best they allow you to
have a super light and portable laptop
that you can easily convert into a
shockingly potent gaming system when you
have time to sit down and you happen to
have an outlet nearby but the main
complete we hear about them is come on
you guys you can get the same level of
performance with a PCI Express card for
way less but how do you put one of these
in one of these ha the answer is with
one of these meet the exp GDC or the
beast the cheap and dirty way to boost
your laptop's gaming power today's video
is brought to you by PIAA the VPN
service that encrypts all your Internet
traffic and uses a safe protected IP
it's got a ton of other useful features
as well you can check it out at the link
below
so there have actually been quite a few
iterations of the beast but the previous
ones never really appealed to us mostly
because they connected to the system
either to external ports like Express
card a dying if not completely dead
standard or to internal ports that
couldn't be spared most laptops only
have a single mini PCIe slot that is
usually taken up by the Wi-Fi card a
fairly essential component of the mobile
experience but thanks to nvme version
9.5 here has some big advantages so
first it gets four times the number of
PCI Express Lanes four of them here
running at Gen three speeds and second
some mobile devices actually have more
than one m dot two slot like this one so
you should be able to have both a high
speed boot drive and an external GPU
connected at the same time furthermore
because there's no protocol overhead it
should actually perform better than
Thunderbolt 3 enclosures like this one
at a significantly lower cost in theory
so to put that to the test we are
hooking our beast up to the D bottleneck
err 5000 here a powerful desktop with
all three of the connectivity methods
that we want to evaluate we also grabbed
a GTX 1080 so this thing is obviously
much more powerful than any laptop on
the market but we need this combination
of a fast CPU and a high performance GPU
to help us identify which interfaces if
any are causing a bottleneck that will
adversely affect the performance of our
overall system this is pretty trippy
this is like just having your graphics
card like out here it's kind of like
it's like if you had like a human body
that's totally normal and
the heart is on the table next to it and
it's just connected with tubes and wires
and stuff but it works
so in graphically intense games you can
see the performance of the beast ends up
about where we would expect somewhere
between the razor core with Thunderbolt
3 and a graphics card running at full 16
X speed plugged directly into the
motherboard although it should be noted
that in older cpu-bound games like csgo
the FPS was comparable for all three
okay so that all sounds pretty great if
you've got a laptop then with a spare
MDOT to nvme slot like this one that we
mentioned before you could get better
than Thunderbolt three levels of
performance on the cheap yes however I
still find myself asking who is this
actually useful for like you're really
gonna go out and buy a brand new laptop
then literally cut a hole in the bottom
of it for the beast's cabling that will
still need to be run but consider
something a little older like this msi
DL 62 it packs a GTX 940m which I mean
is better than nothing
but barely so if you're looking to play
modern games
you're basically plumb out of luck even
though your CPU is still decent unless
ah yes there it is even though this is a
couple of years old and our configured
it actually used a slow mechanical hard
drive for storage the GL 62 does feature
an nvme capable and dot 2 slot which
means that thanks to that still decent
quad-core CPU I mentioned and the
upgradable ramp remember upgradable
around you guys with a beast and
something like a gtx 960 you could turn
the GL 62
to a gaming ready machine again for just
a couple hundred bucks at least in
theory we have tried everything with
this machine BIOS updates disabling the
integrated graphics disabling the
dedicated graphics newer drivers older
drivers older cards newer cards it just
won't work so the working theory based
on some discussion over on the eg pew
forums those guys are awesome by the way
is that passing a PCI Express signal
over a fairly long couple of HDMI cables
here leads to a fair bit of signal
degradation which was fine on our X 299
motherboard because the m2 slot is
physically close to the CPU socket and
has a strong signal but might cause
problems in laptops where the PCI
Express signal might be within spec but
a little bit lower now some folks
suggested that a shielded m dot - 2 PCIe
4x adapter might actually do better in
this case and they might be right but at
70 US dollars plus the cost of power and
some kind of a mounting mechanism we
don't consider that a viable solution
outside of rare edge cases like
recycling an old laptop as a no longer
portable ghetto
gaming desktop either with that said
let's say that you were trying to do
that
what kind of compatibility could you
expect as it turns out not that great
even the dell inspiron gaming a machine
that this approach could make sense for
requires a custom bios and the rest of
our efforts basically went a little
something like this
so yeah we we gave up because to get the
beast to work with the Triton 700 for
example we'd need a custom bios with
raid disabled and PCI Express hot-swap
enabled in order to get compatibility
with anything that would be faster than
what's already built into it so a 10th
gen Nvidia card so there are people out
there who will happily fork over a
hundred to a hundred and fifty bucks
like the owners of the aging laptops
that we alluded to before or I mean
another good example would be someone
with like a mini ITX desktop who wants
to add 10 gig networking or something
along those lines but for everyone else
the compatibility both physical and in
firmware the user
unfriendliness the general flakiness the
lack of documentation the fact that you
need to reboot to plug and unplug it
from the system and the fact that you'll
probably end up voiding your warranty
are going to confine this product to a
niche within a niche within a niche
forever it's been forever since we've
done this blog for Corsair introducing
Corsairs unplug and play series the dark
core RGB se mouse is quick features one
millisecond 2.4 gigahertz and low
latency Bluetooth connectivity if you
opt for the wireless charging model you
can charge with Corsairs mm 1000 or any
compatible qi wireless charging pad and
there k63 wireless gaming keyboard
features the same low latency connection
options as well as Cherry MX red
switches and a blue LED backlight check
out their entire lineup through the
links below so thanks for watching
guides if this video sucked you know
what to do but if there's awesome again
subscribe hit that like button or check
