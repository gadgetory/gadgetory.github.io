review of the gtx 660ti so in this case
we have galaxies GC dual fan card and
we're comparing it to a couple of
different scenarios so number one is
we're comparing it to a last generation
solution so we've got a gtx 560ti on the
test bench we're going to be running
three different games on the Elder
Scrolls what is a 45 I don't know
something um Skyrim the latest one we're
going to be running crysis 2 slick
really cares that i say that it's elder
scrolls five okay it's good slick so
Zelda schools 5 skyrim and then we've
got prices to and metro 2033 which we
will be doing our usual run throughs
we're going to be using our high details
and ultra details that we normally use
to benchmark these cards except throwing
3d into the mix actually dramatically
increases the load on the card so what
we discovered is that ok ok what we were
trying to find out is how does the 660
ti compared to the 670 which is a
hundred dollars more and how does it
compare to the last generation
equivalent card the 560 TI in 3d
performance so right there so there's a
lot more load on the card in 3d just
because it has to render both the left
eye and the right eye image at the same
time and you can see here that we are
actually getting only about 20 FPS in
crisis to using 3d vision so look
through one of the lenses if you can if
there's a way so you can see that the
leg innocent level is actually quite
high hope you can see that anyway the
point is that it is so let's have a look
at what kind of performance results we
got we're not actually running a
benchmark right now we're all done with
the benchmarking so here we go let's
create some grass charts and graphs
that's like my favorite thing ever so
select data and we're gonna go with our
3d vision performance and we're going to
look at crisis to first oh oh oh I did
it wrong Excel doesn't like it when you
select things in the wrong order
so we're going to look at minimum FPS as
well as average FPS we're going to put
in some data labels so you guys are
seeing the whole graph creation process
here from start to finish including
boldness ok so the 560 TI reference gets
pwned in crisis to minimum FPS is about
a third of what you see on a 660 ti from
the latest generation of nvidia products
using a kepler GPU so remember 560 TI is
Fermi and this says battlefield 3 1080p
eltra but what it means is prices to
fuji there we go so now let's pull up
another chart and graph for you guys in
this case it says it says PE but
actually it's not the 660 ti PE it's the
660 ti GC from galaxy so pay no pay no
mind to that ok yeah these are this is
like my super professional approach to
to graphing for tonight it's actually it
actually is 5am so the 660 ti launches
in an hour which means that we've we
sort of given up on a lot of things and
we're very tired both me and slick slick
splay oh yeah he's nodding I thought he
was planning to be not tired not as
going to be like laiá laiá i adding do
labels holding the data so you can see
here again the 660 ti basically wouldn't
even run like slick couldn't do anything
an average FPS of 10 whereas with a
newer solution whether it's the faster
GPU whether it's the additional vram
which is needed a lot more so in 3d
vision than it is in non 3d vision mode
we were able to get a minimum of 30 FPS
with our 660 ti and this is a bit of an
anomaly where our 670 losses but it is
what it is lots of weird things happen
in benchmarking we try not to question
it too much if you question it then you
might end up understanding it which is
madness sparta something let's go with
metro 2033 I don't even know what I'm
talking about anymore I hope no one
watches this video
that'll be better Metro 2033 and once
again this 560ti gets absolutely creamed
with a whopping 2 point 5 FPS I barely
even could make the jump that I have to
do for my benchmarking run and the 660
ti also gets crushed and so does the
success of me but they do a lot better
than this one by like a order of
magnitude so what we learned today is
that the 660 ti is a worthy upgrade if
you're using a 560 and you want to go
with a 3d vision solution and that the
660 performs pretty closely to a 670
except in one weird instance where it
actually outperformed it I wonder asleep
copied the wrong number down he says no
I think I was the one who are dumb yeah
I worked on those okay so one way or
another the 660 ti is an awesome video
card and my other videos on about this
video card or better you should probably
watch those don't forget to subscribe to

reviews and higher quality videos than
this one and don't forget to said don't
