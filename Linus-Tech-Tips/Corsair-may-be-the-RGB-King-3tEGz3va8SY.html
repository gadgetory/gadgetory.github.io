Computex 2018 coverage check out their
new HS 70 gaming headsets at the link
below it's getting to the point where I
don't even know what to say about RGB
anymore but Corsair has kicked it up yet
another notch with what they're calling
IQ a Corsair interface they're taking
everything that was good about link and
Q so those were their individual
software's for your internal components
and your peripherals and they are
putting them all together as more of
like a complete system software suite
that can monitor your system
temperatures and your clock speeds it
can adjust your RGB animations it can
synchronize animations between the
inside and the outside of your system
and they've got it working with a
whopping 1649 SKUs now most of them are
Coursera but some of the components do
have compatibility across platform like
these all new Vengeance RGB Pro dims and
they are currently working with partners
like gigabyte MSI and a soos to improve
intercom Pat ability across the various
RGB ecosystems some of the coolest
things you can do with IQ because it's
more than just lighting control are
setting up profiles so say for example
when you're at your desktop you can have
like a kind of mellow color shifty thing
going on when you fire up a game you can
have full RGB circus mode light up and
then best of all when you do something
like launch a movie you can have all of
your RGB lighting turn off so that it's
not distracting in the slightest and
because it controls your system fans as
well you can even have all of your fans
either go to a very low rpm for a near
silent operation or even turn off
entirely so that nothing interrupts your
movie watching experience but don't
imagine that this kind of customization
comes cheap the system that we're
looking at here in their newly launched
1000d so this is a close relative to the
concept slate that we actually did a
dual system building not that long ago
the main difference being that it's got
flat tempered glass on the front instead
of curved will cost you
well in excess of one thousand US
dollars this system right here to
control the 24 Corsair light loop fans
which are worth eight hundred plus US
dollars on their own requires four of
their commander Pro control modules and
that's not even including extras like
their RGB strips or their vengeance RGB
pro memory now if you guys are into RGB
memory this is looking like a pretty
significant advancement so they've got a
bunch of the pre-canned animations on
display here but the main advantage
compared to competitors like d skillz
tried and c RGB is that they've got 10
LEDs per module which at this time
cannot be individually adjusted within
the software but on a hardware level are
individually addressable so you can do
all kinds of complex animations like
this one that's like an RGB rotating
clock thing and their software
configuration which is more advanced
than stuff we've seen in the past
including the ability to depending on
your motherboard layout adjust things
like which Tim is in which slot and
which orientation is each Tim in so some
motherboards have the dims all going
this way and then some have them like
this way on either side of the CPU
socket so this allows us to just hit one
button here to reverse the direction and
now all of a sudden our animation is
running in the same direction on each
Tim instead of being in opposite
directions this video like many others
here at Computex 2018 is brought to you
by Corsairs HS 70 it's their new
wireless headset that features comfy
cushiony ear cups a removable microphone
and up to 16 hours of wireless battery
life which I guess oh it's playing in my
ears
does it have it's got a volume control
knob on the back what am i listening to
these guys know how to do a demo you got
that music playing there all right so
thanks for watching guys don't miss any
our Computex 2018 coverage by getting
subscribing we will see you at the next
booth catch at what no no I leave the
camera doesn't leave out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
