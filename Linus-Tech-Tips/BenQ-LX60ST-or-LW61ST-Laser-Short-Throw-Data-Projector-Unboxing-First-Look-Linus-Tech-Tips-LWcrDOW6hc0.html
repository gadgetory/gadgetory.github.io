lx6 txt projector from BenQ this is not
right this is the WXGA model the one
that's actually inside here is the XGA
model this is just a sample unit so you
guys don't worry too much about what
this looks like because yours will come
in a nice shiny new retail package so
inside we find a couple of things
honestly I can't even begin to speculate
what the actual accessory is included
with the retail one would be but I would
say probably it comes with a power cord
and probably it comes with some kind of
video cable it will also come with a
remote that includes a laser pointer so
you can see it's covered with warnings
about lasers and like stuff boom
aha laser oh oh the batteries were not
installed too bad ok so that includes a
bunch of functionality but you're
actually not limited to using this
remote you can even use with the dongle
that you can buy separately just I think
it's like 60 bucks or something like
that you can use your iPhone to control
everything about it and you can even
stream images slideshows or PowerPoint
presentations and you can just like flip
between the slides like this and stream
them directly to the wireless dongle
which is kind of cool
it actually works with a bunch of neq
projectors if you check out their app on
the iTunes Store app store flavor is
cult whatever it is it's not called
Google Play because it's only for Apple
but it's I if you check out the app it
actually has a list of which projectors
are compatible with the dongle and the
app now this is a very cool projector
will you buy one the answer is probably
not
will this technology trickle down and
will you eventually be able to buy
something like it the answer is quite
possibly because this is more of a
corporate view more for presentation
halls schools stuff like that and less
about the actual individual end user
here so this is a solid-state laser
projector which has a
whole whack load of different advantages
like standing in front of my notes I
think including the fact that the I mean
I can't even call it ball replacement
estimating time so it they estimate Bank
you estimates that you will get ten
thousand hours of use out of this before
you will actually have to replace the
DLP wheel now it also has an eight
segment wheel
besides the laser backlighting it has an
eight segment wheel which compared to
most projectors in this kind of a
product class right now are using a
sixth segment wheel which gives you
better color reproduction as well as
absolutely wicked eighty thousand to one
contrast ratio and we're not talking
like funky dynamic contrast ratios we're
talking actual contrast ratio we had
this fired up before I put it back in
the box and I gotta say guys for a DLP
projector it absolutely blew me away in
terms of the vividness of the colors
like even looking at the Windows desktop
the windows logo in the middle the green
and the yellow are distinctly different
than they really pop even on this like
crappy off-white wall so that was very
cool about it no moving parts other than
the fan why do you have no moving parts
written down there okay well forget that
it's a short throw projector which means
that from here to the wall we were able
to project an image that was about from
here to about here and here to here so
big old huge image the practical limits
of this in a dark environment are about
300 inches but I'd say probably closer
to 100 to 150 inches if you're in a more
brightly lit kind of environment what
else are we missing here I want to make
sure we don't miss anything right it's
available on xga or WXGA
and aha it's green so no mercury since
there is no traditional projector lamp
there's no mercury inside the projector
lamp so that means that if it's you know
thrown away or disposed of in any
particular way you don't have to worry
about the environmental impact of that
beyond just the fact that it's you know
plastic and you shouldn't throw away
electronics more than you absolutely
have to finally three year parts and
labor warranty and near-instant on and
off so it takes about three seconds to
turn off and about six seconds
turn back on immediately which is very
cool compared to some of the uber slow
traditionally backlit projectors that
we've seen in the past I look at
engineering a sample suite also has a 20
watt speaker built-in and let's go ahead
and take a bit of a product to her here
so here's the focus wheel it's got big
old grippy neural shenanigans going on
here all right it's got like kind of a
nice blue thing going on you can
actually mount this any way you want it
can even mount in portrait mode and it
is compatible with that so you can yeah
I mean I can't imagine you know what
leave a comment guys leave a comment if
you can think of a reason to mount a
projector in portrait mode and have it
be like like a portrait image like
right-side up like I cannot cannot
imagine why you'd want that you can
actually see the internals a little bit
here you can see some electronics and
whatnots and who has and here you can
see some heat sinks and fans and cooling
stuff going on it doesn't get super loud
but I mean it's not silent or anything
either in terms of inputs we've got a
pretty wide variety we've got audio in 1
&amp;amp; 2 audio out as well as a microphone
jack we've got our traditional old
analog stuff so you got your composite
you got your s-video you got your audio
right and left you've got up to 2 VG A's
in a monitor out HDMI in 2 USB ports so
that's where you'll plug in that
wireless dongle which actually looks a
little something like this you can also
read certain things directly off of it
if you check out my GP 2 video I show
you some of the cool things you can do
with Ben Q's built-in software also have
a serial port mini USB B LAN and finally
a 12-volt trigger finally again the
power and finally once more the
Kensington lock I think that pretty much
covers it so stay tuned guys because I'm
gonna be doing a proper NCIX tech tips
on this particular model so this is just
gonna be an unboxing don't forget to
