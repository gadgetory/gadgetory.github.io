new notebook from MSI so let's talk
about the key features which are light
slim aesthetics so they're saying it's
light they're saying it's slim and
they're saying it has a good aesthetic
that is actually an excellent three
words summary okay here we go your
notebook content on your TV all it
supports a wide I why display okay cool
a visibly smart experience powered by
the second generation Intel Core
processor family excellent up to eight
hours of battery life performance that
won't weigh you down ways to kilograms
and a one inch super slim design very
cool all right let's go into the side
where it says absolutely nothing it's go
around the other side where it says
exactly the same thing and on the other
side where we have the Box open so let's
show you guys the notebooking question
here so this is the x 4 60 X right here
this is a special one this notebook is
an engineering sample not for selling
the software and application installed
our four test and evaluation only so
this is definitely a testing and
evaluation type of video so I am
authorized to use it I have the power
brick here I have the power cord here
you can actually see in the packaging
here where the manual and instructions
and discs and stuff will go but that's
not included with an engineering sample
notebook and next we have the battery
which is a little padded pink
anti-static bubble wrap so let's go
ahead and I guess the first thing we'll
show you is how to install the battery
so you go ahead flip the notebook over
take the battery line it up line up the
thing with the thing and then press the
thing on to the other thing there we go
go ahead close that up and let's have a
look at this notebook here so first
things first let's take off the plastic
so we've got a nice brushed brushed
finish on the top I actually don't know
what it's made of yep that seems to be
made of aluminum it's nice and cold it's
definitely metal so can you see that
okay not like a shiny MSI logo on the
top so that's like more of a metal kind
of finish i wonder how they've built
that in is that
sticker or what no it looks to be looks
to be worked right into the aluminum top
very very slim very stylish okay so
speaking of slim there is the thickness
of the display itself so i'm going to go
ahead you see the old iphone comparison
so you can see that's quite slick
looking this uses a chiclet keyboard
it's got a little emma side padded thing
you'll probably want to hold on to that
because it keeps the keyboard from
imprinting itself on the screen above it
when you close up the laptop times go
ahead take off the rest of the plastic
here there we go so the X 460 DX
actually comes in a variety of different
specs depending on the region because
this is an engineering sample one it is
a little bit on the weaker side so it
has a weaker CPU it's only got two gigs
of RAM although i believe the retail
skews will start at four gigs of ram
this one only has a 500 gig drive but
depending on your region it could have
different drive characteristics it does
feature USB 3 bluetooth true Studio Pro
interesting okay it has turbo + battery
turbo battery plus rather so what
they're saying is eight hours of battery
life and it does have a 1366 x 768 so
that is a 720p ready HD display and that
is an LED backlit display another thing
that's cool about this particular
notebook is that it does feature
dedicated graphics so it has a gt540 GPU
so here you can see the thickness
compared to an iphone 4 and let's work
our way around the notebook and show all
of the different things as so it has a
Kensington lock it has a DVD Drive it
has a USB port an SD card reader it has
a microphone and a headphone port moving
around to the front we see not a whole
lot other than some indicator lights so
for hard drive Bluetooth wireless
battery caps lock and number lock all
indicated on there moving around to the
other side we've got USB 3 2 ports
gigabit ethernet VGA and HDMI I'm
actually still happy to see vga worked
into modern notebooks because for
something like this especially a more
slick business style notebook having vga
is very handy because a lot of older
projectors do not support hdmi
so that gives you an option to output
when you're doing a business
presentation when you're on the road
we've got a huge exhaust port here so
that's taking care of the cooling for
the CPU as well as the gt540 GPU and
finally we have a DC import here to
power the notebook let's go ahead and
flip it over onto its back so you can
see where all of the intake is coming in
is right around here and then that will
be pulled across the motherboard and
then out the back of the oat rather
across the motherboard and then out the
side of the notebook over here so that's
where you are bringing in all of your
cooling you can also upgrade any
components inside the notebook that you
should see fit simply by unscrewing this
this this this this this and that's it
screws you can take off this whole panel
here you can upgrade your RAM I can
actually see the random clips right
there which is something you'd want to
do if you got a 2gig model like this one
but like I said none of the retail ones
will actually be two kegs so there's our
power switch right up there at the top
left and let's have a look at the
chiclet style keyboard and do some quick
evaluation of that guy while it boots up
so I'm a continuous system resume I'm a
big fan of any keyboard that feels very
solid this one's actually pretty good up
continuous system resume I think cuz I
keep pressing buttons it's getting
confused and I'm a big fan of any laptop
keyboard that has appropriate spacing so
you can see right here they have not cut
the shift key short which is in my
opinion a cardinal sin they have not
moved this shift key over to the right
so you can see it's quite easily
accessed and the backspace key has also
not been shortened when it's been
shortened you gotta reach way over there
in order to backspace and if you make
anywhere near as many mistakes as I do
when I'm typing that is not convenient
the enter key is also a full width enter
key which is very handy as well now
let's have a look at the touchpad so the
touchpad has a bit of a texture to it
you can actually see it has kind of a
concentric circle style design to the
top of it so that gives you a little bit
of texture feedback when you're using it
seems quite accurate just based on my
quick usage of it here although I will
say that the circles cause your finger
to be slightly redirected like if you're
trying to move
line across it here it might cause it to
curve a little bit like that so you do
have to be a little bit forceful when
you're using it but like I said
sensitivity accuracy seemed pretty good
so far this piece right here is your
left as well as your right click and
it's kind of a chromed piece of what
appears to be yeah I think that's
plastic the metal I'm feeling is just
right here actually I can't quite tell
if that's made of metal or if it's not
it's cool to the touch but it's some
interesting no I think that's plastic I
wonder if the top is plastic too then no
the top couldn't be nope ok so this
piece is plasticville which I actually
prefer to an aluminum brushed finish
here because what tends to happen to
aluminum when it's positioned here is
when you type for a long time the grease
from your hands and your fingers will
etch into the aluminum and will cause it
to be worn away such that you can't and
it'll ruin the finish that such that you
can't even clean it you can't even fix
it so there's the turbo battery button
and what else do we have in terms of
interesting buttons and features your
speakers are located here and a bar at
the top of the notebook itself with a
nice little chromed accent running
through it looks quite nice and I think
that's pretty much all there is to say
at this time so thank you for checking
