new notebook from MSI so let's talk
about the key features which are light
slim aesthetics so they're saying it's
light they're saying it's slim and
they're saying it has a good aesthetic
that is actually an excellent three word
summary okay here we go your notebook
content on your TV oh it supports why'd
I why display okay cool a visibly smart
experience powered by the second
generation Intel Core processor family
excellent up to eight hours of battery
life performance that won't weigh you
down weighs two kilograms and a one inch
super slim design very cool alright
let's go into the side where it says
absolutely nothing it's going on the
other side where it says exactly the
same thing and on the other side where
we have the Box open so let's show you
guys the note booking question here so
this is the X 460 X right here this is a
special one this notebook is an
engineering sample not for selling the
software an application installed are
for test and evaluation only so this is
definitely a testing and evaluation type
of video so I am authorized to use it I
have the power brick here I have the
power cord here you can actually see in
the packaging here where the manual and
instructions and discs and stuff will go
but that's not included with an
engineering sample notebook and next we
have the battery which is an it's little
padded pink anti-static bubble wrap so
let's go ahead and I guess the first
thing we'll show you is how to install
the battery so you go ahead flip the
notebook over take the battery line it
up line up the thing with the thing and
then press the thing on to the other
thing there we go
go ahead close that up and let's have a
look at this notebook here so first
things first let's take off the plastic
so we've got a nice brush tool brushed
finish on the top I actually don't know
what it's made of yep that seems to be
made of aluminum it's nice and cold it's
definitely metal so can you see that
okay got like a shiny MSI logo on the
top so that's like more of a metal kind
of finish I wonder how they've built
that in its
sticker or what looks to be looks to be
worked right into the aluminum top very
very slim very stylish okay so speaking
of slim there is the thickness of the
display itself so I'm gonna go ahead the
old iPhone comparison so you can see
that's quite slick looking this uses a
chiclet keyboard it's got a little em'ly
side padded thing you'll probably want
to hold on to that because it keeps the
keyboard from imprinting itself on the
screen above it when you close up the
laptop let's go ahead take off the rest
of the plastic here there we go so the X
460 DX actually comes in a variety of
different specs depending on the region
because this is an engineering sample
one it is a little bit on the weaker
side so it has a weaker CPU it's only
got two gigs of RAM although I believe
the retail SKUs will start at four gigs
of RAM this one only has a 500 gig drive
but depending on your region it could
have different Drive characteristics it
does feature USB 3 Bluetooth truestudio
Pro hmm interesting okay it has turbo
plus battery turbo battery plus rather
so what they're saying is 8 hours of
battery life and it does have a 1366 by
768 so that is a 720p ready HD display
and that is an LED backlit display
another thing that's cool about this
particular notebook is that it does
feature a dedicated graphics so it has a
gt540 GPU so here you can see the
thickness compared to an iPhone 4 and
let's work our way around the notebook
and show all of the different things it
has so it has a Kensington lock it has a
DVD drive it has a USB port an SD card
reader it has a microphone and a
headphone port moving around to the
front we see not a whole lot other than
some indicator lights so for hard drive
Bluetooth wireless battery caps lock and
number lock all indicated on there
moving around to the other side we've
got USB 3 2 ports Gigabit Ethernet VGA
and HDMI I'm actually still happy to see
VGA worked into modern notebooks because
for something like this especially a
more slick business style notebook
having EGA is very handy because a lot
of older projectors do not support HDMI
so that gives you an option to output
when you're doing a business
presentation when you're on the road
we've got a huge exhaust port here so
that's taking care of the cooling for
the CPU as well as the gt540 GPU and
finally we have a DC in Port here to
power the notebook let's go ahead and
flip it over onto its back so you can
see where all of the intake is coming in
is right around here and then that will
be pulled across the motherboard and
then out the back of the aute rather
across the motherboard and then out the
side of the notebook over here so that's
where you are bringing in all of your
cooling you can also upgrade any
components inside the notebook that you
should see fit simply by unscrewing this
this this this this this and that's it
it screws you can take off this whole
panel here you can upgrade your RAM I
can actually see the RAM clips right
there which is something you'd want to
do if you've got a 2gig model like this
one but like I said none of the retail
ones will actually be two kegs so
there's our power switch right up there
at the top left and let's have a look at
the chiclet style keyboard and do some
quick evaluation of that guy well it
boots up so I'm continuing system resume
I'm a big fan of any keyboard that feels
very solid this one's actually pretty
good can you a system resume I think cuz
I keep pressing buttons it's getting
confused and I'm a big fan of any laptop
keyboard that has appropriate spacing so
you can see right here they have not cut
the shift-key short which is in my
opinion a cardinal sin they have not
moved this shift key over to the right
so you can see it's quite easily
accessed and the backspace key has also
not been shortened when it's been
shortened you get a reach way over there
in order to backspace and if you make
anywhere near as many mistakes as I do
when I'm typing that is not convenient
the Enter key is also a full width Enter
key which is very handy as well now
let's have a look at the touchpad so the
touchpad has a bit of a texture to it
you can actually see it has kind of a
concentric circle style design to the
top of it so that gives you a little bit
of texture feedback when you're using it
seems quite accurate just based on my
quick usage of it here although I will
say that the circles
cause your finger to be slightly
redirected like if you're trying to move
in a straight line I'll cross it here it
might cause it to curve a little bit
like that so you do have to be a little
bit forceful when you're using it but
like I said sensitivity accuracy seemed
pretty good so far this piece right here
is your left as well as your right click
and it's kind of a chromed piece of what
appears to be yeah I think that's
plastic the metal I'm feeling is just
right here okay I can't quite tell if
that's made of metal or if it's not it's
cool to the touch but it's interesting
no I think that's plastic I wonder if
the top is plastic too then no the top
couldn't be nope okay so this piece is
plastic though which I actually prefer
to an aluminum brush finish here because
what tends to happen to aluminum when
it's positioned here is when you type
for a long time the grease from your
hands and your fingers will etch into
the aluminum and will cause it to be
worn away such that you can't and it'll
ruin the finish such that you can't even
clean it you can't even fix it so
there's the turbo battery button and
what else do we have in terms of
interesting buttons and features your
speakers are located here and a bar at
the top of the notebook itself with a
nice little chromed accent running
through it that's quite nice and I think
that's pretty much all there is to say
at this time so thank you for checking
