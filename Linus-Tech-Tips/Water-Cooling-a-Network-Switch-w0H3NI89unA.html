assembling what is the very first Linus
Media Group manufactured CPU water block
now of course our objective though in
all of that was not to build a CPU water
block because quite frankly we could
call up our friends at alpha cool decays
basically anyone and they would do a
much better job of it than we did no
thanks yeah none taken
the objective was for us to water cool a
red 8k camera but baby steps right so
this was doing something pretty normal
where we could basically clone a Chinese
design and then just put it on the CNC
today we kick things up a notch
this we're gonna water cool something a
little unusual our ten gigabit twelve
port network switch from Netgear that
was actually the first 10 gigabit piece
of equipment that we've got well not
counting like network cards like a
switch
the hot docs uses the Ergo docks design
which keeps you comfortable typing away
for long periods of time and features
qmk firmware and hot swappable key
switches check it out at the link below
so this is it they don't get their
network switch anymore in the camera
again
yep just don't plug it yep alright well
- oh crap we were supposed to do the
sound test first that's kind of the
whole point if you guys it's really loud
yeah this is gonna be a very inexact
unscientific test here fifty six
decibels you're on boot-up okay let's
water cool it
how much does Steve pay us for all this
product placement that he gets on our
Channel like nothing so the reason that
network switches are really loud and run
really hot is not necessarily because
the hardware inside them it has a ton of
power draw or anything like that it's
because cooling them is a real challenge
most network switches even at the
prosumer level are in what's called a
single u which is the I don't know the
universal unit that's where the U comes
from I'm just kidding I made all of that
up for height in a rack so that means
you can only use these wimpy 40
millimeter fans and a lot of the time
you also don't have a lot of ventilation
holes for whatever reason no it's funny
I actually brought my own handle because
I was using this for something before we
started so I can help oh man I just
stripped that dude that took a long time
I'm gonna go get a bigger screwdriver oh
there's the one he stripped
oh bloody hell I just tricked this one
to see I just had to go in the street so
my mom always said what I'm actually
really looking forward to this I have
it's it's a funny thing because like
computers the first thing I do with them
is open them up like laptops and stuff
but it's never occurred to me to open up
our 10 gig networks which is this one oh
oh there we go up and back
whoo holy crap there's a lot of stuff to
pull in here
what is this are they ripping us off is
there another portal put on the front
maybe they're just afraid of having it
be 13 plot so here's our power supply
that we're definitely not going to touch
or even get close to so my intention had
been to keep it 1u mountable though oh
okay
yeah but then just have like tubing out
like quick connects or something and
then like an external rad okay I mean
that's one option I'm not married to it
though
for whatever reason in my mind I was
picturing kind of like this goes on here
yeah and we just like cut two holes for
tubing and then mount a rat like right
here like full like like engine block
showing through the top of the hood
muscle car muscle switch then I guess if
you really wanted to we could put like
some tea connectors in there so you can
make it a one you have it go out the
side so it looks like every one of these
heat sinks is hard mountain so there's
screws going in from the bottom of the
PCB in this whole mainboard needs to
come out before we're gonna be able to
remove any of this now to be clear this
is not as expensive as a red camera but
this is still today what like an $800
Network switch or something like that I
have no clue yeah let's be careful with
it cuz I can't remember how much it
costs either it's not cheap though I
almost wonder if we could just get away
with putting little copper things on
here sort of like you said but then run
a heat pipe just straight across all of
them if we used a ball nose bit that was
the right size we could cut a channel
right in the top of it the right size
for the heat pipe yep and then just
solder it on
and and then we managed to spread the
heat out that way okay and that way
we've just got this big spreader that'll
carry the heat theoretically hopefully
towards our cooling yeah okay wait a
minute
what Oh soldered on there's no way how
could they possibly be that's gonna be a
pain in the butt should I go get the
soldering iron yeah all right what do
you think the chances are that they're
soldered on and then epoxy it underneath
I was just thinking well we do have a
way how hard do you think it is just
snip those Oh easy as pie
I should have been wearing eye
protection for that Brandon you're
wearing glasses right yeah I think we
can get in there and just give her like
a little snip you got to be kidding me
oh you you're doing it you actually did
it you actually did that works so well
everybody's got our production
everybody's going to be screaming so
much like they got so mad when I just
like hacked off the DVI connector and
that's like a bunch of pins that one
eight over there and the lens over there
this is so dumb what we do out yeah not
bad so you got a couple challenges these
look like they're up a little high so we
might end up having to kind of go around
them also not all these holes came clear
so we might have to either pop them back
out or actually desolder them properly
if we want mounting points for our block
yeah your copper slab to cover it is
probably the simplest way here's our
main CPU block and then we do a short
heat pipe here and a long heat pipe here
this is actually going to be pretty
difficult yeah I don't know why I wasn't
thinking it would be difficult but it's
going to be quite difficult
can we can we do this where I actually
here hold on hold on hold on can we can
we pretend that I had something to do
with this I'm like oh god what did you
do okay you can do it so what did you do
that over the last week or so he created
this fantastic well I mean what would
you call this model yeah just like a
little model today we have the switch
here all of the critical measurements
for our water cooling is in there and
you ended up buying new calipers for
that is that right yeah no it's the
Alex's calipers and these are really
fancy because there's very beautiful and
expensive we have problems in the past
where I would measure a bunch of things
and error would stack up so yes there
were a couple problems that we had to
solve here so the first is that I was
pretty concerned that having this many
heat sources on one heat pipe would
cause problems so we have this paper
here that sort of solved this for us
which is an investigation of thermal
characteristics on a center of wick heat
pipe with double heat sources basically
tells us you want your heat sources to
be as close to the condenser as possible
so our condenser is effectively this
segment of the heat pipe right here
where it will be thermal epoxy to this
copper plate which is going to be
water-cooled then I guess other things
Jonathan from a sentence ceiling
contacted us and we have a heck of a
range like he's just he's just been
raining over Ang's on us so so we have
better Oh rings this yeah
and also his card stock is amazing like
look at this it's quality yeah can we
get some of this no and yeah we have new
o-ring loop so basically nothing can go
yeah well things can go wrong but that's
what we're about to get to the hard part
though is that we have to actually
machine this so how do you machine a
rounded groove so we have a ball nosed
and mill mm-hmm so that's just like it's
round on the end and you
kind of kinda just like that which was
this was like surprisingly hard to get
to work properly uh-huh
so big shout out to CJ from Autodesk he
really it's gonna be like half a sketchy
one because we can't go any lower than
seventy eight thousand rpm on our CNC
router so really we should be using a
mill for this we should be using a mill
for this we don't have a mill because
they're expensive yes when you're going
to cut metal you need to make sure that
every single time that the tooth comes
around you're actually like cutting out
a chunk of metal or it's just gonna rub
and it's gonna burn it out really fast
so since we can't make the tool spin
slower we need to run it faster being
safe right yeah I don't want people
yelling at us about our CNC
do you want to plug in the air
compressor yeah I'd love to
we do have actual mist cooling now so
everyone that's saying you should have
cooling we already have to believe well
you can definitely see the shmoo here so
is this just getting like more and more
legit every time we do a video yeah
basically this is leaking
yeah it got dropped so we're ready yep
can i press go
I like to feel like I'm helping and
that's the tool that we have so yeah go
that is not that clean-looking No
ah when we're done so what happened
there was the piece of copper that we're
trying to cut shifted which means that
the entire tool path that Alex laid out
is now offset by about three-quarters of
the centimeters so it's possible that we
would have ended up with something
usable but our thermal transfer is not
going to be great I mean if it had held
down we would have something here and
here anyway
I could that's really bad for the tool
and we have to make four of them and
we're back this time with a bit of a new
plan so now we have bolted our copper
plate down to the bed we have also made
some Canadian engineering repairs to our
reservoir down here it no longer leaks
thanks to some hand-mix epoxy and we
have done away with our plan to make
rounded grooves because we don't have a
mill we only have a router so why don't
we just let the work speak for itself
instead of telling them what's gonna
happen I can press go now right eh
let's see the finished product so this
is going to be the top of one of our
blocks this is going to be the top of
one of our other more different blocks
this is the block we made last time
which is still here again for some
reason we're using the bottom of it
oh we're just reusing yeah I mean why
dull your bits when you don't have to oh
is this it yeah so this is the moment of
truth right now Oh perfect
it really is actually yeah it's 0.1 of a
millimeter oversized
good work I'm happy with that um I guess
we just need to clean these off and tap
them look at that it just looks so good
underneath completely see-through we
didn't bother facing it this time that
should go there yeah that goes right and
then we'll have the three that go down
the middle here cool that's a lot of
copper now you told me Pro Mode was
gonna have the heat pipe on the bottom
so that we were like heat pipe direct
touch cooling yeah are we doing that
with this one no not with this one no
that's gonna be version two I mean
version two we need to get this done
because Ed's mad they don't have a
switch for their ingest crap but yeah
ingest crap we don't we don't need these
videos but yeah we're going to have to
redesign this guy an alpha cool is
coming up with those like the server
sized heat sinks so those are gonna like
go on the side and it's gonna look super
legit but until then we're just gonna
like have it lightest active style just
like below the in gestation these screws
not quite we don't have to widen the
holes in the PCB do we are you kidding
me
well it's potentially gonna be the
quietest and cool to switch on all right
like everywhere arguably a switch that
doesn't power on anymore is very quiet
and very cool this bit might actually be
too small that went super well nope
we're good
what that was it yep that's that's all
that we needed oh nice
we should probably give this a little
dusty here yeah something yeah this is
pretty bad yeah I was definitely one of
the worst ideas I've ever seen like am I
just going at it with this I like
legitimately straight-up forget how to
do it what about this time we just like
clamp it like this yeah off the table
yeah you can just kind of get this on
the side like like so and blammo blammo
okay there are a lot of people that were
really mad last time that we didn't use
the drill press to do this so it would
go down perfectly straight oh yeah that
would be smart wouldn't it yeah really
would nope No
but what the crap is this grabs what
this whole doesn't go all the way
straight through the drill press had an
issue yeah that's good okay this is the
really bad one I don't know about that
well you'll build us up from the bottom
oh jeez what did you just do that is
that's pure carnage right there Oh God
that's a lot of acrylic on the floor
yeah these don't quite line up well like
do you want to tap those holes again
okay so you're just kind of doing the
same thing as last time then yep
acrylate me extra cyano on the side and
theoretically it will seal we're asking
for a lot of tight tolerances to line up
here yep we're gonna put that through a
plastic washer okay so that goes there
then we do another plastic washer I'm
assuming um yep okay can we do a nut yep
nothing there so I've realized something
really unfortunate where this right here
screws in I thought that it was just
like nuts on the back that came up yeah
but it's actually screwed right into the
chassis yeah I don't know if these can
come off Oh
I can't believe that you got all these
holes to mostly sort of line up I
measured it are you guys as excited as
we are to see if this thing is still
gonna work I am I'm am assuming that we
didn't kill it it's gonna work pretty
well I mean we didn't do anything that
bad to it not really we're not gonna
actually power on the switch we're just
gonna power this pump and then make sure
that nothing leaks did you fart
yeah but like a couple of minutes ago
it's really lingering no I'm sorry about
that it's awkward
all right well given that our system
here has passed our exhaustive
three-minute stress test would you say
we're ready to power it on yeah there's
a light David oh it's green identify
it's green that means 10 giggling oh
yeah test and there it goes
indeed boom okay so now what nope
yeah we we actually get to put it
together yeah I guess so okay
damn I have screencap going so you don't
need to take them over here
there is one more test though it's
possible that we're not making good
contact with anything like we actually
don't know that just because it's
working that means it's working well I
love that our fans just say failure
stand up and I'll plugged in question
for you though yeah did you get new like
quieter 40-millimeter fans to replace
these well yes if it's just open can we
just stick like a 140 on top or
something yes yes we can all right
yeah so what we can do is we can take
this puppy put it on do a 140 millimeter
cutout mount the radiator to that so
that nothing could slip through put the
fan on top and put a fangirl on
disassemble this yeah and put it in and
I'll get a hole in here sure cool are
you gonna measure where the hole goes
yep so I think we're almost done here
okay speak for yourself because we need
to power the pump oh I think what we
have to do is plug in the power supply
and start probing
some panic mode and I put it in the air
meter oh all right well let's see if
anything still works bull bolts yay Wow
it's a Christmas friggin miracle okay so
that is
ground and 12-volt so ground is the
far-left 12-volt is the third
theoretically orange is ground what the
black is positive 12 volt and yes Jake
it matters okay I have good news though
look what I found
what in the balls is the huh this is a 6
pin PCI Express adapter see these two
pins it's a six to eight pin adapter we
can use these two wires to find our 12
volt power and then splice that on to
the power connector for the pump then as
long as we get the right two pins then
we're good okay so what did I say orange
was ground black was 12 volt yep neat
theoretically when I plug in the switch
it will turn on with no sparks
power LEDs lit ah and theoretically okay
more sanity check time I have 12 volts
here Paul huzzah
what a nightmare and I just need to get
to connect to this yeah other than the
whole in beginning this is actually
surprisingly like sort of properly done
yeah like sort of properly I mean
there's no proper way to do something
this stupid yeah like I guess we could
get a couple zip ties in there like yeah
100% pro-ltte cable ties get that
shilling in there oh yeah mmm
bit concerned about putting us on okay
we have to kind of go over the tubes and
just not splice them well what can you
get your hand in there when it's like
that uh yeah I have small hands here if
you let go here I can help you align
this side you might as how well have
these ones kind of come up with
similarly you know okay the best part is
that like it looks so good on the inside
like it's pretty like pro like all
machine and stuff and on the outside
it's just like straight like ghetto like
not even same color too hot rotted like
it's not very space-efficient it's very
heat efficient yeah no it's a lot
quieter yeah did you see how quiet it is
thing I ever actually heard it it was
like yeah it was pretty luck it's still
working
temperatures are actually lower yeah
well we have a fan running on the
radiator now so that's an improvement
now we're looking at 27 and 28 degrees
compared to like 51 and 42 you folks are
dead silent and let's do a quick file
transfer here here we go I'm liking it
Backblaze is an unlimited cloud backup
for Macs and PCs that's just six bucks a
month they've restored over 35 billion
files and they backup documents music
photos videos drawings projects pretty
much anything and you can restore your
files from anywhere you can directly
download them from the web or restore
them by mail even their mobile app gives
you access to your files on the go and
actually this is great if you do the
restore by mail option you can purchase
restore via hard drive they will
overnight FedEx do the drive and then
after you copy everything to your new
storage device you can return the hard
drive to them for a refund
there's no wonky cause structures and it
is truly unlimited data backup at a
fixed price so try it out fully featured
for 15 days for nothing at Backblaze
comm slash LTT go there play with it
