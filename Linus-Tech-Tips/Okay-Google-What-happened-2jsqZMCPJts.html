I ended up in this situation well let's
just say the world is a tough place for
a tablet trying to be a laptop I'd
explain why but I think the better
person to tell that story is the guy
that just threw me away huh well at
least I landed on something soft right
next to today's sponsor antlion audio
and lion audios new mod mic Wireless
features a low latency high quality
sample rate LED status indicators up to
12 hours of battery life and more check
it out at the link below
believe it or not this is only the third
Chrome OS powered pixel device that
Google has released like I know right so
first we had the Chromebook pixel way
back in 2013 it looked very similar to a
mac book and it was positioned as a
high-end option for Google's Chrome OS
which until then was a fixture on 150
dollar laptops and not much else it was
supposed to lead the way forward
clearing a path for Chromebooks to
become a real alternative to Windows PCs
and Mac's but while Chrome OS did
continue to develop that vision never
really came to fruition and we wouldn't
see Chrome OS on another pixel device
until a whopping four years later with
27 teens pixel book now our verdict on
that device was about the same as the
original Chromebook pixel pretty good
hardware bad software and too expensive
not to be deterred by its past failures
though Google has now added the pixel
slate to the lineup seemingly thinking
that maybe Chrome OS with its ability to
natively run Android apps would work
better as a tablet that could also be
used as a laptop than as a laptop that
can run tablet apps and well actually
they are partially correct as a tablet
the pixel slate is surprisingly pretty
great the 3000 by 2,000 resolution LCD
display is bright and decently color
accurate it's thin it's light and the
dual front-facing speakers are simply
put incredible like there's way more
lows and mids than you'd expect to hear
from a mobile device seriously these
speakers are sick and it's got some
other features that are notably absent
from the iPad pro that really hurt
Apple's case for the iPad pro as a
laptop replacement one the pixel slate
has Mel support
kind of a big deal Apple to USB type-c
ports that is to say it has two USB
type-c ports not the USB type-c ports
PowerPoint number two well I mean it is
that two anyway anyway both of them can
be used for charging which opens up the
accessory possibilities a fair bit three
it has support for external storage
external storage like come on let's get
round of applause here yeah yeah and for
you can set the screen at more than two
angles nice but comparing devices based
on their specs and features won't get us
the whole story here so we need to dive
a little bit deeper
starting with pricing some of the
loadouts of the pixel slate look pretty
decent until you look closely err and
realize that you were paying a thousand
US dollars for a device with a mere 128
gigs of storage that's kind of rough
with that said at least the i/o is
decent and the 48 watt hour battery had
no problem lasting all day with pretty
heavy use making the real question here
would I want to use this thing all day
if the answer we're going to be yes I
would start by attaching the $200 pixel
slate keyboard and then drowning my
regret in it's sort of rubbery felt
material like I don't know how to put
this other than that this thing is just
plain not good enough for the price the
palm rest for the keyboard is plastic
and it attaches to the back of the slate
with magnets but the magnets slip when
you're trying to maneuver the thing
making it feel just like kind of cheap
in the hand as you're as you're carrying
it around like it moves around and even
though once you've got it set up the
angle can be adjusted quite a bit with
the magnets locking it in place across
this whole range of motion the keyboard
it's just downer it's mushy with no real
tactile feel the round kind of weird
feeling key caps wiggle without actually
activating and the hinge well it's less
of a hinge so much as it's like kind of
a flap of material making it a hassle to
use the pixel slate when it's in your
lap now the trackpad is better it feels
nice and smooth and the multi-touch
gestures work well but unfortunately it
almost single-handedly defeats what was
left of the pixel slates lap usability
as slightly flexing the keyboard will
click the trackpad discovering which was
probably the single most WTF moment
during the creation of this review for
those of you who are one cake-baking
this whole situation even more confusing
is the fact that the Google store lists
the bridge g-type wireless keyboard
which is more of a traditional plastic
laptop keyboard on the Google store for
40 dollars less than the slate keyboard
and reviews of the bridge keyboard
almost unanimously recommend it over the
slate keyboard but anyway anyway anyway
it's a tablet right so let's change
gears here and talk about touch input
like what about the available $100 pixel
the pen yeah it's it's mostly cool it's
powered by a single quadruple a battery
and using it right after reviewing the
iPad pro with the Apple pencil did not
do this any favors it has a slightly
larger diameter so it felt kinda you
know novelty sized in the hand and
Google says that the pen has virtually
no leg but
I don't know I must just have like super
amazing eyes because I can pretty
clearly see the stroke trailing behind
the pen tip here and you guys probably
can too like it is not like the Apple
pencils I mean some of this probably
feels like nitpicking but to the kinds
of people who use styluses the stylized
iolite styling styluses it's actually
really important that it feel natural
now remember I said that the Apple
pencil experience was the most
compelling reason to consider the iPad
pro as a laptop replacement so the thing
is is that given that this is a
similarly priced solution why settle
then for anything but the best stylus
experience another issue is that there
is no way to attach the pen to the
tablet like you can put it in this
little groove I hate calling that a
stylus resting point it's kind of like
saying that this car has 10 cupholders
in it in my opinion they should have
just used that space to allow the
keyboard to snap up at an angle on the
screen like the surface keyboard so
that's the hardware all wrapped up how
about the software how about the
software ah yes Chrome OS it has
certainly made progress over the years
we're at the point now where with the
combined power of Chrome extensions and
Android apps you can actually do a ton
of desktop type stuff including file
management connecting external displays
and of course using the full desktop
version of the Chrome browser in
fairness to Google it is definitely more
of a desktop operating system than iOS
is the question though is is it just as
much of a full desktop OS as Windows or
Mac OS and the answer is no no no
what kind of stupid question is that of
course not Android apps
sometimes adjust welds being used in a
desktop environment but at other times
they act exactly like they do on your
phone which can be pretty disappointing
like it just doesn't seem right that I
had an easier time using Microsoft Word
on an iPad than I did on Chrome OS hey
who said that use whatever word
processor I want now to be fair Google
doesn't seem to be making the same
replace your computer argument that
Apple is with the iPad pro opting for
more of a work and play message but my
question in response to that is who
exactly is working and playing with this
the technology is cool and I understand
that the engineers that are behind
products like this are trying new and
cool things and that's important like
they might be thinking well we have
Android tablets or iOS tablets for that
matter and we also have laptops wouldn't
it be cool to combine these things to
blur the lines and the answer is yes it
is cool when it works well but when it
doesn't well the customers just gonna
find themselves mad that they're a beta
tester for a concept device that they
paid just as much for as they would have
paid for something that is frankly more
polished maybe the problem here is that
I'm just jaded I mean when you review as
many tech products as I do it becomes
easy to see the flaws and after using
device after device after device often
times at the end of the day I just want
something that just works well and does
what I expect it to in an emergency if
I've got a throw together a couple video
clips having some options for video
editing program I mean the things
available with up to a core i7 like I
should be able to do real work on it if
it comes to that
and it falls flat and maybe that
attitude sometimes prevents me from
recognizing the fact that the things I
hold in my hand on your screen are the
results of weeks months and even years
of work by talented engineers and
designers like they're out there trying
to create something that could be the
future of computing I just feel like
right now for my money I'm better off
with the present of computing rather
than a promise of what's to come the
iPad pro that has its own niche but like
how about this for a general-purpose
two-in-one a reasonable price sturdy
build quality a headphone jack maybe a
desktop OS a really good pen up maybe if
we had something like oh right
the surface pro we have that and yeah
the surface pro isn't perfect either but
what it is is a heck of a lot better
than this so maybe in another four years
