I am unboxing an oem hard drive but I
have a good reason for it this time
I promise you I do so I'm going to zoom
in and tell you a little bit about this
particular dry first of all it is a
Western Digital one terabyte drive and
you know I can I can see right now
saying whoa whoa whoa whoa well back up
we've seen this before but no this is
something new okay something is in back
in give you a closer look okay so this
is part of their Black Series and I know
you've seen this before but the special
thing about this particular Drive is
that it is SATA 3 or SATA 6 gigabits per
second compatible so that means that if
you have one of the newer boards
particularly a seuss and gigabyte have
released a lot of SATA 3 ready boards
then you can actually hook this up to
your SATA 3 controller now whether or
not you're going to see a huge
performance impact versus the older
Western Digital 1 terabyte black drive
is um not as clear but you shouldn't see
higher burst speeds ok and you will also
be able to run it on that controller now
something else that they've added with
this particular Drive is that it has a
64 made cache now I'm not sure if you're
going to be able to read that but right
about there it says it has a 64 made
cache and most of the other blacks have
a 32-bit cache so I have unbagged this
drive I'm going to dump out and do not
eat do not eat this wow it's even in a
bunch of different languages on this one
that's very um health conscious of
Western Digital to take care of that ok
so why don't we start with the front of
the drive this is the front of the drive
this is a standard three and a half inch
OM drive it doesn't include any mounting
screws or cables but what it does have
these holes to put mounting screws so
you can put one two three here one two
three here and that is how you will
mount the drive or you can mount it with
one two three four at the bottom at the
back of the drive you will find soon as
my cats want to help me unbox here look
do you like this
yeah it's hard drive okay why don't you
go on the floor thank you okay so at the
back you will find and I would normally
say say to power and SATA to data but
today I will say SATA three data so
there you go that is the biggest
difference between this and every other
one terabyte drive released by Western
Digital to date thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the WD 1 terabyte
