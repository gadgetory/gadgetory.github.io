over the last little pile here that that
ugly wall that turns my skin orange in
our videos is gone and it's been
replaced by our new set but what you
also might have noticed is that our new
set is super dirty well our friends at
Dyson noticed so they sent us over the
brand-new Dyson cyclone v10 so that we
can clean it up and take you guys for a
little tour of our new space so look
it's not how you're supposed to do that
lock and load and come along for the
ride we're gonna clean up and show you
guys around pass sounds like a ray gun
so let's start by meeting the v10 this
right here is the design that made James
Dyson look like like that James Dyson go
to his team and say you know what guys
all these other upright corded vacuums
blown up we're not gonna develop corded
vacuums anymore forget about it
this is it this is the future I mean
he's 70 and British so he probably
didn't say it quite like that but this
the sentiment is the same compared to
their last gen it's got longer battery
life up to 60 minutes of fade-free power
and thanks to the new digital motor that
spins at a whopping 125,000 rpm it even
provides 20% more suction than the v8
making it their fastest vacuum cleaner
motor to date and it accelerates to that
in just half a second 40% more capacity
in here it's got a one-piece cleanable
filter so you just pop that out run it
under the sink little kind of british
looking faucets on there it's also
easier to clean and you don't need much
force to open it up and do their thing
there yeah it's easy like that and of
course it includes a bazillion and one
accessories so let's get our tour
started let's go in let's go in handheld
mode here right let's start outside so
out here you can actually see some hints
of the old design
not bad so behind me other than the
green screen wall pretty much everything
has changed actually even the green
screen wall has changed if you look
closely enough so this used to go about
two three feet further that way but what
we actually had to do was cut the wall
off and then we took this wall right
here and like by actually like kicking
it over moved it about two to three feet
this way so the other side of this one
is what used to be that orange wall and
is now the inner wall of the living room
so we'll go in there in a minute but
first I want to show you guys what we're
doing with the outside so you can see
right there we changed our minds about
12-foot high walls and then we ended up
changing to 10-foot high walls so we
have just kind of like a weird thing you
can also see where the cable management
comes in there's networking running
right there in an armored conduit along
the roof because that allows us to avoid
the more complicated permitting process
for permanent structures so the idea of
doing exterior siding here which by the
way vertical siding is a thing that
people do was that if we wanted to do
like a you know honey I'm home type of
shot it wouldn't be immediately obvious
as long as we move that orb that we are
not in a real house look at all this
dust
also on the outside we've got a little
bit of storage so some lighting
equipment some you know pieces for
videos that we happen to be working on
right now and then in the longer term
what we actually want to do is turn this
into a somewhat convincing patio space
so we'd love to put down like some
artificial turf and maybe some kind of
nicer looking concrete and then be able
to kind of do shots like sitting outside
on the patio there's a fair bit of work
to be done lighting wise before we'd be
able to do that though so for now what
we generally do is you can see this
diffuser right here and then we will
just kind of blow enough light at them
that will will blow them out and it'll
kind of look like outdoors like you can
see an example of this on the window
with the blinds over there and the
window with the plants over there which
leads us to one of the other purposes
out here so we created ourselves a
little sort of forest back here so we
could actually allow ourselves to see
out into kind of a skybox like backdrop
with plants in front of it uh since
we're back here you can actually see a
couple of examples of ways that we like
the windows and then over on the other
side we've got the color temperature of
the light changed so that it looks more
like evening
Wow big choice wood no big deal so the
living room was actually probably the
most natural the easiest aspect of this
project we actually ended up doing two
different iterations of it now the
original plan had been to take so this
was the orange wall right here up where
it's 12 feet tall and then this was the
map wall which you guys will probably
remember the original idea was to take
these two walls and just convert them
and then maybe expand a little bit over
to where that spaceship thing was in the
other corner so Yvonne set out to just
do a makeover so we just changed the
color we ripped the map off we got a
couple shelves and it made such a
difference to the feel of the videos
that we kind of realized well this is
what we got wrong we spent a bunch of
money but ultimately we ended up with
something that didn't look homey you
know it didn't have pictures on the
walls it didn't have you know plants and
they're all things by the way plants and
knickknacks lying around this one
doesn't even have a pot what the heck
happened to the pot you guys oh that is
so cool look at this it's blue and red
now it's purple anyway so what we
realized was that you didn't have to do
like a crazy set we just had to build
something that felt more like a house so
that was where the idea came from why
don't we just treat our building like a
giant sound stage and actually build a
house inside it
this backing had glitter so then there
were just two main design goals here one
was that we wanted the media center to
look like cool and modern but also be
really versatile so it didn't really
matter what we put there and then number
two was that we wanted this this sitting
area hey fella go sit over there we
wanted the sitting area to look like a
place where you know people might
actually be sitting and hanging out
hello would hang out with me on his free
time right yeah
it should be noted that even stuff
that's relatively simple can be
complicated so check this out first I'm
gonna clean this windowsill
yeah babies so in order to avoid
reflections on the glass in our windows
they're actually installed to that on
like a gimbal mount so there's a
rotating post in the middle at the top
and the bottom that lets us reposition
them so that we can avoid reflections
when we have the blinds open which we
often don't just because like this looks
a lot more convincing you got shadows
and all that stuff then this so far
especially with like extension cords
running through our foliage here is this
one on a gimbal too white yes it is now
we we know the people that are living in
the in the old studio house still and we
know that they are planning a kitchen
Renault so we seriously considered
offering to buy all the hardware and
cabinetry from the old kitchen set and
install it here there were some things
about the old kitchen that really didn't
work that well so for example check this
out now whoa look at that
we actually modified an up desk so that
we could have a height-adjustable island
which is really great when we're
shooting b-roll like honestly some of
the stuff we did in the old kitchen like
build guides was really really difficult
because of the fixed height of this and
then the other thing was that it doesn't
have to be a real kitchen like this it's
not a real sink which doesn't prevent
people from dumping stuff down it which
is why we have these buckets here
because it's already happened a couple
of times but it's not a real sink so we
figured we could save some space in the
kitchen by taking out stuff we don't
need so like you might have noticed it
doesn't have a fridge no fridge so then
over on this side
honestly like there wasn't much of a
plan for the dining room and everything
over here
yeah like I think we've I think we've
shot here a couple times but that's it
this mostly just kind of collects dust
because we can't really shoot out this
door in spite of its cool magnetic
closing mechanism just because we'd be
going out into kind of ugly warehouse
land and you know just looking at a
double door that's closed over it
doesn't look that amazing so if we were
ever shooting you know out of the
kitchen across here or something it
wouldn't look stupid over there it would
look like we were like we were in a
house anyway one of the areas that we
intended to use a lot more than the
dining room was this over here so this
was meant to be kind of like a reading
nook it's little details like this that
you'll never really notice in the videos
but if you look close most of these
pictures are LMG staff often me either
dressed really funny like wrapped in
cables or wearing you know VR headsets
or dressed in drag so we've got colton
and drag ed and drag is that Dennis that
is a creepy ass picture anyway having
something with death behind you this is
something that I think people who are
more familiar with filmmaking have
probably always known but something that
helps make stuff look more natural like
a lot so this corner is one that we use
a lot this one was intended for kind of
the more professional or creative type
products so things like you know a
laptop or an all-in-one PC or whatever
else it was meant to look like like a
place where you might actually work or
study but it's not the only desks that
we have in the set it's definitely the
dirtiest one because it gets the most
use but that's okay we have a solution
today yeah Davey
this is not actually the ideal head for
this but I guess it doesn't really
matter
picking everything up anyway now we're
gonna finish our tour in what is perhaps
the most over-engineered but well I
think engineering is a bit of a stretch
but whatever you get the point get get
get in here so this is the bedroom and
the idea here was again trying to
maintain the ability to shoot in any
direction and to do so we actually
designed this rolling built-in bookcase
so whether I'm sitting here next to this
picture or lying in the bed you know
hitting talking to a Google home or
whatever else or grabbing this vacuum
now with the tork brush bar head there's
really dirty in here Wow
the brush bar is actually doing a
bang-up job on here I can walk around
the entire room and it'll never feel
unnatural this is also where we put our
second desk the idea was that here is
where we would do like gaming monitors
and gaming systems and you know the more
performance type stuff so it's the work
over there and then game over here now
something that you might notice in this
room as someone who is watching a
behind-the-scenes tour is that it
doesn't really have a door this was
intended to be the closet so this is one
of those sliding style doors so behind
it there's a couple of things one is
there's an emergency exit in the event
that someone is in here and that a hump
that built-in bookcase is closed
and two is actually access to the plant
area that I showed you guys before so
this is the way that we can get around
behind the stage so to speak I love
carpet like I love the feeling of carpet
but the amount of just dust that it
gathers is really horrible it's actually
kind of impressive how light this thing
is
this is on minimum to like it picked up
that giant chunk of chunk of stuff on
the minimum power setting the main point
Dyson's trying to make with this thing
is that they don't really see the
purpose in continuing to develop
inconvenient corded vacuums when you can
build something like this that does such
a good job and is quick to just grab and
go and run anywhere with whatever
attachment you want like the fact that
it converts from a full-size to a
portable like that is absolutely
incredible so they're just saying okay
you know what forget it we're just not
going to invest in those other vacuums
anymore and I can totally see where
they're coming from so guys you can
check out the v10 at Dyson Canada
dossier or Dyson com we're gonna have
that linked in the video description and
a huge shout out to you guys for
watching I hope you enjoyed our tour of
our new sets I hope you learned a little
bit about the behind-the-scenes magic I
know I actually did while we were doing
this over a couple things I actually
haven't noticed about with the sign
until now and uh we will see you guys
again don't forget to subscribe like all
that good stuff
check that okay how clean is the
workshop floor now you could eat off it
like a savage all right let's get this
dust out of here check this out gently
not by like you just press that button
