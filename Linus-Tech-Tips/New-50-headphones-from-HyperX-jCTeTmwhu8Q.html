West 2016 this year check out their
Blade stealth in the link of the video
description down below at the HyperX
booth today we're going to be checking
out two products first of which will be
the cloud as stinger it's a $49 headset
which feels like something that is not a
$49 headset in a good way it feels nice
it has memory foam padding it is a
flexible boom mic which mutes when you
put it up to the top it has volume
control on the bottom of the right ear
cup and it has 50 millimeter neodymium
drivers
there's no RGB lights there's none of
all that crazy flashy weird stuff it's
just a very solid headset for $49 it has
a 4-pole connection so it works on your
phone you can work on your PC we're
going to Xbox one can work on a
PlayStation 4 whatever you want and then
next up we have the alloy FPS which is
probably one of the thinnest mass
production keyboards I have ever seen
actually I think it is the thinnest mass
production keyboard I've ever seen comes
with cherry MX blues my personal
favorites which I'm going to decide that
they just made this keyboard for me and
literally no one else but you can buy it
in the US as of 10/10 that's the 10th of
October that is 5 different lighting
modes including wave and reactive which
are my personal favorites there's no
like crazy media Keys or extra stuff
like that there is a pass-through but
not for data just for power so you can
like charge your phone or something like
that if you'd like the top plate is
alloy so you can feel the cool metal on
your hands and it has a detachable cable
which you can pull out and then put in
its little travel bag which is pretty
cool
and if you want to swap out the WASD and
one two three and four keys they have
those for you in the bag along with a
key puller
let me know what you guys think of these
products down below the general design
philosophy seems to be cutting the fat
taking away things that you don't need
the headphones are nice and cheap but
have good drivers nice memory foam
volume control all that kind of stuff
the keyboard doesn't have excess buttons
and it's nice and thin anyways let me
know what you guys think down below
thanks to the Razer stealth laptop team
for bringing us here to PAX West 2016

million subscriber giveaway where we're
going to give away a custom modded Razer
Blade stealth that has this really cool
design on it made by r1 and Oh Ned's
Ayako so check that out video
description down below it's nice laptop
