retro styled like typewriter II keyboard
the only real options were to convert an
old typewriter which we have done or by
custom keycaps and replace all the ones
on your current keyboard but now there
are actually a fair number of
off-the-shelf options for these
typewriter e keyboards so let's try
something out today shall we and this
whole endeavor is gonna be brought to
you by Oh doesn't drop it memory Express
memory expresses uber price beat
guarantee will beat any authorized
Canadian retailers price by 10% of the
difference check out the link below to
learn more
so we actually don't quite have as many
options today as it might at first
appear because some of them are just
different variants of the retro classic
from SEO so they've got the artisan the
posh the onyx and the Elwood and the
first thing that comes to mind for me
looking at this is are there really so
many people out there that are looking
for these style of keyboards that they
need for different colors so let's go
ahead and get these unpacked table feels
nice
so they're Oh how to impress Linus that
is a type-c connector which I actually
found out recently is only a cost
difference of about 15 cents over a
high-quality micro B connector but for
some reason many new products still
haven't switched over to it
couple of things back here so there's
bluetooth mode there's USB mode and you
can switch between Mac and PC
all right well part of the video today
is definitely gonna be rolling through
all the different color options here
because if you're the kind of person who
buys a stylish keyboard then surely you
do care about the color scheme a fair
whack so not only can you switch between
Apple and Windows modes they've actually
included a bunch of additional key cabs
this must be the Mac version of the F
keys all right now let's have a look at
what the artisan has to show for itself
this is actually a perfect example of a
company leveraging what little tooling
work they've done to turn that into as
many models as possible so you can
actually see here that the artisan is
just a cross between the Onyx and the
posh so it's got exactly the same kind
of rose gold metal accents and then it's
just using the faux leather backing and
then they a matte black infill for the
keycaps bringing us finally to the
Elwood which is different from every
other model that we have in much every
way actually so for one this thing hat
this has what appears to be a genuine
wood backing is it really no way feels
like it hey James James I think he's up
for lunch that's okay there's another
finishing touch on this one though
that's pretty cool so you actually have
the ability if you want to replace the
plate here
so you can undo the screws and I wonder
if you could flip it around and grab it
yourself
either way they sent a custom one with
their impressive established 2009 retro
classic and they still screen blinds
media on there that's cute I am in my
last name Sebastian not media but
alright these are really freaking heavy
keyboards how much of these things these
are not cheap I think they're gonna have
to do a lot more than look cool but
let's get to that in a minute first
let's have a look at the Challenger this
is the no K so is that like the opposite
of okay like it's then this is the no K
wryneck with blue switch gorgeous light
effect retro style and Bluetooth / wired
dual mode now the packaging isn't as
good I don't know what the deal is with
this like gradient Brown whenever I find
tape on packaging I have to know what's
under it well that's fine if cherry is
OEM in your keyboard that's not
embarrassing maybe some of our clever
Chinese viewers can give me some idea of
what that's about
without the tape on it I actually would
have had a lot more confidence going
into
looking not too bad to start so they've
got a little aluminum something they've
got a little more different alumina oh
this is like your like your stopper
thing for that okay it's not going to
have much of a function on a keyboard
but it might look kind of neat
and then we've got the keyboard itself
yeah I will say this the the feel of the
plastics here doesn't hold a candle to
the retro classic oh I was gonna say
though what's good is that they've got
these reinforcing ridges here so that
when you slide them into the slot you
can't put strain on the can and they
don't do anything they just borrowed
someone else's dueling for the USP
character wait there's two why does it
have to so this seems to go in here oops
No does this come off it's like a little
handle here but it doesn't seem to come
off don't even get after me about ped
kak because there's no manual that's it
going this way and it what it just sits
there oh that's it that's the whole
mechanism why do we even have these
holes on it okay
that - it doesn't secure in any way it
just sits there
oh IndieGoGo to think that this thing is
this thing that it holy crap this thing
raised three hundred and sixty thousand
dollars
what Duff it's almost two hundred this
costs almost as much as the a co 1u
retro keyboard people not only are there
more of you than I thought you guys are
guys are nuts
my switches are these they're covered by
the backplane here I can't tell what
they are also these lighting effects are
really annoying there we go now they're
breathing now they're just scattered
around now they're breathing well
they're not cherry you know how I know
that you hear how different the sound is
between those two okay so what the big
oh you have got to be kidding me
there's a pad look so there's a little
rubberized pad here presumably to keep
whatever you put on there safe but it
doesn't touch it so I guess this is part
of its jam is you can be sitting at your
computer and you can have your phone I
mean it says it has bluetooth but how do
you even you know what forget it for now
how great its bluetooth is is not
important unless it's actually decent
for a techie so let's find ourselves a
typing test holy crap that does not bode
well look at the wobble on these key
caps I'm barely touching them you know
what let's start with a baseline so this
is a razer blackwidow something-or-other
with their orange switches which are
basically Chinese clones of Cherry MX
browns okay
73 adjusted words per minute now it
should be borne in mind that these ones
get every advantage now because I'm more
familiar with the text hmm oh boy I
can't get a little mentum not the same
score
dang I'm consistent let's try it one
more time okay this one is more
representative of probably what I can do
but we're gonna go back to the razor in
a moment critiques of this guy these key
caps are wobbly the shape of them is
absolutely awful
pardon my french because it's very easy
to accidentally match two keys at a time
this one on the other hand actually not
a terrible amount of wobble a little bit
more than I'd like but the spacing
between the keys means I wasn't
accidentally hitting multiple keys at
once but I did have a hard time
registering keystrokes from time to time
because the switches they're using which
I'm actually not sure what they are I'll
have to find that out but the switches
they're using are a little bit on the
heavy side for me okay so they're kale
some kind of kale blues let's go back to
the first keyboard
all right
97 actually let's try out the Bluetooth
functionality first so I just flipped
this over to Bluetooth mode and what I'm
hoping is it's gonna be significantly
simpler to pair okay I'm holding
function and it starts flashing that's
weird there we go
that's intuitive so function and the
Bluetooth key has it come up okay
it's kind of a drag though that the
switch is located in such an
inconvenient spot what's cool though is
apparently it has a six thousand
milliamp hour battery so you can
continue to use it in Bluetooth mode you
don't want it's not plugged in so it's
wireless to
I'm backlit not bad that helps a lot
with the cost now this guy on the other
hand not impressed so I wouldn't go as
far as to say that either of these as a
replacement for a more standard keyboard
for me but I was surprised and impressed
by how close I was able to get on the
Ezio retro classic especially in light
of how apparently desperate the keyboard
community is to get their hands on some
kind of retro styled keyboard because
this is how much this product managed to
raise on IndieGoGo so I'm not strongly
recommending either but I will say that
if you need to buy one definitely go
with this one something I can recommend
