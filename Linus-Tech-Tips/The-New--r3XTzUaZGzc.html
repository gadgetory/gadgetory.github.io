possible for us this year check them out
in the link below this is the most
beautiful TV I have ever seen but not
just because of the 4k HDR display and
somehow higher brightness and wider
color gamut than before with 25% higher
peak brightness in certain situations
and 99% DCI p3 color standard my
favorite feature is what LG is calling
picture on wall or wallpaper display
this LG signature oled TV w is only 2.5
7 millimeters in depth and it is mounted
on the wall using a steel plate and
magnets to accomplish this they've moved
the brains in the processing power into
their 4.2 Channel Dolby Atmos powered
sound bar which features four HDMI ports
on the back along with three USB ports
optical in Ethernet and rs-232 for
control another great feature of the
sound bar that's outside of the
awesomeness of the speakers or the
subtle ribbon cable that can either run
up the wall behind your TV or be managed
behind the wall is just how nice it is
when you turn it on or turn it off
there's these two top speakers on the
outside and they will either lower into
the unit and then closed off or what I'm
assuming is dust protection or when you
turn it on they will raise up out of the
unit while it plays these pleasant tones
so the panel looks amazing 4k HDR Dolby
vision all that great stuff the sound
bar sounds fantastic four point two
channel Dolby audio but none of this
stuff can be translated very well
through YouTube or basically any other
online media distribution platform you
need to experience it in person so
hopefully looking around at LG here
hopefully we will get one in office
because I know Linus has probably been
chomping at the bit to actually see this
and I beat them to it and I'd like to
check it out with some gaming titles on
it there are two versions of this TV a
77 inch that will be available in the
second half of this year and this guy a
65 inch that will be available in early
March at 7,900 $99.98 which we'll be
able to find at some select Best Buy
locations again thanks to D brand for
bringing us to CES 2017 this year do you
want to see their stuff check out the
link down below or look right here
because I have a deep brain scan on my
phone we also all have D brand skins on
our
laptops I went with a purple and black
theme with mine because it's razor so
it's purple black and green it kind of
looks like the Joker
but whatever you can configure whatever
you want through their configurator and
make your device look unique to you so
again check them out in the link below
and I'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
