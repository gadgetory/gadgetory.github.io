the swift tech H 220 this is by you have
any accounts that we've seen the next
generation in all-in-one CPU coolers
because this bridges the gap in a true
way between a regular all-in-one which
is what we've seen in the past so the
original all-in-one was kind of the ASA
tech LC LC where it's prefilled
pre-sealed non-expandable it was kind of
tricky to install in terms of the
mounting hardware in that other stuff
and this bridges the gap between that
that prefilled easy to install
relatively you know you don't have to
replace it thing and a truly custom loop
so it comes in an eco-friendly packaging
you've got cardboard here and just as
that guys will be right back so beyond
the eco-friendly packaging we move on to
what's included the first thing you're
gonna notice about this is it looks an
awful lot like something that I've
already done a video about before where
we actually check this out in the Swift
tech suite at CES and we pretty much
know how it's going to perform already
which is why I'm able to say something
like next generation in pre-dawn liquid
coolers because it has the horses to
back up the claims that Swift tech is
making about this unit so how does it
function as a straight all-in-one well
you've got the mounting hardware not
only included but actually pre attached
for Intel and then they include the
mounting hardware that you need for AMD
so here we've got just a powder coated
screw based mechanism so that'll go into
presumably the the back plate that's
included with your AMD motherboard so
those are using very very rugged
mounting springs it's Swift tech does
such a good job of their mounting
mechanisms so these look like all you
got to do is what yeah I fixed them here
and then screw them in so okay now let's
move on to the included ones so this
covers pretty much any Intel mounting
mechanism
that you'd encounter whether at 775 1155
1156
and 2011 with the only changes being you
would have to change out the screws here
for 2011 due to the different mounting
pressure and the different threads
compared to the included backplate that
is used for all of the other sockets now
one of the first things I notice about
the block itself I didn't have much
hands-on time with it when I was in the
suite at CES is how freely these joints
rotate it's very very nice to see
because normally they're stiff now the
way these joints work is they have to
stay sealed no matter what kind of
pressure you're putting on it from this
direction or that direction they're
swiveling on the radiator as well they
go all the way around on the radiator so
they have to stay sealed and they have
to also not put any additional strain on
the fitting which can cause it overtime
to leak so having them so flexible like
that just means that you're not going to
run into any difficulty with that one of
the most important design differences
between this and Swift Tech has done
previous sort of all-in-one liquid
coolers like their Drive series is that
it uses a swift Tec designed and
manufactured pump so unlike what
everyone else is doing where they're
pretty much oh Yemen through kulit or
Ace attack or I believe coolermaster
also manufactures their own Swift Tec is
now a manufacturer of pumps not a
rebrand air pump sole in the past Swift
Tec even was using leg for the pumps for
their all in one liquid coolers so now
you find a completely redone design all
by Swift Tec with a swift Tec baseplate
a swift Tec pump swift tech design
fittings and special tubing and even
hold downs for the tubing itself so
check out this hold down here they're
using a custom sort of like a worm drive
clamp where you've got a very slight
bulge right here so you can see the lip
on the fitting itself and the way that
the clamp actually fastens down all the
way tight so you don't really have to
think about the way that you're mounting
it so that it will form a perfect seal
not over tighten and not under tighten
so it can't actually go anywhere but the
thing about this is it uses a standard
Phillips head so if you wanted to
clearly labeled in and out on the other
side presumably nope just the inlet is
labeled so if you wanted to you can act
remove this and plumb it up to a
completely custom water loop which is an
option that the existing products on the
market don't really have because you
can't really drain them you can't really
refill them this one has a drain plug on
the radiator itself it has completely
removable tubing with fittings that can
be reused with other industry standard
3/8 inch tubing and reusable clamps so
that you don't have to worry about sort
of damaging in any way I actually did
empty and refill a generation 1 LC LC
but it was a bit of a bear so the drain
plug is here on the radiator so the
radiator has a built-in sort of extra
part here that's kind of a reservoir it
has a little bit of extra room in it so
it's not a ton of extra fluid but it'll
be pretty much all you'll need so if you
were gonna drain it you just take the
whole thing and go like this pretty much
after you open up the drain plug you
want to refill it you refill the whole
thing with it oriented like this get it
as full as you can and there you go
you've actually refilled it so if Tek
also takes things a step in the right
direction I believe by pre installing
the fans on the radiator itself in the
orientation where they expect you to use
it they also include the screws that you
need to mount the here we go which ones
are these I haven't looked closely at
this yet but it looks like yeah to mount
the radiator directly to the case
so in that case remember guys these
fittings up here swivel around
completely
so to mount the radiator directly to the
case or to mount duh flip this around
the fans directly to the case whichever
you prefer you want to use it as an
inlet or an outlet that is totally up to
you and the fact that the fans are
pre-installed and you just screw the
screws into the fan plastic housings
themselves rather than all the way
through as a bolt through to the
radiator just means that you don't have
to we've all gone through this
installing these pre done liquid coolers
where you hold this in place and you
align the fan and then you thread the
screw and you're trying to get it in
they also have their own custom fans
installed on here so these are fully
sleeved look absolutely gorgeous in fact
let's get a close-up of the of the
sleeve miss there PWM 4-pin fans and
based on the performance and noise
characteristics that we saw in the Swift
tech suite at CES I am expecting these
fans to be just freakin awesome I mean
you
tell the way that they're designed
they're optimized for pressure not
necessarily for free airflow but that is
exactly the application that they're
being used in although this radiator
does use a fairly like not a super-dense
fin arrangement so it is optimized for
quiet operation as opposed to being
optimized for extreme performance with
like Delta fans on it for example now
I'd be remiss if I didn't do the
obligatory finger shot of the base I
mean Swift X been doing water blocks for
as long as pretty much anybody else out
there so they do know a thing or two
about designing a water block I think
and - or - about precision manufacturing
them and a thing or two about making it
difficult to remove the plastic covering
until you've actually unscrewed the base
plane so there you go I'm just gonna go
ahead and show you guys how reflective
that surface is I mean remember
reflectivity is not necessarily an
indication of performance but how you
got that diesel yeah he says he's got it
but it can't hurt Swift deck also
includes a high quality thermal compound
this looks like a shin-etsu tube but I
actually have no way of knowing for sure
it can also be an MX derivative of some
some some sort I mean most of the
thermal compounds out there are sort of
a few different brands but swift echo
showed me this is one of the better ones
out there and I think that pretty much
covers it in terms of the unboxing so
what's good about this in the Swift tech
booth they had their custom pump running
not only the CPU block and the radiator
that was included but also additional
blocks such as graphics card blocks or
even a built in water block like
something you might find on a Maximus 5
formula which we happen to have over on
the test bench over there with slicks
empty drink glass next to it way to go
slick mind you he didn't know we were
gonna point the camera over there so you
can actually plumb up additional blocks
they had an additional radiator running
through it and it was still holding up
just fine that's the reason why the
other manufacturers don't want you to
expand your pre-done liquid cooling loop
because the pump isn't capable of
powering it well this one can and it
actually runs off of a four pin pwm
connector
speaking of fan connectors Swift tech
also includes this guy right here which
is freakin sweet
so this is actually an eight-way so
channel one is labeled and got a red
little thing on it so this is actually
an eight-way pwm fan splitter what it
does is you just plug in molex power and
then you plug it up plug it into a PWM
fan controller for monitoring and you
can hook up up to eight fans and just
run them all somewhere in your case I've
seen this included on cases there I'm
gonna give a close-up for diesel to have
a look at I've seen this included on
cases like the phantom 630 from NZXT but
Swift tech figures well why should that
be tied to a case go ahead strap it to
something screw it into something not
those screws different screws these
screws screw it into something whatever
you want hook up all your fans to one
place because it makes it easier for
monitoring and controlling thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the Swift tech h2 twenty prefilled
prefabbed pre-installed almost with the
fans on there liquid cooling system stay
tuned guys we are going to do a
performance review on this one in our
standard test bench and see how it
stacks up all way from Swift Tech's
testing setup although based on how
closely I looked at their testing setup
I think we're gonna get pretty much the
same results but hey that's what
third-party validations for don't forget
