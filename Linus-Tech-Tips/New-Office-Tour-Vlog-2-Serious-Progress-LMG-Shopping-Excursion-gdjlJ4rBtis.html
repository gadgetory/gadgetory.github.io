office vlog this is part two there's
been some serious progress but more
importantly right now we are going
shopping
we're gonna hike it yeah thanks for the
delayed response thank you for tuning in
or we could just go to the casino if you
like screw it we'll just leave the
office for Elijah below we should bet
the new office ascend the mortgage no
way okay pathetic yeah we should totally
do it we put the entire net worth of the
company on one yes
auto rental red are you crazy it's black
it's black or nothing
and as you can tell Luke's batteries on
his pack are dead so we're gonna start
by picking up some batteries
sure so we've got a special helper with
us today howdy doc to
what tom is tattoo oh you does that it's
peeling yeah Oh bummer
okay that's one unit to Biden full yeah
you're buying in quads this the slowest
hump ever this is a 3-1 right so there's
a two and a three actually
he's a pig's I don't know if this one
actually wall mounts this is it's the
best option yes
what about for Brandon
oh yeah specifically an AV Kurt that's
cool he wasn't sure what it was called
but it turns out it's actually made for
Brandon we can move yeah so these these
are the bookshelves that we have that we
already have yes yeah yeah we have three
okay what are they for
I don't know but well I had kind of
forgotten we even had them because oh
wait these aren't the ones that are in
the office are they they are okay is
there India they just don't look the
same just cuz we have we have one that's
white and then we have two that are like
this right yes okay so two of them are
in the old set yeah and then ones in
Nick's office
none of which actually have anything
useful on nope so okay next fiction all
right so these are the desk organizers
that we decided to get they were like
half the price of ones on Amazon and
like as far as I can tell they're
exactly the same thing yeah so everyone
gets one of these
yeah he's nice and then this I actually
picked up one of these because I thought
it's got a quirk surface on the bottom
so I don't know flash drives he can use
like whatever you could just have and
you can kind of see into it anyway I
might give this to Nick though if you
end up liking the thing that I'm gonna
show you in a couple minutes okay we
need to go to the bathroom for that so
just kidding
all right this is this is the money
right here I think this guy right here
it's like way more expensive than I'd
like but no it doesn't come with the
bells boat no it doesn't come with any
of those belts it does not come with the
pink boxes well it really doesn't go
with the plastic uh you can buy the
plastic organizers so and not the felt
so we'll get something else like some
kind of a rubber thing cut it to size
see it's just yeah it's just sitting in
here in fact we could just flip this
over yeah and then you know you can put
these look like the perfect size for
like a couple memory sticks CPUs
whatever and then it's all totally
modular all the way to the top it goes
almost to the like the height of the
ceiling by the time you put something on
top of it you could store all our CPUs
and all our like memory in like you know
a couple of use worth of storage space
and then you just get a bunch of these
glass-fronted ones and do whatever it is
you're doing they're like I think that
looks like probably five or maybe six if
you pack them tight and other boards
even now you've seen this so you know
it's not it's stupid good oh yeah are
you learning to shop
you're gonna regret teaching I won't
need to teach her Oh basketball room
yeah like if we could feel like a
medium-sized swimming pool with these
babies like them see she doesn't seem
that sold on it okay forget it then
Oh can I interest you in a small baby
okay well I guess that's it so uh let's
head to the office next okay all right
so we're here we get to check out the
progress on the new office
this'll actually be Luke's first time
seeing it with stuck inside I think whoa
what just fell out of my car
Oh what could this be guys you're
probably gonna want to drop a like on
the video if you want to see us bench
the crap out of this pretty shortly what
we got going on in there oh don't look
too close don't look too close all right
let's go outside I did drop it so I
guess I'm showing you around as much as
I'm showing anyone else around
so these whoops these are all the
pallets for the reclaimed wood wall
behind one of the sets so they'll need
to be disassembled one-by-one and have
things done to them do you know what I
mean
over here we have some like relics and
stuff there we go
oh no we're the worthless this is worth
the absolute crap got beat out of our
walls so this is where I put up combs
and ropes so people hopefully will not
beat up the walls again they have since
been touched up and repaired
well the touch-up repaired wall ever
looked like them no it will not so we're
always stuck with that but at least it's
all covered we just like spray painted
gray or something I don't know I kind of
give up on it being perfect yep this is
the server room we've had more
electrical circuits added since the last
time I talked to you guys about it
this is network wiring for security as
well as for people to have network
cables for their pcs this is where the
cabinet is gonna go right here i-it'll
thin yeah it'll be fine because it
doesn't have to go right back to the
back anyway we've got all this space how
many use are we putting in it now I
don't add a lot like 25 to 30 I don't
think it'll be quite full yet here's
where they're pulling out parts of the
concrete slab in order to do plumbing
and whatnot so it turns out we did find
the budget for an indoor bathroom
solution the employees complained it
having an outhouse outside was
apparently quote unquote completely
unreasonable yeah I can't remember
exactly what the wording they used was
something along those lines benchmarking
den and editing room other than adding
more electrical haven't been changed
much oh but there is a small improvement
the editing room now has a window out
into the warehouse so we have also added
three windows in the library so we'll
actually get a little bit of natural
light in the library so it doesn't feel
quite as much like a dungeon in here
this box apparently they're going to put
back in at some point so that'll be good
oh wow that's a very heavy looking
implement thank you for not hitting me
with it this conduit right here is
actually where our fiber is going to be
coming in down
they're gonna get it like up to here
somehow and then over to something
anyway this is this is where that ball
and fiber line comes in and me upstairs
is yes actually that is a plan so the
upstairs is no longer completely open
concept in fact I can really show you
guys around so right here is going to be
the conference room so this is where
we're going to have like a boardroom
table with probably about six to seven
chairs and that'll be the people into
the bathroom downstairs they said they
wanted an indoor bathroom not a private
indoor bathroom so Big Brother man
we are going to drywall kind of up over
this and turn this into that oh no put
like something there something whatever
cell phone reception is not very good so
up on the roof we're going to be putting
an antenna with booster antennas inside
the roof and inside the building here
this is my office
so this was also really expensive adding
windows overlooking the linus Media
Group empire but I figured it was worth
it and in fact I was so benevolent that
I also added windows overlooking the
Linus Media Group empire for the entire
rest of the floor I realized walking
around in here the first time that this
place was going to be a total aquarium
except without windows so basically just
a hole and I figured we needed to fix
that so that people wouldn't feel quite
as confined so yeah well just the
editors and the benchmarking done just
some people who currently work here we
got to attract new talent somehow here
is an office I'm trying to convince my
wife to work for us so if I maybe
promise her this office maybe she'll
maybe she'll come work here this is a
window out into the open concept sort of
area and I believe there will also be a
window in this door so more windows just
trying to make things still really open
this is almost exactly the same size as
my old office at NCIX so this one will
be desk here this is very likely where
mr. Nick Lite will end up with his team
of cronies kind of out out kind of here
somewhere
so I don't know how much else there is
to say here this is where the firemen's
pole would go if we were stupid enough
to put a fireman's pole in we're not
putting a fire pole here why not
who cares no we could totally do it well
I know what we could do we're not don't
you like the video if you want a
fireman's pole to go in by the stairs
imagine how cool every single video
could be you can intro every single
video coming down the fireman Pole would
be like your thing I'm sure there is one
we can look it up okay so we're back at
the yeah okay so I guess the last big
update today is our new ba-ba storage
server and I know I've done this a
couple times already but guys go ahead
let us know what the like if you want to
see a dedicated video about our new
surveillance system server here it
actually looks even cooler than it
actually is like this thing is actually
kind of sick and check this out there's
like a software suite here that has
cameras and stuff which makes sense
because it's a surveillance server other
than that I think that's pretty much it
guys thanks for watching if you disliked

do but if you liked it go ahead and
