audio show yeah the show that as long as
you do not have daylight savings time is
still half an hour early heck yeah yeah
oh man we we don't we don't operate in
these confines of localized ideas of
time yeah you know man like you know
time is like you know really it's just a
measure of like the Sun you you just
think it's this time cuz the man tells
you yeah so we're telling you what time
it is it's when show time
and when show time happens when a wizard
decides that it arrives anyway a Mac OS
finally supports EGP use / Thunderbolt 3
nice the Exynos model Galaxy S nines
apparently are significantly worse than
the Snapdragon ones which sort of runs
counter to what we had talked about on
the show a little while ago or it seemed
like Samsung was gonna be nerfing the X
and O's ones yeah so we'll get into that
a little bit more later but else you got
Apple releases iOS eleven point three to
absolute critical acclaim no not
necessarily we'll see we'll see you
later
they're not necessarily against it
either it's just not the most exciting
thing in it AMD strikes back at GPP
which is brand-new never heard before
news no one had any idea that AMD was
against GPB at all that's really in true
fake news show how much of that donut
did you just consume like actually like
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
okay well we oh that's good yes the
wrong lower third now this is the part
where I smile it is the wrong lower
third no you clicked oh yeah thanks
anyways alright so I made it the big
news this week is of course about us oh
we broke up we broke up with fennel
berry apparently we have already got an
email from one of sun'll bears
co-founders yep that is pretty upset and
I don't know I'm not gonna go into I
mean I'm not gonna say anything that you
guys couldn't probably assume but what I
will say is that we stand behind
everything we said we asked them for
comments we gave them two weeks or three
weeks two weeks I think we gave them two
weeks till I wasn't sure if we were
saying that part but that's pretty
important in my opinion we gave them a
couple weeks to get back to us and be
like yo here's our plan to make sure
that none of this is a concern we did
not hear back from them yep and I've
used P ia in the past we have other
people here on staff that have been
using it actually some of them for quite
some time because I used both
concurrently total bear I liked because
it was just so fast it was really like
to get going yes that's true but then
any more long-term installations I used
to be a a4 so you know every everything
has a place and P is place is in our
video descriptions and tunnel bears
is figuring out how to explain selling
to McAfee yeah I mean and as I said in
the stream so I'm just kind of I just
want to reiterate for anyone who didn't
watch the stream today as I said we
actually don't we're not aware of any
huge problems that will arise due to
this acquisition honestly we don't know
that anything will change or go wrong or
be bad or anything like that what we do
know is that it gave us and many members
are of our community reason to doubt
that things would continue to be status
quo and fine and that we couldn't get a
comment from them for a couple of weeks
so we kind of went well let's look look
at the other options and being who we
are it was not hard to get VPN services
to return our phone calls you know
knowing what the endorsement of our
community does for a particular service
they were like yeah we want to talk yet
yeah house now how about now yeah so
that was a big thing and yeah so there's
some third you know there might be some
frustration on tunnel there side and
we're kind of our story for that but the
flip side of it is that just you know we
have to when you go through the internet
moves first when when you go through
something like an acquisition people
need answers like right away and when
it's something as serious as your online
privacy especially with some crap that's
been happening Leon oh yeah yeah things
like that there's no waiting around for
a month to hear back if the service that
our viewers are using is like still cool
oh ok or not yeah um all right so why
don't we jump into our first FS in the
chat for the time bear sponsorships
really speaking of tunnel bear
sponsorships after favors bad probably
get banned by the bots so don't it's
only for 20 seconds at a time but look
at that ha
why did you encourage them why was he
watching the bots just like just covered
Karnas like it's not even a ban how I
think they overpowered it it's a bad
steamer I'm not even kidding
did the bot crash no wait no maybe it's
turned off or maybe yeah maybe maybe
it's temporarily off alright oh so okay
let's jump into our first first first
like external topic for the day yeah
this was posted by vegetable stew on the
forum and the original article here is
from MacRumors booth looks a little
something like that Apple releases Mac
OS High Sierra 10 dot 13.4 with a GPU
support and this is actually pretty
exciting for a couple of reasons number
one is that I'm excited to finally be
legitimately excited about thunderbolt
ports on the MacBook Pro and on the iMac
Pro because I initially saw the iMac
pro-animal Wow
it's got Thunderbolt ports that means
that even though it's like a lockdown
sealed up Apple product the most
important part of it that might need to
be upgraded within the next I'd say
three to four years is that can actually
be upgraded it's the GPU yeah so the
iMac pro if it supports the GPU can have
its RAM its storage I mean with some
difficulty of course but it's Ram its
storage and its CPU upgraded to up to an
18 core processor up to i think its 256
gigs of ram so on which is a lot only
four sticks so you gotta buy little
really high density modules but so you
can do it but but you can do it and then
it's got I forget it's either wanted to
SSD slots but I mean honestly a machine
like that's got 10 gig Len you should be
using a high performance NAS for your
bulk storage anyway so it makes it like
a legitimately pro machine I was so
disappointed when I found out that the
iMac Pro didn't support EGP you unless
you booted into Windows so the hardware
was obviously there but Apple had it
turned off in Mac OS so it didn't
support you GPU unless you booted it in
to win
and I'm still disappointed about this
one it still doesn't support display
target mode or whatever they call that
target display mode so you can't
continue to use it as a monitor for your
like next generation
yeah iMac problems because it is
actually a really nice monitor that
would be nice
that would be super swell but here let's
have a look and see if there's sort of
anything else to add here so the rest of
the update includes support for business
chat conversations and messages in the
US whatever data seemed not being sort
of immersed in the Apple ecosystem I
actually don't know what that is maybe
there allows jumping to the right most
open tab using command 9 in Safari oh
boy ok Safari is so bad you know the one
thing that makes it completely unusable
for me is the fact that it doesn't
support favicons every tab is just gray
oh yeah so I like I can't tell what
anything is that's actually unusable for
me yeah but the number of tabs yeah you
became a tab mark I did I was so good I
corrupted I was so I wrapped it him it's
great like never beyond 5 I regularly
use like 25 to 35 gigs of ram with
chrome now I'm regularly yeah regular do
you don't even have an ultra-wide yet
either because let me tell you okay my
work computers of Walter roid and at
home I have three monitors okay okay you
know what's up yeah anyway so like it's
completely unusable for me what else we
got here you can sort Safari bookmarks
by name or URL
what are these updates these are up why
are they offering browser display
privacy icons and introduces a smoke
cloud wallpaper that was previously only
available on the an iMac what is some
more Safari stuff okay so let's focus on
the e GPU stuff because that is by far
the biggest thing about it the most
exciting so here here's the features you
can connect additional external monitors
or displays with your EGP you that's
pretty cool so not only being able to
connect additional displays because you
could do that already but being able to
dry
them off of a different GPU very cool
you can charge your MacBook Pro while
using EGP you so that's pretty cool if
you're into mobile yeah you can use an e
GPU with your MacBook Pro while the
built-in display is closed ok that I
probably would have mostly taken for
granted
you can connect more than one e GPU
using the multiple still Thunderbolt
three ports that's cool
yeah but any PC can do that too no I
know but like yeah and you can use
virtual reality headsets plugged into
the e GPU
they don't have favicons I know can I
give them credit for everything I know I
know what they can get I mean knowing
I'm sure I'm sure there are Mac people
in the chat that are like um actually
Linus there's on the on the App Store
you can actually get this thing in $7.99
and it'll add favicon I'm like or
everyone just did down was it for a
browser but everything on the Mac is
like that there's like a fix but it's
like like a seventeen dollar download or
whatever and it like fixes some of the
BS in finder and it's like yeah this
would probably be free on Windows and
Linux it would definitely be free people
are like next topic no no no this is a
big deal I was actually getting to the
sort of the the climax here so to speak
you can run an NVIDIA GPU on your Mac
yeah properly in a supported way because
up until now the only way to like NVIDIA
has Mac OS drivers they release them but
the only way to run a modern Nvidia card
would be to be using a Mac Pro from like
2013 or something or to be using a
hackintosh thanks Bigsby
I really wasn't talking to you right now
so I think this is gonna help a lot
actually because like the B MacBook Pros
have been really popular for a long time
especially for editing that's right and
now if you can yeah do some stuff on the
road but also dock it when you come home
and edit more heavily there that's right
I think that's actually really cool I
think that's fantastic and I mean not
just editing I mean you look at any GPU
accelerated workloads you know
whether it's a simulation or whether
it's rendering whatever the case may be
like if you want I actually don't know
if NVIDIA has Quadro drivers for the Mac
so don't quote me on this one but if you
had the ability to run a Quadro on Mac
OS and again I don't know if like
SolidWorks supports it yet or anything
like that the point is we're moving in
that direction and yes and choice is
always good in the same way that if you
are able to choose between AMD and
NVIDIA on a PC it is good that you can
choose between AMD and NVIDIA or for
your Apple experience too so that's the
thing that I'm most stoked on actually
this is this is interesting we've got
we've got someone asking why is it that
Apple only uses AMD this is from near
rut near rots of time I don't know I
don't know what that says people are
saying no Nvidia official support okay
so we'll give it we'll give it a little
we'll give it a little bit more time for
India GPUs to be officially people yeah
I was just going to say I think that's
gonna become a thing over time they are
do the first step but well I don't know
with Apple you never know they may
actually lock it down so something that
Alienware did is on their gaming
notebooks the ones that have the GPU
dock their proprietary connector on the
back they actually intentionally locked
out and I don't know if they're still
doing it but they intentionally locked
our Thunderbolt II GPUs oh and you know
it's intentional I think I talked about
this with like an alienware third team
review a little while back you can tell
it's intentional because contemporary
XPS models worked fine with the GPUs and
there was a specific error message that
said that this is that that Thunderbolt
GE GPUs are not supported on this model
and so it is possible that they would do
something like that so let's let's let's
sort of not put it past them but okay so
there seems to be some debate in the in
the comment in the comments here in the
twitch chat so which I was dead 1990
says Nvidia does offer official support
yes they do for their GPUs but what I
think people might be saying is that
Apple is not currently supporting NVIDIA
GPUs with
they're EGP you enabled necklace and and
I believe it would be possible for them
to allow or disallow so having not
actually tried it yet and right now our
I Mac Pro is still broken we have a
video coming on that very long story do
you know anything about this yeah okay
very frustrating stubble okay I haven't
heard an update in a while but I do I
know everything about the beginning it
hasn't gotten any less stupid okay okay
yeah it's still broken it's right there
are they still refusing that video
coming or but it's I mean it's it's
right there right there that's a super
broken broke dick screen on the front of
it so anyway
understood apparently they killed
thunderbolt to support okay sorry I
can't I can't
will you discuss the proof that Intel
cherry-pick CPUs for reviewers no
probably not
anyway because wait we like did a video
we showed filter I got you may okay
where was I going with this right right
right
um no actually I think yeah I'm Apple
news I think we're pretty good yeah yeah
it's a good thing the other thing yeah
we're excited we hope I'm quite
happening because I actually think like
especially you got us those blades hold
on hold that thought
yep why Apple only uses AMD there's a
bigger threat on the forum about this
this week we had someone asking in
twitch chat my my tinfoil hat theory I
don't think Apple's ever explicitly come
out and said this is why we straight-up
will not work with NVIDIA but I think in
Apple's mind Nvidia still owes them like
a billion dollars or something well
because do you remember that whole
scandal back in and must spin like 2012
2011 something like that way back when
Nvidia's again don't quote me on the
exact year the exact model but I believe
it was 940 MX graphics cards or 640
whatever it was it like an apple only so
I don't know if it was an Apple only
skew but basically what happened was in
video was doing on motherboard GPUs for
Apple that because of this problem with
the type of solder and the way that it
was soldered and the
way that that machine heated up and
cooled down they were basically the
solder joints were basically all failing
like actually all of them an apple at
some point ended up having to issue a
recall and they did not 860m people are
saying maybe it was the 860m yep so
Apple and NVIDIA to my knowledge did not
reach an amicable agreement about how
they were gonna cover the costs of that
recall hmm
since then to my knowledge we haven't
seen an Nvidia based machine out of
apple at all and so there's there's
people talking about how maybe NVIDIA
wants too much margin or maybe this or
maybe that or maybe Nvidia won't give
them the supply or whatever the case may
be I don't think it's any of that stuff
I think this is just actually tech giant
grudge match 2018 and I don't see how
they would ever resolve this because
frankly both of them are fairly um maybe
arrogant isn't quite the right word but
I know you mean they're both pretty my
way or the highway
yeah and pretty inflexible you know I
don't know I don't actually know they're
both big giants that expect everyone to
bend over for them yeah like now they're
angry at each other so and they're both
just kind of staring at each other
nothing's happening yeah so I think I
think Apple would actually build their
own GPU before they would put Nvidia
products in their products and it's it's
not even that crazy yeah like Apple has
the money to shut out anyone and NVIDIA
is basically printing money right now to
the point where they've got to kind of
sit there and go yeah we don't need you
you don't need Xbox
we don't need Playstation whatever we'll
just we'll keep selling we'll keep
selling Tesla's to data centers all day
have fun yeah yeah and so as long as as
long as neither of them has any reason
to check their ego I don't think this is
ever gonna get resolved and you
see like the way that they continue to
behave with NVIDIA snarkily providing
drivers from echo s your move I bet you
that pisses off Linux quite a bit
oh wow I never thought ok nothing that
you or I can do about any of that
no all right why don't we jump into our
next topic here this was originally
posted by diehard life diehard life I
can never read that just you it's too
leet-speak no never the original article
here is from a non tech and or die hard
lives maybe I don't know live live no
wait no I think you got it wrong I think
it's die hard to live yes die hard to
live yep ok we got this we got this we
can read your name uh Wow so contrary to
what we fought earlier I'm actually also
reading an article on a non tech it
looks like the s9 with the snapdragon
845 actually crushes the Exynos 9810
equipped phones in web browsing video
editing photo editing writing oh no
phone benchmarks really are very
confusing like you actually just have to
do it by device cuz like look at this
kind of stuff the the reference design
for the 845 crushes everything in the
writing 2.0 test yeah but then the s9 +
gets beat by a Snapdragon 835 s8 and
yeah ok but then a pixel 2 XL is like
way below both of the Exynos wins and
data manipulation so randomly and loses
in everything else I think yeah I don't
even know what to tell you guys but
basically they've determined that the
Exynos 98n variant of the s9 is
significantly slower than the snap
dragon 8:45 the Snapdragon one is
available in Canada US China Japan and
Latin America and everyone else
including Europe gets the Exynos 9810 so
they've identified the root cause as a
very conservative scheduler and devfs
mechanisms so you know I was actually
kind of I was kind of bummed out that I
ended up with a Snapdragon version and
the intro is playing somewhere oh really
yeah oh I started playing it for like a
second by accident oh yeah yeah for just
like a second and then I skipped away
from it okay okay I was kind of bummed
because initially it looked like Exynos
was gonna perform better but then now
the Snapdragon performs better and
actually oh do you I am NOT beggin oh
yeah but I had X no slash generation I
think last generation that was better or
something you know what I'm at the point
now where phones haven't been slow
enough that it's mattered for like
probably about three years so yeah with
that said my iPhone 6 is really friggin
slow now like really slow I'm gonna
tempted to go in and see how to change
my battery okay
no the iPhone 6 isn't that old iPhone 6
release date here we go tubes 2014 bro
well three and a half years ago bro yeah
okay the 6s really was a lot faster too
but yeah and like once you hit three
years for a phone line two years you
start to really feel it it's really slow
though yeah like super bad at a
year-and-a-half I usually start at a
year to a year and a half I start really
noticing battery problems right and then
at two years I'm like there's battery
problems it's also kind of slow things
are getting at three years it's like
okay I want a new phone bugs are not
getting fast yeah yeah yeah all right
Apple releases iOS 11.3 yes here's from
apple.com naturally because nobody else
would consider this newsworthy no I I
wanted this I the only thing I have to
say about most of this
is that it's pretty boring yes we're
getting new AR experience okay we got a
straw pool this we got a straw pull the
hell out of this and it doesn't count if
you were just like tooling around with
it for ten minutes okay I want to know
who here has persistently used no you
don't have to use it like all the time
yeah okay have you both okay have you
actually used AR but okay might the
reason why I keep on saying this is I'm
sure a ton of people because we have a
very interested tech interested audience
yeah I've opened the app that's not what
we're talking yeah that's not what we're
talking about we mean like some form of
extended use not persistence I'm not
saying every day but like you you
actually really like kind of got into it
how about this okay so the pool is have
you actually used a okay cool we've got
no we've got tried it once it's lame /
not ready yet sure used it for something
practical like and it has to have
actually worked like not a ruler
application yeah where you measured a
room and it wasn't right like if it was
if it was right and that that was
actually useful for you that counts and
then we've got use it consistently cuz I
want to know is anybody actually using
AR I have laughed at one video of AR are
we counting Pokemon go no no we are
counting things that are being
advertised as a are because Pokemon go
was more like pointing your camera stuff
and then Pokemon kind of get inserted
into the scene it is technically
augmented reality but it there's nothing
spatial about it and it's very
old-school yeah it's it's not an
augmented reality device that uses any
kind of newer technology to actually
embed the graphics into the real world
it's just mostly putting them over top
of your camera
okay what about snapchat snapchat no
that's not it fixes onto your face
it does use tracking it's slightly newer
than go in terms of the tech I know what
you're talking about I know this still
isn't yeah that's really not it okay how
do we define this that's that's the
thing it's hard okay no guys I know it
is AR I know it's technically AR but I
think he's talking an application that
is specifically a are focused snapchat
is more about sharing pictures that has
an AR element know what that's a great
way to define it so I'm talking about
IKEA is furniture arranger okay
and I don't just mean you used it and
you put in the furniture and you like
thought oh this app is pretty cool I
mean you actually used it like you went
and bought something based on the
experience you had with it yeah or like
a game that overlays itself on to a
tabletop I'm talking an AR where AR is
central to the experience we and we know
Pokemon go use AR kit it's just very
basic we want something a little bit
more hardcore okay so no Pokemon go and
something that is absolutely our focus
okay someone in the chat ban all ir s--
that's good let's not get that confusing
that's like
hurry up so I can click no look we're on
it okay
all right while you guys reply to that
why don't we do our sponsors for the day
sponsor number one I am eating Oh No
let's maple buffalo bacon they sent so
many packs of this with the latest
don't touch my maple buffalo bacon you
can have anything else you want
oh yeah I did that we did a couple weeks
of like super spice I think I think we
both earned uh I think a little bit of a
relaxing departure from that I really
miss like every time I deserve nothing
so I had the huge piece and like that
were like that was painful
yeah so savage jerky is made with the
best ingredients without nitrates or
preservatives the goal was to create a
snack that's full of flavor and spice
but not bad for you
they've got 13 different flavors of
jerky with my personal favorite
a buffalo bacon I mean cut you off for
one quick second that is one thing to
know have you ever felt gross after
eating like a big thing of jerky yeah
like greasy yeah
have you ever felt that with these nope
no they're good they're not estimate
that's not in a thing yeah I haven't
been told to say that butter not grease
they're not greasy they don't feel this
one's greasy er than most this one is
but that one's not at all yeah so great
flavours mohos great traditional is
great the the salt and pepper one is
great the maple buffalo bacon cannot
endorse that strongly enough although I
will say it's not for everyone
someone tried it after the show and
they're like yeah but they've got lots
of different flavors for lots of
different tastes and they also make a
barbecue sauce a hot sauce a spice rub
their Carolina Carolina Reaper hot sauce
these is one of the hottest peppers in
the world and they've got Jerky's made
out of those same Reapers also ghost
peppers and if you're into it if you're
into punishment savage jerk you can do
it I don't care how tough you are how
spicy the food you eat is savage jerky
can be singular person on the planet
that I know of that is the best spice
tolerance that I personally know of who
like doesn't have a sense of smell so he
doesn't even have to worry about that
part of it all that kind of stuff did
okay eating it wasn't super great the
next day because he like scoffed it down
because it tasted good so like it's yeah
if you want to really go for it you can
you can so you can use offer code ltte
to save 10% at Savage jerky dot-com next
up we've got synergy - synergy - allows
you to share a single mouse and keyboard
between multiple computers be they
Windows Mac or Linux based they've got a
brand new UI that makes the whole thing
straightforward and easy to set up
without having to know like the IP
addresses of the machines their new
networking back-end allows you to
basically have it automatically work
with complex networks that synergy would
never have worked with before their SSL
encryption has been moved from the pro
to the basic tier so all users can
benefit from encryption their new
background service runs on all platforms
and lets users control all of their
machines before they've even logged in
which is pretty sweet as well
they've removed the concept of server
and client computers so users can now
share their mouse and keyboard from any
computer without having to reconfigure
so check out synergy 2 at seamless comm
slash synergy slash when for bringing us
finally to the big controversial one
someone just asked two winners when his
savage jerky gonna be acquired by McAfee
I just thought that I thought that was
kind of is there someone equally evil in
the food world Monsanto that we could
what is that you have not gone down
conspiracy rabbit holes I see no okay I
don't let's just keep you know what hold
on a second I'm take no I'm taking off
I'm taking off the sponsor lower third
we'll get to P ia in a minute okay
they're like I'm not super up on it I
used to be really well informed they
have something to do with um apparently
Nestle is evil and literally everyone
okay
what Nestle Nestle um they have a few
things they're a giant company so
there's gonna be some stuff I know they
were pulling water out of BC at some
like under the table kind of rate okay
okay um that was like a huge thing up
here for a little while there bottled
water is like pardon my french
awful like it is awful it's like the
worst it tastes like pool water well
like that you know that that that cheap
one that comes in that that but crinkly
bottle the crinkly body but everyone
rebrands but that is Nestle why it's
awful it's the worst bottled water I
rather drink tap water in like you know
how like any late work Times said that
BC has the most corrupt government in of
all North America I did hear about that
yeah yeah so that was part of that whole
thing because it was like super under
the table and they were buying it for
like essentially nothing just huge
amounts of water they have child labor
issues in Ghana tried to buy all the
rain water rights in Bolivia yeah
they're uh stopped producing they're
like water wars which are starting to
just kind of starting to happen now
people have been talking about happening
for a long time they're on the front of
that for sure
Oh
okay yeah someone says they wouldn't
even douche with Nestle water okay
that's a little far I think huh someone
says la tap water is actually excellent
an excellent is spelled wrong it's
probably from the water
sorry no offense no offense we love all
of our Californian viewers you guys are
great your water not so great anyway
sorry are you saying um anyways Monsanto
has something to do with genetically
modified organics oh whatever
I don't remember to what degree okay but
there's like insane amounts of
conspiracy theories around them I don't
know if they're true they might be true
I have no clue I'm not informed I'm
sorry if I remember correctly at one
point in time they were like
aggressively pushing farms to use their
stuff and trying to make uh sort of like
wasn't seeds that weren't theirs and I
don't know but I don't know if that's
true so many unsub's on follows so many
for what oh they don't burn your water
yeah yeah yeah look look look look we
have the greatest water in the world we
actually do we live in a rainforest yeah
like sorry it's hard to compare yeah I'm
just I'm being an elitist and it's not
nice and it's not fair please don't
unsub and I'm follow because I'm sorry
that I hurt your feelings okay somebody
in chat is saying they sue farmers for
seeds that blow into their land so like
the wind kid at someone else's saying
Monsanto kills GMO seeds and Sue's farms
for using their CI I don't know there's
a lot of stuff I don't know what's going
on I just people don't like him I don't
know okay all right okay all right all
right all right so anyway anyway anyway
anyway PIAA
so reasons to use private Internet
access
IP cloaking hides you true IP address
and your geographic location it allows
you to browse on and
that browse allows your file keeping
your identity hidden which is especially
important for a political dissidents
journalists human rights activists etc
that's what's going on right now I'm
going to China oh yeah yeah you should
have it
III braum I think the last time I was
there I think I had like five or six
installed just so I could like check
which one had the best out connection
you can avoid data mining and targeted
advertising you can block unwanted
connections you can unblock websites
allowing you to bypass lots of
government censorship censorship and
firewalls allowing you unrestricted
access to more of the Internet and you
can save money so not only is P ia
extremely affordable they actually allow
you to hide well where you're from and
browse websites that have different
pricing depending on your location so
travel is a key one here if you browse
as though you are from Asia for example
little interracial hot flights are often
much cheaper than if you look at them
from North America little pro tip oh
yeah
I think something legally changed in
China with VPNs by the way guy no yeah
so so obviously you're not using one
wind you there no totally not I will
check my gmail by using TeamViewer to my
nope that doesn't work I'm not doing
that I'm not doing that
oh yeah that's right TeamViewer doesn't
work there I remember trying it last
time yeah well anyway you can connect up
to five devices at the same time they
have over 3000 bare-metal servers and 44
locations across 28 countries and you
can get go sign up there there you go
there's your link pretty simple boom -
tech tips with dashes you want to hear
something crazy
yes um I don't know what the numbers at
now but the last time I looked at it was
like a couple hours ago
we've already had like 700 people sign
up with our lane Wow yeah not that
surprised to be honest because I know I
think there was hazy there was a little
bit of a response wind tunnel bear oh
well not wind tunnel bear came out and
told everyone but when people figured
out that tunnel bear was being purchased
by McAfee there was there was a response
and I think people were looking for it
maybe a new home
than the door new homes oh my oh I don't
have a lower third for LTX but LTX gonna
be awesome it's July 14th but the
Richmond Olympic Oval I'm actually so
stoked he's gonna be there absolutely
I'm gonna be there
it's an LTT meet up and tech convention
focuses on letting people get their
hands on cool technology oh this is cool
I took it start at $35 Canadian so
that's like $27 u.s. it's not just an
enormous you can get here yeah you can
check it out at LTX Expo Con and travel
yeah this is cool
we have a booth list now this like just
went up today I hate what yesterday's
this we don't know how many caves it
will be yet oh I didn't know what it was
yeah no I know and why would it be that
long I don't know I don't know blacked
out thing right you have a little black
with the K on it also might not be there
because it depends on so Nvidia
announced a new quad row okay two days
ago
well don't people tell people too much
and they figured out and well no no it's
fine it's just like I don't know if
they're gonna send us enough oh so
depending on how many of them because
it's 32 gigs of ram on this thing so
depending on how many they send we could
go crazy town yeah and depending how
many they don't send we could actually
not end up taking it at all because one
of our old Quadros died at some point so
we don't have enough cuadros to run the
old machine okay so it depends on Nvidia
support whether we'll be able to have it
there or not yeah so yeah mainstage this
time we're putting a cage around the
case toss cuz that was super day yep are
you gonna take part in a key swap
competition key swap keyboard key swap
competition oh wow there's a real change
to how we're running it this year it's
gonna be a lot more like prize and like
yeah like event focus I heard what that
I I don't think I'll win honestly I
usually do keyboard key swaps when I'm
like watching a show and I do it really
slowly we're gonna head out for
shuffleboard
I'm definitely doing that to shuffle I
want to do like all these heatsink
install race we're gonna probably have
our multi-headed VR set up there
just some
a CPU delighting booth we're hoping to
find a retailer who will like actually
allow you to buy a CPU there that's yeah
test it yeah I suggested make sure that
we're he's super cool super cool uber
maybe gonna have a land there I don't
BYOC LAN so Intel has like a mobile yan
force yeah they are apparently
considering showing up that would be so
cool yeah so I've met those gonna be I'm
sure
well they might through the show but I'm
sure they don't know me as an attendee
but I've met those guys at PAX for 11
years
yeah and they're super cool yep I like
there so there's gonna be lots of stuff
there and we're bringing back some of
the just like stupid carnival games like
the bungee run in the hamster ball race
and pedestal jousting a bungee run was
super fun yeah BS mods is gonna have a
booth I don't remember what they're
gonna be doing with people but last year
they did a tubing Bend right yeah red
line sort of tutorial things so it's
good and final it's gonna be great it's
gonna be a lot of fun I'm really excited
based on how good it was last year plus
all the improvements that have been
talked about I think it's gonna be
really good
oh the PIAA link is dead ah like did the
site crack yeah I would be pretty
surprised
Oh had sent me a message something about
re-enacting something oh yes you want me
to do it now I can I can do it now if
you need uh oh man yeah I need to do a
photo for my for my visa application for
going to works dude yeah okay no no the
link the link works you guys did we do B
copy thorough and linked you want to
throw that in the chat sure okay yeah
throw the chat um okay in the meantime
when we jump into one of our other
topics here we haven't even touched like
the bottom part of the dock do not mean
used there not any news topics AMD
strikes back at the geforce partner
program the original item lock 21 on the
forum the original article here is from
digit times yeah did you time apparently
the /pages part was not included in the
link that was pasted oh so now it's
there and
do you have us did you get Kirby yeah
oh nice do you have a switch well
technically I'm not gonna be able to
play for a while so like if you want to
borrow oh no the only switch I have is
the like work switch so I was just
worried you could borrow that I meant
the game oh okay oh oh oh oh they want
me they want me to go do a thing can you
handle can you handle a Geforce you know
nothing about it but sure yeah you know
what now hold on hold on let me let me
let me find so let me find something
well how much more do we need to do oh
oh dang uber settled with the family of
the woman that was killed by the
self-driving car what did you think they
were gonna do I don't know I thought it
was gonna get dragged out so to speak oh
oh you know what that's my cue to exit
um is that the end of the show no no I
just got to go do some stuff if you want
to go ahead and cover a topic or two on
your own I'll be right back all right
sounds good
okay
which would show oh man okay let's talk
about that why not let's do it could I
bring this up on screen I need to go on
here hold on guys
operating both laptops is no fun do you
do there we go
all right so we're talking about the the
I sounded horrible the did metal
grinding yeah try to only do it once
more
sorry okay that wasn't actually that bad
all right
uber reached a settlement with the
daughter and husband of Elaine Herzberg
who died after being hit by a self
driving uber vehicle in Tempe Arizona
the settlement presumably includes a
cash payment but no details were
provided by either uber or the family's
attorney also since last week people in
temp have uploaded videos of which we
can watch but doing this on his things
not great so okay I think what they're
doing is they're showing you guys can't
see it it doesn't work
way to go Linus also he sounds like he's
dying don't worry about that he's
completely fine I know that he's fine I
know what's happening over there I can't
show you guys but basically in ubers
footage it was super super dark and it
was really hard to see anything and
people are showing that driving on that
Street at that time of day it's actually
not that dark which goes pretty counter
to them saying like oh well the
self-driving thing couldn't see very
well and it's actually pretty well
illuminated and in some of the pictures
it shows quite a bit of lights going
along the side of the road yeah which
are not very visible in boobers footage
it also gives credence to the belief
that an alert driver could have
intervened because they would have been
able to see much more easily and it
makes sense because head light
illuminates farther than two seconds
ahead of a vehicle so it should have
been able to stop the uber topic deal
with the yeah you showed up like right
at the end of the uber topic so we're
good to move on to next one also that
door opening and closing during LAN show
should never be a thing oh really
yeah it's terrible oh wow all the metal
grinding noises Oh going into the mic
sorry everyone
we apologize we're really sorry
hopefully this makes it worse this helps
your ears to a little bit okay amy
strikes back yeah we can talk about it
it's kind of boring though AMD you
strikes back taiwan's asus tech gigabyte
and msi are caught in a dilemma over the
development and shipment of new gaming
models as they are DPP members but also
have long term partnerships with AMD
industry sources say it said that the
three Taiwanese brands have reportedly
adjusted their new product development
roadmaps and they may also launch new
gaming brands based on AMD's GPUs I mean
I don't see that being very effective
like can you Matt can you imagine like
what's a Seuss's brand gonna be like
your public of rayner's
you know gigabyte a or you Oh a or me
I'm sure their branding departments can
come up with something pretty good but
MSI's branding is literally gaming yeah
like that's what they call it it's just
like GG txt this game MSI AMD gaming III
doubt it I sincerely doubt it
this this whole thing just smells so bad
and you know what's really interesting
you can always tell when nvidia is in
like full-on damage control mode because
they say they don't damage control they
just don't do anything yep
and you know what it's not a bad
strategy because it's gonna work people
go away faster we're gonna get bored of
talking about it good we are you guys
are gonna get bored of hearing about it
because there's no proper news there's
there's no news the other side is upset
yeah if they said anything then that
would be newsworthy and we'd have to
talk about it again and it would
actually create a whole new new cycle of
of people being mad at Nvidia but as it
is Nvidia can just kind of sit there
quietly wait for this to go away and I
think they're gonna get away with it if
everything that's been said about this
whole program is actually true you know
then that will be a problem SpaceX is
apparently close to becoming an Internet
service provider so the original article
here's from the verge this was posted by
monkey business over on the forum this
is apparently not new news it's okay I
know - it's fine we're just gonna keep
talking about it anyways it's still
interesting and it's coming closer and
there's been new information that's come
out but like so it's satellite internet
which it's not gonna be the fastest
thing ever but right now is
extraordinarily expensive and I guess
there's a lot of room for improvement in
that particular industry and if your
whole deal is that you launch things
into space then getting into the
satellite communications business is
probably not that much of a stretch so
earlier this year they launched the
first two of their planned 12,000
satellite constellation the company is
starting out with a 4425 satellite array
and the FCC is requiring SpaceX to
launch at least half of them within the
next six years
so SpaceX hopes that StarLink will
become a big
a new generator that can help offset the
R&amp;amp;D and operations costs for the rocket
company SpaceX expects more than 40
million subscribers for StarLink by 2025
which would be roughly thirty billion
dollars in revenue so Apple for washer
oh right we got to go back to the straw
poll results oh we never did oh good
call twitch chat have you actually used
a are sixty-two percent of you say no
straight up no not even tried at once
straight up no twenty-eight percent of
you say tried it once it's either lame
or not ready yet
so essentially 90 percent of people so
literally 2 percent of an audience that
is hardly no offense hardly
representative out of general mainstream
population on normies use it
consistently here's what what okay like
I get that early on in any technology
it's kind of like land grab and it's a
land grab for like mindshare here here
here's the most confusing one why is
Apple involved in this yeah that's
usually their deal is to wait until all
the really like crappy stuff but they've
been acting weird for a long time ever
since Steve Jobs has been gone they've
been acting really weird hmm okay well
yeah so I like the thing is some we
could say like oh but Steve Jobs pushed
new things to insert in specific realms
and yeah you're right but his first
version would also be awesome I mean yes
and no I mean the iPhone didn't have
copy paste no but it was pretty sick
okay yes yes it was it was pretty nigh
the original iPad was kind of big and
brick like thick and battery life was
terrible but it was pretty sick for its
time okay all right all right all right
all right all right
so they are though like actually just
not very sick for its time apparently
most of you are pretty much on the same
page yeah that's what I mean like
there's a difference in the feel and
it's not even just the percentages that
tell the story here the user consistent
category is 35 people like like yeah and
you look at the millions of dollars
being invested into this for I'm sorry
how many actual like bodies that are
using it I don't know man and I think in
like in like 10 years and I'm not saying
that's like the beginning of it being
awesome I'm just saying in 10 years in
general yeah I'm not saying it's gonna
take that long and this isn't a
prediction of anything just in 10 years
I suspect it will be pretty commonplace
okay this is terrible
so this is supposed to buy xrq n on the
forum the original article here is from
xda-developers
LG is apparently seeking feedback on
display notches okay
LG here's some feedback no no we are so
close like we are actually not that far
away from being able to put these
elements under the display anyway you
know have the courage to not to not
isn't it weird that we've gone from like
Apple products are really nice but over
expensive and they can't game so the PC
people are like why why are you wasting
your money on that they can't play games
anyways - everyone's trying to copy
Apple even when it's not working like
Apple used to copy everyone else and
generally like do it with really nice
build quality yeah now it's everyone
copies Apple even though people don't
like it I don't know apparently some
people actually like the nagy why I
don't know maybe they never watch movies
or they don't want anything in their
notification bar I'm like I just don't
get it I can't even tell when my VPN is
connected or not cuz there's not enough
room yeah
whereas on the iPhone 8 I can tell and
like my notification bar is maxed
basically all the time yeah and I
actually look at it exactly because like
if there's certain icons
that are probably important things that
I need to check and other icons that art
has important know oh this is our last
big topic of the day this is supposed to
by sipping on the forum the original
article here is from NPR really oh boy
restricted by YouTube
gun enthusiasts are taking their videos
to pornhub Wow Wow so that's pretty
interesting cuz guns are sort of a huge
huge vertical on YouTube so starting
next month YouTube is going to be
banning certain subjects in the firearms
category prompting some channels to
upload their videos to the Canadian porn
site pornhub instead banned subjects
include selling firearms just be really
gentle when you close that the noise is
like aids on the mic yeah that's good
good just leave it perfect yeah
selling firearms or certain firearms
accessories through direct sales or
linking to sites that sell these items
now that second part huge like
deal-breaker yeah they won't be able to
take sponsorships from gun sights or and
if you take their address I'm taking
away their sponsorship completely away
what's left and if you know the thing
the thing is that they're one of the one
of the reasons that this is happening is
that this type of content is not
particularly add advertiser friendly in
the first place so it's not like these
guys have other advertisers banging down
their doors and while they will maybe
find advertisers whether they're
advertisers that are edgy and you know
more mainstream publications won't touch
them or whether they're just they just
don't really care what it will affect
too is the rates that they'll have to
pay because if there's less competition
for sponsorships or advertisements on
these particular channels then the rapes
inherently drop any instructions on
manufacturing a firearm ammunition
high-capacity meg homemade silencer
suppressor okay well
that probably shouldn't be a thing or
certain firewood if it's legal that's
the issue right to my knowledge
suppressors are not either in case you
can get suppressor in some places why
why not that's the question I'm not
necessarily or not it can be no there's
no reason for civilian to need a
suppressor there is actually a man
there's medical reasons easier on your
ears I'm not arguing for either side I'm
just saying there is arguments for why
you might want one okay do you know how
much that entire band of earplugs cost
thanks four dollars possibly not enough
depending on what there is and what
you're firing you'd probably need over
ear protection and we're both in some
new stuff so you know how much that over
your protection up there cost I'm not
arguing I'm stating but it's they're
also banning okay so the accessories
include those that enable a firearm to
simulate automatic fire or convert a
firearm to automatic fire and
high-capacity Meigs instructions for how
to convert a firearm to automatic or
okay those are duplicated you know um so
in range TV which has 144,000
subscribers on YouTube has chosen to
publish videos on pornhub and a search
on the site yields 5 videos currently
uploaded by in range TV Wow
do you need something else oh okay
what okay um all right so that was
pretty much it for the land show today
thank you very much for watching we'll
see you again next week
same bat-time same bat-channel
goodbye hold on we're still rolling the
outro
and says brush off your dirty right
sleeve please okay there you go
just in time for the show to be
completely over baby boo boo boo my
favorite president even see it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
