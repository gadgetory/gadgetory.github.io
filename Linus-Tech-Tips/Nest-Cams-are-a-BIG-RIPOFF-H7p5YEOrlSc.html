admittedly short-sighted decision to
purchase three drop cat excuse me
nest cams without reading the fine print
sure they had excellent image quality a
modern design and a super easy to use
app but there was one fatal flaw in
addition to the $150 per camera upfront
cost nest wants a whopping five to
thirty dollars per camera per month to
store the footage in the cloud for you
and they offer no way for you to hook up
your own storage device so we put
together this it costs a third as much
and has no monthly fees speaking of
things with no monthly fees that is to
say as long as you pay for it yearly
private Internet access
it's a VPN service that encrypts all of
your Internet traffic and uses a safe
protected IP it's got a ton of other
useful features too so check it out at
the link below
there are a ton of reasons why someone
might want a security camera system even
if you're not a drug dealer or whatever
a handful of cameras on your property
can act as a deterrent for would-be
burglars remember they're often after
the easy score not the big one they can
be a convenient way to monitor your pets
or kids when they're at home alone they
can significantly aid law enforcement
efforts to recover stolen goods and this
one's kind of a no-brainer they can even
lower your insurance rates making it so
they effectively pay for themselves so
what do we got well the bill 3ch is
actually pretty simple all we need is a
rasp i 0w so that's wireless so you
don't need a dongle or anything like
that
a little camera module it connects with
a ribbon cable and there's even a
prebuilt operating system some guy made
called motion iOS is it free yeah sick
and open-source all right let's do it
since these cameras are intended for use
indoors we forwent any waterproofing but
this could be done fairly easily with
some silicone and conformal coating so
after two days of tinkering with the
software measuring the electronics and
modifying some existing models from
Thingiverse we had a couple of options
for 3d printed enclosures for our
cameras so the model I found online
actually needed a little modification
for the heatsink wait how's Barry PI
runs that hot yeah especially when you
overclock which we're gonna do it's a
it's a preset that's built in but you
can get much better frame rate when you
overclock them and I made a little arm
that adjusts both ways so you can lots
of tilting pan that's cool I see we've
taken the Chinese action cam approach
and ripped off GoPro hey man they make
good stuff ok other way
there you go for those of you hoping to
build something similar at home you can
pick up a case with holes already cut
for the official razz pie camera modules
from mod mypie or you could get the
models linked in the description printed
from a company like Shapeways okay so I
pre-configured the OS and the Wi-Fi is
that can be a little time-consuming the
first time but we should just need to
plug it in and wait for it to boot up
hopefully it actually works right and
powered yeah I know but it might not
have detected it so now that we're
booted up you can see our IP we've got a
login screen we should really do a
written guide on this yeah we just on
the form probably should you could do
that up for me that would be great
thanks okay let's see the interface so
this is really cool the number of
customization options in the software
can look a little overwhelming at first
but the premise is pretty simple now we
just have this camera module here
attached to this R as PI at the moment
so all we need to do is add the camera
in set up our desired config so we're
going to use 720p 10 fps and then just
set the footage to store on one of our
servers here at the office what actually
gets recorded is pretty much up to you
so we're setting ours up to just
continuously record up to a maximum of
twenty four hour long clips with a
preservation length of one month after
which the old footage will be
automatically deleted but you can also
set it to record only when motion is
detected which will help you preserve
space and your sanity if you ever have
to go back into the footage to look for
something so our config will change a
little bit once we have multiple cameras
but we can talk more about that later so
this is pretty cool already but we can
take it to another level a more
conventional security camera enclosure
would keep our R as PI's zeros much
safer outside and would look a lot more
like a professionally installed security
system so we actually borrowed the idea
of a common home security
back buying fake CCTV cameras off Amazon
to kind of like set up around your
property except we are going to put real
cameras inside you know I'd say you're a
genius
but it was my idea once our fake cameras
arrived cracking them open revealed an
almost entirely empty casing perfect we
didn't end up 3d printing a little
holding bracket for our camera but if I
were you I wouldn't bother it's much
easier to just remove the black plastic
piece that holds the fake camera and hot
glue the real one into place as for the
power cable the rear housing just needed
a little hole for it so now that we have
two cameras with the potential for more
it's actually recommended that you get
another R as pie and run motion iOS on
it as a server mmm no camera attached so
we've got an example of what that might
look like right here so most of its
processing power can be devoted to
encoding footage to be stored onto your
Nass via the network cable that way you
can see all of your Wi-Fi cameras in one
place do note though that you will need
something like a raspy three plus
because a PI zero won't be able to
handle the load of a bunch of cameras so
that'll limit the resolution and the
frame rate of the footage that can be
recorded to make this config work better
the cameras themselves can be run in a
special setup called fast network camera
mode which uses the PI zeros GPU to
encode a motion JPEG stream to the PI
server for much higher image quality and
frame rate so you can check out the
forum post in the description for a
how-to on that these actually looks
surprisingly good like that wide-angle
looks sick yes so both of them are
running 720p 10 FPS right now which
doesn't sound like a lot but you know
for a security camera it's actually
quite a bit yeah I mean these look way
better than your average CCTV and all of
the footage that you get can either be
backed up to Google Drive
so goodbye expensive nest subscription
or it can be stored directly on a local
as or just a PC where it'll be safe from
third parties and other prying eyes and
because you can choose your own camera
elements you can decide what features
you want on each one so this one has a
fairly narrow field of view whereas the
one that we have over there is using a
wide-angle lens so I guess it's
conclusion time then this DIY solution
is a super awesome way to keep you in
control of your cameras and it can
actually help save you a very
significant amount of money every month
for your home or business but there are
some compromises first we're giving up
any special features like audio whether
it's two-way or one-way second the
control panel does look pretty great as
a mobile webpage but you'll need to do
port forwarding tomfoolery in order to
access it remotely and there is
currently no Android or iOS app and then
finally the casings and mounts frankly
don't really look that great oh and keep
in mind that you won't have any support
number to call if you're having issues
as helpful as those typically may or may
not be the cove commuter is a portable
bluetooth speaker that you can take
anywhere that's where the portable part
comes in it connects via bluetooth
that's where the Bluetooth part comes in
and features 10 meter range that's
almost 33 feet it features an X bass
subwoofer to let you feel the bass and
it doubles as a speakerphone for
incoming calls the rechargeable battery
can last up to 8 hours and is
water-resistant with an IP x4 rating
it's got two EQ modes one designed for
indoors and one designed for outside and
you can check it out today at the link
below so thanks for watching guys if you

at the link in the video description
also down there is our merch store which
has cool shirts like this one
sans whole and our community forum which
you should totally join which is by the
way where you're gonna find the guide
for how to make yourself one of these on
