of fractal design products over the last
little while this is going to be the
last one this is the fractal design
silent series fan and it comes in lots
of different sizes but we're looking at
the 120 millimeter one since that's
bound to be the most popular it is rated
at 1000 rpm
15 decibels and actually there's a bunch
of other specs on the back so it's a 120
by 120 by 25 millimeter that means it's
not an overly thick fan it rotates at a
thousand rpm and the noise is 15
decibels airflow is 38.3 set okay why
don't you actually just read it can you
read that No zoom in more can you read
it now excellent okay so there and the
rubber fan mounts absorb vibrations so
let's get this opened up and have a look
in this particular unboxing assuming I
can figure it out quickly enough on
camera I'm actually going to plug it in
and see just how loud this silent series
fan is so first of all let's have a look
at the accessories it includes force
filler for screws and they're black
so they'll match your black case if you
have a black case okay and then for
rubber isolating noise isolating fandoms
actually these are kind of a unique
design they're a little bit different
from ones I've seen in the past so you
see that they actually have like a gap
in the middle so that does something I'm
assuming okay
so then the fan it's black and white
which is the theme with a lot of their
fans and cases and in power supplies
it has a sleeved connector which is
always nice to see I hate those red
yellow and black connectors it's just it
looks really messy I mean here look at
this this is a computer that I've worked
on and haven't bothered to sleeve the
cables I mean that's just austell not
very nice at all so why don't we plug
this in and I'm just going to kind of
creep around the side here step over all
the mess I'm actually moving soon so
it's everything's kind of all over the
place at the moment some of its unplug
the radiator fan oops
and then plug in the out fan
let's plug in this one so do you want to
come a little bit closer camera person
see if we can that's actually pretty
quiet you're not gonna you want to get
the camera close so that you can
actually hear it with the camera in
theory even like way closer than that
there you go so basically you can't hear
it because the fans in this computer are
actually quite a bit louder than this
one yep so it's very silent I'm not sure
it moves a whole lot of air but there
you go that's the unboxing and first
look at the fractal design silent 120
millimeter fan</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
