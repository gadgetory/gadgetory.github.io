razorblade there 2018 model addressed
almost every previous problem except the
price at 2400 US dollars it is darn
expensive but what if you could save a
buck by cutting but some razor humor
there some of the bells and whistles
well razor had the same idea this is the
base version of the razor blade a
slightly lower powered slightly thicker
model with a significant price cut but
has this made the blade more accessible
or just worse well you guys are smart
kids who read the title before you click
a video so I guess you already know the
answer just like you already knew this
terrible Segway was coming into our
sponser Thermaltake thermal takes a 500
has a modern minimalist design with its
brushed aluminum and dual hinge swing
tempered glass panels check it out today
at the link below
compared to the advanced version of the
blade the most obvious change is the
thickness but in return we ditch the
proprietary power connector and we get
Gigabit Ethernet and that's on top of
the blades already very solid i/o and
I'm happy to say that the base version
has actually kept Thunderbolt 3 support
but the extra thickness does take away
some of the sex appeal and while the
overall look and feel is still pretty
good the bottom feels a lot more
plasticky and cheap cpu performance also
stays solid though thanks to a six core
Core i7 processor and the addition of 2
terabytes of spinning storage on top of
the 240 gig boot SSD means that you'll
be able to bring a massive game library
with you on the go and there's even more
good news for years razor blades were
known for sounding like an f1 car mating
with a leaf blower and although the
basic blade does get a bit louder than
the advanced model it is much better
than the older rounded versions so far
so good
until now the real sacrifice that was
made for the base blade was in the
graphics department the reduction to a
gtx 1060 max-q
leaves some gaming performance to be
desired
now it's quite a competent 1080p gaming
experience and in a vacuum this machine
would be getting a stellar review but
the issue is that other computer makers
exists a Seuss's zephyrus leaves the
basic blade in the dust with its gtx
1070 max-q and this thing isn't even an
outlier making matters worse the extra
FPS wouldn't even help us much because
the basic is only available with a 1080p
60 Hertz display which is a real bummer
if they at least offered maybe for like
$100 more or something a 120 Hertz or a
144 Hertz screen option they could make
a real play for eSports gamers with this
machine titles like overwatch and League
of Legends with
easily run at that framerate on a 10 60
max queue so once again the Zephyrus
whoops the bass blades but with a 144
Hertz display on top of its better specs
and then adding insult to injury the
webcam on those efforts also pounds the
blade basic another thing that got a
considerable downgrade from the advance
queue so that means that the blade basic
is now a tough sell for performance
enthusiasts eSports players and for Game
streamers that's rough but the thing is
that while the Zephyrus does punt the
baseplate out of the park when it comes
to gaming like have you ever looked at
this thing it has its own issues if you
try to use it as a lap top like on your
lap it just doesn't work between the
flappy doodle thing at the bottom and
the keyboard being so close to you there
is absolutely no way to get comfortable
and while the miniscule trackpad crammed
over on the right here is more usable
than you might expect
the blades is one of the best on the
market it's large accurate and really my
go-to example for how track pads should
be done on a Windows machine too bad I
can't say the same about the keyboard so
while the basic blade wins for gaming on
the go I'm really disappointed that they
didn't manage to keep the same key
switches as the advanced model trading
them for a considerably mushy or
alternative they're bad enough that if
you can find a desk it's safe to say
that typing and gaming would be more
enjoyable on the Zephyrus at least until
the battery dies so one of the greatest
strengths of the new 2018 blade is its
massive battery but hold on a moment
remember how the base blade got a 2
terabyte hard drive why isn't this
available on the much more expensive
advanced blade well you don't save
enough space for something like that
magically and when we did open up the
base blade we were greeted with well the
man behind the curtain so to speak there
it is so we have swapped out the 80
our battery in the advanced for a 65
watt hour in order to make room for this
hard drive on a more positive note at
least the upgrade ability is solid in
here with both our MDOT to drive and our
ddr4 sodium's
easily accessible along with their Wi-Fi
card if you're into that sort of thing
so we've talked a lot about the zephyrus
in this video almost as much as the base
blade and that's because in many ways it
is the clearly better laptop if you're
looking to do a fair bit of gaming the
better display and graphics card make
those efforts the easy choice but what
about the folks who only occasionally
game well for you guys honestly I don't
think I can really recommend the basic
blade either not in a world where the
Dell XPS 15 exists for the same price it
does cost you a substantial graphics
downgrade to a dt x 1050 TI but the much
better screen keyboard general build
quality and massive 97 watt hour battery
make it superior in pretty much every
other scenario with the advanced version
of the razor blade 2018 we loved razors
no compromises approach it's a great
gaming machine but it's also a usable
day-to-day then with the basic what we
realized was that once razor started
making compromises while still
commanding a relatively high price tag
they open themselves up to competition
from all sides making this machine still
good like just to be very clear it's
still good it's just harder to recommend
