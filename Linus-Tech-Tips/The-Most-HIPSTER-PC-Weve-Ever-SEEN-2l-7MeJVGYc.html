desktop was in your own room where it
could be as big and bright and loud as
you wanted without anybody yelling at
you
unfortunately for many of us life is
just not that simple anymore
maybe you're in a dorm room or in a
studio apartment with no walls or maybe
your wife just never lets up with that
computer is so ugly can't you just use a
laptop it doesn't go with our reimagined
boho aesthetic that's what she sounds
like
anyway whatever the reason there are
times when it's beneficial for your
gaming rig to be inconspicuous or have
an air of sophistication and if you like
the cut of my jib then I'd like to
introduce you to the volta V on the
outside it's a mature piece for your
space but on the inside it's a frame
rate destroying Beast
synergy allows you to share your mouse
and keyboard between multiple computers
at once check it out now at the link in
the video description the Volta V is a
15.6 leader complete system from
computer direct outlet whose
custom-designed enclosure is made of
domestically sourced selectively cut you
ése walnut or if you're more into
chowman than apple pie bamboo in many
ways it's a wonderful marriage of form
and function the uninterrupted facade
makes it look completely at home on your
desk or entertainment center while the
front i/o on the side is still easy to
access the rest of the i/o is at the
back well actually in an effort to
streamline cable management most of the
iOS actually inside the box and we
access it simply by lifting off the
magnetically held lid no tools required
not all of it though is that easy to get
at due to the 92 millimeter rear cooling
fan with that said inside we've got an
entire motherboards worth of connections
our asrock z2 7e MITx AC is equipped
with dual Gigabit LAN ports six USB
three five gig ports no type-c though
onboard AC Wi-Fi and three video outputs
but you won't need those because there's
an HDMI port and three DisplayPort ports
on the back of the what GT X 1080 TI
very nice so what else is in here while
there are a ton of options on CD o site
our unit has a core i7 7700 K KB Lake
chilled by a 92 millimeter ASA Tech
all-in-one liquid cooler with 16 gigs of
DDR four RAM and a 512 gig samsung 960
pro m2 SSD power is taken care of by 600
watt SFX power supply from Corsair with
custom length cables to keep everything
nice and tidy inside which is a nice
touch because even with a few
questionable decisions like the friction
mount for the radiator it looks
feels as classy and premium inside as it
does out it's little things like the
shielded PCIe riser and quiet and
efficient Noctua fans which brings us to
thermals air is drawn in through these
easy to clean nylon dust filters then
it's exhausted out the back end in three
discrete cooling zones for the power
supply GPU and everything else and even
with all of those high-performance parts
inside there was no smoke and no thermal
throttling though I will admit that
after running synthetic benchmarks for a
while the room did smell a little woody
it even stayed impressively quiet though
at idle it's barely louder than the
noise floor in our office and while it
does of course get louder under load it
never screamed like some small
form-factor systems do bottom line then
the volta ve can make short work of your
favorite games without causing a CodeRed
even if it's sitting on your desk just a
few centimeters away and that's a fine
spot to put it since it's designed to
support your monitor on top of hide your
keyboard underneath that is unless you
have a mechanical keyboard which brings
us to the volt of ease shortcomings the
biggest one being the feet our unit is
missing one and the ones that we do have
simply roll off whenever you slide them
across the very desk they're meant to
protect so I give them an F+ furthermore
some of the unsanded surfaces and the
roughly cut emi shielding leave the
volta v feeling less finished than you'd
expect a fine piece of furniture to be
the lack of anything resembling a
deliberate alignment on this end of the
case makes my OCD flare up something
fierce and finally there are some
problems with what designers call
affordance this recess for example seems
to imply that I should lift from this
side but actually I'm required to lift
from here where there is no recess and
to me the protruding front piece looks
like a drawer that I should pull on but
it doesn't open these might sound like
nitpicky things but considering the cost
of this case I
to mention them our configure came to
three thousand four hundred and nine
dollars which means that after custom
power supply cables air filters and a
PCI Express extender we are still well
over a thousand dollars for the lifetime
service warranty and the chassis so is
that worth your money
well depending on what kind of furniture
stores you shop in it'll either look
like a ripoff or a bargain so I will
leave that up to you and focus on the
stuff that we can quantify the volta v
gets the thermals and noise right and is
easily serviceable and upgradable all
while looking subjectively gorgeous the
only trick then is getting some
furniture budget allocated to it without
also giving up some of the boy toy
budget synergy is a software download
that solves once and for all the problem
of having multiple computers and
multiple keyboards and mouse connected
to them so you have to like physically
move if you want to go between them
together remember which one goes to
which it's a nightmare it allows you to
share one Mouse and one keyboard between
two or more computers over the network
so you'll no longer confuse which one
goes to which and the best part is it
works cross-platform so you can have
your Windows Station for gaming and your
Mac station for productivity and your
Linux station and you can just drag the
mouse across the screens seamlessly
they've got features like clipboard
sharing between the computers drag and
dropping files between computers the
ability to set up hotkeys and more so
check out their basic and pro options
and save 50% on synergy at the link in
