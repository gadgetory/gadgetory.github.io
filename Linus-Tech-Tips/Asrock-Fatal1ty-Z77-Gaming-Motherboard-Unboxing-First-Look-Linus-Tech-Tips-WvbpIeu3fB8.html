have requested this is the ass Rock
fatality professional series z77
motherboard so this is an LGA 1155 board
using the z77 chipset which means you've
got support for all the latest features
including third generation Intel Core
processors nvidia sli ati/amd crossfire
X technology Windows 7 which is sort of
not really the latest as well as a bunch
of other stuff so they've got five five
five which I guess is better than
gigabytes three three three maybe that's
what they were going for here so five
times land speed five x USB speed and
five times system speed with X fast Ram
X fast USB next fast land ok so you can
Photoshop apparently up to five times
faster X fast Ram will create oh that's
cool
no no this might actually be cool okay
so X fast Ram will create a virtual disc
from the system memory to boost the
performance for Photoshop it can even
perform five times faster than before
neat lower latency in games with as
rocks motherboard with X fast land
versus other motherboard without it and
USB comparison five times faster
although they don't really say why
powered by F net okay high performance
this is a feature of lucid virtu MVP
which is an updated version of virtue of
allowing switchable graphics so you can
get the best of your dedicated graphics
part card and your onboard graphics card
as well as virtual vsync which I don't
know I tried it felt like there's more
input legs so I didn't really like it
that much in high performance which adds
performance to some games using the
onboard VGA on your CPU smart connect
technology rapid start technology turn
on really fast as well as a bunch of
other cool stuff premium gold caps yes
they are gold-plated very cool digital
power design sixteen plus eight power
phase design I capable of four dims at
up to twenty eight hundred megahertz
plus and the fatality Mouse port is
pretty cool because what it allows you
to do is automatically customize the
polling rain and other features of the
mouse port to be the same as what
Jonathan fatality
you can play quake no but seriously I've
seen him play he's much much better than
me I don't mean to be ragging on the guy
it's just that I think you should for
things like Maus said that settings I
think you should find what works for you
that's all
I don't think that necessarily using the
same polling rate on your USB port is
going to dramatically improve your
gameplay however that doesn't take away
from the fact that this looks like an
absolutely beastly
motherboard with a very very complete
accessory package by the look of things
so let us continue moving on with the
fatality professional z77 so first you
got your quick installation guide which
ironically is about 8 meters thick
you've also got a utility DVD download
the latest from the Azeroth website six
SATA port SATA ports SATA cables an i/o
shield that is handily color-coordinated
and apparently there's a lot of
different help points on this
motherboard so we're gonna check that
out to molex to SATA adapters these are
super handy even if you don't use them
for this build you might run into a use
for them sometime in the future okay
that's just a hard hard SLI bridge we've
also got a front USB three three and a
half inch to internal header this is
super handy it's great that it comes
with it and you can even unscrew it from
the three and a half inch bay piece and
put it on to an i/o shield and use it
for the back of your case if you already
have front USB three so that's really
really neat a couple of more guides as
well as a software setup guide and now
let's have a look at the board itself so
it's got a very unique look it'll go
really well with your fatality 1000 watt
power supply where is that oh you know
what we actually did an episode on the
NCIX comm channel not that long ago
about color coordinating your build
where we had an asus crosshair 5 formula
and the fatality power supply we had
Radeon 7970 graphics cards red LED
lighting it looked absolutely amazing so
a board like this on the intel side
would go great with a build like that
so here we go we got our gold-plated
capacitors we've got our LG 11:55 CPU
socket remember this is compatible a 2nd
gen Sandy Bridge or 3rd gen Ivy Bridge
Intel Core processors these memory slots
as I mentioned before support up to ddr3
2800 megahertz
look at that an IDE port it when's the
last time you saw an IDE part I mean as
Rock has really gone all out to include
everything I mean maybe Jonathan has
like an IDE optical drive that he really
likes I do I have I have one of those
BenQ ones that was like the epitome of
optical drives in his IDE I haven't had
a board I can use it on in ages
so there you go maybe he has one too so
we've gone an 8 pin power connector in
the top of the board in its ideal
location 24 pin power connector along
the right-hand edge of the board and
it's similarly ideal location front USB
3.0 port 6 SATA 3 6 gigabit per second
ports with 4 SATA 3 say 2 to 3 gigabit
per second ports and for better
performance we suggest port 0 to 5 is
boot devices so that's these ones
remember for 0 to 5 is 1 to 6 in sort of
real people terms so these are the ones
running off the Intel controller these
guys are running off of what is
evidently an AZ media controller alright
onboard power buttons also fatality
themed power and reset onboard post
debugging LED we've also got front USB
to front firewire our front panel
connectors which aren't helpfully
labeled we've got really a floppy
connector can you install quick off a
floppy drive I'm not actually sure it's
pretty old game check this out though
we've got a PL expert John here so you
should be able to see some pretty
intelligent switching of the PCI Express
Lanes it's really tricky the more stuff
you build in to these z77 boards whether
it's third-party chipsets for SATA
whether it's more USB 3 whether it's
additional PCI Express slots the
trickier it gets for this the onboard
CPU PCI Express controller to manage it
so the plx chip I'm not sure what it's
working on over there but it's probably
just allowing it to get the best
performance possible these chips aren't
cheap so they
you go it's on the board in terms of pci
express slots we've got two PCIe 1x two
PCI and three PCIe 16x oval please note
this one's only wired for 4x and is only
really going to be fully functional and
basically I wouldn't put anything too
demanding in it like a graphics card
unless you're running an Ivy Bridge CPU
and even then it's not going to be ideal
for all intents and purposes this is a
2-way SLI onto a crossfire compatible
board that is two cards you can still
run in Quad SLI and crossfire with dual
GPU cards this one is only at 8x but
remember this is 8x pcie 3.0 so that
means you've got the same bandwidth as
pcie 2.0 16x so you're gonna get full
performance on a two cards going here
front audio is over here in its ideal
location and you got it let's have a
look at like the cooling solution that
we got going on here and get some
close-ups of that it looks pretty good
Jonathan signed it over here got some
more beefy aluminum heats things going
on over here he wants me to keep turning
it I think now you're talking about fans
Oh fans good thinking
apparently this means fans according to
stick which is like sort of abstract but
whatever so we've got 1 2 2 4 pin pwm
fan headers and then 1 2
three pin no.4 3 pin fan headers so
mostly done by 3 pin 2 PWM personally to
me it doesn't make much of a difference
I very rarely plug fans into my
motherboard anyway because I usually use
a real fan controller but there you go
now you know yeah that's right ok good
job thanks Lee on the back you find not
really much of note other than a
backplate and then oh and some via chip
cool now let's have a look at what we've
got in terms of i/o you have lots of
different i/o so we have 6 USB 3.0 port
speaking of adding extra things you know
like more USB 3 we've also got a ps2
keyboard mouse combo port these are huge
if you have a high-end keyboard that
only runs on ps2 and a lot of the
mechanical ones do you're gonna make
sure to get one of these ps2 ports HDMI
and DisplayPort out cover your digital
display out options remember if you want
to run the onboard graphics in addition
to your dedicated graphics card in order
to take advantage of quick sync which
allows you to quickly encode video or
transcode video you will want to run off
of one of these or over here you just
have to make sure the software is
connected correctly 6 USB 2.0 ports
eSATA firewire dual Gigabit LAN optical
audio out as well as 5.1 audio or 7.1
rather audio out via analog I think I
never mentioned the front USB 3 header
that's running off the Intel chipset and
this is like I said one of the more
complete boards I've seen in a very long
time I mean even to the point where it's
got like floppy and IDE connectors on it
very cool so you can connect a grand
total of like two drives here ten drives
here and like a floppy drive don't
