Pro this is an all-new platform from
Intel the z77 chipset supporting not
only second generation that is Sandy
Bridge core i3 Core i5 and core i7
processors but also third generation
processors so that is codenamed Ivy
Bridge so these are all z77 boards have
the following traits in common actually
I'm going to stick with what all a Suzy
77 boards have because not all of them
have things like the dual intelligent
processors that is for energy efficiency
or for performance as well as their
smart digi+ which is their eighth
generation of digital vrm so they are
all pcie 3.0 ready
they all have support for crossfire X
and then the certified boards have
support for nvidia sli okay ii 22 / 32
nanometer processor support so that is
second and third generation processors
virtue MVP this is really cool virtue
MVP actually has a number of neat
effects so one is it can actually boost
your performance - is it can reduce
tearing in scenarios where your frame
rate goes above the actual refresh rate
of the monitor and finally it no longer
requires you to plug the cable into a
specific outlet in order to switch
between D mode and AI mode so you can
make use of that quick sync technology
on the CPU which allows you to quickly
encode video without sacrificing gaming
performance okay moving on down we've
got Intel Smart Response technology
which allows you to use an SSD as a
cache to boost up the performance of
your boot drive as well as moving over
haha this is awesome USB BIOS flash back
easy BIOS flash back this is a killer
feature because basically it allows you
to no matter what you do to your
motherboard recover it quickly and
easily just by loading a BIOS file onto
a USB Drive throwing it in the back of
the board and pressing you know what I'm
just going to show you guys pressing the
let it go yeah I found it guys normally
it's here so I was expecting to tell you
guys the button that you press but
actually on this particular board it
down here doesn't make much of a
difference it's not something you'll be
using very often knock on wood
but it's there and it's super handy
because you don't even have to have a
CPU or memory installed in order to
recover your BIOS thumbs up because it
could save you an RMA which can be up to
a week of downtime without your system
moving on we have their network eye
control which the coolest feature in the
network eye control is actually the
ability to prioritize various
applications it's pretty easy to set up
in the AI suite so all you do is take
any network using applications you bump
them up into the sort of the manage
applications queue and then you just
click on the priority in order to set
them to high medium or low so that's
really neat as well a USB 3 boost so
true.you ASP support now this is kind of
tricky because the z77 chipset natively
supports Intel USB 3 ports so this guy
hold on one of these two front ones is
going to be an Intel USB 3 port set of
ports and then two of these rear ones
are going to be our ok pullin one header
for the front will be Intel 2 ports for
the back will be Intel one header for
the front is going to be as media and
then two ports for the back are going to
be as media so the Intel ports are going
to over time have the advantage probably
of you know more general wider
compatibility to do it being Intel and
they validated everything to death but
as media has the advantage of supporting
us piece with an compatible device you
can get dramatically better performance
under the as media ports so each Zeus
gives you the option use this and this
or use this and this whatever you decide
you will get the best possible balance
precise power control so as I mentioned
before this is their eighth generation
this is a fully digitally powered board
now what's cool about what asus has done
with
77 Birds they're actually moving away
from using different types of PWM
designs throughout their lineup so this
is a pro-level board this is a fairly
high tier board but even on their lower
end boards they are still going to be
using digital digital power for the CPU
the memory as well as the integrated GPU
so gone are the days when you have to
buy a deluxe level board or a sabertooth
or an ROG board to get digital power
control for your integrated GPU which
you are in all likelihood not using nope
asus has moved those features down with
the trickle-down effect to the boards
that really need it finally Wi-Fi goes
so this particular one comes with a
Wi-Fi module which can actually be used
not only to access your wireless network
but also to stream media to support a
DLNA devices as well as use your
motherboard as an AP so as an access
point for networking so DLNA media hub
got that covered Wi-Fi connectivity
everywhere yep so you can stream to your
iPad to your phone other DLNA devices
very cool you know what if you guys are
curious about GPU you should probably
check out my my roundup of pre-canned
overclocking utility so you can either
use the TPU button to get an automatic
overclock although I wouldn't recommend
that because the the aggressive mode in
their AI suite the most extreme mode
allows it to tune itself find the sweet
spot for your CPU and really max it out
in a way that these these one-button
utilities cannot do let me just see if
I've missed anything else on the back
here if an expert to is really cool
so you can set user definable sorry
about that you can set user definable
curves so that you basically tell it
what temperature's you want it to run at
what rpms also provides an RPM fixed
mode as well as you an automatic fan
speed detection mode which allows you to
basically just more intelligently figure
out what exactly you want to do as far
as balancing your fan speed and your
cooling goes here we go so we've got
support for HDMI 1.4 which means 3d very
cool SATA mode notice are configured to
a GI mode by default
thank you a Suzanne
about time more motherboard
manufacturers started moving to HCI mode
by default because so many users are
Lego online USSD doesn't perform very
good it's like while you're running an
IDE mode what can we do for you and once
you once you've installed the OS onto an
IDE mode drive it's a bit of a bear to
get it changed around to HCI mode here's
the Wi-Fi go card user guide including
various things such as access point mode
the Wi-Fi engine why if I go the
moveable omnidirectional antenna alright
we've got the user guide as well as the
drivers and utilities disk which you
should ignore and download the latest
about the excuse website you've got an
SLI cable we've got any Q connectors so
these are two more easily plug in your
front ports including front USB 2 as
well as your front panel connectors such
as your power and whatnot we have ok a
Wi-Fi module here which unfortunately I
was traveling recently and I forgot to
put my knife back on my keychain I don't
know how I'm gonna get this open guys
alright we're good
slick was gonna turn off the camera for
me mercifully but I didn't end up
needing it so there's the module
presumably there's an antenna that I
missed yep ok more accessories sorry
about that guys so then there's that
movable and this is cool because it has
magnets on the bottom of it so you can
actually position it wherever you want
it looks like he's moved the one that
was on my test bench before but I had it
just like bolted to the side of the
power supply actually here oh oh that's
too bad because okay there's the wires
here but yeah you can stick it to
anything metal IO sealed rear rear eSATA
as well as USB to just if you want some
extra ports back there to say two three
six gigabit per second cables to say two
to three gigabit per second cables these
are all straight to right angles and
finally the board itself so we've
covered most of the features so we're
gonna go pretty quickly on the overview
asus has actually got a really cool
heatsink design I'm always sort of you
know if you have always interested to
see what they have my favorite is still
the I think I called it fortress of
solitude design that they had on their
p55 boards I really liked that but this
one's pretty good too it's very new age
and digital like it kind of looks like
City sort of thing I think it looks kind
of neat and then this one is matching
down here so that's your your tips a
heat sink I mean mostly these heat sinks
are for decoration these CPUs on this
platform aren't gonna pull a ton of
power
I shouldn't say they're for decoration
we do still need to cool the vrm but
we're not talking you know an x79
platform where you got a six core CPU or
anything like that this will be a four
core CPU platform here is our digital
power delivery as well as our LGA 1155
socket so be careful when you're
installing it and don't try and install
an 11 56 CPU I remember when all of them
came with warnings about that and write
support out of the box for 2nd
generation and third generation CPUs
dual channel ddr3 is over here this is
another cool thing about z77 boards as
they support the ddr3 1600 megahertz J
Dex specifications so that means if you
have j deck modules that is like bone
stock modules that run at 1600 megahertz
they'll work completely zero
configuration in these boards here's the
DI the mem okay button so that allows
you to post pretty much no matter what
kind of memory you got in there you've
also got a 24 pin power connector and
the 8 pin power connector and they're
ideal locations along the right-hand
edge in the top left front USB 3.0 port
we kind of already harped on that
included SATA 2 3 gigabit per second
ports included SATA 3 6 gigabit per
second ports as well as two others say 2
3 6 gigabit per second port so two of
these are running off of the Intel
chipset for these ports Asus is using an
AZ media controller which while it
doesn't support their SSB caching that
we've seen on previous generation
products it is slightly faster than the
controller that does support the caching
we've got our epu as well as our T few
buttons remember this is for energy
efficiency this is for extreme
performance front panel connectors for
front USB 2.0 headers front panel USB 3
front panel audio as well as moving
along here ah yes ports that's top port
so we have 2 PCIe 1x slots 3 PCIe 16x
slots will do this guy is really only
good for a PCIe 4x and this guy is
really only good for PCIe 8x although
bear in mind pcie 3.0
8x is the same bandwidth as pcie 2.0 16x
so even if you're running to high-end
graphics cards here you're gonna have
plenty of bandwidth to legacy PCI ports
round out the seven slots that are
available oh yes
fan headers so you can use a CSS
software in order to control these fan
headers we have one two three four five
should be six where's the last one six
four pin pwm fan headers and we can set
all kinds of cool curves I believe it's
fan headers one to four that you can
actually use to use the auto tuning
software for on the back we find a ps2
port that's for keyboard or mouse I
still like to see these we've got four
USB 3.0 ports two USB 2.0 ports optical
audio out hdmi displayport VGA and DVI
are all included Intel Ethernet that's
how they're able to have that that
packet sorting included on all of their
z77 boards as well as 7.1 audio out on
the back of the board we find a little
bit of extra cooling for the vrm that's
definitely not for decoration as well as
little quality touches like installing
the tips that heatsink using screws
rather than pushpins so thank you for
checking out my unboxing and first look
at the p8z 77v pro don't forget to
subscribe to Linus tech tips from
unboxings reviews and other computer
videos and last but not least USB
charger plus allows you to quickly
charge your devices plugged into the USB
3 are the USB ports on this motherboard
even when the system is powered off and
one other thing I pretty much forgot is
the Thunderbolt header so asus is gonna
have available for their full line of
z77 boards with the exception of I
believe the WS board a PCIe 4x a riser
card that you can install in here and
then run a little cable over to the TB
header so you can add thunderbolt
compatibility to your board for a very
reasonable charge if you have a
thunderbolt rating device that you want
to use</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
