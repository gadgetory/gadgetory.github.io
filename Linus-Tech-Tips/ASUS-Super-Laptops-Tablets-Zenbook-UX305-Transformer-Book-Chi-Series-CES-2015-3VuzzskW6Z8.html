brought to you by phantom glass visit
store dot phantom dot glass for the best
iron screen protectors out there as well
as HyperX intel chips are finding their
way into all kinds of fantastic stuff
these days this is the transformer book
Qi actually the whole lineup but the one
I'm holding is the t9 d Qi it features
an Intel Bay Trail T processor clocked
at 1.4 six gigahertz it's got a 1280 by
800 IPS display so that's an 8.9 inch
LED backlit display it is phenomenally
thin actually just barely thick enough
actually had to add a little bit to the
thickness at the edge in order to get a
three-and-a-half millimeter Jack on
there it's got microSD expansion volume
rocker power switch and then micro USB
it's got side mounted speakers and some
pretty impressive specs given the $300
price it's got windows 8.1 it comes with
a year of office 365 one or two gigs of
memory I'm assuming the 2gig SKU is
gonna be a little bit more 32 or 64 gigs
of emmc storage and a rear five
megapixel camera with us front 2
megapixel camera it actually comes with
the Bluetooth keyboard dock that has a
little magnet in it that goes ahead and
clips on there and it features and
Wireless if you want to spend another
hundred dollars you're gonna step up to
yea I've totally got a cheat sheet here
because this is a lot to remember it's
three systems come on give me a break
here guys so I've got the t100 sheet
also ultra slim also fairly minimal IO
so you've got on this one on the left
side you've got your audio and micro USB
as well as your windows button and
volume rocker on the top you've got
power then over on the right ah very
nice now we've got micro HDMI a micro
USB 3 that it apparently comes with an
adapter that breaks out to a female USB
3 so you can go ahead and plug
high-speed peripherals into this as well
as a microSD expansion slot so with this
one you also get a larger screen so a
10.1 inch touchscreen with a 1920 by
1200 resolution also IPS but other than
that things are looking pretty much the
same and then this is the big kahuna
this is the t 300 this is a 12 and a
half inch display it's available in
either 2560 by 1440 or 1920 by 1080
depending on how much you want to pay so
it was $300 $400 and then this one is
either 700 or 800
depending on the resolution you want but
in addition to more screen size with
this one you also get a significantly
more powerful processor so this features
Intel's all-new 14 nanometer core M
processor as either the 5y 71 at 1.2
gigahertz or the 5y 10 at 0.8 gigahertz
you also get four or eight gigs of ram
Windows 8.1 you get 64 or 128 gigs of
storage you get a front 2 megapixel HD
camera no rear camera on this one
although if you're running around taking
pictures with a 12 inch tablet then you
probably need to re-examine what you're
doing with your life
it features 5300 Intel HD graphics and I
guess that's pretty much all there is to
say about it it also comes with the dock
oh yes and IO so on the left hand side
we've got power in as well as windows
button and volume rocker on the top
we've got a power switch on the right
hand side we've got micro HDMI as well
as micro USB with a breakout available
as well as an audio port then on the
very bottom you've got a micro SD slot
and the two magnetic clip ports that go
into the dock just like that but these
aren't the only stunningly thin Intel
powered devices there's one more we've
got to show you this is the one that's
really got my attention this is the new
Zenbook ux302 Broadwell processor which
is what enables it to be so stunningly
thin I mean about as thin as could
possibly be practical for a notebook I
mean there's rumors that the new MacBook
Air is gonna be so thin that it can't
even have a three-and-a-half millimeter
jack but that just feels kind of silly
to me this one you've got power in USB 3
super speed
you've got micro HDMI as well as a
headphone jack yeah we do need that
still and then on the other side two
more super speed USB 3 and an SD slot so
that enables it be super thin it also
gives an extremely long battery life
that's all they're quoting right now so
we don't know too much more but I guess
that stands to reason given we don't
know too much else about the specs so
you'll be able to get it with either a
core m 5y10
4 gigs or 8 gigs of ram 128 gigs or 256
gigs of storage and then where things
really get exciting is not not the
wireless AC so it comes with wireless AC
as well as HD 5300 graphics but the
display so the one that I have here
front of me is a mat I believe this is a
1080p display but it will also be
available in touchscreen flavors and
with up to a wqhd Plus display so that's
3200 by 1800 pixels and they're quoted
as saying the 3200 by 1800 model with
touch is going to be less than $1000 I
couldn't get any more clarification than
that like does less than $1000 mean
$9.99 or doesn't mean 989 or whatever
the case may be but one way or another
we're looking at an absolutely beautiful
notebook for under $1000 with a design
that would have cost us a couple grand a
few short years ago guys I hope you
enjoyed our video on the new Qi series
over there as well as the Zenbook ux302
the show is brought to you by phantom
glass so these guys really do make the
ultimate screen protectors for your
smartphone we've got the one on the
iPhone 6 right here that actually
features this is a prototype the one
that I'm using here it actually has like
a black front to it so it's completely
seamless feeling over the entire front
of the phone the great thing about these
is speaking of feel the way that they
feel is exactly like the Gorilla Glass
that's already on the surface of your
phone in terms of the oleophobic coating
the touch sensation as you drag your
finger across it as well as the clarity
because the screen protector itself is
made of Gorilla Glass and then has a
nano coating on the bottom that allows
you to apply it perfectly with no
bubbles absolutely effortlessly and even
take it off and reapply it should the
need arise so you can check them out at
store dot phantom dot glass linked in
the video description and I also want to
do a shout out to HyperX for allowing us
