to computex 2015 this year and also
thank you to Linda calm alright guys
welcome to the MSI booth where we will
be checking out the GT 72 to QE
Dominator pro in either the Toby IX
version or the g-sync version now the
basis for this laptop already exists out
in the market you can already buy it it
hasn't fifth-generation broadwell 5,700
HQ processor a 9 ATM from nvidia for the
graphics it has 4 m dot two slots one
two and a half inch slot with a one
terabyte hard drive in it you can raid 0
those for M two slots and as a 1080p
screen all that good stuff what's new
about these two models is that in the
g-sync model fairly self-explanatory it
comes with g-sync and in the Toby model
you have Toby eye-tracking Praia we'll
start with the back on the back you have
your dual exhaust one on each side you
also have a Kensington lock too many
display ports HDMI Ethernet and power on
the left-hand side you have two USB 3.1
jacks two USB 3.0 Jack's for three and a
half inch audio jacks and an SD card
reader on the right hand side you have a
blu-ray drive and dual USB 3.0 ports
what's new in both of these units is the
namek audio processing software and
killer networking 1535 wireless AC the
g-sync version has a g-sync module
inside of it which can help you remove
tearing and stuttering from your
gameplay this is something we've seen on
the desktop side for a very long time
but not something we've seen in laptops
until computex 2015 the Toby IX version
does not have G sync technology but has
the Toby steelseries eye tracking
technology in it you can actually see
right on the bottom of the bezel those
three little red lights that's your Toby
eye tracking now I've released a video
of Toby eye tracking from CES I think a
year or two ago when it was still under
development it's much easier to use now
the calibration system is much more
simple and they have a few cool things
like windows login where there's a huge
array of pictures and you just have to
look at your three password pictures and
then it lets you in that's pretty cool
also we were able to play assassin's
creed and some little like beat bouncing
look at the right circle thing game
which was kind of fun it's much more
seamless now the calibrations easier and
it's just a better overall
experience but I tracking still has a
little ways to go and speaking of little
ways to go the g-sync version of this
laptop will be available very soon and
the Toby IX version of this laptop will
be available not this year but probably
early sometime next year alright guys
