here this year we would not be at
Computex without them and also thank you
to Linda comm so the bulldog a lot of
you guys probably already have opinions
about this system to be completely
honest it's been quite covered so far
and we're on day one of Computex pretty
ridiculous but i guess that's kind of
Corsairs whole thing now looking at the
bulldog from the outside I think
everyone and their mom has an opinion
about how they probably don't like how
it looks I'm sure there's a few out
there that do like it but I'm not
necessarily in that camp either I had
some flashbacks of a crab the crab logo
came to mind it looks like a very wide
crab and I didn't like it but it doesn't
really matter they're going to be
designing more outside cases and that's
why sitting next to me here is more just
the inner framing of the bulldog what
actually really matters right now there
will be changes to this as well but the
main changes are probably going to be
happening to the outside you're probably
going to see a much more muted design
but we'll have to stay tuned and find
out how that goes another thing to note
is that the config can change
now whatever vendor you buy it from will
have their own config so new egg or n2x
or whoever the heck will have their own
set of components within the bulldog
chassis but Corsair will offer it with
the chassis an SF 600 power supply a not
yet determined motherboard and an H 5 SF
CPU cooler said motherboard will be
decided much closer to the release date
of skylake so stay tuned for that that
CPU cooler though is freaking cool it
has a freaking tiny rad you can actually
see it right here it's just the exposed
metal kind of showing part and then
across under the plastic right there it
doesn't go further into the actual
cooler which is just kind of a shroud
and the fan but that fan is interesting
it's a blower fan which has about 11
millimeters of pressure which is kind of
insane this this small unit equals about
the same cooling efficiency of an H 55
it doesn't have Corsair link is a tiny
freaking rad it has really high fin
density and a crazy fan which equates to
a pretty cool cooler especially because
this thing also mounts to the
motherboard
it doesn't actually mount to the outside
of the Bulldog which it kind of looks
like it does at first but it
not meaning that if they want to and
I've seen some expression that they
might they could sell this off by itself
and a lot of cases have venting just
over the i/o so this could work in
pretty much whatever you want pretty
effective little cooler and a very
low-profile another thing to note about
the CPU cooler is that you will need
relatively low profile ram as it's
fairly all-encompassing over the
motherboard across from the CPU cooler
you can see corsair link which is
obviously not required and doesn't
actually come with Corsairs bare-bones
system but you could add in yourself and
then the SF 600 watt power supply this
is interesting this is of course there's
first foray into sfx power supplies and
at 600 watts which is not a low wattage
at all pretty badass and this little guy
will be definitely sold on its own so
you're looking into home theater pcs you
can stay tuned for that in the more
vertical upper part of the rest of the
case you have your drive mounting now
here you can have three SSDs or one SSD
and a hard drive so you'd be available
to have essentially probably one fairly
insane SSD array or an SSD if your
operating system and some programs and a
hard drive for like your bigger files
and whatnot just below that as you can
now see we have the graphics card which
is actually cooled by an H 55 which is
something quite unique about this case a
lot of home theater pcs don't exactly
have options for water cooling a
graphics card a lot of home theater pcs
don't really have a lot of options in
terms of water cooling at all and in
this one you can water cool the CPU and
GPU now this is using Corsairs graphics
card mounting system you could use
whatever you want but definitely not a
bad idea another thing to note is to
kind of ignore those two included fans
they're there and they'll be that size
but they'll maybe not be exactly the
same I can't really say any more than
that for now just just hang with me on
that one so the CPU is cooled by a super
interesting new CPU cooler with 150 watt
TDP a blower style fan and a tiny little
rad with really dense fins which is
really interesting configuration the
graphics card is cooled in a home
theater box
there's tons of mesh all over the place
there's two intakes where for dedicated
fans there's this new power supply from
them what what's the point what's the
theme
well the oats
is ugly so we're going to ignore that
for now the whole theme behind this is
is cooling this is a crazy amount of
cooling for a home theater box and a lot
more than I expected coming into it but
does it matter
recently we released a video of a tiny
little home theater box that we fit a 16
core CPU which is hyper threaded into it
I think 64 gigs of RAM and a Titan X and
the temperatures were fine
well not necessarily the Titan X was
fairly hot because the Titan X is a
fairly hot card so this could solve that
problem also it was fairly quiet but it
wasn't the quietest machine out there in
this guy everything from Corsair
including the graphics card cooler is
under 30 DBS which is pretty damn good
last but not least it has a shielded
riser cable for that graphics card so
it's able to sit flat alongside the
motherboard and that will be in black
not the weird blue it currently is
speaking of the change there there will
be quite a few changes to the inside of
this not just the outside and with that
what do I think of the bulldog unusually
give opinions from events as I don't
think it's necessarily the greatest idea
but in its current state I'm not
necessarily a huge fan mainly due to
aesthetics but that's going to change
there's some internal things are going
to change as well I think this is going
to be an extremely important product if
nothing else home theater is a really
interesting segment and something that's
growing with stuff like steam box coming
out steam machines and all that kind of
stuff
and there's been a few players in the
space for a while now but Coursera seems
to come in two segments and just make
them absolutely explode look at the
all-in-one water cooling segment it
existed and then Corsair came around and
now it's freaking huge will they be able
to do the same with home theater pcs let
me know in the comments down below or on
twitter at Lucca underscore LFR thanks a
ton to msi for sending us here this year
we would definitely not be in Taiwan
right now if it wasn't for them so check
out their bitly link in the description
down below this video to see all the
products that they're launching at
Computex this year we'll hopefully be
checking those out shortly so we'll have
videos on them coming soon also thank
you to lynda.com check out their link
lynda.com that slash Computex for a 10
day free trial and start learning stuff
right away while you're commenting on
what you think about the Bulldog like
the video dislike the video
a favor the video subscribe all that
kind of stuff thanks for watching
today's inscribed Alliance tech tips if
you want to see all the rest of our
Computex 2015 content and I'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
