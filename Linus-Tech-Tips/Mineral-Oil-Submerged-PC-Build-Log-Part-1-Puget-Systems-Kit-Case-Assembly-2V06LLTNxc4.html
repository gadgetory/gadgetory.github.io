an exclusive pump design and their new
Silencio fans to provide impressive near
silent performance click now to learn
more so the first step would be to wash
your rocks then I guess that's kind of
always the first step isn't it
yep we both have to wash our rocks yeah
continue with this without washing the
rocks or else someone's gonna complain
it's just gonna be bad yeah yeah here so
are we sharing rocks well in this
situation where there's like two males
and one computer I guess we'll be
sharing rocks all right so these are the
rocks that we're talking about of course
it's good to rinse them because if you
don't then you might end up with some
gunk in your mineral oil machine spread
that apart just stick to threes and eat
some more fingers that's really hot
water is so hot water on cold rocks is
the way I like it
okay so now we're gonna take the freshly
cleaned rocks and go ahead and put them
outside to dry so it was it was sunny
literally an hour ago not even an hour
go like 15 minutes
yeah totally definitely not sunny
Vancouver so we don't want to
recontaminate the rocks so we're just
passing out these bins well to be honest
we are covering the bottles for the
babies in typical yeah but even then I
got how hundreds percent dry do they
need to be mystery mineral oil cooled
pcs well the more water content in your
computers a high chance that there's
gonna be a problem but the thing is
already even just now it would be fine
normally you could just leave these out
to dry for you know a couple days and it
would be fine but we're in a bit of a
hurry for what I did when I did mine was
I just used the strainer so they were
done drying like almost immediately
right and there's no real weight we
don't have a strainer at the office
because why would we have a strainer at
the office never know when you're gonna
need a strainer son so when I was doing
mine I cleaned all of my components with
a mineral oil bath it was in a container
similar to this but much shorter and my
reason for that was all of my components
were in a air-cooled system before they
went into mineral cool system so they're
all dusty and gross so one thing like
this cooler is we're gonna make sure we
clean this now I'm not super worried
about having it go through a mineral oil
bath the only reason why I did that
for all my components was making sure
that what they were going through wasn't
conductive as I was putting them in the
system almost immediately afterwards so
we can clean this with water alcohol
whatever as long as we make sure that
it's clean and dry before it goes in and
then everything else is pretty much new
isn't it everything else is pretty much
new but these these little fish things
it might not be a bad idea to clean them
because they've been sitting on a shelf
open right for a really long time but
like these closed components are
probably fine I don't think those would
be a big deal okay so
tanks washed take is wash these
I don't know there's so many little
pieces and stuff I don't know what goes
they know from looking at the picture
that the big one will be above the
mineral oil but yes the the backing some
of it will be submerged
definitely the the support braces these
guys those are the reasons okay well the
first thing we need to do though is peel
all the paper off these and then
assemble this bad boy because and then
we can wash it after assembly right yeah
should be fine okay so motherboard
IO plate is actually pretty nice got
that brushed finish there the inside is
nothing special but you won't see that
so yeah it's looking pretty good so far
sir what's up with these there's more
acrylic inside a bag inside a bag inside
of a bag figure that out later so I
realized looking at all these pieces I
don't know how they all go together and
they went right thank you we haven't
looked at it yet other than the front
cover so assembly instructions
dust your hardware before something
something act that none of that not
allow the oil in everything okay we're
gonna have to open this do tang I think
but there we go wow there's a whole like
list of all the stuff that you get
including a thermal display oh yeah pop
out oh this is looking good okay this
shouldn't be too bad
alright I guess we better get started
then as there are actually some very
very important things no robber
so no wires that use rubber insulation
don't let the oil get above 50 degrees
clean everything we did manage to figure
that out
don't power the pump if it's running dry
don't overfill it don't over tighten
screws use wireless devices when
possible this is really important whale
will wick along cables then it comes
into contact with so that's that's
pretty key and choose the correct type
of CPU cooler we actually haven't
checked this but having it aligned
vertically will help the oil circulate
through natural conduction also there
are evidently some things that we will
need so screwdriver got it
scissors got it wrench
got it okay so it starts with the Rio
Rio everything is handily
color-coordinated in the instructions
it's important not to over tighten the
screws into the acrylic because it will
crack hundred percent so this next steps
a little bit funny because there's an
unlabeled bag of screws and then there's
a an unlabeled screw in the key
everything else has little colored dots
so those do correspond to each other so
just put all four of these pieces into
place and then loosely attach them from
the other side we're just showing you
where they go obviously when we lift
this up they're all gonna fall off skew
fantastic
so Brandon won't let us use our camera
anymore and insists on shooting
everything in 4k so that's why the
sudden change in in quality for the
better and no more of this no more of
this selfie nonsense so so here we go
next step is to attach the evidently
white wire and wire handles these are
some pretty intense wires they got some
wire and that's some wire right there
going on okay so Brown screws I mean
what what does this mean to you put it
into the ground put the via and put the
screws in the grants private
Oh whoa hold on a second these aren't
the same I didn't even realize that okay
we did a lot of extensive research
before undertaking this project Luke
Luke hasn't built an oil cooled machine
in years and has definitely never used
this kit and I've never done either
either the ultimate machine in like
eight years
you got that think so assume the
position oh good wow that sound oh jeez
you know it's working okay we're good so
this is probably where the wrench comes
in so this is this hello this is not
what they had in mind I don't think but
our wrench is so big that we can
actually clear the entire thing going
this way so we need to clean the tubing
that came with it because we left it out
for a long time they've got kind of
gross and the idea was using a rod from
one of the soft boxes that we have gonna
use a rod but it's but it's the front
how Vedas I see if it was not long
enough really are you sure yeah see I
stuffed it in all the way it's it still
doesn't know that it's it's black right
yeah
so it's thick enough so we're probably
not gonna have any other options so our
problem is we don't have a long enough
rod we already tried the black one and
then there's no other options all right
we've had our first nut that's it that's
yeah so different low-level different no
label ones okay we should roll those
guys you want the fine thread and one
for your SSD not the coarse threaded no
label one for your SSD this not pass
so we're done part 1 at least we've
constructed the case and - now has
mineral oil fever I think he now
understands what it's like it's this is
really cool this kits really cool the
hardware we're using is really cool
we're going balls to the wall x99 1200
watt power supply GTX 780 we play this a
little while yeah EVGA provided us with
the graphics card before there were
certain other graphics cards available
but yeah anyway uh so guys stay tuned
for parts 2 &amp;amp; 3 make sure you're
subscribed like the video if you liked
it dislike it if you disliked it leave a
comment letting us know if your feelings
are more complicated than this and as
always check out the link in the video
description you can give us a monthly
contribution so we can spend it all on
things like oil we had to pay for our
own oil which is actually like pretty
expensive you can buy a cool t-shirt
like this one you can change your Amazon
bookmarks one with our affiliate code so
whenever you buy computer hardware oil
whatever else the case may be we got a
small kickback and I think that pretty
much wraps it up thanks for watching and
as always don't forget to see you guys
next time
ah I even knew the right one that time
but nope</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
