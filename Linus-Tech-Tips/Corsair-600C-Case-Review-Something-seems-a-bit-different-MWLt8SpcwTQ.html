releasing a new case or revision of a
case every month or so but it's been
about a year since then of course there
has not been just sitting on their ass
they've taken their time creating
something that's far from cookie-cutter
enter the Corsair 600 sea
freshbooks is the super simple invoicing
solution that lets you get organized
save time and get paid faster click now
to learn more the most immediately
notable thing about both the clear 600
CE and the quiet 600 CE are their
inverted layouts this while not an
original idea is a pretty damn cool
design decision that will set this case
apart from the vast majority of its
running mates in the 150 ish US dollar
price range you'd think that because the
power supply is at the top due to the
inverted motherboard that there wouldn't
be a basement and you'd be right but
that didn't stop Coursera from including
an attic which i think is actually
pretty damn cool but before we explore
the attic and the rest of the insides of
the case let's take a step back and
properly investigate the outside first
the front features a subtle and classy
design with the corsair sales logo in
the bottom right and a panel cutout in
the top that is held closed by two
magnets this panel conceals the two
available five and a quarter inch bays
which looking at most computer builds
these days you probably won't be using
the sides of the front bezel have
relatively large cutouts for airflow
reasons as there's some fan mounts just
behind this front panel the left side
panel on both versions is just a flat
clean surface with the right side panel
on the quiet version being the same
naturally however the clear version
mixes it up with a windowed right side
panel there's a latch on the left-hand
side near the front panel which quickly
and easily releases the door which sits
on hinges this is a pretty cool system
if you're someone who wants to show off
your handiwork also if you want to
remove the panel completely it's very
easy to lift off of its hinges but not
so easy that it's annoying and is just
going to randomly fall off the top of
the case is also mostly just a plain
panel - the i/o which includes two USB
2.0 2 USB 3.0 headphone and microphone
jacks a storage activity led a solid
feeling three speed fan controller and
satisfyingly clicky reset and power
buttons on the bottom we see the four
large feet supporting the case on
raising it off the ground for improved
air flow especially in carpeted areas we
also see that a large very large filter
is magnetically held in place and is
again a
to remove but not so easy that it just
falls off speaking of supporting the
case I did some structural integrity
tests and overall the case is really
solid the back features the power supply
mounting plate enabling you to install
the power supply through the back of the
case instead of from the inside which
also segues us perfectly into the attic
of the case not that I'd recommend it
but you can take the panel off that
hides your power supply and cable nest
by removing two screws from the back of
the case and then releasing the clips
from the bottom of the attic cover you
can also decide to leave the main large
panel in which will cover up the cable
nest and your optical drive bay area but
take out the smaller panel with the
Corsair sales logo in order to show off
your power supply also covered by this
attic panel but below the main shelf
platform are two three and a half inch
hard drive bays which slide in on more
of a platform than a rail system and
feel quite solid overall behind the
motherboard tray there are three tool
lists SSD trays which work really well
and make it super easy to install or
remove an SSD due to how they have a
little plastic bit pushing against it
from the top but then also a plastic
clip holding it in so it definitely
won't fall but if you want to remove it
it helps you help it below this there's
a large cutout for backside access to
your motherboard allowing you to install
back plates for CPU coolers super super
easily around the motherboard there's
cutouts for running cables most of which
have rubber grommets to help make your
cable management look all nice and
pretty no complaints about the actual
quality of the rubber grommets although
I do wish that those two bottom cutouts
had them as well you can fit a heatsink
that's 200 millimeters tall a power
supply that's 210 millimeters long and a
graphics card that is a whopping 370
millimeters long if you can find one you
can install up to a 240 or 280
millimeter radiator in the front a 140
millimeter radiator in the back and a
280 or three sixty millimeter radiator
in the bottom which is a pretty wicked
amount of cooling of course air just
wanted to go for air cooling here I
would have liked to see them ditch one
of the hard drive bays and both the
optical drive bays in order to make the
case about four ish inches shorter but
in its current
configuration it would be really easy to
set up a pretty wicked amount of water
cooling kit and it would look pretty
amazing due to the motherboard
orientation as well another thing to
note just as we close out here is that
the inside of the panels on the quiet
version are lined with sound dampening
material and the the clear one it has no
sound dampening material on the inside
in conclusion this case has overall very
solid construction and interesting and
fun motherboard layout and loads of
expansion options at a pretty decent
price for what you're getting if you
want a relatively standard looking case
outside but an interesting and funky set
up for the internals this may be exactly
