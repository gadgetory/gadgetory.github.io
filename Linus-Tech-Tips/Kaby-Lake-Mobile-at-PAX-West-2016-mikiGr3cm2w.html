Prime where they are showing off oh look
it's the razor blade stealth that
machine that I reviewed like weeks ago
and it's got a core i7 6500 u 8 gigs of
ram and it's like still super cool ins
connected to the to the razor core with
an external graphics card but that's not
what I'm interested in I want to know
what's under the display case over there
let's go find out ah yes it's the one
under glass that's always the one I'm
interested in and look at this razor
didn't put in the screws so there's a
rumor a little birdie told me that as
much as they as they've gone out of
their way to hide all the desktop icons
and make it so that I can't see the
Start menu that this machine is running
Intel's unreleased KB Lake series mobile
CPU hahaha yes it is oh there's a couple
interesting things here my friends I
have no idea how much of this I'm
allowed to show you so I'm gonna go with
all of it check this out we've got a
core i7 7500 u CPU in here so it's got a
base clock of 2.7 we don't really have a
way of knowing what it'll boost up to
unfortunately and they have addressed
Linus's big complaint about the blade
stealth probably because I complained it
has 16 gigs of RAM instead of 8 gigs of
RAM which means now it can run Chrome
right
very interesting I wonder what else we
can find out about it before anyone sees
me here it has a 1 terabyte SSD I
actually don't believe that was an
option that they offered on the previous
stealth I'm not getting any confirmation
one way or the other because razors
pretending they don't see me here I
really don't know what else I can say
about it let's have a look so physically
we've got HDMI and USB I wish I could
fire i-264 up on it or something so I
could at least tell you if it's like an
HDMI 2.0 port but I'm
guessing it probably is we can have a
look at display resolution though it
wouldn't surprise me if it's a 4k
display yup we've got a 4k display and
do they have synapse on here where's my
chroma lighting and they have not added
RGB lighting to the Razer logo on the
back yet so apparently some things are
still sacred actually wait if we do want
to know the clock speed we can just fire
up task manager and see what it's
sitting at right now because it's not
really doing much whoa
that's looking good so it's 2 cores 4
threads and it's turbo up to 3.4 5
gigahertz right now oh I just sprayed
spit on the screen so I think that's
pretty much it guys you saw it here
first we unboxed the Razer Blade stealth
and they're probably just gonna call it
the razor blade stealth aren't they
that's probably what they're gonna do
they're just gonna call it the razor
blade stealth but whatever it's the one
with the 7500 u and 16 gigs of ram in it
holy crap pretty cool so don't miss any
of our PAX West coverage here guys by

our videos you can do that in our

will see you again on the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
