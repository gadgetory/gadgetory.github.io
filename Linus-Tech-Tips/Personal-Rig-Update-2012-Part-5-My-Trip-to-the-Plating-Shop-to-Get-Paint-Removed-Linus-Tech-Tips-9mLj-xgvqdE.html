car so we're on my way to the plating
shop where I'm going to get the powder
coating stripped from any parts that are
already powder coated and then I'm also
going to be getting quotes on gold
plating the Copperhead blocks as well as
I'm going to get a quote on gold plating
the top piece of the Copperhead Ram or
doing the EVGA classified card I'm also
going to have the powder coating
stripped off the Apogee HD hold down
because it's a little bit scratched and
the rate is the same pretty much no
matter how many little things I do at
this point so I'm just bringing along
everything that I need and here we go
off to North Vancouver so here I am at
specialty plating it is a lot of my time
is it
8:05 so they told me to come by at
around 8:15 and they'll show me the
procedure so obviously a lot want to get
that on the camera for you guys that
they're going to use to strip the paint
off of my TJ oh seven parts so that's
going to be pretty cool and then another
thing that we're also going to do while
we're here is rotations on some of the
parts that I may or may not get the
plating changed or upgraded on yeah so
this will be interesting we're going to
head the side as soon as they as soon as
they get here at around quarter after so
I'm inside specialty plating now so
we've got a bunch of cool stuff going on
here these are the copper hooks that
they use to submerge these rods into the
various tanks they've also got a wide
variety of different chemicals so this
one right here was pointed out this is
the gold tank right here this one is the
reverse you're gonna have to remind me
sorry versatile system this is the
reverse electrolysis for Chrome and then
this guy is the caustic soda tank so the
caustic soda tank aha sodium hydroxide
can cause chemical burns it is really
bad and you should not even get that
close to it so I'm not going to be here
for long guys but this is what we're
going to be using essentially to strip
the powder coating off of my case so
this one right here is actually a
sacrificial piece that we're throwing in
the big tank just to show you guys what
happens but my case will actually be put
in a smaller non heated tank because the
metal actually can't handle the strain
of the of the large heated tank or for
an extended period of time that would be
required to remove all the paint and
grime and gunk so this tank they also
used to you use wait to use this one to
clean on any external
yeah so any external dirt so for example
after these guys are made of okay I
can't remember what these are made of
but these are cast iron so what they're
doing is they're polishing it up and
then you get a little bit of grime left
on it so before they can put it in for
nickel plating they use this tank for
that as well so guys it was only in for
about 30 seconds but you can see see the
powder coating has remained but I
actually painted the backs of these so
you can see the actual spray paint came
off almost immediately in that solution
so they're going to need some more time
with the powder coated parts and once
that's done I will be sending them off
to mountain mods for powder coating so I
think this pretty much covers the the
paint stripping portion of our video
don't forget to subscribe and thank you
for watching
actually I figure while I'm here I might
as well show you guys some of the work
that they do so I showed you these
polished pieces here that we're
preparing for cleaning so I probably
shouldn't be touching these they have a
dust cover on them so I'm not going to
get in trouble but I want to bring you
guys over to where these have come out
of the gold tank also the the gentleman
here who's showing me around showed me
the sulfuric acid tank he said the
reason they're not using that for my
case is that it can eat away at the
metal especially because I am using
particularly thin pieces of metal
designed for computer cases rather than
you know automotive or anything like
that so let's come over here and have a
look at a more of a finished product so
these are those pieces that we looked at
just now before but with gold plating
and these are polished right as well
yeah these are polished as well so you
can see the level of reflectiveness in
these materials it looks just
outstanding so that's one of the reasons
why I'm also thinking of getting some
gold plating done for the build to go
with the Apogee HD limited edition water
bloggers oh and he's bringing me over
here now too apparently there's even
more good stuff there's also glue but
you can't really see the gold
because of the lightning ball it's hard
to see that yeah it's hard to see the
goal but the lights better over here
I don't want to wreck the packaging or
anything but yeah you can see they
actually do quite a bit of different
plating work you can go to their site
just google specialty plating so they're
in North Vancouver it's a bit of a trek
for me but I've dealt with these guys
before on a previous project and even
though we didn't manage to to get it
done they were very accommodating
throughout the whole process so here I
am back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
