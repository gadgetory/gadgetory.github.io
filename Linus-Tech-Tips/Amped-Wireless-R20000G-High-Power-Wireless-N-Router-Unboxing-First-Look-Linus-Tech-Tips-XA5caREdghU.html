product this is the amped Wireless high
power Wireless n 600 milliwatts
dual band router the model numbers
actually are 20,000 G designed in the US
by ant Wireless so what is amped
Wireless well it's a dual band router
which allows you to share your broadband
internet connectivity wirelessly over
extreme distances very cool for high
power amplifiers and too high gain
antennas provide wall penetrating Wi-Fi
so this is a penetrating router
simultaneous 2.4 gigahertz and 5.0
gigahertz and 600 dual band Wi-Fi speed
suit is a simultaneous penetrating
router we also have a diagram of how it
might be set up including a label of the
broadband modem which is goes in sort of
like here and then the wired
connectivity that you have here your low
range you know this here and then your
high range this that goes like clear
outside of the building that they have
diagrammed here so what is this ideal
for up to 10,000 square feet so this
should in theory cover an entire large
residential property with usable
wireless signal very cool I great for
large homes offices and apparently even
outside 2.4 / 5 gigahertz dual band okay
range increase guarantee and you can use
a QR code to see their range increased
guarantee free Wi-Fi analytics tool
available in the Android Market that's
kind of cool as well although there are
free Wi-Fi analytics tools they have
three models so the differentiation
generally comes down to you know I think
one of them doesn't have gigabit
actually worth it okay was this the good
diagram I don't know yeah basically it
comes down to speed they're all powerful
they're not all dual-band and then I
think one of them doesn't have gigabit
ports yeah so that's the main thing
right over here
you know let's start getting it open
first before we spend too much more time
on the outside of the box the key
features extreme range ultra powerful
guest networks create up to four guest
Wi-Fi networks which is a lot more
relevant when you can transmit your
Wi-Fi signal over 10,000 square feet
with your entire building Wi-Fi coverage
control you can adjust the distance of
your wireless network to make sure that
it's not going further than you wanted
to parental / security features look
it's small - cool Oh apparently this
comes pre-wired no way so instead of
including a setup guide which quite
frankly you know has been done to death
they just connected for you how do you
nee
sorry moving right along it has QoS so
quality service prioritizing your
bandwidth to eliminate leg for games
VoIP and streaming gigabit networking
powerful processor for faster wired and
wireless networking yes the processor in
your router does make a difference
there's more to it than just specs and
features USB storage support so you can
share files from USB storage device that
is only for the high end one as well if
I recall correctly USB port yep there it
is and the dual band USB and just sort
of general awesomeness ok so let's have
a look at the way that they set this up
so I thought this was like you know I
thought this was like a special thing
that they're doing because it's like an
immediate unit but here you go connect
to pc connect to modem this is so simple
that my mum could do it and they even
include two different colors so like
there's no way to screw it up in fact
I'm willing to bet they even just say
like plug the blue one into the thing
from your internet service for that's
awesome ok well since we're already
doing this anyway why don't we cover the
rest of the unit itself before we go
into the documentation that's something
that's about a couple things that
alright let's say attach the antenna
before connecting the power adapter to
this device ok so you want the antennas
on here before you actually turn it on
okay that's good to know
on the back of it we've got our okay I'm
just gonna move these because they're
sort of in my way right now but I still
think it's cool ha power to antennas
gigabit ethernet modem port WPS so quick
setup reset switch and USB for storage
soft touch finish on the top as well as
ventilation which I'm sure it needs more
than most routers do too
high-power nature of it on the bottom we
find yeah all of your factory default
settings BAM IP address web login login
and password SSID security key
everything right there on the bottom
very convenient because normally I would
actually write it all out and put it to
the bottom myself lots of ventilation
holes again on the bottom of the unit as
well as here at the back of the top and
right on the top of it okay so this is a
setup guide which they want you to read
first imagine that stop thank you for
purchasing purchasing this amped
Wireless product use the back of this
form to check the contents of the
package record configuration settings
look at that you can write it down and
put it somewhere else too so they make
it very convenient for you
very neat if anything's missing in the
package please contact us immediately
here is your set-up guide which they
want you to read first it isn't color
and it is extremely long okay just act
and powerful well look at this look how
complete this is they even include the
steps for getting rid of your old one
which I don't think I've ever seen in a
setup guide before and your web browser
welcome to the smart setup wizard
connect your internet connection
configure your this and that moving
right along to the back how to connect
wirelessly to the high power writer so
how to set up the router how to connect
to it including different operating
systems and and like the one touch setup
this is really cool how to share USB
storage devices troubleshooting tips
problems and solutions very very
thorough love it Wi-Fi analytics tool so
there's your free download meet seeking
shows you Wi-Fi scanner to premiere by
networks channel graphed playing the
numbers on the channel numbers so that
you can select the right channels with
the least interference channel
interference analyzer signal graph and
signal meter very cool and finally a CD
that does all that no away check this
out this CD is not required for setup
BAM but it does include an insta
video which was very neat on the back so
they talked performance comparison
standard Wi-Fi router Wow high powered
dual band router and standard Wi-Fi
router output Wow this router output so
standard Wi-Fi router antennas wow this
router so they're really emphasizing
this whole like uber high power thing
and I can see why they would because
personally I'm far more excited about
this than I am
about things like range extenders
because yes I need more wireless
coverage but I don't necessarily want
the hassle of a bunch of more devices so
this is very cool I dropped the thing
thank you for checking out my unboxing

dual band gigabit high powered router
