it fell at the fantex pH tc9 DLS this is
a low profile cooler from fantex
and the last cooler we looked up from
them was anything but low profile was
like a huge plague tower thing and came
in a variety of colors let's see what
they have to say for themselves about
this one so supports LGA 2011 LGA 1155
and 11:56 it's low growl it's a low pro
that some low profile LGA 2011 cooler
especially given there's like six core
processors on there so their patented
physical antioxidant thermal shield
technology dramatically increases the
cooling performance and reliability by
deflecting thermal radiation from other
heat sources non-toxic able to withstand
temperatures up to 200 degrees this is
only 27 millimeters taller 45
millimeters of the fan incompatible
small form-factor cases with a 45
millimeter clearance the three six
millimeter heat pipes are aligned to
ensure optimal I can even see the heat
pipes okay the pH f9d pelion premium fan
uses you updraft floating balanced
bearing
I've never even heard of that before so
I guess that makes it quiet eliminates
vibration and provides a simple solution
for quiet and smart fan control takes
only less than a minute to install
thanks to the provided mounting kit
normally requires four screws and made
of high purity yes their thermal
compound is like a diamond compound like
something like an icy ICS compound cold
plasma spraying spraying coating
technology as a new innovative deposit
that transfers heat onto corresponding
metals at a more rapid rate enhances the
thermal contact if attea the soldered
connectors and whatnot in hooha
let's see what kind of a TDP it's rated
up to it looks like we don't ah yeah up
to 130 watt TDP so in theory this thing
can handle six cores after a floating
balanced bearing up to from 1000 to 2500
rpm and at 19 to 26 decibels is the
actual rated thing we got going so
here's this floating bearing fan which
I'm sort of interested to check out so I
guess so it's something to do with the
actual force that it exerts down on sort
of the
lifts it a little bit and reduces the
overall friction so that's sort of neat
I don't know how well that would work
sideways or sideways or would it yeah I
know I should still move it away so okay
here's a backplate for LGA 1155 and
11:56 very sturdy very thick that's
about what you'd want okay more more
packing materials here more accessories
in a box that's what we got so I guess
more mounting gear so here is an
accessory for presumably fan mounting
okay next is screws for LGA 1155 and
11:56
and finally screws for LGA 2011 then a
nice big thing of included thermal
compound very nice okay now we have
there we go heatsink itself which is
okay how exactly does this work so
there's in theory three heat pipes in
there here maybe you'll be able to see
them a little bit better down there so
there's a thick base that has there too
you can see that these aren't just bare
metal these have that coating that
they're talking about that
apparently reflects heat away from this
and then also allows heat to be
conducted more more better sort of off
of them by the air so you melt this just
by using the included bits of pieces so
you kind of have it on there and they're
saying they're saying this thing's
capable of cooling a six-car the basis
machine smooth so you can do the
obligatory sort of finger shot and here
thing and then it's a sort of a raised
base and then attached to the larger
base that actually also acts as a
mounting plate and this sort of merits
some some testing at some point in the
future here guys to find out how well
this could handle something like a six
core because I mean in something like
our shuttle PC over there that has an
extreme edition in it something like
this if it performs better than the
included cooler could be absolutely
amazing and would make more space for
cable management and for cooling of
other components inside the case as well
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the fan tax
pH TC 90
which is a low-profile cooler for Intel
sockets it also includes a little
instruction manual here that gives you
all the information you need about how
to install the fan clips and all of that
