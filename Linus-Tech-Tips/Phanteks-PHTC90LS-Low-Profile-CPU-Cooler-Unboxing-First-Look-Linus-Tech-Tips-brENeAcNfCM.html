it fell at the fant XP HTC 9d LS this is
a low profile cooler from fantex and the
last cooler we looked at from them was
anything but low profile was like a huge
plague tower thing and came in a variety
of colors let's see what they have to
say for themselves about this one so
supports LGA 2011 LGA 1155 and 1156 its
slope wow it's a low profile low profile
LGA 2011 cooler especially given there's
like six core processors on there so
their patented physical antioxidant
thermal shield technology dramatically
increases the cooling performance and
reliability by deflecting thermal
radiation from other heat sources
non-toxic able to withstand temperatures
of up to 200 degrees this is only 27
millimeters tall or 45 millimeters of
the Fanning compatible small form-factor
cases with a 45 millimeter clearance the
36 millimeter heat pipes are aligned to
ensure optimal I can't even see the heat
pipes ok the pH f9 deep elem premium fan
uses you updraft floating balance
bearing I've never even heard of that
before so I guess that makes it quiet
eliminates vibration and provides a
simple solution for quiet and smart fan
control takes only less than a minute to
install thanks to the provided mounting
kit it only requires four screws and
made of high purity yes their thermal
compound is like a diamond compound like
something like an icy ICS compound cold
plasma spraying spraying coating
technology is an innovative deposit that
transfers heat on to corresponding
metals at a more rapid rate enhances the
thermal contact if attea the soldered
connectors and whatnot and hoo-hah let's
see what kind of a TDP its rated up to
it looks like we don't ah yeah up to 1
30 watt TDP so in theory this thing can
handle six cores updraft floating
balance bearing up toots from 1000 to
2500 rpm and at 19 to 26 decibels is the
actual rated thing we got going so
here's this floating bearing fan which
I'm sort of interested to check out so I
guess so it's something to do with the
actual force that it exerts down on sort
of the
air lifts it a little bit and reduces
the overall friction so that's sort of
neat I don't know how well that would
work sideways or sideways or would it
yeah I know I should still move it away
so okay here's a back plate for LGA 1155
and 1156 very sturdy very thick oops
about what you'd want okay more more
packing materials here more accessories
in the box and that's what we got so I
guess more mounting gear so here is an
accessory for presumably fan mounting
okay next is screws for LGA 1155 and
1156 and finally screws for LGA 2011
then a nice big thing of included
thermal compound very nice ok now we
have there we go heat sink itself which
is ok how exactly does this work so
there's in theory three heat pipes in
there here maybe you'll be able to see
them a little bit better down there so
there's a thick base that has there too
you can see that these aren't just bare
metal these have that coating that
they're talking about that apparently
reflects heat away from this and then
also allows heat to be conducted more
more better sort of off of them by the
air so you mount this just by using the
included bits and pieces so I'm just
going to have it on there and they're
saying they're saying this thing is
capable of cooling a six-car the bases
machine smooth so you can do the
obligatory sort of finger shot here
thing and then it's a sort of a raised
base and then attached to the larger
base that actually also acts as a
mounting plate and this sort of merits
some some testing at some point in the
future here guys to find out how well
this could handle something like a
6-core because I mean in something like
our shuttle PC over there that has an
extreme edition in it something like
this if it performs better than the
included cooler could be absolutely
amazing and would make more space for
cable management and for cooling of
other components inside the case as well
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing and first look at the fantex pH
TC 9
DLS which is a low-profile cooler for
Intel sockets it also includes a little
instruction manual here that gives you
all the information you need about how
to install the fan clips and all of that
