the blue team you need it but there are
so many options from 21 33 to 40 to 66
megahertz but could it possibly be worth
emptying your wallet for the fastest
memory on the market let's find out
we're opening up a new merch store you
can check out some of our new gear today
at the link in the video description
first a primer on ramp ddr4 is the
latest version of the form of DRAM that
our computers almost universally use
programs get loaded into it from our
SSDs and hard drives because it's
blazing fast performance is needed to
feed our CPUs data to munch on turn in
those ones and zeros into game's boring
PowerPoint presentations or this video
that you're watching right now cool so
the faster the ramp the better the
performance right not quite there comes
a point where even if you could
force-feed your CPU more data it
couldn't possibly chew through it fast
enough to make a difference so the sweet
spot as always probably lies somewhere
in the middle we just need to find it
let's establish a baseline here the
joint electron device engineering
council or j deck for short specifies 21
33 megahertz for ddr4 while on both
intel's z 270 and x 99 platforms running
anything over ddr4 2400 megahertz is
outside the official spec AMD for their
part has specified a range of speeds
with the most frequently used
configuration also sitting at 2400
megahertz but wait a minute what well
why the heck are companies like g.skill
advertising speeds that are up to almost
double that well the answer is
sanctioned overclocking intel's extreme
memory profile or XMP for short has
become something of an industry standard
for running high-end memory - it's rated
spec on supported motherboards every
rare module even the highest end XMP
ones then have the j deck standard
speeds baked in then along with that a
faster XMP profile that stored on a chip
that identifies each individual module
in a standard that's called serial
presence detect or SPD for compatibility
reasons J deck comes first and it's only
when you specifically enable XMP in your
computer's bios that it will run at
those speeds or at least in theory it
will we've had tons of issues over the
years most recently during the Rison
seven launch where we couldn't get past
twenty six sixty six megahertz no matter
what Asus AMD or g.skill said our board
with our memory has since been fixed
which is great with a firmware update
but sanctioned overclocking is still
overclocking and it can cause these
kinds of issues from chip to chip or
board to board or Ram stick to Ram stick
depending on your luck it can also cause
less severe but equally annoying issues
to crop up at random at some point in
the future but whatever line is enough
for this warning label crap I'm prepared
to spend a weekend bashing my head
against the wall troubleshooting my new
gaming rig so tell me what do I stand to
gain for my pain great question we
tested a variety of configurations on
AMD the maximum we could achieve was BDR
for 3200 and on Intel we hit thirty six
hundred megahertz before we just stopped
turning the dial because spoiler alert
well no wait actually you know you'll
see using 21 33 megahertz as a baseline
we ran Deus Ex mankind divided and rise
of the Tomb Raider in both DirectX 11
and DirectX 12 modes from games clearly
won't care much about RAM speeds but
others can end up being more memory
sensitive than we'd initially expected
in for honor average frame rates looked
to be within margin of error regardless
of Ram speed but looking closely err the
97th percentile minimum frame rate does
see
you have been affected as far as
synthetics go we tested 7-zip the RAM
hungry why cruncher Cinebench r15 and
asus real bench where we had much more
consistent results if by consistent we
mean eerily similar across the board
which leads us then into the price and
performance summary in almost every case
the largest improvement in performance
over 2133 is achieved by 26 66 megahertz
then there's another modest improvement
when you jump to 3200 and from their
marketing and purely synthetic
benchmarks aside things go downhill
pretty quickly on both Intel and AMD
leaving us to conclude that there's no
point going higher even if you could so
then by 30 200 megahertz ram since
that's the sweet spot right well well
sure but it actually depends to what
kind of a budget you're working with for
your system if you've already got the
best of everything then shared yeah you
might want to go higher on your RAM to
eke out that slim improvement but if
you're on any kind of fixed budget well
for 64 bucks the difference between 21
33 and 3600 Ram you could go from a core
i5 7500 to a 7600 K netting you higher
CPU clock speeds and overclocking
support or from arriven 5 1500 X to a
1600 X giving you 2 whole additional
processing course and that only accounts
for the financial investment but we
haven't even talked about is the time
that this can end up consuming and going
back again to look at the total possible
improvement from a bare-bones J deck
21:33 kit to the fastest we tested the
full conclusion becomes crystal clear
4.7 percent
for $64 more without any guarantee that
it'll actually work means that we
wouldn't recommend it unless you're out
of stuff to spend money on that will
give you more meaningful performance or
usability improvements and you have not
only the time and know-how to tinker
with it but also the patience to drop
everything and deal with it
when something isn't working and this is
especially true if you're using the
latest and greatest platform with that
fastest and shiniest Ram tunnel bear is
the simple VPN app that makes it easy to
browse the internet more privately and
securely you just turn it on it's like
really really easy you press like one
button and boom your connection gets
encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption
and you appear to the services and
websites that you use as though you are
coming from a completely different
country which in many cases allows you
to use services that would otherwise be
geo blocked another cool thing is that
your isp
can track exactly what it is that you're
doing online tunnel bear has a top rated
privacy policy and you can try it for
free with five hundred megabytes and no
credit card required and you can get 10%
off by going to tunnel bear comm slash
LTG so thanks for watching guys if this
video sucked you know what to do but if
it was awesome get subscribed hit that
like button or check out the link to
where to buy the stuff we featured in
the video description also down there is
our merch store which ow oh fruit which
has cool shirts like this one and our
community forum which you should totally
join</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
