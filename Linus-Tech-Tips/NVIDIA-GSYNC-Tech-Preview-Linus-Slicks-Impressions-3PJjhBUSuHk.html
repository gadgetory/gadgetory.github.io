preview and while I will be doing on
boxing the monitor inside this box is an
Asus VG 248 q e that has been modified
to have it scaler replaced by an Nvidia
g-sync module it is not a finished
product and therefore we won't be
evaluating the merits of this monitor
specifically but rather the technology
in general so without getting too
technical and boring here let's talk
about what g-sync is and why we need it
a graphics card renders each frame of
your game as fast as it possibly can
then makes it available to your monitor
monitors typically by contrast operate
on fixed refresh intervals they will
grab whatever is available to them at
the exact time that they are ready to
refresh in a perfect world the video
card would render exactly one frame just
before the monitor was ready for each
refresh and we'd see beautiful smooth
animation the problem is that different
frames and games can be rendered in
different amounts of time looking at the
floor for example is much less demanding
than looking at a suddenly exploding
vehicle that means that in the real
world the framerate output by your
graphics card doesn't match the refresh
rate of your monitor vsync or vertical
sync forces the graphics card to wait
around for the monitor to be ready
before it sends a rendered frame with
frames being delivered at even intervals
animation appears a much smoother even
if the framerate isn't that great C 24
frames per second movies as an example
this is great until something demanding
comes on screen and the frame rate drops
below the refresh rate of the monitor in
most cases this will be 60 Hertz when
that happens one image will stay on
screen for two whole monitor refreshes
this is perceived as a stutter in the
animation on top of that vsync also
introduces additional input lag meaning
that the delay between when you move
your mouse and when the image on-screen
reflects your movement is increased some
game engines handle this better than
others but for example I just plain
couldn't play
for dead with vsync on it was just too
laggy so why not just turn vsync off
well then we end up with a visual
anomaly called tearing the GPU outputs a
frame as soon as it's done but if the
monitor is in the middle of drawing an
image on the screen already we'll end up
with multiple different frames on the
screen at the same time this manifests
as vertical objects being out of
alignment in extreme examples like this
one you can actually see more than two
frames on-screen at the same time in
practice this is extremely distracting
to look at but I like many gamers out
there have simply learned to suck it up
because I'd rather get screen updates as
soon as they're available and have it
look stupid rather than be looking at
something pretty on my screen that
happened on frame ago now on to this guy
g-sync
it allows your monitor to wait for your
graphics card to be ready to deliver a
new frame and update itself at that
exact moment this eliminates the leg and
stuttering associated with vsync on and
low frame rates and it eliminates the
tearing associated with vsync off and
high frame rates because we never need
to output multiple frames to the screen
during a single refresh alright so it
sounds magical what do I need well
you'll need a decent compatible graphics
card a GTX 650 TI boost or higher has to
be Kepler based until Maxwell launches
next year you'll need a g-sync monitor
like this one with the G sync module
built-in although there may be some
upgrades available for this particular
model later on you know depending what
happens you'll also need a DisplayPort
connection on your graphics card a
DisplayPort cable and you'll need to use
the DisplayPort input on your monitor
all right Linus so you're asking for a
pretty big investment here show me what
it can do well that's a problem I can't
really show you because in order to
experience the smoothness of g-sync
every part of the chain needs to support
it if I were to use a capture card or
take a high-speed video of g-sync
running my capture card or camera would
operate at exactly 60 FPS then it would
be played back on your 60 Hertz monitor
and you'd be able to see that there's no
tearing but you'd see frame doubling
during performance tips as
if we were just recording gameplay with
regular vsync on I could just record
footage of games running with no tearing
but that's only part of the experience
you have to try it to really understand
it I'm hoping to work with Nvidia to do
a live meetup where viewers can come and
try g-sync for themselves but I think
that's still a little ways off
speaking of understanding g-sync there
are some misconceptions about the
technology that I would like to clear up
things you don't even have to be there
in person to understand so number one is
that other than this particular model
which has like a g-sync module DIY
upgrade coming aftermarket modding of
monitors to add the functionality is
extremely improbable would require
extensive modifications to the monitors
internals and distinct someone figures
it out great but I wouldn't count on it
number two a sous does not have any kind
of exclusivity on g-sync in 2014 i'm not
really sure where this came from
number three g-sync will work on any
panel size TVs monitors you name it it's
a matter of time before we even start to
see it on VR devices and phones and
whatnot like kind of mobile devices and
stuff like that number 4g sync will work
with light boost compatible monitors or
with non light news compatible monitors
at this time g-sync
and the low persistence mode that folks
have been running on light boost
monitors don't work at the same time but
that may change in the future
number five G sync will work on 60 Hertz
120 Hertz or whatever Hertz panels the
fixed refresh rate of the monitor simply
becomes the maximum refresh rate number
five or six not sure G sync will work
with any panel resolution the sample
here is 1080p but there's no reason
g-sync couldn't work at 1440p or even 4k
I've also had quite a few folks ask
about G sync on AMD and there are many
conflicting reports but all I really
have to say right now is that there's no
real evidence that Nvidia is planning to
provide a license to AMD in any way
shape or form last one is what about SLI
and surround SLI will work just fine and
gsync the master card that is plugged
into your display will dictate what
refresh rate the monitor should run at
and as for surround at this time it
should be just fine if you have three
matching monitors although there may be
some driver rican
Malaysian that may enable you to have
g-sync here not g-sync there but that's
kind of up in the air at the moment so
you've got most of the information now
let's take a look at why I believe this
will be extremely hard for NVIDIA to
sell one day we're going to look back at
non g-sync monitors and we're going to
laugh
going back to tearing stuttering and leg
will feel like ancient technology but
with that said g-sync
is going to be a tough sell for Nvidia
because we're all used to living without
it let's look at another recent paradigm
shifting change in PC hardware
solid-state drives at least with an SSD
you can benchmark them versus a hard
drive and show people the numbers but
even then many insisted well I don't
mind waiting another two seconds blah
blah blah it's expensive who cares but
ask yourself this if you've gone SSD in
the last couple of years in fact leave a
comment on the video and tell me about
this how hard is it when you have to go
back and use a hard drive based system
now particularly when it's not a refresh
OS and you have to do some real work on
it that is how we're all gonna feel
about g-sync in a while so I'd actually
like to take a moment here to let Luke
give his thoughts on g-sync so you can
hear more than just my opinion the fact
that we had one in-house and we were
able to try it was awesome when I
finally got my hands on gsync the first
thing I did was grab a copy of
Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag and run
around the Abstergo hallways because in
those hallways I found some of the worst
tearing I've ever seen and I noticed
what g-sync no tearing also no mouse
input lag which is a big thing because
with g-sync
you're not compromising anything for the
awesomeness of g-sync and I find that to
be the biggest deal with g-sync I don't
think a bunch of people are going to run
out and get this but I think in the
future it's going to be really nice
because you can get all the awesomeness
of these technologies we don't have a
sacrifice lag which is a big reason why
a lot of people don't run it so let's be
clear guys this is just a tech preview
it's not a full review but there are
still some conclusions that we can draw
so having tried it myself outside of in
videos conference controlled environment
and having talked to Luke about it off
camera I think our feelings about it are
fairly similar I don't think everyone
will or even necessarily should rush out
and buy all the necessary components on
the day the
are available and completely replace
perfectly good hardware some of the
hardcore guys will and that's cool
you're going to have a better gaming
experience but I think that the more
likely scenario is that the next time
you're at a natural upgrade point for
your monitor or your graphics card
you're going to want to carefully
consider g-sync capability when you're
making your purchasing decision at this
point another very important conclusion
is that I cannot recommend while I can't
recommend a monitor to buy I can
recommend what not to buy
don't buy anything until quarter one
next year when we have a clearer idea of
what will or what won't be available if
g-sync because the most important thing
here is to make sure that you're making
an educated decision and right now we
just don't quite know enough so stay
tuned guys we're going to definitely
have more content on this we're going to
be covering it at CES we're going to be
covering it once there's retail
availability of the proper finished
hardware and as all these guys like the
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it leave the comment let me
know how you felt about it and as always
