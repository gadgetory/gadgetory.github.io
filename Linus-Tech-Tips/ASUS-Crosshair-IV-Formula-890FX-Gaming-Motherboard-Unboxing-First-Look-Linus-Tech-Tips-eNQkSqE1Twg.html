I've received to unbox the asou republic
of gamers crosshair for formula
motherboard and here it is
so this motherboard is featuring AMD's
latest 890 FX chipset and that means
full support for phenom ii x4 x3 and not
pictured here but also they're brand new
fennan to x6 processors it has support
for ATI crossfire X technology of course
this board so it uses a very new sort of
styling for Asus anywhere they've got
kind of a it's hard to describe it but
kind of an angular structure to their
heat pipes we'll have a closer look at
those when we get the board actually
unboxed but it uses the black and red
and white color scheme that we're used
to with Republic of gamers boards so
let's have a look up here at the top
first of all we've got the ROG connect
plug and overclock tweak it the hard
core away so this part right here is for
plugging in the ROG Kinect peripheral
which you can use to overclock your
system game first the speed you need to
pone that is awesome and we will figure
out what exactly that means but it
appears to be the the onboard buttons
here one of which is an overclock button
one of which is a core unlocker button
then you've got onboard start and reset
buttons next we have mem okay any memory
is okay its cameraman wants to go look
at those fine there they are
okay and then we have mem okay which is
a pretty neat feature you can take any
high-performance memory and you use this
button to make sure that it'll post
successfully in the board before you go
in and adjust all of the timings to
their extreme timings then we have
supreme FX x5 built in so you've got
built-in support for all of creatives XP
technologies that's pretty nice to have
for an onboard audio solution let's go
around to the back of the box and see if
there's anything that we didn't already
see and there is not so let's get it
opened up and have a look
the accessories that are included with
the crosshair for formula all right no
no if I could get this box out and I
would be able to talk to you about the
accessories that are included with the
crosshair for formula there we go
so the top one contains the board and
then the bottom one contains the
accessories thumbs open next black box
here and everything very nice so where
should we start let me start with the
i/o shield it has a Seuss's trademark
black Republic of gamers i/o shield with
their puffy silvery stuff on the inside
next we have the ROG connect cable which
is just a USB cable next we have a
crossfire bridge it's kind of funny to
see that included with a motherboard
rather than with a video card normally
it comes with the video card but hey
having an extra one never hurts you got
a few zip ties to do some cable
management there you've got their cue
connectors so if your case is kind of
old and doesn't come with a proper brick
USB connector then this is a great way
to plug it in also for your front panel
switches you can plug them into this
little connector and then you can take
the whole thing and plug it right into
the motherboard next we've got the
manual or the user guide I guess I could
call it which has a whole bunch of stuff
in it why don't we get to that in just a
second let's go through the rest of the
cables so we have an eSATA USB 2.0
bracket for the back and then six SATA
cables three of which are right angle
and three of which are straight so each
package contains one right angle and one
straight SATA cable and then you've got
your Republic of gamers sticker that you
could put on your case or your cat or
whatever you want to it's big put it on
your car if you really wanted to I guess
that'd be pretty sweet
cruising down and you're like sweet ride
with a Republic of gamers sticker on the
side of your car yeah
wish I had some shades of only talked
about that feel like cool anyway so we
have the drivers and utilities DVD don't
use this download the latest off the SCS
website then we have the user's guide
which includes a bunch of stickers and
information so these stickers are for
labeling your SATA cables pretty cool
they have a little diagram here for how
to do it hard drive one boot disc you
wrap it around your cable label it at
both sides you will never be lost for
which cable goes where ever again
very neat feature and then we have a
little pamphlet talking about turbo
unlocker on-demand real-time system
tuning so optimized CPU core loaded
turbo and Locker is the next evolution
of an exclusive this is performance
boost feature one click and the turbo
vivo interface automatically and
dynamically just each to speed up
performance okay so basically what
they're doing is they're speeding up
particular cores based on how much load
is on that core that's what they're
trying to do so if you have one core
that's being used heavily by a game for
example and another one that's being
used just a little bit in the background
then it'll adjust the frequency of the
cores based on that sounds like a neat
feature so here we go let's get the
board opened up here a user's guide
there and here it is that is one shiny
looking motherboard like not literally
shiny but shiny like like cool like cool
shiny alright so the first thing we will
find in the middle is wow this it's
actually heavier than most motherboards
to be perfectly honest with you I think
it's these huge heat sinks that it has
on it like the board has some real heft
to it so these are like you know what
I'm gonna talk about the heat sinks
first since I'm oh no there's a
backplate oh look we've got voltage
regulators on the back it's only when
they're using tons of phases that you
typically see that kind of stuff on the
back of the motherboard ok so moving
around to the front we've got kind of
these angular looking mosfet north
bridge south bridge coolers i think
they're very very cool and here
cameraman maybe you can adjust the
camera to get kind of a good look at
them
it's hard to really describe what this
style is like I was calling their old
stock
like fortress of solitude style I don't
really know what to call this but it
looks very futuristic and sleek I really
like it you've actually got a heat pipe
connecting this heat sink to the
Northbridge heat sink down to the
Southbridge heat sink so you got one
flat heat pipe running there so make
sure that everything stays nice and cool
honestly there's nothing here that's
gonna get particularly hot anyway so
that's why asus is able to take a little
bit more liberty with their design
choices and make it sort of look cool up
at the top of the board will find our 8
pin sepia CPU power connector right
where it belongs I've actually had quite
a few people ask me about this little
this little 4 pin cover here the 4 pin
cover is so that if you're using a power
supply that only has a 4 pin connector
you can plug it in to just these four
and the board will still function so if
you have an 8 pin power connector on
your power supply you should remove this
tab plug in all eight pins in the middle
of the board we will find an am-3 socket
right where it belongs we've got support
for all of AMD's ddr3 CPUs so like I
said before X 3 X 2 X 4 X 6 is X
whatever you want next we have support
for dual channel ddr3 and Zeus is also
using their somewhat unique Ram slots so
the one side doesn't actually move back
you just unclip one side slide the
module in to the one side put it down
the rest of the way and then clip it in
so you only have to use one next we've
got our 24 pin connector along the side
here right where it belongs and then
right next to that we've got probit so
these aren't adrene out points ground
looks like North Bridge South Bridge
hypertransport North Bridge VDD nb1
hmm okay I'm not sure Ram CPU PLL CPU
and then another ground point so that's
that's a pretty cool feature you can
check all your voltages with a
multimeter rather than relying on
unreliable BIOS level monitoring ok so
moving down we have oh this is kind of
something that we should talk about we
have 6 SATA 6 gigabits per second ports
right there so those are all running off
of the AMD chipset rather than using a
third-party chipset so that's one of the
unique things about the brand-new 800
series boards and then moving down we've
got the Republican
gamer's branding on our Selfridge
heatsink there and let's keep going down
to the bottom so here's our front panel
connectors and we've got Wow how many
one two you know what I actually can't
tell what all of these are supposed to
be it looks like any number of okay yeah
USB here
USB USB and I don't know what this one
is so there you go
alright here's all of our buttons so
we've got start and reset buttons on
board here's the core on Locker button
and here is the overclock button camera
man's phone is ringing there we go
okay you know what why don't we do
something that I very rarely do on this
show I'm actually going to consult the
manual about something yep right here on
camera I'm gonna attempt to find out
what's something that I don't know what
it does does oh whoa we're coming up on
ten minutes never mind I am NOT going to
do that unless I can find it really
quickly forget it okay so let's move
around to the PCI Express slots we have
one two three four PCIe 16x slots two
PCIe our PCIe PCI slots and it actually
says what these run at so this one runs
at four X this one runs at either 16x or
eight X this one runs at either eight X
or 1x and this one runs at 16x
regardless so let's go around to the
back we could have a look at what
connectivity we have here we've got one
ps2 keyboard port we have six USB 2.0
ports we have I see most clear button
two USB 3.0 ports then we have optical
audio out firewire eSATA the Republic of
gamers link and onboard 7.1 audio those
look gold-plated - that's pretty nice
for onboard audio thank you for checking
out my unboxing of the crosshair for
formula motherboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
