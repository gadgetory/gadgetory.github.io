recording the first time with the new
GoPro Hero 5 session the first test I
did yesterday were pretty disappointing
as every video i recorded head 20 bytes
so they were all completely empty also
there seems to be some stability issue
with remote controlling it there is also
some delay i don't have with the sony
usually and I'm of course missing the
nice small remote control from the sony
so i'm using the ipad mini now yeah but
today is clock radio time I got two
devices from china from company culture
x this one goes for thirty-three dollars
i think and this one for 39 or 40
dollars but you can have them for
cheaper with my promo code which is
included within the comment section yeah
let's turn both on they functionality
wise they are both pretty similar just
that this one has the drivers at the
front and this has drivers to the sides
there is also a pc free data included in
both and yeah you can see it has both
have charging out microsd playback they
both have FM radio auxiliary in and of
course some clock radio which you can
see here we can switch between different
modes this is the date we have today so
its 11th of October there is an alarm
included this is the SD card playback
line in radio which yeah reception is
pretty bad but yeah they sound pretty
nice for clock radios I mean also
regarding the price I mean it's not a
small device but I think it sounds
really nice and before having a listen I
would like to share some frequency
response measurements with you so this
one is from the big device and the other
one is from the smaller one but measured
on X is so I really had to do in the
microphone like that because of X is
measured from front you'll lose quite a
bit of travel definition and it starts
sounding a bit yeah harsh let's say so
you get a curve like that without lots
of
well of course as you can see both
already role of around 200 Hertz so
there is some bass but only noticeable
at higher levels at low levels they both
could get along with some loudness or
some dynamic bass adjustment but at
higher levels you can see there is still
some response down to around 75 hurts so
they both sound really nice when cranked
up let's switch to bluetooth on this one
as well and here we can do some
switching with some songs yeah I'm
connected to well to both know and a lot
let me see yeah and let's start with the
bigger one and the kind of smooth a song
for waking up or something and because
the drivers are slightly apart you get a
nice stereo separation with this one
sorry for the background noise but I
have two rabbits doing some noise so not
a smaller one and you can hear that the
sound is a little bit diffused because
of the drivers which aim outwards
the people in your post one this sounds
better and is also cheaper maybe some
kind of lounge track
it also has some stereo separation but
the sound is simply emitted outwards so
you don't get this direct sound of the
bigger model I think this one sounds
very decent of course at lower levels it
tends to sound tinny but yeah let's try
that trick some punk maybe you can hear
that is really some nice turn off the
small one again maybe it's increased
volumes like but the bigger one
definitely sounds Coco another track
some house and maybe you can hear that
there is some nice space response
overall yes not very loud it would have
needed to be pushed slightly for low
levels
this is the smaller one mo it doesn't
have this nice base it's also smaller
but we could of course try maybe
comparing them with the anchor sound
coil which costs I will turn it off
which caused yeah I think forty dollars
it's of course much smaller but just for
stationary unit at home I think this is
much better for the same price or even
less yeah let's see if I'm connected i
am and i will crank this one to maximum
here so we can really control the entire
volume range and let's start again with
the same track i will stand up with my
remote control so that I see if I'm
really filming the right part and yeah
let's increase volume then Cano and you
can hear that it sounds much more any
Lex Lex again or extracts I don't know
how
there are tracks make some noise they
have to reduce volume two matches that
favor of the maximum
this one definitely sounds fuller so if
you like them yeah get the promo code
and you will get thirty percent of until
furtive of October the code is in the
description I think both are pretty nice
although I definitely prefer the bigger
one although the the smaller one has a
nice display here we can try turning it
on again so yeah as you can hear i'm
becoming sick again yeah i think it's
nice but you will have to keep it
attached to my cruise before charging
all the time i'm not sure how long it
really lasts with the with the clock
radio on like that so thanks to X Rex or
and no cracks or acts xrx really don't
know how to pronounce it you could see
functionality wise really a lot included
including yeah you can leave your phone
attached for charging yeah auxiliary
microsd playback pretty nice let's try
the radio here as I think I I this is
the date again and I think there is some
station line cause it will be what would
happen eyes yeah so it works yeah if you
like them go for them again the promo
codes are within the description you
will get thirty percent off for both so
I think this you could get this one for
way below thirty dollars I think it's
pretty nice thanks a lot for watching
and see you in the next video have a
nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
