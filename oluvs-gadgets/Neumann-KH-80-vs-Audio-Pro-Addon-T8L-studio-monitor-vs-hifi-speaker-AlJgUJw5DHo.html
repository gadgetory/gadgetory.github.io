the environment cage 80 against the
audio pro tal I know it's a little bit
unfair also doesn't make that much sense
because this is a professional studio
monitor by this cheap small hi-fi system
for home from average user still I think
all your process sounds really great so
they can compete to some degree within
moments although they are not meant for
monitoring so not for this precision
rather pvo and a pleasant nice sound you
can of course also check them out
through my database also listen to the 9
months how loud they can play a pod is
not as a diamond box 1m with less
distortion although you can hear some
odd noise the audio Pro cannot compete
here but from normal levels I think they
do a really great job but instead of
using my usual artificial head I will
use my own head I will sit down at the
sofa and we can have a listen I hope
everyone is wearing headphones if not
please put them up now and I also hope
my neighbor who is currently mowing the
garden won't disturb us that much maybe
you can hear him in the background yeah
but we'll play the speakers at a higher
level anyhow to make them more
comparable I had to increase based on
the audio problem notice and decrease
relevant not and I will start with a
remix from savasana in the normal spring
first
your Gibran
I myself am more precise this appears a
bit washed out maybe also broader so the
staging is not as precise
much better and from Center
is it more natural but the difference is
not huge
perfect something from Poland
I brought some of your older as if there
was some staring hansung algorithm
we should maybe here at the base of the
audio reaches deeper but the moments are
faster more punchy something else
yeah they miss summer punch maybe there
is already some compression included
come on work baby like the food plate
today I'm doing so I don't care what you
say I'm chilling up in the sky the
current versus letting off the hurtles
where been employed on purchasing card
opportunity with the forest of the beat
and it's completed my food never
depleted by me on the beach is already
pushed me too much from southern
princess region yet they don't manage
this launch this kick
it's not way more precise I think you
could hear the audio Pro sundry great
not to such a degree as an annoyance but
for a small high system for this price
they do a great job yeah I hope you
liked this little comparison I like them
a lot I also like the anointment but I
have to send them back to my friend so
max thanks for lending me them I did
some nice videos also included them into
my database without you I couldn't have
managed I hope you like this as well of
course many more comparisons like this
are coming I will get some other studio
monitors maybe I'm making something from
no belt
newb new bird it's a German company they
really make great speakers so I will get
something from them until then stay
tuned have a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
