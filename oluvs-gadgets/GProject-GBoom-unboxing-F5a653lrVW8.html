this is the G boom from G project that
just arrived today this because only
available in America and it costs around
$96 so it might be a bargain for what
you get as you can see it says here big
bass play loud built off speaker of the
year by I lounge I'm not sure what to
expect from this but maybe it's really
decent so let's open the box my son will
help me a little bit so what we have
inside you this is the power supply
obviously let's see if it works also for
input yeah 400 until 240 volts so we can
use it also here in Europe and this is
the Boombah Boombah Boombah yeah this is
a big boom box so let's check it out
the second in the second yeah yeah looks
like some toolbox for work or like some
some yeah radio or something let's drive
it will turn on yeah it turns on so you
can try pairing immediately by the way
I'm using my binaural microphones so
yeah you should hear what I'm hearing we
will try it out see boom well I'm a bit
skeptical about a speaker with boom in
it you know mini boom mega boom boom and
so on and everything you get is some
fart but maybe this one is better let's
see if it capital subject mask and
cannot see let's see how this one sounds
okay volume is not in sync between
player and this seems to be maximal they
speak up and we have some EQ button here
well very much of a difference
well I'm not impressed
totally which one is the bass heavy
setting maybe this one ah yeah let's
pull it against the FIFA Helsinki uses a
bit smaller also much lighter but also a
bit designed like some back or hand back
and let's crank both to maximum
this is still the G boom maximum volume
now let's try the FIFA
yeah it's what horrible but you know we
want to hear some boom so let's try
something really booming oh this was it
the batteries got lost
let's try the FIFA okay I think this is
enough for the first impression well I'm
not that impressed but maybe $400 not
bad
we will of course do add more detailed
sound check the RT husky shot is whether
a Coulier we will do of course a more
detailed sound check but I don't think
it's really it can compete with the you
know with our usual candidates like for
Excel or JBL extreme it doesn't even
reach the same Ladin yeah miss malotte I
was all denim and range tech a sister I
miss my Aston adopt a coffin yeah so
yeah this was just a very first unboxing
and first impression stay tuned for a
more detailed comparison but it's
already said I'm not sure what's this we
yeah I'm not sure it's really worth it
four hundred dollars maybe but it
doesn't seem dead loud Dada yeah yeah
so obviously my son likes it so he will
probably keep it
thanks guys for watching and see you
then bye bye
Dushan ring that so camera tap-in papa
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
