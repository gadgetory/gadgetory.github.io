give you some more details about the
base Puma or base Puma or BP one so it
calls itself we've already heard it in
unboxing and also in some other videos
to tell you it left me quite impressed
especially for around hundred dollars it
definitely belongs to the better
products because out there currently
it's not available on Amazon I think
it's backordered but there is another
speaker shark wave which costs also the
same and I found another company thanks
to some YouTube viewer and they sell
exactly the same speaker which looks
just the same like the base Puma the
shockwave looks a bit different but all
of them come with an optional charging
cradle so for charging you simply put
the speaker here and don't need to
attach any wires of course I cannot say
anything about the shockwave if they
really sound the same but a friend of
mine tested the shockwave and he
complained about lots of problems at low
levels he heard some artifacts at levels
above half he complained about
Distortion well the bass Puma doesn't do
this the only problem the bass Puma has
is maybe some higher amount of noise
floor so there is some hiss at low
levels it definitely sounds great at low
levels but if you are sensitive to noise
and hiss you probably won't like the
bass Puma that much the shockwave does
the same from what I heard but before
having listened I thought we would like
to check out some frequency response
measurements and here you can see some
at different loudness levels I would say
that the general tuning is rather flat
and natural with some bass and treble
boost at the same time so a kind of
smiley responds this way the sound
remains more in balance than on some
other speakers which just tend to post
bass but keep the trailer recessed you
can also see some dynamic bass
adjustment at low levels which of course
gets reduced at higher levels and a high
amount of bass is visible at around 200
Hertz this becomes a peak at higher
levels and makes the speaker maybe
appear a bit balmy or boxy
will maybe try correcting this with some
EQ later on but first maybe let's have a
listen how it sounds as always i'm using
binaural microphones so you should
listen headphones for the best results i
will turn it on so you can hear the
welcome tones which are not too loud
just the voice prompt
connected yet can become a little bit
annoying and currently I don't have any
other comparable speaker just this
anchor premium which is a bit cheaper
but a very popular model so we can
compare how these two sound what I like
so much about the base Puma that the
sound remains pretty controlled there is
not any kind of dynamic compression just
at higher levels it starts to distort a
little bit but still it's much more
control than for example a gem heavy
metal or a bit Singh Royale or something
also more controlled than the anchor
especially with very dynamic mixes like
the following example from the 80s they
didn't use lots of compress or limiting
effects during the mastering with such
songs at Bose Soundlink mini for example
struggles completely when I listen to
the song with the Bose something meaning
I thought it was broken so let's listen
I will start with the bass puma and then
later on we switched to the Anchor Bay
screamer you can hear maybe around our
sound and fuller song the anchors sounds
a little bit strange although it does
you distorted the Bose would make this
bulb
let's try the next track and it will
become more visible for here above the
base from this went up pretty well here
with the base simmer while the Ankara
here cannot quite play it well let's see
how far we can increase the volume
I will also increase it in the face
cream
now it starts to distort as well but we
are already playing at a much higher
level
let's try media another trick we have an
croissants cleaner
so maybe let's compare that bass Puma or
bass Puma I still don't know how to
pronounce it correctly against a very
popular and great JBL charge 3 yeah this
is a bit more expensive
I think hundred $50 or 170 euros the
charge 3 is a great bass performer but
has some other problems as well here I
will try to match them again and I will
start with the base
you can hear some boom eNOS from the
base I will start an equalizer app this
app is called EQ 10 I will darken the
image slightly so you can see it better
and yeah where is where is my cue let's
pray let's play some track this is
already with equalizer
without
and looking at a curve you can maybe see
that I reduce 200 Hertz yes nearly
completely which of course makes the
sound a bit more more - like let's say
so this is with equalizer now as this
will out we had as you hear this room I
think I have some stir enhancing yeah I
have some care enhancing and a love as
well again without sometimes the switch
doesn't work no I will increase volume
slightly the base becomes a bit better
defined but let's continue comparing
both by bass human charge 3 with some
kind of maybe rock track and have a
listen how the charge 3 becomes a bit
mushy yeah I'm starting out with the
base Puma
you can maybe also hear some first hints
of intermodulation yet another problem
of the charge three let's try another
Freck again with the base primer first I
will reduce volume slightly here the
paste for deafness on boomers the track
3 has deeper base but it strives a bit
with clarity for outdoors the tuning of
the bass tone is more favorable because
of this strong and only bass
three
I will put them a bit far away so we can
maybe turn it even louder with some kind
of dance track you can hear that it
remains really punchy with no
compression no swallowing of sheeps and
so on the trash shrimp
I suppose this nice bass from tip but
it's missing somehow the clarity of the
face image
watch him
I would increase water
finally
the face - my slow
not a trick
trash free
and you can maybe hear this coarseness
with the cherry which is yeah
intermodulation and you can also hear
that the bass drum is still rendered
well the bass Puma why the JBL starts to
swallow this speak
but based on his method disappearing
here
it becomes really mushy a sausage of
sound another track and let's listen
that is indeed maximum volume the
compressor limiter and everything starts
cool another track and you can hear that
the punch is still there just no real
lower face
so yeah it's not the perfect speaker but
I mean it's definitely one of the better
ones for around hundred dollars maybe
because I mentioned the hiss maybe we
can manage to well to reproduce it at a
very very low level it goes away I mean
you can hear it there is a basic noise
floor but there is some noise gate which
cuts it off when there is no music
playing and but from a meter away you
probably won't hear it anyhow
still I know there are many very
sensitive people who don't like noise
they already complain about the pendant
off simply play one which definitely is
not as noisy what I didn't show you yeah
there is some light so you can see when
I come closer there is some proximity
sensor obviously of course it has to be
tagged to be seen but we have this is of
course a nice touch so you really you
can also adjust volume in darkness and
so on yeah what else to say it needs a
property charger this is maybe a no-go
for many it cannot be charged through
microUSB it has a charging out the
battery in my case lasted for three
hours at maximum but you could hear that
it's already quite a bit louder than the
JB HR 3 but the JB a chattery at maximum
lasts around 6 hours or even more so if
you need a decent speaker for around
Halle Dallas yeah and don't mind the
slightly higher noise floor and also
maybe a little bit boo - but this can be
easily corrected with some equalizer
just take some notch filter and yeah cut
away 200 Hertz and it becomes better
every boost above 100 Hertz is not that
mm yeah it's not that great I'm not sure
why many companies still boost base at
200 250 Hertz the
sounds horrible like Ultimate Ears does
have a huge boost at 200 Hertz and below
nothing the bass Pima definitely sounds
better than their mega boom nearly as
loud although there is some distortion
you could hear at very high levels it
has it keeps this dynamic so with a
house track you get pom pom pom and with
the mega boom you get to get nothing so
yeah it's a great speaker and I'm really
impressed from my wife it has too much
bass she doesn't like it that much but
yeah for every bass lover it doesn't
have the deepest bass you could hear
that charge-free reached deeper but
started to well to add intermodulation
distortion the treble become became a
bit yeah sizzling the bass boomer sounds
pretty well it's really nicely tuned I
prefer it much more than a bose
soundlink mini or even that both
something three the swipes the flow with
that sounding three with much better
sound much better dynamics also louder
than the Bose with the boss starts to
compress around 70% so yeah it's a great
speaker maybe not perfect but yeah we
can see what's possible it's at the
price of $100 both ask 300 for their
sounding three and gives you worst
results so I hope this was helpful I
tried covering all aspects about the
bass boomer yeah the charging cradle is
really really nice just put it there
this costs extra I think $20 or
something I'm really not sure about the
shock wave
if this sounds the same or if they have
corrected all the issues I'm not sure
the bass pyramid the only the only issue
I have is maybe some high amount of his
for very low level listening this might
may become annoying and the base could
be tuned less booming with less boost at
200 Hertz this would definitely improve
the sound even more so yeah turning it
off will do some other tone I think this
is the same tone you get from the pure
excel which of course is not among us so
yeah it's that some maybe still own it
but that pill Excel doesn't exist
anymore I definitely prefer these stones
over over this loud checkup boom
so yeah I think I covered everything I
will of course use the base Puma for any
future videos as reference as $400 I
mean you have to like this smiley
response this stronger bass and treble
boost I think it sounds okay I mean it
makes the bass Bhima really sound big
and exciting unlike many other flats
because which is the sound flat so for
low levels I prefer that bass boom over
the Helsinki that you can see there yeah
and it also sounds great at high levels
you just have to know where the limits
are not to crank it to loud if you if
the distortion starts creeping in there
for ya thanks a lot for watching and
yeah see you in the next video have a
nice time end</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
