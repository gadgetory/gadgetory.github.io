asked by many to review some wireless
headphones wireless in ears instead of
those white ones which are old-school
nobody uses them anymore many
smartphones don't even have a headphone
out now so I'm getting comments yet
review some two hours in ears because
this is the future the problem is that
it's so hard to find a decent sounding
normal in here a wired one so let alone
a wireless one so companies have to
learn how to tune an inny correctly and
then we will talk about wireless and to
demonstrate to this problematics yeah
here I have three units rather low
budget so around $60 I think for the tws
x9 this is from Crohn's Baptist punky
Bud's funky spunky but and I have one
from private the x1 and before talking
about sound let's look inside all what
is the same so come with some charging
box the p w x9 slides out so if you put
them inside it will become immediately
charged you have to you need some sticky
fingers to get them out because they are
magnet magnetic some of them immediately
turn on if you take them out this not so
you have to keep or press yeah then they
will turn on connect to each other
connect your phone and you can listen
the spunky buds
I'm always the same box easily be
different more futuristic here's a
button so you open it this louder slide
out but these are really huge so you
have them like this and immediately now
when I put it inside I get again some
some driver flex and really loud one I
mean most of them have this problem
especially those cheap earbuds that when
you put them inside because of the air
pressure you hear some crackling but
this is result so when I when I try to
get some seal it's it hurts inside you
because the the crackling is so loud so
those are touch sensitive so you can
stop music maybe even mood by dialed
epping switch the next track it tells
you that they are connected left-right
and so on
the problem is that sometimes you just
touch them and music stops or I know
you'll you touch your hairs the tribe it
on the other hand has no touch controls
you see I put them inside and they're
immediately charged here is also a
battery indicator which shows you how
much battery is left inside this
charging box the tribe it has no touch
controls but as you can see it's the
smallest box out of these really
comfortable and the in ears are also
quite small so this is left this is
right they disappear inside your ear
also hardly noticeable that you wear
them because they are so light much
lighter than these and they have also a
control button the problem may be touch
sensitive controls are better in this
for this purpose because here you have
to press it and then you again cause
some pressure on your ear which can
become a bit uncomfortable or you also
get crackling this also suffers from
some slight rhinoflex but it's not the
head not it not that extreme so there is
no charging indicator you simply put it
in you can hear they snap in
magnetically you can see that they are
charged but there is no status you don't
know how much battery or charge is left
in this box still if you look at the
size this is definitely the easiest one
to carry around it's half the size of
this thing or so way smaller than this
so we're simply putting into the pocket
there private definitely does the best
job so but now how do they sound and I
won't talk anything I will simply let
you listen and afterwards we can maybe
discuss this so first I will start with
this tws x9 then let's switch over to
the transmat spunky parts and at the end
the x1 and the fourth part fourth part
will be the original track so you get an
idea how how it should sound in reality
I will play three tracks so you get
maybe a better idea and I will put them
inside here so let's have a listen
easy to eat my baby inside my fantasy
come to me you are in my thoughts I
never stray from the heart of you
we can't
yeah they really sound like this more or
less so now you know what I'm talking
about
this is unusable horrible unbelievable
especially when looking at all those
great reviews the only ones that were
quite decent other tribe 8x1 yeah not
affiliated with them in any way I was
not involved in the tuning I just asked
for a review sample and I was surprised
that they sound so much better than the
other so let's put them away this is
just junk
I really I don't know how people can
even give three stars for this because
it's really horrible
there is a catch though so with the
original included tips which looked like
this
so these are some to flinch tips first
of all they are too small so for normal
year you will hardly get any good seal
and these tips compromise the sound too
much so I found this here which are from
the mx-5 that I reviewed some time ago
you can see the alejandra so they fit
better into my ear also fit nicely on
the injury itself they stay quite okay
inside the year and the sound opens up
way more so with the with the original
tips it's a bit muffled the treble
doesn't sound right the resonance
frequency is shifted rather lower but if
the tip has a big opening like this it
sounds really nice also found other ones
which are not double flange so the sound
is small is the same with this here but
it would here it's a little bit bass
heavy so when I put up this here I don't
get a perfect seal so this reduces based
slightly so it's better for a critical
listening also you could maybe hear
treble appears slightly grainy so it's
not as refined as a high-end in here but
still really really nice and I enjoyed
them a lot I use them as my on the go in
here Wireless one just put them inside
this box they fit into any pocket
battery life is great I haven't tested
it until they were completely discharged
but you also see on your phone display
how much charge is left I think you'll
get around one and a half two hours then
you put them inside the box and they
will become recharged again
yeah just keep in mind to try out other
tips I would definitely recommend them
and they are not perfect but I compared
them back and forth with them from the
anchor the one how is it called
and these are definitely better they
sound really like a traditional in here
with just some slight graininess missing
this least amount of refinement but
looking at some measurements if first
let's look at the junky one so the x9
here in blue and see it measures like no
any other in here I've ever seen with
lots of upper base in the three four
hundred region also having any upper
mids I will overlay the Spanky bus in
green here you can see lots of bass
boost really heavily bass boosted also
some peak at four point five kilo Hertz
with again some credit peak at around 11
12 kilo Hertz so overlaying the travitt
x1 this measures like a normal linear
also a bit too much bass but I think
this is quite okay when you are outside
with lots of ambient noise so you need a
bit more bass for the sound to come
through so I will
I really recommend them highly for $39 I
think definitely the best I've heard so
far in this price range but I'm really
hesitating of trying out other ones
because you could hear I think an
average in here sounds like these spanky
parts or even worse like this x9 here
which is I was shocked how bad these are
but most of the others are like this I
have also some not true wireless ones
but once with wire in between the same
junk so companies should learn how to
tune an in-ear correctly
obviously Travis knows something about
it or the engineers which are behind
this they know how an in-ear should
sound because it sounds really great
just yeah with the tips there is some
problem also when I use this here which
are larger which fit better into my ear
when I put it back into the box the box
is designed for smaller tips so when I
put it back and take it out again the
tip often get stuck in
so you cannot take it out you need some
wire or some some I don't know some
needle so it was not designed to be used
with bigger tips but the technicians way
way better so I'm really enjoying it a
lot and I would recommend it highly
if you find the right tips because with
the original one I was also of that
satisfied so these ones definitely
benefit a lot like many in years so if
you have an in-ear which sounds ok but
there is something missing try other
tips different kinds of tips with bigger
openings longer ones smaller ones and it
could be that suddenly the in it becomes
really great like in this case with the
Travie 2x1 mm yeah I'm enjoying it a lot
really if I don't want to anyway I had
one I simply use this also because they
are so small and the sound is really
nice
so I hope I could clear up some
confusion about Wireless in years
whereas headphones there are no violet
from Sennheiser but I know many sin has
a normal in ears which sound already
crappy that cost eight hundred nine
hundred dollars so why should they sound
like him cheap in here for eighteen
ninety dollars correctly no therefore
it's really it's a hard task to find a
good sounding in here although many are
satisfied with their I base all with a
with their file in ears which sound all
crappy you don't believe them they sound
creepy well in this case the traveied x1
with the correct tip sounds really great
and yeah if a company sends me things
there's sound great
please send me one I would like to
review it but so far I'm really shocked
how bad all these are and I'm shocked
how many people still manage to listen
with these and and give them a high
rating yeah all people they have around
I'm not sure so yeah I recommend it just
use different tips these are from the
ultimate ears triple 510
the smallest one the bigger ones I get a
petrified so also more base but with
yeast it's quite okay I just have to get
sure to have them the same way for the
left and right here otherwise yeah they
will become more bass heavy on one side
but because they seal is not that great
they still they hold nicely inside
because they are so small and light so
yeah thanks all for watching this is my
take on wireless in years
it just impossible or close to
impossible to find something really
decent and therefore I'm quite surprised
how great this tribe it x1 sounds
compared to all the other junk yeah have
a listen for $40 it will be hard to find
something better but experimentally bit
with tips I think the key to success is
to have one with larger opening I will
put again the original one here the
opening the opening here is simply way
smaller so I think it's that the opening
which affects the sound too much in this
case yeah nothing has to say I hope you
like this a little bit stay away from
all the crap by the decent ones and yeah
have a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
