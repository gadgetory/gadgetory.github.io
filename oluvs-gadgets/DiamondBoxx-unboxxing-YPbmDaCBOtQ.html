really long Odyssey to get the diamond
box model M here maybe or artists on my
first short teaser video yet this was of
course taken afterwards but now before
is the unboxing and I thought it would
also interest you but have a look inside
the box it has just arrived so my son
will help me a little bit with this
unboxing and quite excited because I've
waited for more than one year to get the
speaker I tried contacting Tony from
Diamond book several times yeah for more
than a year when I saw the first videos
from Harvest Moon Tech he is one of the
only ones who really tested the diamond
box model M why the model M it's smaller
than the model l but has nearly we had
the same loudness maybe also sound wise
from what I could hear from his videos
it sounds a little bit better maybe so
it's really portable smaller than the
Iowa XS 9 smaller than many others
because you can see so it's cuz my pc
healthy the shackles are all steam at
the HRT and yeah Tony never responded to
my emails at my voice under smack no
sound as which 1070 which stands for
calculator so the end the end so we
cannot get it out here we'll probably
have to open the box complete so maybe
it's it's stuck inside and something
let's do it the rough all this way so
it's custody shackle Niemann yeah it's
sticking here obviously
it's not still fine so to study vector
shuttle so Tony never responded to my
emails and then I thought hey I have to
try this out many are asking time on box
time unbox time on box but it would cost
a fortune to get it here so I called
them finally I Coco California gave my
phone bill yeah I think it's upside down
very very strange box I called and a
nice lady called I think Ileana answered
and she said well try the info email
again and tell me what's your yeah
what's your plan and so on so I said I
would like to buy it but with the
shipping cost provided at the site $600
shipping costs I thought here I cannot
afford but I would like to make a video
so I'm willing to buy it but maybe you
can help me out with with shipping costs
so they said yeah sure
buy one and we will cover all the
shipping costs including taxes and so on
and then it took another month to arrive
let's pull it out here yeah so here it
finally is it was declared as some
dangerous goods by UPS they didn't want
to ship it I got another tracking number
then again the same error declared a
shipping good and shipping as dangerous
good and then I waited again with it
again called so my phone bill is really
high now I think hundred twenty three
euros because of my phone calls and you
can finally see it so the diamond box
modeling it's not too big actually about
the size of the JBL boom box but
probably way better sounding and yeah to
check it out i thought i will grab again
my head cam also my binaural microphones
and we can have a very first listen so
please put up your headphones and let's
check it out so let's turn it on and see
if i can connect to it you can see some
diamond here which obviously shows the
battery life so
yeah here it is I'm connected and maybe
let's play some first tune nice analog
dial yes sounds quite nice more
exaggerated in some way many set then
it's a little treble heavy I mean there
is some emphasis on treble obviously but
not as Extreme as I have yes I was
afraid
sounds really decent the only one I have
here which is a little bit compared is
the firebomb stir the new ones it's
cheaper so 300 euros this is depends
which path will you take 500 40 or 50 so
let's try that boom stir yeah not a song
MIDI so this is the monster I have set
the base to 40 beams to make them a
little bit fuller a diamond box that's
definitely more neutral let's say
this has some emphasis on place here we
have boosted it by 4 dB the diamond is
not a boom box rather high price pika
what we could do is of course test it at
higher level so I will use volume here
volume succumb it's a very sweetly cloud
as after snake I searched and let's
increase volume added bit the boom story
is already set for maximum so this is
around 2/3 for the diamond box
- minister
it has no chance against atomic from be
the moon we see Ross
some white horse with maximum
six of eight
we have diamond box is real of course we
will have to test it more in detail but
it's quite impressive yeah so stay tuned
for a more detailed review also for I
will pull it into my database of course
let's put it down also a real weapon I
think around 5 kilograms so the weight
of the of the JBL boombox of course this
is a little bit heavier because of the
huge battery so this is a 231 watt hours
I think this is 70 something amp hours
so let's turn it off I hope you like
this a little bit and yes stay tuned for
more videos let's see what just maybe
the manual or that thank you
blah blah blah blah yeah thanks to Tony
for covering the shipping cost for this
I think it was really worth it for
anyone who Alexander pity pin not emery
a denier he no hammer hidden for anyone
who's looking for a real loud great
sounding speaker with great battery life
and still sounding great I mean the
Xavier boombox doesn't cut it it's
hardly louder than the Toy Fair while
this you could hear it's twice as loud
so I think it's more comparable to the
title boomstick cell will of course also
do this comparison but the woofers are
really nice some high quality woofers
here not some cheap yeah drunk also
Twitter's nice of course I would have
liked some maybe maybe attachable woofer
cover I don't know something with
magnets that you can put here for
transport otherwise really really great
so thanks a lot for watching and see you
in the next video with the diamond box
and and so on and so on
have a nice time and bye bye can start
bye bye son come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
