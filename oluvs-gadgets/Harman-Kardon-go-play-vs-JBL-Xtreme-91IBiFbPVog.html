the new Harman Kardon go in play against
the JBL extreme lazy there was some
confusion about the price of the go in
play as originally it was announced with
$2.99 but suddenly the appeared on the
Harman Kardon us set with $4.99 but when
looking at the Austrian Harman Kardon
side it still says $2.99 and it should
be available with 18th of May so both
are pretty comparable as the original
price for the JBL extreme was also $2.99
meanwhile it dropped quite a bit but who
knows if in some months the Harman
Kardon won't drop as well and you can
maybe get it for cheaper
I thought we listen to some songs as
always I'm using high quality binaural
microphones so you should listen at
headphones unfortunately switching
between one and the other takes a bit of
time so sorry for that but the first
song i will be playing contains some
nice bass notes deep bass notes so we
can hear if both speakers render them
correctly I will start with the go and
play first
there are four different bass notes you
should be hearing
the trivial extreme
yet the first two notes are missing I
will start from the beginning again
the Quint play again
so yeah it indeed plays all four notes
with the G bit extreme you won't get
much below 70 Hertz let's have a listen
if other songs can reveal this
difference as well Jabil extreme you
definitely get much more punch out of
that go and play you could hear the bass
drum pumping let's listen to another
track also nice pounding bass drum here
the G bit extreme
yeah this is quite a difference not even
comparable this to another song
yet the JBL extreme despite having
Twitter's just like the current play
appears a bit coward especially if not
listened exactly on exist let's listen
to another track also very deep bass
notes with this software Felicia track
the G bit extreme
is it just here doesn't sound that great
this is this difference is really light
and made another trick some more
acoustic stuff but also some nice deep
upright bass here the JBL you can
already hear the bass distort we are at
well slightly above our volume so this
is exactly the area where a GPL extreme
starts distorting a bit it becomes
better at higher levels
click on play again hear the sounds as
if you are listening to the band in
front of you also much more spacious
sound let's listen to this the bass drum
is really nicely pounding here lots of
punch thick string
you're not really that much punch I will
increase volume slightly the JBL extreme
as well
okay but there is no part from the bass
drum listen to this as if you are
listening to some subwoofer okay let's
try this right I will increase volume it
more the J bit extreme
let's fry maximum
the JBL also maximum
yeah I will put them far away and let's
listen to some rock
extreme
yet appear seems like a long memory
doesn't sound that great
jbn again
No
till extreme reduce volume slightly but
it doesn't become really bad much better
also the kitchen really
definitely for this now will your
magenta
big screen
yeah there is already some over
I cannot wreck
big string
yes sounds horrible
quint play again
extreme I think this was one of my last
videos including the JBL extreme as I'm
going to sell it is fascinating how a
bit more weight and size can improve the
sound by so much it's definitely one of
the best sounding portable speakers I've
heard and I already compared it against
their deep blue to the old version the
toefl bumster I will also compare it
against the banal dollars until 8:15 but
I already know that this sounds much
better so if you really want the best
portable speaker and don't mind the
slightly bigger size of the JBL Xtreme
you go for the Harman Kardon go in play
it's simply the best currently there is
no better one I hope this video was
helpful for you I hope this could give
you an idea about these speakers the JBL
has to go as I rather use the JBL charge
3 for portable use this is too large and
for home use and also for around the
house the Harman Kardon wipes the floor
with anything else so thanks a lot for
watching we will see us in the next
video and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
