but I think if I hadn't called again
yesterday at the customs they would have
probably still have kept it for another
week so now it's finally here
I thought we will do some unboxing let's
look inside Wow nice Excel style
oh wow very beautiful let's turn it on
speaker is on pairing mode pairing mode
use the Bluetooth settings on your
device to connect so where is it pairing
successful and let's have a listen
all this nice bass don't know what
everyone is complaining but
I don't know what everyone is
complaining about the base which is
really deep let's try a frequency
generator I am curious
we are at 150 Hertz
eighty
5550 normal load
so the bass response is really
impressive
you hear 50 Hertz I mean the extreme
won't play 50 45 40 to 40 and you still
hear it
whoa okay below 40 it stops let's try it
from here
yeah it's definitely a nice-sounding
unit I'm really not sure what everyone
is complaining about I mean if you hold
it in your hand you can feel the base
and everything I think this is how you
remove the core press or pull I don't
know okay I don't want to damage it
because I mean maybe I should have
looked into there but it's working and I
think it's pretty nice from what I heard
here and now it's a nice device now
coming up next is of course the raffle I
already prepared the fortunes you have
them there are really many and I will
cut them of course like this put them in
some basket or something and my son will
pull them out
I changed the drawing now because first
I thought it would be okay if every
donation would have one fortune but
there were so many people who donated
more than one dollar we have one who
donated fifty another one donated fifty
nine and I think these people should
have a higher chance to win the speaker
there for people with ten dollars have
ten fortunes while people with fifty
have of course fifty I mean this is
simply the the most fair way to to
choose the one so coming up next will be
the raffle we will draw one of the lucky
winners and yeah see you then and bye
bye hey where's my sandwich</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
