they're both blue double diamond bye-bye
variable okay okay this is the sony srs
x-33
and this is the JBL charge 2 plus on
their both blue and the main differences
between both are the JBL charge 2 plus
is water proof or water-resistant and
the sony srs x3 well has L back or a DAC
some kind of well new codec from Sony
that allows for a high resolution Oh
screaming not sure why they didn't went
for a px which is more common so they
went for some own proprietary solution
the JBL tracks 2 plus can also charge
external devices the Sony cannot do this
I don't want to go into technical
details you can read everything on the
internet I just wanted to show you some
differences in sound I'm wearing by
normal microphones and we will have a
listen to some songs and compare both I
will put them up here at the edge to
avoid any reflections with their with
the surface underneath and I would say
that the Sony is quite a decent low
level performer it sounds really good at
low levels therefore we will start with
some jazz song at a lower level and
listen to the Sony first
another jellyfish too
the magic starts if you turn on sound on
the Sony let's have a listen it broadens
up the sound I mean the stereo image
while the JBL charge 2 plus remains a
bit of a mono sound source this is the
piano it's trapped inside the speaker
why with the Sony you hear some with
again the charge to plus
again with its sound this effect is
working pretty well now it didn't work
that well on their oath x3 because it
changed the frequency response it
boosted treble even more although it was
already boosted and it boosted pace as
well but this time sound only changes
really the the stereo image it sounds a
bit similar to what Denon is doing with
the in via Mini but Sony pushes it a bit
further I think because it really makes
the sound extremely broad let's listen
to another song this is an old recording
from the 70s which I ripped from an LP
and typical for the recordings of the
70s was lots of stereo separation so
have a listen to this
I hear the drums somewhere here beyond
the JBL charge two plus and the Fender
Rhodes is playing somewhere here and now
let's listen to the JBL well it's all
trapped inside here I mean
it's quite impressive you really get an
huge soundfield again without sin
without son
it's still growth but will sound you get
much more with
Genesis 2 plus yeah
I think the problem start with the Sony
if you increase loudness a little bit
let's hear another trick and I'll turn
it up slightly and it starts losing
dynamics let's listen to the jagged edge
tool plus you can hear the punch the
punch of the bass drum while with the
solo the bass drum is not there anymore
still the JBL is a mono speaker while
the Sony gives you this to speak I can
even move your head around and it still
stays
but some songs can cause really problems
with the Sony let's listen to this
listen to the bass it's distorting at
the Trib you have so much more fun shake
the song again the basis
scratching needs a new we are far from
full volume that's maybe three thirds
but
it's not clean anymore against honey
yeah that bass started to disappear I
mean the x-33
ree retains more bass than the x3 but I
have never heard such a strong dynamic
compression
let's turn both to the maximum now and
let's have a listen how different they
managed to sound I'm starting again with
the Sony and listen to the well dynamics
it's it's completely missing from the
Sony
the Junior School
I think the the difference is pretty
obvious
well the Sony is more of a low-level
performer it sounds better I would say
then the jab you touch to Plus also then
the demo in by a mini but if you
increase volume beyond half you will be
getting distortion well lots of dynamic
compression I've never heard a speaker
with more dynamic compression than the
sony srs x3 it's really struggling at
higher levels it's a nice speaker I mean
but the battery life is not that great
you get at maximum volume I got one hour
and a half then it automatically reduced
volume and continue to play for maybe
two and a half hours while the JBL
charge 2 plus can be cranked at maximum
for about six maybe even seven hours
without reducing volume or anything else
yeah if you need some nice background
music with pretty impressive stereo
image well go for the Sony but if you
need punchy sound mono sound I would go
for the JBL charge too I hope this
helped a little bit I will of course add
both my interactive audio speaker
database in in fact I already added I've
still not completely finished therefore
stay tuned for maybe be patient for two
three weeks and it will be pulled online
thanks for watching and see you in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
