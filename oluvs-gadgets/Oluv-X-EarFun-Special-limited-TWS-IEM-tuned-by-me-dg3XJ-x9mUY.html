have noticed I was quite busy and also a
little bit sick and today I would like
to show you one or the outcome of this
let's call it busyness a limited edition
of a true Wireless Indian tuned by
myself well first the whole story behind
it this is the earphone free Irfan is a
new company consisting of some extra bit
engineers that don't work for tribute
anymore but I know them from early on as
I helped to tune some of their speakers
and that Irfan free will be their first
product it's already launched on
IndieGoGo with an early bird price of
$39 so they send it to me earlier a
prototype with two different versions
bigger and the smaller driver they
wanted some feedback from me so I had a
listen and I thought that the small
address on it better it would still need
some additional tuning but it was quite
ok a little bit bass heavy also on maybe
a little bit too much trouble and I told
them I could yeah I could help to tune
if maybe I could send you some
suggestions some accuse and so on and
then I had the people listen for the
bigger driver version you can see they
look the same just that the trailer is
different they also sound different that
typical through wireless earbuds with an
charging box charging is done by USB see
which is of course quite nice great
battery life completely waterproof or
sweat proof from Wally fred and after
listening analysing it a little bit
further I thought that the bigger driver
had more potential without any Peaks a
smooth response just not really tuned
well so the passive tuning the road
running is not that great from the
bigger driver but I thought if tuned
well this could be brought to a really
high level so ask them should I try and
yeah try your luck
but we already launched this version
here it's already in production what we
can a proposal we can make a limited
edition with your own tuning so I
thought what a great idea
an own India tuned by me why not and
this is what I would like to present you
now
the limited edition is different it's a
different hardware with a different
driver and with my own personal tuning
yeah I try to make it sound appealing
also quite natural I'm not quite sure
how the regular version sounds because
yeah I didn't follow it sounds
definitely different than the one I have
here it's not bad but I tried to really
make it a high end but to a high level
that I personally would be also
satisfied so not to a frequency response
that is not off in any way without any
ugly Peaks like we had from the panel
Dobson do play eight or many others and
him maybe this is the first through
Alice in here that I would like to get
that I would like to listen by myself I
already promoted but I presented the
tribute x1 I think this one sounds way
better I'm not sure if I should because
I haven't heard the final version they
just told me that my EQ settings that I
apply externally if imported into the
DSP it sounds the same so I hope that
the final version will sound exactly the
same as the one that I tuned it will be
only available in black and it will it
will be a little bit more expensive I
think instead of 31 $39 $49 it will also
come with a personal card with my
signature tuned by me and so on so I
think this is a really nice product
I really cannot say anything about the
regular one as I don't own the final
version but they are still working on
implementing this and it will be limited
to 100 units only so for all my viewers
who need some nice through Alice in your
below $50 I think I don't want to show
off something but I think it's a really
great if the final version sounds really
like the one that I intended or that I
tuned it's quite comfortable really
light lighter than most others you can
see it stays inside quite well so I can
move my head the only thing there is
some dry no flag so if you put it
you can hear maybe some cracking and if
you create some overpressure it may take
some two seconds for the driver to come
back I criticize this but they said they
cannot change it anymore this is due to
design and the factory cannot change it
anymore
so the limited version will be just 100
units a little bit more expensive but I
think for my viewers who trust my sound
judgment my my my sound whatever yeah I
hope you can get this one and I don't do
this I don't get any money for this just
wanted to tell you this so I don't
promote it because I will become read
from this I didn't get any money the
only thing I will get is some Commission
2% of the sales of this
so if 100 units are sold and we'll get
hundred dollars I mean yeah so this is
I'm not doing this for for money or just
because I wanted a product which I would
be satisfied with and hopefully some of
you as well and they told me if it's if
if it becomes successful so if the
limited edition it sold out quickly they
could maybe if released some fara ones
but for now only hundred units will be
produced and then let's see how
successful it becomes and so on I don't
want to show you the sound now I could
play on some sound samples trust me it's
quite base event MIDI in the stock
tuning so I tried to overcome this I
tried to reduce bass but to such a level
that you still get this lower bass kick
without any boo - at the same time a
nice clear treble and I did want to
throw a to make an extreme adjustments
to the sound just very slight tuning
without reducing any Peaks because there
are no nasty picks here therefore it's
easier to tune and Iniesta if the
frequency response is quite smooth so
this will be the limited edition of the
irfan free check it out on the IndieGoGo
site from Iran
I hope you can get my addition as I
think I cannot couldn't compare them but
I think I really brought it to some high
standard let's say definitely way better
than those overpriced Bo play drunk or
sennheiser momentum or highlights to
violence or whatever this is a really
nice sounding one comparable in sound
maybe to a not as booming as the AKG
Samsung bundle the Samsung AKG bundle or
it sounds rather like maybe something
between the Sony image one and treble is
maybe not s s as smooth or as detailed
but the overall response is quite close
to a Sony image one similar base so it's
not a bass light in here as for outdoors
if you if you walk around with more
Indian noise you definitely need more
bass first I tried to tune it quite flat
with a really mmm
high high fire response but then they
told me customers won't like it because
there is too little bass so I just
reduce the boo - it was way too much
upper base I can show you a measurement
here of the original one so you can see
there is too little response let me
overlay some image 1 as reference just
that you'll see the difference you can
see way too much upper base also treble
is there is too little treble and this
natural peak at 3 kilohertz is missing
from the Radio 1 and this is what I try
to overcome bring it closer to a more
normal response without affecting the
sound too much so I didn't boost by 6 7
DB that maximum boost was I think 3.5 or
40 be with Trevor
apart from that yeah I will of course do
a full review maybe of both but sorry
but I think the limited edition should
definitely appeal to most customers who
who who care about sound who like this
this let's call it natural response not
some
a weird one like from weekend from many
India's so thanks to Irfan for giving me
the chance to shoot my own in-ear and I
hope you will appreciate this as well
check out the IndieGoGo campaign look
for the limited edition it will come
with an own yeah an own card with my
photo so it costs a little bit more and
I hardly get anything from this so 2%
from the sales still I don't do this for
money
I just wanted really to create something
that I would be satisfied with and
hopefully also you and when I get the
final version I will of course do a
review with some sound samples maybe
comparing both the but as for now I hope
this is enough to to draw some attention
from your $49 yeah it's a great price
for it
for this year I think and yeah I hope
you liked this little introduction here
unfortunately I'm still quite busy with
other stuff so not that many videos will
be coming but I will of course try to
continue and let you have to
unfortunately I lost the but this will
be the original packaging maybe a
different color and not quite sure comes
with different tips different sizes the
tips are really nice I mean they don't
and you don't need other tips for a
better sound just use the stock tips and
they already sound really fine as soon
as you take them out of the box they are
already there should be connected to
your phone you can see the charging
status of the the Box the hope you can
see this if you open it you can see for
LEDs light weight and light lighting up
leading up and yeah I think it's really
nice comfortable not too big and from
all those wireless image that I've heard
so far it must be the best one not
because I have to knit but I think it's
really on such a level which I would
definitely yeah be satisfied by myself
tone so it would be only available in
black the limited edition the others are
available in white or in black and here
nothing else to say I
you like this and see you in the next
