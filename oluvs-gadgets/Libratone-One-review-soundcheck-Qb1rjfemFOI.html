deliberate on one Liberatore has just
released two new bluetooth speakers the
one and the two we will cover the two in
an upcoming video and it becomes
available
so first let's have a look at the one
which comes in two different versions
the one click which you can see here and
the one style the only difference is
that the style has already a hammer
built in while the click comes with some
accessories that you can exchange
I already did an unboxing of the speaker
but was not quite sure how to mount them
and in reality it's pretty easy you have
just to remove the frame first and then
you can remove the placeholder so first
let's try maybe mounting the lock it
snaps in then you have to dress up the
speaker again and now you can use the
lock to let the speaker hang somewhere
for example from a rucksack or something
and yeah it also comes with with a
handle that you mount at the sides as
you can see there is no charge included
just a USB wire so the speaker is
charged through microUSB their ports are
behind the flap and auxiliary and the
microUSB port and I really like the
design quite a lot although it stands a
little bit yea wobbly on on an uneven
surface it's pretty hard to to put it
you could maybe put it like there but
these feet or if you mount the
accessories you cannot really put it so
maybe you can also lay it flat as
Liberatore claims it to have or to offer
a 360-degree sound in reality this is a
mono speaker with just one drive at the
front one Twitter and two passive
radiators which aim it to the front and
to the back so when listen to the
speaker from the back you hear one
Twitter and the front driver which emits
forward so it's not really 360-degree
sound but we will check this later on
let's turn it on it also comes
with a nap the liberal tom app which is
also used for the zip speakers and you
can see it already appears here you have
some settings to change it shows you the
input it also comes with an own radio
but this is a radio built-in into the
app so the speaker doesn't have an own
streamer you have battery the batteries
is really great I had it already playing
outside with my son during hiking we had
it mounted on a rucksack and it was
playing closer to maximum as outdoors
you really need these levels and when we
came back after some hours it still shot
more than 80 percent usually there when
we use the view play a 1 it died after
3-4 hours at these levels but this seems
to go pretty strong so let's look into
the settings you can rename it you can
change the color and it also has some
different tunings this is neutral isn't
is listening smooth and soft or
something house rock jazz club but the
settings do not change the sound really
much it sounds pretty cool with neutral
although I would prefer a bit more bass
before having a listen I thought you
might be interested in some frequency
response measurements and you can see
here all available 10 volume steps and
don't be afraid this looks worse than it
sounds
it sounds pretty decent but you can see
some inconsistency with treble I think
this is that whitter the Twitter emits
upwards and it seems to be dispersed by
some acoustic lens forwards and
backwards so you get some slight
resonance some this is typical for some
for the recent liberal tone speakers the
zip and the zip mini also have this
problem but the one sounds better in
this regard so the Twitter or the treble
sounds really nice here better than on
the zip which sounded completely off
also we could have a look at all
measurements of all available sound
tunings and you can see that
there doesn't really change much there
is a bit of a bass boost at house rock
the other ones take away bass or take
away a bit of treble but the difference
is really small so I thought you won't
like to to have a listen I will mount my
head cam now I will put up my binaural
microphone so please put up your
headphones to get really realistic
results and we will have a listen how
this sounds before comparing the liberty
on one against some others because I
would first like to show you some of its
anomalies the fact that it has only one
driver and one Twitter can cause some
problems when music with lots of stereo
separation is playback just like this
very popular example from Pink Floyd so
let's have a listen yeah and you can
hear that half of the coins which are at
the left side appear a little bit
covered it seems as if that whitter was
just playing the right signal we will
test this with a noise generator so
instead of Pink Floyd we will use pink
noise now and both channels are played
now we can hear only the right channel
and now only the left so the Twitter
doesn't play the left channel not sure
if this was intended or if it's some
kind of oversight but songs with lots of
treble at the left side some high heads
or ELMO again both channels the left is
muffled also at the back not that much
comes out and you can also hear how the
treble changes when we move the speaker
around this is probably there is some
acoustic lengths I think with the
Twitter firing upwards and directing the
sound to the front and to the back let's
listen to another song and another
problem you get with the liberal tone
one is especially at low levels listen
how it renders this song at the very
first step
there is some overdrive for fast effect
I will increase volume slightly
and this goes away at a higher levels
but it reminds me a little bit of the
stuff JBL did with the charge to at the
very beginning with old framers let's
listen to not read I will increase
volume it goes away but at very low
levels it sounds a bit strange also that
the volume control is really rough you
get only 10 volume steps we can start
the app which shows much finer stepping
but in reality it isn't so here it
appears and you can see nothing changes
at all
for low-level
listening it's not really great with the
iPhone the volume is in sync but you get
too few steps come over here
hear how the treble changes if we move
to speak around there is nothing some
change but it always remains clear so it
never becomes muffled I was thinking
quite a lot which speaker it reminded me
of and I came up with the JBL pass - I
think this both sounds pretty similar so
let's listen again with the Libra tone
the same song
and I will switch over in the pulse tool
via base is quite similar the overall
fullness of sound
although I prefer the treble of the JBL
to the report parsed Wigan was the
changes if we listen of exes the past
two becomes muffled while this remains
clear even from behind parcel again so
it's not a 360-degree speaker
maybe let's listen cannot rec pass too
also hear of exes or even from behind
the the bottom remains more stable sound
wise so just with one Twitter there they
managed to cover their entire 360-degree
space which is pretty impressive
maybe a better contender would be the
level of Cynthia play one it's a bit
smaller but also more expensive let's
try this one and I will try matching
volume for both the a one is already
connected so let's have a listen again
with the liberal one first
not a one
maybe it's a bit unfair that one speaker
is playing upwards while so we could
also try placing the libera Tom and in
the same way a leprechaun one again
there it should I mean they claim 360
degrees on so it shouldn't lose that
much let's try another track
here but the Ewan's sounds much fuller
on so clearer I will set up the nigga
tonic em up right like that
give up on again yeah it sounds better
but it doesn't have this fullness and
the treble doesn't have the sparkle of
the a1
you can hear much better bass from the
Magnificent let's run our track the
vocals become a bit nozzle as if she was
singing for her nose just like me now my
nose is covered so my voice is a bit
different let's find out a trick
that one of course does best with a
not-so punching music with acoustic
stuff and so on
as soon as you start playing house or
electronica it's trite a little bit we
will hear us later on this is deliberate
on one level I think we're also here
slightly better punch and the trevally
smart sweeter let's listen to this and
you will hear the a wall struggling this
is the bass drum a deliberate on a one
I was increased volume to maximum on day
one maximum
much louder but you can hear that the
liberal phone doesn't reduce base so it
sounds pretty similar when playing at
low levels and that maximum was a low
distortion but that a one is much louder
maybe let's try the JBL charge three
instead the a one is more expensive why
the JBL charge three is cheaper so let's
have a listen how these two compare
again starting with the same track and
Libra tone one first
a charge three yet is a much more punchy
song but this changes of all asshole as
we listen offenses you have to sit
directly in front of the GBA charge
three to get best sound while it's not
it doesn't matter that much with the
Libra tone one let's listen to another
track
but you can hear maybe that it has more
bass also it seems to reach deeper
I will increase voting slightly
and the church really
let's listen for something else
feel the way that I did
here for house and so on I will
definitely take the JBL charge free
although it loses quite a bit when list
of exes
I thought we will put them far away also
closer to the wall this should increase
and we improved bass so I will turn both
to maximum or let's say this is the
Riverton one now at maximum and we will
try matching the charge three now here
we are still around 3/4 maybe the liver
on one display at maximum it remains
pretty punchy not much dynamic
compression and loudness is not really
that high
let's try not write some nice space here
you can hear that give up on wanna lend
us this pretty well never give up on
already appear software while the sharp
street is not really playing at maximum
let's write out a prick I charge free
you can already hear is struggling a bit
with treble I will increase what
information much wealthier nice thing
about the liberal phone is that it
really does not distorted maximum but
it's also not rate allowed to charge me
again
so maybe yeah for dance music and so on
I would probably rather use the charge 3
although it doesn't sound really great
of exes yeah the only thing we could
also try I mean this is really unfair
this is the fee for Helsinki how these
two sound but they FIFA of course costs
twice as much so let's have a listen to
this I will again try matching volume
for both this is fair if I have sync you
know while the rivet on yeah I hope this
is more or less equal volume
I hope you can hear that there are
sounds more growing up
the travel everything is nicer here it
was also only on axis this as soon as I
leave the sweet spot the river phone
remains more consistent chief again
I think the elaborate on one is a pretty
cold speaker although I was torn between
loving it or hating it in the meantime I
just think it's this scent but it didn't
allow me as much as I hoped it would I
love the design
I love the form factor also the
360-degree sound which is not full
360-degree but it works pretty well the
treble is dispersed quite nicely better
than on the comments because like JBL
chapter three and so on so you can
really mount it on a rack second you
will get pretty nice sound even when
hanging on your back
not sure how durable this material here
is it gives a bit of a softer impression
than this used for the JBL extreme or
jbh are three mega boom and so on but
this has to be seen the battery is
pretty solid I haven't tested it for a
long time at maximum but it really seems
to go pretty strong so yeah I hope this
video could give you an an impression
about the liberal turn one we will also
test a Libra tone too soon maybe we can
connect them together for stereo I'm not
sure if this really works so yeah I
would hope a little bit more bass also a
bit more loudness I tried adding base
with an equalizer but this didn't really
work well you I could hear the DSP
working against it so there is really
not much possibility to to add more
punch but it still sounds pretty decent
on a solid level like the we've heard
like the JBL pulse - better than the
flip 3 but it's also a bit larger and
heavier still handable I mean it worked
pretty well when mounted on a rucksack
so yeah it's not too big not too heavy
but I would definitely have preferred a
little bit more more power more punch so
yeah I hope you liked this video and we
will see us in the next one when we
compare it to the limit on two so thanks
a lot for watching and have a nice time
bye-bye

welcome to our review of the new hello
and welcome to a review of the new
straight so let's have a look at the
Libra the one first but first let's have
a look at the one which comes in two
different versions this is style versus
clique
so first let's have a look at the one
which comes in two different versions
this is click and it's also able to sign
the only difference is that clink click
first let's have a look at the one which
comes in two different versions click
which you can see which you can see here
yeah ok no this is click and it's also
well it's also a cache a strike
this is click and it's also a ffffff you
just have to remove this frame here and
then why this is the only difference
style has a kind of a famous azmuth you
get a handle and lock and I already did
an unboxing but I wasn't quite sure this
is not installed in the Sabrina little
SEO surprise I think the design the
design is pretty great from the speaker
I like it quite a lot
who's the auto shop affected Lex or
fascism a vans in this isn't Dragan
Vedanta fascism
huh hello yeah yeah now give us the
funniest answer ristic you have us was
we have to ask each laugh kappa test the
