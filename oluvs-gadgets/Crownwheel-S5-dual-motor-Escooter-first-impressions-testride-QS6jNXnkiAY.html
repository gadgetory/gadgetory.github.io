ago it took nearly two months to arrive
I was already impatiently waiting for
this is this is the new generation as I
do a motor electric scooter from Crone
wheel I did a very quick unboxing today
with my son it doesn't come in any kind
of fancy box it's also preassembled so
you don't need to do anything there
stand here is already mounted you just
need to screw in the grips before doing
so you can also remove a kind of limiter
because the speed is limited at 25 km/h
if you remove this it should be a little
bit faster I think around 30 kilometers
but I think yeah for a legal right you
should keep the limiter inside because
here in Austria is allowed to ride a
scooter like this if it has up to 600
watts of power and if the spin if it's
not faster than 25 kilometers yeah maybe
remember my old scooter this is the old
generation s3 it's from another company
called flj but i think yes they are all
the same a conical chrome wheel they are
the designers of the scooter so they
invented it you can probably get it from
another brand as well but I talked to
chrome wheel and they told me that they
are the original designers of this you
can get it from any Baba right now I
think the price is around 400 dollars
plus shipping and Texas so you will be
around five hundred forty dollars maybe
so not really that expense if you can
already buy it also in Europe but I saw
that the price is much higher
yeah the biggest difference to the old
one I use it nearly every day to arrive
to work I have I let my car in a yeah I
was in Vienna it's everything shot per
me parking so a little bit outside and
then I ride the scooter it's yes because
of the weather it's already very dirty
but the biggest problem of this this it
is simply too weak you can write it well
but it cannot take any steeper ramps any
steeper parts so this is where the s5
should do the trick it has two motors so
on at the back one at the front and you
can switch the real one if needed so
there is switch also much better here is
that you can switch gears directly with
your thumb while here it was not that
easy you what you
you it was much farther away so yeah
it's becoming already quite dark and I
couldn't wait I had to take a first best
ride with it and I thought I would like
to share this with you yeah I will grab
my head cam and let's take some
kilometers or so yeah
try the lightest it's becoming dark
pretty soon now and later on if I still
have some battery left for my camera
I will do my quick resume and later on I
will also maybe when I have written it
more often I will do a full review yeah
but now let's write out I will turn on
the light is it's pretty dark the light
is really bright you can see the rear
light flashes if I break it it becomes
steady so a kind of brake light yeah and
let's start here already the first part
is quite steep I'm with both motors now
so I can climb this easily here and yeah
it's already very fast so I never
managed to climb this part with my old
scooter so it's becoming a little bit
steeper
it becomes slower slower so slows down
but still has enough power to take it
you can see the display is also much
better than before so you never could
see anything in bright light with this
and yeah according to the 30 km/h so
it's beeping I will remove the second
motor obviously yeah it was not fully
charged I just attached it for 10
minutes but as soon as it reaches some
particular battery level it starts to
beep so I'm with one single with the
front motor now according to the
speedometer 36 km/h let's see if I can
take this part with one motor
yeah it's easily if not I could switch
the second motor on as well
but for maybe inside the force they will
see the light a little bit better it's
really bright I have not my binaural
microphones on you but it's already with
one single motor it's really fast so
they really much faster than my previous
scooter this is the third gear now we
also have some kind of alarm so if you
want other if you need to warn someone
in front of you right it's really fast
so without limiter
I will try maybe second gear second gear
seems to be about as fast as the third
gear of my old scooter yeah around 25
kilometers so you can pretend having a
weak scooter with 25 kilometers limit
it's becoming rainy as well so bedtime
to fall try out so I will add the second
motor now it becomes even faster faster
and stronger
so with two motors second year already
manages 27 kilometers per hour of course
I have no idea if this is a correct
value well it's definitely much faster
than my previous quarter
yeah just see crimes easily here with
second gear I couldn't take this I tried
it once with my old scooter but again
downhill it wasn't well but as soon as
there was some ramp it was impossible
yeah I have no guts to turn on the 3rd
to fit the third beer here because it
would be too fast so I have even to
brake a little there can be some stones
and gravel here so I'm really a little
bit afraid and now let's switch the 3rd
gear with both motors and it's really
lots of fun
also build quality seems much more
sturdy than my old scooter yeah but I
really I cannot keep the throttle down
all the time because it's becoming a bit
too fast for me I mean it is just a
scooter I'm not protected in any way no
helmet nothing you can see lots of stuff
here yeah I think this was it we have to
stop here I hope it was not too dark but
it's becoming dark already 8 4 I hope
you enjoyed the short ride as well
unfortunately becoming too dark too
quickly sorry for that but I had to take
it out and do it first right immediately
without waiting without charging and
it's really lots of fun completely
different experience compared to my old
school for much faster much stronger
also a little bit more dangerous so you
have to know if you take out the limiter
or not but I will do of course a more
detailed review soon yeah thanks for
watching guys I have to get back from
where I came it's starting to rain so I
will get my head come again and if you
interesting you can watch my back ride
as well but yeah I'm quite impressed
with this much better build quality much
nicer practical practical usage so you
can really use it in town not only on
flat parts which what the old one was
not that suitable for yeah thanks all
for watching and see you in the next
video have a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
