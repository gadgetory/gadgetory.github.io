like to take another look at the teen
audio people in here but this time is
pro version that the two is quite highly
rated in impressed by many like audio
budget who has it in his leaderboard
also there's good guy better video
praises it highly maybe remember I
already made a short video about 32 but
my unit was defective left and right was
playing out of phase I returned it got
my money back and then I saw that an
improved version or photon mezrab
exactly the same price as mine $50 and
here it says clearer more delicate
treble rich emphasized bass up to
natural vocals so I got this one it took
a while to arrive and the de truth I'm
not sure if it's really better than the
normal one I thought you don't have the
normal one but I measured it and I
measured this one so we can maybe make
some kind of simulation I will bring the
response of this one to the response of
the normal one and we can compare if the
new one sounds really better but first
let's have a look yeah nothing has
changed the box is exactly the same also
the in it looks exactly the same comes
with these complete it's it has sounded
great with this completes it's still a
very treble heavy in here so far from
balance everything is everything else is
quite balanced but the treble is just
overwhelming
still I think although the companies
reduce level slightly it doesn't sound
that great I think it sounds better with
some other in tips these are new those
were not included with the normal
version these are normal sony hybrid
tips and I think with this it sounds a
little bit better still it emphasizes it
emphasizes travel more but also makes
the treble nicer somehow so before
taking a listen I would like to show you
some measurements here first in gray you
can see the old normal tin audio tip ooh
and in black that in audio t2 pro so
what has changed there is a slight bass
boost now bass is still quite flat but
you can see a lot has changed in the
lower treble there is some boost now
between 3 and 10 kilohertz compared to
the old version which I think doesn't
sound really that great the normal t2
was already quite a treble heavy in here
I would have hoped that they bring it
down but they boosted lower treble
instead and it's simply too much but I
created an EQ curve which brings the
response of the t2 probe down to more
less the 2 level this is the green curve
so this is the t2 pro measured with my
EQ
so it's more less the same as the normal
tea tool and let's have a listen to both
first the t2 pro then that he put in pro
equalized so it should simulate the
response of the Tito and at the very end
the original trade and let's discuss
later on which one sounds better and
we can do
am i searching you I wanna feel
I think you could hear the t2 or let's
say the similar type t2 sounds even
better than the t2 pro without this
harshness the slower travel emphases
it's just so much yeah the basis may be
nice it slightly elevated there is also
a trick to boost base even more there is
some some port here very small one if
you cover it by some putty or some some
tape it increases base I tried it but it
makes it rather some boomy so that puts
this way too high like this is great so
the base is nicer than on the t2 but
travel is is too much there is nearly 10
DB boost at 7 kilo Hertz this is not a
normal and not a not natural response
therefore I'm a little bit disappointed
and yeah I would rather suggest to take
the normal version instead of the pro
which is more expensive I didn't notice
any differences with meats just treble
is more boosted here especially Noah
Trevor yeah maybe take the normal one
and try to fill the treble overall with
some no unfortunately there are no
acoustic filters with this size so you
would have to again maybe try some
toilet paper mode like I did with the
iowa but it would be interesting I mean
this is 50 dollars so it would be
interesting how it compares against a
rather neutral sounding in here here I
have the final audio III thousand I will
make an own dedicated video about this
later but this is maybe nice because
it's a completely complete yeah
opposite of this it's another one
sounding not exaggerated but with
slightly recessed treble it's still ok
not I don't know not muffled but simply
very relaxed sounding compared to this
which which is really aggressive so
let's compare how the three people pro
sounds against the final audio III
thousand which was also I think 20 $45
so not much difference and at the very
end I will give you my resume
is it just a dream my baby inside my
fantasies come to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from my heart of
you
we can't be
am i touching you I wanna feel
so in my opinion the final audio if 3000
is much better much more relaxed sound
much smoother much more natural and not
quite sure how people can praise this
although the people seems to sound a
little bit better smoother than the
people pro it's still far off it's way
too harsh the trailer is just maybe if I
was 70 with some heavy trevorrose
hearing loss I would maybe enjoy it I
tried and after some time you maybe get
used to it but it's not how you should
sound therefore all this praise from
good guy bad review and all your budget
quite cannot follow it it's nothing
really that exceptional one man's job
it's one of the most discussed what do
this certain they say it's one of the
most popular sub $50 in-ear monitors
I have not sure why because it's really
not that great yeah maybe with some what
it can it can be brought to some more
neutral response some more acceptable
but this trend is simply overwhelming
maybe for deaf people who don't hear
anything above 10 kilos it would be nice
but looking at the response again you
can see there is heavy boost at thank
you notes which gives you some some
ringing and together with this lower
treble boost for the pro version yeah
I'm a little bit disappointed
I wasted again some money I should have
elevated for this 1111 offer and get a
normal t2 again but this pro is just
yeah waste of money I like that it says
it is slightly more bass and 5 DB more
for TB but still I mean I like the flat
response up to 3 kilohertz then it
becomes although at me
also they claim that sounds that is
somehow burrowed I don't think so I like
the p3000 way more because when an
in-ear sounds natural the sound also
appears much more realistic than with
some boosted one so I hope you liked it
my take on the T 2 and also t2 pro I
would probably if you liked well heavy
sound I would rather take the t2 the t2
pro is too much it just it already
becomes rather a cassette zs6
although this one is still more extreme
and
way worse but for $50 gets the ìiî
thousand or something cheaper many more
alternatives are coming I will prepare
some fella reviews but I wouldn't
suggest that it will neither that it
will not a deep t2 pro if one of these
then definitely the cheaper t2 so yeah I
hope you liked it thanks all for
watching and see you next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
