Galactica suite from Simon gray for the
Galactic diamond box model mmm this has
just arrived finally I already made a
quick unboxing video to birth my son I
will post this later on but now I wanted
to go out immediately have a listen
outpost as it so loud definitely the
best speaker for an outer party while
still being small and lights around 5
kilograms similar way to the JBL boombox
while being way louder currently I have
nothing at home which can really compete
here but next time I will ask my friend
to borrow his JBL boombox so he can have
a listen to both but loudness wise the
JBL boombox becomes a joke so this is
only a first teaser to give you an idea
about the sound about the loudness of
the speaker and this time I would like
to play only music from Simon grey
thanks to you he managed to reach
hundred thirty percent for his upcoming
album for his pledge campaign you can
still pre-order his album for a limited
time afterwards there will be no chance
to buy it will be an outstanding album I
already heard samples so it's really
great if you love new J's new funk
groove
I suggest whatever effusion Simon grey
is the man
so I will play some heels of him some
all the tracks remixes and so on as if
you don't have your headphones on please
put them up now and let's have a listen
I will turn a volume to make some more
again so I can control it directly from
a headphone it's currently at 2/3 and
let's continue with collecting a sweet
and you can hear that it sounds really
nicely natural so not boost it in any
way you should expecting some kind of
bass heavy boom box sound you might be
even disappointed but the great thing is
that he keeps this level up for maximum
were hardly any bass reduction just some
slight limiting so if increased volume
way louder individual boombox other than
the need this high loudness white still
having another light speaker only five
kilograms yeah next truck is from his
upcoming album called Akuma
I sort of exist
so the quita do a great work here
and very complex music he does here so
you like new jazz fusion Punk
electronica Genesis Simon Grace the man
one of the very best attract another in
exceeded no bass boost either so if I
reduce volume you hear the the
sentiments are applied doesn't do any
fake bass boost party for some this
might sound maybe boring compared to a
real boom box so using volume again
there's just a little insight and analog
one is an ethnic optical so obviously it
starts a great job here next track is
from his life and Facebook operation
services life recording recorded in the
studio
here the sweet incredible you know and
really really like more than 15 meters
away
it's long and maybe do some slight
compression this is obviously the limit
up at the stratospheric type
something else hungry also bit lots of
funky house music also remixes for the
high alternate their batteries becomes
many completely effects is no it sounds
great
or some slight Revlon
let me reduce volume again it sounds
Isis I would say around 60 up to 80% of
course still greater mixing but some
tracks can make it get a little bit
suffer is really festive holiday to
death this is reeks of an old and the
Crusaders classics from the same is
called sweet and sour
new generation autism
that's all just really keep in mind this
is 5 kilograms so controller wait for
the JDO boombox way louder is all and
feel the whole space here to music as
small are initially required indeed
sorry I'm really cold so maybe another
fact also really can hear that it sounds
really really great
even after maximum all ethnic Simoni
while our speakers tends to reduce they
do strange processing compression the
diamond box really thick segment
they have another threat from him and
except Annette in kind of house called
Samba Samba Norah
and ROTC's main instrument
Simon brings definitely demand I must
confess I'm a big Simon Griffin and now
I'm a big fan of the diamond box I chose
the model M is it still quite portable
unlike the model L or the XXL five
kilograms so comparable way to the JBL
boombox but way way louder becomes
better the higher you turn it while
other speakers reduce bass start to
compress and so on this is really
incredible also if you really like great
music if you like this style future funk
new jazz and so on check out the
PledgeMusic side of simon gray you can
still preorder his album for a limited
time only afterwards it won't be
released officially maybe if he finds
some label in 2019 who knows but this is
the only chance for you to get some
really great outstanding music yeah I
cannot wait to have the full album I
love his music and everyone who likes
the style incognito I don't know even a
little bit of snacky puppy inside so a
mixture of everything and I think he
promised when he reached if he reaches
home 30% he will have the drama of
snacky puppy play on his album as well
yeah
Diamond box is quite incredible we will
of course do many more tests also
compared against the GBO boom box maybe
it can even compete against the rival
boom store excel which is more than
twice the weight 10 kilograms I think
this has I measured it so the big
battery option has 5.3 according to my
scale the one with the small battery has
been all 5 kilograms I think 4.8 or 4.9
but I thought I mean if I want a speaker
that can play that loud I want it to
play for a long
according to diamond box it reaches 10
hours at maximum
I haven't measured it yet I mean it's
okay like let it play with this loudness
for 10 hours not sure but I will maybe
try to do a test battery life test as
well
yeah thanks all for watching I hope you
liked this first little teaser of course
many more videos are coming up also I
will include it into my database as soon
as possible probably next week so stay
tuned
have a nice
and bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
