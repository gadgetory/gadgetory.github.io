and come on I have to show you something
this is just the rice I'm kidding look
this is right yesterday I just unbox it
this is the new river once module system
I thought we'll check it out tutor so
take place you're on it so far and we'll
check it out so we will never when I was
always asking about a portable speaker
it sounds like the Sonos play:1
something compact but still with a
serial sci-fi sound I think that we were
originally smaller that not only does it
have all my contractions but it also
support airplay Google cast it can play
it from a USB Drive it even supports
high resolution or you're something
that's honest doesn't and you can see
there is an optional battery pack so you
can really take it with you people said
we portable speaker like this and the
best thing is it's terrible why the son
of a smaller I thought they would place
some tracks so you can interrogate them
it's not easy to switch between both
life so I'm sitting from my server and
yes I'm controlling the river with this
iPhone and there's almost with this one
I will play effect from suppose on
Constitution and the revolving offenses
: d something more jazzy or you should
also hear that nice sound h20 good song
so best wishes and completely free
but the interesting thing is the huge
River Festival which will check now you
have to switch again so we are festival
airplane and let's try maybe this one
every listen it's really kicks that
photo is optical in so you could use it
as a sound bar
screaming over a play no apparently for
my server
all sort of low levels very nice dynamic
based adjustment for easily loudness
included very full sound image at low
levels
what you should go away big father
because it will be too heavy part of it
I want to tell it
so I think they are really impressive
there will be a new software coming out
in two weeks which will enable some some
more functions I'm quite impressed with
the repairman sounds really great and
this portable so you can really take it
with you I think it would fit into the
turbo ex back so it's a nice people form
and you get this really serious - yeah
what do you think do you like it hey how
are you come on come on get in I have to
show you something
- Nolan you already the 34th and Sony
control of ecology and identity services
for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
