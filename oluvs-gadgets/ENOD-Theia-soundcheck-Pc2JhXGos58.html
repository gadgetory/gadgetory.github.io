speaker this year we will have a look at
is they e not via via some Greek goddess
or Titan or the protoplanet
which crashed into the earth and formed
the moon later on we can see it on
Amazon for $58 its
ipx7 rated so completely waterproof up
to one meter for 30 minutes it has 5
watts and it can even work as power bank
so we have the inputs or outputs yield
let's look at the packaging yeah via
this was yeah this because inside here I
think there is also some carrying loop
inside here even some carrying that
everything falls out so what's this this
is their carrying no not sure how to
mount it but maybe this is yeah this is
their screw with it what is for here we
have also some tripod mount yeah maybe
there maybe it's not like I don't know I
have really no idea I haven't even tried
it a USB wire to charge it through micro
USB and yeah of course we would like to
know how it sounds so let's turn it on
first and there are some interesting
welcome tones it should connect to my
phone and the volume is not synced on
between speaker yeah this is the
confirmation tone that it's paired so I
have to increase volume to maximum here
to have the entire volume range and
before having a listen maybe let's check
out some frequency response measurement
and you can see well nothing that
special there is some obvious treble
peak below 8 kilohertz which makes the
sound a little bit harsh maybe based
also already at 200 Hertz but there is
some deeper response even down below 60
Hertz
unfortunately the bass level is not kept
highest through some DSP so the sound
always remains a little bit tinny except
at higher levels where the speaker
really starts to pack some punch and it
can play really really loud so you
I thought we will check it out how it
sounds yeah it's designed to be a more
omnidirectional speaker you can see
there are some feet below so you can
place it like this but thanks to the
Pasiphae tur here it will vibrate a lot
so you will definitely hear some
rattling when it's placed on a table
let's start with the first track as
always I'm using binaural microphone so
you should listen with headphones you
can hear this peak at around 7 8 you
know head and fell is also in the
directional another speaker I have here
is the Omega m4 or is it the m5 m4 also
rattles a little bit because the Pacific
that here is hidden inside but we can
compare how these two sound may be so
I'm starting again with day you know
no makeup they tests a slide
well emphasis but I think it's also with
this better not as full as their inner
fear but simply more pleasant this is
the typical boost you get here when you
boost because it's below ten kilos if
nothing else you can try placing the
maybe tablet there is hardly any trouble
loss from the Omega
it feels sounds okay
while you can hear some vibration and I
think it sounds better as a more
directional speaker but we can finally
the maximum loudness and I will try this
trick I will stand up as the keynote P
is really really loud so increasing
volume to maximum we can be a no
distortion from my face with as many
Omega L so at maximum maybe let's try
the taotronics pass X that pass X is
quite a bit larger but also cheaper than
ve not via so maybe not a fair
comparison but for nearly half the price
it could be still an interesting
contender also pretty loud so let's
check out these to compare I will start
with a track from savasana and again
they interfere first so please have a
listen you can also hear that the very
first fraction of the song is always cut
off at the beginning there seems to be
some some noise gate also at low levels
there is definitely some some slight
amount of peace you can definitely hear
it here and it will become cut off when
yeah when the music stops so the very
first second of a song is always a bit
missing I will switch over to the
perfect
it appears slightly more muffled maybe
hasn't hit this from peak but sounds
also fuller and
some terrific yet she from happening
let's run our track the not that
direction is simply missing any trouble
because there is no parables nothing but
this sounds quite keen compared for
volver alcoholics is not really a very
speaker I will stand up again and let's
check the net maximum lady so this is
there how tronics now yeah I will have
to increase the unit
yet if a chronic sis or at least it
appears faster but the fear doesn't have
any base so it's really loud if you need
loudness and we have to annoy your
surrounding of course it might be nice
but it doesn't have any any real punch
so it sounds best I would say it around
maybe 90% but if you crank it up higher
the base gets lost a little bit
so yeah the Optronics despite not being
as loud I think sounds more convincing
so that you know Thea is definitely an
interesting speakers it's so loud so if
you need this loudness outdoors and so
on it could be a nice choice but it
would need a little bit more of
refinement this strange peak at around 7
8 kilohertz should be toned down also
upper treble is slightly missing
especially of exes yeah also for low
levels doesn't sound really that
convincing I mean any other cheaper
speaker like the Xiaomi me sounds better
than this but it's loud rugged and and
waterproof yeah it has some punch
especially here when you put it closer
to your ear also the welcome tones are
really really bass heavy I will turn it
off and you will hear it so yeah there
is some bass but it would have neat need
to be kept high with some DSP some some
active equalization yeah not sure what
to say about it for my own use or taste
or whatever I'm not an impressed I would
be impressed if it didn't have any hiss
for all levels also if there was some
dynamic bass boost as it can really play
now it has some potential but it's not
really it's not used to to you to the
limits let's say so for my own personal
use it's not that great but I'm sure
many others will like it as it sold out
and I know that many always SK which is
the loudest and this is small
and loud so you could maybe like it yeah
coming up next are some other new
speakers just released so stay tuned for
more until then have a nice time and see
you then
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
