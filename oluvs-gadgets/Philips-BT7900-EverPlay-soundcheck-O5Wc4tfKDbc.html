going to look at the new release from
Philips the ever play or the model
number is bt 7900 this because quite
nice and interesting it's weatherproof
has 100 hours of standby time yeah more
of this later and some other gimmicks
like the strap you can see here is
actually the USB wire for charging so I
can take this out and you can charge the
speaker with this wire so no need to
take any wires with you just yet simply
use this one at the back you can see it
is simply a micro USB for charging
auxiliary but nothing else and now to
this standby feature you can wake it up
remotely if I pick it up through my list
here phillips bt 7900 it will turn on
automatically this only works if the
speaker jumps into the standby mode on
its own so after five minutes of idle of
being idle it jumps into the standby
mode otherwise if you turn it off
manually there is no way to turn it on
remotely and of course you would likely
release now it sounds as this is the
most important part I mean it looks
quite nice also not too big but although
a solid performer I think it acts a
little bit especially compared against
some other comparable containers like
this JBL fit for example as price is
also quite similar the Philips should or
is announced with 120 euros and should
be out in July now while the JBL flip
for cost $99 so it's quite a bit more
cheaper but sound wise I think it's a
little bit better but before having a
listen let's check out maybe some
frequency response measurements and you
can see that the feels middle initial
but there is also some lack of bass so
the bass is not kept at a high level
also at low levels there is no
additional bass boost while at high
level space is reduced even further so
now let's compare it maybe against the
JBL flip phone which is one of the top
performers in this class of course it's
better than many others but as you can
get the flip for for the same price I
think it's quite fair I will start with
an instrumental track from sole persona
and with the philips bling first so
let's have a listen
you can even hear that the frequency
response is nice and smooth but the
sound legs a bit of warmth fit for it's
quite a bit more punch also also it
harshest on thanks to this treble boost
the Philips sounds nicer overall just
with a lack of bass me
something else maybe some
rap songs election campaign so let's go
go on caucus is that strange
a dancer comedian who kept kick will
increase volume a little bit so both
will stop so reduce fatalities with
Philips here it remains nicely
controlled so there is no distortion no
strange
droning or something like that from many
other speakers and maybe let's listen
how they perform and high levels at
maximum so this is they see lips
increasing volume externals
not that loud so the clip for to be
disabled odor
therefore it still remains nicely
controls voice slightly louder maybe
within my page so I would say the
Philips place on a similar level to the
flip three maybe not quite in the same
week as they flip for but still quite a
decent speaker so no flaws at all also
like this gimmicky a USB wire here that
you really in case you forget it for
charging you always have it with you
this is quite nice
also the standby feature is nice
although not really work through I mean
if you turn if I turn it off now there
won't be any way to turn it on remotely
anymore it has to jump into this tent by
mode on its own yeah I think it's a nice
bigger a little bit overpriced currently
maybe the price will drop then below 100
euros not sure if it will be released in
the US as well but it's already
announced for Europe in in Netherlands I
think an already order it for 120 euros
nice but I think you can get better
speakers as well so it's nothing
revolutionary let's say yeah I hope this
was helpful you can also check it out
from my speaker audio database
I already included it and compared me
maybe against the flip 3 or some other
speakers if you can compare it against
some other all the Philips because like
the BT 6,000 which maybe is the
unofficial successor this sounds much
better the BT 6000 was ca was quite
quite crappy but the sound solid just it
would need a bit more bass maybe you
could
you could see that the the curve rolled
off quite quite smoothly but the base
could have been kept at a higher level
it's saying so yeah I also wanted to
introduce you our new roommate
Lily therefore meeting a little bit of
dirt here mini nearly just that you know
why I don't manage to clean everything
really so so this is Lily
she is very living very lively lovely
lovely lovely and Lily so plastic my
plastic and she is just she banks my
wires off my microphone has fallen out
so yeah really
let's say goodbye to see her at all so
this is Lily and let me taking the
microphone again she pulled it out of my
ear and yeah I cannot make that many
videos now because she's very very
living very lovely I think is the
correct term and yeah it's hard to get
some minutes for for yeah some sonic
minutes so thanks a lot for watching and
see you in the next video have a nice
time and bye bye
you know devoured suits ability to adopt
