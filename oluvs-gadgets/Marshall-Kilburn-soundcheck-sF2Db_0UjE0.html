something really special here today that
I would like to present you this is the
Marshall kilburn the first portable
bluetooth speaker from Marshall and you
see this is really serious I mean this
is not some ultimate toy but it's a
speaker for real musicians designed like
an old classic guitar and from the 60s
and 70s with this nice classic speaker
grille Marshall logo a fox leather
finish carrying grip here
the controls are rather simple three
Dyas volume bass treble with a classic
on/off switch they run really smoothly
everything feels great and expensive and
many will be probably asking can it be
charged through USB no it cannot but you
need a simple two pole wire that you
plug in it and then it will be charged
the battery is replaceable by the way I
haven't looked inside but it seems to be
opened easily and in case the battery
dies you can buy a new one I thought we
should have a listen how serious it
really sounds so we will get inside I
will put in my normal microphones where
a head cam to give you a kind of
first-person view first-person
impression how it sounds
live so please put up your headphones
and enjoy let's turn this baby on and as
Marshall has a long history with rock
music I thought we should check out some
really heavy rock let's have a listen
and pay
Hey
Hey
you
not heavy enough let's try this
of course such a comparison only makes
sense if we have something to compare
with unfortunately I don't have any
speaker in this class although wait a
minute
something something new came in this is
the JBL extreme they hardly fit you on
the table but I think we managed so
let's have a listen if the JBL can also
manage some rock I'm starting again with
their Kilburn
Hey
maybe they are better with something
more groovy or something more modern
hey can i I bought it whatever know it I
seen it every other but never on Korres
Medici we'll take a look like we keep up
Sarah's on again choreography
maybe we should check out how loud they
can play I am keeping the gain of my
recorder still the same but it is this
will be too loud probably so I'll put
them up here and then go back and this
way we should hopefully manage some
distortion free sound I'm starting again
with the Kilburn
okay now let's try some chess again
turning up to maximum
I think post because I really dissent
the marshal rather suitable for rock
while the JBL more for modern music both
are not what I would call flat or
neutral sounding but they make lots of
fun so decide would you like more modern
design or more classy look thanks for
watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
