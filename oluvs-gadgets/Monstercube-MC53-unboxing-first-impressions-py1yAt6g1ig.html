Sundays but we made some nice atmosphere
with this lighting here together with my
son and some packages arrived yesterday
so I thought we should unbox this
together yes this is of course a speaker
I found this on Amazon this is a speaker
called master cube MC 53 it goes for $26
and when reading some reviews someone
claims that it's better than a fig tree
it's better than a little s4 according
to some so I thought we should check
this out yeah I bought this as I was
really curious to see and here I'm
wearing binaural microphone so we can
immediately do some listening not sure
if we will do some real review as well
but this is just the first impressions
and timeboxing so you can see the
speaker looks a little bit maybe next
time you play a to copy yeah small and
yeah but pretty nice design nice fabric
finish this is Bitsy's is a success for
some real leather so this is quite
impressive for this price you can see
there are some see probably some some
stickers on it here so what else is
inside and dirt yeah yes it is about in
clan so to speak on the rock
you can see this if he cut play like be
seen so yes it's done it all immediately
and check this with yeah yes Alton's but
let's see if we can find it in there to
customer charging for it is MC 53 and as
it should be better than their feet
three we will compare it against el
Libre the custom in a comment will be
harmful Michelin yeah so both are
connected love and run on what real
volume but inaudible nobody
Oh No these are the roller hockey so
keeping impressed for a second let me
get some heavier vibration now lay it
down pull maybe hello
doesn't seem to be a low-cut filter this
whip cream yeah maybe not the tip base
for thinking national talent
a bit awkward here come eat now - no
comparison I would say we're sleep we
see smoke pit let's try the PDK a 25
which is also a pretty low budget
speaker for twenty five thirty dollars
for quite comparable this pool also this
sounds much more fattening I would find
out a trick come on
hold on our way right interesting volume
curve according to my iPhone I'm still
below half while the GDK already played
Norfolk infinite in one place oh you
have to admit
let me read some time radio quality to
eat I'm gonna let me down
come on man put on my boots and a lily
white dress a million words but how to
express what I'm feeling and I see it's
a smile how do I get this happening
I look you and of course got everything
you walk over and ask not really that
great so anger is better than that click
create with a statement so the bass
sounds nice if you increase it but apart
from that overall sounded sickly
come on much me
no another one said that is better than
the little which of course is polishing
so I'm not sure what the viewers are
really hearing just because there is
some lower phase vibration this does not
mean as a speaker country yeah yeah this
people are not higher than anything
Wow yeah
listen to the different
and maybe consume it even contaminated
on here lvl now time we can check how
loud they complain so this is the MPS 53
master cube
so no I cannot really share the opinion
from the others that it sounds better
than asleep three people four and four
you think I've got the keys Norfolk
traction on tongue I'm a skeptic Kamali
Sasha yeah so I'm not that impressed all
the videos I mean for twenty five twenty
six dollars but it needs some heavy
equalizing we will try measuring it
maybe prepare some some EQ presets to
make it sound a bit better I think there
is some potential but there is
definitely no kind of DSP processing
included so I'm not that impressed a
little bit of a disappointment although
still for those being on a on a budget
could be decent but this past - kisses -
nice if you know me happy his name well
it's not that great I would say like the
reviewers here suggest so all of them
one doesn't like it that much
all the others are pretty impressed
excellent sound and volume I mean it's
not excellent it may be acceptable
so still looking pretty nice definitely
some some design elements from the bill
play a tool also built quality looks
quite decent or thought the sound would
definitely need a bit more of adjustment
so hope this was enough for a for an
unboxing first impression of the master
cube m-53 we will definitely check it
out a bit more in detail but I can
already tell you now that it's nothing
that's great especially yes compared to
some others so thanks for watching have
a nice time and bye bye I don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
