video showing a an asshole
well no this is going to be a video
showing some issues I found with my jpn
flip three just yesterday I'm still not
sure if only my unit is affected or if
all units have the same problem only the
black units I'm not sure but maybe you
remember when I put up the JBL flip
against the UE boom yesterday or two
days ago it sounded like that
and now it sounds like that please have
a listen well there's obviously bass
distortion regardless of which song is
played for example this one has the same
problem and the first time I discovered
this was yesterday when I was on a walk
with my son I had the speaker attached
to a rucksack or to the strap just like
that and some time later I heard some
distortion on a song my thought well
maybe this is the song but then I
started hearing it with every song so I
thought the speaker became broken I put
it back into the rucksack I came at I
came home in the evening turned it on
and it sounded perfect I mean no
distortion just clean sound so I thought
it might be there then passive radiators
or I don't know maybe a driver is broken
but I cannot localize the problem with
this somewhere in the center of the
speaker so I told about this problem a
friend who also owns a JBL flip 3 and he
had the idea that it might be some
thermal problem the speaker became hot
it was hanging there in the Sun and you
know something inside became loose or a
seal became a soft and then this farting
can occur but obviously the speaker
healed itself when it cooled down so I'm
not sure if it is if it just the
temporary problem or a production
problem or I don't know
so this day I tried it to say doing the
same I let it in the Sun for 20 minutes
so it's Evening Sun like that so not hot
anymore
I played the song and as you can hear it
it's distorting of course I wanted to
initially I wanted to make comparison
against the JBL charge too many were
asking me for this but currently I
cannot I would have to wait until it
cools down again and of course I will I
will ask for exchange and wait if
another unit has the same problem I will
probably not go for black this time but
for some lighter colors color that
doesn't absorb sunlight nning that much
but I just wanted I mean I don't want to
make this pickup bed in some way it's
really a great device I in some ways I
even prefer it over the JBL charge too
because it sounds more natural not that
bass heavy but the sound is smoother
it's nicer overall it's also small I
mean you can you can put it into your
yard into your pocket the battery life
is really great yesterday during our
walk I had it for some hours then in the
evening during my tests and as you can
see I didn't charge it the battery is
still four four dots so it's really an
impressive device so I don't want to
make it bad but just demonstrate D show
that I discovered uhm maybe it will be
gone with my exchange with my new unit
that I will hopefully get soon but maybe
it's also a general problem that affects
all units I mean I was also the first
one who discovered the distortion issues
of the JBL charge tool so why not be the
first one footage who discovers problems
with the JBL flip I hope it's not this I
hope only my unit has this problem but
who knows of course I will keep you
updated yeah
if you all own a flip 3 already please
try it let it in the Sun for 20 minutes
not more then try out some songs and if
the bass distorts you know that that you
are not alone I hope this was helpful
for any owner and yeah thanks for
watching bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
