quick first impression video about the
new Sony SRX X before it is I know that
many are already quite curious and also
impatient about it so am I so I rushed
out yesterday in the evening into a
local store as they got it in stock I
arrived there five minutes before
closing but still I could grab on as you
can see so I thought I will share my
findings with you I only had some hours
but still I thought you might be
interested how it sounds and how it
looks and so on I left it a bit darker
today so we can see maybe has the
Lightning effect a bit better as I think
this is also one of the main selling
points but of course the most important
fact is the sound and I think it's a
little bit of a mixed bag it has lots of
potential but I think they screw it up a
little bit I will put the charge three
against it so many know how they charge
the sound so we can immediately have
some comparison I will start with a
track from soul persona and princess
region which is called analog we all
know this well so we should know how it
sounds is always done of course using
binaural microphones therefore please
listen with headphones I will start with
the sony xba-40 first
it's playing with these default settings
when I unboxed it here it was said like
that
let's switch over to their charge screen
and although we know that the charge
here comes Wyatt clever problem it
killed some fears of funny you can hear
it constantly muffled it could really
try turning off this extra bass here
becomes lightly petrol traps brigand
you can hear that the bass is nice and
deep this boost bass but also a smaller
base slightly but it's a little muffled
I would use volume static thank goodness
there is some equalizer built in here is
in so it's this elimination and we have
some mid treble and bass control so what
I would do is yet turn up and treble
completely and in case extra bases
turned on for these levels I would turn
based or minimum I would eat for lower
levels
I would even boost me slightly and now
it sounds back to this better let's
compare it against to the traction
can be a trusty nollie front cooler and
also slightly bedroom extra another pick
for lower levels it boosts bass as you
can hear the charge free will sound a
much thinner so the default settings are
way to to boost it you cannot listen to
music like that
therefore for lower levels I would
definitely boost travel to maximum
reduce bass maximum in case you are
using extra bases I think this is quite
nice it also boosts lower base but but
boost bass too much overall so for low
levels of even maybe boost needs to
maximum although the higher alternate
the sound changes again we have again
some kind of sound Committee on which
changes the sound all the time at
maximum it reduces bass boost treble
boost meat so at maximum I would rather
reduce meat turn base up to maximum and
cliff trellises here
let's switch again for the trash leave
it click hired we have some early night
based on come on track you can hear a
lot a small should be around six to hurt
as well it place it slightly that's why
the transcript or you can hear they have
similar patients on bottom you publish
irrevocable you can return up basically
maximum reason
I am not ready so that tells me I should
rechargeable the battery says yeah you
can hear it reduced bass already on a
place it reduced volume but mister is
still at 50% so I cannot turn up volume
anymore we have to turn it off easily
obviously there is still some protection
built in some more battery protection
and yes that becomes weak the speaker
cannot reach its maximum volume I
couldn't test it yet but I hope this is
not yeah
this is at 50% it shouldn't it shouldn't
reduce volume that much on our track we
can hear some nice sound but only see
closely adjusted this here let's reduce
space likely even more
I love mutters don't you obey symmetric
you can also see some of these lighting
effects but you can change change here
this is a wave this one that we operate
to shield it chill is more chilly what
is also nicely and maybe stroke only
flashes like that
I will switch over to the HSV again it
is constantly it is more rapid now we
can he has a nice sound has changed an
animal it is so cool it's more blue
ready
warmer costly Otis web welcome so let's
leave the race mode and you can see it's
not really yeah within the timing how a
little bit off so it just flashes but
not really without demo with the music
come on a song what's right from hip-hop
dresses Bangkok flag it's been a while
but emerging in my project like rapid
skinny shots exact bike when you finish
this race to make some amount of making
my pairs are you messing Amata
judging them from the hell while you are
in the fan over there without a pipe
when we click on our backs up your rap
career the dialer my yo you can with a
mostly only is God follow levels you get
so much as it moves based in hell so for
all levels disease
yeah not here able but as we are
listening at higher levels now you can
leave it at maximum area yes the rat can
let's try not special
you can see have a lightning try to keep
up with a rhythm
yeah please charge at 50% so I really
cannot show you its maximum volume now
as yeah it wants to recharge already at
50%
I will try another time and yeah let's
stand out and that will play them
immediately at maximum but there's
really disappointing this is a typical
Sami that they faked a better life and
then reduce volume so this one is next
the caffeine made private sector some
other school funding
Ricky nicely played here hands on my
arse is maximum to keep the lower base
overpaying at mixing because it's hard
for the comfort of difficult now
come on thankfully Turnbull
oh yeah okay please charge in now this
is maximum volume it's ridiculous I'm
not sure what the engineers are drinking
it's only but the strange sound which
becomes very booming at low levels then
again thin at higher levels so that you
have to increase base to maximum is
quite a bit strange there is potential
you can hear it sounds great with some
adjustments it needs this extra base it
needs travel boosted to maximum
otherwise it sounds muffled even more
muscle than their JBL Ashley and then I
would play around with these settings
for lowlands I would turn up turn down
base completely while leaving extra base
on and it makes them you can yeah
turn up space - makes me there is some
compression so it tries to keep the base
somehow it maximum but you are losing
punch and not sure if it can compete
with the JBL extreme it's a different
Union you could hear it has deeper bass
not as boosted why the extreme has just
the 75 Hertz or 77 Hertz boost but
knowing deeper bass this place down to
55 Hertz which is quite nice I think
yeah it's okay I'm quite disappointed
because of this battery issue at 50%
already telling it that you have to
recharge you can see it it's an old
charger with 9.5 volts you can of course
pair it with another one for stereo or I
think up to 10 also quite interesting I
think I will grab the smaller one the xB
30 as well so we can compare this less I
think the expertise more contender for
the charge free this one should rather
compete with the extremal so price-wise
$250 or 230 euros is a bit deep I think
it's nice but it's still missing this I
don't know why they couldn't boost
treble or why they didn't add Twitter's
or something else it's so muffled in
with its default tuning I turn it on in
my car immediately and I was
disappointed for payment what's this but
with some adjustment it's quite nice
also for low levels very very mature
sound but still it's lacking any any
real sparking or
detailed sound so this was just a very
first impression of course a more
detailed reveal will be coming up I'm
impressed and disappointed at the same
time so it's as I told you it's kind of
a mixed bag
yes let's turn it off can hear no check
up moment everything this is nice so you
can turn it on and can listen also at
night it's really low level to get this
deep bass it's warmer than a Hammond can
go and play or if Oslo it really boosts
this lower bass part
but you have to adjust treble and EQ
sometimes the yet doesn't recognize the
speaker not sure why so can to refresh
and it doesn't do anything I I have to
reconnect or turn it off and on so
thanks a lot yes there's not an unboxing
that lets a short look in box as well I
think there's not much inside just the
charger I haven't even looked inside I
just had a short lesson and not even
three cycles keep it as this battery
charge obviously some manuals ten
manuals and here it is there's some
international flock
a pity they cannot they don't manage USB
charging like Venables indeed for the
nearly 17 no huge speaker with USB
charging not sure why Sony and many
others don't manage this as well so you
headed here the sony xba-40 just the
first impression i hope you could hear
the sound compared to a charge which is
of course much cheaper also smaller so
it's not that far off but it makes them
of course their sonic pegs lots of punch
not far off also because of treble they
should have edit Twitter's this is
already quite big this rather so and
also treble dispersion is not as great
of X's but yeah still I think many will
like it
boost bass to maximum at extra bass and
play some you've got boom boom boom boom
and they should have fun with it yeah
except when she tells you that it has to
be recharged after know how long I will
of course tested at maximum and I really
wonder after how yeah after how many
hours it first starts to give you this
this voice prompt and also reduced
volume I'm really curious the extreme
manages 5 hours 5 hours 15 this should
at least manage 5 horas a maximum
without reducing volume otherwise it's
quick so thank you all for watching I
hope this was helpful as a first
impression and see you in the full
review or in another video up coming on
soon so stay tuned and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
