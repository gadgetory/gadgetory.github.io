ever look at something completely
different
two pairs of students the moment kh8 II
and I not micro monitors not quite
comparable as two of these cost around
thousand euros or even slightly more
these 300 or even below you can also see
a size difference so I would say this is
professional-grade this is rather
consumer grade these are also equipped
with Bluetooth these of course not have
only XLR and normal inputs but both are
tuned for a flat response so they should
sound the same or less of course I would
like to demonstrate you this I'm using
burner microphones you are already
hearing now so I'm sitting one and a
half meters away from you I do this so
that you get an idea about the room
acoustics here that it's really as
realistic as possible of course you
should listen with headphones this is an
important premise for binaural
recordings they don't work well even for
studio monitors as the frequency
response is of thanks to their hand
acoustics and so on so please put up
your headphones now I would set them up
and let's have a listen its more common
for me please monitors to place them
closer than usual so the listening
distance right now is about one meter
one meter then the distance between this
because it's also one meter more less
and of course I try to match levels as
good as possible you can see some SPL
meter order we will do this with big
noise then women's first
there are 60 to be
also substantive others we need to hear
some difference in rendering of this
noise so I should hear this also is some
music despite both being tuned for its
great response
I set a level which is usually common
for studio recording studio monitoring
so we should get around 85 DB average
and let's out the first rate from some
gray called Takuma and first
anyway the promotional packages will be
missing damn you Bashar
something eats my casa volunteer stony
sweetie
high-pitched
poetry's not for me I'm so in love it's
slowing down Canton Street is so extreme
it's like it's been holding on and hold
it now you and I we've been chasing all
the butterfly
I think it was quite obvious I hope you
could hear it the no mass death did he
hit the edge here although both still
sounded quite similar which is
impressive without in the small size of
the eyelids here but the 9-month could
have played way louder i couldn't crack
them higher because the recording with
this dot but currently they are said 294
ppi output level you can see there are
some settings here at the back you could
set them to 114 dB
I'm not sure if they would manage but
they really have lots of headroom there
are some other settings for placement
currently there's for freestanding you
can set them to smallest medium that's
large test some other settings and you
can see they also have a network input
they have some things included currently
it's not working it but in future maybe
in summer there will be some software
you have eight parametric equalizers so
you can compensate for room acoustics
you'll do some measurements then with
the software you correct with filters
and the great thing is that the filters
are all face corrected so unlike these
which screw up the face slightly
therefore also different imaging but
this you can really yeah you can hear
the instruments the positions it's
really impressive but of course higher
price also I would call them a consumer
model while this is rather for a
professional user still really really
impressive
but also nice from the I lot here that
they have to spend so you can kill them
up I'm definitely keeping the adults
this was sent to me by a friend of mine
so thanks max yeah it's incredible
I wouldn't have expected them to be that
great of course you have to listen in a
sweet spot they are not meant to fill
the whole room with music but you have
to sit as this wave right here focuses
the treble - I don't know pinpoint let's
say I will keep your eyelids from my
desk yeah they sound really great if you
don't exaggerate but I'm having them
like this half a meter away so at these
levels they are incredible they don't
have this refinement of the Normans here
yeah but I couldn't put them on the desk
I wouldn't have placed one piece you can
see really small have great response
down to 150 Hertz but then it high
levels of course the small pod starts to
struggle a little bit
I measured both and you can see here the
adults with neutral settings and here
the environment also with neutral
settings but please take this with a
grain of salt as there is still lots of
room influence despite the new field
measurement and you can see both measure
more or less flat although there are
some differences of course rather you
can go the base part as there is too
much room resonance but you can see that
adults start rolling off at around 50
Hertz the Norman's a bit earlier but
baseball is not as steep so yeah both
are really quite impressive out there
but this element for a professional like
these for an average user like me I
really like them at my desk in a
distance of around 50 60 centimeters
they sound really great don't have this
precision of this year but still a
really impressive piece of speakers
which give you this true sound
unfalsifiable I guess I formerly I used
the both computer music monitors they
sound nicely parties wiped the floor
with that completely simply being much
more precise also much more faithful
true to the original signal so I like
them a lot
thanks to Max for lending me them I will
of course try to include both into my
database I want to use the alerts as my
future reference for any other videos I
will record them in a setup set apart
and also set closes with a usual
Bluetooth speaker so they are more
comparable to normal Bluetooth speakers
but will hear this sound today getting
out before most because including me if
you follow the thief also has sweeter
Trevor maybe but yet still they are
really really impressive so what you get
here for 280 I think the lowest price I
saw was 260 so they are really great
yeah nothing else to say I hope you
liked this video
different also I hope music was not too
long but I simply wanted to show your
most aspects of these because as with
some tracks yeah you get more details
all of these while other tracks these
sound may be a little bit different so
yeah thanks for watching and see you the
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
