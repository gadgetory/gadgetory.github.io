confirm or maybe even past amid that an
external M improves the sound of
headphone allowed to compare to a
smartphone in my case an iPhone 6 so
definitely not the greatest here I have
a Sennheiser HD 600 which I like a lot
because of the rather flat response so I
also use it for monitoring of my videos
recordings and so on but I read comments
repeatedly how can use it with an iPhone
it improved so much through a decent
m-base improves dynamics improves
whatever well I tried it and I can
hardly hear any difference so I thought
we will do this as a kind of blind
listening test so you can tell me is
there really a difference here I have
the involve M from studies audio that I
already presented some days ago and we
will this use this I have also an other
one but I think it's quite a decent one
also with this valve so you get some
valve magic yeah already where my
binaural microphone so I will switch to
this you can hear my voice changed and
it's already equalized for the
sennheiser headphone
i will start a track here simultaneously
from the iphone and from from the
computer here attach the sennheiser to
my iphone first let's put it on you can
hear how the color changes when i when i
slide it out
so I get best response rather not with
the ear cuffs centered but rather put it
up then I get back
not the end
so to me yes yeah the M sounds a little
bit maybe less
sparkling mm maybe the iPhone sounds
more digital I'm not sure but of course
it's hard to judge the difference in
sound when there is so much time between
switching so I will do this again record
both one after the other and then we
will do the switching afterwards but I
won't tell you which one is the source
so yeah we will discuss this later on I
will select three tracks or something
and yeah let's hope there is some
difference
next wreck
and clasp or at least some rock
so I was switched over to the clip-on
microphone again and I try to do my best
to equalize the Sun in such a way that
when I listen for my binaural recording
through the sennheiser HD 600 it sounds
much the same as the original tricks
when this influence Anheuser HD 600 the
iPhone was playing close to maximum so
one not below it's already closer to its
limit
but the volume was enough for me and use
my voice is a loudest reference as if
you would hear yourself talking so you
could hear it's loud enough I could make
it even slightly louder and tell me
could you hear any difference does it
really play more dynamic better and more
bass heavy through the amp and not quite
sure I can maybe charge this better
after having edited this video but so
far yeah I hope you like this video I
hope you could confirm or bust the myth
tell me in the comments and I will
reveal this yeah in some time maybe also
in a comment or in the video description
so I hope you like this video thanks for
watching and see you in the next one bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
