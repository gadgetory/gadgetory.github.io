to make an auto demonstration of to both
sounds and with all speakers playing
together in party mode or stereo as you
can see I decided to go with a small and
the big one is I don't quite think it
makes sense to get two equals because
here with a small one if I want
something more portable I simply grab
this if I need bigger sound or higher
loudness I take the deal one nice thing
is that they still sound quite similar
comparable so they work really nicely a
stereo you won't notice that one is
smaller or the other but you have the
advantage of having two different ones
for different purposes and or maybe not
the best sounding portables because I've
ever heard they do really a great job
thanks to this 360 degree sound
dispersion and also connectivity
quite stable I can set them apart
several meters and they still play
together so for filling my godness music
they are really great
some people ask me how does the sound
interval plus compare against a fee for
slot well of course they're also offers
you a much more hands-on but only if you
listen exactly on axis I would have to
turn it around all the time
while here I simply put it there walk
around and still get the same songs from
everywhere I would like to demonstrate
you this how both sound compared to a
fee for law so the most realistic and
immersive experience you should of
course listen with headphones
I will also wear a head cam for a kind
of first-person view I still get
comments like I listen to this for my
band box well then you get crappy
and mono sounds you really need
headphones for the best results so
please put them up and let's get started
let's play some music
and I will get over there the thief also
is already standing here and they will
also try connecting the small we both
today revolved us
but first let's switch over to the c4
slow maybe you can hear of exes there is
not that much difference and to connect
them you'll need the rosette hope it
visible break one about the other and
both should play first in party mode but
you can of course also switch to stereo
and no stereo
and switching over to the thief also
again so it is quite a bit of a
different experience
Costigan's because I could also sit here
maybe they're both both again
all right let's bounce a bit in Halifax
something more Jessie maybe they're
Muslims it gets a bit lost because it's
just a point source also if I walk
around here
we're closed again they fill out this
place quite nicely spot also when I move
around in my garden so this is the oslo
playing now now again both both speakers
you can hear it quite a different
because of how many directional sounds
also again this is quite nice although
it's playing in neutral knowledge we can
hear a bunch of the drums here but yes
the truth is not really much less here
in this case not effect
where he falls law I would have to come
in front or turn it around all the time
she falls again there is no comparison
although it's one of the best because
it's not the best portable one it cannot
fight compete against this here so what
we'll do now maybe is taking one I will
reduce volume a little bit and we will
take the small one down to the tools and
the nice thing is that although they are
playing scary I can still control volume
separately so the one above plays soft
but here I will increase volume a little
bit and can lay down here to get a bit
of Sun while my wife or whatever can
listen to music softly if I didn't hear
the connection is still quite stable we
are involved I've six users or even more
apart and three temp of course also
change back end
and yeah well increase warning here
remorse and still listen here you can
hear it still here Abel softly but we
can of course increase volume here as
well
and track control or is also possible
from the master the big one is the
master in this case and also switching
to party mode is possible directly
through a speaker but I think it doesn't
really make much sense because they are
mono anyhow so pressing weaselton class
makes them a plain party here there is
not really much difference I would let
them stereo and simply have left and
right plane now let's bring the big one
to the pool and let's see so you can you
can make some stereo sound at the pool
because if they are mixed now this is
not work with any JBL speakers apart
after water they always lost connection
but you can hear we have some nice
carrots on here without breaking
connection one of course echo I could
get inside the pool now but oh it's just
16 or 17 degrees so the season started a
bit late now
another track you can hear sounds really
nice and regardless where I sit move or
whatever I get an iced out usually with
all others because I had to turn them
around all the time depending if I was
in the pool or outside the pool but you
this is a really nice setup really next
time I will get into the pool and to
have some listening from inside the pool
still don't know how to out oh yes how
to mount all my equipment inside water
you can also get somewhere else
doing some green party maybe just things
the big 100 softer now I really love the
360-degree sound so let's put in here
maybe
another song look how nice and
controlled I play and you can hear there
is some change because of that
reflectors with the circuit here after I
usually put my other listen to them if
some branch where I could hang it maybe
beer I hope it won't fall down and now
we have a kind of hanging lamp here and
listen to some music
and yes regardless wife's it they always
found quite nicely now I will separate
them again pretty simple just take this
one away and the big one will continue
playing what why I like to have two
different ones this I would like to show
you now I will simply turn off the big
one and take the small one now and we
will go for a drive and if my car has a
pretty crappy stereo we will use the box
instead it fits nicely into a cup holder
upside down and because of only
directional sound it doesn't matter how
you place it so let's start the music
I think it's a mess here
the temporal console here first off with
maximum resonance try contract
I think it's loud enough for this person
what I'd you speak
and going back home but not to forget
the speaker I'm home a bit late but at
least the pool managed to warm up until
18 degrees in the mean time so as I had
promised to get inside I'm here now and
we'll have a listen again to they're
both hangers involved plus and the other
one over there so I hope you enjoyed my
little video I hope it was fun let's
have a listen to an analogue from Seoul
performing princess Suja thanks for
watching and bye bye submerge my hair
because I'm wearing all my equipment and
actually turn it that lot because of my
neighbors that my son is also sleeping
already
official here called a run more analogue
from so Kazan and Princess freesia
Mysterio and we can enjoy that sunset a
little bit
lady make this mask its head louder
don't play around 60% another song I
think you can hear if I cost both
playing together
some more one more egg so thanks again
for watching and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
