really interesting speakers the FIFA
Helsinki which is maybe what I think the
best sounding portable speaker I've
heard so far and the Bank of San Pio
play a - both are quite comparable they
also have a similar price tag both
companies are from Denmark
all speakers are green and both look a
little bit like handbags as you can see
yeah a little bit uncommon for a speaker
but of course the main differences
between these two are that the a2 is a
360-degree speaker so you get sound from
the front and from the back while the
FIFA Elson key is a more traditional
high five - on speaker
of course I tried measuring both and if
we have a look at the frequency response
measurements you can see that the a2
measures a little bit like some mountain
landscape so it has deep bass it has
some nice shrill treble but well
everything between is a little bit
woolly while if you look at the FIFA
Helsinki especially with the late type
tuning it measures like a straight flat
rat line of course you only get the
sound if you are sitting directly in
front while the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen do play
it - emits sound in a 360-degree way so
I thought we will hear how these both
compare as always I'm using high quality
binaural microphones you should really
listen with headphones to get the most
realistic result so please put your
headphones up and let's have a listen to
these two first let's not - listen at
lower levels which is definitely a
strength of the band all of you play -
while they're v I don't think you rather
prefer high levels I'm starting with the
FL dinky first
that they can hear the different
approach to Santa tuning very strong
emphasis on higher treble also bass is
pretty dominant but the meats sound a
bit Hollow
if I think he has a much more natural
sound of course this changes if we start
moving around the room the lemon also
maintains the sound quality also from
behind you can still listen well
while for the before you simply have no
seats directly in front
I ain't wist warm slightly and put this
because a bit far away you know you
won't crank them when sitting directly
in front let's have a listen to a
classical track from Tchaikovsky
starting with the 50s thank you first
yeah think you can hear that this sounds
a bit artificial
not like some Orchestra but more like
some synthesized instruments
yeah there is something wrong with that
frequency response
maybe some chess
you
she may be also like Russian Russian
dance music
with some retro 80s kind of disco sound
even more ated although this is a modern
threat from savasana vocals are
somewhere trapped within their I don't
know how to describe
they suddenly became more reggae so
let's listen to some blues rock
now I increased volume is more and put
them closer to the wall let's have a
listen again starting with the F if I
was in key first
you're playing a to start swallowing the
whole dynamics the drums have
disappeared only hi-hats and cymbals
have remained this still sounds like
original recording
yet becomes some sizzling strange kind
of song let's try something else
also very dynamic electronic drums
yes again yet the subsidy strange we
still lots of punch with expansively
let's try the 8 oh yeah base from has
disappeared I have to finish my delay
here
I would increase volume to maximum
involved doesn't go any louder
it became a toy speaker
we are given that 360-degree song won't
help anymore
a different track
yeah I don't know I mean it's trying to
be loud but the penalty
let's try this last wreck
now all dynamics is simply missing here
ya know this is a joke doesn't make
sense to compare yeah I think you would
hear it if you want the best sounding
hand back yeah this is the FIFA Helsinki
while the Bo play a2 is not a bad
speaker but simply compared against the
FIFA it sounds a bit toyish especially
at high levels it's close to unusable
also battery life is really ridiculous
at maximum volume you will get 50
minutes then it drops exactly to half
while with a few fighters in key this is
not some battery King but I measured
more than 20 half hours it makes a
moment you could hear that it's it
sounded still powerful and was also
louder than the and then a - so yeah I
hope you liked this video yeah I hope I
could convince you again for the FIFA
Helsinki as I think this is simply the
best sounding portable speaker while
being still portable I mean you see how
small it is it cannot compete against
larger speakers like the I Phi X s 99 or
even the larger FIFA Copenhagen I hope I
will get a Copenhagen soon for
comparison and we could maybe try
putting the Copenhagen against some
bigger speakers like the boom stir Excel
from toyo or the Iowa XS 9 it will be
interesting to hear how a high-end hi-5
portable speaker sounds against some
boom boxes like those so thanks again
for watching I hope you liked it
yeah please vote up when possible please
support me and we will see us in the
next video thanks and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
