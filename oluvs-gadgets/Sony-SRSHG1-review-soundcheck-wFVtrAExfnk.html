have a more detailed look at the new
sony SRS hg 1 and to tell the truth I
was really looking forward to test it
and I also expected quite a bit but now
after finally having heard it I'm not
that impressed anymore maybe it's also
because of the bang on all of simply
play 1 which simply stole the show for
everyone else but the Hg one still
remains interesting because of its
features it has Wi-Fi included maybe the
smallest speaker I've seen with Wi-Fi it
can also act as DAC you can see it has
two USB ports one is for charging the
other one access interface for the
computer so you can even stream
high-resolution audio it says here high
res audio but it won't make much sense
we will see later on that the frequency
response is pretty limited so it doesn't
matter if you put in 96 kilohertz files
or some crappy mp3 you probably won't
hear any difference at all here we have
a button which switches between
Bluetooth USB audio in or network you
have some it has it supports stereo
pairing with another one also and this
is a magical button to remove the grill
so we can have a look inside to full
range drivers to passive radiators one
here one at the back nothing too fancy
it sticks magnetically and of course I
would like to show you how it sounds
as always I'm using binaural microphones
so please listen to that phones and the
Sony comes with an own app the song Tao
it's not very stable sometimes you have
to reconfigure the speaker again after
restarting it and it has also some yeah
it jumps back and forth it has some
what's this test some equalizer settings
or we are starting with flat so let's
have a listen a song from Seoul persona
together with princess freezer
and it sounds yeah
just as the setting suggests flat not
very well defined so here we have the
extra base button and now it improves up
at low levels the extra base can cause
Distortion I will turn it off again or
let us leave this without with extra
base yet they are boosting it too much
already at low levels of course we can
have a look at the frequency response
measurement and flat is indeed pretty
flat but there is some treble missing
above 12 kilo Hertz there is not much so
turning on extra bass improves treble
quite a bit but it boasts based so much
that it's simply overwhelming at low
levels you get a boost of 20 DB and yeah
this is what we've heard this results in
some some distortion and also we have
strange droning but you also have a
custom equalizer which can maybe improve
the sound let's see if we if we will
manage I tried to flatten or improve the
sound a little bit more and came up with
a setting like that you have custom
equal EQ and when setting treble to
maximum with based on maximum and 330
and 3 kilohertz reduced slightly we will
get a sound like that I am starting
again with there with the same song as
before
it becomes a bit more full-bodied not as
Extreme as with extra base you see this
is horrible
let's try that again okay it's too flat
what's this I don't know what they were
smoking let's switch again to extra base
and when we measuring the speaker with
this custom equalizer setting you will
see that it's even flatter than flat I
mean it's you boost treble slightly you
also get better bass response but it's
still not quite there we can compare it
against their old sony SRS x-33 and
although not perfect
this was quite decent but I will leave
the custom EQ on now and let's listen to
another song starting with the X 33 now
to be loud
x-33 deputy sounds more exciting Mira
somehow more sparkling I will try extra
base no so bad is gonna take whatever
one people
body might say that'll be allowed to
smile gotta love yourself anyway
let's run a track and you can already
hear a bit of compression we are well
close to maximum already so it's not
really that great but you can also hear
that the x-33
does strange stuff the bass sounds as if
it was playing along the music I will
increase volume slightly on the hg1 as
well and we are already at mixing volume
here let's listen at lower levels yeah I
don't know it's not really that great
although I really prefer the x-33 for
low levels what we could also try is
comparing it against the the River s in
Europe both costs the same - 49 to 49 in
in the US this calls 499 so it's a bit
cheaper of course
feature wise the Sony has much more
because of Wi-Fi and so on but let's
have a listen how these two sound both
should sound rather flat I mean the
river doesn't have any boosts and let's
check if it if it has power mode
activated on that nothing happens so now
we are in power mode and I start with
the river
and the hg1 with custom equalizer
setting and there is not that much
difference
I will activate extra base maybe this
will make it a bit more sparkling and
excited
in this case the sony sound sitting back
I would say let's write this this is
with extra bass turned on you can hear
some distortion already the river should
play the smaller less clean I will walk
around a bit so we can also hear how
well they disperse the sound they 2g one
extra base is now active and I will turn
both to maximum
but I think the river sounds more true
to the original recording
this sounds a bit yes
forced mr. another friend lots of
compression but we became outcompete
loudness wise here but still sounds
cleaner
I can definitely hear lots of
compression I will deactivate extra base
again I cannot do it remotely now
because the app won't let me do let's
only without extra base with my custom
setting so yes the river definitely
sounds more convincing here another song
they uses any punch I don't know
you can still hear the bass runs and
their beat for this it sounds a bit
small I don't know not really in the
same week as they do play a one there
the river sounds net would be much
better here both are playing a mix in by
the way here
I will try activating extra base again
this is also volume slightly but you
hear no compression from the river while
this swallows all drugs and anything
that's right this river a tapir softer
but because of missing compression you
can still hear the dynamics of the beat
so yeah I'm not that impressed um I
really hoped for more especially sound
wise it's not really an improvement over
the old x-33
also the xb3 convinced me more than this
the xp3 had some problems at low levels
because it sounded muffled and at high
levels it started to reduce bass too
much but this is inverse regardless if
you play it with extra bass on or not it
never sounds right with extra bass at
low levels it there is so much bass that
it starts to distort without extra bass
it's teeny so the best would be this
custom equalizer setting but it's still
not perfect yeah I don't know also I had
some stability issues it turned off
automatically after some time of being
idle and then I couldn't turn it on
again so I had to reset it you can see
there is a hole so they knew what why
they included it after pressing this it
turned on again but it wouldn't
otherwise I tried attaching it to mains
and everything but it wouldn't turn on
and this whole app is also a bit of a
joke after powering on you see it simply
stops
ah now it works but I will try turning
it off and turning it on again and we
will see if it needs a reconfiguring or
not so turning it on it's always in some
kind of standby mode maybe this is
because so that you can use it from from
your network remotely let's check if
there ok it seems to work I will I will
close the app and restart it again yeah
now it works so what else we have we can
stream from home network I have a server
ok I need to have Wi-Fi it won't let me
do interesting again yeah here I have my
media server with all my music it's
really funny why I don't know why it
returns I have my music you can see I
have my folders with ruski Polsky onion
broth sky optimist kovitch I also have
some Italian artists Alex pretty
Dorota Tsukuba Jody brutto jovanotti so
I'm a bit international and I could
stream immediately from here without
using my iPhone just as a remote so it
would it would run directly from my from
my hard drive here let's see if it works
no play mode off shuffle order huh
interesting
let's try again it should usually
yes something doesn't work so you see
it's not all perfect and a bit yeah it
needs some work maybe some favor update
also retune the sound because it's not
not there yet but I think that drivers
are simply not really powerful enough
they cannot push enough air and
interesting I noticed that I will switch
back to bluetooth again
there doesn't seem to be any low-pass
cut filter included so this thing would
even vibrate with 20 Hertz this looks
really crazy let's try this we are 80
Hertz no no nothing let's see if you can
see the drivers and I will go into sub
this have 45 Hertz now 30 20 Hertz
of course my camera swallows you see it
half as I will make it even slower we
are 25 Hertz now 10 Hertz and they are
still moving
I don't know this is a waste of energy
because you won't hear it anyhow but it
will simply distort maybe this is also
the issue while this extra base does
cause problems but there shouldn't be
any distortion at low levels which
indeed there is let's try another song
this kick here yeah this is without
extra bass it's much cleaner but the
worst one was this here
and we are really playing at low levels
so Sami please back to drawing board and
bring us a speaker which really can make
us jump yeah I hope you like this video
I'm not that impressed by the speaker
it's nice and it's not that bad but
overall hmm I think you can do better
especially after having heard the a1
this wipes the floor with any of these
sound-wise much deeper much more mature
sound it doesn't have these features
with Wi-Fi but it as you've seen it can
get a bit confusing it doesn't always
work and not sure why to include
wireless I mean a high-resolution
streaming because we put it together
like that no because you won't hear
anything else above 12 kilo Hertz anyhow
with this it cuts off and and yeah so
not really the perfect speaker for high
resolution audio so I hope you liked it
thanks a lot for watching and I hope I
covered everything but this thing will
go back I really look forward but I
don't have any use for it it's not loud
enough for all to use for endo use it's
not defined enough refined enough and
yeah the whole Wi-Fi section is a bit in
stable it seems I always had problems
with it so it never quite worked as I
wanted but still maybe you liked it it's
definitely better than all the both
stuff so why not but I hoped for a bit
even better performance so thanks a lot
and we will see us in the next video bye
