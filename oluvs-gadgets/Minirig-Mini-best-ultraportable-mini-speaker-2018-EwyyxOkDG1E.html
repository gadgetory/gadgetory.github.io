probably or not have been a big fan of
small speakers with big sound so big fan
small speaker sound BSB this is the mini
mini which I would call me be the best
portable mini speaker currently
available on the market but before
taking a closer look at airing listen
let's take a look at this here these are
the toy for Altima forty- a German
company I like them a lot I have to send
them back
and I thought we'll have another listen
usual of course with some headphones so
please put them up and let's check them
out
sorry small ones here
these are the big ones
sleep in here this Mormons yeah Nihad
perform the huge speakers there but now
let's see the solo and let's take a
closer look
it also listen I will turn them off and
I can also show you some features of the
media recap first let me start the app
and you can see that both appear astern
of here mini minis are quick to the low
energy Bluetooth profile which means
they are always in some kind of standby
mode this allows you to turn them on
remotely through the app you can of
course turn the switch off as there is
some slight battery drain but which
would be minimal according to minute
even after year there would still be
some battery left
now it should appear here within the app
with some additional settings I will
start some playback
we went from Stoppers on uses future
from the latest album and you can switch
between Logan and high-gain Logan is
rather for the levels to avoid excessive
noise floor high again is for higher
levels which should boost volume by 6 DB
we also have a nice 5 band equalizer as
you can see I already boosted treble
this is the standard setting mini with
minis are tuned for that response listen
from an angle 45 degrees but most of the
time you work from the put it flat and
this equal 1 or so I prefer boosting the
EpiPens slightly here also these four
lower levels I prefer reducing the
presence region slightly as you can
boost it if you want to so there are
lots of options to tune the sound to
lighten brightness for presets or you
can disable this Q log so next time of
the turn off it will revert to standard
circles a very nice feature is within
the settings here violence era log so
once you connect the posterior next time
when you turn on the other one
we will connect automatically no need to
present button and you have a stereo
system so in Stara low levels of course
I should switch to logon maybe for low
levels to get a nice bass boost which
gets of course reduced the higher return
it but the Sun always remains nicely
full bodies nicely beat is hide the
small size of a spirit against them like
a madman and as both have just a single
footage to another act more like some
kind of acoustic one source this means
they have very precise imaging unlike
their Poythress which don't have this
great center phantom center while the
MINIX can act as a real stereo system
but I will and make them again so we can
compare only one to some other speakers
I refer the Soviets very popular the GB
introduces load version their cliff to
starting wars I'm not sure about they
keep three which should be released soon
but I thought it would be any better we
can
comparison justify ridiculous also
excellence
compared to handsome and popular speaker
is the ue roll - hmm
I'm not sure why ultimate years speakers
are that popular because they sound
really I mean it's not crappy it's
better than the GBA clip but still Sapa
let's write an Alfred again mini with me
first
it's not bad but finicky base completely
so there's no response we know nothing
popular song it seems is some battery
drain because I charged it but it's
already flashing here so now we are
connected and I lost the week because
this was still connected here so here
and
pick up the phone you can see sp
I think this wonderful also is some
adjustments
I think
public responses
so let's come to the more interesting
speakers here here very post something
micro it's a flat as you can see but
also mangia so I like it a lot but
against a mini Eric meaning it has no
chance so let me try to place it again a
little bit more Center let's turn it on
there's also some nice features
this typos how to reduce our volume with
some kicks
cause very soft
so little punching all this compressed
quite highly rated speaker the ap2 we
already heard it against me in my first
impression video some months ago so
quite a bit more expensive also
flattered but battery life is quite
crappy at maximum you will hardly get
one and a half hours this would play for
three hours at maximum while being even
louder and an our track again mini mini
first is the dynamics of the drums of
the bass here
because disappear
it's a slightly bigger awesome ice up
estimate and then I want something that
no play doesn't slow they pulled this
feature page at the very beginning that
was the option funkiness ko doesn't yet
some stocks somehow this redistricting
Ruxandra some sausage of some
it sounds CB nice more versatile
thanks to this remote turn on turn off I
really like this feature a lot so I can
another month for my bed and I think two
mini minis compete again with a speaker
like that there and I am in here now
they are placed one more only
directional way but it's a bit unfair
maybe against it then on so I I built
some stands from the phone bricks for my
son yeah a little bit
improvised they should connect again for
Stella
let me see that there is not yet turned
on so let's turn this on as well and you
should hear that the milkman is
sultriness
pilot is the captain beat with the bass
response
sorry
because the cranks there
what are aware that this is not cheap
anymore we are around 300 340 pounds
maybe so similar price to the Benetton
do play v6 yeah and I don't think this
is such a great speaker I will turn this
home especially with this kind of music
it fades out lately as well here so the
numeric system despite not being as
portable as this one this is just one
thing to carry it completely out
performs the p6 here let's write this
truck get married first
horrible sorry no that was usable but I
mean this is not allowed
three spots here this is veno 400 euros
to spend some amount of money for
something really decent yeah get the
mirac knees together mix up if you don't
have the money by just one and this is
the great thing about them that it's a
system and later on at the second one
and you have a great HiFi stereo system
and that the variant at the sub or and
by America meaning with us up and this
will already outperform this p6 here
which cost 400 euros I think it's in
America this up will cost you around 300
know this maybe 270 I'm not sure about
the conversion rate but too many weeks
with ones that are still less than P six
and they sound way better as you could
hear at low levels of headers they give
your stereo they give you remote power
on power off yeah I can put them off
through the app so let me try again
it says yes so everything is turned off
so I hope you liked my video of the
numeric - I really yeah I compared it
against anything on the market which are
not the same size even larger and they
outperform them all so
is a small British company it has its
price their handmade hand handmade head
made in Britain not made in Hong Kong or
something they are made by hand
somewhere in Bristol yeah I'm not sure
how many employees they have maybe Penn
know it's a small company but still
managed something outstanding compared
to big companies like Bank dolphin or
JBL I'm not sure but I think that
2-minute minutes with the SAP will
outperform the new GB extreme - I
haven't heard it yet but it should be
released soon and we'll definitely put
them against they mean at the new TB
extreme I think they are simply better
also you can separate them you can add a
second sub if you have the money
yeah I cannot I cannot produce in
English I have to applaud for what they
achieved here with this little system I
like them more than the normal mini Ric
and I think it's definitely worth the
price therefore I would recommend anyone
who looks for something really small
rather annoyed this is a decent speaker
but compared to the mineral it's
ridiculous it's not something like this
if it was broken or negatory
so I hope this could give you an idea
check the most out to my database they
are included with different sustaining
one as a two point one system I will
also try to add them as a 2.0 system
with us up maybe place more directional
thoughts the microphone and placed flat
with some equalizing from the app I like
it more with a little bit of a therapist
if I listen with a flat placement like
this
so yeah nothing else to say go for it
there will be others having anything
metal so 2 minutes of once a person is a
killer system it kills nearly everything
else of course there are limits loudness
wise so they are not as loud as I don't
know yeah they are not about the same
madness is a column called name were
being way smaller
GBL boombox still this song simply
better more HiFi and more versatile and
just nicer more synthetic synthetic I
don't know so thanks a lot again and see
you in the next video have a nice time
bye bye
I'm your father
but system and the karate hey Gopi and
Ilana honey I do scoreless in ski
michigan's fresh leads the horizon shown
as follows never visited for tanta
hooray
so initial pass hmm navasana mouth antic
just 50 mph remember idiotic Treecko</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
