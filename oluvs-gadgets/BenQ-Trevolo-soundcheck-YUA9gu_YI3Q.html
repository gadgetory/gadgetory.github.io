the first electrostatic portable due to
speaker that Bank you travel or travel
Oh
Unum appropriate Aliano machi cuts envoy
dear a travel or travel is Seema travel
Oprah
no no so so this is an electrostatic
speaker quite a bit different from
dynamic speakers and you can see the
wings here are the electrostatic drivers
I mean I don't want to go into detail
how electrostatic speakers work but they
are known for extreme précisément with
meats and treble reproduction
unfortunately they cannot reproduce bass
very well you would need much bigger
drivers and they emit to the front and
to the back so you get the same sound
phase-shifted at the back and the bass
cancels out therefore you see some at
the additional drivers here and the
treble is also equipped with two passive
radiators to enhance bass so I was very
excited about the speaker since the very
beginning when it was announced I think
I think one year ago
oh I contacted thank you if they would
like to provide me a real sample but I
didn't get quite an answer until
recently and they asked me if I would
like to review it which is what I'm
doing so I received it some days ago and
I thought I will have a listen so also
to give you an idea how it sounds we
will compare it against some others
because maybe yeah as usual I'm using my
binaural microphones so if you listen
with headphones this is the only premise
you should get a pretty realistic sound
impression also regarding stereo imaging
and and staging and so on
let's turn it on
and as you can hear it has some nice
decent welcome tones
unlike the JBL they went for some really
distracting ones like kaboom for the
extreme and fall for the flip and
probably the upcoming JBL's because
we'll have the same boom so I will set
it up like this why like this well I
will show you because electrostatic
drivers are really on directional I mean
I didn't know they were so directional
but yeah let's have a listen I will play
a jazz song or quite a smooth one and
yeah and look what happens
the treble disappears it becomes a
muffled kitchen radio you really have to
sit exactly on axis with the drivers
it's enough that you move the head
slightly to the left
of the right and the whole magic will
disappear but I think you can hear that
there is some sweetness to the treble to
the mids they are extremely clear but
not exaggerated for example I have the
JBL flip 3 here maybe not the best
speaker for comparison it's cheaper well
not not quite in the class but let's
have a listen how the tables found it's
missing this the staging and everything
at the same time the JPL is a bit
rounder Samba acids it has more belly
the electrostatic parabola really shines
with acoustic material with Gators songs
that have lots of detail
now they flip again
you hear this
it's simply clear but without any crew
mobile streaming it if you are a fan of
treble and and needs you will probably
love that thank you
only keep in mind that you have to sit
really still in front I mean this is
extreme I've never heard a speaker with
such strong directionality but
sleep again
but maybe
you even hear hear that
the third GPO sounds a bit more dynamic
the bass and drums and everything comes
better through through JBL
again another song still you need this
cymbals this nice smooth drums then the
bank you really shines it's so detailed
without being harsh without being
Suellen or something
many speaker designers tend to boost
treble in order to make them sound more
detailed but you won't get any detail
but Rada shrillness and and still the
JBL victory is a pretty balanced speaker
but you easily hear the difference it's
simply for my taste
it's missing some bass and punch the
banker really is more suitable for less
dynamic songs the trivial sickness
it sounds more powerful
stress some kind of jazz bossa nova or
something
it's not easy to match them volumize
because the banker has some dynamics
processing you hear that it's missing
dynamics when I switch to the JBL you
hear the drums and everything the JBL
plays the whole dynamics
why would thank you
pans to of course it's also sounds great
at classics
this is Tchaikovsky by the way your
privilege
you'll get a nice soundstage this is
completely missing from the JBL and
despite well not being muffled it sounds
muffled compared to the bank you listen
to the violins
this is more speaker for really music
enthusiasts classic fans maybe jazz
it's extreme how much detail there is in
this music this disappears a bit with
the flip it really sounds muffled
but if we have for example we listen to
some more funky jazz this is from
resolution 88
there is simply no dynamics nope and the
flip sounds more true to the original
recording you he little bit struggling
at alone keep in mind we are close to
maximum already the drums have simply no
punch no so here
damn it sounds like volume filtrations
where the bass sounds a bit strange I
still have the infinity that I borrowed
from a friend maybe it's not the best
speaker for comparison but I mean they
should cost the same more or less also
similarly portable and you will simply
hear that infinity sounds much different
it doesn't like to connect this special
of the Infinity okay now it's connected
and we'll have a listen again to the
same song I think I will have to match
them volume rise this is the infinity I
will turn it to the maximum No
Samrat
you're here it's extremely compressed
there's a single speaker for rock fans
or dance fans I don't know but more well
relaxing classic stuff and so on I mean
the meet and treble reproduction is
pretty impressive but you really hear
this compression with most dynamic songs
as soon as there are some drums some
stronger peaks and hits you hear the
bank you're struggling also I think it
sounds better the higher you train it if
turned close to maximum it sounds well
quite a bit more convincing than if
listened at lower levels let's listen
maybe to another song what I have here
for example some you hear it it sounds a
bit like a kitchen already or something
let's try the infinity again but I will
have to swallow my bit
it's I don't know it's only when I start
turning it to maximum and you will see
it comes to life a bit I'm turning up
now and the last volume step brings it
to life
but it's not a very loud speaker I mean
if we turn the Infinity to comparable
level we are maybe two-thirds like
ordinary so it's not it's really for
people for audio file audio feel
listeners who really like music and not
simply well noise yeah what I forgot it
has some sound modes but they don't
really well there is hardly any
difference for example you see green is
I think pure well currently I don't hear
anything
and you can switch between the modes but
this is warm and loose Vivek
there is some difference especially if
Vivat makes it really vivid better there
is an app I can also switch to the app
directly this is called and let's switch
to another one leave it pure
Warren becomes too much for my taste
I think pur gives the best result then
of course what do we have we have free
speech or hands-free or how it is called
we have line in you can even use it as a
Bluetooth receiver with linehalt
you need a proprietary charger this
micro USB or is it a mini USB this is
only for probably for updates so I mean
it's a really decent speaker maybe a bit
expensive but for classic listen us and
also jazz as long as there is not too
much bass or too much drums numb because
it's losing dynamics but for acoustic
folk stuff even I think country
everything with lots of guitar and
details will sound pretty decent you
just have to sit directly in front i
hope this could give you a quick and
first dirty idea about the qualities of
the bank you I mean I cannot say if I'm
impressed it's it's impressive for one
part but its overall package I'm a bit
disappointed to tell the truth because
you really have to sit in front exactly
I mean what's what's the point of a
portable speaker if I have to put it
directly in front of me and cannot walk
around because there's auntie grades too
much this was the first and I mean this
is the biggest drawback for me that that
it simply only sounds good if you listen
exactly in front let's try it let's try
this again
okay it stretches it remains me look
it's playing but I don't hear anything
it seems there is some slight park this
wasn't okay when I switch back and forth
then it starts working so Maura I'm
really sitting in the sweet spot
you hear this is
yeah
but you can hear that it also emits at
the backside
but also you must be exactly in the
sweet spot
yeah so for the improvised video but
this was the best I could get in in a
short time I have so thanks for watching
I hope this was a bit helpful please
thumbs up if yes otherwise no and if you
don't like my videos please tell me why
and I will try to improve oh yeah we
will see us in the next video until then
