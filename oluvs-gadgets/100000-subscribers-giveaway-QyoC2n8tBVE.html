have to celebrate my hundred thousand
subscribers that I surpassed around one
week ago and as a thank you also is a
welcome to all new subscribers I wanted
to do this with a giveaway just as
announced so a selective ten different
products mostly portable speakers but
also headphones in the meantime I've
reviewed lots of headphones and in years
I wanted to add some in ease as well but
I have nothing really that I would like
to give away I could have added the case
at s10 which I will probably never use
again but it's nothing that I would like
to get by myself so a rather selected
products that I have at home I don't
need or use them so maybe let's start
with the tribute make sound plus here
it's still written excellent plus this
was a prototype but I will get a new one
and this will go to one of you I think
this is one of the best low budgets
because currently costing $56 but
outperforming most of the popula more
expensive ones like the JBL flip for
maybe you've seen my video it's also
much better than the quite similar
looking sony XP 20 they share really
lots of design elements but the trivet
has the better sound so for everyone who
cares about a natural at a flat tone
sound this is really it i'm quite
surprised what is possible for this
price other companies would ask three
times the money so i hope one of you can
get this next one is also trivet i have
lots of tribute products yeah I have two
of them but I only use one you can pair
them for not stereo for party mode so I
only use one this is the tribute X boom
my summer speaker 2018 waterproof on
directional sound is not as high five
sounding as the mix on plus but also
really great I like it a lot and I would
also like one of you to get it an
alternative to this is the Philips spin
360 MX that's the successor model of the
BT I think 7700 that I also revealed
also quite nice only original not as
basically at low levels but maybe a
little bit more refined than the X boom
so also very nice speaker I have the old
BT 7700 so I don't need this and I hope
one of you will have some fun with it
here I have the trivet extra tune this
is
unique one-of-a-kind headphone because
this one that I would like to give away
I have a second one a normal one and
this was a test I wanted or I tried to
return it slightly so I sent three bit
my recommendation for some some
parametric equalizers how to make it
sound a little bit more maybe high-end I
didn't try to make it sound flat but
it's a little bit bass heavy also treble
is not as we find so I thought I will
try to make it sound a little bit better
it sounds small is the same when when
played through auxilary and through
bluetooth so I thought it has some DSP
so there can there is hardly any any
equalizing going on active equalizer I
thought let's add some I think I used
four bands and I think it sounded much
better so they sent me a unit with an
updated firmware with this sound and
unfortunately during this conversion
maybe from my filters to there it lost
some Sparkle and then I lost I was only
be disappointed I'm not sure if it was
sample variation because the the other
unit also in played through auxiliary
sounded a little bit different and if I
was not sure should I try to refine the
tuning or should I let it go and this is
really one of its kind
later on they said it's too late we
cannot improve it anymore so all you
need to remain like this but this is
really one of its kind model with my
personality tuning but keep in mind it's
compared to what I had intended it likes
some uppers battle so you would have to
add maybe let's say some high shelf at
10 kilohertz with 340b then it sounds
really great
yeah on a really high level I think this
is crazy around 40 50 dollars I think it
would outperform many headphones costing
two or three times that much so a
bluetooth headphone it's unique
there is no other one like this and I
would like to offer this for you that's
what I have here maybe let's go to the
other headphone here the super luxe HD
and 681 this was some year ago when I
tried to find a reference headphone for
all of you this played with my equalizer
and that I provide
back then or with sauna works sounds
quite nice and allows you to to judge my
recordings well it's not a sennheiser HD
6 a lot but it brings the frequency
response quite close the tonality is
okay because without you can hear that
it sounds a limit as some of you may be
noticed I added some headphones to my
speaker audio database this was just a
test so it's not final but I edit the
super-luxe I added the sennheiser HD 58
x jubilee edit some mangled Olufsen
headphones i also added the AKG k612
which is really not bad for I got it
from messed up around 15 dollars so for
15 dollars
it's really a great headphone and you
can compare them back and forth I think
currently there are nine or ten
different headphone recordings you can
compel him to speakers but was this was
really just a test I'm not sure if I
would continue like this my intention
was to create an own headphone database
or maybe something completely new but
it's so much work that I mean not nobody
pays me this my YouTube income gets
lower and lower again although I have
hundred thousand subscribers now hundred
thousand five hundred in the meantime
but I cannot do this with with this
salary that I get and spending hours at
night sitting there trying out something
is I I probably won't manage so just for
fun I edit some headphones to my speaker
audio database which is not perfect it
has many flaws but yeah one I give away
I think five of them and I have still
one left and I would like one of you to
get it and use it with my sauna works
with my equalizer a poor profile and it
should sound really fine so here I have
the little bwa s tool you've seemingly
my unboxing I got a second one is brand
new so it's not open I don't like it
that much it's okay but I think they
exaggerated a little bit with base
it's a bit too much apart from that you
could hear it with some parts it
outperformed even the JBL charge for so
I think someone of you might have some
fun with it I still have the second one
I might do a full review also add some
measurements I didn't measure it yet but
this one goes to one of you
yeah the old classic this is the reverse
I had a white unit maybe remember but I
was never satisfied with this sound it
didn't sound like the prototype that I
heard the first time some years ago when
it was still not on the market it
sounded different mmm and some you later
I know last year I cut three of them
they were on sale three or four i bought
them and they sound a different matter
than mine i will keep one black one this
is a black one by the way I think it's
visible I will keep one as it sounds so
much better than my white unit a friend
of mine got one and I still have one
left
it's I mean it's no I just tried it off
I just tried all the fits if it works
now receiving the invoice inside in case
of warranty or something and I think
it's not the best sounding but is it
some kind of classic for me it still
sounds great and has this elegant look
looks really great on a desk just don't
put it in the center because of the
reflections that the driver create just
rather yeah on the edge or some
somewhere on a shelf is this the problem
for all of these speakers that they
don't sound that great when put put on a
scent of some surface because the
drivers are so close so you get some
reflection some some come filtering
effects and so on
still I hope someone will have fun with
the rivers in the meantime a little bit
of a rarity maybe so but it's a classic
especially for me what do I have here
this is the boom box power and it's
included with him a database by the way
I never did a review it's a kind of a me
directions become similar to the boom
box
what was it boom box I remember there
was an older model this one is more
powerful comparable to the JBL charger
in the ordinance but for my taste
it'll be too much upper base and I told
them
yeah you have such nice sounding ones
like the add-on couldn't hear it you'll
know it's meant to be used out to us you
need more upper base so it sounds more
like a UE boom with more and more bass
overall but I can make a boom let's say
I never reviewed it like just edited to
the database we can check it out from
there
instead I think many will have fun with
it and just laying around doesn't make
sense so I would like to offer it you
don't have another headphone the IVA
park1 bluetooth headphone also added to
my database you can compare it it's not
a neutral sounding headphone quite bass
heavy so it is quite sounded but there
are some nice features like pairing with
another brutal headphone so you can
share the same music with two Bluetooth
headphones at once what else I was
talking to either also tried sending
them some EQ adjustments because this
one definitely applies some active
equalizing so compared to the sound you
get over 3.5 millimeter it's different
over Bluetooth and not necessarily
better so I thought I will use the naked
3.5 liter sound the unequal last one and
put my equalizer on top I sent them I
suggest suggest since again this word
and I never got any feedback but I think
it sounds vanity not mah neutral but
simply more and more awesome more
refined with my tuning then with this
with the original one yeah it's a pity
and they told me it could use different
kind of equalizing also user presets
there is so much potential but ina is a
small company therefore we don't have
the resources to make this possible
I mean imagine an app and people send
their equalizing their suggestions and
you can download it or maybe create your
own because from whatever the drivers
are really high-quality it would just
need a little bit of additional cooling
I don't like this original unit that
much compared maybe against the pure
play h4 which I also have inside I think
that view play
nicer so notice not as rough knowledge
but many like it and I hope one of you
will like it as well so I have two of
them one goes for you and last but not
least here is the old comb blue all
direct I also have it in my database I
think I never did any review it's some
kind of blown up FIFA Helsinki sounds
quite similar his Wi-Fi included what
else is there I mean I don't want to
open it it's green but there was lots of
hype in some German from let me see no
it's still it's packed so I won't open
it there was some hype in some German
forums so great so great so I bought it
I thought yeah it's this scent I mean
some measurements added to my database
and then I somehow forgot about it and
didn't use it anymore I mean I have the
Helsinki have many others so I don't
need it but I could imagine especially
because of Wi-Fi you can control it also
set up a multi-room system with another
one or with some ggmm speaker so I'm
sure I hope at least someone will have
fun with it yeah at first I wanted to
make dedicated videos for all of this so
that you could really vote for this one
which you want but I will leave it like
that
simply leave a comment if you are a
subscriber of my channel and after one
or two weeks I will select ten random
ones by a random comment pika
and then we will divide the products I'm
not quite sure how to how to make who
gets one but I'll also probably make it
by random simply put up all 10 here then
select ten ten ten of you and this goes
to you this goes through something like
that I don't want to - and I don't want
to I just want to make it as random as
possible so everyone has to get the
chance no subscribers all subscribers
but leave simply a comment regardless
what yeah I hope you continue please
stop with YouTube or whatever and the
content doesn't matter I will don't even
read
then just fire up this random comment
peek aside select ten of you one after
the other we could maybe do this life
but I cannot make live streams because
my internet connection is way too bad so
it would probably interrupt so I will
record this recall the peaking life and
then post the video afterwards after I
have edited it so this is my kind of
thank you to all of you I wouldn't have
expected to reach hundred thousand I
didn't even have the intention to do so
when I started YouTube it was just for
fun also to demonstrate the sound of the
bosonic me which bed then outperformed
all others all other portals because
when many people were raving about the
beats pill which was a complete crap
against the post the post is still
nothing great if looking back but back
then it was the only speaker which could
reproduce some base in the size and some
real base and I know many people are
still satisfied with it claiming that
it's the best portable speaker so this
was my origin with YouTube simply
demonstrate the sound I still recall it
with my old camera then later on I
started to to experiment microphones I
was not satisfied how the Sun was
captured so I started using panarin
microphones and this is where I'm now
and now I'm starting to record
headphones as I think yes it's a hard
task quite to to being impossible it's
really not easy you would need probably
another setup but recording headphones
is such a hassle that I really am not
sure if I will continue with it because
it doesn't represent the reality like I
hear it or not with all of them so it's
not that consistent as I would have
liked to say I would have hoped for so I
hope you liked this giveaway also thank
you there will be more coming currently
I don't have that many products that I
can give away that I don't need or I
don't want to give it a the AG pk7 award
because it was nothing special and it's
big so I have to pay the shipping cost
for a huge parcel and then you will get
it and say I know it's crap therefore I
rather want to do I want it to select
rather small
products that I still feel confident to
give away and hope you will also have
fun with them yeah this was it thanks a
lot again that we reached the hundred
hundred thousand subscribers the next
step would be 1 million but I thought it
will ever get so far I will probably
stop before this because I'm really now
a little bit exhausted with all this
YouTube stuff so thanks for watching and
leave simply a comment then I will pick
ten of you and in about two weeks maybe
what let's say yeah beginning February
my son will have holidays so he will be
with me here maybe we'll pick the picot
something together I'm not sure but if I
want to really make it as random as
possible so not to not to influence nan
how do you say in English not to
advantage someone not to advance I'm not
sure simply s random
everyone has has to have the chance so
thanks for watching it bye bye
