time again therefore I wanted to wish
everyone a Merry Christmas also thank
you for all your support during 2018 for
all the donations that I got from you
and as the end of the year is also near
I wanted to make a kind of round up for
2018 but unlike with the last year's
we're rather concentrated on portable
Bhutto's because only this time I would
like to extend it to other products I
have revealed headphones in ears some
wearable devices in the meantime so I
would like to present you my favorite my
personal favorite audio gauge is also
newcomers for 2018
I think if you own them all you're
covered with everything
maybe sound bytes missing I have
reviewed some sound buzz but none has
satisfied me that much that I would like
to recommend one also home speakers like
this audio pro I don't eat 20 so let's
that maybe with some little bit weird
kind of device this is the bose sound
where and on my video about the bose
sound we're against this JBL sound gear
also the name is similar yeah trying to
copy each other was a bit controversial
so I had lots of hating comments you are
JBL hater what is this face when you're
losing to reveal yet the furnace the gb
really sucks each day it's it already
starts that you cannot put it on with
the with the post it's not not a problem
but the JBL is very stiff so it can
hardly get it over my neck or on my neck
is not somehow that or something the end
the sound is just horrible it sounds
like a JBL go straight to your shoulder
when this sounds completely different
also doesn't try to sound like a
headphone it it rather creates this
sound cloud around you really nice sound
at low levels with some additional bass
boost that JBL sound just endemic i
don't know why people don't accept this
that in this case the JBL really sucks
yeah this is quite expensive with $300
in the meantime you can maybe get it for
a bit cheaper but i really like it for
coin outside clean walks also do during
gardening it's it's simply there you
still get everything around you but you
get some nice music
battery life is really outstanding I
charge it maybe every
second third week but when I go for a
walk with my son into the forest I often
use it I can still talk to him but I
have some nice background music it
doesn't block you out so it's really
nice and I highly recommend it but for
this type of device which is a wearable
portable speak our well of the device so
let's maybe get over to them no budgets
because we have tried many in the meter
can get many so nice because discounted
but I think the private X on goal is
still one of the best also mini speakers
this is quite small you can attach it or
strap it to your backpack to some no
helmet ever saw this nice form is my
favorite mini speaker I would have
rather chosen the mini Ric mini or the
Bose Soundlink micro but I think this is
cheaper sounds just as good passing
boost bass as much for low levels but
still sounds quite full but it is also
quite loud so it sounds question of the
to the mini Ric mini but yeah costs way
less battery life is great it's
completely waterproof so really nice
because you get for 35 36 dollars not
the loudest and not the most bass heavy
yeah let some comments the you know the
teen rider is much better yeah but it's
a completely different kind of device so
we are already it's much heavier bigger
not waterproof not as small so I know
people want waterproof speakers they
must be waterproof they must be rugged
therefore my favorite one for 2018 is
the private X X boom yeah I helped a
little bit with the tuning because the
original one didn't sound that great so
I'm quite satisfied with the result
which was not the best sounding speaker
but it has um directional sound has nice
bass
especially with this extra bass feature
great battery life rugged so I liked it
more than a JBL flip forum for example
because it doesn't sound that harsh also
has more bass at lower levels really
nice and it costs $70 currently maybe 65
I'm not quite sure about the price I
think is one of the best
if everything is taken into account then
we have a newcomer their mini week free
which is very outstanding yes I always
mention it it's a kind of modular system
so at a second mini week and they
already sound better than many others
it's not a cheap solution so for - you
will pay nearly $300 but at the SAP and
they blow everything else away in the
size I made a video compared against the
IRA which I will also cover here now
just as loud not with this if they don't
have this extreme base but I think up to
60 70 % they can complete easily while
being way smaller so they're more
expensive so a friend of mine just
ordered a 2.1 set I think he paid four
hundred ninety dollars including
shipping so more expensive than the Iran
but I also wanted to include the IRA is
it still and evergreen it was released I
think - two and a half years ago I was
one of the first who presented it and
there was a time when I didn't like it
that much when there was this European
release because the first versions were
only four hundred ten volts then they
released the European version but it had
some strange firmware which added
compression especially at low levels you
could hear how volume was pumping so I
somehow did like it and it took quite a
long time until they released an
alternative firmware without compression
the compressor can find us on this on
the Iowa side and it sounds again neck
like it did and at the very beginning
when I got it so it's really nice
currently it's discounted so for three
hundred dollars it's it's a no-brainer
if you need a portable speaker a boom
box something more high five it has a
five band equalizer great battery life
and I will feature it again in my videos
for 2019 some news are coming about this
Iowa you will see let yourself surprised
so I think in spring there will be
something regarding this era XS 9 I
really like it a lot and I will
recommend it without reservations
definitely much better than those JBL
boom boxes or whatever other is it's not
the loudest speaker so you could hear
the mimics
justise load then Mickey FreePlay life
was is way louder but doesn't have this
sound this metro Wi-Fi like sound I also
wanted to introduce the audio pro Adam
c3 as a wireless Matt Elam speaker with
Wi-Fi but it is also bluetooth and it
has also battery so it's a kind of a
universal kind of thing I really like it
a lot I use it everyday especially for
not using bluetooth simply have my radio
presets here so I press one two three or
four and have my favorite radio stations
the sound is nice battery life is
outstanding and you can adjust the sound
to your liking with the audio player
audio project so I usually tend to boost
treble and bits or so based slightly
especially for lower levels as there is
no additional based adjustment but with
base close to max and treble it sounds
really nice it sounds very similar to
the audio Pro t3 which you can already
get $150 maybe so this is a little bit
more expensive comparable price to the
era but here you have the the option to
adjust the Sun because for me the t3 was
a little bit too muddy overall and here
you can add this treble its runner boost
only upper treble gives you this pattern
so I really like it a lot
nicely portable also use it at the pool
- range is quite nice so I have Wi-Fi
connection even there so the c3 is my
overall portable multi room speaker
which connects to many other audio
products that c5 c10 and so on but this
one is included because I like portables
because I don't want them to be that
stationary like for example my t20 which
I use as my main home system I tried
many speakers in the meantime but I am
stuck with this here maybe also not the
best one you can find maybe better ones
for a thousand two thousand dollars but
this cost around 600-700 and I think
they do a great job very nice smooth
sound not exaggerate it in any way still
quite mature and made some videos just
have a listen also listen to my database
where also included them I think they
sound really nice they let you adjust
also the sound what I like about audio
Pro is that
the sound adjustment rather work like
some low shell filters not they don't
boost some strange upper base or don't
start too early like with many speakers
they if you boost treble they only start
at 1 kilo Hertz and boost the entire
presence region as well here only the
upper tremor is boosted so the audio Pro
is my favorite current home system
stereo system definitely better sounding
manera because it's 2 speakers you can
set them apart several meters they feel
my room really nicely so I don't use
them in a traditional stereo triangle
but I really set them apart into the
corners of the room and as they disperse
the sound so nicely they don't fall off
that much in FX's they sound really nice
so I would choose the audio Pro L&amp;amp;T 20
as my personal home speaker solution
stereo speaker until I have heard
something much better in this price
range
yeah and now let's switch over to the
headphones and in ears I already
presented and reviewed the Sennheiser HD
50 X Jubilee that you can only get from
mass drop but it's definitely worth it
$450 this is one of the best headphones
that you can get if you like a neutral -
are not talking about any boosted
booming mess but this is for really
audiophile lovers sure maybe a 660 s
sounds better or whatever has a better
sound stage there are many discussions
about this but I think for this price
its 660 s costs 450 or $500 $450 this is
really a steal it does a great job
exactly the same build quality really
nice if you like it more because this is
net while the HT 600 is a glossy so I
like it a lot quite comfortable great
sound easy to power even from an
smartphone so really really nice and as
I did lots of indie reviews lately as an
absolute high-end
in-ear which still costs very little
money I would like to recommend the
automatic er 3 XR it completely blows
away anything else I've heard in the
you're category including those really
expensive thousand-dollar maybe even
$2,000 in years
it sounds really outstanding if you are
after a neutral sound nothing really
colored because yeah a bit surprised
that people seem to like this strange
colored completely unbalanced in years
why this is really as close to a studio
recording as possible
$150 also on mass drop I think on Amazon
you can get it for the same price and up
to 500 600 does all this hype junk from
fire or whatever this completely blows
it away just me you really have to put
them deep inside your ear so you need to
have some practice so to wear them so
hold your ear and then this if you screw
it in and they they have to disappear
inside you until you hardly can hear
yourself your own voice and if you
manage the right fit the the right seal
and after some seconds or minutes you
will notice how the sound yeah it's it's
unbelievable what kind of sound you are
getting not comparable to any other in
here I've heard because it's so natural
so open so so simply yeah overwhelming
the sound I only listen with this when I
go into bed before sleeping I put them
in and and I'm enjoying them a lot maybe
if you've ever smoked some weed
you know how more open you become for
music how the music starts something
different and it's a little bit like
this so when I listen what this is it's
a secure high or something it's really
nice so the the music you are inside the
music you are as if you were in another
world
really really recommended just be sure
to get to get the right seal and the
right fit and as I've reviewed so many
no budget in use as well I would have
rather recommended the Sony mhm one or
even the Samsung is eight bundle but
you've seen or heard
there is lots of sample variation
especially the Samsung I have three
units and they are not even comparable
to each other the same with the Sony
some have problems with their connector
because it's a different connector so
with how with current phones it probably
won't work so we can just sum some
strange sizzling mess therefore I won't
recommend the Sony but the moon drop
Chris sent I think this is the right
name and hidden for $30 on Aliexpress
sounds about the same similar maybe even
slightly better not as booming and yeah
there shouldn't be any simple variations
very nice very nice in here quite
natural sounding I have some other ones
so maybe I will present them for 2019
which may be better I haven't gotten yet
they are stuck somewhere at the customs
for two months but I can definitely
recommend the moon drop Chris and as an
alternative to those Samsung which can
also be fake or to the Sony image one
image one see I think this sounds really
great comparable maybe not as smooth
modest silky smooth with treble as the
Sony but really really nice yeah I hope
I didn't forget anything
this was it for 2018 no boomboxes no
whatever because there is nothing really
that great stiver
just blows them all the way take the GB
boombox which is more expensive yeah
it's waterproof and he can float but who
cares this keeps all the bass up to
maximum is louder cheaper yeah and stay
tuned for 2019 as I will feature it
again with some nice surprise also many
more headphones headphone regions are
coming for 2019 until the end of the
year I probably won't post anything as I
I want to have a short break also when I
reach my 100000 subscribers I will also
do a big giveaway with several products
also of different categories headphones
speakers maybe in years so stay tuned
for a giveaway as soon as I reach
100,000 there will be some nice gift for
you for
my trusty subscribers of course you have
to subscribe to my channel but I I want
I want to pick them rallying around
random way not with a kind of crease I'm
not sure yet because I think those who
subscribe me for have subscribe me for
many years maybe deserve a gift more but
I want to give the chance to everyone
also to new subscribers yeah I hope I
didn't forget anything let me see
so my home solution 80/20 is my favorite
headphone the Sennheiser HD 50 X 58 X
Jubilee my favorite in here the
automatic er 3 XR I also ordered there
for exam it hasn't been shipped it so it
will arrive in 2019 but I think this
will be again a step up although it's
the holiday price I'm not sure if it's
really worth this 5 6 % more sound if
it's really worth I often use the e r3
XR with some resistor adapter which
variants is enough it already gives a
little bit more sparking a little bit
more openness to the sound and as they
are so easy to drive I'm usually way
below half volume on my iPhone the
resistor yeah makes the volume control
little bit more reasonable because at
low levels you can hear already some
historize on amp if you don't use it
with with some resistor so maybe I'm
quite curious to hear there er 4 XR how
this will if they will really sound this
the same because many times they sound
the same but the ER for XR has a
different impedance a high one therefore
I think it sounds a little different
here the posts sound om as a kind of
wearable device wearable speaker
definitely much much better than this
JBL equivalent not sure all those JBL
fanboys it was a fucking mess with any
kind of basically music you you didn't
hear any bass just some alright this
really has bass down to 60 Hertz which
is quite impressive and adjusts the
sound to the loudness level so at low
levels it's it's more more lively while
at high levels of course it reduces bass
still quite impressive what both
achieved here not worth the price so for
half the price I can get
Sennheiser but that's the job so if you
are at work and need some music as both
sides play rather out of phase which is
also you have to get used to this but
they cancel out each other from some
distance so from some distance you can
you only hear some sizzling sound what
if the GBL yeah you could hear
everything so it really disturbed
everyone around you this one doesn't
again the treaded X on goal is a low
budget on round it does a great job I
think great battery life never failed on
me I know I read some comments they have
reading issues not with mine I've never
experienced any rippling regardless of
volume level it never distorts it never
does any strange stuff maybe there are
quality problems
so maybe exchange it one escrow
replacement or whatever as I as far as I
know try it support is really great yet
the only thing I forgot Wireless in is
yeah I forgot to include the traveied x1
as a cheap through Wireless in your
solution I would definitely recommend
the travitt x1 as yet they sound great
they are really small I posted a video
of some days ago so they do a great job
for this price currently in Germany I
think below 40 euros in the US I think
45 46 year-old Dallas so it's a great in
here
probably metal sounding than those
popular j-bird or whatever I have some
from I don't know and it was horrible
also huge so these do a great job if you
are looking for some wireless to
wireless in here check the travitt x1
just yeah try maybe other tips because
with the included ones I didn't get a
good sound again the private X boom as a
as an overall
only directional also waterproof Rockets
because that's a great job not the
loudest so there are a lot of ones but
yeah way louder is the headman Erik 3
it's 1 Sigma 1 is already louder than
the table extreme which is quite
impressive all because of course without
this bass but add this up and it
completely blows away Jamie extreme mega
blast or whatever for comparable price
while still offering a hi-fi high-end
sound and not some strange boosted mess
like those mega blasts and it was not
that bad but the mega boom is just
horrible so you can see the sizes may be
slightly bigger we are around one one
less than one and a half kilograms but
it completely blows away everything at
the second mini week and you have a
stereo system which really fixes so
Mirek is a great newcomer really
improving upon the press credit
predecessor so my way better than a mini
Rick tool which didn't have this pink
relief this one has DSP so nice sound
adjustment for all levels and great
features we can connect several of them
wirelessly can wake wake it up remotely
really nice features still there will be
many firmer improvements it just was
released so there are maybe some slight
box updating didn't work through iOS yet
so I had to do it for Android but I'm
sure it all the time everything will be
fixed
yeah again the audio audio pro add-on
tc3 is a multi room portable also
bloated solution
realized speaker not the loudest so JP
extreme is definitely order but for
normal levels the c3 does a great job
again compare them all from my database
the try bit against maybe the UE boom or
whatever which costs twice as much or
maybe even more so this completely blows
it away but it's not as long again aibi
is the all-around evergreen if you need
loudness if you need great sound if you
need a boom box this definitely does the
trick much better than most others
especially for this price
apparently again discounted for 320 and
I'm I think
rotating again so I hit account
everything you can find links affiliate
links in the video description to all of
them mostly to the US store from Amazon
this is only available through any
Express I think the Sennheiser only for
mass drop so just wanted to give you my
personal favorites yeah let's see what
2019 will bring I know many very
interesting Indians are coming not like
this overhead crap and junk that
everyone else suggests s-- which sound
just off so really interesting ones I
hope they really live up to their home
to my expectations but stay tuned again
I wish everyone a Merry Christmas also
really thanks a lot for all the
donations that I got repeatedly not many
but some are really generous
so another gain some donations for about
200 euros from someone a Swiss guy
really really nice thanks a lot and also
a Happy New Year I thought I will manage
much during this time now twist this
period so we'll have to wait until
January and yeah I have prepared some
videos I have some ideas for future
tests so stay tuned I hope I didn't
forget anything let me see again yeah
sorry about the x1 I should have
included it here but yeah I was a little
bit unprepared maybe yeah nothing else
to say I wish you the best and see you
next year maybe have a nice time at the
bank
