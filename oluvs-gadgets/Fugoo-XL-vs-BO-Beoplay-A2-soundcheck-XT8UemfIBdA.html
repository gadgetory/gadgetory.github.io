comparison of their food excel versus
that bang &amp;amp; olufsen do play a tool both
because only directional 360-degree
speakers but the food we excel is also
ranked water-resistant it can even swim
the band often be a player 2 is rather a
slim model which begs to be taken around
it's also a bit lighter but it has a
pretty weak battery it's rated for I
think 24 hours but at Maxim you won't
even get one hour while the fuku XL is
rated for over 30 hours I still got more
than 6 hours at maximum which is pretty
impressive especially compared against
then bo play a - I thought I'll play
some tracks as always I'm using binaural
microphones so you should listen with
headphones I'm starting with some kind
of acoustic Jessi is listening track R
and therefore XL first so please have a
listen
you know what you immediately notice is
that the panel Olufsen is clearer
but to tell the truth I prefer the full
Excel completely without any cover it
will definitely sound better like that
therefore for this comparison I will
take it out although it's not meant to
be listened like this but you notice
that it sounds clear already and the end
also suddenly became a little bit clunky
I will increase volume
maybe already notice that the food is
really nice spaciousness which is a
little bit missing of the Bennett olive
seat it simply has drivers to the front
and to the back but the fool yourself is
also the side drivers which adds to the
stereo separation let's try now track
yet the terms of the foo XL is missing
here I mean the camel dollops enriches
even below 50 Hertz but it doesn't have
this impressive bunch of the kugel I
will walk around a little bit the elect
levity remains better on the village
sorry if you're playing too but you hear
the punch is simply quite impressive you
get from the fool the Mendelssohn
doesn't give you this the clarity
remains really nice but the sound is not
as powerful
let's try not to pick it's impressive it
also sounds great
exactly when listen like that so the
drivers aim outwards let's listen to the
full excel again
what impresses most with the pool excel
is simply the base punch it has really
some nice warm sound not exaggerated
like the Jade extreme but you have
simply this deep part
let's try another trick yeah this is it
sounds a bit sizzling we've already
heard it against a FIFA Helsinki
especially at high levels only treble
remains I will turn both to maximum
let's see how they perform then
your place well
the food itself always needs a little
time until it reaches the maximum volume
so keep that in mind we are in normal
mode now there is still an auto mode
which is a bit louder astrometric here
you can already hear a bit of distortion
from the fuel cell the pendulum remains
unimpressed but it doesn't have that
punch it's much more compressed
you can hear that the work cell is not
clean anymore it's scratching
look look at the basically a lot of
distortion already
mm optional remains really perfectly
undistorted decreed discussion for sorry
maybe we can fly outdoor mode as well I
mean it's already more punchy like this
and let's crank it again the distortion
becomes tricky serious
here the flu Excel is definitely at the
limit to be listenable maybe outdoors if
you crank it and set 10 meters away it
won't be that noticeable but well it's a
bit too much Distortion
let's transfer the set you play a
Connell much distortion radical but
still pretty punchy compared to the
bellows
I will revert back to normal mode link
it's better that orange is better it's
not as loud but it's all simply cleaner
not affect some house
vamos vamos assassins manage next punch
of the for itself
but what is impressive with the
methodology simply how great it remains
how clear it remains from any angle you
can walk around and it always sounds the
same more or less so yeah I think the
sound is a bit a matter of taste and
preference I prefer the punchy sound of
the food excel or vote totally thought
it really has to be taken out of their
cupboard of the jacket in order to
really get the clearest sound I would
maybe add a bit of treble boost so that
the trailer can also come better through
these material here I mean the Benelux
is a nice device but it cannot play
really loud or it plays loud but doesn't
sound good at low levels it's also not
that great I mean I think the food excel
is definitely the better choice here
also because of this pretty impressive
nice punchy deep bass you get the bends
in place quite deep but you don't have
this punch of the flu excel which is
impressive it's even more is punchier
than the Viva Helsinki but if you think
he remains much more consistent across
the entire volume range much clearer
sounding more natural so it's always a
matter of taste and preference I hope
you liked this video I'm going to return
the been alone I really expected a
little bit more after the firmware
update that we perform together but it
still sounds nearly the same just this
popopo went away but the sound didn't
improve that much so I'm staying with
the flu XL and the FIFA Helsinki for
home use if we will sell for outdoor I
hope this helped you a little bit yeah
maybe you liked the been loves more but
I'm missing a little bit punch and the
treble simply - sizzling already so
thanks a lot for watching see you in the
next video
without been dilution yeah have a nice
time and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
