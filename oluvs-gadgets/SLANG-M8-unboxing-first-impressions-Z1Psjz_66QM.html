again so this is already arrived
yesterday but I thought I should wait
and we will do this together maybe you
are also interested what is inside a
package from China they always bring
some interesting stuff so let's open
this box yeah of course well internal
microphones so you should listen with
headphones or well to get a 3d sound
experience from the box opening and
let's see what is inside here
high end HD audio speaker m4 m8 yeah I
think it's called
slang yes Lang and we have a pretty
interesting inside charger with the u.s.
blocks I thought I had adapters so no
problem boombox
yeah here you have it
so what else no just a an auxilary wire
looks pretty nice let's look at the site
it's only a level on your best so if I
think you can get it for 60 euros or
let's change currency to Dallas
let's make us come on this is yeah
United States and dollars so how much
$66 you can see it's available in
different colors in black golden in
silver black it looks like this or a
funny one is the color mix looks a
little bit like graffiti or something
again quite funny but maybe not everyone
style so I thought the black golden one
will be the most interesting one
yeah Moo let's check it out
two drivers not sure or not these are
not tweeters just some design you know
obviously two passive radiators at the
back we have charging out get micro SD
card play back reset rather looks like
auxiliary yeah strange yeah it needs
obvious obviously and a proprietary
charger which is a pity but yeah maybe
let's try turning it on not sure how
like this maybe no maybe longer
okay cannot turn down these welcome
tones here maybe we are already in
Bluetooth mode what we will achieve melt
what else let's try beautiful I think it
also has FM radio let's see if I can
connect to it here this line m8 armored
cavalry cavalry okay yeah very nice we
put this way here get these are all the
tones we all know them from from
somewhere else and let's check out
something maybe not sure where the
volume is okay this is completely down
obviously
so let's turn it up completely and then
we can control it from their iPhone
a flat media basis Lala miss I offer
you can switch to the next trick or no
play by TF card play by TF card yeah we
can also check out TF card or micro SD
let's see what this does
obviously no DSP inside it becomes
pretty genious low levels so let's check
the other modes FM mode
these are strange really annoys this
little help psycho this sounds more like
some Mars yeah we'll probably find
nothing here
what is aux mode and back to bluetooth
maybe no not sure what to compare it to
here I have there the G boom boom boom
how is it called G boom G project G boom
but I think this kind of quite compete
although this is quite crappy the Suns
may be nice but completely without base
so let's check out maybe these two G
boom is already connected this one as
well and yeah let's try a track
we can
after here it makes some volume in order
to come to life at low levels is
completely unusable this is really
horrible
this is quite a bit you need focus this
motor will base just sum up a bass boost
I won't turn out to make song this is
the G boomer
horrible this one also a lot of the
geometry let's try something else
Oh
I would use welcome again to get rid of
this distortion and here is some lattes
kick
this Suns Hollywood just horrible
it's not that bad actually but you get
pretty big already and it would
definitely need some DSP to really shine
also not too heavy not sure maybe no two
kilograms do you have some glue rests me
I think the look is pretty cool but it
would definitely need more been set at
low level stimulation head high levels
it sounds quite okay here is the
instruction by the way in Chinese I
think it's pretty easy to use
let's switch again I think turn it off
like this probably keep it pressed yeah
I mean the looks are really cool off
however of really great some qualities
yeah you could hear may be some slight
distortion maximum but less than this
one and this was a Bumi mess while this
still had some precision the bass was
there but it's not a bass heavy speaker
so for a first impression unboxing a I
hope you like this let's see if there is
some some Chinese or some English manual
yeah there is frequency response 90
Hertz to 20 kilo Hertz of course we will
do some measurement in the next video
I'm not sure what to put against it I
mean it cost $66 so in the class of a
Vava voom 20 maybe but also larger I
think you can find better soundings
because for this but of course not as
sweet looking like this one I really
like this knobs here remind me a little
bit of Marshall maybe although the color
could have eaten him it would have been
better if the color was the same so
really cold this is already a bit too
yellow I would say this is nice this is
nice but this looks a little bit cheap
yeah boombox slang m8 nothing else to
say for the unboxing no will of course
check this out more in detail although I
you've heard what to expect from it
thanks all for watching and see you in
the next video a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
