the JBL charge 3 against the sony srs XB
3 both because i new on the market and
they should cost around the same like
hundred fifty dollars we've already
heard some speakers against their charge
3 and i think it smoked all of them i
also think that the sony is maybe one of
the few ones that can actually compete
and at the very beginning i was really
surprised how nice it sounds but the
longer i listened the more issues i
found which i would like to show you of
course i'm using high quality binaural
microphones so you should listen
headphones and we will play some tunes
later on but first let's turn them on
and you see the sony remains completely
silent while you get these strange and
unnecessary well compounds from the JBL
including the bluetooth connection yeah
tone which is a bit too loud
yeah the the big difference first of all
is of course you can charge the JBL with
micro USB which you cannot with the sony
it has some flap here and it needs a
proprietary charger it can also charge
external devices it has an auxilary in
just like that JBL but the JBL is also
completely waterproof while this is only
splash proof still i think both have a
nice design it it feels great and looks
great i really like how the drivers are
visible here but I think the JBL is the
more rugged device because of this
finish it will never scratch or
something while I could imagine the Sony
to become well some to get some
scratches here or there
also this grill I mean it it feels
strong but it could be dented with some
object I don't know so regarding sound
it's a bit difficult because the Sony
applies lots of these P process and
dynamic sound adjustment at law
was it boost base at high levels it
reduces base and adds compression while
the JBL is much more true to the
original signal it doesn't apply that
much processing simply the higher you
turn it the the lower the base gets but
you don't get that much compression so
at half levels in the back you will
still get all the punch while with the
sony you are already losing dynamics at
half volume of course I tried measuring
both and if we have a look at the
responses the JBL in black the sun in
green you can see that at a normal level
both measure pretty similar both have
some treble roll-off and the bass which
is nicely deep but at low levels you can
see that the Sony boosts bass quite a
lot which gets reduced at higher levels
so compared to the JBL the bass starts
disappearing at levels above half like I
mentioned also beware of the extra bass
button because this as we can see here
boosts the area around 200 Hertz which
makes the sound quite Bumi but it
doesn't necessarily give you better bass
also treble you get some treble boost
with extra bass which is not bad as the
sony sounds a little bit wheeled at low
levels i will try to demonstrate you
this therefore i selected a track from
sol persona and we will start listening
at a very low level or so we can hear
how the sound changes if we increase
volume I'm starting with the JBL charge
3 first
person√Æ it has small base but appears
also much more muffled I mean this is a
level you would use in an office maybe
for background listening I will start
increasing volume JBL as well the JBL
always remains the same sound wise so
there is no change
while the sony starts sounding clearer
sampling
but the higher we turn the volume the
less basil we will get the JBL again
you can already hear that it has less
punch on the GPL so I will continue
increasing volume we are slightly above
our volume now the JBL as well and you
hear much more punch
maybe another track also from savasana
listen to the bass from
the facial has no impact here nothing I
will use volley again I mean the treble
is maybe slightly better on the Sony
let's try this extra based button you
get the strange droning kind of bass
I will increase volume again JBL as well
it's more balanced still more punchy I
will keep the extra bass cotton
untouched to telephone maybe not right
it's not easy matching them because the
Sun already compresses and we are
slightly above our volume but you'll
hear much more body to the sound
you
maybe something else listen to the bass
from here it's just some
I will increase volume it more on the
JBL as well be around 2/3 closer to 3/4
again on our track I prefer the treble
responsible on here but doesn't have the
franchise Virginia
let's try this
it's just some sausage of sound with no
dynamic Peaks nothing you can really
feel a driver
do something else you hear the bass from
everything it sounds silly
overprocess
correct look how nice the JBL lend us
this deep bass no distortion nothing
there's only you can hear it struggles a
bit it's much fuller much deeper this is
keep house while the Sony is well flat
house or something at all I will again
increase volume slightly to see what
they both do with the bass drum if they
start distorting but you can hear it
remains really restrained soon as well
becomes a betrayal the treble becomes
dominant okay I will put them far away
and we will have a listen at higher
levels this position should increase
bass for both so let's have a listen
there are some notches below maximum No
it simply has small punch the jiggling
let's try it without rec some just fun
you can hear all the Sony tries to
compress all the dynamics the bass is
still there but the pigs are I runned
away I will increase both to maximum
this mixing
the Sony appears louder but you've heard
that yeah this was quite a bit of a mess
dynamic mess let's try another track
some rock
both at maximum
maybe something from nocopyrightsounds
you can hear that at maximum they become
see like n with the sony sony brighter
but the bass and compression yeah they
meet at this level somehow with the sony
maybe depending on tracks are being
slightly louder
JBL again although the JBL still has
more fun electric
you
yeah I hear less compression from the
JPL the Sony compresses more and is
slightly louder as well let's try to be
enough
you
they both keep nice bass at maximum
let's listen to another track I will use
Morgan slightly the G BLS well as long
as you don't play both at maximum the
JDL simply has more punch
get something else you can hear that
slightly below maximum that Sony think
Lee has no dynamics at all I will
increase volume again to maximum you can
hear that JBL also losing bass so at
maximum they start sounding similar
but much to see much more compression on
the zoning listen to the open hi-hat
it's not that loud in reality another
thing worth mentioning is directivity of
both because while the sony may appear
to have better treble on axis it loses
quite a bit of axis the JBL sounds a bit
more wheeled but remains more consistent
when listened from top or from the side
which i would like to demonstrate now
starting with the JBL charge 3 again
here it sounds nearer with better double
definition now I will stand up
CBO
the difference is simply much bigger
with the Sony the JBL remains simply
much more consistent although it may
appear a bit more wheeled when compared
against a speaker like that like the
Sony so I hope this was helpful a little
bit I'm really not sure and I I well
which one to prefer I thought a bit with
my own taste but I simply liked the
punch of the JBL much more if you
increase volume past half you are losing
any kind of dynamics the bass drum is
not there it makes them they even out
again so the difference is not that big
with the Sony even becoming a bit louder
but I would definitely avoid this extra
bass button at maximum it also tends to
distort much more this 200 Hertz boost
drones quite a bit and and it sounds
simply ugly without extra bass it's
better but it doesn't have this punch of
JBL so this was it now I cannot really
say anything more I really wanted to
love the Sony but yeah it didn't quite
meet my expectations at the very end so
the Sun is definitely going back
although it's a nice speaker and I'm
sure many will love it but at low levels
when I want to use it in an office it
has some nice bass but this is if it
sounds completely muffled it you only
hear bass and and if you turn it past
half it starts sounding thin again I
don't know I think there is simply too
much processing or too much Sony DSP
magic while the JBL remains very honest
and and I really welcome the tuning now
which is much more natural than it was
before so yeah thanks for watching and
we will see us in the next video have a
nice time
