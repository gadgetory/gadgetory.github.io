of San Pio play a to again this is a
pretty decent speaker and maybe you can
remember that some time ago when it was
released I think more than one year ago
I already did the read about it and I
was really impressed until I discovered
the strange distortion issues especially
with dance tracks with bass drums and so
on
meanwhile band also released an update
for the speaker so this should fix these
problems and add also some other
features to the a tool like stereo
parameter album also app support with
the possibility to adjust its sound as I
think it's a little bit treble heavy
also bass could be a bit more controlled
and I thought we'll check out if this
update really fixes all the problems the
problems I'm talking about well we will
hear it immediately I will start a track
a kind of dance track idle at low levels
like this although it shows close to
half volume yeah it's still pretty
pretty soft but as soon as you go past
half while still being soft
well the bass drum starts to sound funny
well heaven listen
it's already know this goes away if you
lower volume but always with this kind
of bass drums you have this problem now
it's okay but
oh well doesn't sound that good so with
dance tracks and so on you really
couldn't use this speaker without well
without making it sound funny I probably
will try this update together um I have
already downloaded the software the only
thing we need is some some mini USB
cable and let's check it out here select
our product we have the pure play a tool
plus this one be a download
yeah they see in the movie let's try
this make sure that your a2 is switched
off and fully charged okay well switch
it off
bring your mini USB cable remove the
grille of your a2 but be careful start
in the corner where the B&amp;amp;O logo is
located okay slowly along the edges like
this now connect your mini USB cable to
your a2 and your computer wait a minute
I'm not ready power and the software
update process I think she said first
here when the update is done as
indicated on your computer carefully
replace the grille back on your a - okay
no what was it a power and plus button
until it flashes or something Yuda it
does nothing
I know so I'll continue
yeah this can take a few minutes but at
least it's faster than on the JBL
extreme doing the update through JBL
connected to takes really half an hour
or something and you cannot stop the app
or well close connection otherwise you
will brick maybe your speaker but as you
can see there is some progress already
we have 39 40 percent so yeah it looks
as if everything was working fine here
I'm really curious how much the sound
has changed and also what kind of sound
adjustments you will get through the
pure play app 77
70 80 82 yeah it's pretty quick I'm
still a bit sick you can hear it maybe
have some cold or something all alone
ready all in one week so sorry for my
nose but it's running like a like a like
a water 99% and it got stuck okay okay
now it's done it's running like the
software version can disconnect the
cable and start using the product again
yeah we will do this how was the grill
mounted I think
yeah we don't need the computer anymore
I'm curious if it still recognizes my my
iPhone or if I have to pair again at
this grill
okay I think no it's it's on not yet
here it snapped in here it's still a bit
loose so okay now we have it let's turn
it on and see what happens and I also
have dieppe already installed yet
connected so it still Ramallah
remembers my device and let's listen
again to the same song it's at this is
better now
no pow-pow-pow effect anymore let's try
this track
yeah although you can hear it very
slightly but it's better it's definitely
better now let's try the app here it is
it started
how will you have my outfit
so what can we do now
yeah pair with another one okay that's
all I thought there were some equalizer
settings or something ah here it is well
at post space
or office you also hit the slider here
which you can move around let's see
I hope you can see we have relaxed right
excited and warm warm yet increases pace
a lot so what's your changes when I set
the slider to the upload button
but left/right increases travel or
increases bass so I think you can
definitely change the sound a little bit
to your liking for example take a bit
away of treble I think it's better now
yeah nice pickup for sure
this it should have been like that from
the very beginning so yeah I think
coming up next we will do some
comparisons against for example the FIFA
Helsinki yeah both from Denmark by the
way so it will be an interesting
comparison for sure both really high
quality brands I mean Benin dolphin and
FIFA it's really high-end company for
unknown for the best world's best
speaker drivers they are the FIFA is I
think for more than 80 years they have
to building drivers building into really
popular speakers and now they have their
own wireless pickup rent or like this
Helsinki the Copenhagen and the what's
the third one
Copenhagen is the middle one and the
largest is I don't know but anyhow yeah
the update as you can see worked it
improved the issues with the distortion
I complained about from the very
beginning so been dolls at least listens
a little bit to their customers and now
you also have the possibility to to
adjust the sound a bit to your liking
which is really nice so the pure play a
2 gained a lot thanks to this update and
have to applaud Mendelssohn for this
yeah but coming up next we will compare
these two so stay tuned for more I hope
so far this could help you a little bit
yeah and what we hear what we hear here
is this lizard hill he's always I don't
know he wants to eat something maybe
it's cream cheese on a glass so if you
if you wonder what the strange noises in
the background so
thanks for watching have a nice time and
see you in the next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
