try out something really different many
people are always complaining that some
speakers don't support a px they say
Apotex on so much better but the speaker
is not supported so I won't buy it well
I would really like to know if this
makes any difference
usually I'm streaming from an iPhone 6
which does not support depth X but I
also have a Sony NW set a 15 here which
supports a px
I thought we will string from both
devices to a higher quality speaker this
is the FIFA Helsinki which calls for 400
euros and it should reveal any
differences depending if you are
listening to some low quality mp3 chunk
or to some uncompressed file I will be
using to recording so on really
uncompressed WAV file and another one
mp3 compressed with v tool which means
192 kilobits and we will have a listen
if this really makes any difference
instead of doing life switching where
you will get the pause and so on I will
record both devices one after the other
and to the switching in post-processing
so you should really hear any difference
if there is any so I will be also
recording with highest possible quality
with 96 kilohertz and 24 bits so you
really should get the highest possible
quality which my microphones can record
so put up your headphones as this is a
binaural recording and please have a
listen and tell me afterwards if you
heard anything or if both sounded the
same for you let's have a listen
you try to get over can't be waiting now
you wanna do a word you say let's try it
again but I believe if I heard you in
the flesh
turn out to be true winner I started to
just so cruel how do me warning in one
you already put more than time
I just can't do it again
I just can't do it again I loved you
home though you came to me broken who's
your piece is in my mind and saw you add
your bones
you broke me down easy just to treat my
loving me inside my fantasies come to me
you are in my fault I never stray from
the heart of you
you can't be
we can't be
we can be
I wanna feel okay so I would really like
to know if you could hear any difference
between a px or not to tell the truth I
didn't hear anything I even think that
this FX is a bit overrated when student
from an iPhone you get equal quality I'm
not sure what Apple is using if they are
using the standard SBC codec or AAC but
you would probably need even more high
quality speakers which might reveal any
differences maybe four eight nine
hundred or thousand dollars but a usual
Bluetooth speaker 450 or two hundred
dollars with a px is simply overkill it
you won't hear anything it cuts off
usually after 14 kilohertz
they don't use any Twitter's or
something just simple full range drivers
which are not able to reveal such
details so I hope this video could give
you some insight into aptX or not I
always thought that this is a little bit
overrated as I am satisfied with the
quality I'm getting from an iPhone or
maybe with Android it's different
Android without a px might maybe have
worse quality I'm not sure but I never
had any problems with with Apple devices
so I'm really satisfied what I'm getting
even without ethics so I hope this video
was helpful for you and we'll see us in
the next one have a nice time and bye
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
