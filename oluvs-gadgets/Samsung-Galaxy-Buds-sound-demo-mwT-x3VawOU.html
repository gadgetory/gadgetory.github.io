due to all the hype and also because of
the high amount of requests by you to
review the Samsung Galaxy bats I ordered
a pair as I was curious by myself to
hear how they sound if they are really
that great how many claim if they
deserve all this hype so here they are
140 150 euros not that cheap but still
cheaper than the Apple earpods which
cost a few hundred seventeen hundred
eighty I only have the normal Apple
earpods
which I personally find really crappy
the airports do not sound that much
different so let's see what Samsung came
up with tuned was sound by AKG we
already had the Samsung s8 bundle also
tuned by EKG so my hope was that it
would be really decent unfortunately
like the airports are adamant for iOS
users only and they don't work with
Android devices the Galaxy buds are only
for Android users you can still use them
with an iPhone but you lose many
features so the recent equalizer through
an app which is only web on Android so
you don't have the option for additional
tunings to an iOS device or so you
cannot configure the the touch pads and
so on and so on but let's look inside
packaging is quite app like wide yeah I
ordered them in white I think they look
a little bit gay like this if I knew
like this sound this is a little bit
it's not white but has this bluish
shimmering here nicely small nicely
light this this charging box box is
quite nice you can see the remaining
battery life if you just open it with
the but inside they jump into pairing
mode and now they should be already
connected to my android phone here they
come with different tips also with these
logs let's call them logs so to put them
in because otherwise they won't stay you
have to turn them slightly like this and
then they should be fixed I think yeah
they have not that uncomfortable so I
think they're quite nice I use the
biggest tips also tried other tips but
like this you can see it looks okay
overall white is a little bit gauge mini
for a girl it would be nicer and you
have these touch control so tapping ones
start me
Oh stops music double typing jumps to
the next track but you can configure
this to Dieppe unfortunately not
available on the iPhone there is also an
option for ambient sound so you have a
microphone and it feeds the ambient
noise into into the buds here what else
do we have notifications you can find my
earbuds I haven't tried it because yeah
I'm an iOS user so for me they have not
that great because with the standard
tuning
so with equalizer of the sound not that
great with a little I mean they don't
sound horrible
like the bandar-log symbiote play it did
which sounded really completely off
especially for twice the price three
hundred dollars with connectivity
problems I noticed that these also have
some slight connectivity issues
yesterday there was some update so I
performed their favor update but when I
drove my scooter with with them inside
here my iPhone inside my pocket I turned
the head around I got some dropouts
so maybe the update fixed it I didn't
try because I didn't use them that much
I simply don't like this sound at all as
mentioned it's not that bad but it's not
really great either mmm so it's a rather
flat tuning with bass and everything
needs but rebel has some issues and I
would like to demonstrate you this so I
will put it inside here it will simply
have a listen and I said don't have
anything comparable for this price let's
compare it again against my Sony mhm 1
which is modded to bring bass to a
normal level you can see I sealed it
here with hot glue because I think the
Sony sounds considerably nicer smoother
mmm
it has some travel issues and I would
like to show you this always keep my
samples with some reservation don't take
them too seriously if you listen to them
you will probably hear something
different
I rather tuned them for from my own ears
so how I would hear them
you should hear mmm this tuning quite
well from the recording so I will play
analog from so Poisson process freedom
and at the beginning here the original
track just for reference so you know how
it should sound then I will play it with
neutral EQ and then I will switch to
this dynamic EQ there are other settings
like soft bass boost clear treble boost
but they don't sound that great either
I think dynamic is the most common one
which was used by I read some reviews or
everyone was raving about this dynamic
EQ the biggest problem is that the EQ is
not saved within the earphone it is
saved if you use the same form but when
I switch the EQ to dynamic and then I
would like to hear over my iPhone it
will play again without EQ with this
default tuning which is of course a pity
I tried it reconnecting again to my
android phone and it started with
neutral tuning and then after some
seconds it jumped over to dynamic so
obviously it remembers which phone you
were playing from so from an iOS device
there is no way to make them sound
different therefore the main comparison
will be made with the standard default
tuning just to let you know and how they
sound with this dynamic EQ I recorded in
I recorded it like this as well so let's
have a listen
I think you'd hear the whole tuning is
actually not that bad a little bit thin
and harsh at the same time this improves
when said to this dynamic EQ unfortunate
with an iOS or any other non Android
device there's no way to set any of
these issues so now let's compare them
directly to the Sony image one yeah my
modded one I will play it with this
default stock tuning which is a bit too
thin and too sizzling for my taste but
it's the way how it would sound over an
iPhone I will play my standard three
tracks at the beginning and at the end
you will always hear the audio track for
reference and in between our switch
between the galaxy parts and the solemn
so literally
is it just a treat my loving inside my
fantasy call to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you
am i searching you I wanna feel
Hey
so in my opinion the sony is a waste
with a something in here it's not
violence doesn't have all these great
features but just on sound alone and not
that impressed with the galaxy but
especially not with this standard
default tuning it sounds a live it
better with dynamic but for me there is
no way to set it to dynamic permanently
maybe let's a look at some measurements
to see what's going on here in blue you
can see the default tuning and in red
the dynamic EQ just for reference I will
overlay the modded Sony image one here
in black and you can see that the
default tuning has pretty flat base
maybe even less based on the Hammond
target so the modded Sony image one has
only more here around 5 dB
if I only the unmod it original sunny
image 1 you can see that it's around
1012 DB more dynamic EQ improves the
celibates all raises bass to a higher
level but there is still some drop below
50 Hertz apart from that I think the
Galaxy buds are quite close to the
Hammond target except this 6 7 kilo has
boost you can see the Sony is way
smoother here and overall travel is more
boosted on the galaxy but therefore yeah
I'm not really that impressed I mean
they sound ok way better than the pure
play 8 which sounded just horrible
but you cannot get rid of this 6-7
kilohertz boost here also with the
default tuning which is how I would
listen to them from an iPhone they sound
too thin if you use them in noisy
environment
you only hear treble and harshness so
they are not that great I definitely
prefer the Sony the moderate even the
original one way more I also think that
the Samsung s8 band well also tuned by
AKG sounds better than this it's not OLS
but you can get it for 8 9 euros and
hope to get a genuine one so 450 dollars
or euros I mean you can find much better
sounding ones they are quite comfortable
but they are nothing special so I will
definitely return them because they are
not for me and as I don't use Android
hey I cannot use them I would probably
also use them with this dynamic EQ or
some other one I tried them all but I
found an emic to
sound maybe best still I would have
liked that they reduce this area around
selling kilohertz it's not as pronounced
as on many other try five in years but
it's definitely pronounced and it's what
puts it off I mean it's not that close
to for any harm on target or any natural
you could hear it from the recording
it's not really close to the original
sound so here the Sony is definitely
closer yeah my take on the Galaxy birds
they are not horrible but definitely
nothing to hyper be raving about and
coming up next I would like to make a
comparison of the Sony image one against
the Sony I have some here so against the
Sony image one see the Sony MH 750 and
the Sony image 755 so they are all here
so stay tuned
but the galaxy but definitely not my
thing
they are nice comfortable but I mean you
are better off with the Sony MH 7 of 755
and some Bluetooth receiver from Sony
which you can get also 440 fifty dollars
so way cheaper than these you still have
some higher but also sound wise way
nicer so I hope this was helpful to give
you an idea about the sound of the
galaxy but definitely only for Android
users if you own a iOS device or some
other non Android device where you
cannot install this galaxy wearable app
yes stay stay away from them because
they sound too thin and - sizzling - too
harsh if there was at least some EQ some
parametric EQ like we had on the
Jaybirds
which you can read in the sound to some
reference level this is not possible
with these therefore I am NOT impressed
and although designed everything is
great
I think they are not that great overall
yeah thanks for watching and see in the
next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
