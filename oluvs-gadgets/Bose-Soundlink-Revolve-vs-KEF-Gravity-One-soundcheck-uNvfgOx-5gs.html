to compare they both something evolved
against a cave gravity one we've already
heard this before and I think this is
quite a fair comparison it's both our
mole is the same size maybe even with
the cave being slightly larger botha
omnidirectional and both are mono but
the cave cost nearly twice the price of
the boss then I'm getting lots of
comments about the post to be completely
overpriced
to expensive well I'll kick this rally
known for their high-end stuff so their
LS 50-knot speakers are top-notch and
you would also expect great performance
out of a portable speaker that cost
three hundred eighty dollars both on the
other hand is rather laughed at with B
OSE and by other sound equipment so I
thought we should check it out how they
sound compared as always I will be using
a head cam and binaural microphones
therefore you should listen to
headphones for best results please put
them up and let's check them out let's
turn them on the cave plays some cheesy
work on phones and it also needs some
second to connect the Bose connects
immediately and I will start playing
with the Bose Soundlink revolve and a
classical track from johannes brahms so
please have a listen
maybe some chairs
or just fun let's call it R&amp;amp;B or New
Groove new soul whatever and although
all the help lens needs to be F
directional or omnidirectional speaker
it's really unique you driver here
shoots became perfectly abolitionist
results before you do this with their
bows this is really small as a sound
sphere around the speaker but because of
this the sound also changes quite a lot
if I place it on a flat surface so it
would sound better I think if it if it's
hanging somewhere
still I think it sounds quite a bit
better and more mature than the cap this
sounds really quite cheap trick
yeah usually I would immediately jump to
the next song but let's wait until the
drum and bass part comes in we are all
ready now the difference is quite
obvious
but let's listen all
yeah I mean
that's our something else something more
acoustic maybe
here not that bad but makes really some
definitions
some clarity maybe maybe they check them
more from above they think it's a little
bit better but still so I wouldn't have
designed it as a non-directional
speakers it really loses quite a bit
when listened to in such a way
something else
I mean I leaned back again
I've also here can carry those hips
and more convincing experience
really becomes better from the bath
some other pick some hip-hop maybe jazzy
dance track and I will increase volume
slightly on the morality one as well
and maybe let's walk around again we
hear how they perform of axes and how
they manage to fill the room with music
here
the prosthetic appears private polar
do something else and I would increase
volume for mixing on that post
on the gravity on this well this is
quite a difference and although most
compresses quite a bit the calf becomes
really lost there
I'll see didn't help to come closer
listen to Madonna maybe some other dance
track something more electro
this is such a fraidy one playing at
maximum force as well you can hear maybe
that it swallows the place from a little
bit but if I reduce volume two notches
it's still louder than the heaven this
sounds really a bitch you traitor like
I wouldn't say that they're both solving
the wolf is the best portable speaker
I've ever heard but I think it does the
job pretty well with its great 360
degree sound dispersion as the sound
hardly changes when you turn it around
I think the receiving some real advanced
know-how inside the acoustic deflector
seems to be pretty complex I think it
has two levels for separating
frequencies and it just a simple 4 into
driver so quite impressive what Bose has
achieved with this the curve from the
other end with their high-end unique you
driver is rather disappointing
especially if you really want 360-degree
sound it sounds better when aimed
directly at the listener but even then
it's rather average so if you keep in
mind that this cost three hundred eighty
dollars and this 199 I think that Bose
is quite a bit more impressive still
there are people who seem to be
impressed by the cave there is one
reviewer on Amazon who says excellent
sound for such a small speaker better
than similarly priced because yeah $380
you can already get a FIFA Helsinki
which wipes both of them I hope this
little comparison could put this into
some yeah better relation though I don't
really think that Bose is overpriced
it's definitely not cheap but better
than many others similarly or higher
price because than this it's really
quite impressive and yeah enjoying yeah
I hope you liked this little bit thanks
for watching and see you in the next
video have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
