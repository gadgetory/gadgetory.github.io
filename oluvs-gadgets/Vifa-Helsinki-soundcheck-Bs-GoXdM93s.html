present you a speaker that really
surprised me a lot this is the FIFA
Helsinki FIFA is a Dutch company and
like many other scandinavian companies
they seem to have some fable for fabric
covers so this might look maybe like
some woman's handbag you know it a
speaker that you carry around and play
soft music some folks some soft rock but
well in reality this is really heavy
stuff I would maybe try to compare it
against the band all of some pure play a
two or the Bowers and Wilkins d7 but
this is much more serious this is what I
would call maybe a boom box for hyphy
enthusiasts so I thought we will compare
it against the real boom box the JBL
extreme but as you can see the JBL
extreme is a much larger speaker it's
heavier this is really a fraction of the
size of the JBL but it reaches nearly
the same loudness without any distortion
without compression without funky bass
reduction and so on
so yeah let's try how it sounds against
the JBL as always i below a B of course
using my binaural microphones I'll be
using my head cam so please put up your
headphones for best results and yeah we
will have a short lesson as you can see
I placed them far away this time as they
are simply able to play much louder and
fill the room better with some than all
those small speakers I will be starting
with a track from sole persona and peppy
for Helsinki first
yeah I think you could hear that the
FIFA has a more natural sound not as
booming as the JBL while still packing
this punch with deeper bass and so on
let's listen to another track you can
hear the bass punch it better
I will start increasing volume to
maximum with this maximum volume address
by sinking off jbls well maximum
you
maybe another house track still Babu me
but flower the place has not no equality
it's impressive
no distortion clean let's find out
all right sounds friend here volume
starting coupe trilogy
watch more
mini disco
some love me
vo
now I thought we should listen how the
FIFA Helsinki sounds at lower levels for
example compared against the reverse
which of course cannot play as loud but
let's see how both sound at what I would
call more normal listening levels the
FIFA Helsinki again first
I will reduce volume slightly on both
and you can maybe notice that the fever
becomes thinner sounding while the
reverse becomes better sounding let's
listen to another FAQ
you
or something from some person again
and I would use volume again slightly
you know to simulate really low-level
listening
and I think it's noticeable what I
wanted to show you the lower the volume
the less impressive the sound becomes of
their FIFA Helsinki
okay so what's the reason for this
rather funny result as most other
portables because tend to sound great at
low levels but as soon as you crank them
past half they start to apply some funky
kind of dynamic compression and distort
anyhow the FIFA Helsinki on the other
hand seems to sound best at levels close
to maximum but at low levels it sounds a
little bit tinny maybe if we have a look
at the frequency response measurement
this might explain a little bit and as
you can see it has a rather flat and
natural frequency response without any
artificial boost and with some nice base
extension below 50 Hertz but you can
also see that the bass rolls off
slightly compared to the mids also if
looking at the measurement at maximum
and then low levels you see that the
sound remains always the same so the
problem is rather the human ear here
which simply becomes less sensitive to
low frequencies at low levels and fever
does not compensate for this unlike for
example Bose which boosts bass a lot at
low levels there's Soundlink mini sounds
full-bodied and heavy at low levels but
as soon as you turn volume up bass gets
reduced again and yet disappears and the
speaker sounds funny I got an email from
Viva and they told me that there will be
an app which will allow the user to
select different voicings there will
also be some kind of night mode which
acts probably a little bit like loudness
compensation they also told me that
there will be maybe some user adjustable
equalizer but in its current status I'm
not that impressed for low level
listenings still it's one of the most
impressive because I've tried until now
as it simply shows how much you can push
physical limits with loudness and bass
in a small form-factor like this I mean
having again look at the JBL extreme
this is much smaller but takes more
punch less Distortion deeper bass so
it's impressive what fever has achieved
here they really have some impressive no
how about speaker design driver design
and yeah I would recommend any hyphy
enthusiasts to have a listen to the
speaker as it's what I would call a
boombox for real
- ethics I hope this would could give
you a first impression about the FIFA I
really like to speak a lot but I hope it
will be improved and they will keep the
promise with this app and loudness
compensation because you need to crank
it close to maximum to get the best
sound of sound out of it so yeah I hope
you liked it and we will see us in the
next video have a nice time and bye bye
is - this pink ecstatic yeah Claire
Claire benefit Achmat a no naka per
