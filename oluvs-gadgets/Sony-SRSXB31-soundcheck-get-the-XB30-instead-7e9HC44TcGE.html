finally time to check out the new Sony
SRX xB 31 a bit more in detail it's
quite a hyped and raved speaker I'm not
sure why but I'm getting really lots of
comments when do you finally review the
xB 31 and 41 I only heard the 41 in the
store yeah he also had it together with
me my recent video and I thought it's
horrible I turned it off immediately
I thought the xB 31 easily be better but
if you know the evolution of the xB 3 to
the X B 30 and now they're 31 you will
notice that it's rather a step backwards
especially sound wise it gains some nice
features like this one here for example
completely useless
it hasn't worked that well so I'm not
sure who would really use this also the
new LED strip here I don't like it that
much I would turn it off in public if I
really wanted to use the speaker only
nice feature is that it's completely
waterproof now the xp3 wasn't but how
often do you really put a speaker
underwater I mean it's great if it's
less water-resistant like oh these are
the 10 it's also completely waterproof
but it doesn't float on water so it's
drones and then I'm not sure so the most
important part is sound for me and this
is where the XP 31 rather disappoints
you can already check it out from my
database for all those who don't know it
it's a recording database with all
speakers I had at home so more than 200
speakers you can compare it against any
other speaker in this in the same price
range or a cheaper one a larger one
whatever but now I would like to
demonstrate you the sound in a kind of
live video I'm wearing binaural
microphones so you should listen with
headphones and we will compare it first
maybe against a top contender in this
class the Denon environment is more less
currently I think hundred 70 euros the
original price of this one is also
hundred seventy so please listen
headphones and I start with a song from
so Poisson process freedom and the Sony
playing first
some settings are default so it comes
like this out of the box
then on
yes you can get a difference
yeah I think it's time to start the Sony
they call it music center now family was
called the song power thing and every
time I switch it will need to reconnect
to the speaker which is also a little
bit offered so this is the standard mode
which is extra bass enabled you can try
standard it sound any better as the bass
is not as muddy anymore but compared to
the denim it simply will sound that very
thing so you can see here the F is also
let me try to enter again here a new
mode is live sound which enhances the
stereo image
listen to the result I think it's
completely overdone not a big fake
treble becomes out of phase slightly so
it sounds like some cheap mp3
again again also some stir enhancing but
way more natural not to such a degree
where the meats also their ego becomes
pronounced I still have the any seven
anything we could try is adding a bit of
treble boost the volume here is that
unlike the XP 30 we're boosting treble
booster trailer upper travel gear you
will only goes lower treble somewhere is
it we have again the street and equal
equalizer so you get lots of presents
boost doesn't sound that great I will
leave it maybe like this again
right it is a bit softer compared
that's the also way more dynamic list
for district listen hi swallows their
tax of the base rum then way more than
anywhere way more punchy so I'll
increase volume is more and the Sun it
becomes three-man compressed
and also somehow they stole their
perfect
so this year the trace from his smokey
cat all
I can increase volume and the Sun
remains still a normal white at low
levels the tenant sounds normal
the sonne on the other hand will will
suddenly become Bhoomi for low levels so
you would need to again like on the xp3
read turn off this extra base for low
levels turn it on for high levels but
you don't have any button anymore you
have to keep prayers - with play pressed
for 3 seconds yeah I'm not sure why they
had to save for a simple button and also
there is no way to switch to live sound
without it but let us enter at higher
levels check out how the Sony will
reduce basement more despite extra base
it's not listenable egg this compressed
mess by the denim Sun it's not as large
but still normal
is making over persons
I'm not sure this will sound great
outdoors
sadly they cannot appear smadi although
people claim it to have
let's compare it against the XP 30 I
will revert back to default settings and
let's have a listen to these the XP 30
will be playing with my suggested
settings which is bass and treble at
maximum and extra bass disabled below
our volume and enabled above half right
now we are above half so extra bases on
why the XP 31 will be playing with its
default settings which is also extra
bass enabled let's try another song
expert area
and I think you're here it still sounds
simply subpar and it's not easy you can
see VF is just hopeless I will try it
they connect to the experience that so
we cannot be run anything okay try the
expectation you can hear it sounds way
better let me try the app again I'm not
even able to post read an hour do
something that's perfect
as I listen here that based on his way
more effective way more dynamic compared
to their x2 31 there is some limit
nervously way stronger than its on the
XP 30 more similar to the xp3 mating
Madison analog from sufficient princess
future
let me try and yet again I have to come
Wi-Fi hotels mates come on now hopefully
so maybe we can boost treble any bit you
can see that it is just and you will
notice that listing travel doesn't to
stop arrivals or rather the presence
region and let's also boost base just
like on there if you thirty maybe it
will get some more cake so here it
starts to distort already this Phil
doesn't have the strong presence but
Wayne Isis Martin
classes on trade let's write this wreck
and it's increased volume on not also
place cleaner that experien already get
some information to hear this I mean
we've boosted based on maximum to make
it comparable and it starts to distort
is this one more a fairy
yeah I will already get so let's write
this right
this is behind history I'm still not oh
that's still it's usable there's time
I'm decorating a month you can try lower
levels of course now I will turn off
extra base to make it sound normal so
here you would have to keep the space
price at low levels maybe it becomes a
little more open sounding maybe they
start to adjust treble for low levels
which they didn't with the XPS 13 130
sorry so I will enable extra base again
as at high levels it will those base way
too much
so there should be extra base and maybe
a heart wreck and let's listen what
happens we are around half now
we call here
is that term extra based on the
expectation No
so it could have played even let's try
the game maximum one
and now you can hear a difference
as if it was strong in quite a lot I
would like to hear the other song again
because I didn't play it with extra base
but the XP fairly definitely needs extra
base about a volume so you can hear it
remains quite punchy maybe the
difference is not huge but it's
definitely noticeable so you can hear
some differences only thing we could try
is this live mode how both sounds as the
XP that it doesn't have live mode if
compared like this without live modes
the XP ferry wins easily at low levels
it sounds nicer not as booming let me
try I hope the app will let me again no
yeah it's really me now many settings
missing let me try again maybe play the
song in the background so that did yeah
this is a piece really strange and now
it tries to connect to that XP 30 again
it doesn't see the experience so let me
turn off this here
it's still unvisible invisible so Sonia
come on here it is finally
so if you want to switch to life mode or
switch between all these modes it's
really a hassle you can see it doesn't
work at all what a bleedin finish line
which means no connection or connection
failed come on you can see so I will
turn off this one as well and we'll try
from scratch as I want to show you both
with life mode enabled for the expiry
one so but now it should be right
yeah here it oh no finally so let's
enable live mode I'm not sure if there
is some button combination that you can
enable life not without app but I don't
think so
we have still treble and bass at maximum
I would reduce travel maybe some notice
because with life mode it already gets
some more presence I will turn the xB 30
as well and what we have here yeah let's
try a track from so personam princess we
try again
here is from the you here what happens
we are on high volume now
it is life mode swallows dynamics
completely lost any effect from the face
doesn't have this on stage but not speak
to me wait for my time boost
so way more dynamic somehow more days
it's like this also from sort of
countries really listening justice
dominate next be ferry if you hear how I
started to adjust the place immediately
there is some slight email with so nice
because they always either the base
comes back afterwards on hours away at
Maui ferry place clean I will increase
wanna many more
no it's this will turn off this now it's
not is this turned off again yes they
have some problem if it's a ton of
accessories so we can compare them at
rather normal levels here missing some
spots I mean the sausage is nice but it
also sounds fake somehow and this
distortion at low levels of course this
sounds boring an original
this one is
please change the circuit when I'm with
my head so let's increase let's turn on
extra base again let's try them at
maximum this is the XP fairy
someplace happiness
also mixing
they're way more than any four days
not anymore
we've been here
I was a difficulty father
that is my respect we know we can hear
how the limit of pushes wall around
yeah I mean I was impressed with the
it's been 30 because again I was
impressed with the XP 30 because the
potential is there there is some nice
stuff rebels parking it meets some app
yes some help from the app but at least
with this extra base trick you can bring
it to yet a usable level well here you
don't have any buttons anymore
and even with some trail boosts you
still miss this part so just on sound
alone this is a disappointment also
could hear there was some distortion
with this life sound mode it loses
dynamic compared to the XP ferry which
already tricks quite a lot when
comparing it against the Denon which we
did they explicitly there are some
strange compression tricks as well but
not to such a degree like the XP 31 of
course I measured it and you can see
different volume levels without extra
bass in black and with extra bass in red
so you can see without extra bass at low
level stories tool in bass while it
handles it loses bass too much the same
effect we had on the XP 30 with extra
base that is way too much bass for low
levels while at high levels it manages
to retain more bass but you can also see
some treble deep above 7 kilo Hertz and
above 10 kilo as there is not that much
if I overlay the xp3 here with my
suggested settings again treble and bass
at maximum with extra bass enabled you
can see that there is also some slight
dip which makes it appear maybe slightly
muddy but it doesn't have this presence
boost and also much better upper travel
so yeah overall yeah by the XP theory if
you are really interested in this by
even 2 of them I cut this for 70 euros
this is hundred 70 so I could get two
for the price of one I can I can play
them in stereo they have better sound
without this stupid party boosters I
don't know
so for me it's a huge disappointment
it's it should be an advanced and how do
you say in English advancement I don't
know it should be some development but
we are yet it seems to develop back the
Sun is horrible you always again have to
change modes depending on your level
I need a speaker like the Denon which
sounds great at low level sounds great
at high levels I do not need to turn
any extra bases and not sure why they
did this I mean the speaker has this
potential it just needs some more
reasonable tuning without stupid button
presses I don't know why you have to
increase treble from inside the app if
it can play the straddle but why do you
have to adjust it before or why do you
have it to adjust it by your own it
should have this tuning from from stock
or yes Sony please please give us a
speaker which is really decent this is
complete crap waste of money
the extra 30 was already decent it had
the potential but thisis maybe because
of the material which now swallows up a
treble but then ya do something against
it not simply use the same drivers but
make better travel so that it can come
through yeah I'm a little bit frustrated
also not that I had hopes for this but
because yeah they are developing back
then like we've seen with the JBL what
was this the go to which is the same
speaker three years afterwards the same
sound just more expensive then on also
his issues they have some self
discharging some he said at low level so
I think we are still not there therefore
I hope this was helpful for you to give
you an impression about the XP 31 mm if
you don't want to hear me talking check
it out on my database Capri compared
against the XP 31 I have recorded it
with three settings on with its normal
mode without extra bass with extra bass
and with my suggested settings I think
with my suggested settings it sounds
really decent but it doesn't have this
life sound the life sound here is also
completely over exaggerated so it's
overdone it floats around and the mids
are pushed way too much the down does it
really well it has some story enhancing
built in but not to such a strongly
agreed just here helps to improve the
sound make it a little bit more open I
would have wished maybe some life sounds
not on there xp3 but no to such a degree
and I don't need these materials this
was already great-looking I think just a
ton of lights and it's yeah it's nice
yeah I hope you like this anyhow and not
a Sony friend I am NOT a demand for
member and not a fanboy of anything
anything I just want decent speakers
and yeah let's listen to some really
decent ones which I just got recently
there the audio Pro p20 which are really
nice so thanks for watching I hope I
didn't waste your time but now let's
listen to some really great music
way more punch way more dynamic somehow
I managed somehow with the drake suffer
she senescu and trained for she's an
epic so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
