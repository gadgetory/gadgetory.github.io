veggies and s3 parts because steljis is
a British company they go from 200
pounds and they equipped with Bluetooth
optical in they also go for odd I set
them up like this and we're gonna have a
listen I offer you the best and most
immersive 3d sonic spirits just be sure
to listen with a decent pair of
headphones this is a binaural recording
neutral neutral button which sets
everything back to normal
it's increasing
I set myself behind you here today to
the right side
I think they sound really nice mic
neutral
yeah
that's for this
Thank You central so you get the best
zone
you take some very nice
my
I was they have now kind of the oddness
compensation for low-level stay still
son reunited Laureles if the Saudis -
you can always be space some watches so
we are it mixing now with base and I
think for the layers it sounds quite
nice like this as well so you can see
there are four steps up and down for
base the same
significant to the pack of huge
but see you say bass reflex system
depending on their loudness level also
on the bass level but
the clothes are here maybe we can also
compare them against the FIFA Oslo yet
it's an apples and oranges comparison as
the FIFA is the portable speakers or
other mono but price-wise
yeah it's less than half the price for
the stages in the streets because and we
can also have a look at the back I set
them up closer to each other so the
difference in stereo imaging should be
that big compared to their rather
monosodium FIFA Oslo they also explain
with its new promote the stages industry
are also playing with new problem and
let's play analog from so princess
future and this stage is being first
you can also we also have track controls
here on the remote control bearing
optically it's already told you yeah it
come with a non speaker table some some
plugs and cables better they come in the
British power plant also with the roof
you'll end with an auxilary wire so
everything is included what you need is
here and here you can see this is st.
input 3.5 millimeter input subwoofer out
yeah USB is only for charging and it has
even optically I haven't tried if they
can be called DTS probably not probably
only normal wavestream yeah I think
they're really nice regarding the priced
one pounds there may be some better
alternatives I know but
as LSR 300 550 are much larger they
don't have a bluetooth don't have
optical in nor out there are some from
audio engine I'm not sure how these
sound compared to the stages maybe I
would have the chance to compare this to
I will of course also include them into
my database as soon as I manage so we
can compare them to any other speakers
like the JBL control X which really suck
but the frequency response is not that
much different I measured them and you
can see that they measure really natural
with much better treble and the JBL
control X although base is similar but
still better on the stages you can see
there is some inconsistency with bass
they have some slight hump around 75
Hertz they would have some response down
to 40 Hertz but a little bit too soft so
if increase bass one step two steps
three or four steps you can see that
lower place can be enhanced like this
but unfortunately also quite a bit more
of upper base so it would sound better
without this strong 200 Hertz boost but
with a bit more lower base still I think
as it is nowadays sound really nice and
Fortuner parts definitely recommend it
if you need some smaller not polish
because but great neutral sounding
bookshelf speakers for your desk or
something I think they do a really great
job
they are looking great also good quality
is really top-notch yeah I have no
complaints I mean these are not polished
because I'm not for Haslam she could
hear at maximum there was some slight
distortion and there were not very loud
but still I think for most situations
they should be yeah enough yeah this was
it about the stages NS free I will try
to get hold of more 2.0 speakers might
gets nothing from Toy Fair some other
ones I'm quite interested in the a lot
micro monitors there Henry treated by
DSP so really smooth paste down to 50
Hertz I think also smaller these could
be interesting to hear them as well
around 300 bucks so bit more expensive
and is
yeah yeah with some questions we had
feel free to ask</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
