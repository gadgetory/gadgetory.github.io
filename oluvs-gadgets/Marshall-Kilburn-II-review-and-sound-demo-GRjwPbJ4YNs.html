Marshalls current lineup of portable
speakers for 2019 over the Cuban who is
a little bit older the stock will - and
the Tufton a completely new I have
already reviewed the stock will - which
I liked quite a lot I also gave it my
personal award we will take a more
detailed look at the Tufton later so
today I would like to concentrate on the
Kilburn tool you can see the new
Marshall Keeble - is a complete redesign
of the old version not only externally
design wise but was internally acoustic
wise since I think Marshall try to offer
you a similar but improved sound over
the Old Kingdom I mean the old one was
quite popular so they probably didn't
want to change too much not put put of
their customers but gone is the strong
retro look you can see they redesigned
the grille here which I personally like
mono it's also more in line with the
other models but you don't get this nice
golden panel on top without this very
old-school flip button here you still
get tone controls with their own knobs
and buttons and has multi pairing
something the old one didn't have but
completely new is the acoustic design so
it consists of one woofer with one Peter
at the front and another driver at the
back so it applies the same to online
processing we already know from the
Marshall stockwell tomb but I think it
doesn't work that well for the Cuban -
so what does blond line do it doesn't
simply play the left channel to the
front and the right on to the back but
rather sums up left and right with both
being out of phase for the front and
back so they should cancel out each
other so from front you should get some
Sarah but with the Cuban if you listen
from front you rather get a mono sound
with the other channel playing for the
back it doesn't work that well like with
the stock well tomb also the stock will
to listen from the side projected the
song somehow into the room this doesn't
work with the children I did some
measurements to see what's going on I
made them Otto's at a distance from half
a meter and you can see the measurement
onyx is from front and from the back you
can see it measures a little bit weird
the tone controls are in neutral here we
can also have a look at the measurement
with the tone dials at minimum and at
maximum you can see it has too much
upper base there is a strange peak
between one and two kilohertz and
another dip at 5 kilohertz
so overall the sound is a bit strange
and I would like to demonstrate to this
I would like to go inside first and
we'll compare it maybe against the
anchors and commotions class which is
not
Mona also cheaper but I think at normal
levels it can compete quite well in even
outperform the Cuban - and we can also
compare it against the audio pro zone C
3 which is similarly priced a bit
smaller but also has Wi-Fi so it's the
the similar version to the p3 but I
think they see three sounds better also
because it offers tone control just like
the Cuban and later on we'll go out to
us because I heard some claims that it's
a loudspeaker and it's indeed quite lot
about the loudness of an Jabil extreme -
maybe but with more bass so it doesn't
reduce bass at high levels but rather
keeps based at the high level and
reduces treble instead so I thought
we'll compare it maybe against a mini
Eric 3 set up with meaner example food
this is maybe one of the hardest small
portable speakers the norm and you will
hear how loud it release and
unfortunately I cannot offer you any the
health comparison to the old Marshall
kilburn but you can check it out from my
database and you will notice that then
you want although it's rather offers
some kind of mono sound still sounds
better
so check it out from a database compare
it against the table extreme also it
makes him you will hear that the Cuban
pool has small base and more meaty sound
but also slightly more compressed but
now let's get into us and have a listen
as always I will use my DJI Osmo action
as head cam for this first-person
immersive view and sound of course using
my phone or microphones usual this and
headphones put them up and let's check
them out first let's compare the Cuban 2
against a stock well too as I think that
with this particular model online
processing really works at its best so
it offers you some additional quality of
the music why with the kilburn it's not
that great I will start with a gesture
and equipment to playing first
the Stockholm
he placed somehow more open so you have
the impression as hitting the music in
front of you why would the Kievan - it's
rather inside the speaker
it is that emotive use but also way more
spacious also in listen like this
apparently from the side
but you may be here that the office had
rather soundstage here
that's what this it add some additional
reverb effect to the music which somehow
is not wanted but you can hear it also
broadens up create some kind of sound
battle something that Hill them to
doesn't quite offer
so the processing really adds some
additional quality it also adds some
artifacts all this edit reverb but you
get some openness which is rather
missing from traditional speakers
especially when listen decals from the
side let's ride this rack it also add
some additional ambience and reverb
but this deal somehow sounds simply more
open
it's gonna get MoMA
of course at higher levels the stopper
tool will start to lose bass also become
quite a bit more compressed
here in stronger quite a bit why the
Cuban as way more power
so it's not a speaker for high levels
now let's compare the Cuban two against
an audio Pro ed on c3 the audio Pro is
playing with my personal sound settings
which is travel at maximum and pace to
notice below as I think it sounds best
like this especially at lower levels I
will start again with the Marcia and
listen closer to their Fender Rhodes
here
you can hear some buzzing sound here
the audio Pro doesn't do this
so maybe also some side artifact of this
Blum and processing
and you could see increase travel to
maximum on the c3
and I think it sounds fine like this
but we get the same with the kid on tour
to some a bit too harsh too exaggerated
so I will leave treble and bass at
neutral
the committee also here that the
Marshall Keeble - has way more emphasis
on alpha base
and it gives you this song somehow
that's why this if you can maybe hear if
you notice some well that there is only
some processing some compression going
on which is probably also some side
artifact of glam line or of the
implementation of this processing here
CP again
face yes like it was recorded more or
less also is to sum up left and right
for the Wolfram but at least trail is
spread to the left and right
naturally strike some kind of rock me
reduce pace here but this also reduces
lower days so we reduce the complete
days
we like this
snippy the Sun somehow more normal
it has some coloration which ya Sunday
night I think this work
here is again a meadow space I think
it's right now
you can have its Romano
offers a more direct sound but also some
nice effects is although the Kuban tool
does a better job maybe in spreading the
sound to the sides and
so let's compare the marshal Kibum to
against the Incas sound commotion plus
the Inca is also the option for some
kind of tone controls which I available
for the sound kept apart from some
safety recess there is also a 9/10
equalizer
I set it like this as I think it sounds
best like this the Marshall Keeble to
explain with neutral settings and again
another track from savasana increases
future
here it also adds some kind of
compression some dynamics processing
which doesn't really add any quality to
the music unlike with the Super Bowl to
get some additional artifacts but no
benefit from this the income definitely
offers a more realistic result here
is it quite gloomy and cheap I refuse
bail edges and multiplexer maybe let's
reduce if it's indeed a bit for this for
district
until the face doesn't hate this for
meanness
I'm not sure it sounds a bit red inside
the speakers also effects is Jenka does
quite a great job I think
so yeah something else
a little space again there for
next trick
maybe even better with based on time
that's our this right
thanks and excellent is
and here it's quite punchy with bass
but not as loud rate not as booming I
will increase volume to make some here
so you can also listen like hi ladies
of course the Anka is a way smaller
speaker so it cannot retain all the days
at maximum I will increase volumes the
Marshall like this menu
but the base is also quite mini Bianca
still sounds great I would say more
offensive cannot compete bonds from my
dog
howdy class it's one of the same just
with way more babies and more cooling
and now let's get autos in compare it
against the mini reeks with me lyrics up
to hear how loud it really is a turn
treble to eight on the Marshall
otherwise it tends to sound a bit muddy
at high levels I also set a custom EQ
for the mini rigs and let's start with
the first track in the master playing
first volume is around two thirds
Horrocks
I was talking quizzing volume to maximum
so this is the macho thing at maximum
Aminu makes the loudest ice quality
fries
what we could try is placing the sofa on
the floor which should increase based
slightly this purpose you will rather be
Houston like this on the floor so let's
try the game increasing form to maximum
of the Marshall
damn away maybe ten meters but it's
quite soft already gemiini rigs let me
try to reduce volume to the same level
as their Marshall maybe maybe like this
no like this
has more bass
sounds witnessing
going together
look for this
oh so this is like the old Texas
mimicks
it's quite bass-heavy at maximum it's it
retains all the haste so maybe let's use
Bayes net it will become slightly louder
also increase travel to maximum
so again volume at maximum for the
master
if they don't have this red-faced mr.
history
some metal with a massage Footwear to
shine
and that was one hit but somehow morning
what define but the thing to hear
that we reduce bass but it's still quite
quite pet sounding
so in my personal opinion I think that
the marshal kid onto is definitely a
nice upgrade over the old one being
louder nicer sounding but it's no game
changer so the J really extreme cool
sound justice nice it looses basic
maximum but remains somehow more punchy
without the strong compression I mean it
had no chance against there me lyrics
here and at normal levels I even like
the ankus on commotion class anymore it
hadn't a nicer sound dispersion although
it should offer you a kind of 360 degree
sound it's somehow phase as the back
rather doesn't contribute that much to
the sound so this whole the online
processing gets a little bit lost
compared to the stock well - I think
this sounds way more open when I saw of
course without this power also loses
dynamics at high levels loses face so
the Kilburn tool does a nice job here
but it's not some kind of no game
changer or something revolutionary it's
a nice upgrade over the old one but some
might get annoyed by this rather mono
sounding effect you get so from front
you really get only one channel the
other one is projected backwards and you
could hear it also gets some slight
reverb effect similar like we had from
the stock well - so it sounds a bit fake
it doesn't reproduce what was recorded
together with this slightly with
frequency response and not quite sure
how to set the - also because the bass
already starts to a lot of below hundred
Hertz it reaches quite deep but the peak
is between 100 and 200 Hertz so too much
upper base making the Sun somehow
booming closed it's some kind of inside
the box sound so it doesn't offer you
this nice open sound of the stock well -
yeah but it's not bad by no means so it
doesn't have any issues does not distort
does not fart or whatever it does a nice
job but I think it must suit your own
taste for my taste it's a little bit too
hard and too artificial sounding but I
like the design more than from the old
one it doesn't look that that retro
anymore so it looks quite nice I think
and next time we'll of course compare
the Marshall Tufton against some other
ones and
they're not quite sure what to use here
but yeah let us let us surprise so I
hope you liked this video about the
Marshall kid on tow really a nice become
also if you can get it discounted what I
like it doesn't need any external power
supply but you need some 220 volts you
cannot charge it by USB or like with the
anchor and with the stoplight oh yeah
and nothing has to say about the key
beyond to check it out from a database
again compared to some other speakers
but I think it sounds a little bit too
closed to boo me somehow
so the turning base down doesn't really
help here yeah thanks all for watching
and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
