motivate look at Damascus taqwa - yeah
this was quite a surprise for me
especially after knowing the old
marshals taqwa
so this is something completely
different this is maybe the first
portable bluetooth speaker released for
2019 that really caught my attention and
I would like to thank Thomas again for
making me curious about it he told me
how great it was
I ordered it and it's really something
particular maybe not the best portable
speaker around but it has this something
that many other more traditional
Bluetooth speakers are simply missing so
it could become the best portable
speaker for summer 2019 it's not the
loudest but it has simply this magic
that many others because a lacking maybe
remember some two years ago I reviewed
the Marshalls talk about the old one and
it sounded just horrible I compared it
against the base pyramid not perfect by
any means but simply way better still
there were many people saying that the
Marshall sounds better especially with
rock and so on it doesn't sound
good so if you are expecting the same
sound or similar sound you will be maybe
disappointed but this place on a
completely other level this is a two-way
design so it has a big woofer here with
one Twitter at the front and a lot Rita
at the back and also a big purse afraid
in the specs I'll sweeten it's a bass
reflex system maybe they assume that
purse Raiders are also best bass reflex
which is not true and the last thing is
it's not just playing the left and right
channel to the front and to the back and
but it uses this bloom line scenario
technique which is a little bit
different so it summarizes the left and
right channel for the front with the
left channel out of phase for the front
and the sum of left and right with the
out of phase right channel at the back
sounds a bit complicated but it really
manages to create create some soundstage
that many other speakers are not
managing especially being in a more only
directional one it's quite non
directional so you can also listen from
the side and it still sounds good
unlike for example the JBL charge for
where you have to sit directly in front
so although the G being charged for
might be a better party speaker it's
slightly louder also a small punch at
maximum but also more screaming so the
marshall retains more bass but it's
maybe more compressed so if you are
expecting some key loudness
even extreme levels you will be
disappointed it's comparable to in
loudness to the Jamiat church for their
den on in via a but very change is
really at normal levels so at home also
outdoors if you don't intend to make
some party a pattern that it has a great
battery life it's somehow
splash-resistant I think IP exfoliated
has tone controls which are really
usable as I will show you later on later
we'll get inside also a listen maybe
also listen here out was a little bit
comparing it against the JBL church for
and before taking listen I did some
measurements I went outdoors measured it
from all angles as it's an
omnidirectional speaker so here's some
measurements at different volume levels
measured directly from front at around
50 centimeters and you can see there
seems to be some slight dynamic bass
adjustment for low levels but also some
bass reduction at higher levels let's
also have a look at the effect of the
tone control dives set to minimum and
maximum and you can see both bass and
treble seem to act is some kind of low
entire filter starting at mount one
kilohertz and now let's have a look at
the measurements from all other angles
here from back from the left and from
the right so if I ever I do this we will
get some kind of power response and you
can see that it measures rather neutral
without any Peaks there is some overall
tendency for a smile response always
some slight bass and treble boost but
aural I would say it sounds renature
especially considering that it's an
omnidirectional speaker which is meant
to be listened from all around I think
it sounds way better than the vo play a
two or the Dalek edge or even the p6
unfortunately I won't edit to the
database but probably noticed my
problems with Amazon affiliate account
so I cannot spend any time for doing
stupid recordings wasting my time
therefore let's have a listen now with a
kind of live video I will grab my DJI
Osmo action as a head cam also my banner
our microphones you should of course
listen with headphones put them up and
let check it out before getting into
later on I thought you might be also
interested how the Marshall Stockwell
two sons Otto's end let's compare
against the quite popular JBL charge for
this is the mattress Tocqueville playing
below half volume now
with JBL and I'm listening of X's on
purpose in order to demonstrate you the
more omnidirectional sound of the
Marshall so I can move around freely
here and still get a great sound from
all angles trivia you have to listen
exactly onyx is here to get the best
sound
it is of course quite a bit stupid for
portable speakers something else
Ottavia start sounding a little bit like
a toy
so the marshal regarding volume of
sounds bass volume and so on is not a
comparable to a chaebol extreme here but
also way more open sounding you'll get
some nice on stage even like this while
this sounds really anemic
let's ride this track I'll lean back a
little bit and although the table
cha-cha is not a slouch with bass you
can hear it doesn't have this this bass
power or volume especially at these
levels you'll get a nice deep bass which
then somehow gets lost at higher levels
so it really depends what you want I
will increase volume a JBL
so it really depends what you want and
now let's get into us let's start
comparing it to the GD mm if I've that
we will treat as a kind of substitute
for the old Marshall stock well in fact
this is quite a blatant copy with
exactly the same driver layout and the
sound is awesome all is the same I will
start with the new Marshall Soquel 2 you
can see that as I had neutral on both
and the track from princess feature so
let's have a listen
b5
and the nice thing about the tone
controls now instead they are quite
usable so people at the base at maximum
it still sounds okay while with veggie
GMM or the old stock well you think we
space to maximum you get this year
so they are not really comparable it's a
complete different kind of speaker
let's try some rock maybe bass is still
at maximum
this is just horrible so everything's
based in neutral again maybe increased
travel schedule also here using base
school filter with some slight
Incredibles
it's way more clarity way nicer sound
yeah this sound just broken so let's
compare it to the audio Pro Aaron C 3
the audio pro is playing with my custom
sound settings which has 12 at maximum
and also some slight bass boost
otherwise it tends to sound a little bit
more and also thin at low levels the
manager is playing with neutral settings
now and I'll start again with a master
key to playing first
yopo
again please basil it becomes much
larger sample
but they've got no higher
domination don't forget
the marshal is more kind of
unidirectional speaker or on a direction
I one still sounds great like this while
the audio part becomes quite muddy and
muffled there are lots of clarity here
so it doesn't matter where you listen
from it still sounds great
that's right this race so you can even
place it like this or this from the back
it's still some trade which is of course
nice for portable speaker your problem
here's some nice definition that as soon
as I stand up or listen from the path so
the marshal definitely does a better job
here
I also don't think that it's meant to be
listened like this exactly confront but
rather yeah walking around using it
somewhere outdoors in the garden or
whatever let's try this track so you can
hear although your approach is quite
large I may be twice the overall
cubature you can hear that the Marsha
can compete quite well at least at these
levels and has this particular clarity I
would even with this further slightly
maybe
fortunately that's just the way it's
gonna be but with some particular tracks
you can only hear it here that there is
some ambience to the sound some kind of
reverb which is not present in the
original recording you can hear this
with this track from the so persona
princess region there was some double
echo over so this is the price you have
to pay for this kind of processing as
left and right channels or fronting tech
are hardly playing out of phase you get
these effects here
like this maybe slightly better but
still you can hear some people here
so this sounds like a more normal
50 contracts some that way so let's
compare it against a yellow in Bangor I
set the tone controls back to neutral
and again another track from so person
police feature from the latest album
with the marshal Stockwell to playing
first also here can hear some enhanced
ambience or a reverb effect which is not
present in the original recording
thousand buddhas also sounds way more
closed because of this
again as soon as releasing of exes the
marshal still sounds great then becomes
even more muddy
that's why this here the vocals are
somehow trapped inside the speakers we
know with the Marshall it doesn't matter
where I stand
it sounds also great like this so as the
down is a more traditional speaker you
really have to see exactly fun
and listen to the sector from here it
sounds as if it was playing some large
Church
the denim is way more direct somehow so
it really depends a lot on the recording
how it was mastered what kind of effects
were used for those artificial effect
processors that add some reverb somehow
make the left and right channel out of
phase therefore you get some enhanced
Ravello pen from the master photo
that's what it is also here some very
enhancing processing inside the thread
which makes it very reverb II you can
hear there is some stereo broadening
mixed into the track the gel does it
nicely also add some slight reverb but
not as much as the marshal also loses
part because of this everything sounds
very distant rally there is some phase
trickery wood inside the track here
that's why this also the focus are
really muddy here they stand way more
out of this beaker
that's what it is some nice ambience the
song with this track it's not as
exaggerated and it also again add some
bass here
bass is mixing I will with us travel
slightly
there is completed on a signal
but it'll hear those drums the bass drum
is way more distinct here while here it
melts somehow to develop the rest yes
let's turn based on three o'clock
sounds also nice but again if I stand up
and listen from the back it becomes like
this it's increased volume slightly
let's buy this wreck and I will increase
volume to maximum and you will hear that
the marshal is not such a loud speaker
show you some compression here that
there are on the other end also struggle
a bit but still remains watching cold
so the macho sounds way more processed
here
so it's another sounds great if you
decrease volume play around 2/3 we
thought maybe and last but least let's
compare to the FE force law the FIFA is
playing with late at mode which
increases based lightly so I also turned
base to around 3 o'clock here and let's
start again with a mash the stock with a
few fun it's also a way more direct
sound
something else is a very precise very -
sound but again slightly off axis and
yeah it's not listening to any more
immersion stereo sounds normal
even from behind here
so this is a completely different type
of speaker or vote modest precise onix's
models true to them to do journal coding
is simply way more usable if you listen
close you can really hear some left
right here
the balance of the instruments is
slightly off on a Marshall but it still
makes it stop enjoyable somehow misra
district
the FIFA doesn't want to connect somehow
yeah I lost it
sorry no true what's going on here I
hope I can hook my phone there is this
iPhone so here it is
so we are back here and you can hear the
sound is not as reverb II again why with
the stock wheel tool it's way more it
sounds as if played in some large Hall
or whatever that's why this right
she did before they gathered it to make
sure it was this witness has saw me in a
big body and comedy space - mixing
you can hear how it changes suffixes yes
so here the marshal is way not as
critical
depends what you want but for my purpose
I really love the result the mushrooms
giving here let's read this but if you
listen to this Geetha here which is a
little bit pat metheny like you can
hardly hear it it's so distant
the Oslo place this normally
as some some of compressed
so as if some limiter was was applied
here
so not all recording some great through
the Marsha yeah you cannot have it all
obviously here everything is perfect
that's what is
also these levels and also because of
the scale processing you lose quite a
bit of punch and drive heavy for slow
listen to this
this sounds just different from out
now increased volume for the incredible
in here that base is completely
processed away somehow
while the FIFA still plays it normally
although this sounds more open somehow
more free here let's write this right
face is trying to maximum here that
people keeps the base at the normal
level doesn't process it somehow
compress here is one so it's not a
speaker for wrap and place it in music
somehow although we turn base to make
them we can hear
so the defense the way more true and way
more precise because that's why this and
I will turn the Masha for maximum you
can hear it becomes a little bit get
compressed and strange-sounding the FIFA
I should have reverted it back to
neutral mode but the difference is quite
obvious here
I hope I could show you where the limits
of the speaker so for someone may be
expecting pati loudness you will have to
look for something else but even a JBL
extreme tone is louder but doesn't
necessarily sound better at maximum it
also reduces based way too much so you
need other speakers like the FIFA or
slower larger like the hiya XS 9 and so
on but for what it is I'm quite
impressed and I like it so much that I
ordered a grey one which is maybe better
suitable for putting autos into the Sun
it won't heat up that much so I would
send this back it also came with a dent
here in the grille and I will keep my
gray one here apart from that I didn't
mention it's charged by USB see you
could see it from my unboxing which is
also nice it supports quick charging it
can also charge external devices but you
would need a USB C to USB C or lightning
cable yeah I think I covered all I like
it really a lot but it's definitely not
the speaker for everyone also you could
hear with particular songs because of
this bloom line processing because of
this out of face processing there are
some issues so the reverb effect becomes
quite dominant with particular tracks
this is a normal normal effect because
the mixed in artificial reverb effects
which come from effect processors are
usually slightly out of phase in order
to make the sound a paper order so if
you recall some vocal which is mono and
you want to add some ambience some room
you add and a reverb effect and this
usually uses out of phase tricks so this
together the auto face processing this
bloom line effect creates some
disadvantages with particular tracks but
with normal recordings which were
recorded naturally there shouldn't be
such problems apart from that you could
hear it sounds really impressive for
this size not only bass but it also has
this clarity which many others because
are simply missing like the Denon via
although it's a rather neutral neutral
it eun-hwan
it still likes this this this clarity
this this direct sound
the marshal Stockwell tool so really
really applaud kudos to Marshall for
releasing this unfortunate I won't have
the chance to to test the Cuban tool
neither of the Tufton or if Marshall
asked me to do so yeah feel free to send
me a unit and I will do but I cannot
afford buying speakers anymore I hope
this video was a bit helpful could give
you a third idea about the sound
qualities of the Marshalls taco - also
about the floors because of this bloom
line processing not all tracks sound
great but I think overall it does a
really great and really great job and
becomes my speaker summer 2019 award
because I thought there will be much
much better ones or many better ones
coming out this year who knows but as
for now the Marshall staccato definitely
gets my award thanks for watching and
see you next time bye
come eat up today push me getting party
a scream
sorry I shouldn't like from here yeah
choices Sony Kunis regnant loose nigga
so before getting indoors I thought you
might be interested other Marshall stock
with two sons okay so before getting out
so before getting in the slate on a
c-stand dog so before getting in those
later on I thought you might be
interested how the marshals taco two
sons autos and let's compare against two
JBL charged to him to talk a bit then so
before getting in those later on I
thought he might be interested how the
marshal stock with two sons autos and
let's compared against the quite popular
JBL church for Muslims only emerges for
collection a so before getting in dose
later on I thought he might be
interested how to pack a model actually
it's an imploding focalin christening
so before the so before getting English
later on I thought he meant before
getting in those later on I thought you
might be interested howdy marshal
Stockwell two sons auto mount laws the
I'm listening of axis on Turtles to
demonstrate you the omnidirectional
sound of the marshal to marshal cool
gear door draw Bulldog sama before
getting in the state on I thought it
before getting in those later on and
listen before getting in verse later on
I thought he might be interested how the
marshals dr. Toussaint autos and let's
compared against the quite popular jails
at four
before getting in those later on I
thought you might be interested how the
marshal stock where two sons outdoors
and less compared against the quite
popular JBL charge for this is the
national soccer field playing below has
volume now not the most experienced name
chefs are the skip stock net the skip
