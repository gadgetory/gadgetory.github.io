here, look, they are already here!
even all colors, have a look!
look, in yellow it looks really cool, doesn't it?
do we want to hear it?
and the old one is also here, great!
we can start immediately
look, already connected
look how the pretty the lights are flashing, what do you think?
let's take the app
where is the sony app, music center?
settings...
live sound
sounds a bit muddy
doesn't sound that famous
maybe I will set the treble to maximum
what do we have here? Extra bass...
are they serious?
let's try again live mode
this sounds quite OK I would say
we could also try the old one, how this sounds
the old one, look this is the old model
this is the successor model
it is also available as big
yeah, it's also available as big, exactly
so, where is it?
phew!
does not sound that good
yeah, I don't know
because the other one has live mode active
the old one doesn't have this
but it sounds very, very strange... muffled
what we could also try, look the big one, the very big one
it is also available like this, look!
oh, the very big one!
can you lift it?
it is heavy isn't it?
not heavy at all, it's very light!
let's try it
you have to....
look how small this one is
yeah, but we already have such one in black. we have this one
so, where is it?
here it is!
which one is this?
look, it is standing over there
it a kind of JBL Flip copy
heh?
distorts a little
what happened to this one?
this one is much better
let's turn off this one again
strange isn't it?
sounds like a kitchen radio
this one on the other hand has no bass at all
sounds much better the other one
which one sounds better?
the yellow one!
because this one has only bass
it has only bass, exactly
let's try another song
this live mode is not bad
this doesn't sound good, because there is not that much bass, right?
wait, I'll try to switch to the other mode
we won't buy it because it doesn't have much bass
duh, this sony app
it doesn't work at all
hmm
it doesn't thrill me at all
should we buy it?
no, not at all!
no?
because it sounds so strange
look, this is standard mode
that's the smallest one, isn't it?
yes
extra bass,...
not that much difference!
and how does this one sound?
we will listen to it later
here the live mode gives the best result
I can even carry it with one hand, it is very light
doesn't sound that great
and the other one?
somehow the bass is missing here
doesn't sound that decent
I think we should rather take another one
wait, I'll try to switch again
oh well...
I am not sure, I would like to try it
at home it sounds maybe better, which color should we take?
white?
look, white or yellow?
or black?
where is the black one? here...
should we take black?
no
yellow, or look red?
or yellow?
I think, hmm...
is this green or yellow?
let's take this one
this?
no, the yellow one
here, look
no, here!
but that's the small one, this is the big one, and this the medium one
so, come, we have everything
give me your hand
because that one was also great, that... what is it called? the small one...
so, sit to the front
wait, I'll take the windows down, because it is too hot in here
wait, that's too much, so...
do we want to have a look right away?
wow, it's pretty
have a look
and also shines so nicely
away with that!
I hope it will turn on
yeah, great!
let's close this again, what's going on here?
where is it?
of course you have to start pairing again
so, now we are connected
let's listen to this here...
it sounds completely different inside the car
there is only bass
ah like this you cannot listen to it, it's horrible
wait!
I am asking myself how one can switch all these different sound modes directly through the speaker?
but it's still not much better! maybe reducing bass a little bit
yeah!
ohh, that sounds really evil
standard
I think for high levels you need more extra bass
just like on the old one
how loud does it go?
look. we are not even...
...not even half right now
it can play crazy loud
maybe we could once put it outdoors close to the neighbour
don't scream that loud!
so, it is loud and it was still not maximum
why do you want to put it at the neighbour?
let's try extra bass again
on bass alone it sounds similar, but this live mode sounds better I think
sounds more open anyway
so, what else do we have?
but look, it already loses bass
and now it becomes bassy again, it always needs some time
so delayed, ohhh I come along a bit and I go away again
what else do we have?
but it doesn't play really clean I would say
I'll open the app again
but look, we are not even at half volume and it is already fairly loud
standard
pfff
but look, now some bass has come back
but the live mode sounds definitely best
do you want to play with it a bit?
so we can drive and do some shopping, OK?
so well...
here the phone
let's close this, air condition on
and let's go
can you also change the color?
I don't know, through the app I think
wait, I'll make you the app
and look, wait wait...
there are settings
then illumination
and here you can select different ones, yes?
so, I'll drive off
why don't I actually drive to the front?
it doesn't change at all
try it, I think you have to press ok at the end
select one and then ok
look, select one
and then &quot;finished&quot;, and then you have to go back into the menu
only then it will change, ok?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
