mysterious new speaker unfortunately I
cannot reveal it now is it still a
prototype or a very early pre-production
unit the only thing I can tell you is
that it will be released within the next
two months and it should cost below 200
bucks so it's quite comparable to the
top speakers in this class like the Bose
Soundlink mini 2 and the beats built
last that we've already heard before I
hope you liked my last blind test video
this time it will be only half blind as
we won't see what's playing here but we
will see these speakers I would like to
have a listen to the speaker together if
you'll I covered it by an acoustically
transparent material so it shouldn't
compromise the sound match as always I
will be using binaural microphones you
really have to listen with headphones
for best results because listening to
binaural recordings through speakers
doesn't work well so please put your
headphones up and we will have a listen
for this new baby here I will start
playing with the mysterious prototype
speaker and we'll compare it to the post
on link mini first
big big battle battle
started with a ruler to do well
stidham's step up that bo-buddies and
blue pepper its or something else
maybe something classical from Vivaldi
it's really coming out of here so
there's not some fake effect
let's try something more modern
and the mornings overtime a Java makes
you lose your mind things you do to get
more pain like just seem so mainstream
let's try this
or something like this
there you have to sit directly in front
of the goals to really get some sound
but despite the difference there is
still some nice stereo separation here
while with the boss this is a mono sound
more or less
now let's try the beats pill plus
instead it's quite a bit more expensive
although price has dropped recently so
it's not that expensive anymore I'm
starting again with this mysterious
prototypes
start something else
for some piano jazz
yeah but now everyone should hear that
this simply doesn't sound right
not sure what the Beats technicians were
smoking but this is unusable
what do you think and how do you like it
please leave your comment I think that
it's pretty promising already now and I
look forward to trying out the final
production unit I am only asking myself
why such speakers like the beats pill
plus or the Bose Soundlink mini to have
to cost that much
Bose didn't manage to improve on the
sound of the original sound like me
during the last three years while the
pill plus sounds a bit like my old
muffled Kitchen radio so it will be
probably other companies that manage
something better we've heard that there
is still lots of potential within the
small form factor with nice stereo
separation nice clear sound so let's see
what future brings maybe in one month
one and a half I can already reveal what
was playing here so stay tuned I hope
you liked it so far have a nice time
thanks for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
