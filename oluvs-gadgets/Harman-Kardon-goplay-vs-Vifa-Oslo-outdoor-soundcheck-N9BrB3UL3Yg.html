therefore to keep it short
here I have Stacy force law definitely
one of my favourite portable speakers
pretty small light but pack some serious
punch also really loud I know that it's
not a boom box but I total comparative
or slow to the Hamaker and play outdoors
how they are able to fill the space here
with music which one is better which one
has more bass is louder and so on
therefore yeah as always I'll be using
my panel microphones and the head cam
put your headphones up and let's check
them out this is also is playing it
neutral so I should be able to crank it
to maximum we have Distortion yes volume
a little bit frozen and I'll start with
the Hammond currently we are around
report or to third row Liam and I will
turn on to maximum later on the c-4 slot
oh yeah look increase volume for maximum
on this maximum on the default Lana you
can't play Xhosa Maxima
if interest is the hammock homeless with
more punchy but also software which
really affects the kind of smoke Jeff
and maybe 480 meters away no if he falls
long
slightly different sounds left me but
somehow more bass let's try an effect
yes family 25 meters now also what you
can hear at their face is well how can
we be Passat it for the thief also here
on maximum this has this punch typical
Harman Kardon punch I'll try to go away
even further
yeah and I'll shake be a great thing
about the home column column place that
it doesn't distort at all
I'm complained about farting Pesa
creators that I don't have this problem
I tried the heaviest section no farting
at mine
we also quite a bit louder but doesn't
have the typical punch so for dance
music nothing
Collin Collin definitely is the better
choice also here the based on infield is
distorted
not right and maybe let's chickens like
elf axis thanks to the Twitter's the
hammer column gunplay should yet discuss
the sound and exert a we can hear a
travel company bit more mushy from the
default slot
so he uses if they also was struggling a
bit with this track coming up fairly
punch it down here you can hear from
readiness from the based on
yes I'm a con should be able to pay bit
louder thankful to really impressive
yeah yeah the power go the more not get
get from how very out you know
any is more thirty thirty-five meters
away or something
it doesn't have this bass heavy punch
from their helmet elegante
looks like this some kind of metal
yeah you can hear the better myth from
the off loss we hear the contra
definitely gets lost so it's not so
basic music it's yet another story
you're going to try another band track
and I will try to go as far away as I
can without losing local connection with
the second plane out but from this
distance it becomes really soft
so yeah outdoors depends what you want
for really basically music there a long
column definitely does a better job but
with no rock and metal and everything
they're all slowly quite a bit louder Oh
nearly frozen sorry but I think it's not
that easy to find the real winner the
thief's awful despite being smaller and
lighter is really not a than the Harman
Kardon gameplay but it doesn't have this
typical Harman Kardon JBL party so for
really heavy bass music the Harman
Kardon really shines there is no
distortion at least not with manual it I
tried every track and it really plays
everything clean this is also with
especially with kicks so Alice a little
bit sometimes I think this is not
typical distortion but rather airflow
from that participated it is for passive
radius to hear to hear
oh it's which are sandwich types all
double and there is some airflow because
of a thin slit so it's more comparable
to to some port noise but it is not
really Distortion so because of this
size yeah disadvantage it has over the
Harman Kardon play they had read pack
everything together
for example the Copenhagen has normal
passively episodes you won't get this
 but still it's really a great
speaker it's not cheap but one of the
greatest yeah it's therefore I chose it
for the best speaker 2016 let's see what
2017 will bring I hope you like this I
have to go home it's really really cold
and see you in the next video
have a nice time and bye bye
