I sound but I present it recently still
have some attention with people asking
now is it better than this or that
speaker or some even complaining why are
there no new videos I want to hear it
why is it not included within the
database yet I want to compare it
against some others because yeah keep in
mind I also have a private life I'm
doing all this for free for fun nobody
pays me for doing videos I bought this
with my own money this is a low budget
speaker you can get for $33 this was the
cheapest offer I found so yeah buy it
and test it by yourself I just wanted to
show it to you is it's not a known brand
I found Bauer I don't know but I think
it's really decent for what it is for
$33 I mean it's not a great all-rounder
but I thought I would like to
demonstrate you how it compares against
some other speakers also low budget the
anchor 459 the JBL flip 3 goes for 79
now the Denon and buy a mini depends
where you live but I think it's hundred
fifty in America and we have the band
Olson do play a one I mean this is not
the best speaker heck no but for low
level listening personal listening as I
told you pull it below your monitor
display listen to some soft music and
you will be really impressed it's not
something for high levels you will hear
that the sound starts to fall apart a
little bit but yeah let's compare it
against some other speakers and we will
start with the anchor premium first and
then later on we'll compare it against
some others so let me play some tracks
always starting with the I sound bar
which plays with its 3d mode is I think
this is the best sounding one and we can
hopefully get a better idea how it
compares against their slightly more
expensive anchor so please have a listen
banker
yeah if you can hear that it sounds much
more opened also much broader and even
more pleasant I would say maybe another
crack we hanker appears even slightly
muffled although it has some upper
treble but it's just missing this
clarity
they even slightly low me sounding
banker let's start with some rough track
because the sound stage is really nice
you have left and right stereo something
completely missing from the encourage
where focuses the sound brother inside
the speaker
maybe let's try the JBF 83 now they feel
free one of my favorite aromas also
costing more than twice as much will
become a bit strange and maybe cheap
sounding compared to the ice on path so
let's have a listen again JBL
JBL
you can also find lower levels which is
where the I sample definitely shines
but yeah this scary image is completely
missing from the JBL flip 3 even if you
put it closer to your nose there is not
really much stereo so yet maybe let's
try the demo and buy a mini which is a
much more premium speaker now let's
compare the ice on pike instead then on
buy a mini which also has some waves
processing including max pace max treble
and makes 3d just like the eye samba so
let's have a listen the denim we
although the denim has definitely a much
flatter more and more high five tuning
which sounds a bit recess them and
boring compared to the ice sound bar
demo again
Oh
it has nice the upper treble but also a
piece maybe slightly muffled
is it just fantasy
this has just this open sound which all
the others are completely lacking maybe
some dance trick
at that one
maybe let's try the bang &amp;amp; olufsen Leo
play a one which costs you f8 seven
times as much so let's see how the
cheapo low-budget China's figure
compares against the premium bangle doll
Cynthia play a one
yeah of course it's just a mono speaker
but you can really hear this problem it
would meet two of them for real stereo
which would cost around five hundred
dollars compared to 33 or 34
also slightly more open sounding evolved
not only directional
another track also here they increase
stereo imaging is pretty obvious day one
yeah it's Larry
very yes very mano
I'm not sure I would pay 500 for two if
I could get one like this for $35
another track
it sounds somehow boomy and covered
although maybe despite being on the
directional you would have to put it
upwards
of course they're a sambar has its
limits example here we could maybe hear
some bass distortion avoid it place it
clean anyone sound somehow booming of
course let's see what happens if we
increase volume get from behind although
not only directional it still sounds ok
of course so this is the a1 mouth and I
will increase volume this is maximum on
there ice sound bummer there's some
slight distortion why the a1 can play
much louder
yeah the difference is really huge here
I will reduce volume again the a1 sounds
based around half volume but I think in
this case the high sound bass sounds a
bit more convincing it's going to be
some funk track also lower levels stay a
1 mouth yeah I mean depends what you
want for low level listening I am really
impressed with the I sound bar as it
gives you an open sound also full sound
than a 1 this sounds somehow get more
interesting because of its spacious
sound yeah because there was some
question you can of course change tracks
by keeping volume plus pressed or - I
didn't know or I noticed later and I
tried a 64 GB card it played without
problem so I don't know where the limit
is if 64 is the maximum or if it will
would work also with 128 battery life is
not that great although it has 4000
milliamps I think I got around 9 hours
at half volume which is yeah let's see
you have one is around this is around
half also
it's comparable to to half volume of
their or even more we have one notch
above half on the a1 and I got nine
hours around nine hours at maximum I got
more than three but I noticed that it
started to reduce volume after run ten
minutes so the first day mates were
maximum and then it slightly reduced its
volume and continues to play with this
volume for three hours so it's
definitely not an outdoor party speaker
but yeah not the best all-rounder but
definitely the best speaker for $35 I've
heard I mean I have to confess when it
arrived there was some rattling and
inside I opened it like that I will show
you and inside was some loose part so I
mean the build quality is definitely not
best the touch controls a bit sensitive
okay I can I can pad now it works inside
was I think there okay let's turn it off
was the NFC antenna which was which
became loose and it fell out but it
works the first one problem the other
problem is there is some slight fat
thing I think coming from the passively
I will see if I can remove the grill
yeah especially noticeable with with
with sine tones so I will play some tone
I think you see this is not great build
quality I mean there is some glue here
and I think that the Pasiphae that is
not completely airtight
let's see
this is the a1 no sorry yeah because I
turned down the other one off sure so
let's turn it on again
Bluetooth waiting for connection I mean
you cannot expect top-notch quality for
for that price I will go switch to 3d
mode yeah there is some switches like
this and let's try the same phone again
there is some slide I don't know I don't
know if it's processing or fifties if
really air is coming out but
you can hear some with some songs you
can hear it definitely that there are
some problems maybe some some wire is
loose inside and touching the PC Frieda
I'm not sure so it's definitely not
perfect but I mean it's it's nice
speaker for thirty dollars not the best
all-rounder so and yeah if you need some
something like that go out and grab one
the cheapest price was on Aliexpress I
think for thirty three thirty four
dollars I think it's really worth it
yeah not the best picker but very very
nice if not the tones and the voice
prompts I would like it even more
yes at night when I want to listen to
some soft music I cannot quite turn it
on the a1 this has some pretty hefty
bass distortion as well
yeah this is not a clean sign tone
so I hope this was helpful
of course it's already edited within the
database I recorded it with normal
settings which are which it plays quite
clean I also recorded it with 3d mode
where you can hear with some bass drums
you can already hear this strange
farting and I omitted the bass mode as
this one really distorts at this level
already it starts to distort at half
level it sounds ok below half but it's
this base mode is really only suitable
for very low level listening so you can
compare it against some others and yeah
I hope this was helpful I hope you liked
it and see you next and I cannot say
when I will have time for the next video
is currently I'm quite busy also my son
it's the little bit sick so yeah be
patient
I think the new calf gravity one should
appear soon or I already got some info
that I could get a sample hopefully so
we will here the calf gravity one which
is of course the most premium small
speaker I have seen for $380 I think so
I am really curious to hear it and some
other stuff also coming the creative
high roar I already showed you once also
the eye or go this coming soon so lots
of stuff but a little time currently so
here be patient a bit have a nice time
and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
