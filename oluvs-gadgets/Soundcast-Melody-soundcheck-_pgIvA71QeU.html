Antonia Vienna a place with a big
musical history as Ludwig van Beethoven
spent lots of time here we'll also do
some music although not quite as serious
and I came outdoors because I got an
outdoor speaker this is the sound cast
melody it's already an older model I
think two years old but I got this for a
test and I thought we should give it a
try and have a listen this is a
360-degree speaker and the only other
360-degree speaker that I currently have
is this phillips bt 6600 yeah it's
smaller so let's see how it compares
another speaker I brought is the JBL
extreme it's also a bit smaller also
cheaper so we will have a listen if this
sound cosmonaut is really worth its
price tag it costs around $400 this cost
300 there's around 150 what else to say
it has track controls on top
it can even be charged through microUSB
something the JBL extreme cannot which
is strange I mean it's a big speaker
with huge battery the battery is
exchangeable so in case it dies you can
put another one inside yeah as always I
will be using binaural microphones for
the recording and you should listen with
headphones then you will get a pretty
realistic impression please put them up
and we'll have a listen I set them up
here and we'll walk around so you can
hear which one has better and more
events on this version at first I won't
tell you which one is playing so you can
judge on your own which you like more
and so on although if you listen with
headphones you will of course hear one
more to the left
the other one to the right I will be
playing some tracks from Salt assalam
let's have a listen
yeah I was impressed as well how thin
the melody sounds this is the Philips
now and this is the melody of course if
we increase volume this difference will
increase our solid seven listen this is
maximum volume of the Philips
y'know the melody sounds more
full-bodied more mature a surprise
attack
but as already said I was really
surprised how thin it sounded at it at
lower levels at home it sounded like a
kitchen radio a sizzling one
okay now the JBL extreme and I will step
back a bit father and we'll have a
listen again of course that JBL is not a
360-degree speaker so I will walk around
anyhow to see how it sounds from behind
starting again with the melody now
yeah there is not much from behind
except bass it's a pity they didn't put
in drivers at the back as well like they
did with the Infiniti one this would
have made it a real nice party speaker
much more directional compared to the
melody let's increase volume a bit this
is maximum volume on the melody
not that JBL
yeah there is
both are not singing but the melody will
be stored this is the JBL simply becomes
a bit dirty but the melody produces
Oliver Distortion
I will put them on the floor and this
increases bass a little bit of course
bluetooth which will also be lower but I
will step back as both a plane at
maximum volume I'm starting again with
the
yeah I hear only distortion and the bit
muffled sound the Trivium also it feels
slightly louder although this changes
when I step side words on axis it's
pretty nice but effects is you know you
lose loudness and also treble okay this
is the Bluetooth reach of the melody
already breaking up JBL was still
playing well many people were
complaining within the comments that the
JBL has such bad Bluetooth which well I
don't think so it's pretty good and much
better than many other speakers
but the distortion is unbearable let's
try it on track and it's not very loud
that in the jiggle extreme is already
not the loudest speaker on but compared
to the melody
it sounds cleaner somehow fuller not
really good let's try some kind of
they also
quite a bit better here look on the side
mode
of course as an edge but the distortion
is unbearable
let's listen to some kind of rock well
no it sounds as if it was broken
no my house tricks maybe this is better
no it's you cannot listen for it for
this like that I will reduce maybe
volume or notches
yeah it's better the extreme avoid still
maximum
sounds a bit tool I will reduce the
extreme also some notches on this level
yet the amenity appears to have a little
bit more punch although for that price
well I am not really convinced yeah I
hope this could give you an idea about
the sound cast melody also compared
against the JBL extreme maybe not really
comparable this true I think the fool XL
would be better but I didn't get any
unit and I'm not sure if I really get
one at all so thanks for watching
yeah it's maybe a nice speaker but not
for $400 that's simply too much also at
low levels it sounds like a like a teeny
seasoning kitchen radio really nothing
to write home about it yeah I hope you
liked it and we will see us in the next
video until then have a nice time and
bye bye
