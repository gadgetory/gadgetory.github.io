the bangle doll of some pure-play e82
wireless in-ear headphones sorry I'm a
little bit late to the party in the
meantime they released a new version the
e8 2.0 but this was sent to me by one of
my viewers who was so kind to lend it to
me so thanks Rudolph and I'm sure many
will be still interested in knowing how
this one performs because I think it's
quite a highly rated in here from what
I've seen and you can also get it for
cheaper right now the original price was
I think three hundred three hundred
fifty dollars now Amazon below two
hundred so there may be still some who
are interested in this I'm also getting
requests repeatedly to review some
wireless headphones and this time I
would also like to throw in the solo
liberty plus so we will compare these
two this is a little bit cheaper around
hundred hundred ten dollars so half the
price but first let's look at the
packaging of the e8 I don't have the
original packaging of the solo liberty
plus anymore but you just need a
charging cable and this charging box the
one from the ocean is premium like it's
written here premium charging case so
leather look I think this feels even
more premium because this is out of
metal this feels like some plastic
inside are some additional tips not much
charging by a charging is done on both
with micro USB maybe the new one has
yeah wireless charging or USB see nor
quechua and let's look inside
so both are quite similar size-wise you
have to keep the the master which is the
right one you'll hold this touch area
for one second and it turns on and the
first problem I noticed yet they are
quite light I think the solo liberty
plus is a little bit heavier maybe no
not really
also quite comfortable so just put it
inside it turns on automatically if not
press this button here and for charging
put them in again like this not sure
which one is left right but what I
noticed here is that they reach between
both the left is the slave is horrible
so when I play some music
you read this I have the right one in my
ear or I have rather the left one in my
ear and I cannot hear it so I have to
put them really close like this
I have no sound anymore now it plays no
it breaks so it's very it's very yeah
when I just touch it it breaks up the
left one here when I wear both normally
but as soon as I take it out of my ear
it breaks up I don't get this with the
doll or any other in here I had really
problems recording it because it didn't
play anything helpful to leave some wire
and some antennae then it worked
but I had problems because this
obviously absorbs more mmm
electromagnetic radiation than a head
maybe they really they designed it to
have exactly just the reach to be put
inside the head like this it already
breaks up so and okay so maybe one with
some big head will already head problems
and sound wise yeah you have this touch
area if you keep it pressed it becomes
louder I'm not quite sure how to make it
softer at the left maybe at the left
side you have some threatened how do
they call it awareness mode or something
you also get this app where you can find
you in the sound which I would like to
show you how this works you have this
this matrix let me connect and you can
slide a dot around and the sound changes
but you never know quite exactly what
happens so you cannot find unit and I
think the original tuning is already a
bit off I will put it inside here and
play you analogue from so persona in
Princes future also player onto this dot
here but keep these samples always with
a little bit of a reservation
don't take them too seriously they just
should give you offer you a general idea
about the sound if you listen with some
headphone
even a good one you will probably get
something different than if listening to
that to them life I mean it's true but
you should get some exact or create
relative differences later on we'll also
do this with the Jean le petit PLAs also
comes with an app also has this
awareness mode where you hear what is
around you otherwise it isolates so it
has a microphone inside just like this
so the zonally petite class has similar
features but I think some ways it's a
bit better so I will play analog now and
later on we'll do this the same we will
do the same for there's already plus and
try all the EQ presets that are
available but first the Bo play eight
I think you could hear it sounds a bit
weird regardless where I place the dot
it never sounded right you can also open
the dot up for a more broader soundstage
but this also sounds off so the sound
shift towards the left side somehow
let's try the solo Liberty blast now
which is not perfect but I think it
sounds more natural over a little bit
bass heavy and I will show you all the
available presets with this solo live
app and let's have a listen again
for my personal taste I think the
classical preset sounds best not perfect
but balance becomes a little bit muddy
and to boo me at the same time the other
ones are not that great maybe let's have
a look at some measurements first they
ate this is uncompensated and you can
see there is some zigzag with base I
measured it with pink noise of a brutal
territory from the iPhone therefore it's
not that precise so you can see it looks
a bit strange and you get this peak at
around yes seven eight kilo Hertz and
meets especially this natural three kilo
Hertz peak is not that pronounced so
it's simply lacking
I will overlay the zora Liberty blasts
with that pop preset and you can see way
more bass also some drop in the upper
base here at 400 Hertz and a more
pronounced monitory response at three
kilohertz here also doesn't have this
weird peak between 7 8 kilohertz so all
a travel is much smoother let's take a
look at the jazz preset you can see it
boots bass reduces treble slightly the
EDM preset boots basing more classical
reduces bass and boosts treble slightly
while balanced brings bass to a more
natural response but also reduces travel
too much just for reference I will
overlay the sony MH 750 which is a 5 $6
in here and you can see yeah it has even
more response at 3 4 kilohertz why
trevor has an even more natural response
compared to the other two and although
the sony has the most bass it's still
the closest to the Harlan response
target apart from base but you can use
some accurate use bass or there are some
mods on the net yeah you seal it and
bass gets reduced so the Sony sounds
really nice
the anchor is
not that far off but there is some
weirdness with base you can see apart
from balanced all the other presets
reduce upper base and the balance preset
is to MIDI at the same time the e8 on
the other end is just weird it's a weird
response doesn't have this natural 3
kilohertz peak bass is also quite
recessed which is strange because
usually Bangor's is famous for their
bass heavy tuning but this sound just
off treble is off meter off everything
sounds just weird so I'm not quite sure
how this can get high ratings it doesn't
sound great if the new answers the same
then I mean $350 come on but let's
compare it with some other tricks I will
compare the e8 and the anchors oh la
liberté plus I will play the liberty
plus with this classical EQ I think this
sounds best and the e8 plays with
neutral settings I didn't find anyone
yeah that sounded really much better
I'll play some other tricks and at the
end I will give you my resume so listen
listen
is it just a dream my loving inside my
fantasies call to me you are in my
thoughts I never straight from the heart
of water
am i touching you I wanna feel every
part of these
yeah I mean it's really disappointing
$350 for something like that and I feel
sorry for all those who bought this and
think it's great because just effect
alone that it breaks up within 15
centimeters is just unacceptable
and yeah the sound is a little bit
questionable if you ask me looks nice
the scurrying box here is also nice
leather look
so quite premium I don't think it's
really that great the genre liberty plus
for half the price is not perfect but I
think it's it's it's way more fun to
listen to
also outside you need more bass I mean
you could use this dot and put put some
bass in but it still doesn't sound
normal
there is some weirdness here with with
the response of this in attuning yeah I
think nothing else to say if the new
82.0 sounds the same then yes stay away
from this this is really horrible
yeah thanks world for lending me this I
know Rudolf was not satisfied either
therefore he he wanted to know my
opinion about them and yeah I can
confirm that it's just pretty average
especially for this price it's horrible
I mean this is a sound of 50 maybe $40
in here the Sony mh17 four five six
dollars most is completely weight
although it's a little bit heavy but you
can mod it it's a pity that Sony never
released a new version based on the MH
one with more relaxed sound maybe
without this strange wire I'm not sure
because this has so much potential for
being a simple in a one driver design
they could have released some blood of
version out of it because the design
itself is close to perfect just had some
Bluetooth circuit around it maybe reduce
bass slightly
Awesomenauts for the image one to seal
it completely seal where the wire exits
seal the whole body and this only
reduces bass yeah I hope this was
helpful
connection failed please try again
thanks all for watching and see you the
next video
have a nice day bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
