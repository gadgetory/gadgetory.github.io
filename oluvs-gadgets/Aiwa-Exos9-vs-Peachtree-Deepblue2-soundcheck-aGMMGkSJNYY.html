Bluetooth monsters here this is the IVA
XS nine and a Peachtree the Bluto many
were asking for this comparison the main
difference between these speakers is
that the IVA excess line is still
portable despite being bigger it has
even a swept above battery so if you get
out of juice you simply put in another
one the Peachtree has to be attached to
mains as you can see but it also has an
optical input so you could use it maybe
as some kind of well a sound home system
for television and so on yeah I thought
we'll have a listen to both the Petri
even comes with an with a remote so you
can well control volume also bass and so
on I set base to neutral why the IVA XS
9 is playing with EQ of you can also set
an EQ with 5 bands but in this case I
thought it will be interesting to hear
them how they sound with neutral
settings it's always amusing of course
high quality binaural microphones and
you should listen with headphones to
really get the most realistic result mmm
usually I don't think many will be
listening to classic music with these
speakers but to really well judge the
differences in sound I think it's also
quite helpful to hear some real
instruments so I am starting with a
track form Edward Elgar and the IVA XS 9
first please have a listen
well both are not what I would call
neutral sounding they both have a pretty
well tuned and sounded frequency
response let's have a listen to some
oranges and maybe we will hear better
the differences the typical it sounds a
bit flatter than the iOS nine but still
not really neutral maybe a more modern
funk
here the base is a big pepper on the tip
blue but you can of course add a bit of
base you can see three dots is neutral I
will add a little bit this is maximum
base now
I will reduce paste again well one pole
modulo maximum is helping best make it
compared to the IR
maybe some smooth jazz
you
you
yeah the Iver swallows a bit the meats
let's try another track
you
against something else
maybe you're like boogie yeah maybe many
still remember that track I used before
from Antep Fela s opal opal remix the
previous track was also a palapa
production so let's have a listen to
this
yeah that face is much more booming here
from this position I'm probably standing
in a room mode
but that IVA somehow sounds still
convincing maybe let's try this kind of
hip-hop rap or something many are always
asking for rep so Mira yeah what you're
here is of course port noise the deep
blue is a closed system so it shouldn't
have any let's have a listen
yeah but still I think what you hear is
simply that the woofer is a little bit
well over driving or something like that
just like this it's like that
just like this but yeah I can definitely
hear port noise like that it's like this
like that it's like this is like that
maybe let's turn base form excellent see
what happens it's like this it's like
that it's like this well it's not solid
percent things like that
I think the base from the IVA is a bit
more punchy although well the port noise
can become a bit distracting maybe
there's missing some house I will reduce
space again one more yeah the IVA
definitely appears a bit more punchy
sometimes with the deep blue I have the
impression as if the bass was playing
along the music not ready together there
is some deep bass but it's not well it's
not integrated into the music
maybe there's no good
the egg appears a bit I don't know a bit
muddy not not so well defined you can
really hear the punch of the base from
pretty well while on the deep blue - it
becomes a bit swallowed
so what we'll be doing now is listen to
them at maximum volume I have to reduce
the gain of my ricotta which I'm doing
now you hear that my voice becomes
softer
yeah raise the volume in case you really
want to hear them how they sound at
maximum the IVA XS 9 is claimed to be
200 watts while the pitch free deep blue
2 has 440 so let's see if there is
really any difference in loudness both I
already cranked to maximum I'm starting
with the IVA XS 9 again
the Peachtree definitely appears louder
slightly and also cleaner let's have a
listen to another house track lots of
vibration and also odd noise a Peachtree
beginner maybe a rock back
whoa
already some distortion
Peachtree
and IVA XS 9 cannot really handle this
track at maximum yeah you can hear I
raised the gain again to normal yeah
both are great speakers but we could
hear that maximum volume was definitely
better handled by the Peachtree that
I've already introduced some strange
distortion which was yeah a bit nasty it
also plays a bit louder and more
controlled it makes them volume so if
you really need max you know the
Peachtree audio would do the trick but
it has to be attached to mains all the
time it's not a portable unit like the I
mean I can take it and put it somewhere
else and still listen to music this is
not portable not possible with the
Peachtree but still it's also 100 bucks
more expensive than the IVA so you
really have to know what yeah
what's your intention if you need a
portable unit the IVA is definitely
great while for home use there are I
would say better sounding units than the
Peachtree deep blue - it's not bad but
it didn't blow me in anyway I mean it's
loud and and it produces really nice
sound but it's not what I would call
audio file or refined enough so I hope
this could help you as a first
impression we will also do another blind
listening test also against the
Copenhagen you can see there and also
the TOEFL boom star Excel which is the
yeah these are the more expensive units
the IVA goes for 300 the pitch 3 for 400
while the other one around 6 700 so it
might be interesting to hear how these
compare against the more expensive units
all are portable
except the Peachtree which you all
always have to attach domains yeah I
hope it was helpful a bit I hope you
liked it so far the wait is over I think
you could hear the differences in sound
and yeah thanks for watching and see you
in the next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
