Halloween
hi guys so they wanted to make a short
video to demonstrate you how the JBL
party box sounds in verse each other
normally sting letters so probably only
hooded autos it makes the most titles
compared against some other larger party
speakers like the sony xfinity the toys
rock star or the GPL boom box but I'm
pretty sure many would be interested if
it can be used as a kind of home system
for normal live listening so at low
levels how it sounds then you can always
check them out from a database
I already included it so we can compare
it against any other speaker I think it
sounds way better than those offerings
there Xfinity xB 60 so not very
comparable but let's see how it compares
against a more high-end speaker which
was a smaller and also cheaper there how
much harmonics to do five you're
listening to a Panola artificial head so
you should listen with headphones use my
voice as an obvious reference to get ya
more or less the most realistic sound
impression I won't play the net loud so
the party box will be playing we doe
have their own X to the 5 is exactly
half volume now and let's settle the
party box first
without the space
this and all other moments
it's okay definitely much better
kitchen or bathroom or whatever because
the mantra has a better building I still
have to do a full battery test and make
some and curious to hear how long it
will last and then I will do if we'll
review some other functions like epoch
sounds into us environment it's not bad
definitely much better than the Sony or
even there's some bookstore which has a
very strange tuning great for autos or
so with this auto mode it makes him
sound it really football it taught the
system somehow more balanced more I find
with even better bass but not as boosted
is this on books too so yeah thanks a
lot for watching yeah my chrome my
doesn't it some improvement so it's a
sunflower he made this in the
kindergarten I hope you like this a bit
and see in the next video where I will
try to do a full review I won't get out
does any more just want to make another
SPL measurement of the party box also
Otto's when the wind will come down a
bit currently it's very windy so when
it's when the weather is okay again I'll
go out make an SPI measuring and then if
we review with hopefully a full battery
test yeah thanks for watching and see
you in the next video
