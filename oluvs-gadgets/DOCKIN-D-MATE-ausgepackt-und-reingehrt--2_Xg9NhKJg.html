really? what? wait, I'm coming
pardon?
let me see
why is it so dark in here?
will you manage to pull back the curtain?
yeah great, thanks!
where is it?
over there
ah great!
what has arrived here? would you like us to open it?
yes
ok then scissors
it's over there, but I think I will also need my phone
wait I will quickly pick up my phone
everything is being charged here
I think this is again some &quot;boomba&quot;
then let's have a look
I am curious as I haven't ordered anything
hey look, here is written &quot;Dockin&quot;
I think I know what this is, this is the new one Dockin D Mate
look, it looks exactly the same as ours, have a look
even 2 of them
no, it looks like the other one
where did you put it?
look, let's open it
where did you put it?
I don't know
wow, have a look!
you can let it hang somehwere
so, let's turn it on
let's see where it is
hey great, already connected
now we can start listening
don't they look equal?
no, this one is a bit smaller, look
yes
I think this one has 360 degree sound
what I have read
so, let's sart playing
yeah look, out of here is someting coming
and from here as well
hmm, but sounds a little bit strange I would have said, right?
let's turn to the other one
and, what do you think?
not good!
which one is not good?
not good?
we actually have a similar one
I think there is some kind of bass mode or something like that, wait
there must be a manual somewhere, how to manage?
let me see
no manual?
what is inside that black thing?
cables
what cable?
ah, look, like this
and, where is the bass?
better, isn't it?
hmm
no
which one sounds better?
this
really?
it sounds a bit...
a bit buzzing, hollow
ROXY!
you cannot even compare them well I would have said
sounds indeed strange, but at least you get the some sound from all angles
come with me, let's see how loud it can play
come on!
maybe another song, what do I have here?
that one
first I will increase this one, get back a bit
look, this is already maximum
it's indeed loud
nevertheless, somehow...
it sounds quite strange and droning
wait, I will switch off the bass again
because like this...
...you cannot even compare them well
I think switching was like that
without bass
so sit down here, don't stand that close
come to me
you know what, bring this one over there, the black one
exactly, turn it on
this one can play loudest, right?
no, the other one is also loud
don't press that long, simply press shortly
so, they should also be connected
yeah, it sounds strange, strange, I don't know, this is...
bass is somehow droning
let's try this
I mean this one doesn't sound great either, but...
maybe like that, If you place it like that it will become better
yeah, but it sounds not that decent anyhow
there is another one
you can probably connect them for stereo, shall we try it?
but the question is how this works
what happens if you don't turn on bass on this one and with bass on the other one?
that's a good question
ah, here is the manual, perfectly hidden
come out here
let's see what's written inside how to manage
quiet here
&quot;hej... fonte di energia, funzione viva voce&quot;
no, we don't need all this
English is even first
so we will also turn on this one
we are connected already
ahhh, how was this?
we will turn off this one, with this one I am already connected
now I have to press here for 3 seconds
where, is bluetooth? here...
1, 2, 3...
1, 2, 3!
hmm, and?
how to proceed?
I don't want to wait for a minute now
but it is writte like this
we did this
maybe not long enough?
or did I press another button?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
well, doesn't work, we have to try it next time
let's turn this off again
this one is also gone
so, here we are again
let's listen to another song
which ones do you like most?
I think there is an own playlist, here it is
but anyhow...
and the other one?
this doesn't sound that good
something is not right here, I don't know what
like this maybe
I turn volume up a bit, ok?
yeah, when it is loud it becomes a bit better, but nevertheless...
look, it sounds even a bit strange
without bass
it scratches a little bit
but this sounds good!
yeah?
doesn't sound good either
I think we will stay with this, this is still nr. 1 I would have said
let's pack it away. do you still want to play with it a little bit?
yes, or not?
I go cleaning again ok?
see you later
but I want another one
take whatever you want, here you have the Sony this is really great, OK?
but I want the yellow one!
ok, so take the yellow one
so see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
