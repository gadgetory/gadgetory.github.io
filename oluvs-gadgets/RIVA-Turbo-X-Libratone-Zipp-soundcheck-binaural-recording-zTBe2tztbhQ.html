ill today but this won't prevent me of
doing another useless YouTube comparison
video well yes many are complaining that
my videos are useless therefore I will
continue doing more of them I have two
particular speakers here the river turbo
X and the live rat on zip the greatest
thing about the library on zip is that
you can dress it with other pullovers
this is what I'm going to do now
voila it's yellow now cool isn't it if
you take a closer look at the design of
the librarians it you will notice that
it looks like a pretty cheap copy of the
UE boom and mega bomb but well is
exactly the other way around because
Ultimate Ears decided to copy some
design elements of lebreton including
this funny flap here
but what both speakers have in common is
that they are 360 degree omnidirectional
speakers the river isn't but it uses
trillium technology which has three
drivers one at the front and two at the
sides which comes quite close to a 360
degree experience of course not
fully but we'll test how both speakers
compare as long as we are still having
construction site at home I can set up
the speakers in the center of our room I
will use binaural microphones put them
in my ears I will also take a head camp
and then walk around the speaker's who
are similar to that just to show you how
they sound in reality and how they
perform in regard to 360 degree sound
dispersion I will be playing both
speakers close to their maximum volume
and as you can see I set up a sound
pressure level meter as well with the
measuring microphone being about one
meter away from the speaker's to give
you a better idea how loud they are
actually playing I will start with the
riveter blacks
another trick again Riveter boy explain
first
the sex of phone sounds more like a
clarinet on the lebreton zip let's try
another trick
Oh still lots of distortion from the
elaborate on let's see if the zip can
manage other genres better this is a
track from soul persona
still look like there
much cleaner sound from the river turbo
X let's have a look or let's have a
listen at something smoother some jazz
oh no please not I think you've heard
that both are definitely great speakers
but some are greater than the others
interestingly the lab returns if turned
off
in the mean time which means the
battery's low I'm surprised because it
didn't play for that long the battery on
the river turbo X is pretty solid as it
should play about six or seven hours at
maximum volume which is quite impressive
for a speaker with that kind of loudness
and volume I hope you liked another
useless clarinet junkie YouTube video
stay tuned for more see you next time to
support me please subscribe or vote up
or down whatever yeah bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
