before they would like to compare their
FIFA Stockholm 2.0 against my own audio
Pro a 2020s I've owned them for about a
year maybe I like them a lot in the
meantime I got used to their sound why
the FIFA is still quite fresh and new
for myself as well and I think some of
you have faced about this particular
comparison so let's compare them now
together but I don't think they are
really bet comparable with the FIFA
being a single cabinet speaker also more
expensive around thousand euros versus
600 euros but it has also more features
built-in it's equipped with Wi-Fi
matching functions the audio process
only bluetooth so for the same
capability you would need to attach some
external streamer which would increase
costs but they have the big advantage of
being a typical 2.0 system so you can
separate them far apart usually I have
placed them at the opposite sides of
this room this way they managed to fill
this large area with music quite nicely
but let's have a listen how they sound
one place like that
mmm it's a little bit uncommon placement
but I wanted to make it as fair as
possible so with the same wave this
should give us a comparable stereo image
of stereo separation and I will be
playing the FIFA with late night
unfortunately it's not officially
supported later on I will tell you how
to get access to all the additional
tunings and placements the audio process
are playing with my personal settings so
I busted treble three notches also based
slightly otherwise the song becomes a
bit more diffuse with my usual placement
and this time I would like to make it as
a kind of live video with me wearing my
pen or microphones also my head cam for
this ya live immersive sound impression
unlike last time when we compared to
FIFA against the name I swept this
because in between but this time I would
like to walk around a little bit so we
can also hear how they sound off axis
therefore put up your headphones and
let's check them out I'm connected to
both of a Bluetooth so switching between
one and the other should be more less
instant and let's start with a first
track in the FIFA Stockholm 2.0 plane
first
what we put there can be some
interruptions especially with the FIFA I
noticed it there is some repeated yes
pause when swooned over Drupal seems to
be some part and I reported it to new
pearpod
somehow they didn't acknowledge it the
other products employers listen from mhm
you have to say which one sounds better
I think it was a metal face but the
audio pros appear slightly more boxy the
same this
some out back
oh you know no one says a thing quietly
they go to sleep after so much time
lovers on the side
ah
they run away
be in its own
understand in the shape that the
elephant how'd it go
after spending so much time leading
separate lives unknown
is exactly centered here Natalie I don't
see anything because of the sunset
smile
come with a dynamic burner
makes you wanna fly
something else
that's right this
with you in the ground there was some
interruption I think as a sample tooth
part I hope FIFA will have a look at
this because
that's right
every day when I open my eyes
but they've got eyes
 out
walk friends
this and this from far away
that's like this if incise playing with
late-night so much relief it will
somehow distort like matter for us to
look at so far it's still pretty clean
you're wrong
that's why this trick maximum later her
let me know is quite a bit softer than
the neutral mode
therefore this is maximum volume
slightly volume is separate on the the
audio processor
this practice is quite heavy
maybe more limiting more compression you
can hear some side noises won't testify
to me like this it's okay
like this you know I think you'd hear
both were playing on a really high level
so it's a matter of personal taste which
will act more this or the other one
please tell me your opinion but I would
say that the FIFA plays more neutral
more natural especially with meats they
really put some emphasis into an actual
meat reproduction while the audio
process the spine being cheaper sound
it's really nice as well a bit more boxy
Bumi with bass also Trevor was a bit too
sizzling so I should have maybe reduced
it to a normal level but for my usual
placement father part traveller tends to
get lost a bit because I don't listen
exactly on axis so it becomes more
diffused therefore I tend to boost it
place like this it was definitely too
much but you could also maybe hear that
the FIFA at high levels with late night
tuning started to become a little bit
more uncontrolled with bass especially
the last track so you would have to
revert to neutral tuning at these levels
yeah how to get these tunings there is a
trick you need an older Android version
of the FIFA home app it's not available
for iOS nor for the recent versions I'm
not quite sure why FIFA pulled this
feature I asked them but didn't quite
get any answer so there is only one
trick you need an older Android version
then you get the access to all
additional tunings placements and so on
I hope in a future update it will become
accessible as well I think they are not
even aware that these functions are
included I'm not quite sure why they did
this so I will definitely keep the vive
if I didn't have the access to late
night I would probably I wouldn't
because at low levels I was missing base
slightly but with late night it sounds
amazing
especially placed closer to the TV set
maybe I will also try to use it as some
kind of sound but currently I don't have
any way how to place I would have to
elevate the TV set slightly but I like
both and I will keep both if Maddy was
an issue and you would have to decide
between this and this I would probably
go for the audio pros simply because
it's a real 2.0 systems you can separate
them they have both optical in the audio
processor to optical ins apart from that
yeah I think audio Pro is working on a
new version with Wi-Fi should be
probably called C 20s but this is just
the room or I'm not quite sure if it's
really true so yeah I hope you like this
comparison of the FIFA stock on point
two point zero against my
audio pros I like both and I will
definitely keep both the audio process
my main listening system and the FIFA as
reference so to be able to compare it to
some other single cabinet speakers like
maybe the JBL authentic yeah I hope you
like this have a nice time and bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
