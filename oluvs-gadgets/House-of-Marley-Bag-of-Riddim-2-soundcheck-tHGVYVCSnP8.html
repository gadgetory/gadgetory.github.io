at another back speaker Tipler complaint
the Harman Kardon go and play looks like
some woman's handbag this is indeed a
back it's also called back off reading
to enter this house of malice updated
version of the original bag of freedom
it's a bit smaller now but you can see
it's still designed like a handbag so
you can carry on like this or over your
shoulder and although maybe designed to
be placed flat you lose quite a bit of
travel definition negatives so it's
better to be placed on a side for a more
directional sound I bought it from the
local store for 220 years usual prices I
think $250 in Europe the Harman Kardon
guns they can also be found for 250
years so I think they are quite
comparable also a weight is not that
much different
this is 3.2 kilograms and this three
point four so I thought we will compare
these two but first maybe let's take it
out of this bag to have a more detailed
look at it and you can see a nice wooden
finish also I think it's made out of
ecological materials but completely
unprotected so the drivers there is no
protection for portable use maybe not
that great and it's two-way so two
woofers to Twitter's and as you can see
it has two ports at the side so it's
basically and the ports are a little bit
cooler here is later on also at the
front you can see there is some charging
port for external devices Auxiliary and
sound-wise yet quite hard to describe
but I think this is the most base every
speaker I've heard so far we can have a
look at some frequency response
measurements and here you can see that
back off reading tools lots of bass
boost also added peak at 75 Hertz here
this is the same as JBL Harman Kardon 75
Hertz peak but the JBL extreme which is
a pretty basic speaker as well it's a
notice boosted at the beggining to also
the Harman Kardon gunplay which is far
from flat suddenly measures more neutral
another pretty basically speaker is the
Billy 15 maybe
but even this doesn't has this strong
boosted one mode base so I would like to
show you how the back of reading tool
sounds we will compare it against their
hammer congruent players this is the
closest content I think JB extreme and
even docking defined cannot quite
complete is also quite a bit louder as
always I'll be using my pen or
microphones and the head cam i will try
using my user
camera now so I'm not sure if it works
out I think the image is a bit wobbly so
sorry for that but please put up your
headphones and let's check them out
as you can see I put them far away this
time so we can we list at eye level but
first let's turn it on and listen to
this timeline on yeah that voice from
far incredibly here obviously the
speaker is not really meant for
low-level listening I will show you why
I will play a track from so personal
that screams atresia and this is the
very first volume level yes you cannot
make it any software and this is already
quite loud for the comp listening there
is another problem yes delete some here
you may be heard default when they stop
here now and I will start music it will
start without fail yes now the bass is
back again I would call it may be some
kind of sluggish State the bass always
need some time to adjust to the actual
volume level from Stanford if I switch
over to my iPhone and back to the back
of rhythm
you know that laces break again this
also happens if you change volume
quickly the base has this strange
sluggish creaking character similar to
the Sony SRS X 55 preferred maybe that
these key is trying to keep the bass
always it mixing it but I will turn the
volume up somewhere else here's the
basic sometimes I'll expect a wasting
quickly
Oh
siganme
in all that they suspect here but you
can hear that it's just base and yeah an
effect here is it trains droning post
noise to complain of all also bass heavy
it sounds much more refined come home
after this one more day
then our the base and the base of
breathing again mouth
so the eclipses in my graph which it
always needs two sections of there's a
full basement spec again
all right Rick
the complaint if some shown apart from
home but not assuming overall here the
base is just so much come of it if you
see how the face started to ramp up
again some attract face from the
comportment already you can hear is well
here the country
perfect you can hear the port
already that's the advantage of
effectively the overall and those can
plus as well as we heard many commenters
complain about passing citizens are from
the gameplay told me this is more kind
of wasting yes
of course this left the whole
arrangement mixed message the fourth
noise Bugzilla taken to this may be
pathetic
really really let's call talking base
norm talking click on play it's like
this actor like that
it's like this it's like that kappa go
freedom to again actor like that it's
like this it's like that it's like this
like this like that it's like this it's
like that it's like this perfect on
somehow more convenient
Nemechek all they found like the
effective the conve has a nice comp this
person to the tightest well male I will
achieve volume slacking ad the goal
place well
I think this remains more consistent
with some final pivot base come back
again
yeah no then let this not acknowledge
maximum so not much happens during the
last the gunplay yes next within here
not much change in the upper volume
range but it appears quite different
this is another way for freedom to in
all the Flies Conclave has no chance
here we go no matter fact and you can
hear it because of the heavy bass book
at a normal level it still remains
cricket hole X maximum even more
balanced and before you complain if all
four planes Nexen 239
mom even although you can hear some
smaller compressions anything as well
and it's trying to be not affect here
America
15
you complain no sir but ringing somehow
more punches
Mulligan the place has nice kick but
just not a clock we could maybe try if
the male is even louder than they fee
for slow I put them closer to the wall
so this will increase basic more and I
will start again with that back offering
to playing at maximum
they also play the culprit to commuters
it does not compress or mimic from how
quality sport big of reading to again
you can hear sorry slightly
be false
okay more filling
you can definitely hear local
prospecting
and also definitely remain more true to
the original foundation at maximum I am
pretty sure every wheel base level is
definite love house of malice tuning for
the speaker but anyone serious about
music listening will probably run away
it's quite unpleasant to listen to
especially with normal music at high
volume there is so much bass this
booming one mode bass that it's not
really fun listening to it I notice it
becomes better yet basically seduced
somehow also quite loud nearly the
loudness of an area X is 9 in a much
smaller form factor but also a lot of
compression so it makes them you get
quite a bit of an over process sound
thing quite impressive although better
life is not that great at maximum I got
only 2 hours 30 out of it while the
Harman Kardon can play played for 2
hours 15 so both already not that great
for some outdoor party despite having
great sound but for example at oil boom
storm energy is close to 7 hours at
maximum yeah still a quite interesting
speaker it could be improved with some
slight bass reduction maybe but the Seas
and bass reflex port noise makes it
quite a bit yet let's say cheap so for
serious music listening the definitely
better speakers but it's quite a nice
boom-boom' box i would say what is this
voice prompts are horrible listen to
this i mean here we are it's just too
loud so you really cannot use it in a
violent environment i already included
it within my database so please check it
out interesting that during the rock
track at maximum the yeah she told me
that the battery was weak although it
was fully charged so you already get the
voice bump for weak battery after around
15-20 minutes although yeah it turned
off after 2 hours and 30 yes nothing
else to say I'm sure it will find its
fans and lovers for all those who love
this heavy boosted booming bass I'm not
that fan out of it for me it's a bit too
much but I'm sure many will definitely
like it let's put it back into this back
here and I hope you liked this video I
hope I could give you an idea about the
House of Mali
back off reading - not sure about the
old one I haven't heard it yet so I
don't know if this is an improvement or
if it became worse but yeah thanks for
watching and see you in the next video
have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
