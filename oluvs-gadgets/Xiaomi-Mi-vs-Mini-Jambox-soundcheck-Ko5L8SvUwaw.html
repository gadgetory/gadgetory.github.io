we'll compare that Xiaomi me against the
jawbone mini jambox yeah remember this
cost $200 some time ago
in the mean time yeah I think it's
discontinued but it still sold for
around hundred maybe and this is the
original this is the copy as we will see
but the copy is quite a bit better um
yeah I also wanted to tell you that I
have my second showing me and there are
some differences the first one I had was
from December 2015 not show feet visible
the new one is from July 2016 and the
issue I had with the old one was that it
distorted quite a bit at levels above
half the new one doesn't do this anymore
at least not to such a degree but at the
same time it sounds a little bit thinner
to tell the truth I yeah I prefer the
sound of the old one as it had this
fuller sound but I didn't like the
distortion the new one is in fact better
because it doesn't distort as much and
the sound is a little bit thinner but it
still sounds much better than anything
else like the JBL gold or JBL clip too
and everything also pretty loud as we
will see much louder than the gem box
mini jambox
and yeah before maybe having a listen
let's check out some frequency response
measurement you can see the mini jambox
at slightly elevated level so it doesn't
measure that badly at least better than
an ins n3 but at the same time you get
the strange to ever peak at around 12
kilo Hertz and bass are already starts
running off s 200 Hertz but there is
still some response below hundred Hertz
if we have a look at the Xiaomi me
compared you can see that some parts are
completely equal but the show me me
manages to keep more bass and the
frequency is overall much flatter
probably thanks to DSP and active
equalization maybe you have seen my
kitchen radio video where I have shown
how much is possible to tune a bed
speaker thanks to some equalizing and
DSP processing so the show me maybe has
even the same drivers as the mini jambox
but probably tuned a bit differently
thanks to some EQ if we have a look at
the lower level here with the mini
jambox you can see that there is not
much difference to before while the show
me me boots spaced slightly and you get
a much more full-bodied sound note at
higher levels this is the maximum volume
of the mini jambox here it's not very
loud in fact it's one of the maybe
softest speakers I've tried you can see
that it already reduced bass while there
show me me again keeps pace quite
I and the show Mimi plays even yet twice
as loud this is maybe 10 DB louder than
the mini jambox at maximum so as always
I would like to show you how these two
sound yeah there because you see that
the form factor is pretty similar it's
just a little bit longer
they even yea took the same fit it would
have been better to have the whole bass
rabbit as it really has to to be
standing on these feet otherwise it will
rattle both have only one passive
radiator here at the front so with bass
heavy tracks you get some some some
stronger vibration the job on mini
jambox doesn't vibrate as much because
yeah it doesn't have that much bass but
yeah let's have a listen as always of
course using binaural microphones and I
will start with the show-me me first and
then switch over the mini jambox so
please have a listen
yeah you can hear maybe that it sounds a
little bit if it was broken or something
Oh trees not for me so no it's flowing
chemistry is so just keep so a much more
mature song maybe another track and
let's increase volume slightly you can
see I am around two thirds maybe while
the mini jambox is already here playing
at maximum it cannot really quite
compute here yeah much fuller sound also
the switching from measurement letter
sounding without the strange gravity
this sounds really lenient
this is quite a heavy recording let's
reduce volume slightly and check how
they perform at lower levels we use
their mini jambox as well you can still
hear a much fuller sound coming from the
Sharmini may be another track I have to
increase volume although it's already
playing above half it's really really
soft so I will increase volume back to
normal and one feature the medium box
has is live audio this is some kind of
well steer enhancing I will turn this on
yeah now it really becomes quite
impressive sounding but unfortunate is
still pretty tinny you can hear the
guitar is coming somewhere from here
beside that show me well the show me
doesn't have this processing but it
still sounds fuller and somehow a little
bit more convincingly
so the mini jambox really shines because
of this life audio but we are already at
maximum
it became life audio pushes the volume
down slightly without doesn't have any
chance against the show me here with
another flag this recording has already
some enhanced stereo included so you can
also hear enhanced stereo situation from
the show me let's try the mini jambox
but will be no punch quite any
I will turn off light forever
that's where something else also here's
some nice stereo from the Shawnee
although no reprocessing here I have to
increase volume as their limiter kicks
in already here the yeah the gem box is
playing at maximum or one notch below
again my father lost even more loudness
now
although the spatial spatial sound is
really really impressive here
without my podium let's let's try
something else some house maybe so that
you show me is playing it round three
for the new gem box is maximum it
doesn't go any not this video and I'll
increase volume to maximum oh I think
you can hear that here difference is
really huge here I will reduce volume
again but even at low levels it simply
doesn't really impress that much yeah
the mini jambox has some advantages like
for example it can be paired with
another one for stereo what else mmm not
sure yeah it has multi pairing I think
it can connect to two devices at once
the Xiaomi me doesn't have these but it
has sdcard playback S Plus so also nice
I often have just a hard black diamond
and when I go hiking I listen music from
card because otherwise yeah my phone
would drain too much I really like the
show me me and although it's a copy it's
definitely a copy I mean I have seen
there are some images you can see it
naked it has exactly the same drivers so
I'm not sure how they really managed
maybe yeah thanks to some clever DSP
processing maybe the drivers are
slightly better and improved but you've
seen in the measurement there was some
part which was completely equal with the
mini jambox all the drivers have to have
some some similarity
but they made it way louder twice as
loud as the mini jambox and made it
sound simply much better the mini jambox
for $200 like it was at the very
beginning sorry
was hmm yeah I'm still a bit sick is
yeah completely overpriced it was really
I got it s refurbished why think fifty
sixty but it's not even worth this price
as you can get much better sound now
well below this so I hope this could
give you an idea about the show me it's
not some kind of Bose Soundlink mini
contender yet it's simply too small you
see it's little really pocket-sized but
in this size it's the best I've heard
also pretty loud now with this patch
revision let's say from July 2016 it's
definitely better not as full sounding
yeah we can maybe have a look at the
frequency response measurement I did of
both of the new and the old version so
you can see then you want here in black
and that one in gray so you see the old
one had slightly more bass below hundred
Hertz slightly more boosted bass except
from this not much has changed but this
probably helped to minimize distortion
and intermodulation at higher levels up
to let's say half volume the old one
sounded really nice could compete with
with much ladders because this one is a
little bit thinner now but I really
prefer it because the distortion is much
less so thanks a lot for watching I hope
this was helpful and yeah see you in the
next video until then have a nice time
and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
