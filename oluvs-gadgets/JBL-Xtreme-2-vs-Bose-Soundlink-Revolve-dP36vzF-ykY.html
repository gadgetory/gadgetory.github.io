going to do a quick comparison of the
new J big swing to against the Bose
Soundlink evolve plus there were many
requests to do this but you can always
check them out by yourself from my
database this should give you already a
first idea but still many people asking
to compare this with this and so on
although all speakers are included there
in nearly all of my videos I insert a
link to the database which is called
switcher yeah try it out compare the JBL
extreme tool to the JBL boom box to the
hammock on going play and so on I don't
own the Harman Kardon go and play
anymore therefore I cannot offer you
this comparison and I won't buy another
one I have the toy album store and G
which I think performs better and we
already did a comparison so I think we
have the JBL does a great job although
at higher levels it disappoints a little
bit but now to the boss yeah as you can
see it's a bit smaller also less than
half the weight and I don't think they
are really to be compared it's more
omnidirectional speaker so if you walk
around you still get the same sound well
this is rather a kind of boombox which
performs quite nicely although also
falls apart at high levels unless it
reduces bass too much and it's not as
loud although that bose may be can
compete loudness wise it compresses a
lot at Hallam's as we will hear but now
let's start with the first song and you
will immediately hear that the post is
in mmm-hmm let's say lower category I
will start with the JBL extreme first
and a kind of dance track
you can hear it sounds quite diffuse
also I notice we find without this punch
part here this is a completely different
sound
it appears even slightly softer not sure
I just don't have this this extreme
based on of course this changes when we
move around you can hear the sound
remains small is the same on the posed
by the JBL yeah I already lost all
treble and mid definition so that both
Emmett's the sound
remains here equally bad from all angles
while the JBL becomes great from formed
while rather bad from behind here that
Bo's cannot quite compete him now the
track and let's increase volume we are
at half so maybe 2/3
the pose still sounds a bit more
multimedia again when I move around
the oppose remains normal sounding
positive this strong base I will use
volume again to around half maybe and
like this yeah it doesn't have any
chance against the JBL let's try this
track one is that if you are outdoors
with your friends you will mostly
listening of exes so the sound will
change depending on your position to the
speaker I mean you are not able to put
it in exactly in front of you if you are
around with 1015 people so this is where
the TV a lot of fails I can hear like
this sound just yeah an emic if you
somehow without base without I mean a
space but not as deep as the GBO
this sounds wait my tits are way more
mature now track
bending on where I sit now the JBL
starts sounding strange if I sit like
this so just another category of speaker
there is no sweet spot we act with the
JBL that's right this right
in here I really have to is like this
so that it has an advantage yeah Patrick
the nice thing is that we have a post
sounds equally bad from all angles while
the JDL sounds really bad from behind
and really great from forum
so I mean please volume again we are
still around half the polls as well
and as soon as I go to the side here JBL
the pulse mode that great at Highbury
here the face is much nicer from the
Trivium
this just from a base on me
it's our district and have increased
wanting to make some so you can hear the
difference in loudness or the JBL
not really dead loud maybe they also
even louder but to hear result
is that some compressed sausage of salt
and it's a clowder
I will have to reduce many three notches
to make it reasonable now it's okay I
would say equally loud but not as deep
sounding the trade
so here for high levels it fails it's
rather great at low levels and this is
what I like the boss is owed to us in
the garden so I can listen to music
while walking around to the pool so
maybe let's take them and get out for
the garden so I can demonstrate you how
they sound there let's put them here to
the pool and I will start again with the
JBL it is slightly lower level not to
disturb the neighbors and you can hear
yeah like this the sound is rather bad
so I would have to go to the front again
so from inside the pool it would sound
ok while with the boss it doesn't matter
so I can walk around here lay down and
still get a nice sound why the JBL would
have to be turned around all the time or
you will take a JBL fit for and connect
them for cable connect plus
so how does this refinement of sound is
maybe not as important as indoors as
there is so much ambient noise so you
can hear that there Bose does quite a
great job here while the JBL only image
to the front again so you will have to
turn it around all the time still sounds
better but the difference is not that
huge anymore here the goddess of
listening angle it always sounds the
same may not attract still has this nice
bass kick here but also has not have
this maybe if you listen close closely
our sitting English closely listen
closely sounds strange
can hear way nicer yeah but again as
soon as I moved there - I don't know cut
some plants maybe so they pose still
sounds normal so I'll increase volume
around two-thirds again just a pose
you hear the difference becomes way less
noticeable if you're out to us with some
noise traffic birds and everything else
although it sounds definitely better
maybe this right you can see I have to
be small on axis to really get the best
best sound
the post only competes if the whole
sound energy is taken into account
so let's get back in to us and yeah I
give you my short resume so that JBL
definitely shines for more critical
listening although it was not designed
for this it was rather designed to be an
auto boom box and then it loses when you
are not listening exactly on axis the
boss on the other hand yeah it was maybe
designed more for critical listening but
it fails completely here the sound is
rather mushy but it is gonna hear at low
levels it boosts bass more so it gives
you a more appealing a warmer sound the
GBL can sometimes appear especially
autos at low levels it appears as a big
thing it hasn't boost bass it has
slightly boosted bass but it doesn't
boost it more for low levels so the boss
might appear even warmer if you take it
to your terrace and Petzi impatient how
do you say it in English so I think yeah
for the same price mmm it's way
overpriced $2.99 $2.99 and in the
meantime you can maybe get it for
cheaper but if you really are after
sound quality yeah the table extreme too
is way better but it depends on the on
the intended use I mean when I take you
to the pool when I'm inside outside I
would have to turn it around all the
time so for this task I really prefer
the pose maybe even connect it to
another one for stereo here you could
maybe for the peg side use a flip for or
rather not the charge tree has it sounds
muddy on its own so yeah I hope this
could give you an idea just on sound
alone the JBL blows the boss away it's
just one sing a full range driver which
gets reflected inside with two Percy
freighters this is a two-way system with
dedicated Twitter's still I think they
could have added maybe a Twitter at the
back maybe also switchable one so that
you can define do you want more on
directional sound and switch on the back
Twitter
I mean I'm not sure then the infinity
one already had beg drivers but they
were filtered for travel so it was not a
full-on erection sound just they emitted
only meats and bass maybe they could
have done the same here but with a with
an own Twitter I'm not sure I really
prefer a more omnidirectional sound for
speakers especially when I'm when I'm
using them outdoors but yeah so yeah I
hope you like this video and see you in
the next one
have a nice time and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
