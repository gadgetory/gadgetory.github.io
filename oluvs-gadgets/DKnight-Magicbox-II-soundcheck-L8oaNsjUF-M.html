tool recently I was contacted by them if
I was interested in reviewing it and
when looking at Amazon you can see there
are lots of raving reviews nearly seven
thousand five hundred customer reviews
most of them five or four stars of
course I was interested this is already
the second generation so with more
output power it says here 10 watts with
enhanced base and it goes for $33 I have
quite a similar speaker this is called
Mir Tech but in America I think it goes
as sound pot they look pretty similar so
I think this is really the same speaker
just with a different brand so I thought
we'll compare how these two sound if the
denied is really that much better as you
can see this is the packaging not much
inside just some wires and manual and
design was also quite similar with this
typical jam box patterns here not sure
why they have to choose these patterns I
find them quite cheesy the military has
their passive rated at the front the
magic box tool has it at the back quite
a bit larger also at the top we can see
similar controls and of course I
measured both so when looking at the
frequency response measurement of both
you can see that there is not that much
difference they both seem to be based on
really the same design with base role of
already at 200 Hertz I mean the base
doesn't roll off that steep so you get
some nice lower base response but you
have to put it in a corner or towards
the wall or something so yeah let's turn
it on and as always I'm losing my neural
microphones so you should listen
headphones and we will start with a song
and the magic box to first so please
have a listen
the mythic and yes place sounds more
less the same there is some slight
difference but I couldn't say which one
sounds better as they sound simply too
similar Lily another track
French hip-hop Punk
I'm your tech again there really isn't
that much difference something else
maybe more electronic but I think you
can get it both sound rather tinny this
is the typical song to get for 2030
dollars so I cannot hear any hands face
the matrix on just the same maybe let's
put them right away
and increase volume slightly both
vibrate by the way so I hope they will
stand stable and I will increase volume
this is the magic box for now playing at
maximum now the mere tech also makes a
noise when you can hear slightly
enhanced bass response but still
quite cleaning yeah maybe the magic box
is slightly louder let's try not attract
the mythic software
another mythic again yeah me they sound
similar no magic backs again it's
slightly louder but the sound is not
that much different maybe let's try the
new Xiaomi me I really up just before as
this cause just the same I mean you can
find it for $35 so let's turn this off
here let's put the shower me beside so
so quite a bit more pocketable so we
will hear how these two sound compared
and I will reduce or enhance the volume
slightly on the magic box and let's try
another track and let's have a listen to
both
let's increase volume slightly this is
the magic box - no no Vinnie yeah and
here you can hear finally pace I mean
this is what I call pace while here
basis rather missing maybe let's check
lower levels as not everyone always
cranks the speaker for maximum I think
the difference is more than obvious so
let's put them away again and let's
crank may be open for maximum let's also
vibrate slightly but maybe not as much
as the magic box so let's increase
volume for maximum and maybe another
track
they can already hear vibration from the
low board there s it's like is it
vibrate so much let's try the me also
maximum it's not quite reasonable there
is too much vibration going on in us
right
and this table again and they can mix in
there
then again slightly less full-bodied
also slightly softer maybe but this
already distorts quite quite a lot so
I'm not sure for general use I mean both
don't sound great at maximum but for
general use
I would definitely prefer the me here so
I'm not sure if this D night is really
that great is all the videos suggesting
I mean it's how small is the same as the
old Mir tech I already have more than
one year I think so I don't see that
much improvement if there was I mean
you've heard at maximum it was quite a
bit more full but it may be then there
me so if they adjusted the Sun
dynamically with some more dynamic bass
boost at low levels it could maybe shine
but currently it doesn't really it
sounds still quite teeny comparable to
the sound core from anchor maybe even
slightly worse so yeah I'm not really
impressed like this this is the denied
yeah you really look more less the same
very jambox like design all seem to have
yeah taking a bit of inspiration while
this is also gem box like mini jambox
but looks much better than the original
so this is a better copy of the original
while these are more or less copies the
other copies but I think at low levels
the gem box sounds better than this so
if you don't if you rather meet Lola
with the original gem box is I think a
bit more food but it's something this
although this is much much better so
yeah not a too great speaker but nothing
really bad either
but for the same price I would
definitely go for the me here so thanks
a lot for watching I hope this was
helpful thanks to the night for the
sample
unfortunally I'm not really that
impressed you have to work a bit further
to make the speaker really appealing
yeah so let's see the third generation
until then have a nice time and bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
