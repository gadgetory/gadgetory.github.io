according to my son these are two big
bombas a very big mega Pumbaa and a big
still quite heavy big bomba this is the
IVA XS nine and the Brookstone big blow
party we've already heard these speakers
in my short preview video but the
acoustics was pretty bad there with lots
of reverb and I thought we will repeat
the test again to see which one can play
louder which one sounds simply better
and so on which is more powerful I mean
both speakers are quite heavy this one
has close to 6 kilograms this has close
to five point five kilograms so even if
this is smaller this is not a speaker
for the rucksack anymore yeah it will
kill it if you have to carry it for a
longer time this costs $2.99 this is
$1.99 although it's reduced it was also
29 at the beginning yeah as always I
will of course use my banal microphones
so please put up your headphones for the
best results this time I will play some
tracks from sole personas new album that
was just released called momentum
check it out on you iTunes on Amazon on
Bandcamp it's really a great album so
yeah please put up your headphones and
the fun I will turn off the volume to
maximum on the big blue party also
increase base some notches just to get
you to get the most out of it
I think the biggest difference between
these two speakers is that their big
blue party is a 360-degree speaker I
mean this is quite nice to fill the
space but half of the sound always gets
lost backwards
therefore it probably won't appear as
lot we will check this out I will start
with the big blue party and the song
called riding time have a listen
not that much difference well sure
because the IVA is still far from
maximum I will turn it up to maximum as
well now yeah now the big blue party
sounds a bit lost here
and the Bluetooth bridge is also quite
bad on the Cape flu you know of course
no treble from the I bite the back but
it's not a omnidirectional special of
the little party unfortunately I cannot
go that far away because the Liberal
Party will lose the local connection
let's try another track this is called
quantum interlude featuring Carl Hudson
on keyboards also check out Kyle
Hudson's great album kind of space jazz
funk called
solo G for merchants merchants
is the big blue party no maximum volume
I mean the difference is night and day
regarding loudness and everything sounds
a bit wash no imagine a second IVA XS 9
connected for a wireless stereo set
apart some makers and yeah you
definitely have a kind of outdoor disco
this is simply no comparison anymore
we're losing Google connection and I
come a bit closer let's try another
track again princess freeze your own
vocals track is called Open Sesame
so person√≠s master rings are very bad so
they bring every speaker to its limits
if you crank them to maximum but I can
still feel the base some missiles away
this is impressive with the IRA exercise
I'm not sure if it does make sense to
get indoors and have a listen yeah let's
try as you can see I had to set them up
on separate tables because the aya is so
big the big blue party is playing at six
out of nine and bass and treble is
neutral I'm starting with the big blue
party again and the track called our
kind
big blue body sounds a bit thin let's
try it with a bit more punch maybe four
out of five
yeah it still have much more punchy
sound from the Iver let's try another
trick
yeah I think it doesn't quite make sense
to compare they're simply much more
different sounding the AIA is a much
more powerful and much more refined
sounding speaker still the Brookstone is
not bad but it's simply it doesn't
compare okay guys thanks for watching
just as a teaser I have audio Pro ad on
tv3 neck coming next is this a Swedish
speaker pretty nice sounding very fine
refined sound not very loud but really
really nice and stay tuned for seeing
this in my next video until then have a
nice time I hope it was helpful and yeah
see you then bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
