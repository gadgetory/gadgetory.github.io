immediately asking compare the diamond
box against the JBL boom box so I asked
my friend if I could have his JBL boom
box for some days I came out here
although it's a bit windy I hope this
won't disturb us that much but I cannot
keep it for that long maybe I will also
manage an indoor comparison later on as
I think they are quite comparable so
weight is small is equal I put both on
the scale in each hold 5.3 kilograms
maybe it's not that precise but also
price is comparable so that JBL boom box
in the US cause I think $450 the diamond
box with the small battery 550 and I
think if you are after maximum loudness
maximum power while still keeping it
small yeah the diamond box is the way to
go as we were here
yeah please pull up your headphones as
this is a binaural recording and let's
check them out volume is around 2/3 so
both under start with the diamond box
and some more funky stuff
you may be noticed as much when choices
on bass and treble so nice are somehow
scooped out
again it sounds more neutral maybe
should be too much presence post maybe
also more boy in common
try this
it's a bit strange
especially when I increase volume mr.
zombie comes in and you know
without books
sublimating is noticeable of surveil
outer remains powerful for maximum
the boombox becomes the kitchen box
movie
that's right is I'm 50 meters away no
you may notice that it's not hard to say
it anymore so I will release one maybe
three notches
GBL it sounds really strange as somewhat
based on travel and everything in
between is missing
so let's increase warning again
this is a joke he tries to be a boombox
part
it's all your father influences -
perfect right for a windy day like this
I try to hide myself here into the
forest but from 20 meters away you
hardly can do it anymore
we are not just we don't make
if you notice it doesn't try to push
bass in any way mix with him
this is a bit dirty but still reusable
one of this yet not that so noisy from
taking two solos
I'm seasoning let's see how I can get
here
ready meet the small you can hear the
boss is still terrible well
something else also very punch even from
this defense we have 30 meters away
you cannot even hear the bass anymore
only thing we could try is and it'll
auto if this improves a little bit
I personally definitely prefer not much
difference
books and this is night and day
pretty much I'm 20 meters away no it's
still very loud while yeah the GPL is
appa-snot
have to come closer like this to hit him
in alone
not even compelling
and meet zaheer but no I think you would
hear without doubt the diamond box model
M is way more powerful way louder than
the JBL boombox although at maximum with
some particular tricks there was some
slight distortion but turn volume down
two notches and it should be fine while
still being the order and simply
sounding heavier than the JBL boombox
and maximum the JBL boombox becomes
really a joke so it's more usable up to
60 70 percent but for really being loud
yeah it's not the best speaker so I
think that the diamond box is way better
here also keep in mind this is a four
man company while JBL Harman Kardon
Samsung I mean is a huge company and
they cannot bring out anything decent so
I'm really quite impressed and for
anyone longing for the loudest while
still quite portable speaker currently
the diamond box model M seems to be the
only one it's about as loud as the model
and from what I've heard Harvey compared
this tool so yeah I'm really really
impressed yeah I hope you liked this
little comparison here yeah I hope this
could give you an idea about the
difference in loudest and power I hope I
can also compare them indoors
although I have to bring it back in some
days not sure how much time I will have
otherwise to check them out to my
database yeah thanks a lot for watching
have a nice time and
you
my name is around two-thirds were both
inter start with the diamond box some
more funky stuff
Rodolphe Nunez medical settings where I
am lost
Victor who are they
so the diamond box has definitely
Athleta tuning maybe also more boring
for some or so in cash like the JBL
communaut√© is much more emphasis on base
on travel but somehow the meat sauce oh
yeah yeah gates on gates on
she said something showing absolute me
act so lot is this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
