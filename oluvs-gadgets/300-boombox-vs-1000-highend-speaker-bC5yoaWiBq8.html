NASA was quite interesting also quite
revealing without knowing which because
actually plane it's not easy to say
which one is better or so depending a
lot which headphone use for monitoring
I'm still getting comments like I'm
listening this for my J bit extreme this
is of course fail it's a Pandora
recording made well and artificial head
so you need a decent pair of headphones
but when looking for some comments it
seems as if the major part preferred
speaker a while some others profits pick
a P and I would like to repeat this test
again
and let you listen this I'm actually
showing two speakers playing and at the
end of every track I will play the
original recording for you as reference
so that you know which one is really
closer to the original source so let's
listen again I would also let my son
listen and at the end he will tell us
what when he preferred so
how
waking up to a green world
yeah rich flipping off the board never
have to just wanting more I want people
like check it out how to go about how
the move out the twist is like an easy
to province or jacket undercover folk
soldier here ain't anywhere
so yeah speaker a was indeed the Iowa
and I think many could hear that it's
the clearer one the clear are something
on although still many community that
their name sounds clear which is not
quite true they have the megaphone so my
cell also preferred the Iowa because I
think that IRA is indeed closer to the
original source but also here it and I
will show you some measurements here in
black the name you saw and in blue that
our exes name and you can see that the
name has this strange trying to pick at
eight kilo Hertz also some deep bass or
it also below her it hurts although it
has some response down to 30 Hertz the
Iowa is able to retain more bass down to
60 verse let's say and the our response
is simply smoother and flatter so keep
in mind we were comparing a low budget
$300 speaker to discover talent more
expensive yeah I recommend really
everyone and the owner of the Iowa to
have a look at the Z and J designs I
Burbank which cost about $110 currently
only in America and I think it's
definitely worth it makes the Iowa a
really funky looking speaker the name in
my opinion is a huge disappointment for
this price thousand dollars it sounds
just underwhelming it's beaten easily by
my dad I mean still many claims be
sounds better for me it doesn't it lacks
any definition the frequency response is
off there is too much mid response while
lacking any base definition so in this
case that ever being the bottom unit is
their way my more impressive speaker so
I think I could or I hope I could
conclude the topic name user being a
heads because I'm not sure it's not
high-end
it's simply it has a high-end price but
the speaker itself is rather
disappointment to tell the truth while I
still I'm getting impressed with the
high bar after three or four years after
release it still hardly it has had any
competition in this price range won't
the sucks to have to testify
bakemax lasagna yet my son likes the
look maybe because the drivers are
visible so the name user will be sold
thanks to all for watching for joining
I hope the revealing didn't you too
much but in my opinion both were maybe
not perfect but a speaker a having a
more direct a clearer sound definitely
gave the more convincing result so
thanks for watching and see you the next
video have a nice time bye bye
hi so thanks for participating
hi so I think that blind listening this
was quite was most quite was high so I
think that blind listening like hi
so I think the blind listening test was
quite interesting without my which speak
I was actually playing I think the bias
was held high so I think they blindly
sing the listening hi
so I think the blind listen test from
last time was quite interesting without
knowing which speakers actually played
with which is Peter Eastern chose the
faster if you say well II was a shock
Alexander as a become says he can
imagine yeah hi
so I think the blind isn't is from last
time was quite interesting especially
without knowing which becomes actually
playing it's hard it's quite what system
do sticks was he sad yeah hi so I think
that last I was definitely worth but we
can take and post on come hi so I think
the blank isn't is from last time was
quite interesting especially without
knowing which because actually playing
it's quite hard to have to so speaker a
was the Iowa and speaker be Isola
so much way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
