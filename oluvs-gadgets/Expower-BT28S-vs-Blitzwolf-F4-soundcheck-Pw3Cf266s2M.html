going to have a look at another
look-alike to the Blitz wolf f4 and also
easyacc we've heard before but this time
it comes from xpower it's currently
available on Amazon for 53 dollars
so quite a bit cheaper than the Blitz
wolf and it's about in white and black
so I think in white it looks really cool
also this brushed aluminum look makes it
quite premium the Bliss wolf has it as
well but it's not as visible and here
it's black so doesn't really give the
impression of some aluminium and even
the packaging is much more premium than
from the others so you can see they
really designed it nicely not much
inside just some wires manual and so on
but feature wise the X power has also
the edge you can see it has a micro SD
playback also NFC this one doesn't seem
to have NFC although for iOS users it's
not really usable at all and I thought
we'll have a listen how it sounds and
how these two compare if they still
sound the same so I will turn it on yeah
you get again this strange tones but you
can suppress them when pressing play or
em button during powering on so at least
yeah this works let's turn on the
Bluetooth as well
and as always I'm of course using
binaural microphones so you should
listen fat phones I will play some tunes
to get an idea which one sounds better
and so on I will start with a tune from
princess freesia
and the X power first so please have a
listen and I think you can hear it it
sounds a bit more covered the X power
has a more open sound and less boney
sound little again it doesn't have this
nice treble response of the X power
maybe let's try it
backtrack the diesel you can hear some
stronger upper base post and trevally
quite a bit more assess something else
is some dance track
you
and I think the Expo deputy sounds
better that base has some more
controlled sound to it
maybe some house little and now let's
see what happens when we decrease volume
here we are about half already so I will
turn it down below half on the X power
as well and you can maybe hear the X bar
becomes more teeny sounding why the
Blitz wolf keeps this level I will
reduce volume even more so for some kind
of background hissing and yeah I think
it's quite noticeable here this still
sound has this full bodied sound why the
X power becomes quite a bit tinny
sounding so why is this maybe let's have
some look at a frequency response
measurement of both and you can see the
X power has a slightly flatter and more
even frequency response the blitzwolfer
has this upper bass boost and also
treble rolls off earlier but when
looking at some further volume steps at
lower levels you can see that the blitz
wolf boost space for low levels to
compensate for human loudness contours
while the X power doesn't do this so it
always plays the same except at high
levels there is some bass reduction but
you don't get this typical loudness
which makes the speakers sound yeah that
Pleasant at low levels which is of
course a pity because it sounds great at
levels above half and also at maximum we
will see later on but at low levels it
doesn't give you this really full-bodied
sound of the of the others so it will
definitely sound more teeny even than
the small Xiaomi me speaker although it
sounds great and I even prefer it over
the vibe of 120
it would get along with some some
loudness I contacted them why what's
what's the matter and so on and they
told me that the result an app available
where you can yeah where you can do some
things and there is indeed an app but
the app let's see if we are connected
yeah and now we have some settings here
we have a bass boost I hope you can see
this a treble boost a parametric
equalizer dynamic range control these
two EQ enhanced and subsided don't do
anywhere advanced yeah they don't work I
mean I cannot see any difference and if
we listen to another track from cap yak
for example the only thing there this is
with a head turned off completely we can
turn off the bass post travels or the
parametric equalizer but of course I
would leave them on still there is no
loudness so you cannot turn loudness on
which is of course a pity but
interesting is this dynamic range
control which starts to compress
dynamics at high levels and prevents
Distortion something the roots wolf
doesn't have self at maximum volume that
little will distort more while this will
become more controlled sounding maybe
let's try
Oh
that blitz wolf and try to match one
assailant
maybe a trek from sulpice another girl
princess pooja listen to the base from
here let's increase them to maximum i
will go far away this is the plates
worth now and increase the volume to
maximum on the expo as well and you can
maybe hear that the X power
sounds cleaner I will start the F again
and let's turn off dynamic control the
end you hear what happens
maybe that's reduced writing slightly so
we can try it completely without a peg
which of course all of our playing is
maximum by the way but without effect
it's not really that listenable not
right still both as maximum
yes maybe slightly louder due to less
compression but this sounds somehow more
controlled
it's slightly louder but also a bit more
distorted I will say the X power
compresses more and I mean it's great
that you have the option to turn off
effects completely although I'm not sure
why I would like to do this yeah I mean
it sounds pretty pretty horrible without
effects just like all the other speakers
that don't have DSP included but I will
reduce volume also one point you have to
know is crank the speaker to maximum and
control volume from your player
otherwise if you max out the player and
control volume from here you will lose
some bass I also try to measure it and
it's visible you get more than 5 DB bass
loss like this but I will have to reduce
volume a little bit in order to use the
SD card playback s you also have the
option to I think it goes in like that
yeah and you have all tracks just like
we had on the on the ice sound pan I'm
still quite bright man I maybe it's
better visible like that and we can
switch between tracks from here and of
course also control volume from here
remotely so the speaker is not playing
from this D card and I can control
volume
I can switch between threads from my
phone
which is of course nice I mean you don't
get annoyed to to bug you don't get
folders when when you have the music
inside folders it just becomes a whole
list but still it's pretty nice so
feature wise definitely the most
advanced model also sound wise it would
be the best let's turn down volume again
this is in sync by the way so it doesn't
show you but hold volumes if I reduce
volume here uh I'm also reduced here so
it's definitely the most advanced model
out of these also because you can turn
off DSP if want it you have sdcard
playback NFC I'm not sure if this one
really has any see it's really not
written anywhere anything cheaper than
applets all the only thing that prevents
me of giving it a highly recommended
because it's really great I mean better
sounding and this more controlled it
never distorts if you keep on this
dynamic range control enabled it doesn't
really stop but I'm missing this
loudness compensation for low level set
low levels it sounds just like many
others like like if I can anchor sound
guy of course a bit better as the base
which is much deeper but still it misses
this slide base emphasis which is
important for the human year as it low
levels it just yeah it's much less
sensitive to low frequencies otherwise a
really great speaker and for $33 I would
take it probably over the above 120 it's
louder it does not distort like they've
about 128 the battery is pretty strong
you get around five hours at maximum
while the love of room reduces volume
after one hour so one and a half and and
it cannot really play at maximum so this
is definitely a better speaker also nice
nice design although it would have been
maybe better without this visible
although you can see it here as well so
the expo is definitely recommended if
you don't need
low level listening or have other
speakers yet go for it
I think I prefer it quite a bit more
over there blitz wolf as it has nice a
treble also the bass reaches deeper but
it's not as booming and but
unfortunately for low levels there are
better speakers out there so I hope this
was helpful give you an idea about the X
power
it's another look-alike a clone in
reality the it's from wicking or hiking
I don't know a some Chinese company who
which probably produces all of them
including their their easyacc it would
be great to have one with all the
features from the X power but also
loudness this would be a dream speaker
for the price of the X power and this
would be really killer I mean you cannot
really expect more so let's see maybe
some other company comes up with the
same one but all the features including
DSP processing and and the better tuning
I think this is really tuned better than
they please wolf this is too much upper
bass and the treble is not as smooth as
from the exponent but who knows so maybe
let's wait until the perfect one comes
out until then yeah stay tuned and see
you in the next video thanks for
watching and bye bye
just a short addendum for all those
frequency response graph phonetics it
would be definitely interesting to see
how the X power measures completely with
DSP processing disabled and you can see
a measurement in black with DSP enabled
and in red with DSP completely disabled
so the frequency response you get is
typical for all those speakers around
forty fifty dollars which yeah have no
DSP so you see some bass roll-off at 200
Hertz so what the DSP does here is with
bass boost you boost bass you can see in
the measurement that the bass gets
boosted with treble you boost treble
slightly then there is also a parametric
equalizer which evens the frequency
response slightly out and this is the
result which you will get when all
parameters are enabled if let's sound
for all volume levels
this shows the necessity of DSP
processing for such smooth because most
because still don't have any DSP
included therefore you get tinny sound
most all the time just that maximum they
tend to sound a bit fuller but at normal
listening levels these small drivers
cannot produce enough bass on their own
so they need some help from from some
bass post dynamic bass boost in the DSP
has to control the right amount for any
loudness level therefore it's really
important for such small speakers to
include DSP it shows also how more
advanced the show-me miss because sounds
compared to many other large us because
they don't have DSP is the xiaomi has
processing which keeps the bass level
high all the time and yes this is the
biggest advantage
otherwise if all tuning is done probably
her
yeah with with with an electronic
equalizer internally with the within the
DSP and also another measurement i
wanted to show you in red you see when
the speaker is maxed out with the volume
control on the on the player around half
and the blue you can see with the player
maxed out and the speaker around half
volume you can see that there is a bass
loss which shouldn't be usually the DSP
should control the input gain and
automatically just a level in this case
it does not quite work the blitz wolf
don't have doesn't have this problem the
X power obviously needs to be mixed out
all the time it also it seems to have a
slightly less hiss than the blitz wolf
if you mix out the bits of the history
is increased so there are some
differences between these speakers just
wanted to show you some photographs
which I forgot a little bit so thanks
again and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
