time for some Auto Party with such a
wonderful atmosphere I thought I'll come
out and we will test the new clips
groove again how it compares how it
sounds outdoors
I brought some speakers with me the JBL
charge too you can also see the JBL
extreme already here I also have the
flip three this is a pretty loud speaker
not very bass heavy but definitely
louder than the JBL so it would be
interesting to compare how it sounds
against the clips groove here is the
wonderful clips groove and I also
brought the mini Eric also quite a loud
speaker pretty clean sound so who will
have a listen how all these compare you
know not everyone is willing to carry
around such huge boom boxes but when you
are out with friends who want to have
some music the speaker has to be small
loud and maybe have some bass so it's
really hard to find a nice compromise
and I think the clips groove is such a
compromise it sounds pretty nice at low
levels we've already heard it in my
previous video but it can also play loud
and it's still well not bass heavy but
it's still quite punchy especially
compared against such speakers like the
flip free or the UE boom and so on
so I thought we'll compare all these I
have prepared three songs and we will
have a listen
as always I'm wearing my binaural
microphones and a head cam so please
listen with headphones as binaural
recordings require headphones for best
results
put them up and yeah let's have a listen
unfortunately there is a bit of wind
today but I hope we can listen anyhow I
start comparing the clips groove with
the JBL charge tool and both will be
playing at maximum
and I'll start first with the clips
let's have a listen
yeah you can maybe hear already some
slight distortion a JBL
it is really maximum volume it doesn't
go any louder and then it sounds clean
and full-bodied but simply not very loud
which again
yeah there's quite a difference I'll
step father back let's write us home
let's see how far we can t run the table
is already fading a bit
yeah it's louder but I think you can
hear that it's not very clean anymore
and the Bluetooth which is also starting
to yeah interrupts jdl again there start
something with ridiculous
I got a song
there is more from the side
TV oh yeah this is night and day
regarding loudness
but I think you can hear that they're
clips these thoughts pretty badly
already
now let's have a listen to the JBL flip
3 instead I will set it up upright so
both are more or less mono the JBL flip
3 can play definitely in order than the
JBL charge 2 but not a space heavy
especially not at maximum volume I'll
start again with the clip let's have a
listen
movement the equal loudness but it's far
not as full-bodied it's not sounding a
bit like a toy compared to their lips go
let's listen phonetic the loudest lies
not that much difference but they
clipped recently much more reproduce
this sounds somehow fuller more powerful
last song
another bad speaker $4.99 but yes a bit
Croatia now unfortunately distortion of
the clips well is not very satisfying
here the wind is a bit annoying as well
I'll come closer
now let's try the mini record this
compares against the clips groove both
are playing at maximum as always and
again clips groove first to be even
louder maybe not as free body but you
know pretty punchy definitely better
than the clips free
but the clips already distorts let's
listen to the track
there's this louder for sure I'll go
back father
which roof again it has slightly more
bass
but if the sports more not that much
difference from some distance a nice
feature of the mini Eric is that you can
daisy-chain it with other minerals this
way you can make a kind of chain with
maybe up mm but of course I can also
connect it to the clips groove through
auxilary and I thought we will check out
if these two when played at maximum can
compete loudness wise to the JBL extreme
of course the they won't have any chance
regarding bass and so on but maybe
simply on loudness alone they may have a
chance
so first mini Eric and clips groove
together and then I'll switch over to
their table extreme let's have a listen
they're the extreme stones much fuller
loudness wide
yeah of excess it starts moving a bit
so simply on loudness the difference is
not a truth between two between these
two but of course the JBL sounds much
cooler with more bass so yeah for
outdoors the JBL charge 2 is definitely
not the loudest and best speaker we've
heard that the flip 3 was louder
although a bit tinny sounding the best
so far are definitely the clip roof and
demeanor eek the clip
sounds a bit fuller but distorts quite a
bit that makes him volume you really
have to bring it some notches down the
mini Ric plays completely clean without
any Distortion
it doesn't have as much bass but yet the
sound is still pretty impressive but now
the JBL charge 3 was already announced
it's a bit bigger than the charge 2
looks a bit like some kind of mini JBL
extreme so maybe this will change again
everything I hope I can get my hands
some on one and we will have a listen to
the JBL charge 3 then until then yeah
have a nice time and enjoy the rest of
the winter thanks for watching and bye
bye
