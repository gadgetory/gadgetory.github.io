talking about the automatic ef4 XR the
top model in automatics in a lineup
which is cos available SS version the XL
version costs currently $300 the SL
version 350 and the biggest difference
is based XR stands for extended response
and it has slightly more bass or more
elevated bass I personally think that
this is closer to a normal sound or
let's say the Hammond target why the SL
version of off letter also drops off too
much with bass so it sounds colder
somehow more analytical but I personally
I prefer a bit more bass although this
is still not a bass heavy Indian
although it depends a lot on the tips
and today I would like to yet to answer
the question if it's really the same as
the 3xr this was my first one automatic
not the very first one was the mk5
and that I thought yeah I want to hear I
want to his step up the 3xr is $150 so
half the price of the ef4 XR and I
wanted to know is it really worth double
the price is it that much better
I want the top model let's say and I was
a little torn should I take the normal
version or the extended response version
I hear I had both I had the XR and the s
in this case it's called studio edition
not studio reference or whatever I
compared back and forth and I prefer the
XL version although the studio edition
with bigger tips because the tips
influence the sound also how deep you
managed to get an inside so with the big
tips
the XL version was too booming for me
it's somehow yeah the sound was quite
fat but is a version on the other hand
even with the big tips was still not I
don't know I'm not quite sure so I stuck
at the Excel version and got the 4 x RL
and what I can tell you although there
are many claims it's still it's the same
in here it's not the same just that the
quality control is better for the for
it's not quite true because just on the
fact alone that it has a different
impedance the ER for XR has 45 ohms
while this head
to also have the impedance and only this
effect the sound because the output
impedance of your source or the
influences the sound so it changes the
amount of travel after having had the
you have three example maybe three
months four months nearly half a year
and yeah I got used to the sound and
found it's a little bit yeah covered
let's say yeah although it's really
clear in it sounded covered to me and
then John Young suggested to try some
impedance adapter I tried several ones
this one has 30 ohms
I tried 80 ohms hundred fifty ohms the
one with hundred fifty was reduced
volume to match so on the iPhone I had
to increase volume nearly at maximum to
get an adequate volume so I compared
back and forth and stuck with the 31
Holmes adapter so when used like this
the sound becomes fdt clearer this
sounds still clearer then the ER 3 XR
with adapter so you would need even a
higher output impedance for example when
played from a PC the ER 3 XR is already
quite close to the response of the EF 4
XR when played from from an iPhone so in
my case yeah the double price was that
me worth it because I don't have to
hassle around with with with an adapter
but the ER for exam higher impedance
output sounds already too harsh so that
the tremor becomes too boosted before
talking well I will demonstrate you some
sound samples which were not that easy
to record let's cover this later let's
look at the packaging here the e 3 XR
has just this little pouch comes with
additional tips but only one pair so
this these are the smaller ones a pair
of bigger ones or so for miss forget the
phoniest there are people who claim that
they get a good sound oh the phone is
impossible I cannot even put them that
deep inside
they they really need the three flange
some college Christmas tree tips also
comes with with additional filters also
the filter removing pool the same for
the er4 XR justice it has an additional
pouch and twice the tips so you get to
put this away here so two tips of the
bigger ones two pairs of the smaller
ones it slides out like this also get
this certificate which shows you that
drivers are matched with in how much do
I have here
I don't know - plus I kind of but you
can see that that the drivers are
matched with in maybe half a DB or
whatever or one DB and you get this big
carrying pouch together with the smaller
one so quite nice and everything else is
the same just that you get two filters
additional filters and twice the tips so
we can put this away as well and let's
concentrate on the in is its themselves
look more is the same so the design is
really equal just that the ER for XR
comes with a longer cable yeah I noticed
it immediately because I think this one
is already long enough so when when when
take bacon like this you can see the the
ER for XR is about maybe 20 centimeters
longer apart from that seal fit is
everything the same the biggest
difference is definitely this output
impedance which affects the sound so I
cut at the beginning I started with
their smaller tips and now I'm using the
bigger ones and when I put it inside so
let's make it like shown in the
instruction video you see they
completely disappear inside my ear so
they are flush here
I could maybe I could even lay down on a
pillow or something of course I can
still feel them they don't hurt any
they're not they don't anymore but you
have you need to have really a perfect
seal even if you have them deep inside
sometimes you lose seal so you have to
get sure to really get blocked to get
isolated and then look at some slight
overpressure which after some time or
maybe if you pull your ear but then you
I do seal again so after some time this
overpressure gets away and then suddenly
the sound builds up and what you get I
heard it was talking about it it's a
neutral honest transparent very detailed
with lots of hair around instruments
nothing melts together yes the sound
stage is of course not somehow broad but
it's realistic
so when listening for my binaural
recordings with a thematic I feel as if
I was in inside the room which I don't
get usually with other headphones or in
use when I put up my Sennheiser HD
channel yeah it sounds nice but it's not
the effect as if I was sitting inside
this room while with the animatics
I watched my videos walking through the
new year's path and maybe the frequency
my equalizing which I applied to my
recordings is not perfect because I
equal eyes it's rather for the HTC Zanna
these are far far more details than the
HD 600 farmer resolving some more direct
sounding therefore it's not equal they
sound similar because both tend to Sun
neutral but these are women revealing so
my equalizing for my normal for all my
recordings is maybe not perfect for
faretta Matic but it's still ok so that
the tonality is great and what is nice
is this this ambience that you get when
I listen to my and all recordings I
really have the impression as if I was
there which I don't get with any other
headphone so they have a very precise a
very realistic
Imaging also soundstage which is not
exaggerated in any way not artificial
and the sound is simply pure neutral
honest not colored in any way of course
depending on tips how go to your cities
you will get added more based on more
treble so but the tonality is simply
perfect it now sounds off so the treble
especially treble sounds it might be
slightly to boost it or to - too little
depending on your run your seal on the
tips but it sounds correct
there is no peak nothing artificial it
just sounds if you listen to too high
heads to cymbals
it sounds very realistic which I don't
get with any other in here they may
sound may be more Airy more open but
they don't sound as realistic as the
automatic so now I would like to provide
you some sound samples and it was really
a hassle to record because yeah I showed
you it disappears inside my ear while
here the system maximum I can get inside
so the ear canal here is way shorter so
it doesn't react the impedance of this
whole system is completely different to
a human ear so I don't get yet what I
get from other in years which don't rely
that much on the deep insertion and so
on so if I put a normal in here I let it
rather not I don't put it that deep
inside I just let it did I get a seal
then it sounds more most realistic why
with the automatic it doesn't work like
this so it really has to get deep inside
but then it didn't sound correct to me
so I don't apply my usual equalizing
which I used for all the other in years
but I applied the diffuse field
compensation which comes with this
system here and on top of this I boost
travel even more this will result in
slightly hissy sound you will hear some
some high-pitched noise but otherwise I
don't get the sound close to what I'm
hearing so I had to boost on top of this
diffuse feel composition I had to boost
well even more everything else is
untouched so I left it like this
I hope the tonality it sounds different
for sure but it doesn't sound off in any
way so this diffuse with compensation
already does the job just that it still
likes travel compared to what I hear in
reality I recorded both with the big
tips so also the automatic gear 3xr and
let's play both naked without any
adapter simply from the iPhone which has
a quite a low output impedance I think
close to zero
I think below one ohms and we will hear
the difference I will start with the ER
4xr and then switch over to the ER 3xr
and at the end you will hear the
original track it's analog from sokka's
on press freedom simply yes I want to
first of all it represents all
frequencies nicely so you have bass you
have meat you have nice treble also
quite quite a lot of treble so you can
concentrate on the differences and it's
also based on a repeating pattern so we
can switch more often but first let's
listen to these to make it without any
adapter playing from an iPhone and then
we will start to add the adapter and so
on and so on so let's check it out
I think could hear the ER 4xr sounds
definitely more sparkling it might
appear even more resolving but in
reality it just a more elevated tribal
region and to prove you this let's have
a look at some measurements they were
measured out of the iPhone without any
adapter with pink noise therefore the
ple reject and in green you can see the
ER for XR in blue that er 3 XR and you
can see not only travel is different but
also based the ER 3 seems to have an
even more elevated base therefore the
er4 XR appears may be slightly more
transparent or whatever what happens if
I add the adapter here so this is a
measurement taken of the ER 3 XR with
adapter on and you can see it already
raises travel a little bit it's still
not on the ER 4 XR level base remains
the same so it's really only travel
starting it we have 1 kilo Hertz which
raises or drops depending on the output
impedance and measured from the PC you
can see that the ER 3 XR is clearer than
the ER 4x Allen played from an iPhone so
how does the ER 4 XR look when measured
from the PC you can see Trevor becomes
quite elevated already so both measured
from PC the ER 3 XR and ER for X arm the
difference is the tilt the ER for XR has
less bass no treble
while the 3 XR has slightly more bass
and still less treble about from that
the tonality is small as the same so
let's listen to them again and now I
would later eat our 3x our first naked
from the iPhone then played from the
adapter and at the end played from the
PC which raises 12 even more and from
the PC compared to the ER for XR and at
the end you will hear again the original
track so let's release it
so you could hear the output impedance
has a big influence on the sound of both
but if you want to bring the response of
the ER 3x a closer to the ER for exact
simply use some higher output impedance
or use some adapter like this this is 30
ohms it's not quite close to this and I
think with around hundred fifty ohms you
should be quite close but in my case it
reduced volume so much that it was
unusable from an iPhone you would
probably need a name yeah and please
don't tell me that they need an amp or
whatever the only change is really or
the only factor which influences the
sound is the output impedance there they
have twenty two ohms or forty five ohms
I mean they can be powered by some clock
or whatever so yeah I like the ER 4xr
more because I don't need any adapter it
sounds very clear very detailed the ER
3xr can be brought a similar level but
you have to wrestle with the adapter and
you still have more bass so it always
appeared a little bit too boo me to me
why the ER for exercise is spot-on with
the big tips when I have the perfect
seal it just amazing really I mean I
like the Odyssey I sent em a lot too
because it it gives a different
impression of sound but it's not
necessarily as pure as natural sounding
as the ER for XR so the odyssey is way
more coloured despite the cypher cable
and my additional equalizing so maybe
let's compare these two but yeah take
these samples with a bit of a
reservation
I had a listen again to my recordings of
the I sign that I did they are there the
tonality is captured quite well why
would the the a thematic it's not that
easy
because first of all I always need some
time until I get them inside so the time
between switching so that I can compare
my original sound and the recording is
simply longer it's not that easy the
brain already adjust to the sound
brain is really easy to fool therefore I
think people can listen to strange
sounding idiots because after some time
the brain becomes yeah used to the sound
therefore you have you need some quick
switching and it's not that easy to make
with the automatic it doesn't sound as
pure from the recording as in reality
but I think it's close so let's compare
the etymology of 4xr played from an
iPhone against the Odyssey I sign 10
played from an iPhone with this cypher
cable first generation because you could
hear the second generation sounds also
different and I would play my usual
playlist but only maybe 3 tracks I don't
want to play everything also in future I
may be I might adjust the playlist at
some other tracks some know some heavy
metal or some acoustic stuff because
people are still asking for acoustic
stuff but I think the best resolving
source or the best would be pink noise
with pink toys you would immediately
hear that changing sound so heavy metal
I think is definitely best for judging
the difference in sound not classical
music because you never know how or how
realistic the recording is by itself I
mean I know how a violin sounds but the
recording of the violin is again
different so who says that the recording
of the violin sounds like a real violin
then you again listen to it for a
headphone so it's way easier to judge
the the coloration of the headphone by
simply listening to a full range signal
like pink noise like heavy metal but not
a vocal or a very limited bandwidth
classical music which doesn't have any
bass doesn't have any upper treble
simply meets and many headphones sound
fine with meets but they sound off with
prevalent and and bass so you want it
maybe I will make a known video about
this because I'm interested by myself a
pure vocal we will compare two
headphones or two speakers and then a
full
arrangement around this walk out and
again compared comparing the same and
I'm sure you will hear way more
differences by comparing the whole
arrangement
instead of just listening to the voice
doesn't reveal anything but yeah back to
the samples automatic air for Exxon
against the OTC I sent an with cypher
cable this is really crucial part you
need the cypher cable or additional
equalizing because otherwise it will
still sound very strange you will hear
the switching is weird but when you get
used to the sound when you listen for
longer to the Odyssey it becomes normal
sounding so this is just the brain but I
think the automatic is actually closer
to the original source which it could be
maybe brought 200% I'm not sure how
valid this diffuse feed compensation
curve for calibration really is here I
just used it because it appeared quite
valid to me but maybe in reality I think
it's still different or closer to the
original source which was played so
let's have a listen again and at the end
I will talk a little bit more me
is it just to treat my name inside my
fantasies come to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you
am i touching you I wanna feel it
I definitely like both although for
judging the recording correctly or
hearing the real sounds I would
definitely take the automatic the I sign
10 is nice it's fun sounding and I
really enjoy it a lot I often when I go
out I use it because I'm not isolated in
any way so I got used to this he locks
in the meantime they are quite nice so I
like it and they don't block me out but
for a really critical listening if I
want the purest sound the a thematic I
mean I have to hear something really
better I'm not sure if there s our
aversion s a version I don't want to
spend another three hundred dollars I'm
satisfied with this and say something to
me
I like this may be slightly more base or
slightly elevated I'm not sure but I
think it sounds definitely more
realistic to me then if I had less space
here you can adjust it easily by the
equalizer I mean I could equalize those
as well but they sound fine to me like
this so make it without any adapter and
therefore for me it was definitely worth
spending
come on cables spending twice the price
over the you know what we have here so
over the ER 3xr although these are nice
too and with an adapter they are quite
close but still not hundred-percent
equal but you can also influence the
sound a lot with with with the tips so
maybe I will show you I measure the ER
3xr with the big tips and I also tried
it with the smaller tips and you can see
the difference is quite huge maybe also
because this is don't measure them
correctly in realities the differences
may be not that huge but there is
definitely some difference therefore if
someone claims that he gets a great
sound with these formulas know you get
something completely
and not what was intended by automatic
you have to get it very deep I would use
this because they are completely fresh a
friend already bought them I will send
them away today yes I told me to pass I
have this and I'm satisfied also not
that easy left right there is just a
small imprint here right or left but you
can at least you can feel it at night so
when I take my nail and scratch around I
know which one is left all right
so when I put it inside you really have
until it it stands I mean until it
doesn't go in any further then you have
the correct seal I couldn't do this with
the foam is it's impossible they would
get stuck inside but now when I get both
inside I can hardly hear my voice
anymore
so I completely block us still on the
left side
it's not easy they also suggest to two
more more show them a little bit now and
perfect I hear my voice the rest of my
voice is perfectly centered otherwise if
you lose seal slightly you will hear the
voice drifting to the right or left then
you know that the seal is not that great
and then the sound you have to get used
maybe half a minute until the pressure
gets out or whatever and I mean if
you're not used to a neutral sound but
to the strange coloration with bass
boosted mess then I can understand that
some reviewers don't like this but then
they should stop reviewing in years
because yeah I read some of you
complained it sounds doesn't sound good
but I will use it for measurements to
calibrate my I mean you cannot get a
better and more pure sound than this
because of the deep insertion you omit
all ear canal in ear canal resonances
they get squashed a squished squashed so
they shift in to the inaudible range
because usually you have resonance at
five at nine kilo Hertz also depending
on the shape
deep you have them inserted and they are
so deep so close to the eardrum that
there are no resonances anymore they are
tuned to have to omit this and to really
get this sound which you would usually
get directly at the eardrum this is what
a thematic is so famous for the other
ones you know they may be close but they
will never get this peak free sound
because everyone has different Peaks
slightly shifted towards 7 8 kilohertz
or whatever but with the automatic you
you emit this you avoid all these Peaks
and therefore the sound is so realistic
so pure so everyone complaining that
they don't sound good has simply no clue
or it doesn't have them inserted
correctly or with those foamies forget
them don't use them yeah I think this
was it about the automatic er Forex are
not cheap but for $300 I mean it's still
cheaper than the I sign this different
kind of India but what's the price for
the Sony and the rx 1600 1000 in who
would buy this if you can get this this
sound for $300 and I prefer this over
any over here of course the effect is
different I mean you you have them
inside your ear there is some pressure
you you feel them but they a more
revealing way more precise than any over
here I've heard I can really sink into
the music when I close my eyes I I I can
really it's different when the I sign I
don't get this they're more open somehow
I get a a broader soundstage whatever
but I don't get this this effect that I
get from the automatic which is really
sinking into the music being a part of
the music especially with great
recordings not necessarily
high-resolution but great recordings
just yeah if you if you want to
high-resolution take
the ones from chesty records he has some
really great also binaural or half
binaural with listened with the
automatic they sound so real as if you
were really inside this stage music or
whatever yeah I don't want to bore you
more just wanted to clear up some
confusion regarding er 3 XR vs. yeah 4
XR because many claim it is the same
some claim that air for excellence way
better the biggest difference is the
different impedance of both I also read
some comments complaining that the air
for exile is too soft
well I hardly get over half volume with
this from my iPhone and I mean this is
an iPhone but some amp thousand dollar
him so I'm not sure maybe you have some
volume limiter inside but I can hardly
get two thirds it's already way too not
for me if I would never with the ER for
exa the ER three XL is even I could
hardly go up to half therefore I even
preferred them with the adapter of all
the adapter is of course annoying
because it sticks out but without
adapter I could hear lots of his MP some
some side noise when I was listening to
music browsing or whatever I could hear
some some static noise or whatever the
adapter put it down so it was not
achievable anymore therefore I really
like the ER for XR and I highly
recommended to all those who who are
after a pure natural uncle at faithful
honest sound not too boastful like I
don't know I just got the BG v Bo what's
the name believe dmg and I wonder how
can this be hyped so much it's really
nothing special I mean I haven't heard
the BM b GV b DM 6 yet because I think
it's not available I was talking with
the distributor if I could get one yes
but we have no samples maybe in spring
so the dmg is nothing it sounds just
crappy and cost $150 I think Hanna 30 I
don't know but way too expensive for
what you get it's nice you can exchange
the cable it has
filters which I wouldn't sweat anyhow
therefore if you have money you get the
ER 3xr for less or for the same amount
with an adapter and it's already so
close and way better than anything else
yeah but I hope I didn't bore you too
much the measurements were of course
compensated for the fuse field and
compensated they look a bit different
you know this hump and then nothing
so quite a realistic sound and I have to
hear something really better on more
neutral than this this campfire
Andromeda or whatever they are not
neutral they have a flat respond but
uncompensated this is not what what
happens at your eardrum at your eardrum
you get a big hump at 3 kilohertz then
again some Peaks but not a flat response
so I'm not sure what people are
listening to yeah I could talk for hours
I have to go I have to pick up my son
from kindergarten I hope you enjoyed
this a little bit take my samples with a
little bit of a reservation don't take
them too seriously
someone was complaining yeah my my lcd
i4 sounds I was listening to your
recording for my LCD eye for of course I
mean the LCD iPhone is completely
colored if you listen to this again
through a color in it you get double the
coloration so of course the original
source will sound like yours
you have to listen in my case the
reference is always the HTC standard
with sana works profile and I try to
equalize my recordings to bring them as
close to what I'm hearing through the
Sennheiser then what I'm hearing in
reality and of course it's not capturing
them 100% so if you listen to my
recordings you won't have de the
impression is you listening to the a CDI
fault but the characteristics the
strange coloration of the LCD iPhone
which is really heavy heavy I mean very
strange Peaks this is captured well and
the same goes for the automatic although
not hundred percent I think you can
still hear that
has hardly any coloration that it's a
smooth response over a very sparkling
very resolving with no strange peaks and
I think this is what I tried and what I
managed to offer you here yeah again
 too long
quite long videos I wonder if anyone
watches this 2d but really but I mean if
you are talking about the best then you
need to talk a little bit more not
simply talk this is the best but also
proof and I stopped getting interested
in in in years 20 or 15 years ago
because all sounded like crap to me I
somehow missed this this progress which
was made during the last years with the
MH one I completely missed it then it
came again thanks to John yang who told
me about it who recommended me some
really decent sounding not perfect son
of a decent Sony and he also recorded me
to try a thematic again because the
first time I tried a net emoticon year I
had the EF 4s I think I put it in like
this hey what's this
come on I was not aware that you have to
start it deep inside until it hurts the
first time
I tried the nk5 it hurt it really hurt I
had to get used to it now my ears are a
bit stretched not virgin anymore so I
even used the bigger tips and the
smaller ones don't see that well anymore
but then yeah now I finally know what I
missed all these years I would have
maybe yeah fooled around with all those
crappy in years overpriced ones from for
from I'm not sure what sure I'm not sure
from Sony all those overhyped ones from
from fire or whatever I just looked at
measurements from them and I mean I
couldn't listen to this but this is
really really fine if you get used to
this this if they also find many more
expensive over years let alone in years
over years trelaina magnetic maybe not
not
electrostatic I've never had a Stax
headphone simply way too expensive for
me I wouldn't spend two three thousand
four thousand dollars for a headphone
and needing some additional power source
and two to power those electrostatic
drivers or panels but I think I mean we
are not that far off regarding dynamics
especially frequency response micro
tonality is really really really nice
and I highly recommend it for all those
who may have never tried it already did
er 3 XR 450 outperforms all the others
in this price range and this maybe not
worth double the price but it still I
mean especially because I don't need any
adapter and it sounds a little bit finer
from from from scratch yeah but now
again I have to go what time is it
proof 5 minutes left fans out for
watching and see you in our video maybe
with some speakers again because people
seem to get bored from India or from
headphones not sure I made so many
speaker videos hundreds nearly I don't
know 3 400 speaker videos I think we
should now look for the really best ones
and I think we have one of the very best
in years around on the market yeah I
have to call things off for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
