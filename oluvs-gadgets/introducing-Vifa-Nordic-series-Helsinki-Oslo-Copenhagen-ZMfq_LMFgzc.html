the FIFA Nordic Series FIFA's lineup of
wireless also portable speakers with the
biggest one the Stockholm being a
stationary unit which is not represented
here all these are portable units with
built-in battery and all are named after
Scandinavian capitals the smallest one
day Helsinki Oslo and Copenhagen if you
didn't know FIFA before well shame on
you is this is not some no-name company
they have been around in the hi-fi
business for more than 80 years so they
are older than JBL or bose and FIFA has
been known for building the world's best
speaker drivers until they came up with
their own portable bluetooth speaker
lineup I thought I would like to
introduce you to each of these speakers
later on we'll also get inside and have
a listen compare all of them I already
did lots of videos about fe5 sinky and
claimed it to be one of the best if not
the best compact portable speaker but
many complained it to have a bit of a
female design like a handbag the newest
model the horselaugh is slightly bigger
and heavier but again one of the best
i've heard in this class the copenhagen
the biggest one is of course also the
most powerful one but all of them have
in common that they really have a kind
of what I would call pure sound
well many companies have slogans like
here the proof but in reality the
speakers are sounded they don't sound
really quite true the FIFA speakers all
sound quite similar
of course the smallest Helsinki cannot
quite compete with the bigger ones but I
was impressed to tell the truth with the
Oslo because this sounds really mature I
even prefer it over the largest model
not only because it's smaller and
lighter but this is the oldest model it
came out two or three years ago
in the meantime FIFA obviously improved
quite a bit and maybe also they improved
the drivers the acoustic design this
release
for my taste better than the Copenhagen
all speakers come with an app they FIFA
app unfortunately on iOS devices is not
very stable so you have to restart the
app quite a bit often to really make the
speakers visible you can switch between
different sound modes usually they come
with a neutral stock tuning but for
example the Helsinki sounds a bit tinny
with the stock neutral tuning I would
recommend to change it to late night
because this really flattens the
frequency response completely the Oslo
sounds great with natural tuning but you
can push bass and treble a bit more with
late night and it really makes it a kind
of well portable boombox
but still much better than everything
else on the market also larger speakers
the Copenhagen has unlike these which
have only bluetooth has also Wi-Fi and
optical in so this is of course the most
advanced model but it's also exactly as
I already told you it's the oldest one
so the Bluetooth is not very stable
compared to these so I think it's best
to get inside and have a listen to all
three I will select one single song and
then switch between these speakers so
that you get an idea I'm always using
high quality binaural microphones you
already should listen with good
headphones to get a realistic impression
so let's get inside and let's have a
listen so please put up your headphones
now as you can see I'm wearing a head
cam and together with the binaural
microphones you should get more or less
the same impression I had when I
recorded this video I will play a house
track which is a cover of a classic
George Duke tune starting with a few
very silky first both because have
neutral settings
many of it you can hear that it sounds
it in bikini I will switch over to the
Oslo
it sounds fuller more full-bodied more
mature Helsinki again
and let's change with an ethnic ueno
here now the Helsinki sounds more
similar to the Oslo
now Islam
Helsinki
or slow again and let's change also here
to late night
now the Oslo sounds cooler than the
Helsinki
making the Helsinki song again a big
thing
post low again
Helsinki
now let's check the Copenhagen I will
start with the Oslo now both are again
playing with new fresh settings
Copenhagen maybe you can hear that the
Copenhagen has a broader sound stage but
the Twitter's seem to emit up words it
sounds clearest from above so
it's listed exactly on axis you lose
quite a bit of throttle definition also
and I will switch to late night here
which makes it sound really well our
full bodies and big
a Copenhagen I really have to listen
from above
but you can hear that the smaller health
Isola Oslo can keep up pretty well with
their big Copenhagen
maybe I should sit more censored here
Copenhagen again
yeah I should listen from here
now let's put them far away and check
how loud they can play both are playing
with neutral settings at maximum and I'm
starting again with the Helsinki
Oh slaw both are pretty loud
although the Oslo force at the edge but
there are some hints of first before
the Helsinki sounds cleaner here mostly
again
now let's try the Copenhagen again both
maximum volume and neutral settings with
the Oslo playing first
you
what slogan
you
again
ha
I hope this short subject was helpful
for you to give you a first impression
of the qualities of these speakers of
course I should have played more
different tunes with different genres
but the video would have become even
longer all have this typical FIFA HiFi
sound of course they're smaller Helsinki
cannot quite compete with the bigger
ones but I'm mostly impressed with the
new FIFA Oslo it's still pretty portable
it has less than two and a half
kilograms so it's quite comparable to
the JBL extreme also size-wise not that
much much difference but it wipes the
flow with it sound wise it's also louder
although you've heard there was some
slight distortion at maximum volume I
think this is it's maybe the sample I
got here that because I hear some slight
farting from that Beck driver from the
back woofer it has two woofers one at
the front one at the back two main
drivers and I think for Pacific radiator
so if there is really lots of tech
inside yeah
the Copenhagen has of course more
spacious sound it's has a better sound
stage but it's nearly twice as heavy
it's also bigger and the battery is not
that great on this model at moderate
volume levels I got around four and a
half hours while with the same loudness
level I got more than ten from the Oslo
and around eight hours from the Helsinki
so I think the Oslo especially now for
our European viewers Amazon German
Amazon store has that blue one so
exactly this model for 329 euros maybe
an error I don't know but for 329 this
is a steel it becomes directly
comparable to the Harman Kardon going
play I have here which costs $2.99 so
the fee for floor
sounds a bit better I would say maybe
not at maximum volume here still the
Harman Kardon has the edge but if you
really like this high five sound well
the FIFA Oslo is really one of the best
because I've heard of course we will do
more comparisons maybe even against the
JBL extreme but this cannot quite
compete this is another class this is
more a boombox
why this really gives you this true
high-five fuel sound yeah I will of
course also prepare a more detailed
review on my site with frequency
response measurements and so on please
give me some time I would like to cover
all three at once and I will post a link
in the description when it's ready yeah
thanks a lot for watching for 3:29 this
is I don't know you won't find a better
speaker than this maybe not
not the color I don't like blue that
much but I think it still it still
sounds decent a bit like a jeans like my
trousers here the other colors go for
399 currently usually the original price
is 499 euros so 393 29 is really quite
affordable yeah thanks a lot
to anyone who watches this I hope you
liked it and we will see us in the next
video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
