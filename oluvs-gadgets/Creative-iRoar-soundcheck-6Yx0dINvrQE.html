like to check out the creative high roar
to tell the truth I'm not quite sure
what to think about this because it
carries already a bit higher price tag
so more comparable to premium models
like the Dalek edge of if I think around
$400 although in the meantime you can
find it for cheaper I saw it on Amazon
for 360 but it's still pretty expensive
it's packed full with features like
micro SD playback it has even optical in
can act as digital audio converter
through USB on your PC there are even
some add-on apps which you can install
and do crazy stuff I think it has a
motion sensor or some microphone so when
motion or some noise is detected it will
play music or an alarm but yeah I would
really rather like to concentrate more
on sound as always I'm using binaural
microphones so you should listen to
headphones as we will play some tunes
and check out how it sounds I saw some
videos on YouTube comparing it against
the cable extreme and it seems as if the
IRA was better
I think this comparison comparisons a
little bit of as the sound is not
disappointing but it's not really as
great as I hoped it to be somewhat even
claim this is the best speaker he's
heard better than the few fighters in
key yeah but first maybe let's compare
it against the Reeve is yeah it's still
alive and currently it's discounted on
the Riverside so you can get it for $150
so quite a bit cheaper than the higher
roar I will start with a track from from
Princess freesia from her latest album
Stella sonic and I will start with the
IRA first so please have a listen
the volume is scented with iPhone and
speaker buzzes there are always some
Odin jumps
the river
it sounds bit clearer what is lacking
any punch somehow the rebus is not more
boosted the bass is just fuller deeper
but there is an app available which can
give you some sound adjustments now we
are completely flat but I prepared an
equalizer which the boost read a little
bit and base we have some the lowest
band is I think it's 31 hurts but and I
think it sounds better now we also have
the option for roll and now the sound
becomes a little bit of depth and and
also for the let's say I will switch
over to the device again notice becomes
a little tool
but it still likes any punch and
fullness so what's the problem here
therefore I thought we will check out
some frequency response measurements and
as you can see the neutral setting is
really flat but the bass are also
already above hundred Hertz and there is
the real role of is around 75 Hertz so
there is no real deep bass the Reavers
place down to around 60 maybe and the
other problem is treble it just yeah it
all also rolls off around 10 kilohertz
so with some EQ adjustment just like I
showed you through the app you can get a
frequency response like that which is
even flatter so I boosted bass lightly i
boost the treble together with roar you
get a nice full bodied song but still no
real deep bass and when looking at some
lower volume levels you can see that the
sound is not adjusted dynamically so at
low levels it still will tend to sound a
little bit tinny there is no loudness
compensation nothing it can play pretty
loud but as you can see at maximum there
is lots of bass reduction so the sound
is just tinny although loud
therefore yeah not quite sure which
speaker to compare it to therefore I
thought we will check the dolly cage
with which is a great low level
performer the fee for syncing on the
other hand performs really great at high
levels the IRA does nothing of that
great so it's neither a low level nor a
high level performer and I would like to
demonstrate you this with another trick
let's see what I have here also from
Princess freesia again starting with the
high road first
another trick of course we are rather
yeah we know half the volume curve is
all this pretty strange on this it
becomes loud very quickly fun toys this
is the first volume step by the way so
it doesn't play any lower any softer is
a little bit too loud they have let's
see the next volume jam
it's not very sensitive this wallet
control and we switch over to the dunny
cash
I think it sounds yeah much fuller much
more spacious also because of back and
front driver's and you can also hear
some first hints of distortion when I
increase volume slightly I will kiss
bottom under catch as well this goes
away and we are not very mouthy
the Dalek hedge does not distort at all
so I will lower volume again so similar
simulate a rather ambient or background
listening situation it's nice open
sounding now thanks to the adjustments
with it but this distortion will just
fall away which shows me that Iowa is
inactive but it's
now we can increase volume and it won't
be stopped so with all the adjustments
the sound simply tends to it sounds
better but also more distorted yeah
let's check it against the default
thinking maybe which is I think a great
double not low but high level performer
at low levels both are comparable
although the favela stinky has a much
wider frequency response deeper bass
also still a bit nicer treble so the
Train electric also princess freesia
together is all persona the base runway
is horrible
again you just missing I think this is
pretty obvious the difference and I will
put them far away so we can really crank
them close to maximum or a bit higher it
will also increase phase response like
that with placement closer to the wall
so increasing volume again on the
t-virus in case i will take more center
but you can hear that is already
straddles with the stretch maybe
something else a severe there this one
is just a distorted mess of oh yeah
according to the volume we are still
below half a FIFA
the PA is playing in late night mode now
so I will switch to the neutral setting
this will prevent any distortion of
higher levels and we can of course
started to make some without any
problems but still even with neutral it
sounds fuller this one is a bit louder
not to match them everybody from that
way here I will increase volume to make
some no but almost
let's know even by the way let's see
which one can play louder and also
sounds better
this is the higher now you can see that
volume doesn't change a lot in email
here
so the instead of doing a final stepping
for low levels then they wasted the
whole volume range in the upper part the
people sing
then I think this is what you appear
what I am talking about is it's becoming
ridiculous sounding only thing we could
try this medium if you can slightly
level but the sum of their absence is
much cooler
unison from Nigel
I know that the extreme sounds much
better at maximum than the highroad
therefore I'm not quite sure what the
others were comparing you can hear the
difference to the Helsing is already
pretty obvious so to the extreme it's
even more obvious as the extreme is just
more boosted maybe let's see if I have
another track the here is one also from
Niger good
I will crank it again to maximum you can
hear that last four five steps do
nothing in the water you can hear that
the sound doesn't really change so there
is hardly any
the base with the steel wires then war
really becomes a baby and apply levels
now it's a bit cooler and as soon as we
rented pasta it becomes a so yeah I mean
this is what I wanted to show you it's
neither great for low level listening
nor for high levels although it can play
pretty loud I mean the hell sink is
still much louder and place much fuller
for if I could get both for the same
price yeah not sure if you need all
these apps and add-ons let's have a look
what kind of add-ons there are yep let's
see you have to install them through
through alarm clock bedtime
things you to sleep dice can dice throw
a dice metronome jukebox monster really
Fame I mean I don't know if you really
need this this is a speaker so it should
sound good and although it doesn't sound
bad
it's just nothing exceptional then if I
think he wipes the floor with it
regardless if low levels at low levels
both are comparable but that we catch
for example is which has this nice warm
sound at low levels yeah makes the
I really sound a bit funny not
ridiculous but because it's not bad but
for example it doesn't have any loudness
adjustments or tera base is missing here
tera bass boosted based on the on all
the other role models it's not available
here which is a pity because for low
levels it could definitely get along
with slightly more bass books but still
the bass just reaches down to around 70
Hertz while this one plays down to below
50 this 55 so this is quite a difference
therefore I'm not really sure this
highest price tech is really justified
and then I always definitely not the
best speaker in this price range lots of
others better ones I even think they're
small
I will go some title bit better though
but it's smaller half the price Sentier
sounds a little bit it has this terrible
included within roar setting maybe they
will issue an update firmware update
yeah the same driver layout as we had on
the very first roll so two main drivers
one referred to passive Raiders to the
site yeah I mean it's a nice picture but
definitely overpriced my knees are
pretty
clicking so thanks for the second things
all for watching I hope this was helpful
to give an idea about the IRA of course
it's already included within the
database with both neutral setting and
with my my custom equalizer that I that
I did we have to scroll through this
here just boost base here the lowest
Bend and treble slightly and then you
will get a sound quite comparable to the
fifth I think he regarding frequency
response to us that it's not as wide it
misses a bit the low frequency spectrum
and also the high frequency spectrum and
we will also have a kind of immersion
setting I didn't show you this is pretty
nice maybe which track yeah let's take
it out the the one from Nigel good again
from before because it has not some nice
stereo separation and I will show you
the immersion effect sorry
so f is a little bit so we are broad now
if I reduce this it compresses the
sausage slightly has we also have a
drumroll
not if it's really here about here yes
it is so I'll cross road or ultra white
is definitely much broader but not as
wide as the ultra wide setting from the
higher goal which is really incredible
but here at least you can control it
separately while with the I roll goal we
will see this later on in another video
it's all packed into one setting so you
cannot adjust the sound anymore if you
select ultra wide you cannot adjust base
or a drawer at Terra base and so on yeah
I hope this was helpful I hope you liked
it and we will see us in the next video
also coming up the Aurora CO the smaller
model which i think is a little bit of a
better deal
until then state you don't have a nice
time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
