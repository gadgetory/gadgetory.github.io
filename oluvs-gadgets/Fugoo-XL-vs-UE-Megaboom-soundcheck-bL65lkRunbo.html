XL versus day you in makeup on both
competing exactly the same class of
potables because costing the same being
both rugged auto models completely
waterproof and offering 360-degree sound
the food will excel may appear a bit
larger but when taking it out of this
jacket it's not that large anymore
you also have to think that these are
just two bumper so without them it would
be even smaller but fooled does some
serious drop testing and this thing can
definitely take some pounding before
owning the food excel I read some
reviews claiming that the mega boom has
much more base so I became unsure
because I thought maybe it's not that
great but before having a listen there
is also some confusion about placement
of the mega boom it's a 360 degrees
because so it shouldn't matter but in
reality it's quite tricky I would like
to demonstrate you this with a track
from Pink Floyd we are listening to the
food excel so this is there is some
stare effect you can definitely hear
left right here while with the mega boom
yes we rather get a front and back
effect
fool again so the correct placement for
the mega bomb would be exactly like that
now we have a left and right to prove
this I will start a noise generator and
we should listen we should hear both
channels now this is some pink noise now
we are hearing only the left channel
both again only the right channel
otherwise we would hear again a front
and the back which is yeah off I mean I
know that the mega bomb becomes a bit
muffled like that but well this is the
design so they should have designed it
may be a bit better but yeah let's
listen to some track some check also if
the mega bomb has really more bass or
than the 4 XL I will play a track from
NCS which contains some nice deep bass
notes and let's have a listen to their
folk excel first
you can hear all four notes here the
mega boom well nothing not even the last
note
although wait a minute let's start from
the beginning here the last note is is
they're quite barely the 2x elegant
maybe I should increase volumes laughing
that you can already hear the difference
here pretty well let's listen to now
track some smooth jazz great thing of
the previous of course that it has some
real stereo separation
the mega boom I mean the sounds yet and
almost right missing any words for this
and saying that the mega bomb has more
basis false or or a lie this isn't
another trick
yes sounds like another strong not very
comparable to store
no trick
yeah I couldn't quite listen to this
kind of song let's listen to something
else yeah she's hot like the weather
outside is also happy such as mountains
not very hard
let's check how well the 360-degree
sound works football
yeah but the smokiness is really
moderator here can use some real base
this isn't another crack some house
instrumental house is based on a track
from George tube which unfortunately is
not among us anymore
great musician I'm a big fan of George
juice while I was a mega boom yeah
doesn't do the strike injustice this is
just some pok pok pok I mean I will
increase volume slightly
megalo miss well
well the face from you yeah I think you
can give a difference it sounds much
more serious
yeah you heard the fugu needs some time
to get the final loudness of the
switching let's try another trick and I
will increase fall for maximum
yes the mega boom is slightly louder
here but the flu Excel has also an auto
mode although it has some distortion but
let's try any of now doorbell again both
at maximum just a mega below for excel
so now the difference is not as big and
more at the pro excel still sounds much
better on some aromas or droning droning
another crack
yeah now the megaphone is not that loud
anymore who always need some second to
reach the final love
March Fuller sounding let's try this
sounds ridiculous that's why this
make up
loudness wise not really much difference
but
the quicksand sounds much fuller
Oh
yeah uh no their poodles Winship easily
something like that
loccent free to make fun listen with
their makeup on no boom it all
yeah this doesn't really make much sense
I think the difference is pretty obvious
so I would really be ashamed to call it
speaker mega boom if it sounds like that
hey there is no boom I mean it there is
boom but not real bones just some
droning mass boom while this has really
some nice deep bass this is really a
strength of daifuku XL is it has some
pretty nice punchy deep bass oh it's
even similar to the Harman Kardon go and
play
although cannot quite compete because
it's much smaller of course but at
normal levels it's quite comparable fool
unfortunately didn't tune it perfectly
well there is some slight honking etsu
it meets a hunkiness with meat and the
cover also takes away quite a bit of
treble there should be more treble boost
to you so that it can come through you
can see this is there is too much too
much going on here also maybe some
reflection intro reflection between
surface and and Twitter so we can try
the noise generator again so we can hear
which one is playing now therefore Excel
how the sound changes when I put it
inside there is definitely a big
difference
so I prefer it naked without jacket what
we could also try this maybe get out and
see if they can swim let's see which can
swim better I will increase volume to
maximum maybe we can also hear something
make them sound definitely better inside
the water the food misses some clarity
inside water but I can hear more bass
from the football so yeah thanks a lot
for watching of course this was just a
joke both can swim as we've seen if you
have to pay the same price for both I
will definitely go for the full exam
much better speaker the the mega bonuses
not really worth the price thanks a lot
for watching I hope this was helpful and
see us in the next video bye bye
huh obviously it takes some water hmm
maybe it's really hollow just like a
sound this does nothing yeah seems to be
Hollow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
