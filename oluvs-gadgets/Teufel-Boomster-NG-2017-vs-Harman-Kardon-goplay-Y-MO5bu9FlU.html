welcome to Halloween no just kidding
they wanted to compare the toy food
boomstick new generation or ng against a
Hammond car don't go and play why this
well so far the Hammond Calgon play was
one of the best sounding portable
speakers in the size and class yeah we
still have the favelas law but it's way
more expensive so the TOEFL is more
comparable currently as pre-order you
can get it for 300 euros normal price is
350 the Hammond currently it costs about
the same although as refurbished you can
already find it around 200 the biggest
problem is that it's not really that
loud and the battery life is rather
crappy so at maximum you will get maybe
two hours towards 20 why are they
powerful boom so then you wanna use
quite a bit louder it's nearly as loud
as the JBL boombox as we've heard and
the battery life is also far better so
it makes him I got around five hours 28
more than twice the battery life of the
Hong Kong gunplay and sunrise both play
on a really high level the total boom
store may be a little bit more balanced
while the Harman Kardon has this typical
JBL Hammond cotton based punch a little
bit artificial may be a good thing with
the thoughtful is that you can adjust
the bass to your liking so you can boost
it up to 6 DB or reduce it by 6 DB it is
also a great FM radio also da beer radio
digital radio included and if you get
out of juice simply open this this
battery compartment and you can put in
normal double-a batteries so I think
it's a real nice boombox also weight is
comparable and it would be interesting
to hear how they compare I already
included the neutral booster the Harman
Kardon gunplay is also included with AC
powered or from battery but before you
listen let's check out some frequency
response measurements you can see the
boom stove with the bass adjusted to +4
ravine and the Harman Kardon gameplay
you see that they measure quite
similarly overall the base of the go and
play which is ittle bit deeper on the
other hand the base of the boom series
fuller overall also travel is more
balanced on the type of monster why they
go in play has a strange deep at around
3 kilohertz maybe because of the
crossover between woofer and tweeter
it makes them you can see the title
booms that can play
a bit louder although it's also visible
that base remains on a similar level as
the Harman Kardon can play at maximum
but now let's have a listen to both
first indoors later on we'll also get
outdoors but first let me take this off
I'm already sweating for spider-man as
always are we using my banner or
microphones as a head cam for this
immersive 3d sound experience you should
of course listen with headphones put
them up and let check them out I will
set pace 2 + 4 DB for the booster so
they will become more compelling the
volume is around half for both and the
bombs that we'll be playing first
one play
sounds maybe a bit more neutral non
attract
the road is a bit to season here but a
big advantage is that we test some nice
air accelerations of a broader sound the
world
takes a while to swim you can also hear
the sound one play has deeper bass but
the traces mess full
he'll attract some acoustic jazz meeting
always takes a while
the problem is travel which is not
rendered really well so that powerful
measures slightly better
something else really nice trick maybe
every day when I override
Soho Cosima visit more natural with a
battery something else we know this from
indian eyes of allah premix also this
year - the hi-hat moped patented -
sizzling I mean the a McCollum is really
playing on a high level positive ones
like bass reduce it to neutral
yeah
we're not that much difference in basis
here ago from both of all the cons I
definitely which is slightly depressed
the biggest problem with that bass
reflex system is that it can fart like
with this track definitely here's some
partners here Cowen's play doesn't have
this problem
so the some particular facts there might
be some pot whistling what noise and
reduce based on offer
it's better like this but then the paces
follow this fool is from the country
anymore
but now as the weather is so nice let's
get out and listen to them at higher
levels outdoors as you can hear it's
quite noisy here but I wanted to submit
a more kind of urban feeling maybe
instead of a silent Forest so you can
hear if these because are able to fight
all the noise volume is currently set to
around 3/4 the toy fire bomb store has
best set to maximum and I started a trek
from Quebec and the country bombs are
being her solitary
these seems to have somehow more
Panchala cosplay
we can give it they focus on small
balance
quite a bit of incredible skier
let's find our trek and I would increase
water for maximum doesn't play gets all
the way here with all the noise and
still do some base folder while
performing a lot of space with music is
probably the better choice I will step
baking powder some nice equal here
if they who have definitely made it
louder
standing away maybe you can meet us no
complain you can hear it's hardly here a
bow before the traffic noise above us
- is louder also at the cost of some
base but still manages to draw memories
here why the gunplay it's relative
it's some nice space
okay
come closer again as the quench main
city miserable
I think with here they both play on a
really high level although the Hammond
commander in place still has some
advantage in base so that base which is
deep is somehow more punchy also that's
not this thought or fart like from the
toy foot booster but this also depends a
lot on the music so with normal music I
would rather prefer that - booster why
with EDM dance tracks really this heavy
bass boosted music I would rather go for
the gunplay but at some point it will
probably become too soft so the powerful
booms - is definitely louder also way
more functions and better battery life
so it really depends on your taste I
cannot say this one is better than this
with some tracks I reap refer that to
eyford bumster even over the Oslo while
the Harman Kardon go play has this
really great Harman Kardon bass but it
doesn't sound that right with treble so
maybe because of the note also because
travel is slightly boosted and they
could have really put a bigger battery
inside this as it is now it's rather
ridiculous so I hope this was helpful
yeah get the toy album stores pre-order
as it's simply cheaper it will be 350
euros later on now 300 I think it's
really worth it yeah and a great a great
speaker for also for home use thanks all
for watching and see you in the next
video hit the Halloween bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
