hope to keep it as short as possible but
after my unboxing of the new music
screen I was quite shocked how loud they
are maybe the loudest speaker in the
size I've ever heard so I thought will
come out crank them to make some and
compare them how loud they really are I
brought the JBL charge for also the toy
heard boom stir together the mini accept
so let's have a listen as always I'll be
using my head cam for this first-person
view also my binaural microphones for
this 3d virtual surround sound please
pull up your headphones and let's check
them out
I will start with a cinnamon Erik
against the JBL chat for later on we'll
also compare the entire 2.1 set up
against the toffee boom star which as
you can see is way larger and heavier
also about as loud as the JBL boom box
so will hopefully if they can compete
loudness wise but now let's listen to
this volume is slightly above half and
the music is playing first
I respect Allah and to increase volume
what you can see this oh this is maximum
for the completely knows I can hear it
not a song to do yes more lower base but
sounds completely lost here and here I
can come closer to meters and can hardly
hear it near it you reduce volume for
simulators to do this storage for some
ether modulation somehow music and again
increasing going to make it rise to keep
the slower base which you can hardly get
any how I saw it is like a distorted
which reduce volume again some notches
to make it more compact Rogerio
is unreasonable doesn't have this lower
base but it's also way smaller so if we
attach their lyrics are it will
completely blow away they charge for so
that's this no warm song to thread jvo
is maximum if you leave it wind is sorry
you can see very winter atmosphere to
Dinh Diem so this is the church for
again switching over to their music and
messing
favela community stuff
yeah
judge for so I would need as an extreme
tool now for comparison because the JBL
has no chance against the nearest shop
now the thing again
so let's compare the 2.1 set up against
the target boom strap
now both music sisters whether this up
again volumes that about half
- a super bass mini reeks again it takes
some time until the sub connects again
so let's increase volume to maximum
they're really loud
only thing we could do is place this up
on the floor we have free to place it
anywhere on the floor shooting hands
base slightly so I let's put it here and
let's compare them again using volume to
mixer I think this app needs some time
to come back after switching let's write
this trick really crazy loud noise and
baking powder
it's quite a software suite has a base
but the public elites about three
seconds to come back again
definitely not amended health effects we
should start asana this strange media
disappear the top of the switching
always needs two seconds keep this in
mind
you know let's say we probably be louder
than that hard-pressed which is quite
impressive you to look at this size here
so starts becoming a little polish
compared to this one per minute leaks
are a friend here
it has Super Bass has included at the
size it's not surprising this is the
size event jaded extreme flu maybe we
are around two kilograms maybe slightly
above the TOEFL is nearly four again
this is one information and switching
three four seconds to get
crazy man
so really crazy performance here just
that this app needs some seconds to come
back after switching which you usually
won't do and you listen to music with
them I think out here they are really
loud a simile is twice the loudness of
the GB and transform you get this sound
it's really broken somehow it needs some
update I think it's even louder than the
U in mega boom of course we love this
bass so it makes me we could hear there
was hardly any bass but then at the
subwoofer it's still quite compact and
it completely blew away the JBL charge
for the 2.1 set up was louder than the
total booster which was really
surprising given the size but they don't
have this base so the powerful still had
deeper bass but I'm quite impressed you
can add a second sub a third fourth mini
Ric now they support this a connect plus
feature so you can connect as many as
you would like which is quite impressive
although they will only play in party
mode so no stare then this was playing
stereo quite nice you can separate them
several meters apart so I'm really
impressed the mini rigs free definitely
a step up over the old one and a step up
over most other speakers the j-th at
first sounded really ridiculous so for
making some party to mini Rick 3 with an
SAP flowing away anything else in this
size including the JBL extreme - yeah
the first anyhow so really really nice I
hope you liked this video I have to go
back I'm already a litte bit frozen but
I hope I could demonstrate you how loud
they are I wanted to bring I forgot to
bring my SPL meter we could maybe
measure them maybe I will do this
indoors I'm sure they will reach over a
hundred a table throughout the sub and
yeah keep in mind this is a modular
system so you can add a second sub a
third sub and and whatever you like yeah
I hope you like this a little bit winter
is back let's see how long it will last
this time thanks for watching and bye
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
