ivenna is a special edition you can get
this headphone for free if your honor
that creative SXF I may be sexify I'm
not quite sure but this is a portable
headphone and by creative which offers
with some kind of holographic sound some
binary simulation cost $250 quite
promising I would like to make a
separate video on it later on I still
have to experiment little bit with it
but if you order it you can get this
headphone for free actually I didn't
have that high expectations for it
it looks quite cheap I didn't know it
before but when I put it on and played
some first tracks I was really blown
away especially because it was free I
think it sounds really decent I made
some research and the creative or ivenna
life with excellent exclamation mark so
they call it a think qele qele
exclamation mark is quite popular it was
popular some years ago pill or is it
tile from inner fidelity already praised
it or some metal 5-7 one liked it it has
some pure cellulose drivers I didn't
know it so I ordered the life with
exclamation mark which costs currently I
think around forty five fifty dollars
quite cheap comes in a more precious
packaging as you can see so this is the
original creative life and this
packaging is from the or Ravenna SC and
the funny thing is my hope was that this
would sound even better but there is
immersion sounds better than the life
and I would like to demonstrate you this
it's by no means perfect it'll be too
much bass some slight treble emphasis
but that Union is really tasteful and
from what I've read from tail or tile
it's based on some foster design some
Japanese company also fostex belongs to
them I think they don't have a model
like this similar but the organ a life
and Nala se I think is the best sounding
one still it feels a little bit cheap
but it's quite comfortable comfortable
you just have to be sure to have the
cups really nicely on your ears so you
can see they are quite small the ears
should be rather maybe inside and if you
slide it around slightly you will get a
position where it sounds really perfect
the treble because travel is is the most
cruel
but with these headphones so let's have
a listen as usual let's compare the or
ivenna
is e against the Oregon alive first you
will hear the original trade which is
analog from circa some princess creature
and later on I will show you some
measurements so let's have a listen
I think you'd hear the Ravana is Isan
slightly smoother the difference to
their life exclamation mark is not that
big or let's call it Kel is not that
huge but it has a more elevated bass
more booming bass therefore the sound is
slightly out of balance Trevor doesn't
come through that much and also meets
appear slightly more color than this
let's look at some measurements here
there or ivenna is equal left and right
channel matching is maybe not that great
but it could be also a measuring error
of my system here I notice that there is
some slight left-right imbalance so I
will H left and right here for the AC
version and here for the life you can
see the live version has more bass also
a slight more hump here in the mids 3
kilohertz
appart from that they are similar but
the difference in bass definitely makes
that live version appear more imbalanced
the SE sounds also small farm
I tried equalizing the bass down but
still the SE version sounded somehow
more refined I'm not quite sure why I
was really impressed and I tried
equalizing it you can if you use this
amp you can also use it without this
holographic function
it comes with an internal EQ so you can
set the EQ like this and it makes the
frequency response close to flat I will
show you also average for left and right
this is for the havana is e and maybe
let's compare it against the sennheiser
HD 58 x jubilee from s drop which of
course is unequal
it would look like this if you have a
pen band equalizer with those standard
bands 31 Hertz 6200 25 Hertz 250 500
thousand 2000 so if you have such a 10
band equalizer I will post my settings
in the video description like this you
can make the frequency response really
close to flat and yeah let's compare
these two you can also compare it for my
database I recorded the SE and the life
of course without equalizing so you can
compare it against any other headphone
that I have recorded check my database
but now let's compare there as the
equalized se with a standard accuse or
nothing fancy I didn't try to remove all
these Peaks simply bring the balance a
little bit closer to flat and I really
think that there is a version which is
surprising sounds better and the more
expensive life exclamation mark or quell
or whatever so let's compare this tone
and at the end I will give you my resume
is it just a cheap my name inside my
fantasies come to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you
we can't be underwater
am i touching you I wanna feel
I'm not quite sure if the differences
are really that obvious from the
recording but when I compared both back
and forth I really liked their or ivenna
as somehow more than the HD 50x jubilee
of course I could equalize it as well
but this is 150 hundred $60 in the mean
time headphone like this yeah I cut it
for free with this ampere the amp works
really nicely also this holographic
feature and yes stay tuned until I
manage to prepare a full review I also
would like to offer you some sound
samples for those who don't know it you
have to take a photo of both of your
ears also your head it makes some
mapping some H RTF simulation maybe I'm
not cultural the technique behind it and
then if you turn on this feature you get
the impression as if the sound gets out
of your head to the front so if you're
listening to to a pair of speakers it's
not perfect so you still need to
equalize it but thank goodness there is
an equaliser included and then you can
make it sound really quite interesting
but back to the or event is I'm
impressed and really blown away already
whether they could an equaliser it blows
away any other headphone up to $50.00 I
mean it's not available separately I
would like to talk to creative that they
offer it may be for slightly cheaper
than the normal version because I think
it's really worth it I've not heard
another headphone for 45 I think they
they are close but it's still this
slight nuance that gives you this
improvement is definitely worth it
therefore it feels cheap also although
it's a closed headphone it doesn't it
doesn't block out anything
I think below one kilohertz you can hear
everything so it rather works like an
open headphone feels a little bit cheap
but it's not uncomfortable and I think
it's really great therefore I wanted to
share this with you
with some slight standard EQ you can
bring it to a really high level or so
imaging is really nice you could see
there is some slight left/right
imbalance but it could be also the
system
and when I listen back and forth
compared them I like that is even more
than the then the HD it still somehow
more maybe refined but regarding
response it's really really nice and
kudos to creative for offering such a
great headphone for free and check it
out from my database you can hear bass
is slightly too much also there is this
graininess I will overlay again the
equalized frequency response you can see
there is simply too much bass here at 40
50 Hertz it's nice but not that great
and treble here at 10 11 hey killer is
too thick so where some you can really
bring it to some to some very high level
yeah the live version I am a bit
disappointed because I thought it would
be even better but it's rather worse
which is really interesting so I hope
this was helpful for you also stay tuned
for my sexify review yeah it will take a
while I'm also in contact with the with
the developers I think there are some
issues it doesn't work with iOS devices
you can buy an adapter so it would work
but you cannot change any settings that
there obviously they told me that Apple
doesn't allow data to be put through the
Lightning port so you can listen to
music you can use it how you would
usually do but the setup that you have
to do from an Android phone also
equalizer it doesn't save the equalizer
settings within this you have to do it
either to the PC or an Android phone
then you have all settings here and you
can use it also with an iPhone so stay
tuned I hope you liked it and see you in
the next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
