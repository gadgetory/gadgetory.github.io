at another quite popular quite a head in
from China there accion actually I
rather wanted to concentrate on the
really decent ones show you those that
stand out and avoid all this crap that I
got so many based on your recommendation
just like this yeah I had a listen I put
it away immediately I forgot about it
but I get comments repeatedly claiming
that the acción is the best much better
than the Sony MH 750 which is quite okay
or even this JBL t110 this is flowers
although audio budget gave it quite a
high rating and people seem to like it
it's sound just horrible so there is so
much misbelief misinformation on the net
that I want to review that it's a crappy
sounding one the fact that it has loads
of pace doesn't make it sound good
because the interest is just off and to
not compare it to the Sony image one all
the time which is a completely different
sounding one here I have the mint or MDM
tx5 also quite bass-heavy but at least
it sounds acceptable so we will compare
these two but first let's look inside
the box
right the strengths and look has these
wings here looks a little like some old
caddy egg maybe and all this housings at
the back table is quite okay so Howard
buy some fabric also tips are nice quite
comfortable so if you put it inside it
stays quite well the problem is with
both of them when I put them in you get
this pressure and you hear how the sound
disappears so after some time after some
seconds it comes back obviously they are
not vented or something so you cause
some pressure on the drivers and here
even it it comes back with some plop
really yeah but these are real cheap so
I think the acción cost around ten
fifteen dollars please a bit more
expensive on Aliexpress I saw it for
maybe seventeen eighteen dollars let so
look at them mint mint what a name
quite a nice presentation with this box
looks like this there are awesome
magnetic salt they stick to each other
quite nice here is some bail so you can
wire it together originally they come
with these double flange tips
unfortunately they don't fit me that
well
quite small there is also a bigger set
included but I I cannot get a good fit
with them here I have I think these are
from the I have a prodigy one and they
don't change this on that much so I
think they are quite ok so when I put it
inside I here immediately this crackling
the sound disappears so after some
seconds it will come back again and yeah
before looking at some measurements
let's simply have a listen to them I
will put them inside here into this mini
DSPs measurement system I think it's not
even written which one is left or right
but you can see it's angled to the front
so this one is the left this one is the
right and then we can have a listen
first the rock xerocon then the mint and
at the very end the original track so
you have a ref reference how they should
sound in reality
you are in my thoughts I never stray
from the heart of you
I think I could hear compared to the
mint x5 which was somehow acceptable
maybe not the best sounding the Roxie
Kahn was just a mess horribly overblown
based some strange up amid speak which
gave it a whistling character so people
enjoying some with this must be somehow
deaf or maybe they have never heard
something normal sounding so let's have
a look at some measurements and this
time I want to show them uncompensated
to make them more comparable to what
audio budget measures so here at the
measurement of the rock second from
audio budget here mine and you can
immediately see there is this strange
peak at six kilohertz also heavily
boosted bass we are here around
seventeen DB more than compared to the
meets a normal response would be maybe
up to 10 DB this is already quite bass
heavy so 17 DB is really horrible
I will overlay the mint x5 here you can
see slightly less bass and the strange
peak has shifted to what 8 kilohertz so
it's not that nasty anymore it's not the
best sounding one but I think for those
who like bass it still somehow it gives
us a normal sound let's say a coherent
one why this is just oddly because of
this peak this is a 15 DB peak at 6 kilo
Hertz you could hear you get this this
whistling sound so I'm really not true
for me it sounds just broken I cannot
quite imagine how people can like sound
with this therefore yeah please avoid
comments like rocks you can is the best
I could even claim it's one of the worst
I've heard because it's just
unacceptable
the sound is somehow MIDI this peak
makes it appear very very shrill very
harsh and the bass is simply too much so
yeah this was my take on the rock second
definitely avoided don't go for the hype
the melt is not that great either but at
least it's somehow listenable
so I could listen to music with this
maybe I ought to us with some ambient
noise when it's loud you need a little
bit more of bass so with a flat tuned in
it will rather not sound that great so
the mint x5 is quite okay
Roxy of come definitely not yeah I hope
you like this I hope I could clear some
confusion up avoid the rocks you can by
all means it's just a horrible sounding
one thanks for watching and see in the
next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
