promised today I would like to do a
short comparison of the Bengal dogs and
we'll play one against the new a to
active of course you can also compare
them by also for the audio database or
switcher but I thought it might be
interesting as well to hear them live
through a video and some of you already
notice that I upgraded my equipment
slightly so the action cam I'm using now
is the Sony x3000 which I think has
slightly better image quality also
barrel distortion is fun of the strong
as it was before
especially the image stabilization is
much better as it's optical and the
other thing I upgraded was some
Lightning now as it's close to winter
and lightning outside is really dark I
thought I will need something I bought
an LED panel as you can see and I hope
it allows me to do also videos when the
Lightning on side is not that great as
usually I was really relying on the net
on natural lightning how it was outside
but now let's concentrate on the
speakers I would start with the a1
volume is about half and a kind of
smooth just like so please and listen
so how volume is where they are really
within their sweet spot
very - I come a bit closer
I think were the a1 has a slightly more
natural frequency response although
they're a to abuse a bit more spacious
and also deeper let's right now track
also more acoustic
I think you can hear the difference
quite well another flag
let's check the muscle of X's the a1
appears like in order but now the a tool
is more directional so it will be as
loud and the a1 projects more upwards
maybe let's try another track here you
should hear the difference quite well
we're a to definitely has the edge with
bass also travel is more pronounced
but the meets sounds somehow Hollow
he also the base is not as clean anymore
although we are only slightly about half
the a1 already starts traveling slightly
maybe another track where we can hear
some deep bass notes a little here they
can render them all in the first note is
barely livable but the a tool doesn't
really play it as well either I think
the first place not around 42 Hertz but
you can also hear the difference in the
overall frequency response
Samarra trek from princess freesia and
you can maybe check how they perform at
lower levels so I will reduce volume
slightly on the a2 as well I will reduce
it even lower
the a1 doesn't apply any loudest
compensation while the a2 active as
we've seen from the measurement has some
loudness adjustment for low level so at
low levels it will definitely sound a
bit better let's try maybe increasing
volume slightly sauce for more elevated
loudness levels and let's see how they
perform them they start to even out
slightly so the base advantage of the
atoll is starting to get lost
maybe not attract
some kind of lock
but the still sounds somehow clearer and
bigger
here's something else I have been
freshness is that a woman had slightly
more space punch also less than any
compression
I would increase volume even more
mmm
yeah I think we can hear that there he
won't sound less sauce yes sounds
slightly more full-bodied also a less
dynamic compression let's try not
attract some kind of dance track this is
the a1 now both apparel already closer
to maximum now there is not that much
difference anymore I will increase
volume to maximum on Bosh
a 1 as well
and what's interesting here is that the
a1 simply sounds louder or so more
dynamic with more bass so it's really
funny it's the smaller speaker with less
drivers let's try maybe another track to
get increase in volume to maximum only
way to follow combate maybe hear much
more dynamic sound from where a1 while
the end goal is this complaint
it's repressive not affect they warmed
really shines at high levels
so the a two while really something nice
for normal levels up to half simply
loses all its dynamics and also base at
higher levels why this sounds amino it
also has some stronger base reduction
but it seems as if it could perform or
keep the level much higher they could
have definitely boosted base for lower
levels to make it more comparable to the
a tool or even a bose soundlink mini but
obviously they really kept the base
level always at the same level the base
level at a level so yeah I mean it's a
mono speaker so you would need to to get
stellar sound you don't really get any
stereo sound out of this either but you
get this nice floating sound cloud it's
not really stereo but it gives you a
very nice spatial sound I mean that a
one is much cheaper the a two is
especially the new version the a two
active costs currently four hundred
dollars or bucks or euros or whatever
but the a one can already already be
found for around two hundred so by two
and you get a real stereo system even
much louder than one A two and I think
they sound great more natural the meets
are not as hollow as from the a to ten
as you've heard it's it keeps the level
somehow at high volume while this starts
to sound really a bit strange and thin
so I hope this could give you an idea
about difference between these two for
normal levels they're a tool really
shines but in this case I even prefer
that the leakage much more as it has an
equally natural frequency response like
they want but much better so
I'm not sure way where the a tool really
fits in especially with this battery
life it makes a mom it would play for
less than one hour why the a tool sorry
the a1 being louder place for more than
two hours at maximum yeah I mean if s
have the drivers we can try opening this
has just one full and driver in the
Twitter when this is two 4-inch drivers
to Twitter's and to basically eight as
this without basic creator I mean it's a
sealed system still manages this great
bass deep bass which is impressive so
maybe not forty Hertz but you will
definitely hear frequencies down to 50
Hertz 45 maybe with some placement
closer to wall you can also you can also
enhance bass likely or let hang it from
from the wall yeah how does it fit all
cannot find the right position
yeah I will do this later on yeah I hope
you liked it I hope the new lightning is
not too artificial but yeah I cannot
really do videos when it's so dark I
also switch to 30 P because 60 P or 50 P
in my case would be would increase noise
too much as the camera has to use double
the shutter speed therefore when
lightning is not as great I will switch
to 30 P otherwise the image will be too
noisy I think it's still a little bit
noisier then when sun is shining from
outside but currently it's really
horrible there is some some some fog and
rain and horrible weather typical for
November so yeah thanks all for watching
some big surprises are coming so stay
tuned and until then have a nice time
and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
