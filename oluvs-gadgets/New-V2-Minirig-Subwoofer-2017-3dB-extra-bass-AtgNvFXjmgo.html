borrow the numerix up yeah thanks Alvin
and some of you maybe noticed that music
released a new version of the mini recap
some weeks ago so now I have the chance
to really compare both mini reclaims it
to achieve a 3 DB loudness advantage
over the old one
of course I measure this and you can see
the new one in gray and the old one in
purple that even at low levels the new
one is slightly louder if we increase
volume the difference increases as well
and at maximum there is indeed exactly
and 3 DB different so I think it would
be quite interesting to hear them
side-by-side the old against the new
version also if this 3 DB loud as
difference is really noticeable I will
attach each of them to a cinema Nurik
and we can compare them like this
later on I thought let's compare it also
against the brand-new Ultimate Ears mega
blast mega blast yeah you can see
size-wise not that much difference still
many say it sounds great bass is great
but I think you will really hear the
difference as always I will use my
binaural microphones also a head cam you
should of course listen with headphones
this is the only way to listen to
binaural recording is correctly so
please put your headphones up and let's
have a listen I'm connected to both
musics from my iPhone so both act as a
separate 1.1 system on the left is the
numerix app on the right the old one
first let's have a listen at normal
levels if there is some difference and
the recording game is slightly lower
than usual as later on we'll also crank
them to maximum let's start with the new
one first
at low levels there is some slight
difference when you one definitely
sounds before yeah no no she's just a
song
I think that found his head about the
venue
not that much difference but I think
it's here about you really listen close
so it's done and higher go far away so
this is the new one and PC volume to
maximum you can hear how it keeps all
the pace
the old one
they definitely saltwater
you can hear the bass from doesn't have
this fullness
so these three DB are definitely here
over here
it's still great but then you won't
definitely has the
- impressive what you can achieve all of
a system that's more
rather hear the news
the difference is not huge but I think
it's hits here a ball so they did a
really great job already a great system
improving him more yeah it would be
interesting how such a system compares
maybe against a mega blast from Ultimate
Ears which I have here you can see
size-wise
not really that much difference the mini
Eric maybe 25% larger weight is I think
even lighter the mini Eric's yeah the
mega blast is quite heavy and price is
also similar so one point one system
costs 270 pounds which is around 310
euros so 299 10 10 or 11 euros more
expensive I will turn it on and we can
have listen how their data blast
compares to this go a bit far away again
it takes some time to elect no and let's
try another track again mini leagues
first volumes maybe around two thirds
now
and mega blood
yeah
the difference is selectively way nicer
let's write this Jamie puts funny this
was itself mega plus y this is a mini
rig well all the mini definitely a big
advantage in song
the Mega Bloks as well
no comment here
in the closet
it's for this I mean there is of course
some way to squeeze out face sort of
something a small but admit this is
seriously not really able yeah I mean
listen you cannot even hear a lower base
here
I think we spoke to maximum so this is
the one point one unit certainly
yeah
let's find all my thread like this
strange
so lyrics maybe two minerals together in
2.2 molds with one sub would have a
chance loudness wise but still they
sound way better what I would be
interested maybe is comparing two mini
explaining to point two against the
Pfeiffer boom stir here the new one
which is also quite loud but you can see
the size differences is really huge so I
will set it up in Google heavens now the
mimics a plane in Wireless terror in 2.1
mode and let's start this nestea farting
bass track let's try the quite
impressive what kind of pace they
squeeze out of this sheet here something
else
it's called faraway
I mean look at the size difference this
is very impressive
what we could do for Iowa versus switch
them to 2.0
let's increase their smell sign
name
he produces face-off
nothing else
volume ataxia mom
nice a serious
in a really nice song stage 6070 secured
a surprise
yes a little bit louder part est quite
impressive I mean look at the size and
weight difference I think we are still
below 2 kilograms for 2 min reeks with
with one sub while here we have three
and a half or something difference was
maybe not huge but it was definitely
noticeable so the new one gives a fuller
sound at high levels also at low there
was slightly more bass and it completely
destroyed the mega blast here mega mega
blast with mini sound I think it also
outperform the powerful booster slightly
but look at the size difference
so yeah it's unimpressive what linear
exquisite out of these small speakers
here and I'm sure we can expect lots of
surprises from them in future total boom
suppose maybe slightly louder but it
pushed me it's also way more hear the
sound remains really nicely constant
just with a little bit of edit
compression medium but loudness wise
really really impressive what you can
get below or around 2 kilograms here so
way better than really extreme and
everything else but of course it has its
price single mini requite sub course 270
pounds so around 310 euros pool system
with the cost of 450 I think you're not
cheap but really worth it I mean if you
consider also the battery life I have
tried to test it but it turned off after
2 hours at maximum I will have to test
it again because later on I could still
turn it on and tell you listen so maybe
just cut some peak which made their
battery yet shut the speaker down but
the sub would play for 8 or 9 hours so
it's really incredible I mean yeah it's
louder but you could hear the sound was
just yeah that was rather hurting then
making fun these are extremely fun
sounding yeah hope this was helpful new
mini Eric sub is definitely an
improvement and let's see what mini Ric
will bring us in future thanks a lot for
watching and see you then bye bye
you
mr. Malaysian Bassam nanum pass off the
sauce so how did the same old stand on
