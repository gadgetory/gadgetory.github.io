the bell was rung
wait, I am going
2 packets have arrived
wow, look
they are quite heavy
what do you think what that is?
let's have a look, wait I'll close the door
you should already be able to read this, what is written on it
do you want to try?
but these are numbers, not letters
here
but they are written together
yes, they are strange
SAXX is written here
yeah, comes from Sachsen
so which one do we open first, the small one?
no the... eh, I don't know which
wait, first I want to try this
here it is already: Saxx AS30
so, is this it? yeah...
ah, something is already playing
but this one doesn't play
so either you or me have wired something wrong
look, I haven't tightened it enough, so you were better
and what do we do then?
shall we place these on top of the others or here beside them?
we will manage somehow
but we have to replace this one, so that the others have more place
we will put them on top, they are nearly the same size
but I would place them beside
now let's try ours
and?
and? you have to tell me, you know your stuff
both sound
both sound the same?
just because these don't have any bass&quot;boomba&quot;
neither do the others have one
so, why is there an own bass&quot;boomba&quot; included with them?
we will unbox it now, wait
and why do these need a bass'boomba' and the others not?
so-so
where is the output?
how do you attach them?
there is an output
and here is an input
and?
it moves a lot
please be careful not to drop them!
and, does something move?
yes
and how do we place the bass&quot;boomba&quot; then?
usually it belongs close to the wall, but I currently don't have such a long wire
what's up Jazzy, do you like it?
but it doesn't move that much, does it?
do we want to put the cover on now?
no leave it like that, it's looking nice, I like it
I don't like it
wow, look how nicely it vibrates
but I want the cover
I think I made it too loud
here you can set the volume of the bassboomba
and also the upper frequency
you know what?
we put these also closer
which ones are playing now?
the white ones
sounds really strange
why?
don't you hear it? please give me the remote control!
this one?
yes please
which one is it now?
now it's the upper ones
these are the lower ones?
now, these are the upper ones
hmm
let's put them a bit more to the back
I think the subwoofer is a bit too much, heh?
a bit less...
and what's that?
let it, please put it back into the box
that's silica
it absorbs the humidity
put it into the box please
I must confess, I like the white ones more
I mean listen to this
you don't even have the option to control treble or something
that's sad
but in my room I have better &quot;boombas&quot;, right?
wow, cool music
Sophia will come soon
yeah she comes soon
the subwoofer makes nicely, doesn't it?
in my room I have better &quot;boombas&quot;, right?
yeah
in my room I also have two
two, yes
which ones do play now?
have a look which one move
the white ones
these are the black ones
yeah
they are a bit bassy
a bit bassy?
I will turn off the subwoofer
wow
does it move?
yes
go away
but not that much
so let's turn it off
hmm
not so close, come sit down at the sofa there
which ones are playing now?
the white ones
and now the black ones
the song that you like that much, which one is it?
the one at the very bottom
here was it
with the suboofer which ones are playing now?
with the subwoofer it will be better
you can see which ones are playing
I will turn down bass a bit, I think I set it to maximum
and which ones sound better?
these
these sound better?
why?
so
really?
let's turn on the bass&quot;boomba&quot; on again
the main button
which one is it?
the one knob that we pressed
now
it doesn't vibrate anymore
now the upper ones are playing
very well then! I think this was it
we have heard it
let's put everything back, turn off
and this one we will put to the wall, won't we?
exactly. and which one do you like more? the white ones or the black ones?
both
both? fair enough!
I'll have a look if mum is ready yet, ok?
how ready?
