lego technic set that I just discovered
I took the birthday of my son as an
excuse to get it as in reality I was
always completely governed by myself I
got my very first technic Lego set back
in 1981 and I simply couldn't resist
buying this one as well as it's a 40
years anniversary edition in 1977 and in
2017 1977 was when the very first
technique Lego set was introduced this
particular set here contains a model of
a track racer with malfunctions and
remote control as well as an alternative
model it because more than one hour to
build as my son helped me quite a bit
but you can definitely manage much
faster without the help of a
four-year-old the battery box powering
both engines takes city double-a
batteries there is also a receiver built
in and you get this more remote control
which has just two sticks for
controlling both engines one engine is
mounted at the front this one drives the
right track the other one is placed at
the rear and responsible to drive the
left track everything is pretty simple
so in reality there are no technical
amounts at all
but nevertheless I think the result
looks pretty cool and my son has lots of
fun driving the strange little race
around we try placing different
obstacles to see how this little fellow
will take them but also seeing drifting
it around on a slippery floor is quite
funny the racer is not the fastest but
thanks to this it's not that hard to
steer either although you definitely
have to get used to it first push the
left stick forward and you will power
the left track making the racer turn to
the right
if you push both sticks forward it will
drive straight ahead push one forward
the other one backward and the racer
will spin around like crazy
unfortunately the remote control works
only through infrared so you should have
a direct line of sight to the wagon all
the time despite this limitation the
remote control works still pretty nicely
although bound expect ultra long
operating distances as usual which level
this set wasn't cheap either but I
certainly didn't regret paying 80 euros
for it although my son might be a bit
too young for this set he still enjoys
it as much as I do so that we finally
decided to take off the body and mount
my action camera instead then we got
outside to see what the race I was
capable of in our wet and dirty garden
if you need some special present for
your son I'm sure he will love this as
much as we do I hope you also enjoyed
this update thanks a lot for watching
and bye bye
engines boom
misma here in shy I'm a big fan
ultimate on again
this kids technically</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
