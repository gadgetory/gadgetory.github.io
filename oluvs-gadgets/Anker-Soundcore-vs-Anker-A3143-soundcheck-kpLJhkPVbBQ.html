last time when I did my low-budget
speaker comparison we've also heard the
anchor premium bluetooth speaker the a
3143 but some asked me why I didn't
include the anchor sound or as well to
tell the truth I didn't know it before
some also asked if I could compare this
tool so here they are as you can see
both come in a pretty similar packaging
obviously this is corporate design of
anchor but there is not that much inside
the sound core there is no charger just
a charging cable the charging is done
through a micro USB so you can use any
charger you already have this is the
charging port auxiliary in microphone
and the speaker feels really nice you
can see the controls here on top but
sound wise I wouldn't quite put them in
the same class
we've heard that the anchor premium
speaker competes pretty well with more
expenses because like they both
Soundlink mini with nice punchy bass
while this has a clear and natural sound
but simply missing bass of course I did
a measurement and you can see that yeah
it measures indeed flat without any
obvious humps or something but bass
starts running off below 200 Hertz and
below hundred Hertz you get only yet
nothing or pod noise yet this is
supported design so this is not a
passive radiator but some port here
which you may hear some air flow coming
out at higher levels of course I would
like to show you how both sound I'm
using binaural microphones and you
should listen with headphones to get a
really realistic impression and I will
start with a funny kind of Russian Italo
disco track I really like Russian disco
music
I told Lana she russki druzy
yeah I can hear it what the anchor
sampler is missing on bass
the other one is missing and treble
there is also strong compression going
on at higher levels it doesn't play that
loud but you've heard that the premium
sounds a bit muffled I mean you can
always add some treble with equalizer
but you will never be able to add bass
to the sound core so if you like and
more heavy or let's see deep sound I
would I would definitely go for the
anchor premium speaker let's try another
track again with the sound co first a
mix of this school would be probably
perfect there's a nice clear sound but
simply no bass
let's try something else
enticing look good
maybe we should play some rep and start
turning them to maximum to see also the
loudness difference starting again with
their sound core and I'll open a cool
drink uh which brother story here's the
sky beat and sing kappa second today no
more than a friends come celebrate ships
more than a big fan so I say
imagine we have your place what you live
in today but the face was a real wasn't
of course I thought it might be also
interesting to hear how the anchor sound
compares against another low budget
speaker this is the mere tech or mirror
technique I don't know also available
under different brand names like sound
block I think and they usually go for 20
up to 30 dollars and you will probably
notice that there is not that much
difference so again starting with the
anchor sound core and another Russian
dance song
I will put them again far away and crank
both for maximum
maybe not trick
here the anchor is slightly louder
I think you could hear it definitely a
solid performer but you won't get that
much more sound out of it
than out of the usual chips because
compared against the anchor premium a
31:43 it sounds a bit lost although much
clearer and also cleaner sounding but
this overall sound I definitely prefer
the more full-bodied sound of the
premium speaker here yeah I hope this
could give you an idea about the sound
core nice device but nothing well
outstanding or special you can get
similar performance for even slightly
cheaper like the music has shown so
thanks again for watching and see you in
the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
