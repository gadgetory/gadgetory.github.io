they fief I think he compares against
some other common speakers smaller ones
bigger ones or very big ones like the
Peachtree deep blue over there I know
that the FIFA I think is a bit more
expensive than this it's about twice the
price of the Bose Soundlink mini for
example but the turbo X costs 300 in
Europe you can get the e-file sinky for
350 and many asked me how it compares
against the revised for example so I
thought we will do a short comparison
with all these speakers I thought will
try with the smallest ones then only buy
a mini and FIFA Helsinki first as you
can see I placed the Denver I mean front
there I think it has its main drivers
here somewhere so it shouldn't cover
anything as always i'm of course using
binaural microphones so you should
listen with headphones to hear the real
sound of these speakers i put them like
this to be really centered so you can
judge also some stereo imaging some
soundstage and so on and i will start
playing with deaf affairs in keep that
then environment is already playing it
up about 70 percent maybe why the FIFA I
think is still way below half volume but
let's all listen anyhow I hope we won't
have any noise outside well the weather
is pretty nice as you can see so all
bikers are outside and driving around
like crazy but has already said let's
start with Fu ing first
Damini you can hear pause sound pretty
balanced but the chief I think it is
even more open better bass its primary
track
it sounds a bit more muffled but the the
environment sounds really balanced I
mean for this size it's really a great
speaker definitely still one of the best
I would maybe even call it Amy
Helsinki or something but the FIFA you
heard it this is simple is if you're
listening play much more higher class
speaker now let's try the Bose Soundlink
mini the boss plays at around 60 65
percent so not very loud but you will
immediately hear that it already has
some problems I will play a jazz funk
track from resolution 88 again starting
with the F if I think you first
yeah it's all Marsh the base go of the
bass drum the hi-hat saxophone but the
most horrible thing is the bass drum is
rigged up it should sound like that
yeah this is simply no comparison let's
try a track from into savasana maybe I
like them because they have this really
nice strong mastering yeah you can also
hear your brother up I don't know
and very mushy sound if I again yeah we
should try the rear is the Reba s sounds
definitely better than the Bose
Soundlink mini but against the fever I
think it doesn't really have any chance
I'm starting again with the Fe fire
thank you first
you can hear that it's a little bit no
cupboard the Helsinki simply sounds is
if you were standing in front of the
recording I don't know
there's much more definition from the
favela stinky maybe we should try the
big brother the turbo X you can see I
place the one beside the other the turbo
X is simply too big so we've covered too
much of the Helsinki drivers and you
maybe already noticed that I increased
volume slightly on the river as compared
to the others that turbo X is even more
powerful so I increased volume even more
I'm starting with the effacing key first
again thanks to Trillium lab and nicely
staged in here there is no detail with
travel nothing maybe let's try another
track
yeah you've heard it there is some
tribal problem with the Travelex I
complained about this already from the
very beginning I hoped my replacement
would be better but it's even slightly
worse now let's try the Helsinki against
the big deep blue - yeah they both would
cost mall is the same the difference is
that the fever I think is much smaller
and portable so let's have a listen how
it compares against a huge monster deep
blue
if you ask me this sounds much more
balanced there is something up like
maybe some French rap
yeah people too has simply only bass and
treble but it doesn't sound really right
maybe we should check out how loud they
all can play so let's have a listen
although the reverse is set to power
mode it will be still much softer than
the few file syncing again if I think
you first
now although the reverse is better and
louder than the post on the community it
simply has no chance against a few Venky
let's try maybe the bigger turbo X you
can see turbo mode is enabled for the
turbo X so it plays at eleven out of ten
yeah let's see how loud it really is
compared to the few thousand key
yeah the turbo X is no slouch but it has
no chance against the Helsinki I hope
this video could give you a better idea
of the qualities of their previous inky
I think it's in a class of its own on
its own well I don't know but it's
simply in another class compared to most
this yeah I know the denim is much
cheaper as is the boss which costs half
the price but I mean this is all so much
you've heard it it's much louder it's
simply a much more high quality sound it
competes pretty well against the TOEFL
bumster as we've heard it's well nearly
as loud but much smaller the total boom
starways I think two times as much it
also sounds I would say better than the
deep blue - I'm really not impressed the
more I listen to it the less I like it
so it's a speaker that will be well
probably sold pretty quickly I don't
have any reason to keep it so yeah again
it will be hard to find anything
well better at this size it's not cheap
but it's a very decent and and
extraordinary speaker design yeah I know
it looks like a handbag but well I don't
care the sound is what matters so again
many asked how does it compare against
this against the other one here you have
it I hope you liked it yeah
see you in the next video and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
