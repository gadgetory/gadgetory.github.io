compare that brand new JBL charge 3
against the Bose Soundlink mini to the
JBL should go for around hundred 49 this
199 the JBL is completely waterproof it
can also charge external devices it's a
pretty rugged outdoor model it can be
paired with another one for wireless
stereo
it can also be paired with a JBL extreme
a JBL pass to flip 3 and so on so i
think it has a bit more features than
the bows but i already see all the
complaints saying well but the boss is
much smaller so you cannot compare this
to this is unfair just like it was with
the JBL extreme and the mega boom also
because the mega ohm is so much smaller
and lighter and therefore not quite
comparable therefore i grabbed at both
sounding 3 as well and we will compare
these two later on first we'll start of
course comparing the JBL charge 3
against the Soundlink mini 2 this will
be quite a short comparison as the bose
simply cannot quite compete as always
i'm of course using high quality
binaural microphones so you really
should listen with headphones and i will
start with a track from soul persona the
same i used for the blind listening test
of the river s giveaway maybe this will
help you to judge her the sound a bit
better so let's start with the JBL
charge 3
the Bose
I think it sounds quite a bit more
powerful maybe let's try this also quite
a heavy tracks the Soundlink mini always
Stratos with this
both get sensitive atomo undefined
near this sounds much larger just as the
size suggests now let's check out how
loud both can play well no comment
the boss is really maximum I mean can
see if this doesn't go any louder
yeah maybe we should check the sounding
three no that ball sounding three wants
to be some kind of premium model at
least this is what boss tries to suggest
you they even increase the price to 330
euros in Europe lately so it's twice the
price of the JBL charge three let's have
a listen how these two compare Oh what's
this ring what's happening with the base
here
yet the table is clean
the basis unless with the boat
it's fine on a trick
those also hear some droning and pumping
maybe some smooth jazz those
yeah I think the JBL still sounds more
convincing but Bose is known for being
well natural sounding at least everyone
is claiming this so let's have a listen
how it compares with a more acoustic
track again starting with their JBL
charge three let both should render this
pretty well I think
not that both what's this man is
unusable if you ask me are in business
so yeah I think I know which one is more
natural
this isn't banana crack
they're also calling here unusable
horrible
leave this leave some deep house or
something do what I like about the JDL
at this so control it does not distort
let's try the boss what's this
no I think this is simply a feature
maybe some other house here's some nice
thumping bass run the post this is close
for sounding distorted
yet maybe we should put them a little
bit far away and crank them higher maybe
some will remember the following song it
has two bass notes a higher note and the
lower note the low note should be around
52 and for maximum
yeah I can hear the following people
charge three songs and all we find is
fight playing at maximum
suppose it's not disappearing slightly
maybe another
yet the charge tree is definitely louder
and more punchy than the boss the boss
is missing any lower base no punch from
the base remapping
maybe a rock Trek
Paul should be good with rockets well
maybe not
suppose no it's not good with the rock
it's enough of something
the Bose again no Boston three to help
it doesn't really sound good with
anything I'm not sure if it makes sense
to lose any further words but you've
heard it this is Los Llanos although
it's pretty blatant to ask so much money
for a speaker that distorts with every
second song that JBL played them all
clean with more punch although at very
high levels there were maybe some first
hints of intermodulation there's
something me too had no chance loudness
wise it's a bit of a joke I mean this
sounded twice as loud and still cleaner
without any kind of strong dynamic
compression of course there is some
slight compression limiting but fan of
this extremis and the Bose Soundlink
mini - and also the sounding three it
sounds horrible at maximum so I'm not
quite sure if I should really comment
anymore that comparison should have
shown you which one is better yeah of
course many more comparisons are coming
soon so please stay tuned until then
have a nice time thanks for watching and
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
