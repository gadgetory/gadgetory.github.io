a speaker from blitz wolf a pretty
German name blitz valve I was contacted
by them if I would like to review one of
theirs because they have three
difference because the f1 f2 and f3 and
I thought that if want to be the most
interesting one it's available in three
different colors and it reminds me a bit
of the mini jambox so here it is let's
open it comes in a pretty simple
packaging but the speaker itself is is
really nice it's made out of aluminum so
really nice precious finish here let's
see what else is inside the box yeah
nothing just some wires and a carrying
loop or something I think you can yeah
there is something here so you can
attach it and carry it around we have
below a flap is a microUSB charging port
and auxiliary in so let's turn it on
nice tones no Chaka boom and of course
we can have a listen for the sounds I
have prepared some tracks from Saltair
freesia what is so far is alia this is
all persona together with Princess
freesia so it's probably Salter freesia
and let's have a listen
we have some play stop button here the
volume buttons also act for track
speaking skipping if you keep them
pressed it changes volume if pressing
shortly you skip tracks and of course
you would like to know how it sounds
compared to some other speakers
low-budget once I have the anchor sound
cohere and we can have a listen how
these two compare that Indian village
which sounds quite a bit clearer not
that much space both are pretty light on
bass but it's still pretty punchy
no trick
however increased volume to maximum both
to see how long they can play both are
pretty loud but I think there is a bit
of a lost potential I will start my
equalizer app and I think there is much
more possible to get out of the blitz
wolf so let's try on lower levels
I will definitely add a bit of bass I am
at 85 Hertz here and I will simply post
it as much as possible but we will have
to go down with the game with the input
game otherwise it will distort so let's
go down 10 degree and I boosted 84 Hertz
he flipped in MTB and now let's do the
same with treble
i boosted 8 kilohertz around 10 DB and
let's switch between EQ and not know you
yeah I think this is a quite a
difference
for lower levels like this it will
definitely get along with a bit more
bass and treble because like this it
sounds quite a bit yeah
so I'm not even flat but simply let's
find our track okay I think what you
hear here is it vibrates a bit we would
need some pillow probably or something I
don't know how to put it
maybe yeah let's take this the sting
here gets better now
you can hear it eggs 15 DB bass boost
with a problem and sounds much better
with some basic very mature sound I will
deactivate equalizer and switch over to
the anchor sound core let's have a
listen to both again and now the blitz
wolf with equalizer so you hear there is
some potential I will take great
equalizer again let's tip let's simply
there are some rubber feet here but it
would probably need even more softer and
different feet to avoid any vibration
this should be adjusted dynamically so
if I reduce base I can increase volume
at the same time yeah but most
manufacturers simply save on on a DSP
inside but this thing would definitely
need some kind of DSP which adjusts and
keeps the base always had maximum balls
and then on everyone does the same you
can hear it sounds it can play pretty
loud but the bass is not there it would
need to be boosted at low levels
otherwise I mean a pretty nice speaker
but missing quite a bit of refinement to
the sound
I will definitely add some treble boost
and also some dynamic bass boost to make
it sound pretty good and full-bodied at
low levels as well I think it's a great
design and really promising but it would
need a little bit of work I don't know
if there is a deep insight or not but
many Bluetooth chips in the meantime
have DSPs so it shouldn't be such a
problem yeah thanks to blitz wall for
offering me this sample here I hope you
liked this video you can buy the it's
wolf from their site or even from Amazon
the link is in the description
yeah thanks for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
