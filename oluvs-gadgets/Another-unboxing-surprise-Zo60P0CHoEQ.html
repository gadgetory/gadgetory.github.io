surprise well usually I'm not that kind
of unboxing type of guy there are better
channels in mind like for example
unbox therapy who is probably doing this
for living but I got this interesting
package from Taiwan yesterday and I
thought it might be interesting for you
as well
to have a look what is inside it's from
a company called Celia and para I've
never heard from them before but one
comment I'd YouTube claimed that he
heard this in a store and he compared it
against the bill 815 against the jail
extreme and this speaker from Silla and
para sounded the best therefore I
contacted the company and some nice
Richard responded and sent me this
sample immediately so let's have a look
inside I will of course wear my head cam
to give you a kind of life impression
and also my binaural microphone so
please put up your headphones and we
will have a look inside I'm really
curious to what expect
so it's the Sevilla para Syria and para
P for a wooden speaker reminds me a
little bit of the audio dynamics or Eva
blue but I think this one is bigger more
serious let's have a look so it is
Bluetooth NFC eight hours battery life a
strapless included handcraft and
bentwood you can have a look at their
side I have no idea about availability
in well in Europe and in America
I don't know but according to Richard it
should well they're currently opening
some kind of shop web online shop so
let's pull it out this baby yeah this is
really it's a kind of premium look and
so this is the speaker let's have a look
at the access of accessories
fire it is the strap and the adapter I'm
not very big
I hope it's charged a little bit so we
can give it a try in EDP
I will leave the strap here maybe we can
mount it and here the speaker wrapped
into some nice bag yeah this is no
plastic this is really Wow feels like
some instrument like my piano or
something
this feels really great
okay I don't understand the word but it
should be easy as you can see you have
the twitters here at the sides and I
think two main drivers and one passive
radiator this is the power button
connect to it
it should appear in my list or I should
force Bluetooth ah here it is C and P
audio p4 and let's try a track from
cable a synthesizer rose
I think the speaker needs a bit more
distance to really come alive
unfortunately the volume control
produces this is tall
of course without any comparison it's
hard to judge the sound I mean taken
alone it's it's pretty pretty decent
let's have a listen to the audio Pro t3
how this Suns compared I should be
already connected here then we can do
some switching
maybe let's listen to something else
something more well more common more
normal yeah as always mr. soll persona
the three sounds a bit small this sounds
really big huge speaker okay the tones
are a little bit annoying but yeah
interesting two mounted Twitter's on the
sides
let's try touching the strap maybe hmm
okay you have probably here unscrew this
I hope it's visible I have no idea what
the camera is filming sometimes yeah I
think I have the speaker framed in the
center but in reality it's out of frame
so sorry if not everything is visible
but it's really hard to judge with the
head cam I could yeah I could make it
remotely with some remote display
Wireless but I have lots of problems
with this
I lost really many recordings because
suddenly when the connection get lost
the camera doesn't record anything
anymore and I realized this only
afterwards so well yeah this is pretty
nice speaker yeah really really decent
and thanks to Richard for sending this I
will do of course more tests I have no
idea about the price I heard something
between five hundred six hundred dollars
so it's not a cheap speaker it's not at
both so it really competes with with the
more premium category what we have your
auxiliary volume buttons at least
charging out and DC in so I hope you
liked this little unboxing yeah and stay
stay tuned for more tests of the syria
and para p4 thanks for watching and bye
bye
okay so here for all those who really
watch until the very end or who skip
until the end just a short sneak of the
Celia in para P for against the fool
Excel which sounds so bad according to
many commenters on YouTube let's have a
listen the P for will play first
of course the p4 can play much louder
but yeah just a short first impression</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
