is a Bluetooth speaker I know that unbox
therapy has recently released a video
about the smallest bluetooth speaker I'm
not sure if this is any bigger but I
have to defend myself as I had all of
this quite a bit before his video as you
can hear maybe I'm a bit sick so I
didn't have time to show it to you but
here it is this is from pong box I found
it on Amazon for around $15 and it's
available in black blue and gold like
this which looks pretty decent I think
it has also a kind of selfie trigger we
can try this out yeah yeah it works as
you can see but of course I thought we
would like to know how it sounds
I mean is this not a great sounding
speaker can't expect anything decent for
$15 but I was nevertheless impressed how
nice it sounds for this size so let's
have a listen I'm always using binaural
microphones so you should listen to
headphones please put them up and let's
check it out the sound is a little bit
directional so if you any direct EQ the
treble becomes better
I have another no name stop here also
around $15 I think let's listen how this
song yes and despite having an
unspecified Atta and being quite a bit
bigger it doesn't sound really better
the place is a bit better but it's it
has some harshness let's try a dance
track and I will turn both for maximum
yeah it's pretty loud impressive for the
size this one by breakfast crazy so they
take the sparseness doesn't come back
good
technically most less than political
of course
hello again because like the JBL go
but you could hear that loud as wise the
difference is not that much I mean that
JBL is also quite a bit larger maybe
four or five times but I think they
didn't use the whole potential this
thing can really play 80 Hertz at
maximum volume which is impressive so
here we have 18 where is it but of
course let's say hundred maybe not
eighty and it does not distort so it
would have potential to if you raise
base a bit at low levels of course I
tried this I have an EQ curve
I raised 80 Hertz with about 5 dB
so for lower levels this should work
pretty well let's have a listen to a
song from some persona with and without
the e kuu this long without and I will
turn on the cue
it becomes a little bit more full-bodied
it will definitely sound better at low
levels becomes a bit more full-bodied
also if you place it on a cloth
this will increase basic more as you can
see I have the EQ turned on and it does
not restored
I will turn off the queue again there
seems to be some compressor inside which
prevents Distortion even if you raise 80
Hertz like I did so I think it's a
pretty nice speaker for the size I mean
it could have been even better if they
will edit some DSP and so on but maybe
it wouldn't be possible to offer it for
$15 it comes in a packaging like this so
you can see there is some loop included
that you can put in here and and yeah
carry it or let it hang somewhere it
also comes with a non USB wire so you
don't need any adapter or some other
wire but simply normal microUSB I think
for $15 a pretty decent also this is old
metal aluminium so this is really
high-quality for that price it doesn't
sound great but you've heard its
listenable we can compare it for example
against how it sounds against against
the iPhone let's try the the then strike
again or this one
and this is the internal speaker of the
iPhone at maximum volume already so this
is definitely much better than the
internal speakers you could use it as
some keychain or something really really
not bad I hope you like this video I
hope it was helpful for anyone who wants
a gift for a friend or something this
should definitely do the trick as it's a
nice high quality speaker you see this
is no cheap stuff but really really nice
so thanks for watching and I hope I can
come up with more videos when I'm not
sick anymore have a nice time and bye
bye of course this would be better
aimed at me like that
a heart is net Ostia chest nope your
