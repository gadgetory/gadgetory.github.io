a lot for your support and for your
confidence I wouldn't have expected such
a high ran and interest in that Olaf
special edition event Wireless in years
because the initial plan was to just
release hundred units only this was a
spontaneous decision by the CIO he
wanted to offer something for my
followers for my fans for all those who
trust and very my opinion but the
response and feedback was quite
unexpected so in the meantime they
released the third run of 100 so more
than 200 to only sold which of course is
quite impressive and I would like to
thank you I don't want you to buy some
peak in a poke I didn't provide you any
sound samples not because I wanted to
hide something because I didn't have
time we wanted to get to rush this
campaign a little bit so I just prepared
a simple introduction video but didn't
have enough time to prepare valid sound
samples it's not that I just put them in
press record and I already have
something valid it's a lot of work to
record in years and get reasonable
results therefore I sit down yesterday
for some hours try to do some further
measurements or some recordings so that
you know what to expect from it keep in
mind this is just a recording so you
will probably hear something different
but compared to some other one like the
anchor and solar Liberty glass you
should get an idea about the tonality of
my tuning or what I intended first I
would like to show you how it sounds raw
without any tuning I will play analogue
from savasana and princess creature at
the beginning you will hear the audio
recording and then the ante on diversion
I think you'd hear the wrong response is
already quite smooth but it's to Bumi
and muddy at the same time therefore I
wanted to bring it to something more
normal something first I would like to
show you some measurements here in green
the wrong response and in black my tuned
one so what did I do
you can see i reduced bass mostly mid
and upper base while living lower base
untouched
I also boosted the area around 3
kilohertz this is the natural peak that
every Indian should have and you can see
I also adjusted travel a little bit just
for reference I will overlay the
response of a sony MH one here and you
can see that the overall tonality is
quite similar so now let's listen again
how it sounds after tuning again with
analog as a reference track
I hope you could hear that now after the
tuning it sounds way better still not
like the audio recording but I think it
gives this natural appealing sound with
some bass emphasis also treble emphasis
and let's compare it against another
true Alice in ear I only have the Zolo
Liberty Plaza from Anka here we could
compare it made against some more
expensive ones in my final review this
is just to give you a better idea about
the sound so the donor Liberty Plaza is
quite okay I like it it has some user
adjustable equalizer presets I can't
remember I think I used yes because the
flat one sounds a bit off it's also I
think hundred 120 euros so more than
twice the price so let's compare these
two with my usual test tracks and at the
end we can maybe discuss a bit further
so let's check them out
is it just a dream
my love a man-size my fantasy call to me
you are is my thoughts and ever straight
from the heart of
am i touching you I wanna feel
yes oh please tell me your opinion I
think that the Iran special edition
sounds quite a bit better than the end
cards oh no Liberty PLAs not as boxy
although keep in mind that Zola Liberty
PLAs is already quite a decent sounding
one and like the end of some people I
hate that we've heard which sounds
horrible I could have used this I don't
have it at home but I have recorded it
but it would be a bit unfair so I
compared it to some really crappy
sounding on the dollar Liberty PLAs is
not that but I think that if an easily
outperforms it sound wise it's a
smoother response a more natural
response without this strange boxiness
we could have maybe compared it against
the samsung galaxy bars but I don't have
them at home also they sound best with
this dynamic EQ which I cannot set from
an iPhone so with the standard stock
tuning they also sound way too harsh and
and honky so I think I didn't disappoint
you
just wanted to give an idea what to
expect so you don't buy the peak in the
Polk cut same suck how you saying German
and quite satisfied I'm still waiting
for the final version so that I can have
a listen again and there will be an
option to to readjust to do some slight
readjustment in case the final one
doesn't sound like I intend it so it's a
really nice not because I had some
influence on this I say this because I'm
satisfied with it you know I have quite
a high standard I don't like all this
height crap I call h1 sin God the D gbb
and added a sound crappy to me they
don't sound great they don't so I don't
quite cannot follow the hype why I think
that this sounds really decent they are
not perfect by no means so they are
definitely way better sounding in years
I mean but I currently have also the
automatic er-2 XR I also ordered the SD
version because the XR is a little bit
bass IV which is surprising this is the
first automatic which has
some really basic forces and I wanted to
compare both yeah I will try to do a
review on the a thematic as well so
tonality wise they are not far off and
this is what what counts for me the
tonality must be must be okay if some
particular frequency is boosted too much
it sounds off especially if it's peaky
if you get some some narrow peak and
these don't have these Peaks it's a
smooth response a little bit more bass a
little bit maybe more treble but smooth
treble with no harshness so I think
there's very great not because I was
somehow influenced because I think this
is how an in-ear yeah short sound maybe
it could be it could have been improved
even further but with really not too
extreme adjustments I think this is as
good as you can as you can go
battery life I haven't tested it yet
because so far I wanted to wait for the
final version so that I can use it with
my phone too you know because like this
they are an tuned I don't like the sound
it could hear muddy and and to boo me
but as soon as I get the final version I
will try to get hold of some maybe some
Bose sound sports 2 LS or the sennheiser
momentum to wireless and we will compare
these two but what I like the box is
quite light so not half the weight but
way lighter than this they are also
quite light and comfortable by
themselves the tips are comfortable I
have no problems also with the with the
sound of the tips because usually the
tips influence the sound quite a lot
these already sound great for example
you can remember the trivet x1 that i
revealed some time ago it needs
different tips for sound good while this
sounds really great with your general
ones yeah I think this was it thanks
again for all those who somehow trusted
me or trusted my my opinion I hope this
little sound demo
could give you a more a better idea
about what to expect from them and maybe
you can sell even more and if this
become successful earphone already
invited me to China so yeah maybe there
will be some collaboration for future
products as well who knows
what future will bring but so far I
recommend that you fan all of specially
different to anyone who likes or who
longs for another correct response it's
not correct by hundred percent but I
think it sounds simply true and and not
of in any way like many others we had
from the deluxe and I don't quite
understand I mean these are real
engineers tone masters or whatever I'm
just some wanker playing around and I
cannot quite follow what he don't manage
a normal response for this taste I'm
just off the same with the Sennheiser we
will hear that that momentum to Alice
and they asked 300 euros or 280 or
something for it
so yeah don't want to bore you just
wanted to make this video because I was
already criticized that I didn't provide
any sound samples this was just because
there was not enough time we had a tight
schedule to release this I had some half
an hour to present this now I sat down
again yesterday tried to do some
recordings and this is the outcome but
it can keep the sound Sam is always
other great and with a little bit of a
grain of salt
don't take them absolutely rather also
relatively to the original recording but
it's only a recording and it's not that
easy to record in ears to begin with
yeah another one I would like to present
you is our new come here come here
Jimmy our new baby
we have also Daisy she's currently
sleeping but Jim is with me here
after Jesse and Roxy died
we had to immediately take two new ones
because a life without dog is not a real
life hmm
so thanks a lot again and see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
