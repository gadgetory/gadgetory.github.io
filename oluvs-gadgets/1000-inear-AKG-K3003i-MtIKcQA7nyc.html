show you quite an expensive in-ear
headphone maybe one of the most
expensive ones I've ever heard this is
the AKG K 0:03 it's not that new anymore
actually quite old I think more than 10
years old so it was raised around 2005
but back then it was regarded as some
kind of pioneer for the hybrid
technology so one dynamic driver to
balanced armature drivers there was
nothing like that back then also some
exchangeable filters to tune the sound
also quite unique but you can still find
it on Amazon for $1,200 so really steep
I got it from a friend it's not some
fake it's really general back from then
when AKG was still an Austrian company
here located in Vienna and now they
moved to China dismissed all employees
but he got it from one ex-employee
and yeah I wanted to have a listen so I
asked him if I could have it now I have
a little bit broader overview about in
years especially cheaper ones never
heard such expensive ones but I'm
shocked how bad it actually is and how
can they still ask so much money for it
but let's look inside I don't have the
original packaging you just gave me this
box here these are the India's some
remote control a Haji written on it the
cable is not suable also lots of
different tips I don't find them that
comfortable and the first thing I
noticed when I put it in there is this
typical crackling when you when you
cause some pressure on the driver so
really cheap there should be some port
to you have to take down to take off
this pressure but you put it in and
immediately here is crackling I also get
this from the Sony MH one but I mean
this is $1200 in here so it should at
least perform really well it's quite
heavy
made of metal wire is okay here it's
kind of fabric the upper part is rubber
and let's a look at those filters it
comes with three different filter sets
reference filter this is this one so you
screw it down take another one there is
also a base filter and a treble filter
before looking at those measurements
maybe let's have a listen first and I
was really not sure which in here I
should use for comparison the
because it sound just yeah I don't want
to talk that much I will let me see
which one is left it's this is right
this is left I will let you listen and
let's compare it against the sony image
one which i think is the cheapest with
the greatest sound so the price
performance ratio is really high on this
yeah and after listening we will discuss
a little bit the results also check out
some frequency response measurements so
first the AKG K 303 then there's on
image one and at the very end you will
hear the original track just for
reference so that you know how it should
sound so
yeah just horrible
with one single word horrible first of
all the drivers are not matched well so
the left one has slightly less space or
more based on the right one let's simply
check the frequency response
measurements I will Everage both
channels and the black one is the
reference curve as you can see some
treble peak here at 12 kilo Hertz really
a little bit too much the treble filter
has this strong boost in the seven six
kilohertz region really horrible why the
base filter yeah puts everything down
but there is still this treble peak if I
overlay the Sony image one here it has a
much smoother response overall less
upper treble less travel in the three
four five QRS region bass is more less
the same although the AKG somehow
appears thinner sounding for the
recording press on its soundless just
unacceptable the sound I'm not quite
sure how this could get rating videos I
saw some reviews from really great
popular magazines claiming it to be
great maybe ten years ago this was
regarded as great the sound but there is
this boost between five and seven kilo
Hertz which is just it's not a natural
response so yeah I'm shocked I'm really
how bad this is the end it's not a fake
really it's he got it directly from from
some former employee mmm I know they had
problems when they moved to China there
were some quality problems but this is
still one from from Australia so really
an original Austrian quality in here by
the way EKGs are highly regarded but I
have still to here a really great
sounding AKG headphone
I have one and over here the 612 I think
maybe I will do a comparison between the
three popular brands Sennheiser EKG and
biodynamic my biodynamic DT 880 should
arrive today so we can maybe compare
these three because I think a kitchen is
completely overrated I have ready to
hear a great nice sounding head
form from here let alone in here so
spending thousand dollars for this is
really is crazy crazy I mean you can't
get this son for less than $10 of course
there can be some fake ones but by a
hundred of them and there would be
definitely one which sounds perfect
there is definitely some sample
variation but you could hear here as
well the left channel
let me see was it the left had more bass
than the right one really really strange
and this filter changing so a huge huge
letdown this 80g here especially for the
price if it was some $50 okay I could
accept it
all those case it something don't sound
better overs but four thousand dollars
this is just I mean unbelievable really
really so yeah my take on the AKG K 300
three just to show you also that price
doesn't have nothing in common with
sound quality there are headphones which
can cost five thousand dollars that
sound worse than a hundred that I have
found simply because it's not about the
price it's about the air the rent lots
of development into the image one simply
to make it perfect for this given price
I think they wanted to offer it as low
as possible I will again post a link to
the thread where the original developer
of the Sony image one talked how how it
was developed how what the intention was
and so on and they offered it for cheap
while I don't know what the intention of
AKG was maybe to make lots of money out
of it and there are definitely people
who bought it let me see there are some
reviews on Amazon hey it's got many well
four and a half that magnificent and
make me fish if this is magnificent
what's the solid and crap or what make
niche and what else the sound is great
with an amplifier okay I should have
Houston aim for this for a portable yeah
sure so don't let let you fool with buy
some price and an expensive in earr like
this Andromeda or whatever doesn't need
to sound good it doesn't sound good
there's still many who claim it does but
it doesn't therefore it's not the price
it's rather the tuning the the know-how
which stands behind it I'm not sure what
kind of know-how is behind this because
it sounds really creepy yeah there were
maybe the first who who who had this
hybrid technology with dynamic drivers
mix well-balanced amateur later on
everyone made this so I'm really
disappointed it's it's quite shocked how
bad it actually is and I really don't
want to hear the Sennheiser ie
800 because it's probably even that you
had the same I saw some measurements of
the Sennheiser and and it looked just as
crappy so the price has nothing to do
with quality especially quality of sound
with in ears and headphones it's maybe
even more than with speakers but there
are speakers $400,000.00 some strange
full range German companies only one
driver which sounds horrible and they
are still asking that my foot and people
and they are getting praised by many
magazines I'm not sure how this works
maybe it's some some money you know give
me $5,000 and I will review this really
highly but I am they tried to be as
honest as unbiased as possible and if I
had bought it I would be who would have
been shocked how bad it is actually
thank goodness my friend didn't pay for
it either he got it from this was maybe
some some stock some rest but it's just
unacceptable what what what is offered
here and I really if I had the
connections I would try all those
expensive ones because I'm pretty sure
that 90% of those are just yeah
unacceptable as well so just wanted to
give you this this the shot idea about
how $1000 in you're concerned how crappy
it can sound compared to a very cheap
one yet are still people yeah my anomaly
whatever man eh-eh-eh-eh sounds better
than this yeah if you think so then
maybe your ears you should clean your
ears a little petrol
so it's not the best sounding one but
for this price for this what it is it
cannot be any any better quality control
maybe also sample variation is a bit
high I have seven or eight of them and
all sound a bit different so you never
know what you are getting but by hundred
of them so you will have the same price
as for the EKG and one of them will be
definitely definitely perfect yeah
nothing has to say maybe I will have the
chance to to use some other expensive
ones but I rather won't I want to
concentrate on the more reasonable
priced ones up to 100 maybe 200 dollars
I ordered this automatic AR 4 XR as I
simply wanted to have this extra over
the ER 3 XR although many claim that it
sounds the same but I also heard that
the ER 4 XR sound still a little bit you
get this 5% and I just wanted this 5% so
for less than $300 this is the most I
would spend for an in-ear yet many more
are coming not as expensive phones but
quite interesting ones some really hyped
raved ones so we will see if the raving
is really deserved thanks for watching
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
