to check out a speaker that is not that
well known because it's only available
in Germany from a German company called
best beans the speaker is called fashion
white you can see it in the German
Amazon store for 39 euros there are lots
of great reviews most impressed by the
sound others complain about the battery
which has some self discharging I had it
forgotten completely in my cellar for
several months now and before putting it
back again I thought I will do a
giveaway but first let's have a listen
to it yeah it has SD card play back here
charging is done from microUSB this is
the packaging so it is like new I have
never used it and it doesn't sound bad
but in the mean time I think there are
better speakers yeah already connected
and I thought we'll compare it against
the Xiaomi me here
why definitely my favorite in this class
then me has also SD card playback it's a
bit smaller and yeah let's have a listen
as always I'm using binaural microphones
so you should listen to headphones I
will start playing with the fashion
white then switch over to the me and so
on so please have a listen
I think you can hear their new sounds
richer it's not bad it sounds like a
small speaker not rec and it's
definitely better than their JBL go and
all the others but it doesn't have this
particularly great song of the need them
is definitely more refined better days
I'm not sure I don't think that volume
is synced not obviously not but it's
already set to maximum so we can change
volume from the iPhone now this is when
I change volume here it also changes on
the iPhone but this one's definitely
much more mature
maybe let's try lower levels I will
reduce volume slightly to get the kind
of background listening effect and this
becomes thinner and thinner while in
rate it doesn't become thinner but it
appears thin to the human ear while they
show me it's quite a bit of bass for low
levels
maybe not attract some kind of let's try
this doesn't make fun but this need
still
Nicholas Rice's and I will increase
volume to maximum both shouting display
now
nefesh and white as well as you can hear
the fact it's softer than they me and
the me has some slight compression
effects also distorts a little bit more
but still appears louder maybe let's try
another track again increasing volume to
maximum yeah I think overall the meat
does a better job involved eight become
quite comparable at maximum so yeah I
mean it's not a bad speaker but in the
meantime there are simply better ones
like this me which is even smaller
equally slim let's say but I would like
to give it away because I don't have any
need for it and I don't want to sell it
I mean it doesn't make sense therefore I
would like to know from you which
speaker does look exactly the same
I already made a review about it it's a
bigger version from another company but
looks exactly the same
check some of my older videos and then
please send me an email with the speaker
name send me an email to all of Skagit
at gmail.com and everyone who every one
of my subscribers who sends me the right
answer yeah we'll be finally chosen in a
raffle to win the speaker I mean it's
nothing extraordinary particular but it
I think it looks really interesting has
nice build quality
and it's really nice also thanks to this
SD card playback not many speakers
currently still offer SD card playback I
really like this feature because I
always have some SD card inside the show
me here so I will disable Bluetooth and
then I can I can start some music there
is a card inside but doesn't always work
this is the demonstration effect let's
try it again
now it should ah it does but it was
turned - yeah - low volume so yeah I
hope you liked the speaker those who
will win it or that one who will win it
and I'm going for a holiday so after I
returned this will be around 20th of
September I will do the raffle and yeah
until then yeah thanks for watching have
a nice time and I will see us later in
after my holidays I hope you have a nice
time as well and yeah we'll see us then
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
