here I have that tall Tronics boom X
well no not really
here it says either or Acer HSR 13 and
obviously is from some German rebadge
company called is Matt which offers the
same speaker under a different brand
name currently the Iser is only
available on the German Amazon store for
15 euros in two different colours here
we have the taotronics boom X for $51
and they both look exactly the same just
like we had with with the Blitz wolf and
with the easyacc of course I cannot say
if the eyes are really sounds the same
as the taotronics boom X but all of
these the eyes are the anchor premium
the gem heavy metal the v10 roller
roller and also the cyclonic share lots
of internals we will see for example if
we turn it on first let's turn on the
anchor the Iser and the written roller
and the gem here metal all have the same
tones even when looking at the frequency
response measurements of all of these
here we have the ISO first than the gem
heavy metal and finally they have it in
royal you can see that they measure
quite similar of course there is some
difference in overall tuning but the
only one which doesn't quite fit in is
the anchor so when matching the anchor
to with base to the other ones you can
see that the only big difference is that
the anchor has some really strong meets
emphasis there is some hump in the mid
section but otherwise it would probably
sound exactly the same like the others
and many say that the anchor sounds
muffled but this comes probably because
of this meet hump of course yeah we will
have a listen how both compare if yeah
it's really worth 15 euros or dollars of
course I'm not sure if that all tronic
sounds the same but I assume it does or
at least very similar I will start with
the track from soul beverages latest
album called Stella sonic and I will
play with the
first as always of course I'm using
binaural microphones so please listen
headphones so let's get started yeah
something's not right here you can hear
that this sounds are well more true
let's say it is also slightly louder
because of the needs I will try to match
the Navigator and maybe a knock-back
soul pair freesia again princess region
workouts with soul persona doing all the
arrangement and so on
wanker you can get the same artifacts
with bass here this Heiser again above
the bass sound smooth us somehow another
fact I'm kept yack
and it still appears out there somehow
yeah because here the mids are slightly
skipped out while they anchor posts them
we can probably hear that apart from the
midsection they both sound pretty
similar let's try another track and this
is the problem I will switch over to the
anchor it appears a bit muffled a
problem is again low levels I will
reduce volume and stick it a bit to my
ear and you get these typical artifacts
at low levels some kind of a demo site
noises the anchor doesn't do this at
least my unit not but my first unit had
exactly the same problem so you see even
such small details you have you really
have to increase volume quite a bit to
get rid of this now it's gone but at
very low levels I will start again it
sounds like some some effect or
something so the eyes are definitely
definitely suffers a lot from this that
Jam heavy metal did the same the victim
Roy Roy LR didn't do this but all of
them seem to have the same problem maybe
depends also on well
which series you have which kind of I
don't know but generally I prefer of
course the tuning of the ISO and if not
the low-level artifacts I would
recommend it I recommend it as it has a
nice balls like tuning then let's try
another track I can hear it sounds very
very exciting nice bass nice treble the
anchor not bad but just has this neat
emphasis that makes it appear a bit
strange this sounds more pleasant for my
ears or some nice place post at low
levels never sound steamed
yes almost
yes a bit louder
yeah but it sounds the either sounds
like the anchor with a little bit of
different EQ tuning maybe let's try some
dancers from nocopyrightsounds
I think the base of their ISIL is
slightly better slightly more boost
maybe but still no distortion I'll
increase volume slightly as well
let's check mixing volume as it seems
the Ankara was able to play a bit louder
and already lost from mixing this is
maximum laser eyes are laser whatever
rancor no no difference at all just at
the volume curve is a bit different
although who knows another trick there
is some very slight amount of distortion
with the bass drum but really
you
the anchor definitely it is louder
because of the much more stronger mid
response stronger or more boosted or
whatever I'm not sure it's really that
great because yeah the either just
sounds much more pleasant yeah if the
taotronics boom X sounds exactly the
same yeah go for it for $15 a great
speaker yeah not the loudest but also
very slight amount of distortion but
nothing really serious
of course these artifacts at low levels
yeah put me off a bit I hope the
taotronics doesn't have them
but who knows yeah this was a short
video about the Iser HS are 13 or
taotronics boom x if both really sound
the same but I'm sure they do
or very similar yeah please share your
opinion and your your experience you had
with the taotronics if it sounds the
same or equal or if you have the same
artifact at low levels play them it
during the first two or three volume
steps and you should hear some strange
growling groaning song sounds I don't
know yeah but who knows who really
produces all these because I don't think
it's taught Ronix it's not either
probably some no-name Chinese company
and then all the companies get there buy
them for ten dollars put their name on
it and sell them for 50 or 60 or even
more yeah so here we can see the PC free
eight at the back some food like the
like the post but it's not quite
removable mr. gray it's great build
quality much better than the anchor
which is all plastic so this looks
definitely more premium even being
cheaper but the only thing I'm really
not that proud of at the artifacts at
low level so let's hope that atronics
doesn't have them please tell me how
your unit performs yeah I hope this was
helpful to give you an idea also to show
you all the similarities between all of
these I can tell you that there are some
artifacts I cannot demonstrate you well
now well maybe I will try have a listen
to my metric and use
for the audio database the the first
bass drum is not rendered well here you
hear the housing book is from you should
be a punch but it does this strange
again OOP and the anchor does exactly
the same just like the jam heavy metal
and all the others now let's try the
anchor oh it did play well now again you
could hear this exactly the same book
song the HSI again you're here there is
also some strange kind of chorus effect
which often with jazz tracks with piano
tracks you can hear it well that the
piano sounds as if it was playing out of
tune all of them have the same problem
so probably just the internals are the
same and the whole or the body is
changed between the jam the letting the
anchor and and all of these so the same
speaker just tuned a bit differently and
yeah in reality all based on the Bose
Soundlink mini
they probably took some Chinese company
took the Bose Soundlink mini apart so
and then build it up from scratch with
their own yeah design and materials but
processing they caught they really tried
copying everything including processing
drivers basically it as it's all the
same it sounds even a bit better than
the boss but yeah if just a copy so why
not if you can have it for much cheaper
go for the copy I even prefer it because
I hear I pay 50 euros and for the balls
I have to pay 160 or an even 200 yeah I
hope it was helpful I hope you had some
fun and inside me and we will see us we
will see us I will see you will see me
in the next video with the PIO play a
six also with the dolly catch which I
have to finish my video um yeah until
then stay tuned and have a nice time bye
bye
