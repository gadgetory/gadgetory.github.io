ago I think it was 2011 I still remember
it as if it was been yesterday I was at
the ball store to try out their new book
sized portable Bluetooth speaker called
Bose Soundlink maybe some of you still
remember it so this was the first one
released 2011 and back then it was
regarded as decent I also liked it I
made a review claiming it to be the best
portable speaker because back then there
was not much there was the Logitech mm
100 mm 11 I don't even remember or the
Logitech has 750 I some Altec Lansing
but not really many that small managed
some really decent sound so it's some
kind of windage speaker and I would like
to compare it against a retro speaker
from today and the Marshall stockwell to
how the sound how the processing how the
overall perception of sound quality
changed during this time I would like to
play some samples as always using my pen
or microphones also my DJI Osmo action
as head cam you should of course listen
headphones is binaural recordings
require headphones for best results put
them up and let's check them out let's
start with the Bose Soundlink and the
track from so personam process which is
latest album
mahjongg is playing with different
settings now a liquid of course or Sonic
it's more to me like the boss boss again
such a smartie without any detail but
this was maybe the sound you will regard
as decent back then not which one I will
reverse phase to neutral again
and keep in mind we are listening
exactly on axis so when I moved out of
their sweet spot that most becomes like
this so even more ugly more Murphy
Murphy Murphy Murphy Murphy while the
stock whirlpool sounds still great
so yeah it was maybe great ten years ago
seeing that kind of bass coming out of
something in Hawke's eyes but yeah if
you compare it to some speaker from two
dates on just horrible let's try this
walk walk you can hear way more
controlled deeper bass not as booming
so way more open sounding yeah but this
was really guarded as decent the Molly
remember I think it's improved slightly
on sound when a volume was reduced here
and increased on the speaker to meet it
slightly better slightly more open
basilica here
some still way more open way more than
direct somehow yeah let's try this
and it's extremely direction as you can
hear so you would have to seal exactly
on axis with this here but it sounds
here Maxim kitchen radio although I was
also impressed this was eight nine years
ago but now you can hear it's not just
atrocious let's race
and pledged listener apexis against even
like this great the pose you can hear
sounds horrible
it's all free
let's um Jess maybe more acoustic him
any claim that Bowles sounds so great
with acoustic stuff so that's a listen
make this list like this
the marshal still sounds better and
listen from the side
feeds the room somehow in the sound
so became here the level has changed
quite a bit during the last year's this
was great some years ago while yeah
that's right this isn't the face here of
course increase again babies will make
it a little more droning but it will
never sound as the solidus from the hole
so much let's reduce base a little bit
second here the processing is so good
that it does not distort in any way by
the pose with this track still things
rolling impress people
yes I'm quite shocked how bad the pose
is nowadays although beg Danny again I
can listen like this from the side so
let's increase volume in a bit not sure
which one will play louder so this is
the boss at maximum
the marshal
some people compress maybe
so it makes me Marshall doesn't sound
that great
that's why this book doesn't sound s
process is best sounding 3d later on
there is louder with respect and really
depends the processing obviously here
doesn't have that not met many problems
again beause I lost it
so both heads nor less the same loudness
I think you would hear it it's quite
shocking what kind of horrible sound you
got for $300 back then this was the
original price and eight years ago this
was regarded as decent I also was quite
impressed by it
I made a German review on my blog
claiming it to be the best portable
speaker because back then there was
really not much so it was the first of
its kind later on with the successor
model the Soundlink - which had an
improved cover also sent volume control
the sounding 3ei was not really that
much of an improvement but when
listening to it today comparing it
against a recent speaker like the
marshall stockwell - yeah it's a night
and day difference so it's quite
shocking how far the portable speaker
market got both on the other hand yet
they released the sounding revolve glass
we already heard their before class
against the marshall so they didn't
really improve much on their sound on
their tuning rather Amada kind of sound
not really opened Bumi so I think the
marshall stockwell - shows what is
possible what could have been possible
already eight years ago maybe the stock
well one the first one sounds horrible
even worse than this so I am quite
impressed what they managed with the
stock well - here not perfect but really
way way better way more convincing than
the boss here but it's a classic I have
it from my neighbor when I still had
mine eight years ago I had a meeting we
did we need some barbecue together and
he was so impressed that he also bought
one he still has his I sold mine long
ago because yeah then the time times
have changed so you can get a better
sound out of the denim in via which is
way smaller than out of this here so I
hope I could yeah show you how much the
sound has improved on portable devices
compared I mean this was really great
eight years ago I was impressed I was
blown away what kind of base it managed
to create out of something that small
but if you listen to it now yeah it's
just atrocious horribly muddy kind of
booming sound so really really but this
is typical for both so the bose
soundlink evolved plus doesn't sound
really that much better just that it's
only rational but compared to the
Marshall it's also a disaster yeah I
hope you liked this little travel back
in time
with vintage versus retro and see you in
the next video bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
