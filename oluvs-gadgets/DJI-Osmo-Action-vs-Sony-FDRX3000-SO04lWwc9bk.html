that's awesome
- do say stop
like us post on Facebook
was the other hand rod
the other postal authorities the
sociopath
it's an the hardest part
I just rinsed
my vessel
the second a disc-shaped us party he
never got that English day thanks to the
Hoff
screaming and clamoring for the
sociopathy of hexanol tandem arrangement
Greenville knock knock Travis we know
palace for annoyed or not meet em Jimmy
entities if but senior foreign language
well
so some awesome
the seizure focus tension dramatist
so comes to the house hi everyone and
welcome I came here with my son we
wanted to make a scooter ride and I
wanted to use this time to compare my
new DJI Osmo pocket against my old sony
MDR
x3000 I have both mount into my head I
hope it remains quite stable yeah it's a
little clumsy but I hope it won't fall
down
usually I'm using the sony for all my
head mounted shots but i wanted to
improve on image quality for you also
simplify my editing i already made a
comparison of the sony against the gopro
hero black 5 i didn't post the video i
will do this afterwards as I thought it
might bore you but I simply want to
offer you the best possible image
quality therefore we want to make a
scooter ride I would like to see how
good the image stabilization of the DJI
really is the sony has an optical image
stabilization also a wider field of view
I don't apply any post-processing so no
lens correction simply will be shooting
both with 60 frames per second standard
settings so yeah let's grab the scooters
and let's go of course my son grabbed
the turbo scooter I have the mini
scooter about the air came on
I'm also wearing my Bonanno microphones
so we had in the audio quality is much
better like this compared to the to the
sound of the action cams this is the
sound of the Sony now and this is the
one from the DJI Osmo action and back to
my binaural microphones I think it's way
more realistic so we will do some two
kilometers maybe simply want to see how
they stabilize the image mr. peasley
alphas mob taken account furnace will
attract our assertion of funny
My Kitchen furnish my I'm talkin ta
that's cool
Oh
I hope the Sony won't hold on is it just
fixed with some sticky tape but I have
no way to connect to a mouse both at the
same time to my head and afterwards
please tell me which image you like more
which level is better
I will try split-- slain as split screen
and also sweating between one and the
other
nah forget the mix right about here
I'm not fine Shawn
it's a nice warm day later on we'll be
jumping into the pool which already
warmed up a little bit
minimap antenna is damaged to over
Southwest in Kouvola
we have the mini roller it seems we will
get some pimp or all√≠ viene
vengan important to volley c villa villa
gyro Impala remote italiano was it
accomplished in a temporary home for
italiano perky and Yvonne Cora Jean le
Lu Leo called tempo and Yama LM llamo
you only know what our infirmary
mangiare fritto misto gay pizza
spaghetti Yankee like what a delay
occurs italiani the city closest beach
ball yeah you got your party so yeah let
me know let me see the view angle what I
like about this on it is the remote
control which is of course pretty nice
very small
the DJI has to be controlled through
their phone or something also quite
unstable although I noticed that it's
better to switch Wi-Fi to 2.4 gigahertz
because 5 gigahertz is is not that
stable so it cuts off of one meter
what's open for is a little more stable
so both are shot with no exposure
exposure and correction and standard
colors or no sign design or something
just turned on and pressed record
I'm especially curious to see how well
they stabilize the movements on the head
when I'm when I'm probably sure in
despair this huh when I'm pushing myself
away
so far I was quite satisfied with this
only the only problem was that the view
angle is quite wide especially indoors
it makes everything way more disciplined
so when I have my speakers placed in
front of me it looks as if there were
two three meters away why in reality
just one and a half meters so I think
for this task the DJI should do a better
job but I also noticed that the
stabilization is although with action
shots it looked a little bit better
later on maybe I will try running it
doesn't seem to stabilize the micro
movements that well so when I'm moving
my head quickly it seems as if the sonic
was doing a better job here so but here
hashanah construed for a common
and yes system system to sister furnish
on each of the strap
so my mother paused I think this was
enough as a as a test
please Latino back come here mama could
supposed the only thing we could try
is maybe with me running a little bit to
see how they react so pepper and it's
Abby Sylvester last American they Stoke
understand the mush not put made me
ambition here funny huh not a Hindu max
so just to see which one gives better
with up-and-down movement also they are
not dead stable at my head it's already
quite quite heavy with both cameras
mounted I hope the Sun is still stable I
mean it just fixed with some sticky tape
you come out to be chanela so when he
becomes a bit older I would like to
start with running again like I did many
years ago I ran half marathon and how so
every second day about 10 15 kilometers
but this is long ago get your pizza for
dinner
so tell me which camera you like more I
think I will keep that DJ I was more
extra anyhow because it does a great job
and maybe I have to learn not to move my
head that much have a system with Viacom
so yeah sorry my video on some stay
Indians on Montana Rolla
Johanna been saying in the thule here
SOPA
it's starting to wobble around my head
already that Rama you can I read loose
of my head headband
yeah then keeps on snare him shut that
 down to two villains and rook
sucker alpha him yeah I'm just doing
this so that I get your opinion which
one is better what you like more but
with the Sami when I have to rectify the
image every time because I know many are
annoyed by this I do not need this with
the DJI Osmo action as it has lens
correction built-in so please tell me
your opinion I will also post my
comparison of the sony against the gopro
hero black 5 or whatever which i didn't
make it all the image quality was
somehow over processed with way too much
happening also some torn edges some
artifacts and noise artifacts so I think
the DJI is definitely better here but
still not quite sure if the sony or did
DJI therefore I would like to hear your
opinion would you like more for me the
easier workplace of course with the DJI
as I don't need to apply any post
processing with the Sonia usually I
would apply some sharpening which also
increases processing time and so on and
so on so I hope I didn't bore you too
much
check out my comparison with the GoPro
and the sony and then tenure opinion
which camera to choose for my future
test and I really want to offer you the
best image quality without you getting
somehow confused because of too much
moving many I have just to learn not to
move my head too much but so far I think
the DJI does a nice job so thanks for
joining
until the next video bye
I still understand a my husband is quit
mining
for our mouths rough isn't so severe
shot is this really common most violent
