to leave the Steelers no ACGT
as with all the wonderful snow currently
which can be with rare nowadays we have
so much fun riding the sleigh me and my
son that I thought would need something
faster and more professional
Stiga is a Swedish company they have
several models on the market is this the
Confederation I bought it from the
German Amazon store for 120 years and
the main feature of the king-size GT is
a longer seat also more stable build
quality and it should be suitable for
one child and one adult if it can carry
120 kilograms it comes in a large box
completely disassembled so you have to
assemble it first it takes a little bit
of time I need it around half an hour to
really tighten all the screws but you
can see the result is really nice yeah
the large seat it should really
accommodate a larger adult like me
together with my son we can see the
front ski which is a carving type so the
curves could be really taken fast I
think you can also see a front shock
absorber another thing it has a winder
so for pulling it you can yeah there is
no disturbing wire or something you have
a foot brake here which is nice but I
think it's still better to break
normally with with yeah with the shoes
what else to say yeah nothing that
special I think we will try it out
immediately
I will pick up my son from the
kindergarten and we will find a nice
long trace so we can test if it's really
better than our usual wooden sleigh so
yes let's check it out now you're on top
of the lead : Vienna which is around 830
meters above sea level the trace has
pretty nice snow conditions except the
lower part where obviously some snowplow
was driving around so I'm not sure we
will really get it to the very end but
we will try I'm having my Sony x3000
crouches also GPS so we can see thanks
to this how fast we are and the length
of the trace will be around three
kilometers maybe so yeah let's get
started
the him on th on e everyone attention
ah
so you get all the rest alone
nikoline link metrics and
understand that let me thank you
detective
they can't expand it
managed to it
thank you
here yeah you're right well but the 10
foot it was not that easy into we had
hardly any place for both feet here I
was not able to to use the brake so I
had to break with my sheet which on the
other hand got stuck here so I'm glad it
went fine much about the top speed we
will see with the GPS but it of course
more fun than a normal wouldn't play so
I'm glad we bought it and next time I
hope we will find a better place than
this the last part was impossible to
play because of the stones and
everything I hope you enjoyed it I hope
you will join next time until then have
a nice time and bye bye
Carroll
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
