you the most important question with
which is the best portable Bluetooth
speaker they don't I mean yeah I really
like it a lot to create speaker or the
JBL charge tool also great speaker just
look at Amazon on the reviews the calf
Muir pretty good speaker or the ballast
and Wilkins t7 what I gave it five stars
some other magazines gave it five stars
definitely one of the best speakers
according to them but I think the best
speaker is the Bose Soundlink mini look
at all the reviews there are thousands
of user reviews on Amazon also it's one
of the most sold portable speakers until
today so it must be simply great but now
I have here the new brand new rear is
and this is not just some Bose copy like
some others we have heard that on
music box for example or the anchor
premium speaker the gem heavy metal they
all use the same design with two drivers
to precipitate as Reba came up with
something completely new they have three
main drivers to add the sides one here
in the center and four passive radiators
so this thing has seven drivers inside
they use trillium processing to enhance
the stereo field and so on and I think
it's a really good sounding speaker
therefore I would like to compare it
against the number one until now that
Bose Soundlink mini maybe will also
check it against the highly regarded
Bowers Wilkins I bet they speak a little
bit and I was bashed because of this so
yeah as always I will be of course using
my binaural microphones if you listen
with high quality headphones you should
get a pretty realistic impression of how
these speakers sound but first we'll
concentrate on the river s and the Bose
so please put up your headphones and
let's have a listen so let's turn it on
and as you can see it has this near
sensitive area here when I come closer
with my hand the controls light up and
it should connect to my iPhone already
as I'm paired it takes
some time so it doesn't happen
immediately and there is a new app
called Riva audio and I can connect to
the speaker and there are some options
for example I already set it to silent
mode you can also enable voice prompt
tones but I prefer it completely silent
so yeah there are no tones and anything
and we can start playing some music
let's start with a kind of jazz track
and I can remotely control the speaker
from here and you also have the option
to turn on surround mode from here
this is some kind of delay between left
and right driver I don't know the exact
algorithm but you definitely hear some
some get eco or something with some
tracks so it works better I think for
movies and for also for classical music
I will turn it off again
it depends on the song sometimes it
sounds really great with other songs
it's not that good
but of course we would like to know how
it compares against the post
I will set them up like this so that the
drivers here can breathe a little bit
and I'll switch to the post known
this is much more precise I mean listen
to the symbols
also much more special the sound because
of the drivers that aim outwards I will
turn on sir on the game
it appears already a bit mushy all over
this song yeah it's not very critical
so you hear some slight room delay
effects so I will turn off surround
again and then let's try not afraid this
one is a bit more critical for
distortion we already heard it with they
come from music box yeah what you get
here is horrible
unusable
the river plays the screen without any
well any hint of problem
the kuntum was exactly as bad as the
pose maybe even worse
yeah it's simply horrible
let's try not okay this is a trick which
really makes many small speakers
struggle the bass together with the bass
drum let's listen how they both manages
here horrible
this is the best portable Bluetooth
speaker the bass is so impressive reverb
everything that I had yeah electric some
retro 70s porn music
I will stand up again it's this one's
okay from above
yeah this is night and day difference
another Peck again you already hear the
track becoming softer because of the
compressor
again something else so personal
together with Princess Frida
a nice 80s retro disco funk movie track
or something
but rather is completely missing the I
hope it's obvious that this is night and
day difference between these two
speakers the poster comes together like
this but cannot hold it in my hand the
whole time like this another soul
personification I will try increasing
volume to maximum
yeah that boss is louder but how him
hitting the result is is unusable
therefore the river doesn't compress
anything you have the whole dynamics
even at maximum volume while the boss
tries to keep the song loud but you've
heard it's horrible let's try it again
both at maximum
that's like this and it's pretty low
volume now let's try the pose
I mean
yeah
the post was not as loud anymore the
problem is they try keeping the level
always maximum but when you get this
punch some kicker yeah it struggles
while the river yes doesn't do anything
there is no dynamics processing if a
song is recorded soft it will remain
soft while the boss tries to make it
louder than here so it depends I mean is
this is not a bad speaker but compared
to the reverse it becomes a toy it's
it's you cannot take this serious the
result you get from this with many songs
I mean it's it's really struggling it
appears a bit more bass heavy maybe at
low levels but this is not it's just not
natural sounding the Riva is sounds like
like the original recording and I'm
really impressed with with the result so
far I have another highly rated speaker
I was bashed a lot because my review of
their Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins t7 was not really
positive so people criticized me for
having no clue about speakers and no
clue no idea about good sound yeah this
costs $100 more than the river it can
play quite a bit louder but the result
is also yeah unusable I thought we will
try a track yeah again some jazz track
and have a listen how both render the
same song I'm starting with the reverse
again
no the power solutions yeah this has
some FM radio or no it sounds like a low
bitrate and take mp3 or I don't know if
you tell me that this is good sound yeah
then I really have no clue about vocal
sounds this is no difference I mean this
is night and day even worse than with
the Bose six you never know becomes a
bit better on exes but how often can I
listen like this and it's simply with
one word horrible let's draw another
track against all persona
yeah this is a toy speaker I think China
sloth and salt pepper and let's listen
how how the sound changes when I move my
head so yeah as you can hear this is the
Riga s this is the power and Wilkins t7
I hope you liked this first sound check
and first impression I'm really
impressed
I mean it's not a very loud speaker
we've heard both appeared louder but
simply with unusable results you have
this this cover here the port color and
can use this like that so its water
proof water is resistant to some degree
a great speaker I mean one of the best
I've heard in this size and price range
this is look when I touch it what what
does I don't know but I was bashed
because I rated it badly
and I have no clue about speakers so
please buy the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins t 7 if
you really like good sound FM radio
sound thanks for watching guys I hope
you found this helpful in a bit and yeah
I will probably do much more checks with
the revised so stay tuned for more until
then have a nice time and bye bye
so for all these outro lavas let's try
David against Goliath
so which one is playing though I won't
tell you you choose the better one
yeah you tell me which is better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
