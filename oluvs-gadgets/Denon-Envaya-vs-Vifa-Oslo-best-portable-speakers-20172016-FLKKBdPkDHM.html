I would like to compare that best bottom
speaker from 2017 against the best one
from 2016 better in Vilas FIFA Oslo yeah
I know this is only my personal rating
still I think these are the very best
you can get within that class so not
really meant to be compared but when I
was looking at some frequency response
measurements of the denim I also checked
there FIFA Oslo you can see that then on
black and the FIFA with its neutral
joining in gray and they look quite
similar they're based on the FIFA which
is a little bit deeper but it also has
some deep around 200 300 Hertz that then
on seems to have more treble boost but
this product comes only from next audio
processing so according to the
measurement they should sound indeed
quite Cielo which would be surprising
given the size difference of course
loudness wise that they don't can't
compete I think it's best to listen by
ourselves in judge later on you can of
course also check them out through my
database compare that then on against a
Oslo with late night with neutral or any
other speaker but now let's compare them
directly as always I will use my burner
microphones also head cam you wrote of
course listen with headphones for the
most realistic result so please put them
on and let's have a listen the thief
also I said to its neutral mode is this
result in a flatter tuning and makes the
more comparable and the demo will be
playing first and is around two thirds
if you effect
the FIFA the Free File swing around half
now you can mental this is already quite
a lot of volume as you can hear from my
work so they are already drowning me
away here
something else
Infinity's they brought some speech here
b'fer
you can also hear that beep as somehow
more it there you know no one says a
thing wisely they go to sleep after so
much time you get more washed out still
quite impressive for this size
Christian
understand it is the shape that the
elephant is also here's some nice area
which remains more stable when you move
your head
something the different first
anything on its own either one or the
other it's really hard to choose over
here maybe a little bit more see
that I know something else and more
acoustic just song and you can hear and
really promote some stage you are having
here in front of you
if you fur
it simply onvo something great there is
hardly any stereo
so I mean for a normal user that Helen
is probably even overkill if many are
satisfied with a Huey boom or some other
UN's angle crap
but I'm really impressed what the small
demo achieves here
also here you can really hear the
positions of the musicians here
positions of the musicians although
maybe not as precise as their default
and here this in our channel air between
all the instruments tumble
and the denim melts them slightly
together but still I am remaining blown
away
still some awesome awesome acoustic so
here you should get some really nice
stereo with with with with
and overall very natural feeling so not
exaggerated in base travel or something
a fever
it's really as if you were sitting in
front of two speakers like now so one is
playing the left the other one the right
channel not a song also very proud
recording it to come here and in that
best distance is around one and a half
meters
you can hear nothing of this stellar
here maybe let's check the classic so
it's the song so listen how it manages
to play this kick here many speakers
including the creative algo were already
distorting the modus level but this of
course is still way more power so you
can really feel the woofer here these
are just two tiny drivers
so still very very controlled with
hardly any dynamic processing which is
quite impressive I mean here already a
little bit louder so if we reduce volume
to something like that
the differences will become merely even
lower somehow song let's leave it at
around half slightly below half you can
hear something that people has hardly
any advantage anymore
despite being s huge what probably needs
to set it to late nights now there's
something
because it's more smokiness from our
metal and hard rock lovers
maybe some been stripped
it's extreme that soundstage I'm having
here
a pulse way more signal because the
denim already struggles with these tiny
drivers like that the hospital has this
huge water inside Google first wanted to
fall on at the bed
the denim says you cannot compete here
anymore let's listen from angle you can
hear this kick is simply and I think it
tries really nicely it does a great job
game so let's check what happens at
higher levels maximum
a few fun
if this had been part of the puzzle
so of course it cannot compete anymore
let's try another crack
it still does a great job involved not
being extremely loud let's try to keep
our evolution step back again
alternation it comes naturally better
like this
as ice rattles with the base but we can
hear the addendum becomes ridiculous no
 loud from remedies deep
we can also reduce voting to get a clear
sound
I was try to match them again it is big
feza
working here the default part sounds -
OH
really great job I think you could hear
it as well I have from my pad I'm quite
impressed as the dinner is really not
that far off
of course the FIFA is still more precise
more detailed has more attack more
dynamic somehow but as long as you keep
volume at a reasonable level that none
can compete quite well here also with a
better stereo imaging the FIFA is rather
mono while you get some really nice on
stage if you sit directly in front of
the speaker
both are directional so they have a
sweet spot sitting directly in front but
I'm quite quite impressed how well the
Denon in this size can compete against a
much larger FIFA of course yeah it's
more than twice as loud also a little
bit more true maybe to the original
recording this movements out a little
bit all all the details but still very
very nice very detailed speaker at low
levels really nice so I think it
deserves the best speaker 2017 just like
that before also deserved it for 2016
it's still great but I think overall
winner for me is the Devon because of
the size and also price so for $200 yeah
a winner yeah I hope this could give you
an idea also a better understanding
about the Denon and I it's not perfect
because of some slight
backs and flaws here with volume control
but overall the sound is simply amazing
so on a similar level as the FIFA was
low of course not meant to be cranked to
100 DB or something still the sound is
kept always at a really high level
without any artificial I don't know
compression and so on just some slight
limiting so when it gets when when some
stronger parts come in you can hear some
slight volume reduction if you crank it
to higher levels but apart from that
it's it remains really very faithful to
the original recording which I'm really
impressed by with whatever so thanks all
for watching and see you in the next
video have a nice
bye-bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
