going to have a look at another
low-budget speaker this is the soundbot
SB 525 currently it goes on Amazon for
only $35 so pretty cheap and just seven
dollars more expensive than this one's
angled 3 crap we just heard recently
someone suggested to me that I should
try it out I had a look and I think it
looks really promising also interesting
just like like some JBL charge to
knockoff but a really blatant one you
can see the same Pasiphae it has the
same design same layout so it could be
of course interesting to hear how this
cheap copy sounds compared to the
original
but unfortunately the speaker is only
available in the US so thanks to my
viewer to my trusty viewer Sandra she
sent this to me together with this owns
angle 3 so that we can check it out and
yes see if it's really worth it yeah
before having a listen maybe let's check
out some frequency response measurement
and first I thought it would probably
measure like some JBL charge too well
but in reality it doesn't so here you
can see the soundbot and yeah a rather
natural except this high treble peak at
9 kilo Hertz if we overlay the JBL
charge tool here you can see that it
measures and also sounds completely
different but then I thought it reminds
me some of the charge 3 so when we
overlay the charge 3 here in gray you
can see that yeah they are both pretty
similar just the treble is quite
different on the charge - it has the
peak slightly higher and doesn't roll
off as deep with treble therefore maybe
the soundbot has this 9 kilohertz peak
to mask some treble and miss some
missing treble above 10 kilohertz and
when looking at some lower volume steps
you can see that the soundbot even has
slightly more bass but at high levels it
reduces bass more than the charge 3 and
it also cannot play as loud at maximum
it distorts quite a bit so it's rather
comparable to the loudness of a charge -
but with the base of the charge 3
therefore yeah it's of course
interesting to check out how it sounds
as always I'm using binaural microphones
so please listen to that phone
I will turn it on and yeah let's check
it compare against the JBL charge 3
which costs quite a bit more I will
start with the soundbot and yeah let's
have a listen charge 3 you can get it
both half at tribal problem
but in this case the sample you maybe
sounds slightly more convincing both
don't solve some debt right with treble
but of course it depends on the kind of
recording also kind of music let's try
maybe some jazzy funk track the charge
tree has slightly similar treble but
gives a similar muffled impression as
the sound body
but you can hear that their base is
pretty similar low just like seen from
the measurement something else it's a
really very powerful sound just like the
charge sweep for $35 on me this sounds a
little bit clearer here track from
Quebec and here you will notice that the
charge free starts to sound a bit more
powerful with base charge beam
yeah overall quite a bit more refined
but still for $35 if you have based lava
this is pretty impressive
of course with this is from soul persona
together princess feature so final
recordings let's save the difference in
travel will be will become more obvious
sounds really muffled is their trash
free is definitely much better here or
some smooth chest wreck
yeah you can reach this resonant peak is
quite noticeable here
patrasche for you it sounds definitely
better I mean it's also much more
expensive but you know we could maybe
correct some of the sound here
as always I'm using this is equal ten
for example by the way sorry and we will
use a track from Seoul / Frieza this is
without EQ now I prepared a preset which
reduces to entered slightly reduces that
peak at 9 kilo Hertz and boosts upper
treble a lot is a part that is
completely missing this is a track I'm
also using on my database and you will
hear how it sounds with some EQ
adjustment and some play it sounds more
comparable to a charge tool
so reducing peak and boosting up a
treadle slightly helps definitely a lot
again without this is the sound you'll
get yeah
it's a pity they could have definitely
tuned it much better but let's get back
to our comparison against the charge 3
maybe some rock track and it doesn't
sound bad but it could have definitely
be much better than it is now yeah this
has a much finer Sun somehow
maybe some dance tracks
because maybe try reducing volume on
both okay finished off track so far she
finished so yeah sorry for the short
break but my camera didn't have any
charge left in simply turned off but
where did we stop at low level so let's
start again with the soundbot
the charge tree sounds a bit clearer but
also thinner
let's put them far away and turn to
maximum to see the difference in
loudness it also have to be careful here
they didn't even change the base of the
charge tool so they didn't redesign it I
will turn the sound back to maximum we
are not very loud the charge free as
well
not right in the meantime we can replace
sorry for that the lightning change the
charge stream yet is this maximum I mean
there is difference in loudness but not
better each day its deputy there what
it's still quite okay loudness wise
although not very clean sounding anymore
with charge three again
so now the slicer comes what chemical
complete it's more comparable to the
charge - maybe let's try this
screen difference is creepy others
but what we could also tries maybe
comparing the soundbot against the the
angle there oontz angle 3 let's turn
this on
also check out sound quality and
loudness of what this is really loud but
still loud doesn't automatically mean
great sorry this was that bluetooth
button here is the power button they
even put in some sticker so that you
find it and yeah let's see if it's
connected it is and I will start with
the ones not with the sound pop it is
not maximum now but
now their homes I mean this is
ridiculous
and we'll turn it up again a little bit
maybe this sounds really harsh therefore
the Sun box appears even more muffled
knowledge I will turn both the maximum
there's some purpose oil
there is this pretty great difference in
loudness this is the song but no still I
think at maximum the ends gets a little
bit more advanced punch avoid also the
poor quality so yeah
loudness wise the ones angle is hard to
beat in this price range maybe even one
of the loudest speaker speakers in for
around twenty thirty dollars I'll put
them again a bit closer
first I have to reduce volume on the
insane otherwise it will play at maximum
and yeah maybe some other track from
savasana but you can hear at normal
listening levels they simply sucks big
time the soundbot / bit muffled sounds
much better
it's also hard to match volume football
face this one has much more bass while
the other one what I think for yeah
seven dollars more if you like bass I
mean this has real bass so I think it's
worth worth more than this anchor sound
Co all in Cassandra the ohms
no.3 I'm getting a bit confused still
it's a bit of a pity that they didn't
really make it as great as it could have
been also they just copied the charge
two or three design but they didn't try
to improve it with maybe even drivers at
the back so you get a more only
directional sound slightly better tuning
this base or foot here is the same as it
was on the charge too so it tends to
roll away especially if you put it on
some some some soft surface it doesn't
really stand stable they put even the
same here so they can also place it
vertically I mean it's a nice speaker
for $35 but it could have been
definitely much better you will see this
better indicator here you have to press
the battery button now it lost one dot
strange
you can skip between tracks with I think
let's try you have to keep button
pressed for volume change
and less Watley for ya
so it has everything you need including
hands-free and so on but sound wise it's
not perfect you read it it's great bass
performer very similar to the charge
tree although it doesn't have the same
power judge we can play much louder this
reduces bass earlier and also cannot
play as loud and distorts quite a bit at
maximum of course it's already within
the database together with the un's
angle 3 you can compare them both I
think this is for just seven dollars
more if you like bass it's much better
although not as loud but you will hear
this
Anil is one of the thinnest sounding
within the database even the smallest
ones like the own maker and so on
somehow have more punch than this so not
quite sure what they attuned here I mean
this is neither treble is great nor
anything so I hope this could give you
an idea about the soundbot SB 525 I was
really curious to hear it as I thought
it would be more a JB a charge to copy
but in reality it's rather a charge 3
copy with charge to design it's not
perfect and could have been definitely
better but still quite nice for $35 if
you like bass you will probably like
this on but also with some EQ adjustment
if you have some great EQ app or even
some Android device with with rooted
device that you have a global EQ you can
definitely improve the sound a lot by
simply pulling down 200 slightly as the
200 Hertz boost is a bit too big too
huge and take down this 9 kilohertz peak
and add up or treble as much as possible
as it's completely lacking upper travel
therefore yeah so I hope you liked it I
hope it was helpful thanks all for
watching and see you in the next video
have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
