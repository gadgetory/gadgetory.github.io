compare the new JBL paddy box against
them not so new anymore sony TK xfinity
that we already heard last year I think
in the meantime it's even discontinued
because it's not that easy to find but
let's be honest the GPL is indeed quite
a blatant copy of the Sony with this
useless light effects also the three
tweeter design so the speaker changes
the sound depending on the position just
like the Sony I think the JBL was caught
by surprise with the success of the
speaker series here although I don't
quite understand why because they sound
just horrible how can they become
successful the exponential because it's
really loud nearly as long as the sound
box goes I have shown in the video but
the XP sixth is just horrid so let's see
what JBL made out of this format factor
I will play some tunes so we can
hopefully hear a difference as always I
will be using my veneral microphones
also head came to give you this first
person kind of impression and sound you
should of course listen with headphones
put them up and let's have a listen
let's start with some funky jazz by
Facebook operation Simon Gray's life
event and the party box being first
slightly above half
Hasani is playing with its default
settings which is the m eq and extra
resonance is night and day
way more definition for the GDL
try boosting base to make it with this
often leave it off because doesn't make
sense like we do I need to make brains
blasts like they have a dose of crack
barrel every check so they have a rap
protect and now Ram
I think that they should follow his on
the Sonia we have to increase it on a
speaker because otherwise the processing
is not right so and I set about half one
notch of emojis about part
so he taught me this is just some mop
you can hear there's no base as some
upper base boost
it's awful mixing
toriel toriel
here also control plus simple way to
pull me the base is on both here way
mortified
great gift
this will again have to increase it
directly on the speaker you see lots of
headroom so I think it will be much
louder now the Sony
- Oh pepper here
jazzy boys
sorry
bada-bing maybe twenty meters away no he
sounds better but not that long
that is maybe six and did you difference
between historic metal
there's some nice lower baseball
it's not listen
thanks to UW Health at the base from
yeah
modeling is quite a lot recording
the district much louder ever to do
laughs trick
I introduced volume to a similar level
as the GBA displaying at maximum rather
than this
much better pay
any instrument just
at least the Sony can be misused as a
seat no just kidding but it sounds like
a booming kitchen Raider to me some toys
they are not even comparable although at
the same time it's really loud so much
louder than the JBL maybe twice as loud
and this is the biggest problem of the
JBL it's not a very loud speaker so this
size would definitely suggest more power
they have this bass boost function which
cuts off lower bass boost up a bass at
the same time they could have made it
louder
yeah not true what the reason is still
it sounds great
much better than a sony simply likes
loudness so I hope this yeah
could give you an idea about these two
sound waves not really comparable the
JBL even sounds nice at home at normal
levels my this one is completely
unusable you got here you just started
to get a life it makes me own but then
you get this heavy knocking so it's not
a real bass just some knocking on wood
pop why don't you build sounds nice
controlled also quite balanced we have
this bass boost forget this I hope they
will hear released some updates to
correct this because right now it's not
just horrible they could boost more than
area in the 70 80 Hertz region to yet to
make the sound little bit fuller cut
lower base at the same time make it
louder then it would make sense but like
this it just yeah unusable so yeah I
hope you liked this video I hope this
could give you an idea about this tool
also compelling from my database where I
recorded them at home at normal levels
then you should hear the difference is
quite well yeah and see you in the next
video I will of course also do an SPL
measurement for the JBL I thought it
will reach hundred five hundred six
because it's quite soft party a great
sounding maybe it depends what you want
if you like loudness noise then go for
the Sony if you really are after great
sound quality then definitely the GB oh
yeah thanks for watching and see you the
next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
