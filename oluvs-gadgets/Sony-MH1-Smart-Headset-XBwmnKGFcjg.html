present you another quite underrated
older in ephraim sony sony ericsson i
think over the time there were different
names for it but this is the one I got
it's called Sony smart headset or Sony
MH one I think there's also an image one
see I'm not quite sure what the
difference is up but I got this from
Amazon for I think 16 euros I also saw
it from an Austrian dealer in Vienna who
offers it below 8 with bulk packaging I
will drive the later on to pick three
other ones because I like it so much
this was again recommended to me by John
after the a thematic mk5 the samsung s8
bundle this is the third one and yeah
just like me John seems to have a fable
for as natural as possible sound and I
think this is as close to this as it can
be with a one single dynamic driver so
it's a simple one dynamic driver in here
but really tuned better than many others
which have five drivers like this case
ed a s10 is really impressive maybe the
best work from Sony unfortunately you
can see the wire should be untangled
free or tangle free but it's very stiff
you always feel it here at your face
also the remote control does not work
with iPhones and Android devices
if you press some button you just hear
the sound cut off hence yeah it it's a
little bit disturbing here comes with
different tips to coloured ones in a
nice pipe like this so you get green
ones black ones in two different three
four different sizes really nice and
yeah the most impressive part is of
course the sound before maybe looking at
some measurements I will let you listen
and let's compare it against this
Samsung s8 bundle for all those who
complained that the Samsung is to travel
heavy to base heavy yeah this is it
because it brings the same natural
tuning to a more neutral level so with
less bass with a more natural trouble
especially Trevor is so smooth but keep
in mind the recording I do here with
with with this ear system is not hundred
percent representative and trying my
best to bring it as close to reality or
to this what I'm hearing but it's quite
impossible with this setup I'm not that
satisfied so it doesn't sound
as smooth as in reality but I think the
general characteristics is captured
quite well
so now let's listen to the Sony MH one
compared to the Samsung earphones to buy
EKG and later on we'll discuss
I'm not quite sure if the differences
were really dead obvious but maybe you
could hear that the sony has a more
athletic tuning it sounds really as
close to an indian monitor with really
natural sound maybe let's look at the
measurements here keep in mind this is
compensated for the diffuse field target
so treble appears way more boosted here
when looking at the uncompensated draw
response you get this free kilohertz
peak which is just an eerie resonance
but maybe it's not that easy to read and
compare measurements like this I will
overlay the Samsung s8 bundle here yeah
and you can see the general curve is
quite similar the Samsung has more bass
or some more treble here above 8
kilohertz the Sony is overall smoother
so I must confess and extremely
impressed with it it plays on a much
higher level than the price would
suggest what the design I heard in is
that cost her at 5,200 dollars that
sound worse than this so for eight euros
yes this is a no-brainer
I mean it's maybe not to everyone taste
because it's really neutral so as close
as possible to an in-ear studio monitor
bass sounds really really great if you
like this more neutral sound
representation I mean there are people
who like or prefer sound which is off
they listen to really strange sounding
in ears or headphones so this is maybe
not for you but for all those who like
this flat neutral studio sound based on
amazing and especially is definitely
treble clearly so smooth I've never
heard such a smooth treble from other in
years there's no harshness no sibilance
I heard in is with balanced armature
drivers with five drivers in sight which
sounds horrible compared to this I will
redo this case at a s10
just no comparison so thanks again John
for this recommendation here it's a gem
it's a it's a hidden treasure this in
here there was some hype around it I
think some years ago there were also
some measurements showing that it's a
bass anyone I find it rather flat
sounding with pace of course with the
measurement the row on you can see there
is some bass boost but yeah the Hammond
responds target has some slight baseball
so I think compensated for Hammond
response or for Hammond target it would
again appear flat
yeah nothing else to say about this I
will use it for my future reference
comparisons because it sounds so great
still I'm not sure if everyone would
like it there is maybe some slight
hollow some slight hollowness to the
sound I have another one coming video
which corrects this hollowness but
doesn't have this smooth travel that
probably is really outstanding
I'm so impressed maybe you will notice
if you press it inside there is some
change in sound but as soon if you leave
it untouched it's nice and yeah there is
some crackling it's like from this cheap
there is no air vent nothing but yeah I
don't care for this price yeah and no
brainer so I hope this was helpful check
out the so nice Matt had said if you
still can get one I doubt there will be
many cheap let's say up to hundred
dollars which can compete with this here
sunrise if you are after a neutral
natural sound representation of course
if you like heavy British post I don't
know with strange-sounding trailer then
yeah there are maybe better cheaper ones
but this for a hit euro seats i mean i
don't know it's ridiculous let's say so
I hope this was a little bit helpful
another suggestion from from John will
be coming yeah I respect his on pick a
pinion a lot I got again many
recommendations for strange in years
from I don't know me and I am not quite
sure that they really can compete with
with the natural in the how do you say
natural natural relative of sound
representation of this year's of the
upcoming ones maybe they are more baby
but who cares I mean if I want more base
I will increase base I prefer rather a
really natural tuning again like the
artist recorded in the studio I mean
they are not recording on some heavy
boom boxes but have studio monitors on
in front of them so if a hip-hop ax or
some rap guy
is more based into his mixes yeah he
still distance flow studio monitors and
not for some boombox so if you listen
for a bass boosted boombox you will get
the whole the bass which is completely
yeah strange approach so I prefer to
listen to music yeah how the artist
intended to be listened to
and I like the Sony's it could be
definitely better but not for this price
and could pretty sure you will look at
in years which cost to 300 or even more
dollars yeah some other some other
recommendations from John are coming up
again thanks John
I respect his opinion so much he really
he's deep into this and he knows his
stuff so sorry if I don't follow our
recommendations but so far the only one
who I really trust hundred-percent
is John so if he says this one is good I
will buy it immediately why would the
other ones I'm not quite sure
so thanks out for watching and see you
in an upcoming video and a nice tyrant
