the three big excretion this is a
wireless bluetooth headphone which I can
get on Amazon for $50
so quite affordable although actually
not that bad also we're looking at the
customer you see on Amazon 550 of them
most of them are five stars and I really
think it's quite okay especially for
this price but first let's have a look
at the packaging comes in this typical
orange tribute packaging inside is a
carrying pouch and to make it fit inside
you can fold it so you can see it
becomes quite small for transport fits
in nicely here inside is also a micro
USB wire for charging a 3.5 millimeter
one so you can also use it passively if
you get out of charge simply attach the
wire and please like this the headphone
itself is quite comfortable very soft
fashions it doesn't have any active
noise cancellation but isolates quite
nicely it's an a closed back design and
I think the sound is quite ok but it
could be definitely improved what I
noticed is that the sound is small is
the same regardless if played over
Bluetooth or wired and then I thought
obviously they don't use any active
equalization so no parametric equalizers
and I asked if there is some potential
tooth unit they said yes we didn't use
the parametric equalizers so I hadn't
listened and tried to improve the sound
slightly make it more reasonable I
didn't want to change the tuning
completely it's quite a bass heavy
headphone but there is too much upper
base so I tried to flatten the sound
slightly but still keeping the
characteristics of it just make it a
little bit more reasonable and yeah this
was my suggestions sorry
figure this were my suggestion for the
parametric equalizer
I used equalizer a puff of this with
five parametric equalizers and below you
can see the resulting curve so maybe
let's have a listen before and after my
tuning you can also check it out from my
database of course with its original
tuning compare it against any other
headphone but now I will play analog
from so Poisson process freedom first
you can hear the original track then how
it sounds original and then after my
tuning so let's have a listen
I think I managed to make it sound a
little bit smoother still without
changing the overall characteristics too
much but get rid of this upper base boo
- also treble has some graininess to it
maybe let's have a look at some
measurements to see what's going on here
this is the original stock tuning for
left and right and you can see there is
some left/right imbalance which could be
also due to different placement for left
and right but I think this is simply the
price you have to pay for a cheap
headphone I mean there are also
expensive ones way more expensive ones
that have left-right imbalance there I
think it's not that severe
I will average left and right which
results in this curve and you can see
there is simply way too much base
especially in the area of 100 150 Hertz
I overlaid the measurement after my
tuning so what did I do
you can see I didn't touch the lower
base but try to reduce the base in the
area of 150 200 Hertz at the same time I
boosted lower meets at 4 500 Hertz then
reduce the to 3 kilohertz region and
also reduced 6 7 8 kilohertz
this graininess of travel you usually
get at around 10 key notes if you have
some 10 kilohertz boost the travel
becomes simply way too harsh
but I didn't touch the upper treble here
as you can see so I just reduced the mid
or lower treble and I think it sounds a
little bit nicer I sent them my
suggestion and some weeks later I got a
new unit obviously it cannot be updated
through USB or by myself that's why I
got a new unit and yeah I think they did
a great job they did more than I did and
I would like to let you listen again
again playing analogue from so person
from this region so first we will hear
mmm the original tribute extra tune with
my EQ tuning and then the new unit with
already there
tuning applied and later on we'll
compare the original
extra tune with the new unit which which
was returned by them so let's listen
again
I think you'd hear they did quite a bit
on job they didn't simply apply my EQ
but try to smooth from the South even
further and I think the result is quite
okay although for my taste they reduced
travel too much it lost some of the
sparkle is also upper treble was reduced
you could also hear the imaging shifted
or changed a little bit compared to the
original model that I have also maybe
sample variation and left/right
imbalance so let's have a look at the
results after that Union and you can see
for left and right there is again some
imbalance especially in the treble area
around 10 kilohertz
I will average both channels and let's
compare it to my suggested tuning as you
can see they reduced lower base
flattened this deep at 300 Hertz and
reduced travel over all a bit too much
especially upper treble so for my taste
I think it sounds really great much
better than before I am not quite sure
about this load bass reduction but I
don't miss it but I miss some trebles
pattern they reduced travel too much and
I was not sure if it's just because of
sample variation because left and right
was quite different here so I didn't
give them any final feedback I wanted to
have another look at it but didn't have
much time and then they told me yeah we
already released so many with the
original tuning that we cannot release a
new one which is a pity because I think
it sounds really great with with this
new tuning and I'm trying to suggest
them again to have another look maybe
release an updated version version 2 or
whatever or tuned by I'm not sure I know
but some special edition because I think
this headphone has some potential with
its stock tuning it sounds too rough for
me simply too much upper base
but it can be returned and brought to
some really nice response so I thought
we'll have an another listen with
comparing the original that you get on
the market and this unique unit which I
will give away to one of you with my
usual tricks and yeah at the end you can
give me some feedback because I think
yeah maybe when there are enough votes
we could try forcing tribute to release
a new version maybe with five to ten
dollars more it's probably some work to
implement it into new units maybe some
height we design some other color or
whatever but I'm sure tell me if you
like the new tuning and they could maybe
release it with this with this new sound
so let's all listen again original
tribute ex return against the new let's
call it prototype because there is just
the sing unit that they sent to me but I
think they could release a new version
with this so literally
is it just a team of a man-size my
fantasy to me you are in my thoughts I
never stray from the heart of you
am i touching you I wanna feel every
part of these
yeah there is definitely some difference
in imaging but I think this is just
simple variation another unit with this
tuning will sound again slightly
different for this price you cannot have
absolute quality control but I got
headphones costing three four hundred
dollars which also have sample or left
and right imbalance so I mean this is
what you have to pay for a cheap
headphone like this yeah but tell me
which tuning do you like more I think
with this new tuning especially I like
they did because they smooth in this
area around 300 Hertz even more I think
it sounds really great just missing some
upper treble sparking this unit will go
to one of you sorry I didn't manage the
roughly yet but I will do during the
next days and then I hope someone will
have fun with it is I really enjoyed a
lot just missing some some some
refinement with treble already quite
nice it would need maybe some slight
boost above 12 kilo Hertz by 4 5 DB I'm
not quite sure but maybe they could
manage so tell me your opinion I will
write to trivet if they are really
willing to release it as a new version
with the retune sound improved and then
we can maybe put in more time Toto find
unit because there was not enough time I
had it at least I was not as satisfied
because of this lacking treble so I
didn't give them my feedback immediately
and then they told they told me yeah
unfortunately it's already too late
because there are so many on the market
that we cannot suddenly release a new
version yeah I hope this was helpful to
give you an idea about the tribute extra
tune check it out through my database
compared against some other wireless
speakers like that IVA och one or the
know the nura phone which sounds really
horrible so for $50 this is quite okay
but I think it could be brought to even
a higher level and I try to show you
with this video so thanks a lot for
watching and see you next year
bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
