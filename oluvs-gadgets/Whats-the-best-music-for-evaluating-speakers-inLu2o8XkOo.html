talk about quite an important topic for
many yeah also for myself what type what
kind of music is best for testing
speakers I get comments repeatedly like
yeah why don't use any classical music
or you can only hear the qualities of a
speaker with acoustic music with natural
instruments or with vocals you only play
electronic music or I don't know well
this seems to be a topic which bother
some so some one of my viewers who also
views other channels asked an expert
from PS audio yeah let's have a look at
this video the best for evaluating
speakers this question comes from Gary
in Honolulu Hawaii Hawaii hi Paul
what are the best types of music to test
speakers headphones or an audio system I
was always under the impression that
acoustic unamplified music was the best
I've just read an opinion by an
Australian and Oh an Austrian youtuber
named Olaf who does reviews on Bluetooth
speakers and recently in ear earphones
on his channel called clavinet junkie
okay he states the following in response
to a viewer criticizing his use of
electronic dance music and his tests ah
and this is where you are mistaken
together with many other wannabe audio
files best for comparing differences
between speakers or headphones would be
pink noise this reveals immediately
where the flaws and frequency response
are the second is pop or rock Wow
I'm not sure oh love my fellow youtuber
and I agree yeah I'm quite flattered
that other youtubers especially real
audiophile experts like pop from peers
audio are talking about me but I cannot
quite confirm with this opinion I mean
he was so kind to not start any flame
war to stay with the topic to give us
his points but I don't think I agree
with everything many audio files forget
some really important aspects of spirit
testing and I mean
Paul seems to be some real audio
engineer but he's already a little bit
older maybe about 60 years old so he
probably won't even hear above 10
kilohertz or let alone fifteen point
seven hundred fifty Hertz which is the
typical frequency that they CRT monitor
creates you can often hear this tone as
a background artifact in many modern
recordings the audio engineer didn't
hear it I think my hearing is still good
enough over I'm 45 years old I can
easily hear these frequencies you can
hear this on George Michaels patients
always in the background some some
high-pitched tone like this here so I'm
not sure many of you hear this
I heard easily 20,000 Hertz not anymore
but I can still hear this tone so Paul
has maybe is maybe competent but maybe
his hearing is not that great and saying
that acoustic music is best for testing
is also wrong many forget about audios
circle of confusion what is this
the problem is that there is no
reference to a of recording music so
every recording will sound different as
an example take some vocals some
instrument is recorded by some
microphone then processed also the
frequency of the microphone is not
always flat so processed by an engineer
heard over monitors studio monitors
which are again tuned by another one who
was hearing recordings which were again
recorded by some microphone do you see
it's and it's not a reference circle so
every recording depending on how you
place your monitors how your studio is
equipped how good your ears are again
back to the topic that many other
engineers simply don't hear well above
15 kilohertz
Bruce Sweden the recording engineer from
Quincy Jones who recorded the best
albums he was maybe 60 when he did
thriller or maybe 55 so his hearing was
already not that great but still the
recordings are works of art but when
looking at them today they stopped
simply thin so you cannot judge the
sound of a speaker by listening to a
great recording by Quincy Jones or
Michael Jackson because it sounds free
not to modern recordings
every recording for example take a
bright recording it will sound maybe
okay on a dual speaker but on a neutral
one it will appear way too bright also
how you place them in a room if you have
a room which has lots of dampening it
was some different and there is no no
real norm for this how to record every
studio despite having the same exactly
the same student monitor will sound
different because of the room because of
the ingenious ability because of it a is
taste so if you hear the vocal of some
no 9 9 Simone Nina Simone and you think
it sounds likelihood of a nice speaker
you never heard her in front of you so
she was recorded in some recording booth
with some particular microphone then to
bring out her voice the engineer in ya
process this may be boosted some
frequencies if I change the equalizer
for my voice like now here to make it
more bass heavy you can still recognize
my voice but it sounds different what if
I make it brighter you can still
recognize its name but it's brighter now
so you don't know how the engineer
recorded this vocal still many yeah her
vocals sounds perfect uncoloured for my
speaker how do you know how she sounds
in reality I mean where she is standing
in front of you so if you are listening
to the recording of her voice inside
your room you have so many parameters
that you will never hear how she sounds
in reality it will not sound as she was
standing in your room here but rather
where she was standing in the studio
together with your room acoustics and my
goal is not to play music because you
like it or don't like it you like I
don't know they are straight so you
would expect data straight but I select
tracks which reveal the differences of a
speaker there is some also like the
circle of confusion Harman research had
has lots of topics what kind of music
you should use for speaker tasting and
the worst was a jazz trio acoustic just
where it might sound nice over a speaker
and it might sound great but it won't
reveal any
differences of speakers this is what I'm
trying to offer you I always show you
two speakers and to demonstrate you the
difference I need a high bandwidth
signal with lots of frequencies
containing not only vocals
although vocals are complex like my
voice you can distinguish it from an
otherwise because of the four months I
have individual kind of formats but I
can still reduce frequencies and you
will recognize my voice like I
demonstrated before so in my case pink
noise would indeed be the best signal to
immediately show you the difference
between one speaker and the other if you
have one which is reference and you
compare them to the other by simply
playing peak noise not music you will
immediately hear that there is some
difference if I for example played some
vocal track over one speaker and another
one which sounds somehow off it may
sound still the same but if you play
pink noise or some really dense dense
music rock heavy metal which is some
kind of modulated pink noise you will
immediately hear which speakers sounds
okay which is the reference and which
stands off so this is not a topic and
not playing music because I want to play
I want to play nice music but I select
metrics which are revealing therefore I
like to use so persona many have some
problems with it because it's artificial
instruments and so on no I don't care
every recording is artificial to some
degree because of the audio circle of
confusion you will never be you will
never know how it was recorded how it
was processed how your room influences
this even with with a chain that is
completely
I don't know yeah normalized but there
is no such chain you just check some
recordings from the 80s up to the 90s
they were rather thin while modern
recordings are really fed not only
because of loudness war
that's simply probably also because of
loudness war but if you for example
compare again Michael Jackson Thriller
the original recording against them
remastered one you will hear that the
remastered one is way louder but also
better somehow it's still far not as
thick as modern recordings but it's
definitely different
so there is simply no absolute I don't
know music which would say this is how
it should sound or whatever I try to use
tracks which are all also somehow
dynamic with lots of attacks so you can
immediately hear which because Travis
with this with classical music you won't
hear this and therefore I would like to
demonstrate this with some examples so I
selected some speakers which somehow
sound similar somehow different and will
hopefully here yeah they're the material
the music that is played how it
influences your perception of sound and
if you can distinguish them better so I
won't say that
acoustic music or vocals or classical
music let alone okay that doesn't have
any real attacks for that to really make
the speaker suffer you need some really
heavy electronica stuff with bass drums
kicks drums with some square waves which
are not present in the nature you won't
get any instrument that that creates a
perfect square wave imagine the the
membrane the driver for a square wave it
has to move like this very very quick
not smooth like with a violin which also
with an whole Orchestra which is rather
mushy kind of sound but he you have two
distinct positions very a hundred
percent to the front another percent to
the left and if a speaker cannot do this
you will immediately hear that it
creates some distortion some some
farting or whatever so let's start me
with the first example here I have the
nine bass which many people seem to like
yeah I think it sounds way off mmm
although in the meantime we can get it
for $50 or something so it's okay for
this kind for this money but it's still
not a great speaker and here I have the
title boom strap you can see compared in
size which is not flat either but it has
quite a balanced sound a slightly mmm
yes madam responds but no Peaks or no no
frequencies that are and first I would
like to play a vocal track so an a
cappella version of soul persona and
princess and project I have no other
trade which are copyright free so I have
to use this and later on I will play the
same track well let's let's listen to
the vocal track first they're driving
they're they're writing it on the wall
subjective they're gambling the rambling
regulations for the nation that that's
true but which one's looking straight up
I can fake up where's the proof q back
to the anchor see the bankers and I'm
real he's on our think tank girls got
the red girls thank the so could
you hear any distinct difference is on
the solo volkov between the nine bass
and the toy foot boom Stern yeah they
sounded still Maul is the same so let's
try the same track but as a full
arrangement now and then you will
hopefully hear it better
I think now you could immediately hear
it that the nine base has some trail
problem I can show you some frequency
response measurement from both you have
you can see the nine base this is the
one with this heavy peak here in the
treble so it sounds just horrible and I
cannot quite understand why people like
this the treble had this strange
metallic character but it was not easy
to to hear this out from the solo vocal
you needed the whole arrangement then
you could also hear the differences with
bass still quite similar both betrayal
is definitely the problem on the 99 bass
apart from treble the response is small
s flat but yet treble sounds just
horrible and I would like to show you
another example with classical music
here I have the driver from 20 Bose
because around $50 and the tribe it
makes on + both have a quite natural
flat response and we will play a
classical track first so it will
hopefully hear which one renders it more
realistic but again how do you know how
this orchestra sounds in real life
because it was again recorded through
some microphone in some room which
already affects the sound yeah but let's
have a listen to the album first and the
tribute afterwards
so I think it's really not that easy to
say which one rendered it moralistically
but now let's try some electronica track
which so many hate because it's not
natural make this classical track and
then you will hopefully hear which one
struggles more
so I think now you could hear that this
dance track was definitely way more
revealing
especially this 909 kick drum made both
because rattle a bit although the
tribute was still cleaner the Vavoom
became quite messy afterwards after the
kick together with the whole arrangement
the snare all this little stuff made it
sound really really quite bad you
couldn't hear it from the classical
music so for people who only listened to
classical music
they might even not notice all the
errors of the if you listen over just
some full-range speaker
you won't probably notice
intermodulation distortion all four inch
rather suffer from this therefore you
have to add some Twitter or some
additional second weight whatever but
you get you have to fight with other
problems then with time domain with no
with frequency with the crossover and so
on and so on
sound dispersion so just listening to
classical music it's nice and I listen
to classical music but I won't use it
for speaker testing because it doesn't
reveal anything except if a speaker
sounds really off if it has some zigzag
frequency response then you will hear
that something is wrong but most because
sound okay with me too except yeah
bangle dollars because take the
Mendelssohn pure play a - it sounds so
Hollow still people can listen to this
but it has such a strange mid response
and people think it sounds balanced so
this was classical versus electronica
what else do I have
yeah this is the bank you travel two or
three what is it I don't know it's an
electrostatic speaker and let's play
some solo piano stuff first so you will
really only hear piano mostly mates
quite complex frequency spectrum but not
as revealing maybe and let's compare it
against yeah maybe the FIFA Helsinki
which I didn't put it put here now but
we will switch between these two
so yeah I'm not quite sure what to say
usually electrostatic speakers are
famous for their precision especially
with mitts and Trevor but here with this
solo piano track it was not that easy to
maybe say I could maybe even hear some
more direct sound out of them
Thank You tremolo and now let's play
again a so personam princess freesia
track which so many hate because I don't
know it's not natural whatever and let's
compare these two speakers again
yeah and I think now it was easily here
able which speaker renders this
correctly or normally yeah the FIFA made
the sound quite close to the original it
has a pretty flat response why the Bank
you being some electrostatic twelve some
dynamic drivers it was some miss I mean
it sounded just horrible you couldn't
hear it that well through the solo piano
track and but as soon as there is more
going around more frequencies more a
dancer mix yeah we will maybe have a
look at some spectrograms later on I
think this example also showed that in
my case the music that I would have
chosen would immediately reveal the
differences and this is what my channel
is about I want to demonstrate you as
easy as quick as possible how the one
sounds compared to the other one I
cannot play just one and expect from you
that you can judge the sound because you
have no absolute reference but in this
case you can compare to relatively and
with the piano track or with the
classical you're probably wouldn't say
you couldn't hear classical music
doesn't contain real bass notes like
electronica music which offer has
frequencies below 20 Hertz
I mean bass lines down to 40 30 that you
can distinctly here with some speakers
we played often tracks with this NCS
that had really deep frequencies that
you don't hear it with smallest because
but all the larger ones play them easily
without distortion so maybe another last
example acoustic music because it's so
revealing so let's listen to the downy
a7 this is the retune version which was
not made by me my when I gave them my
suggestions I tried to make it sound
quite natural then they somehow change
the tuning and it sounds like this so
let's play me some acoustic Peter first
and compare it against the denim and
yeah maybe you can already hear some
differences here both speakers have some
some sterile enhancement some artificial
hello max max 3d or whatever so both
already create and nights
nice soundstage but with the solo Gaeta
track it's not that easy to say which
one sounds correct so let's check them
now
yeah I could only hear that the Donnie
was way more hissy yeah there was some
hiss in the background but now let's try
some heavy metal or rock track which is
some kind of modulated pink noise so you
have all frequencies represented with
this distorted guitars and so on very
dense and we will hopefully hear which
one renders it correctly
yeah I mean against the donee the denon
suddenly sounded muffled although you
could hear it's way more balanced way
more precise the Donnie made some mess
out of this song still acceptable with
this acoustic guitar track but as soon
as some more complex arrangements
electronic I don't know heavy metal
regardless you can immediately hear the
flaws of a speaker so to conclude this
topic I'm not playing music or no
acoustic music because I don't like it
or because my taste in music is bad I
simply think that it doesn't reveal it
won't reveal any or any significant
differences over this video so I try I
often sit for hours
comparing back and forth especially
worse because that sound quite similar
to each other it's really hard to find
tracks that reveal this particular
frequency that is off some speakers have
just some hump or some some deep in some
particular freak frequency area that you
usually won't hear with many tracks
depending on a mix depending on the
circle of confusion it might even be
that the speaker that sounds off some
somehow better because just the mix is
bad but then you put up some particular
track and it it it reveals this this
this this error of the speaker so my
take on this that classical music
acoustic music vocal music is not best
for speaker testing check Hammonds
research they also say that some rock
jennipher walls or whatever they
selected these tracks for as being
reference for a kind of recording type
because the recordings different way too
much on the sound quality depending on
how great the engine is how could their
monitoring system is the recording
system and then on top of this it comes
the mastering which puts again some
effects to make it louder to push it
more forward so you will never hear the
the original sound so an acoustic guitar
recorded will never sound like an
acoustic guitar in your room you will
recognize it as an acoustic guitar but
won't have the impression as if the kita
was playing here because you hear lava
the the original room where it was
recorded together with your room
acoustics which alters the sound already
there for my purpose my my my idea was
always to offer you a quick way to
compare speakers to each other and I
tried to selecting tracks which vocals
are not always revealing needs often
sound nice to a speaker it starts to
become wonky in the trail and bass area
if a speaker has meat off like many bang
losses because then he will hear it
immediately they sound some hollow honky
a bad treble and bass is most because
simply struggle especially this bottom
portable ones that I usually try to
offer you and show you what the bigger
speakers like my audio pros sometimes
it's not easy to really hear the
differences especially if you are
recording listened on your site through
some crappy headphones because I doubt
many of you are using some high-end
headphones with a flat response or tuned
to be flat so they listen over some
cheap I don't know cause pata Pro and
think they can really judge the sound of
course all the cause the thinner speaker
will maybe sound better because the
other one would appear more boomy that
causes or you some some bass boost
therefore the relative difference is to
demonstrate you I need to use some high
bandwidth signal yeah I forgot I wanted
to show you some some spectrograms like
we have from the vocal from Princess
Rita so this is the solo vocal already
looks quite complex but you can see most
of the Mizzou is around up to maybe 4
kilohertz above that is probably just
this breathing from here so if we look
at the spectrogram of the full
arrangement you can see that there is
way more going on so you have the snare
which adds some some frequencies the
bass and so on and so on
if we look at the classical track so the
classical track is very there is nothing
just some some mash you see also up to
maybe 2 3 kilohertz so if I put the what
was the track are there dense track so
it's really the whole frequency spectrum
is filled out and you get some attacks
you
get some some some some pauses which
with the classical track was just some
some some no real attacks so you cannot
judge the transients well how the
speaker behaves with first at texting
and so on and so on the same with the
solo guitar track look at this
so quite interesting spectrogram you can
see the upper tones there form ends of
the guitar and quite nice and the heavy
metal track is way denser so really up
to 20 kilohertz everything for therefore
I don't want to talk about the stopping
anymore please don't tell me use some
acoustic track because it reveals or you
cannot listen to electronic music over
speakers to judge the song quality of
course I can because the electronic
music is what makes the speaker really
suffer this this heavy bass often down
to 20 Hertz and you hear that the bass
reflex port heart suddenly or the you
can hear that the main brain cannot
cannot it deforms it cannot move in such
a way it cannot extend and so on his own
so I think the type of that of music
that I selected or I try to select I
always stay try to stay within my my
taste I won't play I don't know country
or I really I I hate hip-hop because
it's not music from you just some sample
beats with some vocals so it has also
heavy bass so you can judge it you can
maybe judge some speakers for their bass
response but I don't listen to rap and
and trap and crap and everything so I
still to try finding tracks from my
repertoire I would have liked to play
para straights Pink Floyd Beach Boys
Beatles but it's all copyrighted stuff I
already have to think around that a
little bit to find tracks which are
still copyrighted but maybe not
recognized by YouTube's Content ID so a
rather trying to find some obscure
tracks I would have liked to really play
some reference tracks
there are some that I used on every
audio exhibition you can hear the same
tracks because they think or they are
regarded as reference but I cannot play
them due to copyright so I try to find
tracks that are still revealing but
somehow enjoyable as well so Paul from
Pierce audio yeah tell me if you could
hear the high pitch tone I doubt I mean
in five six years if I continued
listening over headphones I probably
won't hear it either but I'm still happy
to hear up to 60 milli 17 kilo Hertz I
could easily hear above 20 kilohertz we
made it once at school with some
frequency generator he pushed it towards
21 and towards 20 and I could still hear
it I was probably the only one I can
also hear in beds when they are flying
around it's this high-pitched it but
it's not 20 it's something below so they
have some really yeah I think this was
it I hope you like this I hope I could
clear up some confusion about this topic
because I really think I am doing my
best I try to select tracks that are
somehow revealing and can offer you an
idea how these two speakers compare if I
play just some acoustic stuff you won't
hear anything
it may sound nice you may enjoy the
music but it's not about music enjoyment
here rather about speaker tasting and
showing where the flaws of a speaker
when I get a new speaker I listen a lot
with different kind of music to find
this errors where the speaker really has
some flaw it's not easy if I just listen
to classical music I probably won't
notice but I too might be hesitant
people still complain so and don't want
to volume anymore it was already long
enough
so Paul sorry but
acoustic music is not the best for
speaker testing it's nice to listen to
and I also love to listen to - Simone or
whatever
then Warwick any kind of music I like
pop I like but I usually don't play it
but for revealing for demonstrating you
the differences it won't reveal anything
therefore I don't play it sometimes when
I think there is some issue with meets
whether vocal suddenly sounds I did this
with the Bo play it to it sounded
horrible of classical music compared
against the Viva it sounded just like
some some some saw some some chainsaw so
you could easily hear that the pendulum
sounds off although the classical
orchestra nobody can prove that it was
recorded in a way which represents the
orchestra we hundred percent is
different if you sit in a concert and
listen to it you get lots of room
ambience you hear more early reflections
than from the orchestra because it's far
away 3040 meters
if you accept if you are maybe sitting
at the front at the first row but if you
are rather at the back you hear more of
the room and who knows how its recorded
if it's recorded with just one
microphone or if or if there are several
microphones that pick up several parts
and then mix together again leveled
through the engineer and maybe pushed
some frequencies so yeah but this is how
today's recording unfortunately without
any reference without any standard
without any norm and we are again with
this audios circle of confusion and
really quite surprised that so many
audiophile lovers or audio fools maybe
don't know or are not aware of this
audios circle of confusion they really
think that an acoustic instrument played
over their speakers would represent how
the acoustic instrument sounds in real
life no unfortunate doesn't so a
recording will never represent the real
sound
except maybe binaural recordings heard
over headphones this is why I really
concentrate on this topic it's the only
way to really show you how a particular
sound source we gotta do if a speaker or
something
if you hear over a referenced pair of
headphones then you get all the natural
ambience the room the whole yet the
whole sound you just need a really
reference pair of headphones best would
be maybe some automatic that omit all
ear resonances eternal resonances and
tuned for that you can maybe get an idea
of how some particular sound source
sounds in reality an orchestra recorded
by some artificial head which again has
different ears than yours so you would
probably have to record it by your own
ears it's not easy so a recording will
never represent the reality there were
some funny studies in the 30s 40s where
they compared a recording of of a singer
back and forth in a blind test and
somewhere holding their dose is probably
because of he had some breath smell or
whatever so there is lots of research
done but it's still impossible to
represent the reality acoustically maybe
with a binaural with an optimized
binaural recording technique but not on
an orchestra recorded by 10 or 12 pairs
of microphones and then mixed together
it doesn't represent how it sounds in
reality it just sounds may be nice over
a pair of speakers but it doesn't sound
like it sounds in reality I mean if you
go to a live band a jazz concert and
listen to it life and then listen some
life recording of a jazz band over
either headphones or us because it
doesn't sound the same it's a completely
different sonic brush but I really I
want to stop all this I hope I didn't
bore you too much I hope I could really
mmm
close this topic about music choice and
I hope others you get the idea
yeah thanks for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
