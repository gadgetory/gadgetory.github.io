going to have a look at the Pioneer xwb
TSP 70 yeah this is I don't quite
managed to learn the strange name by
heart so far I haven't found this
speaker on any US tour so I'm not sure
if it's really available there but you
can find it on the German Amazon store
166 in black here also in white 441 at
the cheaper and it's also available on
the British MSN store although not the
new speaker anymore there was an offer
on I boot for 80 euros so exactly the
same price that I bought the Harman
Kardon Onix meaning also from adult and
adult we shall check it out later on
we'll also compare these two but first
let's have a look at the speaker
completely out of metal so pretty heavy
close to 1 kilogram I would say and at
the packaging says 8.5 hours of battery
life you can see it has also started
pairing with another one in case you
have two of them so here are two drivers
and two passive radiators
although there is strange yeah there are
hidden here so you can see there is some
air sleep so when with really heavy base
movement there will be some airflow it
will test this out so let's turn it on
maybe what these are the welcome tones
so it's already connected and if we
start some frequency generator we will
see what happens
yeah we are should go yeah there is lots
of vibration the speaker itself vibrates
a lot as the participators are only at
one side yeah it becomes quite a bit out
of balance and you can see it also moves
around you can also hear slightly the
airflow I was talking about so I'm not
sure why they really had to close this
area here if this gives you some
advantage but there is really lots of
vibration with this speaker you can see
it moves and dances around yet but apart
from that and before having this maybe
let's check out some frequency response
measurements and you can see a little
bit strange there is some peak at around
70 to 73 Hertz meets and treble are
quite neutral but there is a strange dip
in between we can also check out some
lower volumes as you can see the bass
peak becomes higher than maybe this is a
kind of loudness compensation but yeah
not really
while at maximum as you can see here
bass reduction becomes pretty strong
although the speaker cannot play that
loud so I thought we should check it out
how it sounds and before comparing it
against the Harman Kardon Onix mini I
thought we should compare it against the
reverb on 21st this is a $60 beaker so
even cheaper than their discounted one
so are not 66 euros against 60 euros as
always here please listen as headphones
as this is a binaural recording and the
first track I will play is from a Dutch
group called Joel featuring this guy
this is a funny retro disco track called
I wanna be a BG I will start with the
Pioneer first so please have a listen
you
and he's so big
but you want his people
on the hit me
honest
yeah you can maybe hear that the lava
120 plays more open also slightly more
dynamic let's try maybe another track
and kind of smoothness and volume is not
synced so you can see we already maximum
here and we are playing it around 2/3
closer to 3/4 as increase volume
flattening
do something else
you
also here's Becky more balanced a world
with nice a treble
of other things should be some kind of
hair professionally as some enhanced
hello face a metric and you can hear
that the basis simply cleaner here
there's a lot on 20 although quite prone
to distortion of higher level managers
these strong kicks but as we've seen
from the measurement if we reduce volume
the base will become stronger here why
the valve on 20 may appear maybe
slightly same but you hear the one note
base only one frequency that is boosted
yeah I think it already moved a little
so let's increase volume again and you
can hear how the dynamic start school
will get similar although this cutting
comedy scratchy maybe let's try now
track and although the government 20 not
an obstacle or a very loud speakers you
can hear it though some mascara the dawn
$20 with extreme hello
station for the pan you will be the
poster also the volume 23 not that loud
this is the volume 20 increasing value
collection no no I
we can offer here much many come from
another incentive
you can real household they attacked and
everything
so let's try the Onyx you know we'll
have to match volume for both our own 20
will go away on me
also from I boot for 80 euros so here
those should be quite comparable and
let's start with an a track I hope
volumes will be seen lightly to the fair
Pena but it doesn't make this strong
tell us a correction from the panel
there's definitely something floating
around here now
a place people a dynamic the only thing
slave everything and this
on from our cruise minute
the much more air between the instrument
while we are everything that comes from
us christabella something else also
listen here to the drums and how to end
of the day
is already compressing or doing print
shop come on okay
[Laughter]
yeah yeah you can hear the drums and
bass guitar
while here the case melted together with
the bass drum
they disappeared mullet
let's check again how loud they both can
play this is say man you know increasing
volumes for maximum now that onyx meal
hours everybody do something else
oh yes the difference is pretty obvious
I think here for 166 euros completely
overpriced I would say even for 80 I
think there are letters because around
it's not a decent I mean quite nice for
low levels but many others just as nice
or even nicer also this vibration you
could hear it with some bass notes yeah
that was rattling and so on so it's
really heavy so it definitely way
heavier than this Onix mean hear or
sleep for or something I'm not sure if
the original price is really justified
it's a nice speaker also design wise but
you can see pretty pronto to
Singaporeans and everything and I just
think that this sound is other SH in
this class so I hope this could give you
an idea about the pannier a little see
again ex love you BTS p70 umm yeah it
has effects and fun but I don't think
it's really needed for this speaker as
the treble is not bad but mm doesn't
have this nice putter from from many
others yeah we are just charging in and
everything so nothing really special
yeah so if you I'm sure there will be
further discount for this on a boat just
like the Onyx mini which I think it's
already the third pan discounted so if
you have to decide between the foetus I
would definitely take the hammock Adam
and it total order myself sound somehow
but this place nicely at low levels
still I think there are some patterns
and then only buy a mini still sounds
better than this so yeah I hope this
could give you an idea about it yeah
maybe it's not that bad that it's not at
all in America it's nothing that special
but look at the grill not really visible
there is some strange pattern here so
exist they had blown up not sure
if you can see this yeah I mean it has
some nice design buttons but really
sound like nothing special so thanks for
watching have a nice time and see you in
the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
