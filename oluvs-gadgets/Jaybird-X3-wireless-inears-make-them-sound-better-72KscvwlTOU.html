did want to leave any further in yes
anymore I think I'm done with this topic
without the most important ones the
great sounding moans 90 95 % are crap
anyhow although people don't seem to
realize this they buy this overpriced
crap anyhow the market is flooded with
this junk and any you in here again get
some hype around it so I cannot quite
understand it it's all to me
also recording them offering your valid
sound samples is quite a hassle it takes
lots of time and I'm not hundred percent
satisfied with the results it's probably
the system here which is not good enough
I would need something better more
expensive which I cannot afford also in
reading through some comments with
people complaining that I bash is
something hideous why they think they
sound great so my gear is 14 my ears are
faulty or and biased or whatever yeah
I'm a little bit bored with this topic
that I wanted to stop but I think this
particular in here that jaybird x3 needs
some attention I think some of you
mentioned it in some comments I never
really considered it because any in here
I bought based on recommendations from
you was just junk except some particular
models but most of these and they just
don't sound good we can as if from
Sennheiser from Gaia dynamic the
momentum through Wireless yes this
doesn't sound good
maybe you cannot find the same level but
people obviously don't care about Peaks
if it's closer to the Hammond response
target maybe they don't hear it maybe
I'm too sensitive I'm not quite sure but
yeah I think we cannot really find this
this this equal level and still I wanted
to cover this because it was brought to
my attention by Yuri
I saw a review on head file that he made
on the Sony MH 755 a deep analyzes also
suggesting some mods some equalizing to
bring it in closer to the harmony
response target which is I think an
important basis I mean it's maybe to
paste heavy is maybe to 12 a V or
whatever but the general curve the
response that you should get with this 3
kilohertz beacon song without any
additional strange stuff
I think a basis which should be worked
on and many years for many tunings
simply ignore this they had a flat
response at the eardrum which was just
here
it's not how in India our headphone
should sound so I commented on his
review I mean he has a deep knowledge
not only about in ears also about
measurements ends on his own and he
suggested me to try some wireless ones
and one of them being some jaybird
models also from Gibran there is the X 2
X 3 X 4 the newest one they all sound
model is the same also their freedom
model the freedom to not it's more
bass-heavy from what I've seen you can
also check out the measurements from
ratings should see if they sound or look
the same also some some sports model but
I think that X 3 X 4 are the top models
they also have a HC Bluetooth encoding
which improves sound quality the others
may produce group of artifacts and
although it's not a true wireless small
we can see there is a wire in between I
think it's quite nice so you wear it
like this you see the remote is usually
at the right side and they also come
with these ear hooks or whatever that
are like - they are meant to be held
better inside but my case they don't
work they pull the tip out instead of
fixing it somehow so I am Not sure maybe
I'm doing something wrong but without
these I can get the tip more or less
stable charging is done by this strange
docking station or whatever so it goes
like this then to USB unfortunately it
would be it it would have been nice if
it had a normal micro USB connector or
something but you you need to carry
around this this part thing thingie here
inside the box are let's have a look
not easy to open so you have this this
ouchie here some additional tips also
calm please and three pairs of these ear
hooks different sized ones what else
nothing part and there is also a way put
this away and on my way is like this so
behind your neck but you can also wear
them the other way around so above your
ears but you can see the the cable is so
stiff it won't stay above your ear
anyhow there is some some clip so you
can clip it together here maybe and then
it should fix it to your head I find it
a little bit uncomfortable I also prefer
it over the head over the ear but like
this so below my neck so I don't need
any additional still you can see it
doesn't hold here so you get less cable
noise microphonic sore whatever and this
fixes it a little bit I can fix it - no
but there is a nice feature you get an
app you can swipe left and right channel
depending on how you wear them which is
of course nice and it comes with a
really extensive parametric equalizer
quite unique I've never experienced
something like this so it says the
settings into the in-ear and I think you
need it because with the stock settings
and with the stock tips doesn't sound
good first maybe let's turn it on you
get some voice prompts and melodies can
be annoying a little bit power on
haven't connected fully charged I mean I
turn it on and then I put it inside my
head the only annoying thing is when I
reduce volume to a minimum you get a
loud beep so not that great and before
talking about the sounds maybe I would
like to show you some measurements so
this is with the original stock tips for
a left hand right
and you can see there is some slight
weirdness here especially this deep the
left one has it at 1.7 kilo Hertz maybe
the right one has it at 2.2 peanuts I'm
really not true where this deep comes
from if it's a measuring error of this
year's system here because I haven't
seen them that pronounced in any other
measurements neither from URI know from
ratings but you also see this huge peak
here at 7 8 kilohertz mmm
so they sound just crappy also too much
base if you after hamon response target
so I will simply let's look at just the
left one I'm really not quite sure where
this strange deep I don't hear it that a
deep is not as pronounced or it not as
here above as a peak so usually when you
get some deep with speakers and you want
to equalize it you will let the deep but
rather equalize the pigs away so this is
original tips so let's try other tips
you can see the tip here has a very
small opening I'm not sure if you can
see this and this is what causes this
resonance look here I have another tip
way bigger you remember we had the same
problem with the with the tribute x1
Wireless it needs simply a different tip
to sun-god because otherwise the treble
changes in this case we get this peak
you can see like this also it's it's
exposed this driver unit or the mesh
also fits fits nicely stays inside not
that well so after some time it it falls
out and with this tip the sound looks
like that
you see the the peak went away it
shifted towards 11 kilohertz
already sounds way better although
treble is slightly too pronounced it
comes although also with this complex
but the complex are again covering this
nozzle too much nozzle muzzle too much
so they reduce travel too much here I
have accompli it looks as if it was cut
by our
this is from the one more triple driver
you can see it's small is the same like
like the other tip that I had just that
it's for me it tastes better inside
isolates nicer and smoothness travel
even more so how does it look with this
with this complete tip here
okay see not much difference just travel
gets reduced slightly but with this
response you can work way better with
the equalizer and the equalizer is
really really extensive it's a five band
parametric equalizer so you can define
the game frequency so you can move them
freely you can see they have no no fixed
band or whatever and you can also define
the Q factor so how how narrow or how
broad it is you can really do too heavy
stuff here nice thing is it works
sometimes there is some slight delay so
also when switching between one setting
and the other also great this you have
some history so you can switch through
all settings that you did which is
really really unique and you can save
the setting publish it online there are
tons of different I checked some but
they are mostly just increase based it's
already quite a base area in here and
but I think with V with this tool you
can bring it to some really
yeah really high-level so I will show
you my neutralizing look first I will
show you the Sony image one response all
uncompensated so let's put away the
other ones just leave the accomplice and
this one image one and you can see they
are quite close except this is accurate
1.7 kilo at the peak at 2.8 or whatever
is a little bit more pronounced than
treble in the area of 4 5 6 and
kilohertz is a little bit lower on the
ex crib so this is my equalizer setting
you can see i reduced bass i reduced
also this area around to 3 kilo hertz
boost the treble boost it up or treble
my EQ setting looks like this let me see
and yeah I think it sounds really nice
and I would like to show you I will put
it inside here with the only tips first
and I will simply switch between the
tips first you will hear the original
tips then the the alternative ones do
you see with the bigger opening I'm not
quite sure where they are from which
which in here I have another one which
also works look they look more less like
the comp list here the same just that
it's silicon but these silicon tips
don't stay that instead well inside like
the completes the companies started to
extend so I prefer them with the
companies and this equalizer preset so
first we will hear of course the
original track analog from so Poisson
process fusion it's a nice repeating
pattern so we can hear the changes nice
nicely you will hear the the original
tips then the alternative ones then the
comp list and then I will start to
switch between different EQ settings not
all are mine also some other ones so
that you can hear what kind of sound
changes you can achieve I mean I didn't
want to use these extreme ones which
boost bass to the extreme there is one
which is called I think heavy metal -
just bass yeah I'm not
how someone can listen to this and later
on will maybe compare it to something
else so let's have a listen
I think you'd hear in this case the
choice of the right tip makes a huge
difference
the original tips are just horrible I'm
not sure why they included them they
need some completely different tips like
this here with this it always sounds way
nicer and then you simply find you under
sound a little bit yeah I'm not sure if
I covered everything but let's compare
it against some other in here not quite
sure I mean these recordings should give
you just an idea about the sound you
know you're here it sounds okay it
doesn't sound off in any way now with
the comp lists and equalizer that I
applied here but you cannot hear the
really nuances so it's simply impossible
because every in-ear react somehow
differently this you can Ollie is very
short so it doesn't have the impedance
of a human ear therefore I am NOT a
satisfied but to conclude all this I'm
not sure it's compared against the Sony
image one maybe which is a nicely tuned
one or against the moon drop tennis pro
which costs more is not wireless also a
little bit more cumbersome maybe to wear
so let's compare it to the moon drop
tennis pro although don't take the sound
samples absolutely rather relatively to
each other but at the end you can tell
me my 10 your opinion about it so let's
have a listen again
is it just a treat my loving inside my
fantasies call to me you worries my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you
am i searching you I wanna feel every
part of these
I must confess I am positively surprised
and quite impressed with them they offer
you lots of tuning options and with the
right tips they only sound great it's a
pity that they are screwed up by this
original tips here also the measurements
from ratings show this peak they should
have maybe measured them with the
companies but the original companies are
not that great either because they
reduce travel too much so I had a cut in
behalf I didn't try it so I used this
foam is here from the triple driver
there are also different material little
bit harder it's it's more dense maybe
this foam and usually you don't need to
squeeze them just put them inside your
year and they already stay quite nicely
so I really like them with these tips
and some additional tuning boosting
treble slightly taste sound really
amazing I prefer them over most other
wired in years because it because they
are wireless so I can go out I could do
some some gardening or whatever isolate
nicely and if you want boost base if you
don't want base that much we'd use it I
tried to rather keep it closer to the
Sony image one response except bass but
you could hear with the there is some
still with the mids could be maybe
reduced slightly but the potential is
definitely there and I'm surprised that
this in here doesn't get more attention
I mean I saw some reviews or I didn't
watch them or didn't read them but many
people seem to be satisfied with them
I'm quite impressed really impressed and
thanks to Yuri to bringing them into my
attention because because yeah I love
them the only thing is that they are not
that comfortable he they remind me of
the Ultimate Ears
triple 510 which also was very
cumbersome toe to wear it rather sticks
out they are rather huge maybe the the
x4 easily be better it has some redesign
I think but it's ok if I have this
complex here put them nicely inside they
also stay inside
the remote yes between because when I
let me try like this when I have to make
this the remote is somewhere behind my
ear yeah
you can switch tracks by keeping plus or
minus pressed mmm which also I mean
during running you can so it's a little
bit weird I probably wouldn't use them
for running they are sweat proof the x4
is I think even completely waterproof
not quite sure about this but I thought
quite understand these hooks here what
how they should work I mean they maybe
fix them but at the same time they pull
them out so I never get as a real seal a
good seal yeah I think this was it for
the j-bird X 3 X 4 X 2 sounds awesome
all is the same I think they all are
supported by the by the same app let me
see we have the run or run XT the
perhaps Tara ha Tara Tara ran sounds a
bit Arabic we have the Tara Pro and the
freedom tool the freedom one is not
supported look yeah it is but has
different design maybe it's even more
comfortable to wear
I should try maybe another one the J bit
x4 looks a bit different these ear hooks
look softer somehow and I think it's
definitely worth trying out but you have
to experiment with tips and like I said
before a 30 40 % of the sound based on
the tips on the right tips and how they
how they work together with your ear
geometry so I'm done with the topic in
ears headphones and yeah I think we
found some models that are really great
forget the hype around many others
Sennheiser momentum true eyeless or
whatever forget it forget the pew play
e8 2.0 overhyped by so many of Flossie
kata said it's the best wireless in
I mean either he's deaf or he only
listens to bass or whatever I'm not sure
how angry I cannot understand all this
therefore for me the topic is closed we
have I recommended some nice in years I
will still expect the automatic er tool
to arrive but it will I think it will it
will be shipped in March so I will get
at the end of March and then I might do
another review on this maybe without
samples just giving you my thoughts on
the it tool versus they are two versus
the ER for but this sounds really nice
I'm quite impressed and I listen to them
for hours I think the battery life
estate is claimed with eight hours I
think it's ok really really a nice one
for one hundred hundred dollars or
something but I might try the other ones
too the freedom the first one is also I
think a a C decoding because if it just
falls back to SBC you will probably hear
some compression artifacts also
mentioned by Yuri she knows them all but
I got the x3 somehow as it seemed the
most normal the most all-around the one
but now I'm looking at all the others
here in the app I might maybe try
another one the first freedom the x4 is
a little bit more expensive not quite
sure so yeah I hope this was helpful a
bit and yeah see you in another video
maybe but probably not
with in ears or headphones but something
else yeah thanks all for watching and
see you then
