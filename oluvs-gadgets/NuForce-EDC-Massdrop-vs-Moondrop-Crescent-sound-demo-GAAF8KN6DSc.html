cover two different IM set ones which
are maybe not that comparable i would
also like to keep this video as short as
possible this time so not to talk too
much
simply offer you some sound samples and
at the end my resume but here i have the
moon drop quiz sent from china's or hii
india which cost around 30 dollars on
any Express and here the new force EDC
from mass drop for $60 so twice the
price
EDC stands for everyday carry dynamic in
a monitor high-resolution audio
I bought this based on a recommendation
from one of my viewers who told me it's
so great you should try it out I hardly
think back in November so it took two
months to arrive and it was quite a
disappointment in the box you can find
something carrying carrying pouch it
also comes with two two different wires
this one is with a remote and I think a
microphone this is a how is it called
when it's when it's turned around like
this this is a normal I am and you can
see it's worn like those typical in-ear
monitors so quite comfortable small
design also very very ergonomic nice
rounding so you hardly feel it the moon
drop recent on the other hand also comes
with some very simple pouch some
additional tips is this traditional
earbud design so you put it in like this
and it's fine but also very comfortable
comes only with this cable so you cannot
swept it what is nice is that there is a
ring at the left side which you can feel
so even at night you can feel which one
is left right so you simply pull it in
and can have a listen so feature wise
both a single dynamic driver design and
yeah let's have a listen I will put it
on put it in here and offer you some
sound samples three four songs not sure
I don't want to boil too much and keep
these recordings always with a little
bit of a reservation so don't take them
a solid percent or absolute sound if you
listen with some headphones it will
probably sound different but I think the
general tuning the general
characteristics of an inny is captured
quite well
also the relative differences so I will
start maybe with the original recording
which is the reference so you can hear
how it should sound then I will switch
over to the new was EDC and to the moon
drop Criss and back and forth and at the
end you will also hear the original
track again as reference so you you hear
how it should sound in reality so let's
is it just a dream
my baby inside my fantasies come to me
you are in my thoughts I never straight
from the heart of you
after
am i searching you I wanna feel
Hey
you know
man
I can't
avoid just the recording still I think
you can judge the sound characteristics
quite well from this especially the
relative differences and you could hear
there is only one winner the moon drop
christened it sounds way more balanced
wayne was buckling why the new first EBC
sound somehow muddy also way to Bumi and
treble has some strange characteristics
to it so it's somehow ringing whistling
so I'm really not sure why it was
recommended to me because it's really
not that great it's not horrible but
definitely nothing I would be raving
about so let's have a look at some
measurements on top you can see them
compensated for the diffused field
target in black the new for EDC and in
green the moon drop resent white below
you can see them raw uncompensated and
it's clearly visible that the new force
EDC has way too much bass especially in
the upper base region 2 3 400 Hertz our
way to boost it and it has too little
response in there five six seven
kilohertz region while treble has some
peak at around 11 kilohertz you can see
the one from the moon drop Chris and is
higher at around 12 13 kilowatts so a
boost at around 10 kilohertz gives
travel some ringing character which you
could hear from the recording as well so
I am really quite disappointed it cost
me around including Texas and shipping
Costner around 80 $90 to get it here and
the result is rather subpar I mean there
are no errors or there are no strange
Peaks or something but the overall
tuning is simply off and not that great
so the quiescent does a much better job
here I even liked it more than the more
expensive moon drop area so the
quiescent is quite a quite an
outstanding single driver in here and I
mean before spending $60 for this get a
Chris sent at Sony mh1 as Samsung as it
battle all these easily outperform the
new force EDC
so for me a huge disappointment is
before this price as it cost nearly
eighty ninety dollars to get it here I
only paid twenty 20 euros just for Texas
and custom fees so really really quite
disappointed and therefore yeah
understand that I cannot redo every
suggestion from you because they have
probably just as crappy
I'm aware that it will probably sound
different if you listen to it by
yourself and then compared to my
recording it just recording but the
relative differences are quite captured
well I had a listen back and forth
between both and this sounds really
muddy and way to boo me so it's not a in
India for everyday carry or let alone
everyday listening
yeah I will probably put it away and
never open never try it again because
it's nothing really great so again the
moonwalk recent really nice sounds a
little different to the Sony image one I
like it maybe even slightly better or
subtly isn't hardly any sample variation
so with this own image one I have some
units and all were a little bit
different so here probably they are much
better very simple design also that my
eyes knives or rather Daniel free tangle
free tangle tangle you know it dangles
mm-hmm and I like it a lot definitely
recommend it for a simple one driver
dynamic in here as opposed to most those
hyped ones yes Sun is setting this going
down I hope like this anyhow I didn't
want to bore you too much simply cover
two different IMS at once I have many
more which I would also like but the
moon drop Crescent is definitely highly
recommended really nice natural tuning a
little bit to bass heavy but compared to
the new force et Cie it was even flat
sounding because this has very the upper
base is way to boost it meets are quite
similar on both and then it starts again
upper mids lower treble is somehow
missing and you get this peak at around
1011 kilohertz which which always like
we had from the fire fh1 also had the
speaker thank you notes which just
sounded off so yeah thanks for watching
I hope this was a little bit helpful mm
I wouldn't recommend the new force EDC
not true out there edie 3 and all the
others but yeah I mean this cost already
twice the price and this worse so maybe
the other ones costing even more
can be close to this or maybe even not I
heard in years yeah for 10 times the
price which which were worse so don't
take the price into into the final
judgment of an of an in year or of the
sound of anemia yeah again things are
for watching ants in the next video bye
bye
now the Sun is already gone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
