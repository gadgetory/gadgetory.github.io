yes this package has got to have some
minutes ago and I'm pretty sure that you
will be quite excited to know what is
inside you can already see it here
comment so yeah what is inside you JBL
click for and I thought we will do this
together short and quick unboxing yeah I
also wear my vinyl microphone so we can
immediately check it out have a very
short listen how it sounds this is my
bill so yeah
invoice I bought it it's not a free
sample or something
you're quite a big packaging for a small
speaker like this shade is 54.4 sweet
here is the 3 and here is before so we
can immediately compare them LEDs
I think it has improved somewhat or at
least I hope it yes still see you let's
cut this away here and let's open the
magic box yes some nice symbol and see
the speaker is only rebel flag I think
it also the nicest color looks a bit
different now maybe a bit bigger I think
yeah but not by much you can see it
still more like this then he compared to
the charge 3 years so it's really a lot
of fear much smaller or the oxygen side
nothing just the wire Providence please
be charging wire yeah nothing else price
is a bit steep you in Europe I think 149
Tom as i pre-ordered it I got some
discomfort cost 225 euros it's still a
bit more expensive than in the US if you
can get it for $99 there so the European
prices are a little bit exaggerated and
let's look again yeah the back is
obviously a bit different also that
pesky freighters are out of plastic now
um yeah let's turn it on a mutant and
see what happens if something happens eh
the same tones we already know from all
the other JBL speakers here it is
JBL fit for me let's put the charge
three again away yeah you can see I'm a
little bit excited tool and let's turn
on the flip three as well and we can we
can really have a shot listen yeah the
first track will be from what we have
here um some places vision and I will
start with the neck flip three how I
want it to hear that reporter it sounds
quite similar I think me
no the fourth zone
let me see here are also cooler you can
hear it
also volume curve things would be a
little bit different this is the very
first volume step on the flip phone
let's check their flip three yes it's a
bit louder but not by much
so let's increase volume again for the
space half way as well you can see I
have to increase more in order to have
the fun loudly quite a bit more function
planar track 15 is way more teeny well
not necessarily Nakata Thank You thinner
will be much more fun
I can also feel it goes quite a bit
there on all the kings all the lead in
my head why the report is really deep
and also it doesn't stand s table and
you can see here they have obviously
behind the redesign for people it
doesn't roll away that much as the old
one
let's check T Corrigan
come on technique then I still sound
maybe slightly over exaggerated 12 let's
check it you can hear that bass is
really nice here at 6 3 then getting a
bit confused with refit for charge
retouch tool but doesn't have that nice
day what we could do is maybe compare it
against the charge 3 instead so it fall
against charge 3 I want to how these two
will sound yes I'm sure the charge we
will still sound quite a bit fuller but
doesn't have this trail definition so
this is the charge 3 now
if a cooler punch maybe not as boosted
but you can hear the travel is way
better here
I become pretty colors compare let's try
maybe another track
listen click for know the travel doesn't
sound right here
why don't we pour vinegar crisps my
clarity if you can hear the bass is
pretty nice maybe not as strong a combat
charge 3 yeah I think it's comparable to
them to the Onyx mini I have here so
let's try this maybe oh yeah
so let's check this tool this is the
Alex we know I take it slightly more
punching strong a bass
I would have to lower treble that only
promising you would need to take off the
cover here turn it off not easy
resistance is more profitable develop
Friday
and I really wonder how long the
flipcore can play and according to their
volume curve get the sonic villain oh we
are already around 2/3 meeting so
increasing volume for maximum and look
for
yeah the support doesn't have the strong
base of the onyx need loudness wise
quite comparable but I think it's quite
impressive definitely better than the
flick three I will turn this off again
and it seems to be quite a bit of an
improvement the treble appears a bit
harsh to me now but let's have a look
here here just charging in and auxiliary
and from what I heard it's completely
waterproof so it will probably swing we
will of course test this out as well so
stay tuned for more I will maybe try
comparing both in a more detailed way
also added to the database as soon as
possible maybe this week already but I
think yeah so far
and pretty impressed especially based
here what we could try maybe um do this
turned off check the base response of
both with some focus generator here I
have it called signal generator and yeah
the three three is going to be 80 Hertz
guess what you hear airflow a sled like
this
it definitely more stable now this is
nice because before I always had to put
this rope behind in order to make it
more stable so PBL improved quite a bit
so this is the sleep 3s lip formula has
to increase volume slightly
yeah here's some light rattling from the
specific vehicle and let's go down sixty
six Hertz
let's sleep three yeah this is not a
real bass tone anymore
just some upper tones you can hear it
goes down to maybe 65 hot still usable
base it's going to have 670 but it
really starts running off below 65 which
is of course nice the c3 doesn't reach
that deep this is just from here
guarantee it's also not clean it's not
only a signed form more a kind of
triangle over although I can hear some
rattling
yeah okay there is some vibration with
the enclosure
it shouldn't be
maybe this year long
no blunder it's definitely from
yes of course
maybe sample variation so you you have
to see but you can hear nice interesting
bass response and yeah for it became
empty when I first impression I think
this is enough already quite long I hope
you liked it for five oh and see you in
the next video he'll attack experiment
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
