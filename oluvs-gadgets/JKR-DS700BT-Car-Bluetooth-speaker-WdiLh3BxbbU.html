you had a nice Christmas I hope Santa
Claus was generous with you as well and
my son also got a nice present from
Santa this car here which is in reality
a Bluetooth speaker here currently on
Amazon you can get it for $22 you can
see it comes with a packaging like this
has some nice features yeah Bluetooth FM
radio SD card playback
it has also USB port for charging out
there is a battery included a
rechargeable this is this typical I
think Nokia uses the same ones and yeah
I thought it will check it out how it
sounds so my son will turn it on
shots b10 yeah and you can see it
connects as d s something D is 700 700
BT we have it here and let's check out
some tunes how it sounds as always I'm
using my normal microphones so please
listen with headphones
I mean it's not the best sound you can
get but I think for the price and also
it's quite a decent suit I'll consider
that basically either here two drivers
one left and one right
maybe silica will increase volume
slightly and you can play also quite
loud
although there is some slight distortion
maximum or something like that we can
maybe compare it against the JBL gold
which of course sounds a little bit
better but it doesn't look like a car
doesn't have these flashing lights you
can see there are some nice lights here
and this is of course an omnidirectional
speaker because the driver fires upwards
I'm not sure if the backlight also
no he's no better I thought there was
some big light as well let's switch to
the JBL go again
it sounds slightly cooler maybe not rack
so what we could also tries maybe check
the left criteria there is no wheels
left right but only an up and down
stereo you can hear this is the left
this is the right driver but you get
some spacious sound because of this so
yeah
currently available on Amazon for $22
you have the link in the description of
this video that is this it's off this
video
you think it's fatik but i also saw it
on Aliexpress for $16 so if you found it
discounted yeah there are some other
ones but this was the cheapest this is
also the one we got here
not yeah he likes black more
yeah it's available in different colors
also black red silver yeah you can see
the SD card charging is done through a
mini USB not micro and this is obsidian
so I think it's pretty nice because it's
our shaman so if you need now yeah it's
turned off so if you need some present
for your son who likes music as well
yeah I think this is perfect yeah I hope
you like this that's all for watching
and see you in the next video have a
nice time and bye bye now Kristen
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
