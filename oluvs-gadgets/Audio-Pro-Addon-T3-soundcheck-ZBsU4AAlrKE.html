show you the audio pro I don't III audio
Pro is a Swedish company and they
already have many different Bluetooth
speakers on the market but the ed on T 3
is the first portable unit audio
proclaims 30 hours of battery life at
medium volume and 12 hours at maximum
which is really impressive I mean if you
look at other companies like for example
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen they claim 24 hours for
their Bo play a 2 but when you crank the
speaker to maximum you will get mixing
one hour and then the speaker reduces
volume to half the same with Ultimate
Ears they claim 15 or 20 hours for the
mega boom but if you play that maximum
it will die after 3 hours and a half so
12 hours at maximum is pretty impressive
I mean the speaker can play loud but
it's not a boombox I mean this is more
tuned for hi-fi if we put it against the
JBL extreme the JBL extreme is more
speaker for outdoors its Tunes really
bass heavy this is more neutral sounding
of course I did some measurements and as
you can see the frequency response is
pretty smooth you only get some bigger
bass boost at 200 Hertz but apart from
that it's really flat and even what else
to say you don't need any charger just
plug in a cable it can also charge
external devices here you have the
auxiliary in and this is the bass reflex
port the battery is exchangeable by the
way so just open these screws and if the
battery dies you can put anyone inside
yeah the operation is pretty simple you
have to keep the power button pressed
for some second here you see the battery
life you can switch between auxiliary
Bluetooth and so on pairing button
volume
well nothing fancy just the speaker yeah
with good sound the grip is a bit I
don't know for my hands as you can see
it's really not very maybe this leather
will become looser after
time but for my hand it's simply too too
narrow I cannot I cannot really yeah
carry it like that and of course I would
like to show you how this speaker sounds
as always I will be using high quality
binaural microphones unfortunately I
don't have any speaker like that a
comparable one I mean maybe the both
something 3 but this wipes the floor
with the with the bows so I will just
probably take the JBL extreme for you
too so that you have a kind of
comparison of course please use
headphones for listening as binaural
recordings require headphones for the
best results so please put up your
headphones and have a listen I will turn
both on now and as you can see the t3 is
a serious speaker it doesn't do any
strange tones and alert unlike the JBL
and i will start playing with the audio
pro addon t3 first let's have a listen
maybe something else again with the t-3
first
yeah
it sounds more lifelike more true here
listen one - special so - yes an
astronaut
of course both because don't give any
right any real stereo separation let's
listen to this track it's quite a bit
more bass heavy
 dances to rhythms of rainbows a
ballet of moonlight star should bring
them light for the future shows you who
you are with some kind of just fun
it would sound definitely better like
that
yeah maybe we should try out some house
I will put them far away and crank them
to the maximum again t3 playing first
they're about 3/4 around volume
drink to you and I will turn the t-34
Mexico and you can hear it becomes quite
treble heavy the extreme as well
I'll open my eyes I'll check in disguise
you
you'll bring your suit
I think we've heard it loudness wise
that III cannot quite compete with the
JBL it just a 25 watt speaker while the
JBL has 40 but up to 75 80 percent I
think it sounds pretty decent from there
it becomes a little bit treble heavy but
still without distortion or any kind of
obvious processing or compression the
JBL struggles a little bit with treble
reproduction despite having twitter's
you really have to tilt it backwards to
get the best sound I don't know maybe
JBL had problems with tuning the speaker
because of this waterproof mesh here I
don't know so the audio Pro add-on t3 is
definitely one of the better sounding
speakers I've heard in its class it
should cost around 260 270 euros I guess
I don't know anything how it will be
available or when in Australia is a
known distributor it's also the one I
got it from called novice group so
thanks to novice club for providing me
the speaker for a test I think it's
really a kind of reference in this class
I think it sounds simply very HiFi very
very nice very rounded so anyone
interesting the speaker check it out
battery life is great I had it playing
the whole day and still all three dots
lit so yeah maybe not the best speaker
for outdoor use also because of the
edges but for home use and so on
every a great speaker I hope this could
give you a first idea about the t3 the
JBL is maybe not the best contender but
I think that t3 did really well to
compete with this bass-heavy monster
here thanks a lot for watching guys I
hope this was helpful and see you in the
next video bye-bye
hello guys today I would like to present
you hi guys today I would like to show
you that hello and welcome today I would
like to show you the audio Pro add-on
t3l hello and welcome today I would as
you can see the speaker is not very
large when put against the JBL extreme
you can see that gram super the add-on
t3 as you can see when put against
the JBL extreme this is not a very large
speaker yes a audio pro is a Swedish
company and they already have some
different Bluetooth then a don t 3 is
the first portable model unit model
here you can find the auxin auxiliary
input and yes nothing else to say I will
turn bolt on system
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
