balls microserver here subbing test
included in some future videos so here
have it sounds really amazing but only
when attached to a mini week's up so
this was the whole secret behind it but
not to something a little bit more
serious most of you hopefully already
know that most of my videos are based on
a binaural recording technique I settled
for this simply in order to be able to
capture the real sound always become
depending on the environment so either
indoors or outdoors they always sound
different also depending on the room why
by putting some simple recorder in front
of it pressing record you won't be able
to capture this interaction of the
speaker with its surrounding it won't
sound true neither one listen through a
speaker nor thread phone you will hear
something but it won't sound true not
like the speaker but with a binaural
recording you will have the impression
as us sitting inside the room the worldA
speaker together with me where I
recorded it of course you need
headphones for the best results by no
recordings don't sound great they don't
work through speakers I still get
comments I listen to this for my KRK
perk studio monitors but problem is that
when recording binaural e with my ears
you get some ear head resonance even my
body and when listening to a headphone
it compensates for this also is because
you get some crosstalk so a panel
recording really the left ear has to
hear the left signal and when listening
through speakers you get both both ears
get both channels which is of course
false so binaural recordings with our
headphones I emphasize it in every video
but still people tell me that they
listen to it for a flip three or four so
this is of course waste of time I take
this topic a little bit more seriously I
try to equalize my recordings for a
really lifelike result not simply
putting some microphones inside my ears
I created two different artificial heads
here is one with complete ear the
imaging is extreme you really get kind
of a 3d surround but the frequency
response is a little bit off also it
appears more diffuse than my pseudo
binaural one you can see it doesn't have
used it has this head
phones because my only putting
microphones on a sphere doesn't get it
gives a kind of hollow sound so it needs
some obstacle here and I think this
method gives the best results and I try
to equalize them it took me hours of
really tweaking my sound comparing the
sound of my recording to the original
sound and I used the Sennheiser HD 600
as reference because I think it's not
the best sounding one but it has a very
flat neutral sound and I'm aware that
every other yeah headphone sounds
different maybe remember my video from
last summer I think it was titled
headphone projects where I wanted to
know from you which headphone you used
to listen to my recordings and also if
we could settle for a particular cheap
model that everyone can afford that I
would equalize my recordings for this
one so that's really everyone he is what
was recorded I have several models here
cheap ones expensive ones like those
from ben mendelsohn
and yet it doesn't sound true when i
listen through these but a nice company
a thing from let's like Latvia Latvia I
don't know the English called sauna
works they try to equalize various types
of headphones for a really flat response
I also tried it with my Sennheiser HD
six hard you can select yet more than
hundred thirty models you can see here
from akj Apple they even have the ear
pods inside I tried it with my
Sennheiser there is some demo so when
you put them on press record without it
quite a lot
without equalization sounds like this so
when you enable it becomes a flat
response to some particular reference
curve which they maybe it's the Harmon
curve I'm not sure but the difference
with equalization and no equalization is
not that huge with the Sennheiser so I
already obviously selected a headphone
thanks to my friends who
suggested them to me literally gives
this flat response but for example I
would stop this noise here if we take
some yeah or these let's call I think
these are highly regarded you can see it
needs a little more compensation the
Sennheiser only needed compensation for
bass and a little bit of lower treble
but we have some really highly regarded
ones like the biodynamic I had this DP
770 you can see there is lots of you
have to compensate for bass also
photorealism said lots of treble boost
and this inspired me against being this
noise here this inspired me to look for
a headphone again and it's our famous
super Lux HD 681 they have it included I
listened to it equalized with their
method comparing it to the Sennheiser's
and it's pretty close I was really I was
surprised how close they are it's not a
sennheiser HD c salad but the tonality
is really close to neutral compared to
an unequal eyes one this is the Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen to play age for which cause I
think $300 or something it sounds
completely overblown with bass also
treble meets are somehow different but
this one soundly resembles the sound of
the HD six hammered so together let me
see
I hope my camera is still recording so
together with my friend I tried to to
taste a little bit on sauna works to
come up with an equalizing for this
headphone model here the super Lux HD
681 and sana works costs I think $100 or
$79 so probably most of you won't be
able to afford it but we tried to get a
similar sound out with with some
parametric equalizers based on the yep
equalizer a pole and oh I think it's
called like this we can have a look at
the side of from them
it's a free app and you simply download
our equalization I created an
equalization to get my friend for the
super Lux already the version two
because I was not satisfied with the
equalization from sauna works I tried to
bring it a little bit closer to the HD
600 also have one for the Sennheiser HD
600 so for all those who already
listened to my recordings with the HD
600 you are well off but still I would
rather suggest you to take this
equalization its smoothness out travel a
little bit gives you this base which is
missing from the HTC sonnet it rolls off
quite quite early with bass and also a
phone for the audio technica ath 50x we
tried to make it as close as possible to
the sauna works equalizing and i think
what i managed to help my friend for the
super luxe is really great so when i
listen to the recordings full of super
Lux together with this equalizing here
it sounds just like yeah like the real
sound of course it's not hundred percent
I'm still tweaking my equalizing because
by putting some get some microphones
into your ears and recording you won't
get the real sound so there are many
binaural recordings on YouTube from
other youtubers but you can be sure that
they sound off is it no it's not this
the real sound what I really try to give
you a kind of reference and the
reference in this case is the HD 600 or
the super Lux together with this
equalization so you can find the
download download link for my
equalization in the video description
for all three for the sennheiser HD 600
for the super Lux HD 681 and for the
audio technica you need to install this
equalizer app or I'm sure many of you
already know this then you simply go add
a new control include you include your
load my equalizer here which one is it
let's take the version one it was not
that perfect and when I get into this
you have all parametric I think I used
16 or 15 15 different peaking filters
and you can see the result I will add a
little bit of gain so that you can see
better so there's lots of lots of stuff
going on the basis reduce slightly then
the travel is completely off with the
see epilogue a super super luxe super
luxe but thanks to synchronization it
sounds really nearly as smooth as their
Sennheiser HD 600 maybe not perfect
let's have a look at the Sennheiser HD
600 accusation I also will add a little
bit of gain so that you see it better
you can see lots of bass boost because
the Sennheiser HD scale is a little bit
thin but here is not much only here at
20 kilohertz a little bit of boost
you won't hear it anyhow but here there
is not much some to 3 DB maximum so
already the HDS example is a great
reference but together with this with
this EQ curve here we get it in closer
to a kind of reference so I mean what I
can offer you is this equalization which
is for free from equalizer Ipoh and as
this speaker currently costs to 20 euros
I ordered five of them and I would like
to give away again to those who really
take this topic seriously who don't who
are not here for ya stupid comment
trolling around but who really want to
listen to the speaker how it sounds in
reality I redo my my best to bring it as
close as possible I'm sitting here often
until 2 or 3 o'clock
listening to speakers comparing to my
recording tweaking some sliders it's
it's really it's a dreary task and from
some certain point on I cannot say
anymore is this one better than the
previous one or not but I really try my
best and I want to offer you the very
best quality here on YouTube yeah I
invest lots of time so the the
headphones are currently not available
they will arrive maybe in mid-april and
I would like to give it away to five
because I could only order five Amazon
didn't let me to order more I would like
to give to give them away to five of you
I don't know write some comment why you
would like one
because you cannot afford one but it
must be someone I don't want to pick
some random guy he will I don't know
throw them away or something I already
want someone who maybe doesn't have the
chance to get them or because they are
too expensive I saw an Amazon calm
I think they cost around $30 so it's
really not expensive but I can ensure
you these headphones come in in stock
with the stock hearing they sound
horrible way too much treble you can see
how much there has to be reduced here we
are yeah more than 10 DB and they have
some bands it's not only some treble
reduction overall but there are some
narrow bands that have to be reduced or
boosted in order to bring it closer I'm
quite impressed what sauna Works has
achieved so far they are they have 130
models they can even equalize your
particular headphone you can send it to
them and they will give you a profile
with a flat response of course if you
can afford sauna works do it with their
software I would suggest to buy it and
pick one of their headphones which is
already included they have lots of them
like here for example let me see there
is a list somewhere yeah 138 supported
headphone models III AAA no idea a kg j
a cocky Austrian company I think it was
bought by Hammond meanwhile Samsung we
have audio technica lots of stuff
Mendelson h4 is coming soon so i hope
this one will be really included I am
really curious yes some bose speakers
Gretl gradle cause - the - ones i tried
it they need so much equalization to
bring them for flat response horrible I
don't know why they call themselves -
man it's far from high five high five
man - and high for me so yeah this is
the only thing I can offer you five of
these headphones - well my equalization
so that you really get more or less the
same sound that I'm recording or that
I'm hearing from my recordings
super-luxe is not a great headphone but
together this equalization and quite
impressed sometimes
I forgot that I'm listening with this
and then hey I should have listened to
their Sennheiser but the results are
really closed so it's quite impressive
and I yeah and I think we achieved some
goal for all the others who can afford
it
yeah by the super Lux HD 681 not the
there is 181 B because it needs a
different equalization or I have another
one here then 6:162 Evo also different
and I mean account equalized I don't
have the technical skills to equalize
every headphone like sona works thus so
if you can afford by sana works
otherwise by this headphone five of you
will get it for free I will pick five of
you I don't know depending on a comment
kind of what your argument is why you
want them or whatever but I really want
I mean I take this topic really
seriously I'm yeah and maybe some stupid
guy who is recording speakers at home
but at least I'm trying to make it as
real lifelike as possible and and it
took nearly two hours to get such
results also the head
I took different approaches how I could
bring it because when I wear the
headphones it's different
you hear my voice much louder than in
reality because the microphones are here
so much close of the mouth but with a
esthetic recording method where the head
or where you are standing beside me you
get a much more realistic sense of
loudness so you you can approach the
loudness of my voice and then you also
hear how loud the speaker's play this is
important because the human ear is far
from flat so if you listen to loud it
will become too bass-heavy while when
you listen with a too soft volume you
will lose bass
so therefore yeah I'm still
experimenting and I hope you appreciate
this but I'm simply trying to do my best
yeah independent of which speakers
recording I just want to make it as
lifelike as possible and I already put a
lot of effort into this maybe it's not
visible maybe it's not here able but
I had a listen to some YouTube some
other YouTube channels and sometimes I
couldn't really hear any difference from
two speakers which is sound completely
different I know them because I have
them at home and I know how they sound
and then I listened to their recordings
and a sample totally equal they don't
even look at the gain so when the
speaker becomes loud the gain goes down
so the the output there the end result
is always the same loudness and and he's
reading oh look how loud but it still
the same loudness as it was before so I
really I mean I don't want to brace
myself or something but rather I'm some
kind of audio engineer but I have some
slight musical background so I I have
some musical year and I think I I know
when I'm satisfied with something or not
and I'm still not satisfied with my
results I would like to improve of
course I cannot afford the most
expensive microphones which cost five
six thousand dollars so I try to do it
in a modest way with modest equipment
but get as good results as possible
therefore I'm quite impressed what's
achievable with this super Lux HD 681
with some simple equalization if you
don't have equalizer a pole on on your
Mac I think it's not available on Mac OS
you can you see all the parametric you
simply take the values and put it into
some other parametric equalizer app
although I'm not quite sure if the Q
factors are equal because my friend who
gave me some suggestions how to attune
this he made it in another app I tried
to take his values and the result was
different so then I tweaked the Q
factors the gain values and so on in
order to get it can the same result so
not all despite yet the videos being
here I think all work a little bit
differently so if you use equalizer
Epple with my equalization you should
get really pretty close results to what
I'm hearing in reality yet because I was
sitting there I was recording I was
comparing the recording Toto the real so
I can say yeah it is
I'm on a certain level where I really
can say yeah I'm hearing this what I'm
hearing for my recording so it is if I
wouldn't at this level
I wouldn't post any videos I would
simply yeah it doesn't make sense
I want to reach a certain level so that
I can be satisfied with myself so that I
can say okay I captured the reality I
captured how the sound is of course you
need some reference which in this case
is the Aichi 600 also equalized with
this equalizer April or the Sona works
with their equalizing all in this case a
very cheap head from the super luxe HD
681 so again five of you simply write a
comment why why you would like to get it
or why you need it by all means I have
some people who comment every video I
know it but I really want to give it to
someone who who deserves it who who has
the need of this because he takes this
seriously who watches all my videos who
doesn't Buddhist I don't know because
what is he interested and still I'm very
flattered that there are people who
watch my videos which are boring half an
hour listening to music but they still
watch everything and they can even talk
about details inside the video which I
forgot so I really appreciate this and
I'm fascinated that I have some fair
friends let's gonna Nugget of course
also some haters but yeah this is
currently the only thing I can give back
to you because I want you to hear the
same what I was hearing I tried some
headphones I don't know this this I have
one here from TechStars sounds quite
nice but when I listen to my recordings
it's something completely different so
yeah not sure if something else to say
it's becoming already quite long I hope
you like this yeah and as soon as the
headphones will arrive of course I will
keep one for me but five will be ordered
should arrive mid-april and as soon as
they arrived I will look for the
comments here and then pick five of you
which I think yeah you deserve them
in a particular way you deserve them
because I don't know you cannot afford
them or because you you are one of these
who watch all my videos every time and
until the end and you really take this
seriously what I'm doing I'm something
sometimes I have the impression
what the am I doing here recording
some stupid speakers why should someone
watch this but it's not the speaker it's
also the I think my my intention behind
all this is to be able to capture the
reality I want to capture the real sound
how it is in reality
yeah like a painter what is trying to
you know to capture the reality if it's
a naturalistic painter so I am trying to
capture really the natural audio in such
a way that it represents the reality
maybe it's some maybe I mean maniac or
something I was always fascinated by
binaural recordings the first time the
very first recording maybe you notice
with the matches someone going around
and I really got some up and down
localization I'm not quite sure if it's
if it was recorded with an artificial
head or if it's some processed because
someone told me it is it's an artificial
recording processed so that it sounds up
and down I'm not sure I could I couldn't
get such results but at least I try to
do the frequency response which the
speaker gives you capture inside my
recordings this is my mic oh yeah
yeah nothing else to say again thanks a
lot to all those who still donate lately
there was not that much but from time to
time I get some donations so thanks a
lot to those it helps me of course of
course I had to spend money to buy them
but I want you to get at least results
which are close to this what I'm hearing
I hope I'm not repeating myself yeah the
Bose Microsoft offer here it's not Nokia
it's the original designer is from NXT
as a brand from Philips they invented it
and then I think it was licensed by by a
Nokia but the the original one is from
Philips so it was called I think
butterfly 10 years ago or 15 years ago
and yet I was quite quite impressed how
well it sounded - well at the mini weeks
up even my my son was impressed he
played with them the whole day and it
was quite funny because I left it on the
table the subwoofer was below the table
like in the April April Fool's video my
wife came in she looked at the speaker
because she couldn't see the sofa she
was taken as well so the video is not
fake
they are playing together the subwoofer
is just standing below the table so yeah
don't want to bore you thanks a lot for
watching and see you then mid April end
of April when April April April April
Rehan quite nervous sorry as soon as the
camera runs I need at least five six
takes in order to get in into this and
then my head is burning already yet but
as soon as this arrived I will pick five
of you and you will get them yeah I will
ship them worldwide so also quite a bit
of cost for me I know many complain why
don't you do any giveaways I will I have
lots of stuff to give away but there
must be some occasion for this I also
know some other channels we have which
have millions of subscribers I know
there is a German guy because one or two
million and he gives away some t-shirts
with his name or I don't know so I don't
get lots of money with YouTube it's a
little bit so that I can survive they
can buy some new stuff some speakers and
so on but it doesn't allow me to to buy
some I don't know some speaker for a
thousand dollars and then give it away
to you if I was rich I would definitely
do this simply as a thank you but
currently I cannot but don't worry there
will be more giveaways
I have some speakers prepared which are
not cheap which I like a lot but I would
like to give them away simply needs to
be some occasion so stay tuned and now
Emily finished otherwise my half-hour
recording limit will be will be limited
normally will be passed will be over
passed I don't know
so thanks for watching good night
because yeah it's night it's midnight
and see you the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
