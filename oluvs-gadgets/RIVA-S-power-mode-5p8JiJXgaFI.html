against their bosonic me and some other
speakers but now I noticed that some
people start complaining that the
reverse is not loud enough they claimed
it it doesn't even reach the maximum
volume of the Bose Soundlink mini which
is not quite true therefore please let
me clear this up usually the river is in
some kind of economy modes which is
optimized for maximum battery run time
the lower the battery gets the lower the
maximum volume drops as well but it has
also an own power mode included this
boosts volume slightly and keeps volume
constant all the time I thought I would
like to demonstrate you the difference
between these two modes also especially
compared against the Bose Soundlink mini
as always I will be using binaural
microphones than the head cam to give
you a kind of first-person view so
please put up your headphones and we
will check this out so now how to
activate this power mode either directly
through a speaker by keeping bluetooth
and mute button pressed for some seconds
this double beep shows you that it's in
power mode now do the same again and it
will jump back into economy mode yeah
or you can also do it through the app
you can see my battery is already at 64%
which means it won't be able to reach
its maximum volume anymore but pressing
the center button here brings you into
power mode of course I would like to
show you the difference in loudest
between both also using the Bose
Soundlink mini 2 as reference I will
start playing some tracks from soul
persona
these are usually very hot mastering
therefore most smallest because start
struggling a little bit I'm starting
with the river as first still in economy
mode and then I will switch over to the
Bose Soundlink mini to later on I will
crank both to maximum and to hopefully
hear some difference
ya already know the difference
countess obvious very very simply much
more refined so I start cranking them
for maximum lower volume so let's
activate
let's try another trick yes is not like
loving more and sound simply horrible
yeah the boss sounds a bit as if it was
broken as if it couldn't get any bread
let's try some kind of house track and
with the river is now playing in power
mode
both are mixing as you can see I was
wish to the dance again doesn't go any
louder you can also hear that thanks to
the site drivers you get a much better
sound dispersion to the sides while the
poles
yes arms only good exactly on access
getting even when I turn off power mode
it will be still louder or at least it
will still sound much better the boss
again I will activate Auto mode again
and let's try another
track the soundest version of opposes
unacceptable for a portable speaker
I'm not even mentioning their sound
a joke
they're calling the methods of
yeah I think the difference is more than
obvious
yeah I think it was pretty obvious that
the reverse make that both something
maybe some pretty ridiculous especially
at maximum volume regardless it played
in economy or in power mode it still
maintains the same sound quality which
means no dynamic compression no
distortion but simply pure sound like it
was reported originally in case you
cannot enable power mode yet please
contact River support but all current
units should already have this included
yet I mean the river is despite not
being the cheapest pick around is
definitely worth it if you don't have
one yet yet please wait until my River s
giveaway next line or simply black one
if you have some money next I hope this
short video could help to clear up this
confusion around loudness and so on I
hope it was helpful see you in the next
one and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
