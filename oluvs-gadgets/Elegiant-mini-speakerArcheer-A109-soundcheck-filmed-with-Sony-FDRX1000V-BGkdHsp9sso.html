the best portable mini speaker I came
across this one from LA giant it's
available on Amazon for sixteen dollars
and it comes in different colors as you
can see here and finally the same
speaker is also offered by Archaea as a
109 also for sixteen dollars and both
claimed it to be completely waterproof
it says here up to three feet for 30
minutes and I thought we will check it
out how it sounds and so on
let's look at the packaging first here
it also says dtb 660 waterproof speakers
inside there is charging wire and some
carabiner so that you can let it hang
somewhere and this is the first time I
am recording a video with two cameras at
the same time
one is the yi4 K which is mounted on a
gimbal because the built-in image
stabilization is really horrible the
other one is my usual Sonic cam which
also has built-in stabilization that
works quite well but the sony doesn't
have lens distortion correction so it
has this typical fisheye effect which
I'm trying to correct slightly in
post-processing but I cannot remove it
completely because otherwise it will
become a pincushion in the center while
the edges will become straight so that's
please tell me afterwards which which
one you prefer if the 4k from y:i has
also great image quality I'm not quite
sure which one is really better also the
gimbal adds a slight high-pitched tone
maybe you can hear it if I'm if I remain
silent
usually this tone is not available when
I'm not filming without in bells all for
me without gimbal would be probably
better but I'm not sure if the sony with
this fish is really good enough for you
as always i'm using binaural microphones
so we should listen with headphones
let's turn it on power on teri pretty
loud voice prompt and yeah it has a main
driver in the passive radiator at at the
top are some controls and
yeah behind the Philip is the charging
port so this protects it probably from
water and yeah I thought we'll compare
it against the ankus ant colony know
that we heard just recently as I think
this is a kind of reference in this
class I mean it doesn't sound
particularly great but it sounds decent
enough to be better than most others
therefore let's see how these two
compare I'm not quite sure how to place
it because when placed like that in a
more homely directional way we will
cover the PC free data so yeah let's
have a listen I will start playing with
the with this elegant speaker and some
kind of dense house trick the anchor
yeah and I think you can hear that it
sounds quite a bit more full-bodied
richer awesome nice a treble and a giant
again sounds a bit like a bad mp3 file
maybe we could also place it like that
but doesn't seem as if covering the
discreet did any harm yet this
definitely sounds a bit richer the
anchor may be no effect
it doesn't seem to make any difference
yes can't really compete lady
heartwright and I will increase volume
and maximum to stay and a giant snow
anchor as well gets louder and sounds
fuller
yes there's no chance the anchor is
slightly more expensive I think it calls
for 22 or 24 dollars in Europe both
costs the same I think 19 euros but we
could try it maybe against this Omega we
also heard before
this calls for 15 I think so they are
quite comparable and yeah it should
connect and maybe let's try another
track again starting with this le giant
they also sounds rich I would say a very
mid acute
maybe let's turn balls or maximum the
Omega has some sliced interference
issues with locals because yes probably
the camera the life view and so on they
all make a strategy of slightly I don't
know Jake needs closer distance of your
blink
Omega doesn't sound great but it's
definitely more powerful so hmm I mean
it's nice that you can really put it
into water give it to your son and he
will play with it but the sound is quite
questionable not really great not better
than all the others mmm
so for serious music listening I
wouldn't recommend it but you know its
present why not
yeah hope this could give you an idea
about the a giant my favorite with this
form-factor size and so on is I think
the anchor sound corny no although not
really serious sounding it sounds let's
say exact
acceptable compared to the others it has
a nice rich as sound and those also nice
treble without the strange fish I don't
know so if you don't mind any water
protection I would go for the anchor
yeah I hope I can still find something
better
who knows yeah please give me some
suggestions if you have heard a speaker
which is as small as the anchor but
sounds better so I will try this one out
but until then the anchor remains my
kind of reference for all these small
ones it's not the loudest the Omega is
slightly louder but it sounds worse the
anchor has this nice
the base slight hint of deeper bass
which is completely missing from the
others so the anchor will be headed to
the database the Omega is already added
with resonating positioning and normal
one I will leave this one off because it
doesn't make sense it sounds horrible so
yeah thanks a lot for watching and yeah
we will see us in the next video have a
nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
