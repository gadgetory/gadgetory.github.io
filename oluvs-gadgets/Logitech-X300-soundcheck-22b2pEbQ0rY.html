about the Logitech X 300 according to
Maya cata a pretty decent speaker and
one of the best low budget solutions
well according to them I only heard it
once in a store and was not that
impressed at all but then I thought yeah
I should give it another try
I ordered it and it arrived some minutes
ago here you see the packaging I unboxed
it immediately so here it says five
hours battery life which is of course
not that great but you have uniquely
angled drivers provide provide range
sound connect your smartphone or tablet
or a mobile theater experience you see
this graphics with sound emitting to the
sides and everything so well in theory
looks pretty decent but let's have a
listen how it sounds in reality first a
look at a measurement well
pretty balanced but nothing to write
home about no real bass and well but as
always I'm using binaural microphones so
if you listen with headphones you should
get a realistic impression of the sound
and I will start with a smooth jazz
track so please have a listen here I
mean nothing special I don't hear any
theater sound here it sounds a bit
monotone me
so which speaker could we compare it to
this is also
or a low-budget solution I already saw
it
in British stores for 20 pounds so quite
cheap so let's listen how this GDK a 25
sounds compared I think the difference
is obviously TDK just sounds better at a
treble database also put a stereo
separation to decay again so I don't
think this Logitech is dead great I mean
it's decent but the prices vary between
I think 40 dollars up to even $80 for 80
dollars you can get much better speakers
let listen to another track
and also very flat sound TDK it sounds
just larger
yeah the more in Iraq and there is
already some strange processing some
dynamics compression going on here a TDK
I will increase volume slightly under
Logitech as well and I think it becomes
better the higher you turn it
but still that became sounds more mature
let's try something else
this sounds simply bigger and better
something else you could hear the volume
drop again a TK maybe let's increase
volume maximum to see how loud both can
claim this is the logitech now and I'm
increasing volume yeah but it remains
pretty punchy even at maximum not a CD k
yet maximum they become comparable let's
try another fact of silver TDK X a bit
more punch loudness is similar but it's
in the sounds better
yes but I cannot hear anything of this
theater sound here
TK this one sounds browser somehow but
it appears also slightly softer than the
Logitech so at high levels or let's say
maximum it's not really that bad yeah
but really nothing special I mean
depends on how much you pay for it but I
wouldn't pay more than $30 for this so
yeah a pretty average speaker really
nothing special far not best or I know
how why ikata claims I mean I don't
trust the ratings anyhow because they
also rated the mini boom as one of the
best and the UE boom and mega boom I
mean every Logitech and you if speaker
is best according to them which simply
boggles I mean this is not true so here
we have it the Logitech X 300 use I mean
descent if you can get it for 20 $30
maybe but if you can get the GDK for the
same price I would definitely go for
this size Y is not much difference
this one is flatter and and slimmer this
one is a bit more blown up but yet
nothing really special to tell it with a
little bit of a disappointment
yeah funny design here so yeah I hope
this was helpful for those who wanted to
hear the Logitech X 300 yeah you have it
here nothing special but not really bad
either I mean it doesn't have any flaws
you could see the frequency response was
pretty flat but yeah it sounds too flat
to tell the truth
thanks a lot for watching I hope this
was helpful and we will see us in the
next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
