extreme against the new JBL charged reef
so here you are but I wouldn't say that
both are meant to compete but rather to
complement each other the JBL
charge-free is much smaller and lighter
so it's really a nice speaker to be
taking with you
all the time while I would rather take
the JBL extreme when I know that I meet
together with some friends and want to
play some party tunes or something but
for Indo use sometimes it's not the best
speaker because of this heavy bass boost
it already starts struggling slightly
above our volume with quite a bit of
distortion while the JBL charge 3 is a
much more balanced speaker also quite a
nice deep sound but simply not as
boosted therefore I would like to
demonstrate you how both sound as always
i'm of course using high quality
binaural microphones so you should
listen with headphones to hear the real
sound of them i will start with the
first song from soul persona starting
with the JBL charge 3 first volume is
set to slightly above half for both so
let's have a listen
it's already here that base from the
stock slightly with their why this
sounds smoother without this piece this
final track also quite a bass heavy
recording but let's charge with us
really nicely here the extreme always
takes a bit of time
pop into scrapes lightly please how
clean the base remains here extreme yes
simply because of too much boost if the
song is already boosted and you add some
other boost yeah this is the result
extreme
you can hear that the strong bass and
treble tend to drown out the need
slightly so it appears more covered than
the charge three despite having
Twitter's and to tell the truth I
personally prefer the more balanced
approach of their to charge free for
everyday use of course the extreme again
you can all hear bass and hi-hat not
attract some acoustic
j.c.bose Imola
I mean for its size the charge-free is
really an impressive speaker not simply
different maybe some nice rock
very nice needs quite a bit more going
here
it's simply natural
extreme again
yet this sounds definitely nicer that's
why this extreme is too much base with
this kind of recording know it sounds
somehow everything
I will put them far away and let's
listen them now I can start increasing
volume slightly
it's much more things it's still hard
for maximum range hot mix the still
counts modulus let's find out a track
the track is playing two notches below
maximum the extreme is well all five
notches below maximum it appears more
punchy but also quite a bit harsh
I will increase the volume for mixing
another class for you not that much
difference in them and I will try
matching the extreme to this then you
get too much more volunteer around 3 or
not jacilla maximum
but it sounds great somehow hey
in the chops replace at maximum
by the extremists rather match to this I
wouldn't say that it sounds better
faintly different
another song also savasana
if you get some nice punch of course
much less than with the extreme let's
try this yeah this punch is different
I've increased the extreme automation
why does it's louder confidence brain
maybe
those are very loud noise
extreme poverty starvation
Oh plug it a little bit maybe again
another crack oh you know at the
beginnig and saw my play list is over
yeah
you've heard it loudness wise no chance
against the extreme but I wouldn't say
that the extreme sounds great at maximum
there is some harshness and the strong
bass boost makes it well appear a bit I
don't know hollow or something I really
like the charge 3 despite not being as
loud and as boo me yeah it's much closer
to a high 5 speaker is already mentioned
and for anyone who always thought yeah
this has too much bass you should try
the charge 3 as this still has all the
bass but simply not as boosted yeah I
hope this was it I hope it was helpful
for you as the first video
not sure if we will do any more
interesting would be to charge three
against one extreme but currently I only
have one and I don't think that loudness
wise - could still compete with one
extreme one would be still louder but
you've heard it this harshness there is
some sheesh at higher levels that I
don't quite like so maybe the tool
charge 3 could be even better I mean I'm
not even talking about stereo separation
and so on
so thanks for everyone who watches this
and I really hope this was helpful we
will see us in the next video until then
have a nice time at bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
