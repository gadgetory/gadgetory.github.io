and maybe Ness the idea I would like to
know if we can annoy the neighborhood
with a little bit of loud music yeah
that's pretty nasty I know but some days
ago an idiot played music until four
o'clock in the morning I could hardly
find any sleep and it was really loud I
mean you could hear the bass pounding
and the nearest houses are maybe 300 200
meters away so I was wondering what kind
of hi-fi system he was using as you can
see behind me is the IVA XS 9 and I will
be using this for my test I will set it
up here at the window so that the house
acts as a kind of reflecting wall that
projects the sound more towards the
village the street is behind the trees
below I think it's about 30-40 meters I
will go there and we will hear if the
IVA can still be heard from there as an
ultimate test I will also go over there
I think this is about 500-600 meters and
we'll have a listen if the IVA still
manages to be heard from that distance
as you can see I'm already wearing my
binaural microphones and I will keep the
gain of my recorder the same throughout
the whole recording so if you take the
voice the loudness of my voice as a
rough reference you should also be able
to judge the loudness of the speakers
how it sounds from 500 600 meters away I
will adjust the equalize a little bit at
some notches base some notches treble to
make the sound even more powerful
of course as I won't have any Bluetooth
connection from 600 meters I will call
my wife and she will start playing some
music I prepared two tracks one dance
track from nocopyrightsounds which is
really a very powerful loud mastering
and a rock track from the YouTube audio
library which I also added a little bit
of compression to really make it pump
let's crank the speaker to the maximum
and let's go
I'm at the street now the speaker is
somewhere 4050 metres away behind the
trees I will call my wife and she shall
play some music for us
hello let's go
yeah that's a bit annoying if you stand
here
these are maybe 50 meters or something
now the rock record
now let's go even far away 200 meters
behind me and have a listen from there
I'm about 200 meters away my house is
right behind me I will call my wife
again and we will do the same test again
let's go
well it's still pretty loud man
I think at night at 4 o'clock this will
annoy the whole village here
200 meters away
somewhere there behind the trees
sorry I'm still a little bit out of
breath but as you can see the whole
village is below us and this is our
house I will call my wife again and we
will do the last ultimate test let's go
you can steer still hear it although
quite muted
keep in mind the distance
the rock track is in more annoying
Wow a portable speaker that you can
still hear from 500 600 meters away
that's pretty impressive I mean the IVA
XS 9 seems to be the perfect machine to
annoy either the neighbors or even the
whole village or take it to the beach
make some party and you will attract all
the wayon even if you are not the
prettiest just like me well okay I hope
this was helpful
I hope this could give you a slight idea
about the qualities of the IVA we will
see us after my holidays have a nice
time and bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
