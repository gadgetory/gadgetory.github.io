some low-budget stuff here starting from
13 dollars up to 35 $60 I'm always in
search of some really nice sounding
low-budget speakers but most of them
sound rather creepy despite getting some
really raving reviews on Amazon
therefore I would like to show you how
this sound how this compare and what you
can expect from them as always I'm using
binaural microphones for recording so
please listen with headphones and the
first time I'm trying to use my iPhone
as head cam
well the lens is not as wide angled but
I think it has a pretty nice Image
Stabilizer building so the image won't
be a shaky as usual I hope the image
well the frame is okay I cannot judge it
as always so yeah please forgive me if
not every speaker is visible I will be
using one song from soul persona and
switch flow through all these Pickers so
we can compare how they sound and let's
start with the cheapest one this is the
Isle of odd mini let's turn it on when
looking at Amazon ah it's got really
yeah nice reviews as you can see it cost
$13 so it's the cheapest one and I think
it's one of the worst soundings because
I've ever heard let's have a listen
here this is simply horrible maybe for
$13 you cannot expect more but
I wouldn't like to listen with this
I have another speaker here this I found
this in a local store for I think also
14 15 euros and I think they have their
they share the same design one passive
radiator and one driver so they are
actually mono but I think this one
despite being smaller sounds even better
let's have a listen again this is the I
love
and this is the other one I will turn it
slightly louder and I think it sounds
better still pretty crappy you can hit
it vibrate so it will need some kind of
pillow
let's Turnbull to maximum
you
now let's try the next one this is from
EC technology called x7 at least this is
written in the rooted list also some
nice reviews cost $19 so let's see how
this sounds
I am switching over to this no-name PQ
speaker
it's definitely more balanced a fuller
sound
Deborah let's turn ball for maximum
you can also hear vibrations and that
one also miss some pillow yes next one
is the arrow spark a s200 it goes for
$35 um and also some nice reviews and I
think it's a decent speaker usually
there is some carabiner mounted but I
took it off because it's it always
rattled against the base it also has its
D card playback and so on
and it reminds me a little bit of the UE
mini boom but simply sounding better and
being much cheaper I will start with the
with this x7 first and then we will have
a listen to the Aris back this is
maximum volume by the way
it also makes some pillow you can see it
rotates on its own but I think you can
hear the air sparks sounds more balanced
I'll turn it to make some as well
next in this list we have the gem rewind
this cost $38 but you can see the list
price is 99 well funny thing about the
speaker is that it looks a bit like an
old analog cassette yeah start to
passive radiators at the back so let's
have a listen how this one sounds it
seemed more expensive than the era spark
there is Park is also water resistant
waterproof it's pretty racked so let's
see how they compare I'm starting with
the gem rewind first please already
close to maximum volume
I think you definitely need some pillow
as well
it's not bad but you can hear the bass
from already drawn slightly I will turn
both to maximum yeah this is nice
yeah and last but not least the anchor
premium stereo bluetooth 4.1 speaker a
31:43 with 20 watts output this costs
$60 and has also some nice reviews we've
already heard it so it can compete quite
well with the Bose so it depends if you
are willing to pay nearly double the
price compared to the era spark I'm
starting with the anchor first and then
I will switch over to the era spark
let's have a listen
the 8-ounce clearer this morning problem
of the anchor
but at the same time I think you can
hear that the anchor simply sounds much
more serious much more full-bodied
this still reminds a cheap speaker I
will come both to maximum
you
so what did we learn from this well I
think for 2030 dollars you really cannot
expect anything decent at least nothing
I found did really satisfy my needs you
will probably have to pay $60 to get
some well what I would call more serious
sound the era's puck is a pretty decent
speaker but it still sounds like all
these cheap
well junkie oh you can get it still one
of the better ones but nothing to write
home about so if you have other
suggestions for speakers which really
shine let's say 30 40 dollars but simply
outperform all the others please let me
know and I would willingly like to test
them but I really haven't found anything
that will load me in any in any way none
of these I mean this is really one of
the worst I've ever had
despite you you've seen it it has 4.5
stars on Amazon I don't know I mean
maybe because it's so cheap but 13
dollars
yeah so I hope this was helpful and yeah
please write in the comments if you know
some others because some low budgets
because that's really really sound
decent with some decent base and so on I
really want a if there is out if there
is something out I'm not sure maybe we
we have some underdogs so thanks for
watching and see you then bye-bye
