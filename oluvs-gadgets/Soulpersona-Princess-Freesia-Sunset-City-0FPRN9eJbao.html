general but music from soul persona in
Princes future in particular also about
their new upcoming album called sunset
city where they have started a pledge
campaign on pledge music
they have nearly reached the goal with
91% but I think with a little bit of
your help they can which it investor or
exhibit so if you like soulful funky
disco music check them out you can find
the link in the description of my video
I really love their music I also think
that mastering are great revealing
differences between speakers quite well
once a friend of mine came up with the
slogan sole persona
let a speaker shine or break which is
indeed true because is playing a track
like analog to a crappy speaker you can
immediately hear that it cannot handle
it while play to a great system you can
hear that it sounds great still I'm
getting cupid comment like why do you
play so music well I don't think
this is music just on the contrary
I grew up with legends and musicians
like Harry Hancock Chick Corea or no
Quincy Jones George Duke yet one of my
favorites but unfortunately he died some
years ago so these are real legends real
musicians Michael Jackson the composer
behind many of his tracks
Rob Templeton is a genius you cannot say
that the sheet music and soul persona
somehow for myself takes this music from
the 70s and 80s and puts them to to now
and yeah
every commenter who says the sheet music
because he's just used to trap or no
electro yeah please hold yourself a bit
back because I think I know a little bit
what great music is it mean it's maybe
not not your style in this non-lethal
acid ac/dc or hard rock heavy metal but
I grew up with this music soul for
myself this is of course great yeah if
you like this music as well check the
pledge campaign if your pledge you will
get access to some unreleased tracks
some remixes also great videos on
household us on our performs and
composes also some planning videos on
your nurse wrinkles which are putting
around is really crazy
yeah and now for the music levels I will
play an unreleased track which won't
find its way on to the upcoming album
you can also download it if you pledge
in original wav format so if cost you
some dollars or if you have enough money
you can pledge thousand dollars and let
you compose your own track from soul
persona in princess region I'm already
eagerly waiting for a new album which
will be released in a few months so the
tej campaign still goes for 56 55 days
and still also getting questions what
quiz which this musician what is so
persona yet so persona and princess
region really great musicians and thank
to them for this great music my channel
would definitely be not the same without
their music so now a nice new track in
full-length have a nice time and enjoy
it's the hay balers to me tell it to me
give me your life buzzer like jaws
around my face he impresses in the okay
Oh didn't see before the postman deliver
it to me you assess me as I try to make
a sense out making my fans person never
be good to me and who baby names always
get the best of me some tryna be good to
speak you but I'm gonna be good to me so
when I'm feeling like it's gotta be me
today just turning your basket and now I
got a bigger mouth camera should be
another thing every walk away drive your
waist up
do you baby never fit on my love.we you
sustained a fire free day cuz you never
give up your nothing that'll never be
real pleased if you take and you cannot
get back at anyone want to be
I know you think it's a late thank you
it's okay I'm really not trying to hurt
your baby but another thing you walked
away
tried your chopsticks just a waste of
paper if I could speak up about time I
heard you play and now you're picturing
mistake three times by three and you can
now be easily we religious crying a mile
away and now I'm a stopper to you in a
place of is hopeful that we come today
I really wanna be Oh
Oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
