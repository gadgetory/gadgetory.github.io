review any further in yes and death pose
anymore still I have to standing here so
what the hell well some time ago I was
asked by two Chinese companies
simultaneously if I would like to review
their India's this is the ICO oh1
this deaths in Guardian seven heart
problem both quite popular among the
head-fake community you can also find
them on Amazon with really high ratings
I think mostly five stars but I was not
that convinced I hesitated told them I'm
not really interested they existed
anyhow asking me if I could just have a
listen give them some feedback don't
make any region so they sent them for
free
took some time to arrive from China
unfortunately both were held back by the
Austrian customs asking me for some
invoice so I sent them an original
invoice from the company with a lower
value is it's a free sample but they
didn't accept it they told me we found
this on the internet with $140 not
$20.00
so we need a genuine invoice that Odin
no please I don't want to hassle with
all this I didn't buy it I won't pay any
custom fees send it back the same was
the case for the single bro also asking
me for invoice what's this and I don't
know I told them no look I already had
problems with with this one I don't want
to accept this send it back after a week
the single arrived anyhow obviously the
company did some action I'm not sure
while I could tried it with another
shipping shipping company the first one
North was DHL the other one was TNT but
again the same we need some invoice we
need some video so I told them no please
let's stop this and really not
interested but they insisted that I get
it from the European distributor which
is in Denmark a shop called Javed gray
so after a day I had it it arrived
yesterday and as I have both now here I
thought you might be interested about my
personal opinion I'm not quite sure how
valid how representative my opinion is
but I mean these are in years would only
cost 140 hundred fifty dollars so a
little bit more expensive so I think
they should be at the particular level
so in looking at all those great reviews
from pro reviewers I think I should do
my own review and give you my opinion on
them first let's have a look at the Iko
Iko
whatever
I think this is a dual driver design
dynamic driver but I really don't care
when I when I make speaker reviews the
first thing people asking how many watts
hey who cares about the words of a
portable speaker it doesn't say anything
and one what speaker can be more
powerful than a 20 watt speaker it
doesn't so I really don't care how many
drivers the result should be what counts
so let's have a look inside packaging is
nothing unusual so it doesn't want to
hear quite nice inside is a carrying
pouch quite okay and it comes with two
different sets of tips here it says
vocal ear tips balanced ear tips we will
look later on or listen later on if they
really influence the sound yet they do
but I couldn't say which one is better
then the itself is really nice it has
this dented look as if it was hammered
or something on cables of course
slappable I think is a standard
connector not CC MX some some other tool
pin whatever so let me see this is the
right one you see it on the color or so
there is some imprint l and r and what I
like about them they they stay really
nicely inside the year I had no problems
at all perfect fit really with both lips
with both the these are the balance tips
and also with the vocal ones you also
have this wire belt to wire it together
so really really nice the SIM card on
the other hand has a quite unique look
reminds me of some old know some some
microphones from the 60s and all those
rock-and-roll microphones and also funny
the right one is black the left one the
right one is red the left one is black
and also the tips are two colored so you
see the left one has a black black part
here while the right one is red the
sweet touch button that also the same
connector
you see yeah I think you could even
sweat wires from the other one inside
you can tell a bit more pressures you
open this here so with this box some
Chinese dragon a leather faux leather
I'm not sure let me sniff yeah I think
it's really leather also some additional
tips some immanuel so I think this is it
looks really quite you can see also two
sets of tips but they are equal just
different sizes a problem I have with
the single is that it doesn't stay
inside my ear that well I'm not quite
sure why what the reason is because the
design is small s but there is some
difference you can see the the iCore is
somehow taper to the to the back here so
it stays better inside the year why this
one somehow tends to slip out again I
mean it's not that easy to get the seal
right I can feel how it slightly was
slowly slips out again and yeah nothing
else to say I'm not even sure if it's a
dual driver or triple driver or it's not
real was it just a single it's not
really written there but I don't care I
think the result is what counts and
before taking a look at some
measurements let's have a listen let's
start with the icon and let's hear what
influence the tips do first with the
balance tips then we will try the voice
tips and I thought let's compare it
against some other in here I would like
to throw in the sony image 1 again you
can find for 10 15 dollars but it is
slightly more that you can see it looks
horrible i sealed it if you seal the the
complete body here you will reduce base
so it it becomes really close to flat
sounding really really nice if if you're
interested I could do a video about the
modded image one compared to us
top-1 so that you hear the difference
but I will of course use this one as I
think it sounds more balanced overall
for those complaining about slow bass
now as it sees it sounds really amazing
I prefer it again over most other in
years especially those expensive ones it
sounds really great
yeah you still have this this horrible
wire lead which is really stiff but the
pattern that the sound is really amazing
so we will hear the very beginning the
original track analog from so person in
princess region then the balance tips
then the voice tips in switching back
and forth and at the end for comparison
and as reference the sony image one and
at the very very end again the original
track so that you know how it should
sound in reality so let's have a listen
I think you'd hear that tips definitely
make some difference but I couldn't say
which one sounds better because both
were really not that great especially
compared against their modded Sony mhm
one I think the balance tips sound a
little smoother but overall I'm not that
impressed maybe let's have a look at
some measurements to see what's going on
this is uncompensated and you can see
the balance tips and hear the voice tips
so the biggest difference is that the
balance tips reduce the area above 5
kilohertz while boosting the area below
slightly so overall treble gets reduced
bass is small is the same if i overlay
the sony image 1 in black here you can
see that it measures completely
different less bass also not as boosted
in the 3 kilohertz region and all travel
is simply way soft and smooth over just
a single upper trail peak at around 14
15 kilohertz so and now let's compare
the icon or h1 with the balance tips
against the single e and 7 hard prom I
tried different tips but they didn't
influence the sound that much so let's
have a listen to this tour and at the
beginning and at the end you will always
hear the original track for reference so
let's have a listen
is it just a dream a baby inside my
fantasies come to me you are is my
thoughts I never stray from my part of
you
we can't
am i touching you I wanna feel
I think you'd hear both were really not
that great I mean keep in mind this is
just a recording but quite close to what
I hear in reality when listened to a
Sennheiser HD 600 with sonar works
profile maybe you get something else but
I hear them like that the sim got a n7
ha got this six kilohertz peak maybe yet
nice a base database but overall staying
very hard sounding so let's have a look
at some measurements of both here so
they echo with balance tips and the
single in red here and you can see base
is wavelet on the sim that also doesn't
have this boost in there for kilohertz
region but more boost at 6 kilo Hertz
and none of this 10 kilohertz peak from
the echo here but if I overlay the mod
it's only image 1 again here you can see
that bass is similar to the single but
doesn't have this strong boost at three
four five six key nodes so I am really
not that impressed with both I cannot
quite follow all those great reviews I
mean they are not horrible but it's not
an India that I would like to listen to
the ICO has way too much bass also quite
a harsh sound it's way too colored for
my taste I prefer a more neutral sound
with maybe some bass boost some treble
boost but none of these Peaks in between
so I'm sorry but I may be the only one
who contradicts all others and I already
got some criticism if you don't like the
ICO
you are the only one you contradict
every other reviewer yeah well I do but
I hear them like you've heard from the
recording it's not a sound that I would
like to listen to if you compare it to
the original sound the unrecorded one as
Sony completely blows this away so if
you mode it get tell me should I do
another short review review a video
demonstrating how it sounds with against
without mod it looks a bit ugly maybe
you could make it with some party I'm
not sure I just used hot glue to really
seal everything but then the sound is
amazing I mean
I prefer it over the moon drop Kenneth
point and everything else for a same
simple single driver design
I really wonder why Sony never improved
on this releasing a new version maybe we
could ask mess drop toe to toe but who
who the one the engineer who was
responsible for this was not Sony it was
from Ericsson so it was some some Nokia
engineer who did this
then when Sony BOTS Ericsson they did
this release under the Sony Ericsson
brand so this is nothing to do with Sony
it was just an engineer from Denmark
maybe Sweden or whatever who did this
really impressive tuning and no other
in-ear they struggle they struggle with
the simple smooth sound I mean this
these were uncompensated so not that
easy to read maybe I will show you the
measurements compensated for the
recording so that you see what you are
hearing so the balance tips for the icon
would look like this I mean looks quite
okay but you already see there is some
elevation in the four five six key notes
region also too much boost in the ten
kilos region when I overlay the single
Ian 700 Pro here you can see this huge
peak at 6 kilo Hertz apart on that it's
quite flat but the speak completely
destroys it the sony also compensated
like this would look like like that here
also not completely even but this is
just the compensation that I apply for
my recording to make it sound as close
to what I'm hearing but I think you can
see the Sony is definitely the most
balanced here also some slight peak at 6
kilos but it's not that horrible
maybe rather steep between 3 and 4 kilos
so I'm sorry to all those great pro
reviewers who praised this and I'm sorry
to the company I cannot I cannot listen
to this I'm sorry it's really nothing
that I would praise or want to listen to
it has this this thing that has this
horrible six kilohertz
emphasis which makes it unlistenable for
me yeah I mean I tried everything other
tips nothing it inside but it doesn't
stay that well so I cannot recommend
them maybe for people who really prefer
or don't care about this coloured sound
this strongly different to what was
recorded then yeah maybe okay if you
like bass if you like some strange mid
coloration go for the icon but I think
yeah the single is even worse for me
overall the bass is nicely flat it's
simply completely underwhelming overall
yeah so my take on the single in 700 Pro
and the icon which one
I really cannot follow all those great
reviews ravings no sorry it's better
than the BG BV BV dmg but still not
really listen about to me way too muddy
with the with the balance tips it's
muddy
at the same time boo me and coloured so
not what I would like to listen to ya
the clear winner is the modded cheap
Sony image one for $15 or whatever
really an amazing in here I wonder why
they never did something out of it the
sony ex1000
is a crap compared to this while still
getting lots of hype lots of praise the
best indie ever sony MDR x thousand
piece of so this was it thanks for
watching I hope you liked it I hope I
could give you some idea about the sound
of both mmm and see you in the next
video ah I have another headphone yeah
the nura phone this is a new sample that
I got directly from the company and as
all of you or many of you were assuming
it must have been that if defective the
unit that I had it did I had to they had
this is a new one
and I will try to prepare again a new
video and let's hear if there is really
that much difference to that broken one
which was not really broken so stay
tuned have a nice time and bye bye
