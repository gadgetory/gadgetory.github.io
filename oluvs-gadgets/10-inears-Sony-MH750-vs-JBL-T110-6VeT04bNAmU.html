at two budget in years from two of the
best most popular audio brands from Sony
and JBL so let's see what those huge
companies can offer for little money
like let's say around $10 maybe here I
have the Sony MH 750
I paid seven-year-olds you can also find
it for cheaper but you have to be
careful because of replicas there are
definitely some fakes around it was also
included for free with some experience
so really low is the budget and here I
have the GB LT 110 I paid 14 euros you
can also find it for cheaper I bought it
directly from the JBL store so a bit
more expensive was recommended to me by
one of my viewers claiming it's the best
yeah sure the sony was recommended to me
by John Young again and I know also one
of you mention it in a comment and yeah
it's not that bad actually John told me
this is some kind of cost cut cost down
version of the image one so there are
some similarities as we will see but
it's really lowest budget so below $10
and yeah let's see what kind of audio
quality they often before looking at
some measurements later on and we'll
also compare the MH 750 to the Sony
image one that I liked quite a lot let's
see how the Sony compares against the
JBL first I will start with the Sony
here let's put it inside here and then I
will switch to the JBL and at the very
end you will hear the original track so
you have an idea how it should sound in
reality so let's have a listen
my fantasies come to me you are in my
thoughts and never straight from the
heart of you
we can't be out
am i searching you I wanna feel
yeah I think you'd hear that JBL doesn't
really sound that great like many try to
suggest the Sony is not perfect it
improves a little bit with other tips it
just came with this very cheap packaging
just yeah this in here with one set of
tips the GBL came here with additional
tips also with the real packaging but
you're looking at some measurements
first the JBL in black here and the sony
in green you can see that yeah the JBL
has even more boosting bass and it has
this boost around four or five six
kilowatts way more trouble than the sony
which makes it sound a little bit off I
would say already the m8 750 has more
boost in this region compared to the
Sony image 1 so when I overlay let's put
their JBL away I don't think it's really
worth it money you can get better sound
for less like with this MH 750 so let's
put it away and I will overlay the Sony
MH one in blue here and you can see that
yet they measure quite similar but the
image one has definitely less response
in the presence region around 3 4 5
kilohertz also upper treble is a lil bit
more boosted on the MH 750 which makes
the image one definitely appear in sound
smoother instead I think there are some
similarities the MH 750 is probably
based on the image one just the cat
tried to cut costs down maybe use some
cheaper materials cheaper drivers or
whatever I think it still sounds great
but not as great and not as smooth as
the image 1 so let's listen again first
the image 750 then I will switch over to
the MH 1 and at the very end again the
original track
my fantasies call to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you
we can't
am i touching you I wanna feel
I think would hear the Sony image one
still has the nicer overall response
smoother more natural also nice at
rebels battle the image 750 is not bad
but because of this strong armed
presence boost it appears a bit harsh
still much better than many others like
the steam audio t2 pro yeah this sounds
really nice uh for less money and not
sure why people recommend many unknown
hyped brands this is really not that bad
but the image one is definitely better
although yeah you have to be careful if
you are interested in the image one this
is the original Sony Ericsson model
there is also this mh1 C which has a
normal connector this connector works
with iPhone also traded with Shannon
Shandling m1 player it doesn't work with
my PC so you only get some I don't know
some phase inverted sound but it works
well with iPhones my android phone
doesn't play with it so you would need
the image 1c version but it sounds a
little different so there is even less
of this presence region a bit more base
a bit more upper treble so it's more a
smile response compared to this this is
already a little bit too much base to
base heavy to be regarded as flat but
it's still very nice so I like the Sony
image one a lot the image 1 C is not
that bad either
so maybe if you don't have the type
comparison it would sound the same for
you but if you can compare back and
forth I always stick to the image 1
maybe I will do again a dedicated video
about the image 1 I already made a
review but just to sum up everything
also compare it to the image one is now
I have 7 or 8 different units all vary a
little bit with sound so we can maybe
compare the because frequency response
measurement but back to this
so between JBL and sony i would
definitely take this one for no $10 it's
a no-brainer I mean better than most of
this hyped case set in years it's just a
1 dynamic driver but really put on a
high level so it does doesn't need to be
three balanced armature drivers when the
result is so ugly like like you get with
those Chinese
try fi in years this is really nice the
JBL is not that great I am a bit
surprised because JBL Harman Kardon has
a huge research department the Hammond
response target for headphones comes
from there and then they offer this
here with some sizzling sound so really
horrible I don't know what Jay Bilas
doing I have to hear a good and really
decent sounding JBL headphone
although they have the biggest and he
had the most popular research department
the her results are simply crappy so in
this case on it definitely does a much
better job but the image one easily won
overall over the other soul so turns out
for watching I hope this was a bit
helpful yeah take a look on the m8 750
but be careful because of fake replicas
so thanks for watching until next video
