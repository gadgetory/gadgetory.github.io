world premiere comparing two of the
loudest portable Bluetooth speakers the
powerful roxtor and the sound box - i'm
of course aware of the diamond box excel
which is as loud as the sound box - but
definitely sounds better still it's not
really affordable here in Europe with
shipping taxes and so on you will
probably have to pay two thousand five
hundred maybe even three thousand heroes
while this year are more affordable for
an average Joe this cost thousand euros
the sandbox - 850
although the total rock star stretches
the term portable a little bit it's
rather rollable it has 35 kilograms so
carrying it around here for a long time
is quite impossible while the sound box
- with I think around 15 kilograms can
be still carried with one hand so for
real portable use the Sun box - is
definitely the nicest speaker still you
can see both are quite huge although the
total roxor is definitely more
professional gear here below and cover
you have a mixer with lots of knobs also
behind lots of inputs the sandbox - is
just a Bluetooth speaker with auxiliary
nothing else so I think even my mother
could use it but when I see all these
buttons here and getting a little bit
afraid but of course we don't be
interesting to hear how they sound
compared we already heard the sound box
- against immodest because like there's
only X between 90 and so on the trifle
roxtor definitely looks way more
professional as always I will be of
course using binaural microphones also
head came to give you this immersive 3d
person view also sound
you should of course listen with
headphones so put them on and let's have
a listen let's start with a track from
Simon grey and you can also check out
of the dials and knobs available under
this cover here as you can see it is a
two channel mixer with two brutal
sources or line or guitar on microphone
also a cross fader here a headphone out
and it has a 3-band equalizer so travel
meet please this becomes pretty heavy so
let's leave it at neutral everything
volume is already at maximum I am around
40% maybe and let's compare it to the
box
anymore - you're so nice somebody can
see the global reach already starts to
cut off here so I'm not sure we will be
able to try to make you wanna tell me
this will be strange here
as the name suggests let's try some rock
track maybe break up here
this song's really to compare so not in
the compare released or
way nicer phone
what I will do is also increase the Sun
box total maximum it has some dynamic
sound adjustment and then we can control
it so therefore maybe this will get rid
of the strange bonus here
so again increasing volume of the tire
feel nice some more - somehow horrible
here I cannot stay far away than eight
meters unusable get a penis has gone but
still
why the hyper students
yeah
you see simply too much I don't know it
distorts us crazy so I reducing it maybe
a little bit like this
and let's turn the volume up again
obviously there is no limit are not a
healthy one inside
Oh
maybe the
I'm already holding it as high as I can
you can see I mean this
otherwise my own box fool has no chance
here
we already beginning yeah I'm not
impressed with the Bluetooth which is
even worse than from the sound box and I
was already complaining about this one
here and also slightly too much
distortion at high levels I mean it's
crazy not maybe even twice as loud then
the son bookstore although you could
hear with lots of distortion you already
know it low levels there is something
rattling lots of vibrations and
obviously some huge woofers so yeah I
think it was pretty obvious sound wise
the total roxtor kiss the songbooks -
sounds way more hi-fi way nicer somehow
with really deep bass the sandbox blue
became a little bit strange honky
sounding although it's not perfect there
was some rattling inside also bass
becomes out of control at high levels so
you have to turn it down it's a bit
strange I thought the limiter would take
care of this automatically but obviously
you really have to check the level first
then reduce base according also to the
the material you are playing and it
makes him there was lots of distortion
so obviously here with loud effects you
will have to reduce volume path it was
also way louder than the sound box -
although the base became reduced quite a
bit bluetooth which is horrible on both
even more even worse on that paper so
it's not a speaker for going around
rather keeping your phone here but you
have this two channel mixer here so you
can attach two phones maybe and then
across fade between both so it's really
the more professional gear for I think
this could be used for a real concert
although yeah you could hear at high
levels a little bit out of control but
the sound is incredible
it sounds really high five also have
possibility to adjust the sound a little
bit more treble maybe a little bit less
bass so I'm quite impressed
I hope this could give you an idea about
this tool I know that many were asking
which sounds better
I think you'd hear whatever sounds way
better than the sandbox - although stay
it's a cheaper speaker it's way more
portable so with 15 kilograms you can
still carry it around this is really I
hardly managed to to put it into my car
and I cannot really roll it around here
so yeah I hope you like us the
comparison sorry for the Bluetooth for
the breakups but yeah I would have I
would have to keep my phone here but
then I cannot switch between both still
I hope this could give you a very first
impression yeah thanks all for watching
and see you the next video have a nice
time
I just came back from autos and the
closer listen there is indeed some
strange rattling inside which according
to TOEFL shouldn't be so it cannot be
ruled out that this unit has some
transport damage maybe you can see it
even has some dent here so maybe the
Transport Agency let it fall down or
something but The Heretic shouldn't be
you could still I think hear that it
sounds way better than the songbooks too
so it sounds simply way more HiFi a more
professional somehow he had a bluetooth
which was horrible but usually you are
standing behind the speaker has a DJ
mixing here you know but for my usual
videos when I stand in front of the
speaker it was quite bad the only
workaround I am not sure if they will
send me some replacement or if this goes
directly back I could try some bluetooth
dongle and and played from auxilary then
I can maybe stand go away 1015 meters
because from this distance it was way
too loud so I couldn't even turn it to
maximum because the loudness was really
high so even way louder than the sandbox
- definitely the loudest portable yeah
what rollable speaker but unfortunately
it seems to have some damage also
according to driver this is not a final
series unit so these are the very first
production units from the new production
this is an updated version of the
original trifle roxtor so this is a very
earlier it may be it still has some
issues so keep my current sound check
with a little bit grain of salt but I
think you could hear that the sound is
really really great really impressive I
mean not surprising given the size and
weight but obviously this unit has some
some defects some problem thanks again
for watching
