I have to use my Pandora megaphones
again just to record my voice so you
will also hear my entire surrounding
here like the fish tank on the left or
on your right or if some cars are
passing by outside I hope this is not
too distracting for you but maybe it
makes it also a little bit more
realistic but last time I lost the video
because of my leg make which I usually
use the one with the fur it has a bad
contact and I tried to fix it but still
it didn't record any audio I didn't
notice it so I just wasted my time with
this video and therefore to prevent it
and using this now but today I wanted to
present you another low-budget in-ear
from cases we already had the ATR which
is the cheapest maybe I have I have
another one which is comparable price
but I will present it in upcoming video
and the step-up model is the 80 I saw it
on gearbest I think seven or eight
dollars the ATR is six so it's not
really that much more expensive but
definitely a big step up and I would
like to compare this to also give you
some sound samples later on some
measurements but it's not that easy to
compare them as I cut a new unit of the
ATR the one I present it some time ago
sounds completely different
mm so I am not quite sure which one is
really representative I'm assuming the
new one here because the new one sounds
more similar to the a te while my old
one sounds quite off again I'm not sure
if it's because it's old maybe they
changed something in the meantime or if
it's some sample variation but before
comparing the ATR with the 80 I would
like to show you what the difference
between my old ATR unit and the new one
and first I also would like to show you
a tip with the tips I don't like the
sound with the original tips these here
are the hybrid tips from Sony you can
find on eBay around three four dollars I
will post a link in my video description
and these these are quite nice this is
the largest one and if you pull it up
you can see the both ATR and 80 have
quite a long nozzle so you can put up
the the tip here and pull it back you
like some force key maybe due to you
have to get the nozzle
make it again so like this it opens up
the sound you get multi
more upper treble which is a little bit
missing with both both the ATR and AD
they let's say treble heavy but they
miss the sparkle brilliance and I think
with the tip mm yeah
pull the back like a foreskin it's all
safely better but you would need a big
on because yet this changes the sealed
so if you usually use meet the mid sized
tips you will probably need larger ones
you can see because the tip changes also
the F form I did the same this is
another tip but here on the 80 it's the
same just pull it back if you would do
it with your penis it opens this nozzle
here and it definitely opens the sound I
like it much more so I recorded all of
them with the same tips also with the
same insertion depth that yeah I hope so
they should be comparable of course keep
the sound samples with a grain of salt
I'm quite satisfied now but it's still
not have a percent what I hear in
reality did I think the relative
differences should be okay because the
design is more less the same I'm using
the same tips I'm using the same
position and so on and the same
equalizing for all of them so you will
definitely hear some differences so
let's start maybe yeah I would like to
present you all so what I prepared I
prepared some kind of scent ler for
comparing headphones and in ears
consisting of five tracks now I will
play the first track from someplace
which I included this one as well
because I like it a lot for judging some
differences then I also have a another
track from Sanchez a kind of concrete
from the YouTube audio library some kind
of rock mmm yeah that I bought from what
was his name Illume amusing and last but
not least I have some hip-hop track from
audio channel yeah I would like to hear
your opinion about them first I will
play both ATR units only with the sole
persona track and then we will compare
the ATR and a te with all tracks it's
five minutes maybe too long just tell me
shall I cut and together shall I use
other tracks but I really need to use
copyright free tracks because for my
database
my speaker database the classical track
which is yeah and public domain
recording which was Gardena which was
recorded at the Gardner Museum and I got
repeatedly claims from some assholes
they want to copyright Tchaikovsky I'm
Uncle Phil and 200 year old musician and
they want to copyright is incredible
therefore I really wanted to get sure
actually I'm really getting problems
because of this Tchaikovsky now
because I used I was sure I can use it
it was also I have the license I mean
it's from an n Gardner Museum some some
and now some esos repeatedly and
different ones from no fine tunes from
whatever the same piece some even don't
know the name just unknown unknown title
but Clemens go figure
s holes this whole Content ID on
YouTube is really ok sorry but let's
start I will play just the old Katie
Katie our first Katie a TR k is that
80-yard then the new mode like that so
you can hear the differences and then
we'll discuss it a little bit and later
on I will compare the new one against
the 18th so have a listen I would use of
course the easier for the recording and
demonstrating
see come to me you are in my thoughts I
never stray from the heart of you
so I think you could hear the alte ATR
unit that I have has the strange
funkiness also some treble sizzle which
the new one doesn't have it's still two
treble heavy somehow there is some
ringing with the treble but the treble
is fuller and it doesn't have this
hunkiness anymore so then if all current
units sound like this I think this is
definitely an improvement but it's still
not really dead balance let's say and
this is whether a te does the trick I'm
not sure what they changed yeah you can
have a look inside threesome Trevor
visible I think it's nice also not that
easy to see which one the left or right
is so here is some imprint left and
right but I usually I take them into my
hand and if the wire is at the out
outside I know that this is the right
one and this is the left one so yeah I
showed it
let me try how to insert them like this
and over the year try again you can see
this this is my running kick from
someone so and you put them inside your
ear like this just get sure to get a
nice fit to use the right tips and
really put them back as if you would do
it with your penis
so yeah comparing this tool which we'll
do now and I will play now all tracks
afterwards he had just skip if you are
not interested but I think every track
reveals other differences also the
imaging appears different because they
differ slightly between left and right
so there is some difference on the right
side there is always some slight peak
which the old ATR didn't have but we'll
look at the measurements later on so now
the eight the new ATR unit against the a
te and again starting with the ATR
is it just to treat my being inside my
fantasies call to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you
I can't
so you could hear overall they sound
quite similar but the a te yeah gives
more refinement to the sound it gets the
salt more balanced somehow the treble is
not as harsh anymore
it's still not perfect so it has too
much lower treble or too much treble
overall but too little spittle too
little brilliance but from that I think
it's really a great in here for this
price seven or eight dollars on gearbest
or I think it's also a little on my lips
Express for this price so I have more
expensive ones which I will present you
some upcoming videos which are worse
than this so currently I think this will
be my reference for any year below $10 I
also have some from EDX or EDX which was
suggested to me being great it's not bad
but definitely worse than this with even
more metallic treble this sounds nice it
would need some slight taking down some
treble and boosting up or travel around
16 kilohertz maybe to get this this nice
pocket and then they are close to
perfect I mean for this price
no complaints we can also look at some
measurements I will start with the old
ATR that we've already seen and you can
see yeah there is this peak at around 4
5 kilo Hertz then we get again some deep
at around 7 kilo Hertz if I overlay the
new ATR here but I think now first I
will show you that 80
alone the new one you can see the left
channel has some peak here between five
and six kilohertz or the right one has a
deep which is really strange and the new
the a te has the same it has the left
one has some peak while the right one is
rather flat so I will average the left
and try it for all of them so you can
see there the old ATR the new one you
can see the new one has doesn't have
this peak at four five kilo Hertz then
more in the seven 8 kilohertz region
which is probably too much so yeah you
could hear that well it was just too
metallic to 2 mm to dominant also more
bass than the old one I really not sure
if it's just simple variation or if they
changed something in the meantime some
quality control I'm really not sure but
what can you expect from an India which
costs 10 dollars I mean the the triple
driver hit three of them and all three
sounded different and these are in use
that cost 50 60 or even up to hundred
dollars now they released a Bluetooth
version the triple driver bTW sorry
we'll start again different so and last
at least I will overlay the 80 here and
you can see the a te I will throw away
the old a TRS it doesn't fit you into
this comparison and you can see then the
a te brings the straddle down also this
peak at think kilohertz is not that
strong anymore
bass is a little bit more balanced than
on the on the ATR and overall simply
smooth that still not perfect I think
we're just taking a look at 80 alone you
can still notice some slight peak
between 5 and 6 kilohertz so smoothening
this out and maybe raising up a treble
slice it would make the a te sound
really really great it it's already
great now I like it a lot and after some
time you get used to the sound because
it doesn't sound off like the ATR the
first unit did it has this strange I
don't know honk enos not sure how to
call it nasality but this one sounds
really nice just that the travel overall
is not perfect but I think
non audio files wouldn't even notice I
mean they are listening with this
strange Sony in years but I really just
horrible I mean so this sounds really
great and I will use it in my future
videos as my friends until I have found
something better below ten dollars
because a I think it's a prototype for
nice sound not perfect but nice cheap
sound and you get a way better
experience if you want to listen to
music than from some hundred dollar
bluetooth speaker so it's really a
bargain I would say so
coming up next yeah tell me how you like
my sound my selection of sound samples
if you have better ones of course
copyright free and free either audio
jungle or whatever there are so many if
you have some tract that you like or if
you think I would include more I'm not a
certified with the rock sample but I
like because it has some really punchy
bass there is some lower base you could
maybe remember in my videos where I
reviewed some Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen speakers
all of that we start with this vector it
has boo boo boo if you want illness
within ears but you hear if it has this
low low bass energy it's not a real rock
track but I like the kickers and not a
rock listeners so I prefer funk no
Frank and and also the end stuff groovy
house deep house soulful house fusion
that kind of stuff I'm not a rock list
man I don't like acoustic I included a
vocal track and more acoustic one just
for all those who need vocals and I
don't think you can judge the sound from
vocals that well the best really best is
pink notes if you compare it with peak
noise you will immediately see
differences and the problem is if you
turn them around in your ear slightly so
you insert them in to move them around
you will notice how much the sound
changes will fit with pink box with
music not that much especially with
vocals you won't even notice if there is
treble missing because vocals don't have
anywhere but with peak noise you hear
immediately if you have them right if
the left one sounds different to the
right one this is quite interesting also
rock really heavy metal it's all like
pink noise so
I should have maybe included some heavy
metal track tell me your European I
really want your input into this because
if I once managed something like a
database for headphones I want to use
some consistent recording so we can
record in ears and headphones that I had
months ago which I don't own anymore
and yeah like I have with the speakers
it has to be on the same tracks and I
want to limit it to five minutes or even
shorter temmie five minutes is too long
to listen to maybe i should shorten the
samples but i by all means I want to
have the saw pass on a track or another
track from him included because his
recordings I managed to to notice most
differences with his recordings like
yeah I put put put in another song and
the difference is not that viewed for me
but was so personal I can immediately
hear if something is not right
I'm not quite sure why his his mixing is
really great he told me that he is
mixing he has some I think he's some old
genetic molecules and he's also mixing
with with the HD 650 so yeah yeah but
don't want to bore you let me see yeah
already twenty minutes come on for a
first funky little endian I think it's
great definitely recommended but I
cannot ensure that all sound the same
now having two different units of the
ATR which is not completely different
I'm afraid that it could be the case
with the eighty as well so maybe the one
you get doesn't sound the same as mine I
could order another one but look there
are so many other images I don't want to
concentrate on this one but currently I
think around ten dollars this is
definitely one of the better ones if not
the best I like it way more than those
Xiaomi hybrid whatever and it sounds
more balanced without this boosted bass
it still somehow elevated but I would
regard it as still neutral it's not bass
boost it in anyway so more comparable
tool to a neutral monitor also coming up
next is is
a review from from an automatic head
from the mk5
which was recommended to me often I also
saw great reviews but this is really I'm
very ambivalent about it it's no it's
I'm not compatible with it my ears it
needs very deep insertion I had one
automatic some years ago and was was hey
I was shocked how bad it was I think I
really I didn't insert it deep enough
because if you just put it in like
normal
aeneas it is some honky cheap clock
radio sound but if you really until it
hurts if you pull it that deep inside
yeah I felt as if I was raped
I don't know but suddenly the sound was
there it was still not perfect so it's
rather thin sounding really thin
sounding in here the base is there but
very recessed and mids are still too to
pronounce somehow many claim this is
flat it's as flat as possible it's not
it's not the sound as I would perceive
as flat so automatic will be also
reviewed it was very hard to record some
samples for it because the sound change
is so much depending on the insertion in
the yes I'm not like human years so I
had to really stick the in-ear more or
less on the microphone directly in order
to get the right sound yeah eyeball you
enough thanks for your patience for
listening I hope you liked it anyhow
I liked the 18 you really not it's nice
just taking without being worried that
it breaks or something so if it breaks
get another one and hope it sounds the
same but I like this one here yeah
apart from speakers some interesting
ones coming too
we will have lots of different in ears
yeah just tell you which ones the final
audio e mm will be coming it's not that
great like many claims it's okay but
still far from really great then the
automatic NK NK v then I have this EDX
EDX is it some Chinese one
I think it doesn't every evening I think
it's only EDX then I have some I thought
even know if I should review it was
recommended by a friend of mine - Walker
a7 he was so excited about it it's so
great let me see what hits the left I'm
here I think fresh minutes because my
camera always stops after half an hour
and yeah it's just available and way too
much travel for me so it's nicely
balanced but then suddenly well you get
you get punched by this trouble so I
would even take the 80 over this -
Walker what else do we have
yeah more many more coming which haven't
arrived yet
but the team thin thing tp2 I think then
also from Cosette more than more per
class models yeah I have the cue tool
from reef reef audio
I think Nicole that is very similar to
the case that zs6
not listen to more very strange treble
so it's not it gets all so much hype so
many great videos this case at set of
six first I thought it might be
defective the unit I have but when I
heard the queue to know from Revo maybe
it's we were on river
something with reve reve all reef mmm it
sounds much the same bit smoother but
obviously yeah it's a sound signature
which I just cannot wait too much Trevor
and peaky Trevor
I hate peaky Trevor I I like a treble
post overall if Trevor is boosted but if
there are some Peaks it becomes
unbearable because the peaks boost it
even more and you get this ringing or
whistling and with most of them the a
thematic is the only one which has nice
travel a little bit too boosted maybe
but it also depends a lot on insertion
it's it was really horrible
hey I thought the whole whole day to get
some nice seal not only seal but the
strong I put it inside the more it hurt
the better the son became so it's it's
not for everyone
but and might maybe check out some
further automatic in the future still
from what I've seen and read all of them
are lacking based so it's not what I
would perceive as neutral sound because
the base is just very very flat
I listen to my recordings and all this
because I recorded were missing base I
couldn't tell any difference between the
Onyx to do Fife and the doc I defined
the base sounded the same
although the the Onyx has way more lower
base but it was not here include an
emoticon the rest was great treble meets
sounded quite natural also imaging was
as if I was sitting inside this room but
everything else was just off like we see
yeah I hey I think I have to stop
otherwise my camera will stop stay tuned
for some upcoming videos also give me
some time
yeah it's I'm really at the point where
YouTube starts to become a bit annoying
because I put so much effort inside and
not that much is coming back I got some
really generous donations again I cannot
name any games now don't remember but
really thanks a lot to those who once
sent me fifty dollars so really I
appreciate it a lot
justice I forget to write something back
and say thank you so I say thank you
here with this video and in future let's
see maybe I will really start this
patreon but I don't want to beg for
money therefore I'm really hesitant with
this patreon because it would look as if
I was yea asking give me your money and
I give you something but I have nothing
to offer you know what I will of course
do some do waste and for those who who
support me in some way but I cannot I'm
not that person who makes money from
others I did it already and ask for
donations I am continually no I think I
have to stop sorry my camera will stop
immediately so one two three</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
