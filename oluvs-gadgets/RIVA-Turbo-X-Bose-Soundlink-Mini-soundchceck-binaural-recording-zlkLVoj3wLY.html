previous videos that the river tawa X is
a pretty solid high loudness performer
it sounds really good full-bodied major
at high levels even at maximum volume
there is no bass reduction at all and
this time I wanted to demonstrate you
how it performs at lower levels what
kind of sound you can expect and I
thought to take the Bose Soundlink mini
as reference the bosonic mean is one of
the most popular portable speaker models
it has a very full-bodied what I would
call maybe bloated just like me sound at
lower levels it's a bit too thick
already it's nicely rounded sounds very
very big despite being well quite small
but the sound decreases at higher levels
I mean bass is going to be reduced at
maximum volume it hardly sounds better
than many speakers you can get for $50
um therefore I thought I will sit down
here and listen to the speakers at a
lower level I will keep the gain of my
recorder at the same level keep please
keep my voice as reference or as a guide
for the correct listening loudness then
I will put them farther away increase
the loudness on both so that you can
hear how the sound changes I mean it
seems as if the river became better and
the Bose worse but in reality the river
keeps always the same sound regardless
if it's low level low tide or high level
and the Bose is just boosting bass at
low levels but then starting reducing
bass at higher levels and I think this
is what you will hopefully hear from
this video okay here they are and as you
can see I set them up one above the
other
to avoid any
left-right separation I will be playing
a song from Saltair freesias which is
sole persona together with princess
Frieza a pretty great new soul R&amp;amp;B album
and I start with the boss which is
playing at about half volume slightly
below and the river matched volume wise
so have a listen and enjoy
I put them far away no the post is
playing at about 75% now the river again
matched volume-wise and I'm starting
again with the post and the same song
okay and now the post is playing at its
maximum volume while the river is still
quite a bit below but more or less
matched to the balls volume rise please
have a listen
okay now let's turn the river up to 11
pose again
okay I think it was clear my intention
to show you the difference in sound and
how it changes dynamically according to
the loudness level which it doesn't with
the river but it does with the bows if
you want high loudness high performance
well I think they realize the way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
