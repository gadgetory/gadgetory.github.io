look at this and either MBO smart
headset which is a kind of complete
binaural recording solution for iOS
devices so currently only available with
lightning connector but from what I
heard and as I will also is a microUSB
version in future which should work with
Android as well so basically these urban
are microphones to go with in-ear
headphones so how does this work you
simply put them into your ears like this
connect it to your phone and as soon as
you record video then audio will be
recorded through the microphones here
you can also record audio separately
with some app and then synchronize to
another video cam and if you listen for
headphones they should give you the
effect as if you were listening to the
recording life unfortunately some people
still think that putting some
microphones into your ears pressing
record will give you a really lifelike
results I mean this is maybe great for
recording some traffic noise outside or
I don't know but I tried them out and
they don't really sound right so with my
traditional a normal recording setup I
it took me weeks of tweaking really
equalizing the sound to get exactly or
let's say as close as possible to
reality s what I'm hearing through the
headphones yeah before trying them out
and also comparing them to my
traditional binaural microphones that I
have here let's have a short look
sennheiser market stem is some 3d
recording and high fidelity headphones
with above behind right left
localization crowley's you can see the
microphones are not really inside your
ears or rather outside so i'm not sure
how they want to really get some
up-and-down localization without
recording the human age rtfs the
complete complete new resonance you
won't get any kind of localization just
some yeah rough left right and the
problem is that the frequency response
is simply completely off not only from
the microphones which we'll hear later
on but also from the head from the
headphones the headphones sound nice
generally but they have a very strong
travel seasoning treble and even when
you listen to your recordings through
these headphones they sound completely
off way to travel heavy so yeah as
mentioned it's maybe ok if you record
some birds chirping but if you want
really really sound which I'm intending
to present you so the real sound of a
speaker you have a faint completely
apart from that yeah they are nice they
have some remote control here you can
adjust this button to either change gain
also quite a problem they only have two
gain levels either high or low you
cannot really control gain in a fine way
they have some kind of how do they call
this yeah situation awareness so when
you just listen to music you can also
feed in some noise from the microphones
so that you can hear what is around you
but still although something nice the
travel is simply way to to pronounce -
sizzling the end I thought we will
compare them we will listen to the
stages in s3 is because I reviewed some
days ago comparing to my traditional
microphones they have here and you can
tell me afterwards which you like more
but I can already tell you know that
when listen through a neutral pair of
headphones like the sennheiser HD 600
this sound completely of also noise
floor is a little bit higher than from
mine there is this other model binaural
microphone model from Roland C cs100 EMF
a at 10:00 a.m. I think are much cheaper
this cost $300 the Roland's I think 80
so less than one third and I think there
Orleans give you even better results
than this I'm really not that impressed
I saw some videos from James review room
where he walked through through the town
recording some noise it was okay I was
quite surprised that there was indeed
some great localization but I was
curious to hear them how would they
perform with really high end or HiFi
sound and this is where they
unfortunately fail a little bit so yeah
please put your headphones up and let's
check them out
I will start with the mb of smart
headset the audios we call it
the apogee metal recorder the South I'm
hearing is some kind of mix between life
sound and you had the recorded sound
also some delay so it's a little bit
annoying but you can hear imaging works
nice maybe even some up and down not
sure but my voice appears different to
what you are probably used from my usual
microphones and I also think his is a
little bit louder with the MBO smart
headset here my usual microphones you
can hear my voice appears again
different and also his is a little bit
lower but now let's listen to the stages
because I temporarily set them up like
this I like them quite a lot I'm really
considering keeping them of course I
will hide all the cables maybe attach
the Apple TV through optical in so I
have airplay but now let's listen to
trade from so personal traces freesia
and yeah the MB or smart headset first
so what I'm hearing now through the
phones is some really seasoning sound
not even close to what her here in
reality and yeah there is some delay and
also the sound is shifted to the left
compared to my usual setup although I
sit exactly centered looking straight
ahead the sound has some left bias maybe
let's increase running again
my everything it's normal that there
because response changes in food because
like this microphones gets found
straight ahead
why like this yes it's rather of FX's
yeah I am personally not that impressed
I expected a little bit more out of them
to tell the truth here but it really
took me weeks of tweaking to get the
sound as close to reality as possible
with my setup I could maybe equalize
them as well but already the noise floor
is too high so when I start equalizing
them it will become even higher and I
already think that mine have too much
his therefore I won't keep them I was
really curious to hear them and yeah
also having them attached to through the
iPhone all the time yeah it's not really
that comfortable
I prefer recording with an external
recorder so I think this decision to go
with lightning is just a limitation so
it would be better with a normal
headphone input and you would need a
recorder yeah tell me what you think
about them
the imaging is maybe it's different but
also I had I really had to shift the
whole sound to the right because it
seems as if the left microphone was
recording
pull out compare to the right one so
they are not okay
I mean for this price they should be at
least matched yeah so I didn't want to
give you any full review about them just
give you some ideas I was personally
curious to hear them yeah they come with
additional tips as you can see I had to
put up the biggest ones because the
medium ones which I usually have didn't
work for me I had hardly any base and
these are also very hard compared to
many other tips yeah so I think this was
it I'm not that impressed with the MPR
smart headset and if others are
recording because with them you can be
sure that you don't get the real sound
how it's supposed to sound in reality
may be great or nice for going out and
definitely better than the internal
microphone over over over a smartphone
but not really meant for critical or for
no high end recording I'm a little bit
disappointed for this price but I mean a
real professional binaural recording
solution like this from Monday kayuu
hundred the artificial head cost eight
thousand euros so quite a bit more than
this or even my solution but I think I'm
quite satisfied and in future I will try
to maybe tweak the sound even more to
get even closer to reality when I have
more time and I yes quite satisfied when
I compare them to these with my
microphones I really hadn't provide
impression as if I was sitting in front
of the speaker's when listen to the
recording while here completely
something different so this were not the
speakers I heard in reality and this is
a pity because I expected a little bit
more out from them yeah thanks a lot for
watching I hope I didn't bore you too
much just wanted to also give you an
idea for those who are interested in
this I think they are way too expensive
if at least the headphones sounded
perfect but the seasoning travel is
really quite annoying you get the
impression of some detail but if you
listen to your own recordings made to
these
it's complete something completely
different not something you hear in
reality part way to travel heavy
therefore yeah it's not really not
really that great yeah again thanks a
lot for watching and see you the next
year a nice toilet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
