remember I already made a video about
the Nike free play life it was a litte
bit underwhelming at normal levels into
us but it's really loud so maybe twice
the loudness of the JBL boombox for
comparable speakers so for an Autobody
for making some noise out to us I think
this should do a better trick than all
the other ones
all those boom boxes also quite a
balanced sound but without any bass
enhancement or something but making is
also smaller speakers like this make you
free play home and even smaller one that
go I only have these two here and today
we'll concentrate on the free play home
as the name already suggests it's
targeted or aimed at home use but it's
only a Bluetooth speaker so there is no
Wi-Fi included no airplay no other
features it can charge external devices
but it needs a proprietary charger there
is a battery built-in so you can use it
but there is no grip so it's not that
easy to carry it around and the most
interesting part would be of course how
it sounds you can always compare it from
a database compare it to the bigger one
to any other speaker I think the turn
price is around $200 or 250
and I think for this size it's not that
impressive either I mean it's quite
balanced so looking at the measurement
you can see that this sound is quite
imbalance but it remains always like
this at low levels at high levels there
is no change so at low levels it's
rather a pious thing is there is no
dynamic based adjustment and base
doesn't reach really that deep but now
let's compare it to some other speakers
I have at home I would like to do this
in a kind of live video wearing my
Vanara microphones and my head came to
offer you this first person view and 3d
sound you should of course listen with
headphones put them up and let's check
it out every turn on they make it so you
can hear the welcome tones and first
let's compare it to a speaker which I'm
not allowed to reveal yet therefore it's
covered by some acoustically transparent
fabric but you can see it's quite a bit
smaller also lighter it's smaller but
let's see how it is to compare I will
start with the Mickey FreePlay home
first
yeha speaker get anticipate the size
difference you can hear that them Mickey
free play home sensitive in also it has
some treble sizzle so the travel is
quite sharp the other one some simply
bigger and smoother at the same time
also here constantly bigger with more
baby
then Mickey free play is marketed as
some home speaker therefore I think it
should be rather compared to something
like this the audio Pro I don t know C 3
so this is the Wi-Fi version the T 3 is
small as the same with all the Wi-Fi and
also cheaper you can find it for around
150 euros I think this is around 200 250
so let's compare how these two sounds
again starting with the Mickey free play
home first
he has this clarity which seems really
exaggerated it is some real teeth but
it's somehow missing base especially at
low levels now track so for home
listening I think here it doesn't do a
great job
your power
basically a warmer sound more pleasing
fully simple
that's right it is
you can definitely hear way more bass
notes from the organ here
deeper bass notes so also against them
the audio Pro it sounds a little bit
thin maybe let's try something even
smaller the sony SRX XP 30 an older
model but definitely better than the new
one has nice bass adjustment for low
levels also quite loud so let's hear how
they sound also high levels but first at
normal levels and again free play home
first
this is playing without extra bass now
he really sounds bigger now
not affect a bit more money or some
motivational so the drivers from the
Mickey are definitely dispersed the
sound a bit better in here but still
regarding the price I think this is less
than half the price you can get it for
the low hundred dollars careful
not effect
you can of course turn on extra base
I'll return it off again written here
it's nothing special so for this size I
would have expected a bit more it has
this clarity which a little bit too if
you exaggerate it already and Sony
everything more convincing here
let's listen what happens at higher
levels then make it keeps this level up
to maximum so hardly any base reduction
and it's quite loud but let's see which
one is louder here so this is the neck
pain this is Wellington XM no maximum
put here no taste reduction ah yes ah me
the juicy face buttons justice log
even slept in order but also more
compressed let's try this dress just the
neck you know
not much distortion quite control the
Sony
here even people based somehow more
contrast or justice lottery is not in
order
and analytic visit wanted to teleport
this restaurant it's really not much now
they're so for a party disappointing
not a bit more boys was a little bit
more distorted but their own even louder
and then make I think you'd hear it's
really nothing that special the sound is
okay
I mean it's balanced it has this tremor
peak which makes it appear a bit
sizzling but it looks somehow body to
the sound so this small speaker
definitely outperformed it at this level
of course this was louder and also keeps
all the bass after mixing we could hear
it maybe with their Sony this reduced
base at higher levels like this kept it
but still the Sony was just as loud and
maybe even slightly punch out in this so
for home use where I would rather use a
speaker like this with a nice warm sound
also Wi-Fi included so you can stream
from I don't know Google cast or airplay
also from tuning this is a litte bit
underwhelming to me because it's not
really that loud the sony was just as
loud and yeah it's quite huge already so
and not i mean it's not a bad sounding
speaker
you could hear Saudis balance quite open
the treble is just a bit too much for me
so it has this this treble peak at
around 12 kilo Hertz but yeah it's
nothing nothing exciting nothing special
you can definitely get better speakers
smaller speakers with comparable sound
and loudness so I hope this video could
give you an idea but they make you free
play home I will pass on the replay goal
is already this one little bit
disappointing to me and it's not bad but
it's nothing that I would like to listen
to music - with yeah I would definitely
take this only way cheaper smaller toss
it into some bag take it out with extra
bass it sounds really nice also autos
this is definitely too thin for me it's
neither a music monitor nor something I
don't know Nora boombox it's something
in between and doesn't really cut it so
yeah this was my take on the Mickey
FreePlay home we already have to hit the
Mickey free play life which is quite
great
quite nice especially for high levels it
makes me it really blew away all the
others in this size that I know
well other than that keeps came see
three or
boombox laughing yeah even lighter I
think of course without this pace this
heavy boosted's extra bass or whatever
but quite a nice song so this was my
take on making speakers I won't get that
goal because I don't think it can even
compete with the Sony s already now I
like the Sony more than the home version
here yeah this was this was it thanks
all for watching and see you the next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
