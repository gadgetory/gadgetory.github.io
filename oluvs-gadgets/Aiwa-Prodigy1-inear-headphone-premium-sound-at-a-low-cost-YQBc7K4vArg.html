presented something not quite speaker
related namely an ephah model from Iowa
a prodigy one some of you might not even
be aware that beside that quite popular
and really great Bluetooth boombox XS 9
which gets the highest ratings also one
of the best bang for your buck
I have also released an IE m or India
monitor let's simply call in phone some
months ago and I think for this price
$50 it's also great value or greatest
value let's say I have some compared
ones like here from terrain waves that
s0 also one from monkey or a Bluetooth
model II 700 PT way more expensive but
compared to that I heard a sound really
crappy so far I'm still sticking with my
old trusty ultimate is triple five 10
back then they cost $400 so really
expensive I also tried some models from
Westone etive m√≤r ticks I think I don't
even know how to pronounce them but I
didn't like the results I like the
ultimate is quite a lot but I think was
something that I ver for 50 dollars can
offer even better results and I would
like to show you this usually I don't
quite review headphones here I have my
play h6 my sennheiser HD 6 a lot simply
because i cannot offer you that
realistic sound impressions that I can
offer you from speakers I am in the
process of trying maybe in future I will
do more and headphone reviews I know
there is a site like sonic sense they to
offer or did offer I think they are out
of business now they had some headphone
comparisons with audio samples so it's
definitely an interesting topic but
without being able to provide you at
least some frequency response
measurements some graphs
I rather didn't want to review
headphones so far but this one is
definitely worth mentioning yes you can
see this is the packaging so this brings
the term frustrating frustrating free
packaging to a new level it's just an
envelope and inside you will find that
the headphone earphone let me open this
so we'll do it with a quick unboxing or
inside your finders nice pouch case some
manuals warranty cards
nothing else and this was it and I think
it's great no fancy packaging no no
great design just some simple envelope
yeah and these are the earphones so
let's open this let's have a look inside
so like this same / in ears with some
additional ear tips so I will open this
and they also come with with a kind of
one button remote it doesn't have any
volume but you can where is it
there it is you can stop playback static
double click will jump to the next track
triple to the previous one yeah you
cannot control volume the biggest part
for me was that the tips the included
ones didn't quite fit they're also
really really tight so it's not easy to
put them up and I tried all of them I
didn't get a good seal with them so the
sound was not that great also they are a
little bit treble heavy so let me try so
it's really not easy and then I tried
experimenting with different ear tips
have some compliments so foamies I think
that like this some dual flange triple
flange and I have ones like this with a
quite big hole and somehow yeah I got a
pretty good fit with them and then I
thought yeah the trailer was still a
little bit too shrill so I took a piece
of toilet paper you cannot do this with
the original tape so you should yeah for
eBay you can find four three four
dollars a set of tips yeah and then I
put some toilet paper here so with some
kind of fully putting them up it's best
to maybe put them to the other side it's
not easy so it took me definitely one
hour to to make it perfect otherwise you
will also kill the paper
better than toilet paper is some coffee
machine filter maybe because it's it's
stronger and doesn't hear that that
easily but if you manage and let me try
so now yeah they are up later on you
will simply clear this away
the toilet paper X is some slight filter
and the funny thing is the usual
response I would describe it like this
there is some slight base emphasis not
upper base rather some lower base so it
has a smile response also some strong
a12 emphasis and for my taste it will be
too much presence but with these tips
and also with some toilet paper the
presence goes away and also the upper
trail emphasis goes away and they sound
really smooth now of course you still
need a good seal a good fit but and how
they I mean I prefer them over the
Sennheiser HD camera keep in mind they
are not studio monitors so they have a
fan tuning but really tasteful compared
to the brain waves which are really
muddy the treble is not right
the same for the onkyo which have
bluetooth and everything but I mean here
I prefer sometimes overhead connection
because also when I when I watch videos
from YouTube of a Bluetooth there is
some delay sure but also there are some
front drapes at frame from drapes frame
drops especially on an iPad iPhone if
you stream over Bluetooth and you watch
a 60 p video you will see that the
movement is not fluent this does not
happen through a wired connection so now
with this sound I have a second model
which I already prepared here they sound
really great and I'm really yeah I'm
blown away for this price I mean fifty
dollars a single driver earphone I take
them over the ultimate ears tribute fire
any day because they are really heavy to
fit into your ears and then first of all
your music yeah you need to take them
over your ear like this then they stick
out of here completely and a and not
fled either they have a strong upper
treble emphasis also basis rather let's
say there is too much upper base why
these they sound like get better than
they do play h4 h6 sorry I also have the
FOH 4 which is bluetooth not quite sure
which one sounds better the h6 or the h4
but here for $50 you get a really decent
quality and I would definitely if you
are in the market for some decent pair
of ear phones not bluetooth
synchron's yeah you should try them out
here maybe notice that trainer is in a
bit to overemphasize but you can easily
think of them
one thing that I'm missing here I cut
this from some other head from Hawaii I
don't know something Chinese is that of
course you will get some cable noise if
you put them inside your ears the cable
will dangle around so like this you can
stick it to your to your shred then
there won't be any any any pool on the
on the cable and you won't get that much
micro phonics I think this is the
correct term yeah I started with in-ear
headphones maybe 15 years ago where
there was still lots of crap on the
market I had some molds from West stone
from 18 mortix
I don't know how to proceed English ate
at time optics I don't know but they
were really crappy I mean I paid five
hundred dollars for this West stone and
can remember you something you for but
it sounded horrible really very meat
focused I tried all kinds of tips but
they just didn't sound good I was glad
to be able to sell them again for quite
a decent price but now after 15 years
the market has changed quite a lot and
I'm really impressed I have many other
cheap ones from China Bluetooth ones and
I simply I didn't want to review them
because this sound if they had not worth
even mentioning they have Bruton via
great but if the sound is crappy I mean
I wouldn't like to listen to music but
this I can enjoy music really a lot
these are again some other tips I got
from some Chinese sure clone they are
designed like a yet they look like some
hearing aid let some sure model I'm not
sure also a dual driver completely
crappy compared to this so I'm really
really impressed although not perfect
but you can tune the sound real liking
thanks to some slide maybe filtering
with this with toilet paper with coffee
paper coffee machine paper or whatever
and also try experimenting with
different tips the ones included none of
these did really fit and they have
really tough to put on so very stiff it
took me some minutes to really to to be
able to amount at least one but
those with bigger holes they are quite
easy to mount and also give some
slightly better sound also look at the
entire diameter yet the size of the hole
at the front
these ones are slightly smaller although
a big at the back and they offer I think
a little bit bad result so yeah just
wanted to present you this I know that I
will release a bluetooth headphone over
here as well soon I think there is some
pre-order starting next week I'm really
curious what they are up to because so
far the XS 9 was great these are great
so Adam I saw some shot unboxing on
YouTube they look also great unlike some
other Bluetooth I just tested one from
Sennheiser at the age of four point five
zero also brutal model completely
horrible sound for $200 I cannot imagine
how someone would like to listen to this
they also have active noise control
South even worse when turn on so come on
here for little money you get really
really great sound with some slides
tinkering some slides yeah experimenting
so I hope you liked this little video
really great offering from over here and
quite impressed and definitely one of my
favourite earbuds so far I like them all
I love the triple fight quite for quite
a long time but this a better simply
more fun more nice nicer bass treble is
not as extreme because these some are
like in the presence region but then
again the upper curve is very very
detailed very maybe in Rodge while this
with this tuning they sound really
really outstanding so in future I will
of course try to - maybe also offer you
some headphone reviews but as long as
I'm not able to really give you this
great quality which I'm able to do with
speakers I rather want because it
doesn't make sense but these ones I had
to present because they are simply so
great you can check out the reviews on
Amazon most of them I mean they're not
the most comfortable words they also
stick a little bit out of the year
not much at
you get a good fit they are quite
comfortable
unlike the ultimate yes here which are
really very very beaconed and yeah so I
hope you like this little video thanks
for watching and see you next one have a
nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
