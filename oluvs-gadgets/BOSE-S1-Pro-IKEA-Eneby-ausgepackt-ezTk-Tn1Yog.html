yes!
so come over here and help me a bit
you know what? I'd need some scissors, I think they are at your place somewhere over there
will you bring me some?
I am curious what that is
a friend has sent me this
from Germany, you know?
let's look inside
here we go
wow, look! no wait, I'll have to take this, you take the scissors.
although, it's not that heavy
hey, there is something else inside
IKEA
a shelf or something?
hmm, let's see what that is
we can put this away, we don't need it anymore
I think we still need the scissors, come on
I saw some sticky tape
what shall we open first?
this here
looks interesting, nicely big
look: Bose S1 pro, you can take this
uahhhh
so we can also put this away
let me see
carefully, carefully
it's stuck somewhere
wow, cute!
we will put everything else away, we don't need it anymore
a shelf from Ikea! Great, what shall I do with it?
wow, you can also tilt it backwards!
look, here it also has feet I think
here, so this means you can also place it like that
let's see if we can connect
look how many dials!
look here
you can attach a microphone, or a guitar and so on
here too
here too, yes. this means you could attach a microphone at one of these, and a guitar at the other one and doongoo doongoo doonggg...
and here bluetooth, so let's try
hmmmmm
let me have a look
is something flashing?
not sure if I have to do pairing mode or not
maybe press longer
it's already
well, but it doesn't appear
here it is now, look
you have to press longer indeed
look, here's volume
this is low, this is high
you can turn it even higher, although it snaps in here
OK, so let's have a listen
so, come over to me, let's see what we have here
ho ho ho
and? what do you think?
too much bass!
really?
let's try tilting it back
and? less?
yes
but I think I like it better with more bass, look
yeah, hits the spot
we could also try the other position
which one, like this?
like this it also sounds good
but not that much bass either, I think like this it has most bass
let's try something else
fares well
look! look, here you can see a huge woofer
you can see it well from the side
then it still has 3... 1, 2, and in the center a third one in front
I think these are fullrange drivers
doesn't look like tweeters, but look it still disperses the sound nicely to the sides
not that directional
come on, not that close, sit down to me here
you know what?
we could compare it to the Teufel
will you bring it here, or do you think it is too heavy?
try
fine
look, it is nearly just as big
let me try
look, it's not that much bigger
sounds also good, doesn't it?
oh yes, it's larger look
but it's thinner in return
come here, you are covering the boomba
I am not sure, but the Bose has some hefty force
let's try this
and? what do you think?
sounds a little bit sizzling
let's try something else
too much bass? then tilt it back again
look, it immediately becomes less
let it like this
now this one has more bass
you can tilt it forward again
like this it doesn't sound that...
you know why it is tiltable?
because when it's standing on the floor
on the floor the bass is boosted anyhow
and when you tilt it back it emits nicely upwards
like this the bass is spot on, right?
but like this it's better
it's better? but well, outside there is no table
so something else
boom, what do you say?
let's listen to it from farther away at higher levels
come with me
so I'll turn it up a bit
do we want to hear how loud...?
in a moment, not yet, look, they are about...
wait, it has another dial at the back which you can turn even higher, look
we are not even at maximum
wow, look
volume is not even one third and already that loud
so watch out, I'll turn it a up a bit
the Teufel
it's nearly at maximum the other one
which one is now?
well the big one is playing, let's try another song
there you go
the Teufel is already at maximum
boom! we have to go even farther back, come with tme!
come, come, come... I will turn it up now
watch out!
this is maximum at the big boomba
the Teufel is also maximum, but well you cannot here much anymore
ho ho ho hoooo
let me see if I have another song
woaah!
boom!
you cannot here much from the Teufel
boah!
uaah!
boom, that's a... look, it is not much larger and how noisy it is
sure it loses bass, but the Teufel was not that much better
but how much did the bassboomba move?
I have no idea
ah, that's wrong, here it is...
I think we will have to go outside to test it properly
do you remember I have a similar one from Teufel, but that one is much larger, twice as big, it looks nearly the same.
we could compare these two.
daddy, what can you adjust with the first ones here?
this is also volume, and here it has an own bass and treble dial
and additionally an own reverb effect
this means if you sing...
so this is volume and this?
this is also volume
and this here?
for each channel there is an own volume dial
so let's turn this off and see what kind of shelf he sent us
and how loud will the other shelf be?
we will see
we willl turn this off
maybe just as loud or only a little?
I am not sure it is a shelf, it also looks like a speaker
I will put this here
but it is a shelf!
IKEA has shelves, that's true
let's open it and have a look
certainly a shelf
certainly not a speaker
or a shelf with a speaker
but since when does IKEA have speakers?
so, let's have a look at this
a cable
a shelf with a speaker
look, I knew it is a shelf, I think this is the shelf-mount
aha, it doesn't look like a shelf after all
really? what? oh yeah it is a shelf!
is it a shelf?
you can put something on top here, or here
sure?
here is some light
I think this is rather a grip, look you can also mount a grip here
please put the box aside, we don't need it anymore
can you remove it too?
we'll try it out
hey, it's in fact a speaker, look
funny, I wouldn't have believed
can this be removed?
no idea, we'll try it out
let me see, wait, wait wait...
like on an old radio, you can turn up volume
how loud is it?
not that loud, it is at maximum, thus slightly above half
but doesn't sound that bad
can I remove this?
wait, carefully, otherwise you will break something
yeah, I think it works
is this a shelf or a speaker with a shelf?
no, I think it is a speaker, look
you know what, bring the LG over here so we can compare a little bit
this one?
yes, please
it's also heavy, watch out
it's nearly as heavy as the Teufel
a bit lighter
but not much and look
just as heavy
so we can compare these two
if this one is loud or the other one
and which one sounds better after all
can you also place it like that?
yes, no you cannot, because here it has passive radiators
and, come over here, sit down and tell me which one sounds better?
and?
this sounds better
sure?
this one has so much bass
it doesn't have much bass
oh yes, true
this one sounds totally muddy
doesn't sound that special
let's try something else
so, now listen again carefully, sit down here at me, come here
you won't hear anything with one ear, you have to listen well
Sashi, concentrate now
well, I... this one sounds completely colored with mids
sss shhhh
you know, this costs less than half
this costs 70€, and this costs 200€
thus nearly 1/3 ha ha ha
no this... this,... sounds horrible I would say
and you really like this one more?
you prefer this one?
because the lights are flashing, right?
so let's turn them off, otherwise you get influenced by the lights
you probably have to press 5 times in order to turn them off
and now listen again, which one sounds better
this here, still this one
the other one, this sounds better
but listen, listen to the bass here
here is nothing
this one is clearly one class above this strange LG here
I will make it a bit softer
sounds a bit like a clock radio
let's make it louder again
this sounds like a clock radio
which one?
this one
this one sounds like a clock radio? I think this sounds like a clock radio!
no the other one
no, I don't think so
so come here, let's make them louder again
let's see which one is louder. this is a party speaker, so it should play really loud, come on, come on
so I'll turn this one to maximum
and now the IKEA - closet
and how loud is it?
this is both at maximum
so considering that...
where have you disappeared, kid?
what are you doing with the fingers inside the mouth?
considering that it's a party speaker, it's not very party-capable, I would have said
this should be a party speaker with all these lights and so on
so this IKEA doesn't sound that bad I think
or is this a party speaker?
no, it's not, a conventional speaker, look what else is at the back here?
look, it just needs the cable, no power brick nothing, you just attach the cable and you can charge it immediately
and here you can somehow mount it at the wall I guess
with special screws
and the grip could also be mounted
look, is there some key included?
over there, inside this...
of course
is there something included? let's try mounting it
daddy, do we want to use the party speaker for my birthday?
no, come on, it's not even loud enough
even your red one is louder
do you want to try it out? yes, bring over the red one!
it will certainly be much louder... where is the red one?
where is the red one?
dunno where you put it
I have an idea, I will steer the red one with my phone, and you the other one with yours
where is yours?
it must be somewhere here
have it!
but we need the same song
let me see
what do we have here?
maybe one out of here, which one do you like out of these, which song?
the first one?
roxy, can you please go down? down!
do you need to add bass?
well, if it becomes loud yes
wait, I will also search the same song and then we can both...
when i say stop, you stop and...
which one is it, this one right?
where does it play it now?
on mine
on my speaker
so, and now come along
now you can turn it louder
but you forgot to add bass, did you add it or not?
no!
now you make a break
now me
so, now I am at maximum on that big one
I have it at maximum
this is maximum?
let's fast forward slightly
now you stop
it's a muddy...
also slightly forward
now you can play again
this one's louder, yours is louder
so turn it down again
you can make a birthday party with yours, you don't need that huge one at all
apart from that your flashes just as nicely
so well...
quite nice this thing
mine doesn't play any tones when turning it off
only when turning it on
we will listen to it a bit closer
and now let's go to mum into the garden...
wait, we still wanted to mount the grip
or should we compare this with this one?
yeah... I think they sound similar anyhow
no, I think both sound a little bit... if this one is louder or this
I think this one is louder
it is particularly loud
for the size it's the loudest out there I think
so where is the grip?
you have to stretch it a little, so...
screw
then we can compare these two, if this is louder or that
I think without grip I like it more as it looks so minimalistic, just a simple block
daddy, can I make the other screw?
yes, you will make it, wait a little
daddy, do you need that thing at all? no!
because you already have one, don't you?
and you want to have it, or what?
so wait, I'll just put it in for you and you can screw it in, OK?
so, and now it's your try
the way you always screw something in, yes this way
carefully, watch out that you don't drop it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
