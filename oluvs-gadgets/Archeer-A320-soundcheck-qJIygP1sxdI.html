Archie a 320 summer 40s for this a
great-looking wooden bamboo speaker
which reminds me quite a bit of that
male gets together I think I'm not sure
how much they really share internally
but build quality and materials look
just equal just that the Archaea looks
like some shrunk version was just one
mover the male has two offers and also
different looking Twitter's
this is the newest and improved version
I know this because a friend of mine who
is also YouTube reviewer you can check
his channel look at his side which is
mini clang wounded a he got an older
version and which still had a little bit
of problems with frequency response he
gave Archie some suggestions how to
improve the sound and they improved it
so the sound you are hearing here has
some of his ideas included before having
a listen yeah let's have a look at the
packaging which is really very simple a
simple box but it comes with a nice
carrying bag so for transport you can
put it here and it will protect the
great-looking would also let's check
maybe some frequency response
measurements and you can see that the
speaker here may be thanks so that big
woofer in the center is all about bass
there is a huge bass boost between two
and hundred Hertz the overall frequency
response is rather balanced but you just
have to like bass in order to like the
speaker
yeah of course let's have a listen how
it sounds
as always I'm using high quality
binaural microphones so for best results
please use high quality headphones yeah
at the back you can see it's charged to
microUSB which is of course nice for a
speaker that big auxilary some reset
button volume button play but nothing
that special and I will play some tracks
from YouTube musician and YouTube
pioneer Kevin MacLeod first so let's
have a listen
yeah I think you can do it already here
I will increase volume slightly there is
definitely quite a bit of support noise
but we are not listening that loud but
you can really hear this noise and a
wasting or farting quite well let's try
another trick yeah also here makes the
speaker close to unlistenable
and another suggestions he sent them was
to close the port I have some some
building blocks from my son which are
out of foam and I made some kind of pot
plaque which will stuff in here which
more or less closes the port and when
measuring the speaker now with the pot
closed you can see that suddenly the
base which is deeper the sound simply
improves and we will get rid of this
ugly pot noise so let's have a listen
now with the port closed and you can see
and hear and it simply sounds better so
closing the port definitely improve the
sound and see
but according to actually it would be
too expensive to redesign the complete
speaker so the best solution is really
to stuff in some some cotton wool or or
yeah even I know some have closed it
completely with silicon but I would
definitely recommend to close it
immediately because it makes the sound
much better you still have this bass
book but the bass which is deeper now
and you get rid of some any any kind of
side noise yeah I thought we will
compare it against the popular TDK a34
which is quite a bit more balanced but
we can have a listen how these two
compare starting in with the Archaea and
another track from Kevin MacLeod I think
maybe you can hear that there seems to
be some some stair enhancing algorithm
included I will switch over to the K
yeah it sounds just flatter not
necessarily better but
I think that actually sounds really nice
despite their huge bass post also
because of the scare enhancing which
opens the sound quite a bit to decay
again
does it sound bad but not as exciting as
the RTM next I will play some tracks
from the great American group cap yak
again starting at the arch here to decay
sadly sounds cool and and boring
although there seems to be some kind of
dynamic process included which which
stops there I will increase volume
slightly to match the most
the care game sounds a bit more exciting
another trick from cap yak and maybe
let's check how loud they both can play
so I will get far away to get to avoid
any distorted noise from my recording I
will increase volume to maximum just
make them known attk also maximum there
is technique in order
I'm sure but you can hear that it sounds
quite proud to be kay
so you loudness wise no chance for the
Archaea but I think it still sounds
quite okay at maximum let's try maybe
the base Puma now both cost exactly the
same which is around hundred dollars and
so far I was quite impressed with the
base Puma so let's have a listen how it
compares against the Archie a320 I will
start again with the Archie and another
track from cap yak you can hear it's
very enhancing effect lay a base Puma on
more clothes
but the actual sounds of it as if
something the mix was missing clearly
thanks to their stellar processing
another base tumor
sounds quite different especially
compared against the opportunities to
hear that the sound is really I don't
know but maybe it even sounds a bit fake
in my ears I will again try playing them
at maximum so this is the optional
maximum volume light amount of
distortion already placed your mouth
although the base humor starts losing
quite quite some of its base it still
sounds a bit more convincing with less
distortion and also quite a bit louder
actually again yes maybe another crack
although you can really hear some nice
stereo sound stage H their base humor
cannot quite offer also a track from cap
yet they're based or doesn't have that
much base anymore but much more punch
somehow sort of it muted the our share
of all the stare is really impressive
here cause it depends quite a bit and
the position how I stand cut when
standing here it makes the sound really
really broad the base room is definitely
quite a bit louder let's let's have a
listen at slightly lower levels
I think the Archaea might even sound
better for low level listening
especially as it gives you this open
sound
and trying to match them volume rise
yeah I think it's a matter of taste but
Archaea sounds definitely quite a bit
more open also thanks to the standard
processing you get a great sound stage
usually missing from most singing
cabinets because so there are definitely
a great speaker $400.00 one of the
better ones I mean you'll probably even
liked it more than the bass Puma but
it's not as loud and starts to distort
quite a bit at maximum but you
definitely have to put in something into
the bass pod tool for best sound
otherwise it won't sound as great but
I'm really enjoying it and I even listen
to it against the Dali catch and somehow
with some tracks I prefer the Archie
this bass boost is correct here quite
interesting yeah of course I would have
preferred if maybe at Lola visit it's
okay when you have such a bass post but
at higher levels I would have toned it
down slightly or maybe try to extend
lower base more yeah but anyhow a great
speaker and better than many others for
this price I've heard I could even
imagine that it sounds better than the
male porn down I'm not sure I haven't
heard the matter just in a store and I
was quite impressed well rather
depressed how bad it sounded it was
really horrible the actual sounds quite
okay although you have to like this bass
boost I mean if you don't like it just
tone it down with some equalizer take
the whole area around 100 200 Hertz down
and it should be better so I hope I
could give you an idea about the Archaea
a 320 nice contender for the bass boomer
in exactly the same price for some maybe
even better thanks to this great open
Sun staging the bass boomer sounds a bit
recessed compared to the RG yeah again
some bikers both are included within the
database so listen there maybe with just
exactly the same songs with the speakers
placed centered you can maybe hear more
details
so thanks a lot for watching I hope you
liked it I hope you liked the music from
cap yak have a nice time and we'll see
you I will see you in the next video bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
