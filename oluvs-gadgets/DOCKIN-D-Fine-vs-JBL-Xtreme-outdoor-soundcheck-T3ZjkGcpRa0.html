test the docking design again I claimed
it to be the JVM extreme kala solo
tested against their JBL extreme but
this time outdoors outdoors the speakers
need to be much more powerful with more
bass otherwise the sound gets lost
within the space so we will play them at
maximum in see how they perform keep in
mind that docking defined called 214
years or a hundred twenty pounds it's
also a level on the British Amazon store
you can find the links in the
description of this video and as always
I will be using my head cam and our
microphones so please listen headphones
and let's check them out I will start
with the obligatory focus on track in
the JBL extreme first volume is around
two-thirds maybe and let's increase
volume to maximum oh yes some distortion
let's try the define places completely
clean extreme again
yes Alton is more covered and also
completely distorted here they're much
better base luggage life may be equal no
effect from Nigel good
we also hear that should you fall in
slightly you have to adjust if too much
is to get the clean sound otherwise it's
completely reported miss to define also
much better sound state from how it
sounds much bolder here
yeah nigga now track we have also here
lots of distortion compound
let's looking be fine you can hear that
bass is much fuller shady it again
no this one is rightly defined justifies
playing its maximum
his monocle next model in India some
chicks are completely distorted
I will go a bit far away neatly defined
let's not much pain or no disclosure at
all none effect these are subjects from
nocopyrightsounds
or really mustard heavily oh wow it
sounds like it was broken up a page you
can either define handles this easily
extend maybe 15 meters away no here the
punch here extreme from a low sexual no
copyright sounds can be learned this
isn't anything new that happens
whoa
a couple different they're much cleaner
no he posted for nothing
now you have to reproduce volume two
notches for careful
that's it
what's the local Pipestone and you
cannot handle this straight
yes antics range also visit from your
population from a profit community
it basically completely focused
bounce more like some effective
the editor night and day difference is
much cleaner phone also comes out lot
from on louder listen to the console
that based on minute let me see how to
perform effective jl also becomes more
muffled somehow
they held much cleaner I have to reduce
volume is not just in order to get a
clean sound
maybe last but not least some hard rock
track increases volume for Mexico again
really like I think you can hear it
yes unlistenable
very happy for you like this for them
you
yeah I don't think it looks quite sense
to compare any further the docking
defense really kills it I think it was
pretty obvious the docking define easily
outperform the JTA extreme even at
maximum and outdoors
you could hear much better sound
definition better bass no compression no
Distortion why the JB extreme release to
audit with these heavy tracks from
nocopyrightsounds you could hear this
strange bubbling with blue blue and
distortion so I'm really really
impressed this is some German no-name
company and they only have three product
on the market or four including these
earphones and this is the market leader
JBL so it's really impressive what
docking did here it's a nice body
speaker and maybe the only advantage of
the JDL extreme over the docking design
is a stronger battery I got five hours
15 out of the gym extreme X&amp;amp;Y the
docking design played for three hours
forty five so one hour and a half less
but still a great party speaker and I
think it's definitely worth 140 euros
and it might be the best in this class
I mean maybe Anna Harman Kardon on
Expedia sounds better but it will die
after half an hour at maximum much
larger you cannot put it into into any
luck sex because of the heat and
everything so yeah I hope my video could
give you a better idea about the docking
define how it really performs it really
what I would call a driving extreme
Keela it sounds better it's louder with
no Distortion yeah and it's cheaper so
why not like it thanks for the thumbs up
and thanks for the thumbs down not sure
why but I just try to yes to give you
the best and cheapest speakers available
so hope you liked it see the next video
have a nice time and bye bye
