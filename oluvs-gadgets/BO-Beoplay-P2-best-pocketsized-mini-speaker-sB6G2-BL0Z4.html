to check out the bangle dachshund do
play p2 a bit more in detail we've
already heard it in FB and Oscar maybe
you remember but in the meantime I
headed at home for several weeks and I
think I can state now that this is the
best pocket-sized mini speak I've ever
tried it's really small so it fits into
any pocket but still gives you this
mature full-bodied sound usually missing
from most mini speakers of course this
comes at the price hundred seventeen
dollars or euros is not cheap you can
definitely find bigger cheapest because
that sounds better than this but if you
need the smallest form factor with the
best sound currently on the market they
people seems to be the only one it's not
perfect though so pretty minimalistic
just has a USB C type charging port no
controls it has some internal volume
control so when controlling volume for
an iPhone or an Android there is no
problem but I had problems controlling
volume through this xiangning m1s the
speaker obviously remained at the last
volume step so I couldn't turn it louder
from from this device apart from that
mmm yeah it has some gimmicky touch
control so double tapping will start
music shaking will change track and so
on but it's sometimes the hasn't really
do you see yeah you can also turn it off
through the app and I don't want to go
more into details about how great it
looks and so on how great the design is
but the product concentrate on sound
will also listen to it compared to some
other speakers some nice because like
this JBL clip here but also because
because like the flip 3 and later on
also the a1 has many very interested how
it is to compare not before having a
listen let's check out some frequency
response measurements I measured it
directly on axis and 45 degrees off-axis
and you can see it has a slight smiley
response but the smoothness out and
listened effects is at low levels there
is some dynamic bass boost and the
speaker sounds really mature then at
higher levels base is reduced more and
more but still it manages to give you
the impression of a really big sound
even at maximum despite the small size
of course there is also net
you can tweak the sound so there is some
thought you can slide around and have
four corners warm excited relaxed and
bright and I tried to measure this as
well so with warm you get an upward
still towards base bright does exactly
the opposite boost treble we use base
excited takes out mid slightly while
relaxed boosts meets you can also
increase the size of the dot which would
make the sound more spacious but with a
mono speaker this results in a strange
response also Bengal dogs and decided to
take away they're still repairing
feature so there is no option anymore to
pair it with an r1 for stereo it remains
a mono speaker but still I think it
sounds really great
and I would like to demonstrate you this
of course you can also check it out for
my speaker audio database compare it
against two hundred different other
speakers but now I will take my head cam
like my Laurel microphones you should
grab your headphones and we will check
it out I will turn the Bo play p2 on and
first I would like to demonstrate here
what kind of sound you can usually
expect from most minutes because of
course this is much cheaper this is the
JBL clip and all the version but I think
it sounds even better than the newer JBL
clip - compared to the Bo play p2 it
sounds a bit ridiculous although really
not that bad actually I start playing
with the p2 and the song from soul
person and Princess Rita is instrumental
version so please have a listen
to JBL
yes and it's ridiculous compared to
their pain oh dal-su
possibly also try the difference in
loudness between both so the jvm clip is
already playing closer to medium this is
maximum volume with quite a bit of
compression the p2 also makes more now I
can hear much louder not really
comparable what we could do is compare
it against some highly rated speaker on
Amazon this is the un's angle 3 from
Cambridge Audio I think this one's even
worse than the JBL clip but people seem
to be quite satisfied with it and yeah
we should check out how this sounds
compared another song again starting
with the V 2 first
if our two worlds the same is not even
FM radio quality is just horrible
now of course they're tense angle is
much cheaper I think you know $30 per
film I would like to listen to music
with this also remember the p2 is an
omnidirectional speaker so it will sound
great from all angles there the one
thing is really one of the worst I've
heard still I don't understand all the
people who create this so highly what I
could do is of course try mixing volume
the entangle is extremely loud regarding
the size but it still sounds like crap
so to increase in volume to maximum
really hurt the people smothered loud
but remains nicely balanced and sound
just horrible
I think the p2 sounds more comparable to
the JBL flip 3 of course the JBL flip
fries also quite a bit cheaper maybe
half the price of the p2 but still
impressive what can be achieved always
pick up that small starting again with
their
we can also check lower levels where the
p2 has some dynamic sound adjustment
they flip three sounds a bit thin at
lower levels again increasing volume a
bit higher
we'll try to match them
analysis you can hear some very slight
vibration this is just because
Mendelsohn and storm over do their
processing but most because we will hear
their click three doesn't sound as
smooth
so this is really impressive performance
also keep in mind the only directional
sound from behind you can get more less
forget there 3 3
of course Lamas why's that people cannot
compete with the free free
so I will increase volume
- maximum football
much louder
maybe something from multiple girls
definitely not as long as they're
slippery
but because many have asked to compare
it against the HEI one who will do the
snow the a one being one of the best
portable compacts because around the p2
we'll have of course a hard time to
compete with especially as it's much
smaller but still I would like to show
you how these two Sun compared I will
start with some jazz pop all-school so
please have a listen
nah nah he's bitter just great one
cliff share the meat stuffing out all
the time not finish go to me is legally
No
community a one has much more bass or so
a bit more refinement to the sound but
fifty two sons fulfill Metro the vocals
come better to digital
of course it doesn't have this deep base
of very one so the people sounds like a
mini version of the a1 maybe being less
than half the size it's really quite
impressive something else here with
really each part bass and more powerful
recordings like this from some Poisson
process feature you will notice the
difference in bass response between
these two a bit better
the a1 has much deeper bass and much
more powerful bass I don't want anyone
not to as well here it cannot compete
with the a 1000 sound
so that's bottom list I would like to
compare it against a show me me
Bluetooth speaker which is maybe the
only mini speaker that can a little bit
compete with the pitot I will place the
show me me flop just like the p2 to make
them more comparable and now I'd like to
show you when the p2 can become a bit
uncontrolled toothpaste especially at
mid volume so please have a listen and
hear the bass drum sounds quite a bit
distorted the show-me plays this totally
clean
there is some maybe overdone processing
in the mid volume range this goes away
when you turn the speaker softer or we
can hear it drones
they're Xiaomi doesn't have this
full-bodied sound of their people but is
much more controlled somehow another
song can hear that this sounds much
cleaner although it's also much more
directional than their people so this
happens around half volume zone forty
percent up to sixty percent where some
songs can start to draw nor destroyed
let's write this house reckon this is
the bass run when I know it's horrible I
show me place this moment clean this
goes away at higher levels but here at
around fifty percent it's quite bad
actually but then when the bass starts
it becomes cleaning and so this is just
a matter of processing
because they show me also becomes a
little bit dirty
maybe another track result for some
first hand of misfortune here
I think you could feel the people sounds
really impressive and great for its size
it can even compete with ladders because
like the JBL flip 3 here which is no
slouch either there are biggest because
than this which sound worse still it's
not perfect as you could hear may be
some slight distortion at mid volume
levels bass becomes a little bit out of
control
you can tone it down by the app but
still also battery life is not the
greatest at maximum I didn't get 2 hours
out of it but I think it's still better
than a JBL clip which didn't even play 1
hour and a half while being much softer
if it's worth $170 yeah it's up to you
you can get a better video maybe with
the Xiaomi me it doesn't sound as great
or as loud as the people but it costs
just $40 so it's also a really great
speaker it cannot compete with the hey
won but it's also much lighter and and
smaller so I'm not sure if there will be
any other really small pocket sites
because better than this harman kardon
will issue the new traveler which seems
to be some successor model of the
Esquire Mini but the Esquire Mini
costing nearly the same price is a joke
compared against the p2 so I doubt the
new Harman Kardon traveler will be much
better Harman Kardon wada concentrates
on conference ii functions and so on but
sound wise they p2 will probably wipe it
still I'm quite interested to hear the
new Harman Kardon treble on and if it
will be released I will of course
compare it against a p2 currently my
wife is using it therefore I also took
this golden color as her - is also
golden so it's her speaker thanks to her
for lending it to me
I hope this was helpful for you I hope
you had a little bit fun and see you in
the next video have a nice time and
bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
