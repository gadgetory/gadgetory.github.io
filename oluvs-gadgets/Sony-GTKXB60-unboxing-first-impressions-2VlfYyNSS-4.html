evening but it was already too late to
record something I was just on my way to
work but I couldn't wait I couldn't
resist I had to do a short stop and
bring it here as I thought we'll do a
quick unboxing together and maybe you
can already have a first listen how it
sounds depending of the batteries
charged or not sony has released two new
big portable boom boxes the XP 60 and
the XP 90 the exponent is quite huge so
already comparable to a Sun box - this
is smaller but still has eight kilograms
but you can already find it for 300
euros so quite a bit cheaper than the
JBL boom box I would like to put it
against the JBL boom box in an upcoming
video but I have no idea how it sounds
how loud it is and so on so eight
kilograms versus five kilograms may be a
bit unfair but 300 euros versus 500
euros I think it becomes equal again so
yeah as always I will use binaural
microphones also head cam for this
immersive 3d sound kind of experience
please put your headphones up and let's
open the box I only had this screwdriver
in my car so let's hope it works with
this as well
yeah I think so so in contrast to the
old XP 7 and so on the new ones have a
better inside which is of course nice
sony claims fall in hours for the XP 60
or 3.5 hours at maximum yeah we will of
course test this as well I think you
have to pull it out like this charger is
obviously or the surplus power supplies
obviously included inside the speaker so
you just need this wire the pin box
needs an external charger
let's make it like this yeah here it is
unfortunately became a little bit windy
but you can maybe use this box as put it
down use a grip yeah I think it looks
quite nice is this notice a step down so
you have to grips one here one here you
can carry it around like this if you
little bit cheap here the buttons maybe
so you can see four hours or 3.5 hours
at maximum yeah it has to mean drivers
will choose Parenthood me too little
drivers here
I mean Twitter's so it would be
interesting how it works you can either
set it vertically or horizontally but
probably with no real stereo separation
so let me try to connect we are in
bluetooth pairing mode already where is
it
here it is GTX XP 60 I hope I won't
forget any of these parts here and
let's try a track I thought analog from
soul persona in princess freesia we can
maybe do some equalizer tweaking I'm not
sure if volume is insane
obviously not so I will increase volume
to make them here without extra bass
yeah there is no bass obviously this is
maximum and volume this Sony Music
Center and where you have some second
maybe let's put it the other way
doesn't really work obviously here this
airing with the air so I'm close to the
speaker maybe let's open music hmm yeah
and it's it tells me I should be close
to the speaker which I am so let's
restart the app again so I have to what
was the name XP no GTX XP 60 so back to
the app and nothing yeah this is really
doesn't really work that's right
maybe have to repair again
yeah okay and now the app should do
something yeah I have it here come on
okay so we cannot use the app obviously
so the Sony IP sucks
as you can see forget it
so we will listen just with the things
we have here
Oh
the sony maintains the sound quality so
there is no harshness I will just check
to get sure this is really mixing volume
so I cannot turn it any louder here what
else is here Ameena battery doesn't say
anything party chain function no but
this is Maxim phone on a speaker
strangely it's not synced with the phone
you wanna battle me you disrespect homie
just slide onto the pole I'm hot I'm I'm
digging my cried out break Rapids get
your shot take the size of times up
you better give me the mic when you
finish the flounce up I'm constantly in
my players like you messing your minds
up so yeah poor not not sure what to say
I mean it's loud but doesn't really
sound too impressive I would say there
doesn't seem to be any lower base let me
try a frequency generator I have here
and maybe let's check some some sign
tone
yeah 80
with 57 it already struggles so
obviously they let it roll off it below
80 Hertz to give it some yellowed Ness
yeah first impression is like this not
to impress to tell the truth but we will
have to pull it against the JBL boombox
maybe to hear if it's really if you can
really compete me I mean for 300 euros
maybe not that bad but so far I'm not
too impressed so I hope this was helpful
sorry for this wind and noisy here when
I came it was completely silent but yeah
it's always like this so still I hope it
was helpful a little bit and see you in
the next video where we will compare
them sony against the JBL boombox thanks
for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
