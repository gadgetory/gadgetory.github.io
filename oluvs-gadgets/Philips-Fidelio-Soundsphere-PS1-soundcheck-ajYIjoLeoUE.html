owner of the philips ps1 surrounds
because you can see here they are pretty
rare because they are still listed on a
fillip site with 3000 euros so not
really affordable but you can see the
design is pretty funky and they remind
me a bit of my own Philips on Swiss
because they follow the same design
concept of course this is a much more
higher class speaker and as there is no
single review or user review on YouTube
I thought you might be interested in
checking them out but first some facts
about these speakers yeah a two-way you
can see a floating Twitter here and
woofer main driver with bass reflex they
have apt X included for Bluetooth
training no Wi-Fi like my Santa speakers
but they have two HDMI inputs because
they rather act as a kind of surround
system they have virtual surround mode
and I thought we will check them out
with a movie also with some songs I
prepared I have some snippets of
different genres that we can play
through the speakers of course I have
nothing to compare them with but maybe
they will give you an idea how they
sound anyhow as always I will be using
my high quality binaural microphones
also a head cam the room is not very big
so we need this wide angle to really
have them covered inside the frame so
please put your headphones up and let's
check them out first let me check a
short movie sequence of Batman vs
Superman to hear how they render the
movie
that's increased volumes lightly
and they have an own surround mode let's
turn this on also a movie mode I'm not
sure if this is already yeah this is
already active
he's like another
I want you to get everyone out of the
building right now
turn us around again
I'm not sure there is that much
difference
in surround on
yeah obviously no sub wolf and he did
let's check let's switch over to
bluetooth let's check some music and I
will start with a level around half
maybe an acoustic jazz track although I
don't know if we have surround enabled
now so I will switch off surround and
turn on music mode
another just wreck or something
let's increase volumes lightly
in our Trek Russian just spent on key
business again let's try so long again
maybe there is some slight delay between
left and right shall not short around
off again but it becomes louder it may
be slightly more treble hello
against around it sounds a bit more
spacious
Serrano finger
and software of course maybe we should
meet the son I don't know
again
they're pretty punchy responds down to
about thirty Hertz maybe this distortion
is already recorded in the track so the
speaker's made a spin
render orbit
yeah last but not least a drum and bass
track yes the neighbors will probably
come complaining
they're all so far migrates here I will
switch off surround again
I'm not sure which mode I prefer
yeah I think they are pretty cool sound
is impressive also design is great if
you are rather into this more unique
sci-fi approach but not sure if really
worth 3,000 euros for 3000 you can get a
pair of devilish speakers which probably
will have an edge especially in power
and loudness but still a really decent
pair of speakers meanwhile I think they
are even discontinued maybe there will
be a new model coming from Philips but
if you can get them for cheaper
somewhere yeah why not if you really
like this form factor there is nothing
that speaks against it except the price
I hope you like this video I hope you
found this helpful
yeah a short soundcheck of the Philips
ps1 so thanks a lot for watching and we
will see us in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
