between the FUBU XL and the JBL extreme
if you haven't seen my previous endo
comparison please have a look at this
first this time we would like to
concentrate more on sound outdoors how
they perform how loud they can play and
so on first I thought we would like to
simulate some kind of situation where
you sit around we are friends the
speaker is placed in the center to show
you how everyone will hear the sound I
will place the speaker's here and then
listen to them from some of these places
of course I will be using binaural
microphones so you should listen with
headphones for the best results sorry no
classics this time but I will be playing
some EDM tracks with the first from
continuum called eternal echoes so
please put up your headphones and let's
have a listen as usual I will start with
the fugu XL first
and back to from where we started that
circle is closed now and I think it was
pretty clear that the 360 degrees
Santa's version of the for Excel worked
pretty well to entertain everyone
sitting around the JBL appeared maybe a
bit more punchy but everyone sitting
behind would rather only get bass so I
thought we will do the same now with me
wearing a head cam and switching life to
see how they compare I will turn the
full XL to maximum it's still in normal
mode the JBL extreme is matched volume
wise so it's still quite a bit below
maximum I will start with the XL first
and then walk around there is quite a
bit of distortion already
I will come back give you extreme for
Maxim's well now you still have this
ramp up but I think you can hear that
this big wave cell is quite a bit lower
in overall volume especially in normal
mode
I will try turning on outdoor mode there
is still quite a bit louder let's try
not attract yeah the difference is
pretty obvious
yeah we still have this ramp up it's
quite hard to judge the loudness
difference if the speaker becomes louder
after some time some DB louder the group
of which
there from behind there is not much on
there JBL let's try another trick again
I'm using two I forced to switch as I
thought it would be easier to avoid this
ramp up but when it isn't I will go away
a bit further to see how they perform
from some distance
loofa which is still there
but the JBL is simply quite a bit louder
so for all the party yes I mean the
difference is not huge but the punch you
get from the JBL is yeah extreme maybe
therefore the name let's try not attract
again from savasana the Blue Ridge is
starting to fade on both I will come
closer again
I cannot avoid this ramp I'm sorry but
you also hear that there is quite a bit
of distortion already on the story
itself
I mean the JBL doesn't sound that great
for maximum you hear it sunsets are so
but well or making some noise because
it's pretty good I think
yeah maybe we should try to make a more
controlled comparison I will try setting
up something I thought we could prepare
a controlled sound pressure level
metering with the speaker's slightly
elevated standing on a bench and the
microphone exactly one meter away I will
use see waiting and play this because
one after the other do the switching in
post-processing so you can hear and see
which one is louder and by how much I'm
standing one meter behind the measuring
microphone which is two meters away from
the speakers both because we'll be
playing at their maximum volume with the
Fuji excel in auto mode I will start
with the few Excel first
yes
so yeah I hope you liked this video I
hope it was helpful I think it was
pretty clear that the food work cell
couldn't quite compete with the JBL
extreme loudness wise we've also seen it
in the sound pressure level metering but
you could maybe also hear that the JBL
was already struggling a bit with the
dance track their bass drum started to
bubble a little bit whoop
look why the FEU XL despite having some
tendency to distort sounded more
convincing with these tracks still the
JBL extreme has their more pumping sound
outdoors the huge bass boost is
definitely an advantage while the deeper
bass response of the fugu XL gets a
little bit lost outdoors indoors I would
definitely choose the full XL you also
don't need these high loudness levels
and I personally like the 360 degree
sound dispersion a lot if you're out
with friends simply put the speaker in
the center and everyone will get great
sound while with the JBL you should put
it somewhere aside because it only
sounds great from from front still for
really making some noise both will not
be enough I mean you will need a bigger
speaker like the IVA XS 9 I already
prepared some videos about that Lexus 9
it costs the same still I mean it's
larger it's also heavier but for making
output party outer event the IVA XS 9 is
much better than both of these yeah I
think this was it I will probably
prepare some other videos of the few
excel when some new speakers arrive I'm
waiting for the library tones e-mini
currently also a 360 degree speaker and
we've claimed 60 watts of amplifier so
it might be interesting but it's not as
recline in this is a rack model you can
drop it and nothing happens you can put
it underwater and nothing happens the
library turns if is more a multi room
still may be interesting so next video
will be probably fugu XL versus live
return zip mini so stay tuned for this
thanks for watching and we will see us
in the next video have a nice time and
bye bye
