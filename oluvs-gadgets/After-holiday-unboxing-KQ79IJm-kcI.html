lots of messages have a right to
holidays it's so hot outside I don't
want to open them all I don't want to
bother you but here is something from
polypro the c3 and the drum fire so I
want to concentrate on these this way I
don't know what's inside boxing and
maybe some first listening
connected butyl know the difference I
think to be alt T 3 is that is what I
find also it can be set up as a madam
system to go with the vampire and name
let's try the first rack
although prepare for what I know there
are also base and phone controls
available yet so it's really hot outside
I would prefer to stay in the pool now
okay
so I think
takes a like just we just
never of this subwoofer yeah sorry it's
so hot I have to jump into the pool
I hope this was enough as a first
impression and unboxing of the Equator
customer service what is 90 box tone
become a nickname emphasis claim is here
so you have asked Lana cinema meatiness
instead okay so really interesting
speaker quite meaty sound yeah
also great-looking with this faux
leather finish him also quite
interesting with two different parts
subwoofer yeah sorry I have to you can
see there are lots of many other
packages I don't even know these inside
maybe let's open just one for for the
consumer studies but it's definitely not
as interesting I also like the the c3
you can connect them for for a home
system this one again so can hear the
difference in sound
nice
making what it brought back so give me
some time I also want to do a review of
the driving X X boom first that already
showed you some short teaser this was
this one quite a great
it's and
each was very work if we try again yeah
when you have so many Bluetooth you Isis
so I will try to make a full evil son
until then stay tuned I hope you like
this and see you then have a nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
