look at the tube and from Stella's audio
maybe remember a British company
I already presented you that ns-one in a
three parts because from them and they
also have other products within their
portfolio so digital radios on this this
is the MM 30 HD a hybrid vacuum valve
amplifier it has two times 30 watts of
power brutal force here with EDX and a
DAC which supports high resolution on
you so you can connect your PC through
USB do also lining phone in and so on it
comes in a flat box like this so you
have to market by yourself you can see
it comes also with some gloves a brush
and even a microfiber cloth as it's
really prone to fingerprints you can see
the tube or valve you have to mod it by
yourself I've never done this so I was
really careful and on top comes a nice
protector which will also have to screen
by yourself but this goes up a little
bit flimsy and last but not least you
need to mount the Bluetooth antenna then
the sturgis M is ready to go so let's
turn it on but first I'll take the graph
here is otherwise you will really see
everything a print the material is quite
delicate so we'll probably get yourself
clean it all the time also it will rush
him quite sweet it will take about 20-30
seconds to warm up
I only twelve as a headphone amp for my
Sennheiser HD example and it sounded a
bit smoother than from an iPhone but the
difference was not that huge
the trebles sounded a little bit nicer
maybe but it was not a night and day
difference I couldn't really say which
one sounded better but let's switch over
to bluetooth and - let's try it through
some speakers here I have my vintage
count on 920 DC that IO represented some
time ago I think they're quite decent
also quite a flat response and ever
start song always I have to wear this
gloves here
nice move all that here
and above he's looking really nice
especially with the darker room
we already have what I know this having
flat ball no because it's not shifted so
when I'm in for mode I get some sad
noises so you have to keep their phone
far away apart from that you can see in
sounds quite nice but I'm not sure if
there is really that much difference to
a traditional and I have my vintage
pioneer what is it when a heavier a 207
are also maybe twenty years old and I
thought yeah let's listen to both I will
do this as a blind test so I want to
tell you which one is playing trust a
and a and B and the D variant I will
resolve this but I don't want to
influence you so let's maybe discuss in
the comments if you had some difference
so I would set it up also measure levels
as close as possible get instead of
streaming for Bluetooth because my name
doesn't agree I will take their shiny in
one and streaming for the Fulani I think
this is quite a nice headphone output
also very very strong much louder than
the iPhone and it would be fair because
I could maybe go inside here from the
computer to the DAC with high resolution
audio but then of course this will sound
worse so put up your headphones if you
have it already and let's have a listen
just go
so what do you think did you hear any
difference I have not quite sure so
maybe let's discuss it with anaconda but
this density and high Saluki em then my
old one here not quite cheap but
currently discounted on the Amazon in K
store for 399 pounds usually it's more
expensive so not for an average job but
rather for a real horrify lover who
likes to paint around with brushes and
cleaning all the time yeah I like it
also feature wise just connected to a
computer through DAC and you have high
resolution area but I'm not sure you
will really hear it maybe you can try it
once common sight with USB and play some
high resolution audio files and then do
the same for Bluetooth but I already did
a test like this and there was hardly
anyone who had a difference so I hope
you liked this little introduction into
the ml 13 HD not cheap but great-looking
and also nice something so thanks all
for watching and see you in the next
video have a nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
