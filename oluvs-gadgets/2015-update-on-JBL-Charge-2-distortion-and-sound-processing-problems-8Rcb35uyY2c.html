JBL charge to
distortion issues that the speaker
suffered from the very beginning the
reality is that the very first units
that were shipped maybe even during the
first three months had quite severe
distortion and DSP processing problems
meanwhile JBL seemed to have fixed most
of the issues so if you get a new unit
the distortion should be gone my unit is
from the JBL outlet store I bought it as
refurbished a version for 99 euros
instead of 149 and compared to the first
unit that I had it's really better
distortion has gone now with bass-heavy
tracks you don't hear the scratching
sound anymore but it still sounds a bit
strange at lower levels on iOS devices
volume control is mirrored between
speaker and player you only get 16
visting volume steps and cannot set
something in between maybe on android or
other devices you could set the speaker
to the maximum and the player lower to
overcome the DSP processing issues I'm
not sure if this really works but first
I would like to show you how the
distortion sounded on my old unit that I
had compared to the new refurbished one
especially have a listen at the bass
drum how it distorted before and how it
sounds cleaner much cleaner now
waking up to a greedy world yeah rich
ones living off the board never have to
just born and more I want people
actually check it out how to go about
how the more valid questions and now I
would like to show you how the DSP
processing affects the quality at lower
levels compared to the same song played
at higher levels for this comparison I
will play the track at the second or
third volume step which is quite a low
volume but it's enough for a low level
listening it's at an office or even at
the bedside or something and then I will
play the same song met with matched
levels afterwards at half volume so that
you really hear the difference
you
I hope I could clear up some things as I
think the JBL charge too is still one of
the best sounding speakers on the market
right now in this price range so if you
are interested just be sure to get a new
unit from a newer batch I'm not quite
sure why JBL went for some kind of
camouflage tactics because there are
definitely enough old units on the
market still available maybe you even
could contact JBL support what's going
on here but the newer units despite not
being quite perfect are much better than
the very first units that had really
severe Distortion thanks for watching
and let's see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
