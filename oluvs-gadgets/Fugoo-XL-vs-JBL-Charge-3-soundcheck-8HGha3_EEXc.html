that JBL charge 3 against the fugu excel
so I would like to cover this with a
quick video playing some tracks and so
on I also thought it was pretty obvious
that they charge 3 despite being decent
cannot quite compete with the food excel
which is in a higher class I mean it's
bigger more expensive and the tuning is
really impressive it's not perfect but
anyhow more comparable to a speaker like
the Harman Kardon go in play as always
I'm using binaural microphones you
should listen at headphones for the best
results and the very first time I would
like to play a track from myself which I
did well more than 20 years ago so it's
not a very good recording but well why
not this is the same track I'm using for
the intro of my videos I will start with
the flu XL first
three
I think er can hear that there Foucault
Excel sounds bigger also bass sounds
much deeper and that level has this
slide
sizzling character not very clear
and our track not from me also here very
nice sound stage something the charts we
cannot quite offer it sounds a little
reset here this sounds much more serious
let's try something else but from soul
persona
let's try this I mean it sounds decent
for the size but that Excel definitely
sounds bigger so much more depth to the
sound gives you some kind of 3d effect
it's not something else
and now listen here
but I had the sense a little bit
let's write this do use some lower base
with the base from some reverb the
charge stream definitely doesn't reach
that be
and our track of course a great feature
of my to excel is that it has 360 degree
sound also better treble dispersion the
charge-free
definitely it becomes a little bit
muffled from behind or from high angles
I will increase volume to maximum you
really hear that people bass notes here
the track 3 as well
the full place in normal mode now it
would become a bit longer with outward
let's try maybe a rock
we could try turning on outdoor mode and
it should become louder now
we're still
becomes
also it's ridiculous against myself
you can hear some some facts definitely
make a quick selfie
it's whooping some punch of Mexican here
and title later
you noticed I used the fool Excel
without jacket because I think this
jacket design is a bit of a fail it
compromises the sound too much and makes
the speaker unnecessary big so I
definitely prefer it completely without
jacket and as long as you don't toss it
around it should work pretty well I mean
the passive radiators shouldn't damage
much and the Twitter's have protection
here also the main drivers it's still
wet from the bath it took together with
the mega boom so yeah I mean the charge
3 is a nice pickup but the food works so
it's definitely nicer more serious
sounding louder a bit too much
distortion for my taste at higher levels
but still outdoors you won't notice that
much of it if it is thoughts or not
there is so much Indian noise yeah I
hope this was helpful to give you an
idea about these two speakers if you
have the money yeah I would go for the
full XL but the charge 3 is definitely
the smaller and more more convenient
speaker to carry around equally a rugged
and and waterproof with equally great
battery life both so to give you more
than 6 hours at maximum I think I
measured the Fukui XL with 6 hours and
40 this gave me 6 hours 15 minutes but
yet the full XL is definitely louder
also with deeper more punchy sound yeah
so thanks a lot I hope this was helpful
and see you in the next video bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
