we'll do some smacking some ear linking
and some ear penetration of course I was
only kidding but it's still frightening
how much channels on YouTube and they
really seem to make great money out of
it with lots of views a really good
artificial head or maybe let's call them
artificial years cost thousand or
several thousand dollars upwards of
course mine was not that expensive I
cannot afford one like that but I wanted
to buy it for experiments also maybe for
future tests is a more stationary
solution so they don't need to wear the
microphones by myself but so far I'm not
really satisfied with the results the
microphones themselves are quite good so
there is a low noise floor so frequency
response seems nice but inside the ears
there is lots of ear canal resonance
there is a peak at 5 kilohertz so
without utilization they sound
completely off I already tried to
equalize them but I'm still not quite
satisfied and I thought we'll have a
listen how this sound compared to my
usual traditional pseudo binaural
recording technique which doesn't have
maybe this great imaging so for some
more up and down localization here is
also quite hard but the sound is much
more lifelike with my traditional setup
I think I thought I will place it on a
tripod and first we'll have a listen to
my philip celsius because when listens
to my normal binaural microphones and
then through these ones and later on
will maybe do another test so we can
here is the positioning works if you can
localize the sound source so yeah please
put your headphones up and let's check
them out
so here we are and we can all get a
little bit of a better 3d starts please
see in this room for example if I take
this piece of plastic here you can maybe
use if it's coming from above or from
below from there behind or left this was
already quite easy with my previous
recording setup but we are again it is a
harpoon ship so now I am a literal hair
cutter don't really make much sense but
in case your HIVs assume that those
artificial yes you should also get some
nice from an ethical position for
example the UPS that I'm opening the
door here at the bed you can hear the
church bell and now I'm going exactly to
the better of you so I'm standing at the
back side I was going to your idea and
yes of course it only works if these use
are similar to yours and that's why I
thought we'll do a test how great this
localization really works a simple setup
I will take the aft facing key and place
it on different locations like for
example here I would play NL + o Kesava
and you will ask you tell me which one
is currently playing I will start with
the outermost to the right so you know
speaker a is 1 and then speaker BCD you
need to renumber them yeah I hope this
works we are not sure if it's easy or
not but we will test it out so let's get
started
so we send you this work for you of some
kind of up-down localization so is it
possible to the room into space if I
place the search box on the corner or
bring closer to you you can definitely
hear the exchange in sound then I'm not
satisfied with the sound quality these
artificial use are giving me with a
localization they sound completely off
lots of resonance in the 50s region I'm
not sure about other artificial ears or
heads like those from free diode if they
are tuned for a flat response I guess
not so for really critical recordings I
would probably stick with my usual
pseudo binaural recording setup is these
are really tuned for a very flat and
very realistic sound
I tried treating them as well but I
don't get the same feeling and getting
with my usual setup so I tried comparing
headphone sound with the original sound
and my usual recordings are much closer
to this without this great localization
of course so no up and down and probably
back I thought about using this for a
more stationary setup maybe some high
fives because or even sound about usual
ensembles where you need a better
localization so yeah this was it I hope
you liked it anyhow maybe we should
start some donation campaign for a real
artificial hit from no man or from
brilliant career but they cost ten
thousand dollars upwards and I'm not
sure we will find as many donators
I'm glad if someone still donates me for
my database and everything but it's
probably impossible to collect seven
eight thousand dollars which the moment
kayuu 71 I think would cause I think
this one sounds is the best-selling one
except military data more technical ones
like those from clearly on to brilliant
brilliant clear some some Danish or some
that company I'm not sure but these are
these are pop I mean still I'm trying to
give you as great results as possible
within my limits so I hope you
appreciate this thanks out for watching
and see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
