at two premium Wi-Fi in years the moon
drop Kenna's Pro and not Kansas chemists
and their nature sound in his five dream
bridge really interesting names you can
find both on any express round hundred
seventy eight hundred eighty dollars so
already quite expensive therefore it
would be interesting to know if they
really justify this high price tick and
if they really perform that great there
was again created some hype around the
moon drop tennis pro by some particular
reviewers I knew it before I requested a
sample yeah already last year but it
took some time to arrive and the ns5 was
recommended to me again by John yang I
think they are quite comparable not only
price-wise but also sound wise and later
on we will check how they perform if
they really sound that great but first
let's have a look at the packaging moon
drop is usually quite minimalistic
inside is this open this is this
carrying pouch which is little bit too
small I would say you can see the Y is
already quite thick some additional tips
white ones this time not that many like
with the NS 5 you can see comes with a
completely precious packaging I cannot
read a word but the driver is particular
coated chrome whatever I don't know
both single driver designs so no multi
driver madness here you open this how to
open like this here comes also with this
carrying box inside are really many many
tips where are they I think I put them
in somewhere else and the problem is
both do not sound really great with the
original stock tips I mean it depends a
lot on your ear on how deep you place
them inside on the form of your ear
canal and so on but I was quite
disappointed with both to tell the truth
I would like to show you how they sound
with the original tips so first maybe
the moon drop canis Pro I will play a
single song from so Poisson process
freedom and you can have a listen
is it just to treat my loving inside my
fantasies come to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you
we can't
yeah both sound a little bit weird with
this recording it appears even more
exaggerated it's maybe not that extreme
but with the canis Pro I cut this very
strange piercing resonance at around
1011 kilohertz really horrible and I got
it with the NS 5 as well maybe let's
have a look at some measurements the
moon drop can explode in green the NS 5
in blue and both compensated for the
ears diffuse field target and you can
see both measures similarly the canis
Pro has more bass or some own upper mids
but both have this strange peak at 11 12
kilo Hertz this peak shifts depending on
how deep you insert them as you get a
closed system which gets a resonance at
half the wavelength so depending on how
deep you insert them the shifts either
to the left or the right but like this
they are both unlistenable to me you
could hear also the ears when the ears
yeah they are called is not only my ears
these years they sound a bit weird
therefore I started to experiment a
little first with the kennis prom I got
the best results with the Sony image one
tips the biggest ones I put them on put
them in like this not too deep so I
rather have a shallow insertion but
rebel was too harsh then therefore I put
in some foam I will show you on another
one as I don't want to ruin my my my mod
here because it's not easy to get it
right so what did I do
I took a piece of this foam I think this
was some inland in a packaging of some
transmat speaker I don't know very thin
one millimeter a piece like that you
have to experiment with the right I fold
it two times then I pull it inside here
if it goes inside yeah
stuff it in a little like this and it
stays inside so you don't have to sweat
tips just leave them like that and the
wonder of canis Pro improved a lot
it's not perfect but it's listenable
before it wasn't the same goes for the
NS 5 I looked quite a lot for the
perfect
tips and I got stuck with the cab 14 or
tips the biggest ones they're quite big
so you can see I think bigger than this
sony image one no not really
but I had a hard time to get there in
his five ride I tried really all kind of
tips mhm one tips some other ones I had
for Miss Ida it became too muddy to too
covered or treble became simply too
harsh but with the cab or in or tips and
also the same phone mod they sound nice
and I would like to show you again how
they compare now because now they are
both reasonable but they definitely
differ a little bit in sound I think the
moon drop is relative and more
mainstream sound maybe while the the NH
5 probably suits more for audiophile
lovers who want to hear all the details
I mean with the stock tips no both are
not usable for me maybe it just made
years I'm not sure but with this mod I
think both ok
and later on we'll also check the
measurements what change it or change it
what changed
I will play again the same tracks or the
same track some further tracks switching
back and forth so you hear the modded
version now and at the end and at the
beginning will always hear the original
track just for you as a reference to
know how it should sound and later on
we'll check some measurements and I will
give you my resume so let's have a
listen
is it just to treat my loving me inside
my fantasy come to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you
am i searching you I wanna feel
I think you'd hear after this mod they
sound really nice I mean still not great
or not top-level but they are quite
usable much better than many others for
this price range
I knew you won or whatever what was this
the dmg bheegi bheegi whatever so this
is way way better way more natural mmm
the chemists broad has some more fun
tuning with a lil bit more bass emphasis
the little bit more maybe presence
emphasis why the NS 5 has more mids
really quite a flat bass response
although this mod also reduces lower
treble a little bit so it depends it's
not perfect but I think it's way more
listenable like this you're sure to do
your own own experiment for me this is
how I can listen with them because with
the original tips all of them and there
are really many different kinds small
ones big ones strange-looking ones I'm
not sure where I put them but the only
ones that worked in my case were the
keyboard in your tips
the biggest ones with an additional form
inside so let's have a look at the
measurements with modding first the
Canis prom this is original and in dark
green the modded one and you can see we
managed to reduce this peak at 11 kilo
hertz but also introduced some dips at 2
kilohertz 5 6 kilo Hertz but I think
yeah this is the price you have to pay
for a more reasonable treble let's look
at the NS 5 now this is again original
and this after the mod also here we
reduce this treble peak made travel a
little bit fuller but introduced some
tips between 2 and 3 keywords and also
reduced up a meat a little bit i will
overlay both moderate measurements here
for the NS 5 and for the kinase prom and
you can see the connects probe has more
bass no treble but the overall response
is quite similar yeah I mean they are
great if you work a little bit with them
if you find the right tips it was not
easy so it took me some hour
to really try put them in and then yeah
also John John gave me the hint with
trying some some foam inside he's not
that fond of my ns5 mode he says it just
works well with the smaller image one
tips and what you also add in show you
you'll have to be careful not to put the
tips up to the very end just to the half
with the ns5 this makes the insertion
depth even shallower so if you put it up
for the very end and this changes the
sound again too much it's not a problem
with the with the moon drop here the
tips are you can see there is some
marking so they are more less at the end
while with the ns5 they have to be at
around half with the cavity no tips it's
not a problem they stay in like this
also both model is the same comfort wise
also the wires are I think even the same
whether make this quite nice just don't
deep don't put them too deep inside they
rather ask for a for a shallow insertion
I think like this they are both quite
nice
I prefer personally the NS 5 it's
somehow more revealing the the moon drop
can a sprawl is a little bit too
mainstream
- it's not base heavy but it's it's a
little bit more rough sounding to me
yeah nothing has to say I mean it's up
to you if if you are willing to spend
one hundred seventeen hundred eighty
dollars and for this price you can get
the automatic er three with some
additional input impedance adapter it
blows all of them away if you are after
a natural sound not a more sounded one
now the Matic released there or air
releasing the er-2 how do you ordered
one from mass drop you can find out a
measure of $450 it's also dynamic driver
I wonder how it compares against the ER
three or ef4 that I have I order the
Excel version as I like a little bit
more
bass John or that the SE version so
maybe we can talk a little bit later but
the difference will be just two or three
DB more base for the Excel version so I
think I mean they are okay but I'm not
sure if it's really worth spending that
much money
yes I personally I even would take a
modded image one over the canvas pro
trinket for maybe ten dollars mod it and
I think it sounds better than this
it doesn't have this strange peaks here
I think it's due to to design both have
obviously the same tuning or similar
tuning the sony in years they mask this
somehow or shift this maybe let's
overlay the sony image one here just for
comparison this is of course unloaded
and you can see it has of course way
more bass than the other tool compared
to the ns5 that's nearly 10 DB 8 DB or
something it has more response than both
mode at once at 7 kilo hertz a little
bit flatter here at 3 4 kilohertz and
treble is similar with a peak and not
such a strong peak like like this I mean
these are already modded and Mali to cut
this 1015 DB peak or whatever so I can
recommend them if you are willing to to
experimental II with tips I mean the
tips may be 50 60 % of the of the tuning
is related to the tips if you have the
right ones let's see 30 % your ear 30
percent the tuning of the in-ear and 30
percent the tips and then you either get
the sound right or not but the tips are
really on a really really important part
of of an Indian sound therefore I like a
thematic so much you pull it in and
don't care about any any tips you just
have to be sure to to use the big ones
the big 3 flange but here depending on
how deep you insert them how how far you
put the tip on
the child the song changes too much I
think they are both not tuned that well
especially because of this peak the
image one doesn't have this peak also
one driver design the NH one has too
much bass but this can be reduced by
modes so yeah this was it for the moon
drop highly regarded highly praised moon
Club tennis pro F I mean it is it is
okay but I'm not sure if it's read that
much better than many other cheaper ones
I have some problems it's thicker than
the than the end it's 5 so it sticks out
of the ear a little bit still
comfortable but I mean I mean it's ok I
don't feel it uncomfortable in any way
but if you don't work yeah for those who
own it please tell me do you get the
sound right with the original tips or
did you put in put up something else
because with the original ones I cannot
live with this strange it's really
resonant maybe I just don't care I'm not
sure but but it's really there and you
could also hear it from the measurement
that it's not that normal sounding yeah
this was really it thanks all for
watching I think this was this will be
my my last in-ear review because I'm not
that satisfied with this with this
solution it doesn't represent the sound
so close as I would have liked so I will
stop I covered everything every yeah all
India's I had at home and this is this
is probably it for for my in-ear reviews
I'm expecting the automatic er tool I
probably won't record it just give you
my thoughts about it how it compares
against the ER for which is my
absolutely favorite in here if I want to
listen to music and not just yeah but if
I really want to listen to music I take
the ear for exact these are just an
excuse me
to not want to stuff it inside but they
are not in clothes regarding everything
regarding
response regarding detail retrieval
regarding speed or whatever I mean I
don't care about the soundstage
soundstage yeah the soundstage is still
a thematic renders it how it was
recorded and not though some like we had
with the e8 you can open the dot
suddenly the Sun stage increases but
this is fake it was not recorded the
automatic place just doesn't enhance
anything
it sounds really true this sound may be
a little bit broader but I still enjoy
the sound way more with the ER for exact
impaired to these yeah nothing else to
say thanks all for watching and see you
next year bye bye
