the forest in order to hide myself from
wind a little bit I hope it will work
out and I also brought the JBL boombox
and the sony GTX XP 60 both a pretty
recent releases the JBL costs around 500
heroes here the sony can be already
found for round 300 although both are
not really that portable the JBL weighs
around five point two kilograms the sony
8 kilograms although and bringing them
here I didn't notice that much
difference in weight what I thought it
would be interesting to hear them which
one is louder which one sounds better
and so on so far I was not that
impressed with the GBL it can play quite
loud but becomes really harsh at high
levels while the sony sounds rather
muffled booming it's probably louder but
yeah so let's have a listen as always I
will be using my pen or microphones also
a head cam for the most immersive 3d
sound experience you should of course
listen with headphones so put them on
and let's have a listen
the JBL is said to endure which gives
you this nice longer bass kick why the
sony will be playing with extra bass
enabled and i also said the equalizer to
R&amp;amp;B EDM is the default setting but i
think it's a little bit muffled R&amp;amp;B is
better I also tried custom EQ but it
doesn't really help that much
overall the speaker is quite muddy but
we can maybe try some of these settings
I will set it back to R&amp;amp;B also keep in
mind ya next out the volume on the phone
and keep the volume rather low here if
you do the opposite it loses all bass
despite the extra bass button these
people setting seems to be bond to the
volume level of the speaker also another
thing you have to keep away from the
stamina button maybe you noticed it in
my unboxing video I pushed it at the
very end and suddenly it lost all bass
so yeah no stamina here but let's try
analog from some person I'm princess
Frieda first and the Sony will be
playing off
volume is around 60% so if this is AMD
let's write flat but if you hear next a
little bit of clarity this is my custom
cure also must be that much better most
impressive sound let's say exactly the
opposite way too much trouble but all
the lower base is much nicer here both
don't sound right if you make smaller
speaker so we can we have the entire
volume range here it takes a while
they're not sure why they didn't me
wrong volume here to that phone but you
can hear like this there is no bass so
you really have to keep the volume as
low as possible on the speaker and keep
it max on the player so you can increase
in volume slightly way cool treble heavy
the son
subscribe me and body
so stepping back with Nevada and
increasing volumes of mixing in the JCL
night and the way around eight
Mississippi
this one is especially louder but also
somehow igneous sounding
quite punchy but only some meat and Papa
bass tracks
yes Mitch and Trevor let's check them
off a tree slightly off a preacher so
they should anything sound quite nicely
to the side
do not sound right the only thing you
could try is adjusting their utilizes
something that's maybe yet
the only thing we could do is set the
GPL to outdoor but this will get rid of
this nice lower base so let's see how
this one's so and way too much play
somehow but not great base just some
mess some marsh I will turn off this
extra base
I think a mix of both would be nice the
treble on the JBL
Washington thought
completely lost despite awesome Oh
I would like to try indoor again as I
think this has a nice uh base the auto
mode becomes also quite balmy but maybe
not boom enough so at least with indoor
you get some nice lower base I think you
both are rather disappointing the JBL
would have a nice base but it cannot
keep up at high levels and pushes meat
and travel way too much while the sony
sounds like some cheap portable PA
system those big speakers you can get
four hundred dollars
so yeah both are not really that great
at mid levels the JBL definitely sounds
nicer but also way too much treadle the
Sony again way to muffled I already
adjusted the equalizer the custom EQ
from the Sony app in order to make it a
little bit more sparkling but it's
impossible
also this extra bass it makes mean there
is hardly any difference yeah
both are rather disappointing for
filling a large area with music so I
think everyone who wants to make some
party with more people should consider
something else maybe even the sound box
too which is yeah I mean if I have to
carry two of these I can also carry a
sound box now the son box 2 is available
with some backpack so you can carry it
like some rucksack pretty nice and I'm
not sure if it makes sense to compare
the larger XP 90 against the sound box
to the Sony's cheaper but already this
sounds so bad I cannot imagine the
bigger one sounding even better or I
don't know so I hope this was helpful to
give you an idea about the loudness
difference also the sound quality yeah
both rather average the JBL really
doesn't sound that great especially at
higher levels
so thanks for watching and see you in
the next video have a nice Thailand
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
