thanks to Iowa also to Joe born for
sending me them currently there are only
available us so they sent them to me for
a test also thanks a lot to Joe we had
some chat yesterday yeah I'm not that
impressed I mean they are great but here
I have the view play h4 and I definitely
like this more the band Olufsen with its
stock tuning it sounds a little bit of
but you have this banged up snap that
you already know from the speakers where
you can tune the song so it has to
reconnect to the phone so we have this
dot in the center that's the stock
tuning but I prefer it's very bass heavy
also with mid scoop dot but when I slide
it slightly towards relaxed it becomes
nice and still fun sounding but not as
exaggerated it sounds quite artificial
with its stock tuning and if I prefer it
to be even more neutral i slided simply
towards the left bottom corner and it
still not a monitor but then it's it's
quite a natural sound while with the
iowa yet the first thing i noticed there
is some hiss as soon as you are
connected through bluetooth there is
some slight definitely durable so i'm
sure many will complain about his the
other thing I have some bass problem
with this again some slide out of phase
space maybe to the right I hear more
bass or deeper based on to the left I'm
not quite sure I don't I don't hate this
with the h4 and a little bit too much
upper base so I get some tunnel effect
with the rock one as if it was playing
in a tunnel in some kind of large pipe
whatever H for the broader soundstage
both are closed headphones still the H
for us somehow manages and more open
sound more relaxed somehow nicer this is
a little bit boxy to me so it's maybe my
personal taste so far they both are not
neutral so compared to a Sennheiser HD
600
really different of but I prefer the
more sculpted approach from Bengal dolls
it's more tasteful for me for my own use
everyone is differently but so far yeah
I'm a little bit reserved I know Joe
told me there is lots of potential
didn't the product is a little bit rough
maybe there is definitely more potential
for further cooling I tried it through
wire and it definitely sounds better
football over Bluetooth but still and
not that satisfied sometimes I get some
hollowness which I don't quite like also
travel is not as we find and missing
some upper travel maybe not quite sure
but directly compared
I definitely take the h4 here
the nice thing is that you can tune the
sample action so if you don't like it
that bass-heavy more neutral simply
slide the box rather here to relaxed
too much hopper base but yeah this is
only a first impression it needs maybe
some burning and then I will try to do a
more detailed preview if you also some
measurements so they stay tuned for a
review yet this is just the ears from
mini DSP or real measure us those
professional guys are laughing about it
but I think for comparative measurements
it should be quite okay especially for
over ear headphones the results for in
ears differ quite a lot to a normalized
grass system but still stay tuned for a
more detailed review this is really just
the first impression and I'm not that
excited and not that the first
impression put me a little bit down to
tell the truth great build quality yeah
it has voice prompts away when you turn
it on it says power on the pendulum only
has some beeps and very very soft but
the sound doesn't excite me that much
currently especially it's not neutral
like the sennheiser this sounds
definitely wayne completely different in
this they are both very very sculpted
very very but the approach from bangles
and definitely suits more to my taste so
yeah sorry for this very short video but
i got many comments that testing I gotta
stay high rock one so I'm testing it
right now and the first impression is
not the head overwhelming it's still
great but a little bit too much upper
base which makes the sound hollow to me
especially if you compare back and forth
you will immediately get a favorite
which in my case is the h4 I like it
more than many others if i want the fan
sound if I don't want some monitoring
system but simply great
resolving great bass with the stock with
its stock tuning it it can take your
ears when you have some basic recordings
so deeper frequencies around 30 40 Hertz
you have the can tickler use and this
vibrates a lot quite fun therefore I
don't like the stock to your nails over
exaggerated but you can at least adjust
the sound to your liking
so yeah I hope you liked this little
introduction stay tuned for a full
review until then have a nice time it
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
