intern
thank goodness spring is coming back but
during the last days I was using the
Sony Ericsson Xperia quite a lot and to
tell the truth I like it more and more
it sounds really decent at lower that
normal levels if you adjust the sound
and the great thing is the settings
remain safe within speakers so we adjust
them once and it will always sound like
that but I'm also quite impressed how
loud it can play while still packing
some serious punch we already heard it
against the GB and trashley autos in my
snow video of course it was pretty windy
so I photo repeat this also with some
other containers like that I will go
here or the river turbo X which is a
pretty loud speaker but also the docking
defined which cause smaller the same as
the Sony here in Europe that is of
course twice the size and weight and
today I thought I will play only tracks
from nocopyrightsounds these are so
extreme masters really heavily let a
speaker cannot fake any additional
loudness with normal tracks a speaker
tries to compress and boost volume but
with these tracks it's quite impossible
and therefore we really hear which one
is louder
which one is loudest and so on it's
always I will be of course wearing
binaural microphones also a head came to
give you a first-person impression
please listen headphones and let's check
them out let's start with the G BHRT
this one is playing with extra bass and
I also increase based on magazine while
living meats and travel info as I think
it sounds best like this for holidays
both are playing a trance report and I
will start playing with the JBL charge 3
you can already you know more punch and
more bass from there
Donnie and I will increase volume to
maximum this is negative organ for the
Foley the charge screen also maximum it
doesn't really become that much louder
anymore
no power percent plain but also way
louder
we're just way it becomes pretty lot
from this distance
Norfolk
and spending around 20 meters away now
let's see if I can get even far away I
will reduce volume slightly Forrest oh
nice imagine that dress
now let's try then I will go the arrow
go is playing with the troll mode which
boosts volume quite a bit starting with
the arrow go volume again at around 2/3
or 3/4 the club is more tales and
possibly rather funny although we reduce
treble increasing volume for maximum
varicocele you can hear how it relatable
the limit is trying to compress the
sound the sonic wave polar also louder
with mono get volume counting
yes
what louder and then it became softer
obviously the robot doesn't really help
you another fun let's check them also
objective logo is pretty large but
somehow with also this volume panting so
way more bassy from the corner
again it started louder and then it
became softer I will use volume again
too much little better the part Sony
still sounds fuller now let's try there
we watch her work the Reba is playing
with turbo mode enabled and again volume
below maximum for both starting with the
Riveter bikes
Oh
they're quite comparable best Elizabeth
Pyrrha let's increase volume again
finesse c'mon
the reversal from sooner but also quite
a bit closer so long 10 feet away the
river does not distort swinging pretty
control not a river has type driver so
it should become louder from the side
yep that's a Tony fills it up quite well
here we'll be interested for a to driver
design while the river has three main
drivers for 50 creditors because no
distortion chemically
and now last part of this let's try the
talking be fine
of course the Sony won't have any chance
against the docking but as both cost
knowledge the same I thought it might be
still interesting to hear the difference
starting with the docking defined and
volume again around 3/4 the docking has
way more day much more punchy found
somehow both let's increase volume for
maximum opens not much louder but simply
much more control with much more days
you can hear the tone it really is love
but no chance against the docking the
AeroGarden base and support increased on
sunup
they're talking didn't appear to be
tougher here of all undistorted and much
cooler
let's saddle again folks
if Lucas which is pretty bad from the
docking the time you can hear it spreads
out much better to the tribe they're
only as a much more focused sound for
what what the from the rustic hell out
with Tony today you can hear loudness
wise really not that much difference
between these two I'm still quite
impressed
although the sony didn't manage to play
hundred percent clear at maximum but
keep in mind nocopyrightsounds tracks
are really heavily compressed mastering
is extreme so a speaker plays edit links
with this kind of noisy music still the
sony played louder than the arrow goal
which had the strange volume pumping
also know based at high levels it was
way louder than the JBL charge free
which simply got lost a little bit it
was even louder than the realtor Lex
although this plate way clean or no
distortion but also added bit more
muffled and it's quite impressive that
the docking design was not only that
much louder but of course with a fuller
sound with more days and much more
control so I'm really impressed
maybe the Sony answer sxb 30 is one of
the loudest in its category while still
really keeping some bass at maximum and
at high levels it's maybe not as loud as
you make a boom but simply with much
more bass much fuller sound also yeah
there is some distortion but you will
get this from the mega room as well of
course it's not an only direction of the
pika so the sound is quite focused you
really get the most loudness when you
are in there the sweet spot but still a
really great speaker and also suitable
for making some noise outdoors of course
I will do some further tests of the Sony
also I thought about the sound analysis
with frequency response measurements for
those who are not interested in
frequency response measurements this
videos may become a bit boring
but yeah I hope you like this it's
really a loud speaker I'm quite
impressed as I pull it against some
others and the sony was somehow louder
than most of these I don't have any
label attendant now but this is still
way better I will try to include it
within my database zone also the bigger
XP forum but I like the expectation more
for normal listening this gives you a
more high sound the XP for it sounds a
little bit off for me so yeah I hope you
like this and please could give you an
idea about the loudness of the XP 30
definitely louder than then all these
except maybe the docking which also
played quite a bit fuller with small
bass and more dynamic sound so thanks a
lot for watching and see you in the next
video have a nice time and bye bye
that's why she had to get blip nothing
thank you down let's get this crap look
