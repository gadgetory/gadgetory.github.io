video to finally conclude the topic in
yes I would like to present you the best
rounded that I found during my search to
find the best one which took me several
months with many faiths with some really
decent ones so I would like to thank
some of you especially John yang or so
Yuri for showing me in years that I
hadn't known before which sounds really
great especially compared to all this
hype junk but I think there can be only
one absolute winner I have my etymology
aforex are which is the best for me but
it's not as versatile as a more
traditional in earbud and today I would
like to concentrate on the jaybird
freedom which I would get called the
best it has all features that most of us
are longing for which is wireless great
sound it's sweat proof maybe remember I
already covered the j-bird x3 a little
bit more in detail so if you haven't
watched my video of the x-ray please
watch this first as I think the J but
freedom is small is the same simply
better it's smaller so the biggest point
of the x-ray that it didn't or doesn't
fit that well in inside the ear it
sticks out while this one disappears
completely
you could even sleep with it also the
wire is nice it's not flat not as stiff
as from the x3 so we can wear it behind
your neck more easily or so around you
but you will still need these these I
don't know how they call this some some
clips to tighten it I wear it rather
like this if I want to throw the remote
is on the right side if I want to wear
it above my head so now my chain already
all straightens the wire and like this
you can see I could even run with it
it's not meant to be used like this but
I prefer it be because I can use it like
this or normally hanging down the remote
is a little bit heavier than from the x3
and maybe the biggest drawback compared
to the x3 is worst battery life the x3
is claimed to offer eight hours this one
only four but it comes also with an
additional battery like this so the
cradle the charging cradle also acts as
some
back up so with the cradle together with
the in you will get around eight hours
so the same value as the x3 I would also
say that the freedom sounds slightly
better than the extreme a little bit
smoother with with treble maybe remember
I had some strange dips in the mid
region we'll check some frequency
response measurements later on so I
think oral the freedom for being cheaper
smaller simply nicer is that better all
rounder than the x3 and will some
additional tuning and some other tips
then the origin wants the originals just
suck it can be brought to really
reference level much better than all
those hyped try fi in years I prefer it
over any other traditional linear let it
be the Sony image one the the AKG is
samsung whatever the moon drop can
explore the nature sound ns5 I prefer
this overall all the other ones because
I can also find you on the sound to my
liking and the presets are saved within
within the in here so I said it once and
then I never touched the EQ again of
course I touch it every day because I
try to find it fine tuning a little bit
better but I mean you don't need any
additional apps just set it once and it
is fine the stock tuning is quite bass
heavy also too much somehow too much
lower treble so it doesn't sound that
great but with the EQ and other tips
it's really I mean it sounds like an
automatic of course we know this this
immersive sound without this this magic
and but it can be brought pretty close
you can make it sound bass shy you can
make it sound boo me how you like but
you can also make it really close to
some reference sound so the x3 offering
better battery life but I think I
definitely prefer the freedom not the
new version don't take the freedom to
which has a different sound more bass or
so it doesn't have AAC bluetooth
encoding so it falls back to a SBC and
you could maybe hear some some
compression artifact is already not dead
silent so if you listen to very soft
music with softer parts you might hear
some noise some his very very faint not
too strong and when the song fades out
when it's very soft you could maybe here
some some modulated hiss and it's not
severe it's not something that would
bother me but keep this in mind I mean
it's a wireless in here so there is some
compression going on but it's not as
strong as I would notice it or as it
would be somehow annoying
so the jaybird freedom is really I mean
I'm blown away I don't touch the other
ones anymore if I want to listen to
music I either take the automatic than I
hands around with with deep hips and
with wires but here I like shown a that
remote is on the right side I'm used
from the x3 because if you want it to
wear it above your ears or around their
ears the the drivers were angled so you
have to swept sites you don't need this
the remote is always are always on the
right side so I take it below my chin so
the cable is already under tension I put
it inside and it's nice no microphone
it's nothing
the only annoying thing if you turn it
on you get again these stupid voice
prompts very loud they are played at
close to maximum volume which is strange
and in inside the packaging it's a
little bit reduced although in the
manual or instant are some instruction
videos it's shown with different tips
also comply tips minding whoops man
didn't come with complete tips so forget
the original included ones where are
they they create some resonance at 7
kilo Hertz so you need some for me tips
for the best results here I'm using the
ones from the teen audio t2 and unlike
with the x3 where I had to cut the back
pad or use some slim ones it works
perfectly with standard for me tips so
this is from the Guinot do also I try to
put it as far as possible to the back
therefore so that the muzzle is not too
covered not too deep inside and then it
sounds simply perfect yeah
with additional equalizing so I tried
several presets I tried those from Yuri
who made an extensive review of the x3 I
will link it in my video he didn't
review the the freedom but they're
modest model is the same the freedom is
simply nicer because it's smaller and
has slightly less grainy treble but you
can make the one sound the same like the
other one with with the with the ape so
what I like I already showed it with the
x-ray is this parametric equalizer which
is really extensive so you can really
make it either Bumi or bass shy increase
treble decrease this hump at 3 kilohertz
that it has and you can share your
setting online I saved mine if you look
for clavinet chunky well simply clavinet
you should find mine
look at this maybe use for as a base for
your own adjustments the one from Yuri
is done with with some comply sports
tips that probably fit the treble more
so his is a little bit more treble heavy
but with the thin audio t2 tips
mmm it sounds perfect like this don't
use the original tips the original
silicon tips they just crept way too
small opening create the strange
resonance so maybe let's check out some
frequency response measurements here the
freedom f5 with the foamy tips and its
stock tuning and you can see quite
bass-heavy also this hump at 2.7 peanuts
is a bit too high so I will show you the
sound after my eq adjustment it looks
like this i reduced base i reduce this
error at 2.7 kilohertz and also reduce
this peak at 10 kilohertz which usually
makes the sound appear slightly grainy
for comparison i would like to show you
the response of the x3 also with my eq
adjustment and it looks like this it
gets the strange deep here at 2
kilohertz I'm not sure why but apart
from that it small is the same the x3
has slightly less response here at 7 8
kilohertz but thanks to the EQ it could
be also brought to the same level if
needed just for reference I will overlay
the Sony image 1 here and you can see
way more bass also
more response at four or five six
kilohertz but the overall response is
quite similar and now I would like to
demonstrate you how it sounds I recorded
it with its stock tuning so without any
cue and with my EQ setting so you will
hear the difference what changed in
detail and later on will also compare it
to the x3 also with my own EQ adjustment
but keep in mind these fine nuances this
is just a recording so in reality it I
definitely prefer the freedom over the
x3 from the recording it might appear
the contrary I'm not sure but first the
freedom with the original tuning with my
EQ adjustment and at the end you hear
the audio track for reference so that
you know how to
I hope you could hear it really needs
some additional eq adjustment because
otherwise it's too boo me and poke
undefined with treble but I think with
my setting it sounds really nice on a
really high level close to being
reference maybe so now let's compare it
against the x3 with both tuned to my
personal taste I think I brought them
quite close although there are some
slight differences and later on I will
give you on my resume so let's check it
out
is it just a dream my loving inside my
fantasy come to me you are in my
thoughts I never straight from the heart
of you
we get the
am i touching you I wanna feel
I must confess I'm really impressed I
was all impressed by the x3 but I think
the freedom is even nicer simply because
it's smaller easier to wear with nicer
wire battery life is slightly worse but
you get this external battery which also
acts as some cradle so the x3 is
definitely the year that most of us were
looking for it just needs some
additional work some equalizing and
other tips but then you get a sound
which is close to perfect if you like
more bass adjusted slightly if you like
it more treble heavy adjusted I think my
EQ setting at least for my taste
sounds very close to an automatic er4
examine all the others more expensive
ones moon drop tennis pro the NS 5 I
really I prefer this over all the others
and it's wireless so everyone looking
for great wireless but not true Wireless
but I mean you cannot have it all there
are other units from jaybird the Tara or
there are some through Wireless one spot
but they are somehow stripped down they
don't have a AC bluetooth codec so you
might hear some compression artifacts if
you are sensitive so I think the freedom
and the x3 I might maybe try the x4
instead because it's completely
waterproof I will probably return the x3
because it also has this strange sound
here with this deep at 2 kilos which I
couldn't hear that much but it always
showed up in the measurement the freedom
doesn't have this the x4 on the other
hand might have better treble and it's
completely waterproof so I could use it
during showering or whatever and not
during swimming but yeah but I really
really like the freedom and just wanted
to share this with you for all those who
have not heard about it
or have not read it try my EQ setting
just search for clavinet junkie
I met maybe publish some other ones with
more
bass less bass but you can do it by
yourself you already told me that he
didn't find my EQ setting which is
strange not true if there are shared
worldwide
I saw his settings so I'm not quite sure
why it doesn't show up on his side yeah
I think I covered all freedom from
j-bert definitely my favorite in here
over the last months that I have
searched for the perfect one so it
doesn't have any weird peaks okay if you
use the ocean tips yes but the original
response is rather pig free and I mean
it's wireless battery life four hours
could be a big question but also the
welcome tones are way too loud they have
hit be played at maximum volume but I
mean for $70 they're asleep you won't
find anything better not only sound wise
but also Wireless so blows away anything
else I found
and therefore I wanted to make this last
video in your video simply because I
think this really deserves it yeah it's
really over now no Innis anymore because
I mean doesn't make sense why this has
it all why even look any further
why look any further I have the
automatic which I use for really
critical listening I have this one I
sometimes still use the Odyssey because
they still create something different
regarding soundstage openness to the
sound although response wise they have
no chance against this went well so
thanks Yuri mm yeah you can find his x3
review is also quite extensive review in
my video description look for my EQ
press preset if you have one and keep in
mind to use some formatives really
standard but roof original comply
I have no original complaint tips but
with this from the teen audience sounds
really great so no hassle
cutting like a head here or with using
the narrow ones from the triple driver
in here with with these it sounds really
really great so this was it
no in ears anymore and I think I come at
the most important ones I'm not
interested in any other ones because
they won't be close to this also Yuri
said he prefers this over any other and
yeah strange and the same opinion if not
the automatic this would be my absolute
best and my recommendation
so yeah thanks that you join me during
the search during the odyssey to find
the best india here it is and yeah have
a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
