soundcheck of the calf mule the calf Moo
is a brand-new product and a kind of
well premium bluetooth speaker it costs
$350 but actually it's only mono it has
two drivers two unique you drivers so
they have both Twitter's inside but only
the right driver is actually playing the
whole frequency response if we have a
look at the frequency response
measurement you will see that it
measures rather balanced but there is
some inconsistency with treble and the
bass doesn't reach quite as deep for
example the Denon via minutes is half as
small and also cross less than half
measures pretty much the same and at low
levels due to the bass boost according
to human loudness controls the Denon via
will sound even more full-bodied um calf
is a British company I also have the
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins t7 here also British
and both cost exactly the same and I
thought we should check out how this
compare as always I'm using binaural
microphones so for best results please
listen with headphones and we will do
some switching with different genres and
so on and I think if someone buys such
premium speaker he probably won't play
techno but rather more acoustic stuff so
we will start with some Jayceon I'm
starting with the Kevin or first
actually you hear that only here so it's
a mono speaker
you can hear that the cave newer ramps
up the volume so it needs a little bit
of time to reach the final volume I'm
not a big fan of the t7 but actually it
fares pretty well compared against the
cave let's try another track maybe also
more acoustic smooth jazz song but still
only mono sound
I mean there g7 despite having two
drivers doesn't really give you any
stereo separation either
but we can hear that the p7 is somehow
missing treble
this isn't something else again another
trick the treble is somehow missing here
very directional speaker
I thought it might be interesting to
hear how the calf Muir compares against
for example the new revised the Reba s
cost 249 so it's hundred bucks yeah less
expensive and I think it sounds pretty
decent let's have a listen again to the
same track and I'll start with the Kevyn
Orr
well you actually get the kind of
soundstage something that is totally
missing from the from the newer
I think you can also hear that upper
treble is somehow missing from the cap
compared to their device also bass is
much deeper here
that isn't another chess track yeah you
actually have the impression of being
inside a room with the musicians with
the revised while the cave no because of
being mono yeah sounds a bit like a
kitchen video opening the frequency
response is not bad but there is simply
no stage nothing
let's try something more we have blue
sea rock
still much more convincing
Arriva s yeah sounds like high-five yet
to show and prove that the cave mu is a
mono speaker you definitely know the
track from Pink Floyd called money well
there is lots of stereo separation with
the with the coins effects at the
beginning so let's have a listen to this
I'm starting with the cave muir first
and then we will hear the river as if
there is some stereo separation it's all
coming from here now the river is
definitely left right here
let's listen to another track maybe
well more electronic to see how both
perform with this kind of music again
Kevin off first
still you have this ramp up of the track
start a bit annoying deeper bass nice a
treble somehow more punchy and of course
browser sound
I don't know this sounds much more
mature much more serious despite being a
small speaker costing $100 less than the
caffeine you
well I also have the demo in Bioman here
and I thought we should check out this
one as it looks a bit like a smaller
brother of the calf mule it's less than
half the price and also a size wise you
see it's much smaller so let's have a
listen how these two compare get from
you again first again some acoustic jazz
also much more spacious sound
let's listen to another track and nice a
travel definition
let's listen to this effect from south
persona
I will reduce volume slightly so that
you can hear how they perform at low
levels for the background listening and
so on I will try to match volumes of
both yeah the cap becomes a bit tinny
sounding well nothing to write home
about
while the den environment still sounds
quite a bit full-bodied and they're more
serious simply like a larger speaker
despite being smaller and much cheaper
again down on I hope this is healable
what I'm trying to show you okay I have
to go um I think it was clear that calf
mule is a nice speaker but well for $350
it's a bit annoying I think I mean it's
model sound you're getting here and the
quality is well nothing nothing special
so thanks for watching I hope this
helped you I hope if you liked it and we
will see us in the next video bye bye
