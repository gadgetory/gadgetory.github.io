presented it before but today I wanted
to make a more detailed video about the
EF a new Bond
the new upcoming speaker from Iran which
would be released at the end of June
with the price of around $60 you can see
the packaging it's also called SP 200
comes only with a USBC wider so charging
is done by USBC it's completely
waterproof as an omnidirectional design
similar design to the tribute eggs bomb
which is not surprising is exactly the
same engineers were responsible for both
so the engineers that worked
a tribute are working for earphone now
so this is Wallace both they're
designing maybe some of you remember I
helped to tune the tribute eggs from a
little bit but I was not involved in the
new boom here so they managed by
themselves and they managed to improve
yeah on all aspects it sounds better
more natural its louder doesn't pump as
much at higher levels so bases better
under control also at low levels it has
even more bass maybe in a bit too much
but I think it's a really nice sounding
speaker with regarding this price and
also the only direction design it can be
paired with another one for stereo
unlike the X boom which only plays in
party mode so with - for around hundred
ten hundred twenty dollars you get a
nice stereo system and will of course
compare it maybe as a duo against the
JBL charge for is still many people
think they have to spend hundred fifty
dollars for a speaker like this if you
can get better results for less here I
have the anchor sound car what's the
name flare and see it's quite similar so
we'll also compare this also
omnidirectional and I have the Bose
Soundlink revolve not plus I also have
the plus but this is the normal one you
can see it's a little bit smaller but
also way more expensive around $200
apparently a new cheaper but the
original price was 202 make this as a
kind of live video wearing my DJI Osmo
actually as head cam also my banal
microphones you should of course listen
with headphones but before I release I
would like to show you some frequency
response measurements but keep in mind
that only Russian speakers are not that
easy to measure so here a measurement
parity with the driver with indoor and
outdoor mode auto mode produces base
which would rather do exactly the
opposite as far out
would usually need more base but this
autumn up will come in handy at high
levels as we will see later on therefore
let's have a look at some further volume
levels at low levels there is no
additional base boost but it's already
quite bass heavy with this in the mode
that it doesn't really need it you can
see it idles it reduces bass and at
maximum again here with indoor and
without door so you can see with the in
Vermont most of the braces lost while
outer manages to keep a bit more upper
base let's have a look at the
measurement from the side compared to
the one from front and you can see you
lose some treble but if we average both
you get some kind of power response of
this pickup from all around and you can
see it's not necessarily high five but I
would say the overall sound is quite
natural with some stronger bass boost
especially when set to indoor mode but
overall I think it does a really great
job so now let's have a listen
put up your headphones and let's check
it out let's stop comparing the you boom
against its brother the tribute X boom I
will turn it on so you can hear the
welcome tones nothing fancy pretty
simple and let's start with rec from
salvation princess freesia post because
are playing with their base modes
the credit can hear it has a hepa
clarity and more natural frequency
response without this base the boosts
meet slightly becomes louder but also
uses bass so I think like this it's not
definitely try some
let's try this track especially treble
which is not easy to tune for an
American speaker I think they've done it
quite well here
even here although I tried he had to
make it this entire somehow Dean managed
this sounds nice how it maids nice of a
treble and also basis slightly better
this sounds a bit more distant a bit
more wheeled maybe
that's why this if you listen close you
will notice that the bass drum is always
slightly distorted here so I will
increase volume a bit more all starts
reducing bass at higher levels but I
think it's still quite okay give this
doesn't sound that great
the difference is not huge but the new
boom definitely manages a better result
so let's see how it compares to the boss
starting again with the EF a new boom
opposed it sounds really weird I was
quite impressed with it some years ago
but yeah you can hit the result it
sounds way more open somehow yeah no
competition here
that's why this work there is some
stereo mixed in you can definitely hear
it here but the Bose is a mono speaker
so and also sound wise not really that
great
something else the base is really nicely
under control no distortion no clumping
the bows yeah it's all just weird with
this diffuse strange sound maybe let's
put it upside down and always prepare it
like this but this this sounds nice and
stinky more normal I mean I could also
come up with one pilot oh it's me yeah
let's write something else and to also
try the drivers are somewhere near so
each movie sound better like this
but this one just to see people playing
backwards somehow I'm not sure Edson
there's still no competition that's why
this track maybe let's hear how it
renders vocals special treble has some
issues here I think we hit a difference
nowadays some rock I'm not sure how it's
better I think it small at the same here
the goals
let's increase volumes levels faster
sonic muffler
somehow more behind some not perfect but
also like this it's this was okay from
about this has a little bit of a boxy
character maybe let's try it with a
volume the power
maximum
very open
I have quite a good friends here
of this extra base or let's call it auto
mode as I think it retains a bit more
upper base like this
Oh
so also here no real competition
let's try it against the anchor the Inca
is playing with face up the ear from
again within the mold and they start
again with the EF Anu boom sound quiet
without face up here with optimal not
that much difference
at low levels we definitely get some
bass here why the anchor will still
remain pretty thin so let's increase
volume again and
here the base is somehow missing and so
Trevor
yeah that's why this and let's listen
Holly - - I will again turn on this
optimal volume and also quite a
difference I would say it last but not
least let's compared against the JBL
charge for which is quite a bit more
expensive around hundred fifty dollars
so one Irfan is sixty two would be
hundred twenty later on we'll compare
them connected in serum but now with a
single one and again starting with the
EF a new bomb
the tibia in Sanskrit we hear of it
misses tribal definition has a big
emphasis on base but cannot keep the
space up to maximum so he'll definitely
get a nicer sound more spreading to the
ohm also from all the angles like this
but base twice the gdl definitely has an
edge here
let's buy this track
the tibia you can hear lots of bass are
then somehow the frequency response
comes down
so base wise a single one can't quite
compete at low level yes but like this I
don't have it already starts to lose
base so let's connect them for stereo
also quite nice is once connected you
just have to turn on the slave and they
will pair automatically takes some
seconds and let's start again with a
both playing so it's still the same
loudness but they became quite a bit
louder like this the GBO increase volume
a bit
so now they are I would say they have
even an edge regarding the overall sound
and power let's for this part more turn
them around
they are omnidirectional
it's somehow nice Sun more high five
more animal Richard is
at JBL of course I could also pair it
with another one but we will be around
300 Alice like this so more than twice
the price of two new boom
you can hear the sounds quite a bit
better
she hated this hopeless and also here
from all angles to get a nice song
so the GDL becomes quite hopeless like
this miss my district and I will
increase volume we have to maximum let's
see how loud the key plays
um spaced out to blow away the JBL here
being cheaper and yeah
and also here's some slight indentation
or I don't know let's try this bag they
completely blow the JBL all of the water
like this name zero no change
this is horrible especially all face
this torture table extreme level engine
this right that is quite a lot
despite having a lower price it's a
completely other level I hope you could
hear it does a really great job also is
this terapia stereo pairing is flawless
you can also check it out from my
database I recorded just one like this
so you can compare it to the previous
game or some other own directions
because I think it sounds similar to the
credit but better in all regards so the
frequency response is more even more
natural basis better under control
doesn't pump as much at higher levels
and it also outperforms the way more
expensive balls sound agree wolf and not
even talking about the ankus and
commotion here and as a sterile pair I
think it competes quite nicely against
the JBL charge for so there is no reason
to spend that much money for some
speaker simply because there is JBL with
known it even did a great job with the
new boom or VT 200 so yeah for anyone
who is interested check it out $60 quite
a good price I'm not saying this because
I want to promote it somehow I was not
involved in in any way with the design
or tuning I tried to give them some
hints how to make the frequency response
maybe even slightly smoother but they
were satisfied like this so the design
is nice you get this flap here that you
can let it hang somewhere completely
waterproof I already tried it my son
tried it put it into water so it
survived with the problems and I liked
the sound up to medium levels because
it's really meaty bass heavy especially
for out those nice the title is it loses
a little bit of bass but still sounds
really controlled and never distort it
or something and - yeah sounds really
great also boost volume and make it more
comparable to larger more expensive
speakers like they're charged for so I
hope you like this video check it out
from a database compared to the mini
Rick maybe I didn't want to put in the
mineral here as it's more expensive and
it's a different kind of speaker it's a
modular system so you can add the
subwoofer and to mix with one subwoofer
more expensive but also blow away any
other speaker in this size or price
range so you can compare it to my
database against the mini Rick Minnick
mini and so on but I think you found it
every great job with this the engineers
already did a nice job with the X boom
and with my slide help tuning the
exponent they improved even more on this
year so I hope you liked this video I
hope this could give you a first
impression about the sound of the
earphone new boom or PT 200 there will
be more speakers coming from even a
smaller one
it is not hard one and not quite true so
we have to keep an eye on it at earphone
because I think they will release some
really interesting stuff in future yeah
thanks a lot for watching and see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
