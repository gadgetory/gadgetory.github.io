bit of controversy about my recent video
with a FIFA Stockholm 2.0 against the
main news oh I think that quite
comparable not only price-wise size wise
but also feature wise both I quit with
Wi-Fi with matching functions
I just wanted to concentrate on some but
still many complained yet and then can
do so much more you can stream over
Wi-Fi over Bluetooth you lose quality
and so on another one you put the people
on top you how can the name sound good
try this with the people put something
on top and listen again one criticize
that I didn't use the Sun settings which
are available through the app but it's
not much like just a setting which
allows you to boost baseball or news or
don't boost it I played it with standard
settings I didn't change much and ever
setting is the placement this allows you
to reduce base if it's closer to more
than 25 centimeters but in this case we
have far away one and a half meters so I
also set it at more than 25 centimeters
so it was playing with extender settings
there is not much you cannot change the
Sun there's no if you nothing the people
on the other end officially doesn't have
any Sun settings mmm but there is it has
everything built-in so there is an 8-bit
mode other tunings also placements
unfortunately it's a little bit hidden
I'm not allowed to talk about this but
the FIFA can definitely be tuned for
more base I think this was also one
point of criticism that the p4 doesn't
have enough space with late night
it definitely has and I would like to
repeat this test and keep it as fair as
possible I would like to stream over
here play now and sweat tears because in
between so I will record one after the
other and we'll do the switching
afterwards this way you will also
probably hear the difference is better
than with a light video and switching
life but first I would like to show you
the Sun settings of the name Musil I
will stream over a plane first rate
baby come on out kid
no I wanna see everything
you hide out from the mirror
don't you see everything you're always
about devotion is my guarantee sure you
should leave your hair Oh mister don't
put no makeup on
no need to be modest baby don't be shy
be proud of all the things you got let
me ha
but you my love I do most everything you
sweet baby I'll do most everything come
son good buddy and I hope you feel the
same way
the ocean blue
just by you myself
ain't nothin sweet daddy that I wouldn't
be for you
he gave me milk cream
so to all those Maine fanboys saying
that this is not the name that I know it
sounds much better than reality
yeah I'm sorry guys of course this is
just the recording but he put here from
the relative differences that the name
yeah it's may be nice but that was it
compared to the FIFA it has no chance
the FIFO buffer stairway modified way
more open sound base wise welcome level
especially with like that
the name user lakes this definition so
it's okay for you know mechanism
possibilities
bling-bling lights here but for serious
music listening it has no chance against
the P from the name currently 800 views
I think the FIFA on the German Amazon
store is counted for 900 for the euros
so I think what I hope for it's really
incredible completely blows the name
away and next time I will take the
compare it may be against my own audio
from I don't is because unfair they're
cheaper I can also separate them but I
want to keep them rather closer so they
are more comparable and let's see which
one will be the winner but here I mean
it's obvious it's clear that name so I'm
just Maddie and I really wanted to be as
fair as possible both wind over a player
also remove this cover to open the
sounds lately for the name but it didn't
improve that much because the general
tuning is what is likely over this
strange peaks at 7 8 kilohertz the FIFA
is completely smooth if you could
hopefully hear it from the recording so
maybe at home if your own it sounds
great but overall it doesn't it's ok
it's a nice speaker but it doesn't blow
me away and I already help from the very
beginning it's nothing special I read
and saw some videos on YouTube cleanly
it's the best and what a high head it's
not high end it's okay it can play loud
also impressive bass but it's not a
speaker they would like to listen to it
doesn't involve it doesn't put me into
the music why with the FIFA yeah I
really I want to sit in front and listen
to music again so yeah I hope this was
helpful
to conclude the topic name and not sure
if I will manage to include into my
database I'm sorry I may be short of
time I also in the mean time I sold it
so I will send it away in two three days
maybe if I manage I will try to include
both but first hopefully the name and
the FIFA afterwards yeah please the only
income I get from this stupid database
are your donation so if you find my work
habits elimination is welcome so I can
find maybe some time to include us
because it takes yeah let's say
recording everything maybe about one
hour
and anything everything so more than two
hours to include one speaker if I have
different sound modes I will have to
recall it twice so it really takes lots
of times sometimes I just record three
posts because the whole day and nothing
else and they have nothing from this you
know I do this for you please understand
I don't need this database I don't
meaning I do it only for you and if
you'll find it somehow helpful any help
from you is also welcome so thanks all
for watching and see the next video may
be against the audio properity 20 next
week maybe or whatever so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
