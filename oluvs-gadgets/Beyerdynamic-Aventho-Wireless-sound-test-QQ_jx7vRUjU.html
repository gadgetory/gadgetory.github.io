event for wireless which was sent again
to me by one of my viewers so thanks her
name this is quite an expensive Wireless
on Eire which usually cost around four
hundred four hundred fifty dollars but
currently it's discounted or lemmas on
four three or twenty four which makes it
even cheaper than the wired version
which is around 350 here in Europe it's
hard to find the wireless version below
400 euros so I think for 3 out of 24 it
might appear like some bargain although
I think it's still quite overpriced to
what you get here design as you can see
is a bit retro a little bit old-school
also feels quite shaky but I think the
build quality is nice oh it is sturdy I
don't think it will break that easily
but design is maybe not my thing
let's look at the packaging you can see
the unique feature is sound
personalization by mini like we had from
the new reform and from the audio that I
reviewed someone said oh inside is this
carrying pouch it comes with a charging
cable charging is done by USB C which is
of course nice and it also comes with a
3.5 millimeter cable it sounds small is
the same wired or Wireless I tried to
measure it it was not easy because of
this on your character and this is the
biggest problem because the sound
changes a lot depending on how you place
it on your ear there is only a very
narrow sweet spot how it sounds perfect
if you turn it around slightly it really
hard to get the sound perfect and I also
fight to get it sound equal for left and
right so I have to play some music
because simply pulling it on then start
music you will notice that it sounds
different so I realized it all the time
it doesn't have any active noise
cancellation I think it isolates quite
well so as soon as you have placed it
nicely it is ok yeah I didn't do any
measurements because it looked a little
bit weird I tried it with this over ear
compensation but it didn't hate it
didn't appear valid to me I looked at
some other measurements they also looked
weird what I didn't tell you it has some
touchpad the only button is for turning
it on
and then you can by swiping to the front
you can change the track forward swiping
through the back backward swiping down
volume down swiping up volume up and
double tapping stops or plays music yeah
what about this personalization in case
of the event phone it works I mean it
really improves the sound slightly mmm
you can customize it first by your age
so you put in your birth date and then
it's all ready readjust the sound
similar what you also get from Sona
works you can also avoid the sauna works
sound improvement based on your age is a
little bit rough so here I think it's
quite okay so I put in my birth date and
it already became clearer maybe a bit
too much but you can also adjust the
percentage so from 20 up to hundred
percent or turn it off
mm from wire it sounds the same as with
a turned off profile I think it sounds
already okay and when turning on the
profile it also becomes louder maybe to
compensate for the hearing loss for the
overall hearing loss of a 45 h1 I'm not
sure I also tried putting in some some
older ages like my father 75 years old
and it boosts rail a lot but also starts
to compress because the volume is also
posted which is a little bit strange so
for audio purists they probably won't
use this profile is Asian because it
really impacts it has some impact info
that dynamics of the sound so a 75 year
old will maybe get these high
frequencies which which usually won't
hear anymore but the sound also appears
quite a bit compressed as yeah as if
some limiter was was working the app
itself it's also quite buggy and you can
also customize it by some hearing test
for the left and right ear separately it
will play some tones with different
frequencies and you keep a button
pressed as long as you hear it and
afterwards it creates an own profile for
you yeah the only thing I noticed is
that it becomes louder with the profile
and a bit
more travel heavy apart from that it
doesn't change the sound that much like
we had from the nura phone which made
the headphone sound completely different
but not really better in this case that
overall characteristics doesn't change
that much but I will simply let you
listen and hear I will play a track from
so person princess region first without
profile then I will switch on the
profile and you will notice that it
becomes
we can't
so because of the volume increase it
would appear as if the personalized
sound would automatically sound better
which is not quite true so I will play
it again and match volumes afterwards
this way you will really hear the
difference is
I think would hear the biggest change
with the profile is that you get more
treble there is also some slight impact
on mids but in my case apart from treble
not much has changed maybe if you have
some really strange hearing or you hear
worse on the left or right side it might
compensate for this I could have created
some fake profile pretending that I
don't hear meat well I could maybe try
so I'm not sure if it really compensates
for this a pattern that you could also
hear that the overall characteristics is
quite natural so it doesn't sound off
but treble is to put bloated somehow but
like some refinement so treble doesn't
seem as we find as I would have liked
but it simply it will be boosted in a
bit harsh at the same time you get some
mid bass
some upper bass boost but it likes the
slower bass impact from many other
wireless headphones like from Bennett
Olsen which really have some kicking
bass which is already quite funny
sounding so this one has some slight
smell response of our treble is lacking
refinement I've ever met I think it
sounds nice not neutral but a fun and
tasteful tuning I would have preferred a
bit more refinement to the sound so the
travel appears to - yeah - to Wooley
somehow I listen to a lot of tracks
compared back and forth and I liked it
but I mean this is already 324 or 400
year old so I would have expected a
little bit more maybe let's compare it
to another one from biodynamic which I
currently have at home the DT 250 which
is not Wireless but I think it has quite
a nice neutral sound we can of course
also compare it to my database I
included some headphones not all of them
that I have but for fun I included also
the event for here so I can compare it
against some neutral sounding one like
the sennheiser HD 58 X Jubilee which is
also way cheaper
but for Wireless I think maybe the price
is justified I have not got sure so
let's compare it to this DP 250 I'm sure
many will probably like the event for
more I will play it with this custom
profile which boosts reloj slightly
and of course the DP 250 is playing
without any queue and afterwards you can
tell me would you like more
I think overall it's quite a nice head
home although still a bit overpriced
it's nicely small also this rotatable
ear pads make it appear little bit
smaller I have some problems with this
on your design but away from that it's
really nice not the best sounding one
but it sounds ok mmm I could imagine
listening with this on the go although I
think I prefer some really decent
selling in is mmm it isolates a little
not much but it's ok
the sound is ok with this personal
profile I could maybe try to really
create some fake one to see what it will
do if I don't if I pretend to not hear
in meats or bass or whatever in my case
you could hear the change in sound was
not that much just a little bit more
treble boost or some based on my age I
tried creating a profile without
inserting a birth birth date but this
resulted in a strange sound also way too
compressed somehow already distorted so
you have to get sure to insert some
birth date and then create your custom
profile already by this birth date alone
it already tries to compensate for your
natural hearing loss then it tells you
how much percentage you have although
I'm not sure if it's if this percentage
of your hearing is based on your birth
date or on an absolute value
I had 92 for the left and 91 for the
right one or something so maybe for my
age yeah I'm still at 90 percent or 90
percent over I'm not quite sure yeah
nothing is to say thanks for never
lending me this it's a nice sounding a
little bit yeah it could be still more
tasteful I mean I think by a dynamic
does great tuning but the treble appears
too too thick overall for me so it's not
I don't hear the details
I rather here somewhere
some I don't know some harshness but
it's way better than the dt 880 which
was just treble this at least
compensates with some bass although I
would have also rather boost at lower
base not this there is some boost it
seems around hundred hundred fifty Hertz
makes it a little bit boo me there also
a bit shaky badly it looks and it looks
okay so if you like this design also
available in completely black but I
think this is some fault leather it's
not real but it looks very very soft so
very very smooth still I mean for 324 ok
but not for 550 or 400 years this is
really steep high dynamic should they
should become make some more reasonable
prices maybe because it's because of
this profile sound customization I'm not
quite sure the app is a little buggy
sometimes you press something nothing
happens and then after some seconds it
switches to the next menu so yeah the
idea of samples personalization
is great but it should really work
perfectly I mean I'm not quite sure how
great this is it just seems to me like
some treble boost but I will try maybe
to just for fun to pretend not hearing
meets I'm really wondering what happens
yeah I hope this was helpful a bit and
yeah see you in the next video until
then have a nice time and bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
