hi and welcome with this quick and
improvised video I just wanted to say
thanks to all of my subscribers for your
continuous support and I wanted to make
a quick resume about this year what
we've heard what was great I've
collected maybe some of the bests
because I've found here and I thought we
will start with the smallest and fight
us until the biggest so let's start with
the so an audio transit access this is
not a cheap speaker but it's really
pocketable and has great sound it sounds
really full-bodied and mature compared
to most other similar sized speakers
I've already seen it for about $70 so if
you can find it for this price it's
definitely worth it it's not a loud
speaker but it sounds simply great then
we've also heard the JBL flip 3 which i
think is a really solid performer you
can buy two of them and join them for
stereo it's not very bass heavy in fact
it has a more natural sound but it's
loud the battery life is great and it's
simply a nice speaker recently I got the
mini Eric in reality I got the whole 2.1
set and i think this is really an
impressive speaker there's not a cheap
speaker but it sounds very mature at low
levels and can play also very loud
louder than the UE boom if you need more
bass you simply add this up you can join
to four wireless stereo it's really an
impressive speaker from a very small
British company I think two guys are
making these speakers they are made in
Britain so this is not some China stuff
but really handmade and engineered in in
Britain then of course we have the River
s here one of the well most awaited
speakers maybe a little I really like it
a lot it blows the
comparable both something mini away
asleep as we've heard in some of my
videos already currently I don't have
the larger turbo X because mine had a
problem I'm waiting for a new device so
we will be able to compare the small one
to the bigger brother then I also got
this very interesting speaker from
Denmark sorry it is not Dutch but then
if I made a mistake in my recent video
so this is a Danish speaker called FIFA
Helsinki this is so impressive because
it can play really loud with lots of
bass deep bass not boosted bass a very
very even high fight you don't sound but
still very punchy not cheap either so
all these because definitely a bit
higher level we have another
Scandinavian speaker this is the audio
pro add-on t3 this goes for a thing 150
British pounds or about 200 250 euros
I'm not sure about availability in the
US but also a very nice high five human
speaker
I really like the fugu XL a lot
I mean it's designed as an outdoor
speaker but I think it sounds really
great indoors that bass is really deep
and punchy I have I have hardly heard
any such a punchy bass from a speaker
that sized although I have to confess
that I prefer it without any jacket it's
not meant to be used like this but it
sounds simply cleaner yeah and and
clearer like this it struggles a bit at
higher levels so it's it cannot quite
compete with for example the JBL extreme
which is really tuned for loudness and
bass but I prefer the more even and more
HiFi sound of the fugu XL let's let it
here without without the cover I already
mentioned the JBL extreme it's still a
very nice speaker and
highly recommended for everyone who
wants to make a party out of party with
friends buy another one or ask your
friend who has one and you can join both
for a stereo to increase loudness but
also create an impressive soundstage
really a nice speaker although I don't
quite like it for everyday use at home
and so on it's simply tuned to bass
heavy it doesn't sound very what I was
what I would call a natural but rather
really more for fun party and so I
rather prefer the FIFA or the full XL
and recently I also got in in reality I
got in yesterday the library tongs if
mini and the fly baton zip these are
really two very interesting speakers
because this is the first speaker that
is also bluetooth but also multi room so
similar to what Sano's does but you can
also use it as a say it's a normal
portable bluetooth speaker the same goes
for this in reality the functionality is
the same this is just a smaller version
I had their fault listen to them they
are pretty solid performers but I prefer
the smaller one the smaller one sounds
clearer it doesn't have this big bass of
the big version but it sounds simply
more better tuned I mean the treble is
there here the treble has some strange
sibilance I don't know how you call it
in English it sounds simply not right so
let's put it away let's keep that one of
course I will do some comparisons but
not this year anymore but coming up next
will be of course the lab returns it
meaning maybe even compared against a
FIFA of course it cannot quite compete
at high levels but from what I've heard
at low levels they are quite comparable
here maybe also against their food way
excel yeah and then here we have the
really big boys the serious ones the IVA
XS 9 and the powerful booms - XL
they are both quite comparable but the
boomstick costs twice as
we Europeans have to pay twice the price
for similar performance that you get in
America both are really great because
highly recommended the IRA is only
available in the US while the toy for
boom star is only available in Europe so
then you either have to go for the IVA
if you're European you have to go for
the Toy Fair both are great but from
what I heard IVA is going to release
this because in Europe maybe in spring
next year so yeah this was it the
upcoming comparisons yeah I also wanted
to thank everyone who is using the
affiliate links I sometimes I'm
sometimes pull a posting because I could
collect a little bit of gift cards on
Amazon because of this Amazon sorry and
I will be ordering the grain audio PBS
0.01 I don't know it's a similar maybe
to the reverse but it's wooden a little
bit larger and heads low had lots of
praise but also some critics so I was
not sure what to expect from speaker and
when it was announced I was really
curious to hear it once and now I have
the chance thanks to you because of the
affiliate links you are clicking and
buying products this will allow me to of
course buy speakers from America that
are simply not available in New York of
course there are some others because
interesting ones I've haven't heard
because they are not not released now
like the beats pill plus it's already
here in Europe but I didn't have the
chance to hear it there will be also
coming up the clips groove also very
handy small speaker it could be pretty
interesting from what I heard really a
nice perform a model like the MINIX but
you can connect to mini Rick's
wirelessly you cannot do this with the
clip so it remains a simply simply mono
speaker but it should pick some punch
and be really loud yeah and I don't know
I think this was it
let me see no I think that was it if
there is another interesting product you
want to suggest yet please do I have
lots of cheap
or let's say low budgets because I would
like to present next time also next year
and of course I would like to do some
giveaways as I have simply so many now
that I cannot keep them all and if you
have any idea how I could raffle these
giveaways I mean between among all those
subscribers I don't know how to select
one I mean I cannot just yeah I like
this name I want to make it a more
random randomized if you have an idea
how to manage
yeah please let me know as I would like
to give away some of these speakers and
next year I hope to finally manage to
finish my speaker audio database some
already know it and yeah please keep it
still secretly as its it's not finished
yet but those who know it keep
continuing use it I will be adding the
FIFA Helsinki next the mini Eric will be
coming next
I've already did some recordings the lab
returns if is still going to be recorded
all the other rest you can see here is
already included in this database no
this not yet but I will include this
also very soon so this will be the next
big project for next deal finishing my
audio database where you can compare all
speakers among among every speaker with
another one just like you want yeah you
can compare the either XS 9 against the
transit access of course with the same
songs with the same controlled recording
I think this will be pretty interesting
and I know those who already are using
it like it quite a lot I also use it
sometimes just to listen to speakers
that I don't own anymore like for
example the do play a tool and if I want
to compare it to the FIFA I listen to
them from the database as the recording
is really true I listened with bang &amp;amp;
olufsen do play h6 headphones and I
tried lots of headphones but this key
gave me the best results and this is as
close to reality as I can get if I
listen with these headphones I have the
impression as if I was sitting in front
of the speaker I tried to other ones
from
Sennheiser from biodynamic dynamic and a
AKG Akagi Altadena FEMA but the best
results I'm getting with the bill play
h6 no no idea why but these headphones
really work well with my microphones so
again thanks a lot it's also I wanted to
apologize for my recent videos which
became a bit longer at the moment some
longer than 20 minutes but I simply
wanted to show you as many different
styles and hours to make the speakers
more comparable I noticed that SPR can
sound can sound great with one song but
then you put in another it sounds worse
than than the other speaker so it's not
easy I always try to select songs which
yeah which reveal problems because they
are mastered very fat and you get
distortion when you crank the speakers
up or something so usually I don't play
classical music as they have a very
limited frequency band you don't get
much bass you don't get them a much
treble but simply all is playing in
there in the mid section so I prefer if
there's really lots of bass lots of
treble hi-hat and so on so you can
really hear how the performs across the
entire spectrum so I would like to wish
everyone a Merry Christmas of course a
happy new year I will need this short
break for the upcoming videos but I will
prepare them next year
I cannot dispute more
with all of our power really a lot of
different comparisons selecting
playlists finding great songs which
don't cause any copyright problems is
really I'm sitting sometimes until 3
o'clock in the morning listening which
song sounds good
which song reveals problems through a
speaker I mean I cannot take some song
wait that's good I really try to find
something suitable so there is some
energy that I put although my videos are
not that great you know fancy zooming in
zooming out and and that fulfilled and
everything I simply don't have the time
to do all this I do other stuff I do my
recordings I tried adding sorry that's
because to my database so yeah it's
becoming a full-time job but I'm still
far away of doing this for living so
it's it's only a hobby for me
again I hope you liked everything so far
if you have any kind of criticism please
tell me but no please no fanboy ISM
about any brand I'm open to any brand I
just don't like yeah overpriced junk
with bad sound quality I think you
notice that I prefer good sound so even
if ultimately is makes great products
they simply don't sound good therefore
yeah I rather omit them I mean what a
speaker performs the guy I get
goosebumps but not the speaker that I
can throw around and into my food
offices not what I'm after so again
thanks a lot for everyone to everyone I
think we have had a great year now and I
hope the next year will become even
better as it seems I have the impression
as if this because became really better
and better every year two three years
ago we had this jam box we had the beats
pill I mean this was overpriced junk and
now we have speakers like the reverse
that sound like a bigger speak I mean
we've compared it against compare it
against 33 of course it cannot compete
at higher levels but at low levels the
reverse performs even better
so it will be definitely interesting I
don't know what ideas the companies will
have I really like the concept of lab
rat on a portable speaker together with
multi-room system this is really the
first time
some company managed it in such a great
way you don't need to buy speakers for
every room like you have to do with
Sonos and in kitchen you put one Sonos
play:1 into the kitchen two sons play
five into the living room and so on and
you have two three thousand dollars
spent here you buy one speaker you carry
it from from the kitchen to the bathroom
and another one for example that you
live in to inside the living room you
can always link them take them away with
you and so on so it's really a great
concept and we will hear how they
perform compete against the competition
I will of course also do some other
videos of the mini Rick as it's so
promising I am really surprised how well
it it became I knew the old version then
on Bluetooth this one is Bluetooth and
it sounds much better than that previous
version so of course we will also hear
more about the revised hopefully I will
get a new turbo X zone so we will also
continue doing some comparisons with the
turbo X and I'm sure JBL will will
release a JBL charge 3 soon and maybe a
flip for a JBL even extremer who knows
so thanks yeah it's becoming again a bit
longer I'm sorry for that but just to
say thank you to all of you I hope you
have a nice time a nice Christmas nice
holidays and yeah I wish you all the
best bye bye
