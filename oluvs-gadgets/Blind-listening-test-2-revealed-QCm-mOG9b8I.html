video in the new year I hope you had a
nice holiday just like us and I hope you
didn't mind the fun videos I posted to
and my son but I didn't know how much
fun sleigh riding can be so I thought I
will share this with you but now back to
the speakers and the first I would like
to reveal the blind listening test we
did last time
premium class with the hammock alen√ßon
play the fee followed by foot boom star
XL and the mini rigs all about similar
price range around 300 up to 500 dollars
and there were many who really could
distinguish all four correctly others
did not that well but we'll also some
interesting claims some said that C's
best many claimed B's best some like a
most others the most but many really
claimed that D was the worst so I don't
want to hold it back any longer and just
check it out
yeah I think there were no real
surprises here and I think it has proven
that music and sound is always a matter
of taste
otherwise I cannot explain how the
toffee boom store Excel was hurt as
worst by many while others liked it most
I was personally really impressed by the
mini Rick's also surprised me a lot as
these are the smallest here also way
lightest with 1.7 kilograms while the
next one is the Fe Fausto with 2.4 the
Harman Kardon when played twice as much
than the mini wreaks and that profit
comes to excel with 10 kilograms I think
the mini reeks felt really well
especially as this is not a known brand
like JBL Harman Kardon just some guys
from Britain who do their own stuff but
two mini rigs together the sub are
really impressive also I tested them at
maximum and I got seven hours
none of these managed seven hours at
maximum the Hammond caren cowan play
will die after around two hours this
around one hour 40 maybe and the boom
store Excel has some problems with
mixing volume as the sub / sub you'll
always cuts out irregularly I don't know
sometimes it plays for one hour and then
the subwoofer subwoofer cuts out then it
plays for 15 minutes and there's a
buffer cuts out I'm not sure what's
going on here
many complained about the same problem
if you watch or read the Amazon the
German Amazon reviews of the boom
turkcell there are some reports about
about this problem so I hope you liked
this blind listening Ling test if it was
great if you liked it
I would like to repeat it with maybe
even the ultraportable class so please
tell me how you liked it
tell me your thoughts after and
afterwards now that we know which
speaker was actually playing and yes you
in the next video have a nice time bye
bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
