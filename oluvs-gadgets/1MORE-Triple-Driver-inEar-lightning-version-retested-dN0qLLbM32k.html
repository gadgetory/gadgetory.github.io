take on the one more triple driver in
the headphone game tuned by grammy
award-winning sound engineer Luca B Abdi
some of you may have already seen my
ranting button in one of my career's
videos I compared it to some cheaper
ones and it was by far the worst really
horrible sounding to me quite cheap but
then I got some controversial comments
by you accusing me that I have no idea
about sound
I should stop all this stop reviewing
headphones and in ears and my videos are
not in entertaining so I thought how can
it be that I hear them horrible while
others think they are great and I wanted
to give them another chance
I ordered a brand new unit from Amazon
the other one was an open unit from
Amazon warehouse and to cut it short
it's a completely different India they
are not comparable the other one was
just junk why this is actually quite
decent so I have to also apologize to
mr. leukopenia hardy SC me this piace
scusa me ma qualit ro li own pets or
email so this one is really nice and
unfortunately I grabbed a version with
lightning connector but I think they
should still sound the same regardless
if lightning or 3.5 millimeter yeah the
Lightning connector causes some problems
for me but I will talk about this later
first let's look at the packaging it's a
little bit different maybe because it's
a different version so you don't have
this pouch here like on the other one
the tips are inside in some own
compartment let's say the pouch is also
here so the tips are still mall is the
same lots of tips which is of course
great so how does it sound
I think overall and I'm not talking
about the previous one this was just
junk this was some fake one in the only
explanation I can have for this is that
it was some clone some China replica
someone bought the original from Amazon
swept them put in some China fake and
return it then Amazon sold it to me but
the original yeah lots of problems with
fake replicas you cannot be sure to get
a good one so there is lots of scam with
this but the original sounds really
decent so overall Sony's nicely balanced
slightly boosted bass for me maybe a
little bit too much upper base so this
colors vocals too much for me
meats are nice but the problem I have is
treble it sounds a bit metallic it's
much better than the others like this
case that that s6 or something
also them what was it the Xiaomi me
so this is really nice although yeah
treble is a bit too color to me so
compared to this another H is example
you'll notice that there is some slight
sibilance
I tried also a different tips they all
color the sound slightly and somehow I
found the case that said s6 tips to be
most appealing to me
they changed trail in such a manner that
I started to like them you can see these
tips they get their flash with this I
don't know how to call it is it a noodle
so this changes the sound compared to
this year let me try putting them on
because this extent quite a bit so yeah
the noodle I hope it's not too history
and it's far inside maybe this give some
additional resonance so with these tips
I tell it to like them and I was really
considering keeping them but still when
compared to an IRA especially for my
modded one I would probably go for the
IRA
not only because of the price this is
$50 I'm not sure about the current price
for the lightning version I paid 130
yeah I will probably return it because
also volume control is very rough so for
a comfortable listening level
let me try from yesterday doesn't want
an assistant no I am way below half if
it's already quite loud so I couldn't
even go above half and it's very rough
the volume is quite stepped while here
with an normal analog you get some you
really can find unit volume so this is
one problem and apart from that yeah I
think my model I was still sounds nicer
the treble is of course more elevated
also bass is slightly more boosted but
it's more than lower base this has more
upper base but here you gave you
it's a really nice kick so depending on
a recording most will probably like the
I lost more but without more they are
way too bright so compared to the one
more here
and the hyper without mode appears
nearly shriek or piercing therefore yeah
I have four layers of paper inside I
found some it's not maybe paper it's a
material which has the feeling of the
paper it was a one-way cover for pillows
and I cut it made four layers of it the
advantage over toilet paper is that it
doesn't tear or is it pair how is it
here or tear here is one I don't know
sorry for my pronunciation so I have
four layers and this filters travel to
such a degree that I really enjoy them
more than the one more also the
soundstage appears somehow nicer with
the Iowas the meets slightly recessed so
they have definitely not flats because
but nor neither at this so when compared
to Sennheiser HD examined that the HTC
silence sounds definitely more natural
with nicer treble the biggest problem is
really Trevor here if not the treble if
it sounded more natural not that
metallic it has some metallic character
I would probably consider keeping them
because I also try to move my recordings
with my videos and taste sound quite
natural bass is slightly too much but
overall nice I cannot watch my videos
with the highest because it's too much
bass so when I watch a video of the
audio program fire with the iOS it's
only drowning so they are not meant to
be monitors or something but neither are
these so still they are quite enjoying
and I like them about switching back and
forth I definitely like the I was small
also because of the price maybe so yeah
I hope I cleared up some confusion they
are great if in years but I wouldn't
call them the best below $100 so many
reviews raving about them they are
decent I think they could be even better
because the treble is not right so maybe
it's not look at being artists fault
maybe it's the fault of my ears everyone
has different ears and
even there are some some papers with
measurements of any measurements from
Latin from different people wearing an
SN Heiser issues external and everyone
hears it differently only two or three
individuals had the correct response why
all the others heard something
completely different therefore maybe for
my ears they are not that suitable but a
friend of mine mark from mini clang
Wanda he had the same issue that the
travel is too metallic apart from that
they are nice and if you are interested
or if you lost interest on them because
of my printing last time check them out
although yet you have to be careful not
to get one a fake one so avoid Amazon
warehouse these assorted versions
offered maybe there's some business
getting clones from China for two euros
swapping them and then yeah selling them
someone else I don't know but the
difference to the ones I had before is
shocking they don't really like like
they should while this other one was
really just some crap looking exactly
the same yeah but it was I thought it
was defective otherwise one side would
sound different it sounded the same on
both sides just really really crappy so
this is my take on the one more triple
driver headphone tuned by Luca VAR d see
some granite people severely are still
allowed in acquire and Yamaha better una
birra so it's a decent in-ear but not my
preferred one let's say switching baton
back and forth I was listening for hours
yesterday also trying to improve my mod
I had toilet paper before which told
again and again so I started to use this
other stronger material but I needed
four layers to get the correct amount of
filtering so yeah I hope this was again
helpful bit stay tuned for more reviews
coming of my entertaining videos sorry
if I bore you but there are so many
other
on YouTube check them instead so thanks
for watching and soon another video meet
maybe some surprises coming have a nice
direct bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
