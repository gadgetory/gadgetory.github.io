Center in Vienna I can do a first quick
preview of the new Bose Soundlink mini -
as you can see at first sight it looks
as if not much has changed this is the
old version the Soundlink mini one
there's a sounding mini - and it's
available in two colors now which is
what I would call some kind of grey and
another one close to well black the new
one can be finally charged through
microUSB while the old one needed a
proprietary charger you can also see
that the control field here is
completely new the new one has a new
function button and there are some new
functions that we'll see when we turn it
on battery 80% connected to Lana's iPad
our newly and iPhone 6 oli and as you
can see voice prompts on you now usually
I'm not a big fan of voice prompts but
in case of the Bose Soundlink mini -
they are pretty helpful because you can
cycle through a Bluetooth devices it
automatically connects to two but if you
have more paired devices you can well
with the Bluetooth button you can cycle
between them this is pretty helpful
especially because usually Bluetooth is
not very user friendly if you have more
devices to pair with but it's already
connected to my iPad and to my iPhone so
we can start playing music
and the new button here can pause
playback or continue playback double
pressing takes you'll attract further
triple pressing takes you back okay this
was double this is triple and it has
hands-free included something
the first version didn't have of course
I would like to see if they sound any
different and I took some measurements
as you can see black is the old
Soundlink mini I measured it at three
different levels the first one being
slightly below half then another one at
about 3 3/4 and at maximum volume and
here at gray you can see the Bose
Soundlink mini tool and the general
attuning is still pretty similar but a
Bose took away a little bit of bass it's
about I think 2 DB so it's not much but
you notice it if you hear them directly
I think this is a good step format
because the old sounding mini was pretty
heavy the new one sounds a bit better
but what I would criticize is that it's
still missing treble you can see from
the measurements not much has changed
here and at levels slightly above above
half it becomes a bit out of control
bass is starting to to drone and to
distort so well I'm a bit surprised that
both didn't change it more and I thought
we will have a listen to both to see how
they compare in reality and if you hear
some difference so I selected some
tracks to hear I'm starting with the
Soundlink mini 2 and then we'll switch
over to the Soundlink mini
well the sounds still pretty similar so
not much has changed let's listen
another to another crack and one of the
bigger problems is I think the
directionality if you listen
it comes to rather bull sounding if you
don't aim it directly at you so this
problem has remained they didn't change
anything
for example the next strike you will
hear that the bass is starting to well
become a bit out of control
or this one
and as seen from the measurement the
lower you turn it the more base you will
get which will start to disappear
the higher your training so okay this
was a first preview of the Soundlink
mini to summarize not much has changed
but the new features are really welcome
especially USB charging also the control
field and hands-free so if you still
don't own a Bose Soundlink mini you
should check out the Bose Soundlink mini
2 or if you don't need all this fancy
stuff maybe you can get old and old
Soundlink mini at some discount they
still sound pretty much the same
although the new one is newer with newer
features but sound wise the difference
is rather marginal I would say so I hope
this helped a little bit and yeah I will
show a very nice summer the next video
will be probably the introduction of the
speaker audio database so stay tuned a
little bit and see you then bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
