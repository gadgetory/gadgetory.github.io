look at another xiaomi speaker that i
ordered from china i hoped it would at
least come a bit close to the xiaomi me
we've already heard before this has
become something like my absolutely
favorite ultra portable speaker is it so
small that it fits into any pocket but
still sounds really decent and mature i
mean this is not a party speaker for
high levels but at low levels and some
background listening one of the very
best of course this is smart small and
also cheaper currently on the back good
store it costs $30 fifty but it's got
really great raving reviews you can see
most of them 5 stars just a single guy
from russia complained about the support
but you can have a look
design is really great all made out of
aluminium it can be hang somewhere it's
available in three colors in silver like
mine in gold and in grey and there is an
exploded view of the driver which i
thought it's really promising it came in
well without anything just a connected
box with some chinese manual and
although there is some hole for the
carrying loop there was no hearing loop
included no charging wire nothing at the
bottom you can see this is the charging
port micro USB and a power button but
before having a listen i thought we
would like to see how it measures as i
just finished some measurements and you
can see
well a big treble boost with a peak at
12 kilo hertz and below 400 Hertz there
is already some roll-off so you don't
really get any bass below 400 Hertz my
hope was of course that it would yeah be
a kind of scaled-down version of this
maybe but it's far away from this of
course we will have a listen i will turn
it on you should listen with headphones
I'm wearing binaural microphones so
headphones are really required for the
best results and I thought we'll listen
to some tracks from salt apprecia
which is salt a sauna together with
princess freesia I will start with the
small miniature me and then switch over
to the bigger Shalini so that you can
hear the difference so let's start
again you can hear this is just well
treble it habit sounds better than my
iPhone but let's switch over to the
bigger one and you can definitely hear
and much fuller sound the smaller one
again yeah Justin it off and my hope was
also that it would compete pretty well
against some other small means because
like this phone box here the topic of
this welcome tone is really horrible
thank goodness this one has no such
horrible tones but I think that boom box
still sounds a bit well better let's say
I would start again with the with the
Xiaomi I know what see what what it's
called it's called me portable Bluetooth
speaker so I would start again with this
one and another track from Seoul /
Frieza it's just rebel headphone box
not with more muffled are also cooler
maybe let's increase volume slightly on
the knee as well is less for me and I
know nothing it technically gives a more
muffled impression but it also sounds
more balanced at least there is slightly
more bass less travel which makes the
sraddha parts modality
let's try maximum there is some slight
distortion already yeah I think at
maximum the me has maybe an edge let's
write on a track so it does not distort
but it should be fumed
slightly differently both are playing
tricks on
this sounds a bit too harsh if you ask
me I mean at maximum if they reduced
treble slightly may be boosted bass at
lower level slightly with some DSP just
like they did on the bigger version this
could be some really nice speaker I mean
for $15 you maybe cannot expect too much
but I'm a bit disappointed to tell the
truth I expected more especially I hoped
for some loop to be hanging but which
was not included in my case yet design
and and build quality definitely very
very nice but the sound is not really
there yeah let's see what Xiaomi comes
up next maybe some other version of this
I don't know but this didn't really
impress me much for $15 you will
definitely find much better speakers so
yeah I hope this was helpful to give you
an idea about the Xiaomi portable or me
I don't know thanks all for watching and
we'll see us in the next video bye-bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
