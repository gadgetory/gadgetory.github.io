going to check out a speaker from
empower or Nepal no idea how to
pronounce it also no idea what's the
real model name here it says MP bh o 6
for a be other things looks really
promising great designs very simple but
nice build quality also this titanium
light color is really nice you can see
two drivers here to passivate us on
Amazon it goes currently for 47 dollars
and you can see dual 10 watt drivers
enhanced bass HD audio and so on there
are just two reviews but on the German
Amazon Spada many more and all seem to
be quite impressed with it also this one
here this is an excellent product very
impressive so it would be of course
interesting to know how it sounds
let's look at the packaging very very
simple also here battery up to 8 hours
and so on so yeah yeah let's turn it on
maybe yeah all these standard terms and
it's pretty sticky so it really sticks
to the table probably but aesthetically
those are violating quite a lot and
before having enlistment comparing it to
some other speakers in this price range
I thought I will spoil this a little bit
with some frequency response measurement
and you can see well I would call this
maybe an inverse smiley response so you
can see base all you also get 300 Hertz
trailer also starts to roll off around 3
kilo Hertz so yeah this is not a
response I will treat out as neutral or
interesting usually you'd rather boost
base and boost treble the problem is
that the response remains always the
same regardless at which level you play
it so at low levels it sounds the same
as at maximum and although it does not
reduce the already and any place any
further it also introduces some
distortion maximum salt the sound is
really far from being impressive first I
hoped it would compete with all the
other comparables because in this price
range like this which were for here the
1020 and 12 which are around 50 $60 but
I decided to compare it rather to this
show meanie which is you can see half or
less than half the size price is
comparable but the show Nene has
you know features like SD card playback
so we will listen to these two first as
always I'm of course using banner on
microphones
therefore you should listen with
headphones and I will start with the
empowerment power or whatever first
attract from fo elements so personally
mix so please Evelyn
you can hear that the impulse sounds
thinner
despite being bigger also quite a bit of
strange compression going on the treble
has a little bit of a little character
let's Remi
an electric from salt Akana it's
connected to here as the N power start
applies some dynamic processing although
we are not even play playing high
volumes now here there n else is already
crystalline and if you use volume you
can hear that the sound remain the same
while the show-me need becomes quite a
bit more full-bodied
and what'd you say any further this
becomes really teeny of course at higher
levels is it does not reduce base and
form it will become fuller from a
certain point on hold it include rolling
slightly on both of course another show
me already reduces pain and this
transport Atlantic water
of course the show smoke meant to be
plated really high level I'm trying to
make once again and an outright meeting
and you can hear some strange clicking
crackling this is a great layer you want
to feel the ground needs to be some kind
of a limiter filthier which tries to
click the base down or something they
call me cousin included redistrict sound
like some animal limiter effect with
with a cool quick attack so yeah it's
really far from perfect piano track
also here you can hear that they show me
constantly better more open somehow more
spacious fuller
it's for you
you
you can also check out highway
the empower already playing the local
maximum the show-me is around 3/4 movie
project of course different volume
prayer for this this is the show me now
and I will increase volume to maximum
you can hear how it has to compress as
well that it prefers usable their
impulse so yeah the Xiaomi lost any
advantage thanks for their face
reduction
the empower definitely come to the home
not a trick but nevertheless when
looking at the size difference of both
it's quite interesting that their charm
can compete at all although this is far
from being some kind of full bodied pika
just so impressive because it's small
and still 20 cent but to demonstrate you
how it compares against the speaker like
this little f4 here which is from not
perfect but quite usable we should try
these two as well I will start again
with the with the M power and another
track so yeah a track from so person
again and you can hear the different
compresses with
I'm including slightly more gix increase
volume close connection I think that
compressor tries to to reduce volume or
track from Kentucky so maybe
and when we're using volume again it
becomes really anemic we have to tell
the truth looking at the at the design
and everything I expected quite a bit
more and better sound let's turn it off
so we hear how it yeah just do do do do
and I mean it's not bad or but it's not
better than many other cheetahs because
the only thing it really has is some
great look some great design but sound
quality's not there therefore I mean I
don't quite understand how all the
reviewers are so excited about it you've
heard there were some processing issues
with the day some clicking noises also a
lot of compression regardless of volume
level it seems if the input gain becomes
too high the limit or compressor puts
volume down when the song is softly
tries to push volume again so it's
really not that great and I would rather
avoid buying it
yeah I hope you like this I hope I could
give you an idea about the empower
whatever empower MTB mph o-64 a B the
beautifully it appears as empower I
think all six or something like this
again empower o 64 so yes nothing else
to say about the speaker looks really
great and I expected quite a bit more
performance those probably know these
people assessing at all inside therefore
it is the typical sound you get from all
the other cheap speakers
it's a bit more expensive prolly because
of this great build quality and
materials so again thanks a lot for
watching and see you in the next video
have a nice time it bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
