to give you a more detailed some
analysis of the Sony SRX xp7 index
before it just as promised also give you
some of my personal final thoughts about
them to conclude all this I hope this
won't become too boring for many as well
mostly so just frequency response
measurements but also demonstrating you
how the sound changes depending on the
volume level and how you can tweak them
to make them sound better as I think
that default structuring doesn't really
use the full potential but thank
goodness there is this song palette
which lets you adjust the sound a little
bit which is then saved within the
speaker so this kind no sound samples
sorry for that but you can check them
out already to mine speaker audio
database included both of them and I
recorded them with three different
settings one is their flat neutral
tuning one is with extra bass and one is
with my custom tuning where I think they
sound a little bit better the tuning or
the EQ setting is visible on the right
side of the speaker so check them out
there and compare and compare them
against from other speakers as I think
both are really promising but I
definitely prefer their XP 30 it's
smaller it's lighter sounds great has
great bass similar to the XP 14 which is
just louder but doesn't sound as we find
there is some treble problem which we'll
see later on to the frequency response
measurement unfortunately Sony may be
castrated it's a little bit the input
power input is just 5 volts but it still
needs a proprietary charger which is of
course annoying and also battery life is
may be great but also here Sony with
some strange power saving algorithms as
the speaker at maximum will just play
for three and a half hours then it will
reduce volume to around 30% but will
continue to play for 12 hours at this
level so not sure what they were
thinking I'm sure they could have easily
squeezed out 5 6 hours at maximum and
then yeah the speaker would turn off but
with these energy saving algorithms they
are just ridiculous the XP varies a
little bit louder
especially when you tweet the sound also
I think it's it sounds better than the
xb3 doesn't compress as much on the X is
three already at half volume
to swallow or or attacks which they
experienced early doesn't or it does it
as well but it's not as noticeable
especially with extra base but we will
see this to some frequency response
measurements apart from that yeah the
light main if you like them or not you
simply turn them off I find them a
little bit annoying as they don't flash
wood together with the music but that
just do their own show and the light
doesn't seem to affect the battery life
at all I tried maximum volume with both
lights enabled and disabled and both
times after 3 hours 25 it reduced volume
so it really doesn't matter there seems
to be some timer obviously something
really didn't want to give you a great
speaker but then they thought yeah let's
let's simply cut volume by 70% and let
their speaker play for I'm really not
sure why they did this maybe to really
reach 12 or 13 hours exclaims but it's
just a really bit fake
so these are the points which I find a
little bit annoying without this volume
reduction this would be really a great
spice because it's really one of the
loudest you've maybe heard it in my
outro video it rather than a Rio TX of
course with a lil bit more distortion
but I selected a little bit subpar
tracks which which from
nocopyrightsounds with lots of
compression already so this because
dragged little bit but you can hear it
in my speak earlier the dippers compared
it against some others like that sharply
and you will notice that with the custom
tuning the XP thoroughly inspected in
the order with better bass and also less
distortion so checking the frequency or
less the sound
overall a little bit strange as Sonic
Youth both not perfectly well but thanks
to the SAP sample app you can help to
make it sound a wee bit better I thought
I will concentrate more than exterior as
I will definitely
we prefer this one over the xba-40 which
is just louder hi small bass but doesn't
sound that great it doesn't offer you
this this convincing - I like sound
which the XP 30 with some additional
tuning can give you
unfortunately the sound changes a lot
depending on on the volume level at
lower levels you get some bass boost
which is of course nice because of human
loudness controls which which simply a
human ear becomes less sensitive for low
frequencies at low levels so sonic boost
bass but at levels above half it reduces
bass too much then you have extra bass
which you can enable to overcome this
but at low levels you cannot use extra
basis sit boost bass way too much with
15 15 or 20 DB so let's check out maybe
some frequency response measurements
here I have the flat coming at exactly
half volume and you can see ya treble
little bit missing there is a bit too
much bass at 200 Hertz and below hunters
bass is a little bit too soft if you
look at some lower levels you can see
that there is some slight bass boost not
too much but at levels above half it's
obvious that bass adduction is way too
much now looking at the measurement with
extra bass enabled you can see that bass
is boosted unfortunately upper base is
boosted as well at low levels you can
see there is way too much bass boost the
speaker starts to drown and sound balmy
while a higher level space is retained
much longer
still trouble is a bit missing but if we
take the sample and boost travel to
maximum we get this curve here and also
boosted based on maximum you can see the
speaker measures March lateral there is
still some dip at around six seven
kilowatts but it's already much better
than it was before without any eq
adjustment
upper base is still a little bit too
much as you can see we managed to raise
bass below hundred Hertz and a bit also
at low levels we have slightly more bass
boost and before so at low levels it
sounds warmer and clearer at the same
time at Tyler's there is still too much
bass reduction therefore at levels above
half I will definitely apply extra bass
and you can see our custom tuning with
bass and treble at maximum together with
extra bass enabled it have volume there
is maybe too much bass boost now but at
levels up to maximum we avoid a too
strong
basically
like this so as you can see the speaker
definitely needs some adjustment Tori
sounds great
the first thing I would do is boost
treble to maximum and adjust bass to
your liking while keeping exobase off
for levels below half above half I would
simply turn on extra bass it sounds a
little bit better with extra bass turned
on and bass reduced completely within
yet but then if you turn it higher you
would need to to start the app again and
boost bass so I think the most general
and best setting is simply prevalence
maximum basic maximum and extra bass
above half volume everything below with
extra bass turned off for auto use you
could also enable extra bass at lower
levels as it will give you this full
basically sound but it needs some
adjustment without this what's that
flattening it sounds just a bit average
you should also hear this - my speaker
audio database looking at the X before
you know it has slightly deeper bass not
as much the problem here is that it
would have definitely benefit from some
some tweeters the treble is just off it
sounds muffled there is some peak at
around ten kilos so also you're looking
at some measurements you can see that at
our volume it's similar to the experi
but there is a strong lower treble it
between 3 and 18 at me if you can see
there is some slight emphases between 9
10 kilohertz but above this trail is
completely missing looking at some lower
levels also here's some slight bass
boost but even the XP 40 reduces bass
too much at higher levels now if you
enable extra base on the X before you
can see that a little bit changes here
so the upper base at 3 400 Hertz gets
reduced well know what bass gets boosted
you get a nice response down to 50 Hertz
over again at low levels way too much
bass boost with extra days enabled well
I think so exobase the speaker can
retain more bass at higher levels now
the only thing you can do with the X
before you to make it sound a bit better
is also boost Guero to maximum but you
will also boost this peak at 10
kilohertz which makes the travel a
little bit resonant so I really don't
like it that much
so it has more punchy bass and retains
more bass at higher levels than expected
but for normal listening there xp3 keeps
your
much better sound alone both a little
bit directional so they really sound
best when in circulate the listener
off-axis slightly you lose quite a bit
of travel definition so in the meantime
I really prefer they're both something
evolved over the explicitly if I don't
need highest levels the thousand evolved
gift set perfect sound from all angles
although they're explicitly would
definitely be a better sounding speaker
overall still I'm a bit disappointed
that Sony had to go with the strange
battery saving mode three and a half
hours at maximum either Big Shot
especially if the speaker can play for
another 12 hours at the lower volume I'm
sure they could have easily squeezed out
for five hours it makes them Auto rate
still I think it's a pretty impressive
speaker special now it's Best Buy Haslem
on offer I think for $119 so definitely
a better deal then I will be charged
three with a better overall sound higher
loudness and just weaker battery life
maybe Salah did this on purpose to
simply be able to sell another XP 300 in
another year I also think it's better
than the xp3 um maybe I can smack and
xp3 and we can do a direct comparison as
you can of course compare both from my
speaker database and you could do shoot
here that the Xperia place much better
with more dynamics also a letter sound
over so I hope this was helpful little
bit and thanks for watching have a nice
time and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
