going to check out the brand-new bangle
doll of Cynthia play a to active Ben
Dobson has released this obviously for
more active people for out to use and so
on as its claimed to be waterproof
splash resistant also dust proof but as
you can see not much has changed just
the grip which was leather is now some
kind of material but the good thing is
it can now be charged through micro USB
this is a USB see just like on the a1
and it's claimed to be charged within
three hours which is of course nice as
then in the leakage I have here needs
appropriate a charge on the leakage is
not waterproof or something but the
material of the a2 active is exactly the
same as it was before so as you can see
it doesn't stand that stable if it falls
off on concrete or something it will
probably damage and scratch but yeah of
course we would like to know if
something else has changed
also if battery life is better but first
maybe let's check out some frequency
response measurement and as you can see
not much has changed it's still measures
far from flat or neutral but in contrast
to the older version you get some
dynamic bass boost for low levels so the
a2 active definitely sounds fatter and
more full-bodied at low levels then the
old version did now if we compare the a
tool to the daily catch overlaid here
you can see that the catch measures
quite a bit flatter and more natural
with a similar bass post for low levels
and the de leakage can play quite a bit
louder although this results in a more
pumping and also compressed sound of
course I would like to show you how the
sounds is always amusing binaural
microphones so you should listen Ted
phones the first thing I noticed from
the a2 was that the stereo separation
was quite a bit better than on the catch
I would like to show you this with a
classic track from Pink Floyd so please
have a listen I'm starting with the a2
active first
so maybe you can hear it it's not just a
front back stereo but you indeed get
also some left-right separation if I
switch over to there's a leakage the
stereo width is far not as obvious
people is listen to an acoustic piano
jazz track to hear how natural balls
sound
the
and I think you can hear that their
catch has more body to the sound also a
more natural frequency response the
piano sounds like a real piano
while this has some strange honking nice
and hollow mess just like it wasn't
there a - and the previous version
this is definitely more mature another
vocal Jeff strike yeah I think also you
can hear that the voice sounds more
natural from the dummy catch something
else
something smooches track the catch also
sounds more dynamic
while the a tool active starts
swallowing stronger attacks nano track
although if you listen close you will
hear that their limit ah already starts
pushing down that Peaks as well here
maybe the check how they disperse the
signs of exes as both our 360-degree
speakers
the into appears quite a bit more treble
heavy
no trick
some kind of rock
something else also some nice
spaciousness
data leakage it has the same spatial
sound maybe not as broad but some other
trick it sounds a bit fuller I will
reduce volume on both we are slightly
below half for the leakage while the a2
already plays above half let's heavily
small get this the de leakage has
slightly more upper base so a fuller
sound overall but both definitely sound
quite full-bodied at low level
I will try matching them again
and in our track also from savasana
the a2 has the strange honking is or
which the videos version head as well
that's all a little bit more emphasis on
treble so it sounds a little odd
let's try some house track D pause I
think um here is that the bass is
somehow fuller from the dolly cache not
necessarily deeper just a more
full-bodied sound
another trick from savasana which is a
very dynamic recording the bass drum
usually makes most smaller speakers
straddle the delicate they still sound a
bit fuller and we can check what happens
if we increase volume so we are around
half the catch starts to count a little
bit there a tool has another kind of
compression the a to start sounding a
bit thinner but at the same time without
this strange pumping
I will increase volume it more you can
hear it
although the catch can retain more bass
but it without an estranged pumping song
this sounds a bit Highland outs and also
spinners let's try another place that
will increase volume for maximum of the
step 8 - active now fill some nice lower
base
let me catch ya I would increase it to
make some as well but it came here
Anamika struggles in this case
so the different approaches the a tool
just reduces bass and compresses all the
peaks while the catch tries to hold them
but you will get the strange bumping
sound not sure if they really manage to
correct this with some future update
let's run IV another track also again
fizzle bottom for maximum you can use
this not very visible
we have to reduce volume it is three
four notches to get a normal result
it's righty acoustic track again which
is not as bass heavy and let's see how
they perform at maximum with that kind
of music
there is still some pumping but then
catch is also quite a bit louder
although the base from here is a swallow
away
while the dolly cage still plays it yeah
both are not really perfect for high
levels which is of course a pity I hoped
then dollops would have improved
something for the a tool which was
already not that great I thought they
would maybe improve that yuning slightly
make it more natural without these
strange humps and dips
yeah they boosted base for low levels
which of course is nice as autos you
always need some more base but it still
sounds quite the same as it was before
with lots of compression at at high
levels I mean they really iron out all
Peaks which doesn't give you this
pumping sound from the catch but yet
it's not really exciting for example v I
think he gives you a much more dynamic
sound at higher levels also playing
place much louder with more bass the
other problem the old a2 head was a
really weak battery for high levels yeah
it didn't improve either so you get the
same battery life as it was before I
tested it at maximum and I got one hour
18 until it turned off but after a 58
minutes it already reduced volume to
half so you get one hour at maximum and
for auto use where you simply need these
higher levels yeah it's a little bit
disappointing
I hope they could maybe have improved it
but they didn't it's even worse as with
the old version I got 150 now one hour
18 the leakage done reduces volume and
it will play for around two hours 40 it
makes a model yet with the strange
pumping effect so both are really not
perfect if you really need these high
levels but for lower levels up to let's
say half volume they are both great the
a tool doesn't sound as natural is the
dahle cage but it's still pretty
exciting and much better than many other
speakers but you also of course have to
pay this price it's 399 just the same
like the dolly catch and yeah I mean you
really have to know what you need and
what you want for outdoor use it's not
the best speaker
despite yet being an active speaker but
it's not as wracked as many others
rugged sorry the fugu XL is about as
loud but sounds better at maximum fuller
is a completely water resistant
and yeah and costless of course it's a
bit larger and also heavier but I think
for overall let's say general use I
prefer the daily catch as it sounds
simply more natural more - this has the
strange honking noise - the sound which
they didn't really improve a lot but
it's also okay if you don't have this
comparison I'm sure many will be
satisfied with a - and just disappointed
by the battery life at high levels
if you don't play that maximum but let's
say 70 80 % you will maybe get to 3
hours which is also a bit disappointing
yeah of course we will test the a2 also
against the a1 as now with this dynamic
bass boost the a tool definitely the a2
active became much better than it was
before
so the a1 now starts to sound a little
bit lost
although the a1 still can play louder
which is impressive as it's much smaller
but we will check this out in another
video maybe we will also put it against
the JBL extreme which is not the best
comparison but I know that many were
interested in hearing the AV a2 active
or the old a2 against the G bit extreme
we already heard the a2 against ful
sinky also against a fuga Excel so the
extreme will be maybe the last one we
will compare it to yeah I hope you liked
it I hope it could give you some insight
into the new a2 active not much has
changed
just this micro you are USB C port which
can be used for charging widgets of
course welcome I mean you don't need to
carry around another charger and the
grip tuning wise not that much has
changed just a little bit more bass
boost at low levels and battery life is
as disappointing as it was before so
thanks a lot for watching see you in the
next video and have a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
