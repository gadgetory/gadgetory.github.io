interesting fight
JBL against JBL well in reality both are
really great speakers but for different
tastes the JBL charge 2 or even that two
plus they sound the same is more boosted
it has a more sounded frequency response
while the fleet 3 is flatter but also
doesn't reach that deep bass wise if we
have a short look at the frequency
response of both you see that the flip
three measures pretty flat while the JBL
charge 2 and the 2 plus have some boost
at the bass and some treble boost so it
depends what you want that flip 3 also
has the new JBL connect feature which
lets you connect it with another one for
stereo you can also connect it with an
JBL extreme the JBL charge 2 on the
other hand has the ability to charge
external devices also the battery is
quite a bit stronger here I think it has
twice the battery life I measured both
at maximum volume and got about three
and a half from the JBL feed 3 and more
than 6 hours from the JBL charge tool so
of course I would like to demonstrate
you how both sound as always I'm using
binaural microphones
therefore please use headphones for
listening I will start with the JBL flip
3 and then switch over to the charge to
heaven listen
Oh
I whisper in your ear the things that
you hear much more punch from the
JBO trash to simply more bass more
boosted face
let's try some kind of flop
you
you
some jazz funk I will try increasing
volume a little bit let's try the
distress and I increase the clip three
for maximum slide is this maximum on the
charge tool you'll hear that there's
quite a bit of dynamic compression going
on
I will try to match both loudness wise
again and let's try this track and have
a listen how different they sound you
hear all the dynamics the drums the
snare and now the table touch to the
snare has disappeared
flip again sure it's not as bass-heavy
but it still sounds like the original
source while that charge to tries to to
keep most of its base and well it
struggles I will increase volume to
maximum again charge to
yeah I hope this could give you a first
impression I mean both are really nice
but both sound different and probably a
matter of taste which one to choose I
like both but meanwhile I really prefer
the flip three also because it has this
nice this nice how do you call it a well
loop so I often just attach it to my
rucksack or even to my trousers and
listen to music when I'm walking and so
on
yeah thanks for watching guys and see
you next time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
