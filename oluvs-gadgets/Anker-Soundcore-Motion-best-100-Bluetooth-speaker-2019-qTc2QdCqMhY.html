so 2018 is becoming really exciting with
the speaker here we already had two
great releases for this year like the
Marshall Stockwell two other era a new
boom but the new anchor some commotion
classic food again becomes something
like a top performer in this class and
category what price range around hundred
dollars let's look at the packaging it
says immersive high resolution sound
room filling sound with 30 watts of
power 12-hour playtime fully waterproof
can be paired with another one charging
is done by USB see which of course is
nice and I would like to compare it to
some other speakers that we already know
like the JBL charge for more expensive
mono they're down via one of my
favorites and their Sony Xperia T which
could also be helped with Oh Hannah
Dallas and still an evergreen maybe but
I think the anchor performs on a better
level and I would like to make this as a
kind of live video showing you the
floors and also features I will grab my
TJ m or DJI Osmo action maybe you
noticed with some of my previous videos
there is there seems to be some back
with the image stabilization called
Rocksteady so during the video sampling
it fails so it turns off disables or
something I hope it won't happen this
time I already reported this to DJI I
hope they will come up with some
solution but I think it's simply a back
so after some period the stabilization
turns off so I will also use my banner
microphones you should of course this
with headphones put them up and let's
check them out first let me turn it on
so you can hear the nice welcome tones
which unfortunately be too loud and
there is no option to turn them off but
I think they're quite nice and not too
distracting I will start with a track
from savasana to this region analog the
speaker's playing with its default
settings now which is extra bass enabled
you can also disable extra bass with a
button the center button here all this
music or start it again and double
pressing jump to the next track and you
have the app with maybe I will make it a
bit dark as you can see this better so
this is more bass without base here we
have voice heavy classical and original
and project norm of them sounds really
that great so if you have a look at some
frequency response measurements this is
with extra bass enabled you can see that
it doesn't measure that well with an
extra bass
yeah you'll lose all bass and the good
thing is that you have an user
adjustable equalizer which I will turn
on now so I will use volume elevated and
with this user equalizer you can make
the sound quite appealing I try to make
it a lot of flat sounding so this is the
measurement you can see for this user EQ
you can of course adjust it a little bit
better maybe butter is in three kilo
Hertz band missing so you can see it's a
nine band equalizer and we have 700
Hertz 1 kilo Hertz and the next is 5
kilo I saw it with 3 kilohertz you would
maybe manage to to adjust this hump at 3
chords but I think it's already way
nicer than it was before
problem is that now the other settings
somehow adopt your user EQ so it doesn't
sound like it did when you turn it on
still I think with this setting it
sounds really nice
and let's compare it today really
popular JB a church for us that's the
strap which many people are but I think
it's not really worth the money so this
is the JBL now
it can be income
it's a more speaker missing a Twitter
with just one single driver so it sounds
all soft like this
that's what's nothing else it doesn't
have any stellar processing so the
steric effect you're getting is just
because of the driver layout there is no
no no DSP would've gone on here but the
GPL is just one although the frequency
response is okay I would say it simply
mess this is an error any trouble spot
also sounds a bit boxy maybe because of
the single driver and more pressure
so the incarnation does a better job
here that's why this track
the tube you
this is a way nicer sound here that
you're getting but I don't think many
JPL users all of us will listen to jazz
so let's try this reading some dub
reggae or whatever yeah and you can hear
it just doesn't sound good with others
of what other people are claiming it's
not a great speaker and the nice thing
is that also at lower levels it boot
space dynamically so you will get even
more bass a fatter sound while if I do
this with the JBL let me try it this is
the first volume step which is off yeah
so this definitely sounds bigger so
let's increase volume again like this at
the GPO as well
and Patrick
Geo
yes something is somehow boring and so
let's listen what happens at higher
levels this is the anchor increasing
volume to maximum becomes pretty loud
and distorted the JBL
so this is quite a difference I'd say
yeah
no Distortion
I'm sorry for the box here DN car
completely blows for JD in a way here
you can order get some information here
because of the sweetest business on JBL
let's try this right here
we're from another nation maybe some
threat from NCAA
energy here is also compress that much
delicious face lightly
Papaji via becomes slaughter boy this is
really maximum I mean I bump everything
so the jailer is no reference at all
maybe let's try that their own in Baia
without thought that anon is awareness
of sounding in a more musical speaker
than the JBL also because of its
enhanced air processing so let's have a
listen how these two compare I will
start again with the ankus on commotion
plus and an Alfred from savasana
increases freedom
get them on
has this nice starless on stage here so
the anchor doesn't do this but I think
it still sounds really nice
ank again kasi food justly if you even
in Farah this is not a final cure so
there is lots of way to improve the
sound I'll change the center liking so
if it's to pay service into the new
space I posted very slightly to make it
a little bit more or to make it sound
bigger arrogant
some effect
it doesn't solve off in any way
especially with the use IQ and I think
it's a matter of taste you to look more
done
puts a bit more emphasis on needs also
because of this enhanced air processing
it sounds broader and maybe a slight
more exciting this one is
it's the dental sounds very nice but
let's listen effects is nearly found
slightly above so the anchor should have
some slight advantage because of the
dedicated tweeters
but the demo really does a nice job here
being more than one year okay that's why
this sometimes it cuts off the first
second of the song so we would have to
to to revive back but many people
speakers builders
but you my love I do most anything but
you sweet baby I'll do most everything
come son and I hope you feel the same
way my mom the ocean
just my sweet
you gave me milk
so the denim can't compete with things
so if it's too they say for you the
encryption always turn it down so if you
get a deeper sound a fuller sound
somehow
also slightly more dynamic maybe that's
what this our metal fans do shop here
if the frequency response is often
anyway
don't Broder but
they both sound quite soon understand
as I can hear the indicated space from
better
that's right this
here it doesn't have this this this
dynamic dynamic sounds maybe listen
listen how they perform at higher levels
again so this is the denim and I will
increase volume formation slowly
there long as it makes him more
Janka quite a big audience also still
more dynamic
which are this
you can hear otherwise the room is it's
softer
those are sounds more processed in we
are way more tips on the base runner
so I am pretty sure many will or would
like to hear it against the Sony Xperia
so let's compare these two the Sony SRX
sp30 despite being quite an old speaker
already still I think performs quite a
bit better than the recent offerings
from Sony like the XP 31 and 32 it's
playing with my personal EQ settings
which is based and traveled maximum with
extra bass disabled below half volume
and enabled above half I will start
again with the anchors on commotion plus
and an hour trek from Sophos on princess
filter from the latest album you can
hear this volume level we are exactly
half the truth maybe already need extra
bass but this makes it quite cool and
still the emotion class has more
definition to the base and also to
travel and so on
so in sons of it's only money or boxing
tracting without exobase face is missing
although IQ space to make sure you can
hear it somehow has more kick more
effective a face from here this one is
some offices could base more so this has
more body here and I would like to
increase volume again just you have
quite a heavy track so the Sony is just
a single driver design so the anchor
still sounds nice here it's only
increasing going to maximum
an antic in here he always taught us
with rebels so if they do take a
treatise on Bianca definitely has period
once that is
air can hear only already salsa tips
right business dynamics
so the emphasis in much better job
Yanis audience really of mixing I only
was loved
so the angkot also blows away this year
those effects is quite a bit so yeah
this happens when the camera gets out of
juice during shooting sorry for that
but I think you could hear anyhow that
the anchor sound commotion class
outperformed the sony xperia regarding
power and loudness with the sony not
being really dead bet outperforming the
JBL charge file and many others because
in the size so the anchor does a really
great job with less distortion at
maximum and more dynamic sound so this
two-way tweeter designed definitely
helps here the sony with just the single
driver and into drivers or the JBL
charge for which has just a single
driver i mean i'm all is the same size
so JBL is asking more money for a single
driver while here you get four of them
and a better sound more loudness but
there is one catch the user adjustable
equalizer is not saved within the
speaker this is the biggest problem so
you have to readjust the equalizer again
after power on I already reported this
to anchoring because I think with its
default tuning it doesn't sound that
great I would like to show you the
frequency response measurements again
here would face up without place up and
with my personal EQ and you can see that
with the user adjusted the equalizer you
can squeeze out more sound of it make it
flatter more natural at low levels you
get some dynamic bass adjustment while
at items of course some bass reduction
so it definitely means the user
adjustable equalizer to sound good and I
hope
anka we listen and release a firmware
update because the default tuning is not
that great I don't like it that much but
if
adjust it to your liking it outperforms
most others maybe not the down on it
till has a more refined sound also
because of this enhanced sterile
processing so the anchor doesn't do this
but you could hear maybe it sounds not
as hollow with mates also trevor has a
little bit
more natural characteristics the denon
has some metallic character to it maybe
because of the Twitter's I'm not sure
and you could hear from from the JBL
that it's added quite a lot of high
levels with some intermodulation
distortion so the anchor doesn't have
these problems I try to really the
heaviest track so it makes one there
might be some slight dirtiness but we
know the strong is from the Sony
so it makes the Sony obsolete which was
a really a great performer below hundred
dollars so the anchor gets my olaf's
award is a best sub hundred dollar
speaker for summer 2019 I'm sure many
will will ask to compare it against the
gloss on box Excel I think this is an
overall a better performer maybe not as
deep with bass but simply more control
to more constant more consistent you can
check it out from my database compared
against any other speaker I think it
does a really great job if the sound is
adjusted slightly with the user view the
Sony save seat settings so this not and
not sure if this was just some oversight
or if they didn't want design is great
charging with USB C is also great it's
not sure if it's it is just less
resistant or if it's ipx7 rated so you
can submerge it underwater I wouldn't do
it but it definitely would survive so I
think it's a great speaker and I'm not
quite sure why many would still buy the
JBL here for more the only advantage it
could have is maybe at maximum volume so
I squeezed out more than six hours while
here around three and a half at maximum
but being of course also louder so if I
will reduce volume to to such a level as
the JBL it would also maybe get four
four and a half maybe five hours so I
haven't found any issues any problems
any flaws just that you need to equalize
the sound a little bit with the app then
it's saved within the speaker but after
power up it loses the setting again and
this is my my only point of criticism
otherwise I think it performs on a
similar level as the demo being cheaper
and in some regards even better
it's louder more punchy more dynamic and
somehow a little bit more natural enemy
the denim on the other hand has this
nice processed so but I'm quiet
yeah not shocked but I'm quite surprised
how well the ankus on commotion plus
developed or became it's really nice
speaker and I would like to thank anchor
again for providing this sample it took
them more than a month to send it so in
the meantime I got another one by myself
as I wanted to hear it I heard some some
praise from others and then they arrived
the same day so I won't keep both
although they supports their pairing I
don't need to one is enough you could
hear it's already louder than than the
others and still sounding great it loses
some basic maximum which is normal these
small tiny drivers cannot move I don't
know like crazy but it still sounds
sounds ok and better than the others at
maximum therefore in this size and price
a top performer if not the best
currently I'm really curious to see what
the competition will bring but I highly
doubt that there will be many
outperforming the anchor now yet just
please please anchor release a firmer
update which would save the settings
within the speaker so I don't need to
hassle around and also maybe an option
that I can turn off the status tones
otherwise it is close to perfect I like
it a lot and I mean it won't be possible
that easily but the user adjustable EQ
would need a 3 kilohertz band then you
could really find him the sounding
better now it's 9 bands so a 10th band
with 3 kilohertz or two and a half would
be great to make the sound even even
more high-end so yeah I hope you liked
this little video I hope it could give
you an idea about the sound how it
performs against the competition and
this will be definitely my last video
with the GBA chat for it simply can't
compete against anything all the other
old speakers blow it blow it away
completely outperform it and now with
the anchor being cheaper slightly
heavier the JBL is a disaster
it's just horrible so
and not quite sure about the hype I mean
JBL the charge rate was great three
years ago or something but the charge
for a step backwards in regarding
everything it has a slightly smoother
sound and then JB a charge three but
it's mono it's not as loud you could
hear as performed by a much cheaper
speaker even sounding veteran so yeah
thanks all for watching I will try to
include it in my future videos if there
is some competing model but I highly
doubt anything will be able to compete
in this size check it out again from a
database compare it against what hundred
dollars those sound box Excel or yeah
compare it against this highly praised
Fender Newport I think this sounds
definitely nice if the song is adjusted
slightly yeah thanks all for watching
and see you in the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
