results for a fourth planned missile
test it was the premium portable class
portable because yeah they are also
pretty portable and we head against some
golden gears who had also correctly
others did not so well so there may be
some surprises but yet please check it
by yourself
Oh
and
okay
I think it was pretty obvious that
speaker B which was placed if I think he
was by far the best in this test they
were already playing a slightly elevated
level so only the FIFA could really keep
up here the Sony already introduces some
distortion at levels above half you
could also hear this from my full review
the dolly catch also a great sounding
speaker at lower levels but as soon as
you turn it past half it reduces all
bass also thanks to the Sony directional
sound it sounds more diffused than B so
it is bit strange sounding compared to
the c-4 to the Sony and the Hong Kong on
the other hand is nothing exceptional
but it does nothing really badly so it's
just a normal sounding speaker but
nothing really outstanding so
congratulations to all those who really
hit all four correctly you can maybe
tell us how you managed if you compare
them to a database or you simply managed
by hearing them yeah others may be
surprised about there is a leakage rate
definitely a nice sounding speaker but
the end don't turn it past half
otherwise it sounds just a bit
subpar especially here compared against
the FIFA it cannot complete the FIFA
always remains the same sound lies just
it's very let's say close to maximum it
to us so maybe we're using bass lightly
but there's already a top volume you can
see that there is lots of DSP processing
and time yes
thanks a lot to everyone who took part
who tried guessing I hope you you won't
be disappointed about the results but
the FIFA is indeed a very impressive
speaker and I still love it although at
low levels I would have preferred it
also warmer you can help with a little
bit of EQ just put 70 Hertz the typical
JBL harman kardon 70 Hertz boost so
boost 70 Hertz by some DBM people sound
warmer at low levels
otherwise it's tuned for a reflex
response without any any bass boost
therefore for low levels where the human
ear becomes less sensitive for low
frequencies you would expect a bit more
bass but here it keeps always the same
sound so no dynamic adjustment yeah
which is a little bit of a pity but FIFA
obviously tries a more high file or pure
istic approach to speak attuning without
any boost and phone yeah you can see how
I also know that many people like it
with new flow quite a lot at low levels
for me with neutral at low levels it's
it sounds like some kicks rail so thanks
again I hope you liked it so far another
test maybe the last one is coming which
will be the ultra portable class with
really small speakers like the JBL go
also cheap speakers and we will see how
these fare so have a nice time and bye
bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
