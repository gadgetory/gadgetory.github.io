new album from savasana improves vision
of the game was released yesterday I had
the pleasure to be able to listen to it
early before so Kazama sent me a link so
pay this between several times I like it
a lot although it's a bit different than
the previous albums in a bit darker
they've also produced a video you can
see here and I thought we will have a
list of some pranks also watch a snippet
of the video but it would be quite lame
to simply play some samples therefore I
thought we'll recently through very
first token that I have here you can see
I set it up
you have course watched the whole video
on YouTube I posted a link in my video
description and now I thought we will
check out some other tunes from the
album I particularly like this one here
it's called hustle
Oh
ah
ah
you can hear it sounds a bit different
than the previous album or both also
these contracts like this one here
some smaller more like this
one called self-destruct
so yeah I don't want to play any further
tricks you can find the album on
Bandcamp or some items I think Amazon
you can hear it's a little bit darker
than usual it's more about depression
and about life so the current period
from so Poisson process which is not
that great they had three problems
setting this up financially and I think
the outcome is really great and I would
encourage everyone who likes this kind
of music some funky 70s groove a rare
groove yeah check it out if you haven't
pledged for the campaign for the Pledge
Music campaign I think later on
IndieGoGo because let's pledge music
somehow failed yeah I encouraged
everyone to support them and buy the
album you could also hear that the FIFA
every great job and quite satisfied with
it as a substitute for a sound bar
because I had different ones Philips
Samsung and although yeah they just
didn't sound good I mean they were not
suitable for listening to music and
listened to some movie I still didn't
get this immersive effect the Samsung
song by head last time has some real
speakers but anyhow I didn't somehow get
the cinema fitting therefore I thought
away with everything simply put the
fever here I set up the TV a litte bit
harder and not enjoying music and it's a
good here it's also connected to the TV
so it works as a kind of sound part yet
just wanted to tell you about the latest
album from South unprocessed future the
game also demonstrated again the son of
the FIFA Stockholm 2.0 which I like
quite a lot and
keep it yeah I hope you enjoyed it as
well have a nice time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
