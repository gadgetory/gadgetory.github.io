three different units of the same in a
model would sound completely different
this is the Samsung AG 955 a Samsung
earphones fueled by AKG I think it was
also bundled for free with the Samsung
is eight Samsung as night I made a video
about it as I think it sounds really
great
if you get a unit which sounds great so
this was the first unit that I got I got
it from Amazon for I think 14 euros it
came like this so no packaging just
wrapped into this plastic foil no
additional tips but this was the unit I
used for all my videos also comparing it
to some other ones and I think it sounds
really great then I thought I would like
to try it another one I ordered one from
ebay for around five six zeros it came
with this original packaging looks quite
authentic inside are also additional
tips so it looks genuine to me but it's
by far the worst sounding we will listen
later and then I thought I'll order
another one
again from some Amazon dealer form I
think also 10 euros came like this also
simple simple bag and they all look
original to me there is a site on
Samsung where it shows which one can be
distinguished as fake but these all look
equal to me but the sound is completely
different and I would like to
demonstrate to this with a song from
savasana increases feature
I use the same Sony image one tips for
all of them so yeah I really tried to
get the same fit with these ears here
for all of them but you will hear that
they sound completely different so let's
start with my unit that I used for all
my videos then with the second one here
from eBay and the third one from Amazon
and later on let's talk a little bit
about it
see
we can't be
so you could hear my first unit is the
only one which sounds normal
although a little bit bass-heavy but the
second one plays completely out of phase
somehow it was a waste softer than the
other ones
the third one of the other end has maybe
the nicest bass or not as bass heavy
also treble is a bit more boosted but
also again bass plays somehow out of the
face or it may be somehow phase shifted
between left and right because it's way
broader so I'm not quite sure
there seems to be lots of quality
control quality issue problems with this
therefore I really I cannot recommend it
because I don't know what you will get
if you order one mmm they really look
all authentic to me with no if some QR
codes here especially disappointed by
this one which came with this original
packaging and then it sounds like some
some broken crap yeah really horrible I
know I heard there were some quality
problems but the newer units bundled
with the s9 and so on should be okay so
who knows if these are some older units
from two or three years ago at least I
got one which sounds quite okay but the
other ones go immediately into the trash
because they are unusable maybe just for
to satisfy my curiosity I will order
further one simply to know how extreme
this sample variation released but it
seemed because I also know from some
yeah I have one it sounds horrible then
you probably got one of such units which
sound horrible they still are obviously
genuine or original but simply yeah have
some issue just wanted to show you this
because I get repeatedly comments yeah I
have one ending sounds like some cheap
earbud and this is not because I try to
sell you or tell you that it sounds
great but in rate it doesn't yeah it
seems that is really lots of sample
variation with this particular model
with this EKG was Samsung so Samsung
should correct
he hates really strange especially this
one as I had high hopes I thought hey it
looks so great and then I put it on and
it was playing out of phase somehow also
way software without bass so it's quite
an issue I would say Oh
if you get a great unit it sounds
definitely really green icing also yeah
I use this only tips here because I know
from some they have problems to feel it
the nozzle is quite quite short so some
don't get it deep inside inside the ear
but with the sauna tips these are the
largest ones they don't need to be to
stay
you just have to to clamp them inside to
get a nice seal you see I I don't put
them inside just have them here in my
ear opening and they stay nicely inside
sound also is improved over the original
tips which I don't like that much so
yeah yeah I hope this was helpful for
you
just be careful with buying and if you
buy one maybe from a trusted seller and
then also with an option to be able to
return it but if you get a good unit
it's definitely a really decent sounding
one especially compared to all this
hyped crap which cost even more yeah
thanks all for watching and see in the
next video bye bye
