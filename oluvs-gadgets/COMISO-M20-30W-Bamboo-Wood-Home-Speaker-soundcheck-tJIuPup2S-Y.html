today committed on booth to consider
shortlist maybe you remember and the
first impression was already quite a
disappointment unfortunately since then
not that much has changed or any kind of
breaking or burning didn't quite have an
effect still I wanted to give some more
details about it also including
frequency response measurements and
later on we'll do some further listening
the committee Adamu sticker cost $70 or
8 in this case with our coercion cost a
bit more and it concedes already quite
big and heavy I haven't measured it but
I think it's around one kilogram or even
more so from this size and weight you
would expect quite a bit better
performance for example if you have a
look at the reverse this cost just 20 or
$30 more is half the size and I think it
performs much better it's maybe not as
loud but we also have the Harman Kardon
onyx me the same price so we can find it
for 60 $70 and I also think that the
Harman Kardon onyx mini sounds way
better than this before I think at least
when comparing these you can also check
it out from my speaker audio database
I already included it and you can check
it against many other speakers and we
can also have a look at some frequency
response measurements and you can see
that at low levels there is some heavy
bass boost but it is also some problems
with travel if we increase volume bass
gets reduced more and more treble
remains the same so the sound remains
always quite a bit muffled but at higher
levels there is also some stronger
distortion introduced so overall the
sound of the kameez or bamboo speaker
small depth convincing I would say
therefore I would like to demonstrate
you how the communal sounds in reality
for this purpose I'm wearing binaural
microphones so you should listen at
headphones we'll compare it against
their Viva s first which is a bit more
of a hi-fi speaker it has also drivers
to the left and right so to avoid
blocking them I will put the river on
top here so they have some air to
breathe I will start with the first
songs and the community of play
incredibly 7 distance
come on track baby it all even told me
there's more people can do back and
forth but we can get back you can hear
some deeper bass as if you will notice
this mechanism doesn't have any
advantage over the race here just a
moralistic babies
but you can typically hear that it
sounds as if it was playing out of a box
or something so another trick
they shut off
I'm afraid you can always give some
distortion here everywhere great thing
about the releases clip it plays much
cleaner so up to maximum I'll stand up
go a bit far away and we'll listen to
them at maximum the relays won't play as
loud but it will remain perfectly clean
up to maximum so increasing volume now
with maximum the camisa you can get
slightly softer about much more control
sounds horrible
and I'll expect me
yes a river is definitely softer let's
try the Harman Kardon on the Camino I
start again with the Camino
yeah the taste also everything else
this penetrate County
first at lower levels onyx need as it
doesn't boost very well found thinner
but this comes to me and muscles I
definitely prefer the onyx meaning a
nameless end up again and see how they
perform at higher level we can hear
they're only also sounds nice
from a site while the camisa will
unusable and let increase volume to
maximum it's a conditional
is also bit distorted
you're just a boom MF although you could
hear that the Onyx me already compresses
quite a bit let's try maybe a dance
track
in this case I prefer their more
compressed formal jump in here it's more
compression but simply much better from
below it sounds like a broken radio or
something oh yeah you heard it listen to
it again in the speaker audio database
unfortunately there is some slight bassy
hum in the background so we had some
machines nearby but you can still
hopefully judge the sound of the economy
so it has nothing really great also
battery life is not exceptional I tested
a that maximum and it turned off after 2
hours 25 the Onyx mini being louder
place for 3 hours and 30 so quite a bit
longer the relays not being as loud
place for I think more than 4 hours for
us video I'm not sure so it's really
nothing I would recommend it's nice
design but you would expect definitely
much more out of it the sound is just
horrible only bass and the treble sounds
completely off so yeah nothing else to
say about the communal bamboo speaker 30
watts in module yeah it just doesn't
sound right therefore no no need or no
sense to lose any further words about it
I will turn it off so you can hear how
it turns off yeah like this and thanks
to everyone for watching I hope you
liked this and see you in the next video
have a nice time it bye bye
