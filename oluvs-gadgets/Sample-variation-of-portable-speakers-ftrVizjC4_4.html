you about sample variations portable
speakers or speakers in general if we
have the same speaker at home this does
not necessarily mean that all sound
exactly the same for example here I have
two JBL three four brand-new and when
heading a listen and comparing both
ahead the impression is if the grey one
had slightly less space so to get sure I
measure them and if you can see the grey
one has indeed less bass this is not a
big difference just one point two DB but
obviously it is enough to make this
difference here about to the human ear
maybe you remember some time ago I also
had a black JBL 3:3 unfortunately it had
some issues so and becoming hot there
Pasiphae toes who are sticking out and
it started to distort apart from that I
think that the black one sounded quite a
bit better I also measured both and you
can see that the difference is really
obvious so that black one had more bass
treble was completely different so when
listening to both side by side you
really have the impression if you are
listening to two different speakers I
also have a similar experience with
their than really before I had a light
unit
unfortunately suddenly the buttons broke
and it didn't work but I also think that
the white one found a slightly clearer
so one has slightly more treble but
apart from that they measure really
equal the same was with their bottom
twenty my first unit had some issues
with the battery so there was strong
self discharging after five days it
wouldn't turn on anymore
but I got a replacement and also noticed
some difference one has small bass the
other one has more treble or let's say
more treble extension why the treble is
slightly lower also the creative I will
go I got a unit and complained because
of to muffle sound so the replacement I
got I compared both again and you can
see the new one had less bass but more
treble and really extreme example is
their River trouble X I had a black and
then white unit and you can see although
the main part measures really equal
treble is completely off between both
one has a stronger boost patrols of
earlier the other one extends a bit
higher but doesn't has the strong
overall boost
still from all the turbo X units I've
heard so far they all sounded a bit
muscle to me maybe there are even better
samples around but I haven't heard them
yet but not on the JBL charts three you
can see I also have two of them here one
of them is a very early unit maybe
I was one of the very first to lead a
video about the charge free the other
one is a brand new recent unit and I
think they also sound quite a bit
different not sure about the reasons but
I thought we should have a listen as
always with me wearing value on
microphone you should of course listen
with headphones to hear the finest
details and then please tell me which
you think sounded better which has
better bass better treble forms and in
an upcoming video we will analyze the
small also with frequency response
measurements for both then I will also
tell you which one was there early unit
which one is the recent one and we can
discuss what's the reason for this if
it's just simple variation or if it's a
different version if JBL adjusted to
sound afterwards and so on
from what I heard someone discovered
that there are different versions of
their charts we if you take off the
cover you see that two or three are
completely different so we can of course
discuss this later on but now yeah
please put up your headphones and let's
check them out I would play some songs
and start with the left one which is
charge create this is charge 3b and the
first one will be analog from for
performances which are this should
reveal difference is already quite well
so please have a listen
damn it
Anita comic the sempia Alex yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah let me control this
which cutter the way that drove
impatient keep making bold
just let me improve your life if anyone
is going to a dish you wanna go on a
sketch show you maybe want to go a
little bit on you all can I do but it
was that simple I was like you but I
would not share you give two butts all
day decided oh but I gotta be careful
dinner
breakdown the awkwardness put on my
boots and a lily white dress million
words but how to express what I'm
feeling that you flash a smile I'm not a
kid this happening your way is that of
course drop everything you walk over and
ask if I'm all right hey hey
come on trick or a trick like this
now would be revolving with things
involving what you do in the bag you all
and not these pieces of the song at
least to be bounced back that I finally
you were thinking it Eliza local you
will see the community article Winslow
we are like the time from some women
images film with the partnership and
amount of wooden cane what it does when
it's awful nothing it islands all right
Rick what's going on with all the fish
maybe not a shaker is from different the
higher level both both buckling exactly
about volume now this increase volume to
report media
and it going
oh yeah now please tell me which one you
think is better which one has better
base which better travel and so on I
hope you like this thanks for watching
and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
