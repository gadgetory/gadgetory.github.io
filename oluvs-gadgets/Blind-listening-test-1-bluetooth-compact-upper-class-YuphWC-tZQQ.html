of us f surpassed the 20000 subscribers
called sometime ago this is of course
only possible because of you also
thanks again but this time to something
completely different I thought about
trying out something new a kind of blind
listening test this time I'm often
attacked and criticized by many that my
reviews and videos are biased that I'm a
JBL fanboy because I'd bash Ultimate
Ears
but to tell the truth I don't give a
 if this JBL written on it both sony
bits or whatever if the speaker simply
delivers and offers me the high audio
quality I'm after so far no speaker from
Ultimate Ears really managed this they
just released this overpriced average
sounding stuff and I don't like all this
hype created around them but here are
what I think may be the top speakers in
this class like the Bose Soundlink
immunity to the beats pill plus the JBL
charge 2 and the sony srs x-33
i know that these two are not the latest
models anymore there is already a JBL
charge 3 on the horizon and the sony
will have 2 successors like the XB 3
which is probably more optimized for
bass response and the hg 1 has also
Wi-Fi included and will be more probably
for high-definition audio but i thought
we will have a listen to these four
speakers without knowing which one is
playing i will cover them and simply
call them speaker a speaker beast
because see and speak addy so you really
don't know which one is playing but you
simply have to trust your ears to define
which one sounds best with which one
sounds worst we have this four speakers
here I will also play four different
songs I will be using my binaural
microphones and you should really listen
with headphones to get the most
realistic result we will check them out
so please have a listen now I will start
playing with speaker a please keep the
loudness of my voice as a rough
reference to get an idea how loud they
are actually playing the speakers are
set to around 3/4 of their maximum
volume so let's get started
you
you
so you say you know what I call the
mystery
unfortunately that's just the way it's
gonna be what it's not about now it's
all about yesterday it's all about so I
wish you're gonna wish you clarity wish
you joy
you
Oh
you
you
yeah
I hope you could get a rough idea about
the sonic differences of all these
speakers maybe speaker sounded great
with dance music but not so good with
rock while the other one could fare well
with acoustic material but simply sounds
like crap with jazz funk but still maybe
we can find an overall winner and the
big loser
and golden years may even try to guess
which speaker was a B C and D in two or
three weeks I will reveal the same video
again actually showing you which speaker
was playing in reality and if we managed
to find an overall winner we could try
to put this against the river s which I
will be giving away soon I think such a
blind test is as unbiased as possible
you have to trust your ears to find your
favorite I hope you liked it so far
maybe we can do more like this in the
future so please let me know and yeah we
will see us then have a nice time thanks
for watching and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
