with lots of great new portable speaker
releases like the hammock I'll go and
play dolly catch fifa Oslo Bengal
dachshund do play one and ultimate is
roll 2n but I would like to find the
very best one and after having spent
really lots of hours comparing listening
to lots of speakers I think that the
very best one is they FIFA Oslo
yeah we've heard the Harman Kardon go
and play against some others because
larger speakers like the aya XS 9 also
they do play a six and it felt really
well it sounded better than most of
these but I think the FIFA Oslo Saltz
even better yeah it's not a cheap
speaker yeah it's one of the most
expensive ones currently 500 euros or
$550 I think but it's louder than the
Harman Kardon play it has a much more
high fight tuning doesn't have this
extreme bass thump which is of course
nice for house and hip hop and so on but
for normal music listening that FIFA
Oslo definitely does a much better job
so the footprint you can see is much
smaller you can really put it into some
shelf or some small place why the Harman
Kardon being even one kilogram heavier
if it fits into a bag it will rather
occupy nearly the entire space while the
thief also is just about this big as a
larger dictionary so let's have a more
detailed look at it maybe you remember
some months ago I already presented the
ffs in case the best portable compact
bluetooth speaker the FIFA was like
everything that if I think is just
bigger better stronger yeah many
complained about the more feminine look
of the previous inky which looks like a
female handbag so v Oslo let's take it
as a male version yeah just like the
FIFA I think it has two different
tunings neutral which measures pretty
flat and late night which gives you a
little bit of a bass and treble boost
compared against a go and play you can
see that this one has a more bass boost
but at the same time there is some
inconsistency with treble with lots of
hills and dips so overall the Fedora is
definitely the more musical and natural
frequency response regardless if played
at neutral or late night
it should also appeal more to real audio
files and music lovers and I thought I
will demonstrate you the difference in
sound again we already heard it against
the hammer : go and play but I thought
we'll do this again as the first unit
ahead was not quite representative
back buffer had some problem and
produced some fatty noise this is my own
unit that I bought which is perfect and
place clean even at maximum and as
always I will be using a head cam and
binaural microphones and usually listen
with headphones you will get much better
results when listening for crappy
headphones then when listening for real
studio monitors therefore please put up
your headphones and let's check them out
if you fall is set to late night mode in
order to make them more comparable and
first I will play some more jazzy stuff
as I don't think that real audiophile -
lovers really would like me to play
Eminem or Skrillex but later on will
also play some more electronica music
also crank them to maximum to see which
one is louder I will start with a few
false offers so please have a listen
in our track
as you can see volume is set for about
half football
you
something else or another trick
Oh
you my love I'm do most anything you
sweet baby I'll do most anything Thunder
and I hope you feel the same way myself
he gave me milk yeah maybe you can hear
that the hammer Colin can play sounds a
little bit more diffuse then he falls la
has much more clarity the bass doesn't
have this extreme thump but we will
notice with the next track that the bass
is much more even so all bass notes are
more less with the same loudness while
with the Harman Kardon go and play you
will hear that some particular notes are
louder so let's have a listen again P
Fausto first
you can hear it some notes are pushed
much more forward
default again
maybe some other trick
you
yeah yeah the stronger based thump of
the hammer : gunplay was also quite
noticeable let's try now track
it's for something else and with not
house music without this space hump the
hammer Cardinal not sounding a bit
strange maybe I will pay german volk a
bit lower and you will notice that the
fee files law still sounds pretty nicely
full-bodied while the Harman Kardon
currently doesn't really shine that much
at low level
so for rather low-level listening the
chief also definitely is the better
choice this starts to solidly bikini
even a pure play a one sounds more more
full-bodied and they're going play at
these levels let's increase volume again
I will try to match them more less
and maybe some kind of rock back
it's time to increase volume lower
their complaint
yeah and I will place them more towards
the wall or what's the TV set here and
it's time to switch their fifa Oslo to
neutral mode in order to avoid
distortion at higher levels I will turn
v Oslo to neutral mode node and crank
them both to maximum I will start again
with the fee for slot and the same track
so increasing volume to maximum
and pick one place well
quickly
another trick
quickly
you
this really acquired on her hooker
most definitely
you
okay this stops getting ready
pemmican much too strong yeah
dance track
both shall not distort but the people
specifically louder
yeah I think you could hear it the v4
slope being smaller and lighter than the
go and play picked similar punch was
even louder with no dynamic compression
no Distortion
so is it the perfect portable speaker
well there is still lots of room for
improvement
for example battery life is not that
great but it's not great on both both
will die after around 2 hours at maximum
at moderate levels I got around 10 hours
which is still ok but there is hardly
any stereo separation also there are no
tweeters so treble dispersion is a
little bit directional but it's still
one of the greatest because I've heard
you really get the sound that was
recorded with no edit effects or fake
boost or something I really love it also
because it's so small it's way smaller
and more compact than the Harman Kardon
complain more in a class of a JBL
extreme but simply sounding much much
better yeah of course quality has its
price it's not a cheap speaker but maybe
you can find some discount ones and if
you find it reduced yeah grab it it's
definitely worth it I really love it and
it's my favorite speaker I can only talk
of myself for me it's the best speaker
2016 but let's see what 2017 will bring
until then yeah
stay tuned have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
