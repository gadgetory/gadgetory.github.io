to make a short video about the hi-fi
man re-400 i i stands for iOS ipod or
whatever comes with an own remote
control there are different versions for
android or without remote and this one
is already a litte bit older maybe four
five years old something like that
and this is another one which was
recommended to me by John Young after
the Samsung is 8 the sony image 1 the
moon drop area this was included as well
and when looking at inner fidelity their
Wall of Fame it's included there as well
directly below the automatic er4 so yeah
I was quite interested to hear it back
then I think it cost $100 in the
meantime you can get it below 50 I saw
some reviews many are complaining
because of that build quality or
something the remote falls apart and so
on yeah it's a little bit it feels a
little bit cheap but the sound should be
great according to John and also inner
fidelity and many others before having
listened also later on having look at
some measurements let's have a look
inside it's a bit strange very small as
you can see and much Rufus is a dynamic
driver I suppose and the tips which were
mounted are really small not sure what I
can do with these yeah I can put it in
my nose maybe but they won't fit in into
a normal ear maybe for you for a child
or something but there are other tips as
well and this is quite interesting
because the tips have a huge influence
on sound so if you look at how different
all these are look at this one the
double flange also extends the in the a
noodle or whatever much farther so if
you put this inside yeah this will be
further outside compared to a small one
like that
there are also normal ones formed a
symmetrically so there are cut off like
this very strange also one like that a
bit longer some some no paper tour
whatever I tried all of them I tried
different tips from the sony image 1 but
I couldn't get any decent sound out of
it
it's tuned quite neutral so but still
there is something off to my ears it
doesn't sound very that great therefore
maybe before talking about sound let's
have a listen first and I thought we'll
compare it against the
demotic nk5 which I like a lot also very
flat tuning you'll see later with the
measurements they made a similarly flat
but the automatic still sound way nicer
way more natural there is something
wrong I'm not sure what it is but maybe
we can discuss this later
so first the - re-400
and then I will switch over to the
automatic and a different you will hear
the original track so
so I think you'd hear it's far off from
the e-team optic you can get for $70 so
not that much more expensive but of
course here you have again the problem
with this deep insertion which you might
like or not but I think this also would
profit from a deep insertion but
unfortunately there are no suitable feet
tips which could allow this so you would
need a special tip which could make it
stay inside I noticed that the sound
becomes a little bit fuller and also
nice and not as picky as with normal
tips when I press it deep inside so I
would have to keep it like that but you
could hear there was some strange
harshness very flat response bass hardly
hardly any bass not with this ears here
when I press them deep inside there is
some stronger base but still not really
that impressive and especially because
the rest is not that great this
transition from meats to tribal there is
something wrong therefore I don't quite
like them John says they are great maybe
it's just that my ears are not
compatible but when looking at some
response measurements here for both
channels channel matching is a little
bit not that great so I will Everage
both and you can see there is this
strange hump here at 5 kilohertz let's
say yet first is a deep below at 380
loads then again this hump but when I
overlay the a thematic you can see bass
is even slightly less although it
appeared definitely fuller from the
recording and meets up epi also boost it
I'm not sure if the compensation curve
for the fuse field is real correct here
because usually it should be flattered
it should be more a flat line and it has
some well not peak but there is some
slack slight hump at 4 kilohertz but it
doesn't have this deep at 3 kilohertz of
the high fivin then again there is some
treble raise at around 12 13 kilo Hertz
for the high fivin which the automatic
doesn't have but overall you could hear
the animatics on it way way better so
it's not my thing maybe
they just don't fit me well really when
I press them deeper inside I could get
something like a half-decent sound but
still I mean compared to these Samsung
is eight they have completely different
more bass also more smelly response
while these want to be neutral but
somehow they fail why the team optics
really sound mutual sound like a pair of
studio monitors here is something wrong
maybe my ears maybe these ears maybe
both but you could hear from the
recording it just doesn't sound good so
when I compared the recording back and
forth with the original keep in mind
this is just a rough sketch it's not
100% representative but it was close the
characteristics was captured well so I
get this train I don't know so for me
it's not that great although others
maybe might like it but it it could be a
problem with my ears so this was my take
on the - hurry 400 hmm not sure yet
tried out but I was a little bit
underwhelmed truth I definitely prefer a
more fun tuning made from the same song
from the Sony image one which sounds
more normal to me but this one is a bit
of the automatic at the the first time
you put it on you have to you really you
have to care to really get a great seal
you will hear this if the scene is not
great it doesn't isolate that much so
you will still hear your voice more
everything around you may be on one side
more so yeah check that they are really
at both sides please the same depth and
the very first time you met they may
appear maybe strange sounding but then
after some minutes you get used to the
sound also probably because of the
pressure in your ear which gets them
afterwards comes out and then they sound
outstanding really stunning why these
here No so for $70 or what the mk5 no of
course they are really great although I
definitely prefer the ER 3x are over
them still again more refinement more
more soundstage more whatever but for
what they are
mk5 is really great yeah thanks all for
watching nothing else to say and see you
the next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
