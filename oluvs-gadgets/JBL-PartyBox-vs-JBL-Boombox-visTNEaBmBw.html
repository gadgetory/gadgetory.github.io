will compare the brain on JBL party box
against the JBL boombox I'm pretty sure
many will complain this is not quite
fair look at the size difference I think
it is because both are from JBL and the
body box is even cheaper this is the
model 300 which has a built in battery I
paid four hundred forty nine euros on
the JBL online store while the gvl
boombox is listed with one at ninety
nine them in the meantime you can find
it with lower prices from other dealers
but I'm pretty sure that after some time
also the prices for the JBL Perry box
will drop there is even a cheaper model
called two hundred which doesn't have
any battery built in but it costs only
249 so cheaper than a TV listening to or
half the price of the GPL boombox so for
all those who are looking for something
loud powerful with great bass and don't
care that much about size
this might do the trick therefore I came
out this year so we can immediately hear
which one is louder which one has more
bass which one is more powerful and so
on it's always I'll be using my head
camp or some webinar on microphones you
should of course the Smith headphones
binaural recordings require headphones
for the best results put them up and
let's have a listen let's start with a
classic disco track and the GBL party
box playing first with volume around
half
boombox
switching back to the pallet box takes a
bit of time you can hear that it sounds
way more powerful with bass but also it
gives a little more muddy comparison
boombox which has lots of troubles but
the boombox
from fighting against it and it also has
a bass boost mode or something but I
think yeah this is not that great and he
only boosts up a bass cut off this nice
lower base so I'm not sure maybe they
screwed up somehow maybe there will be
some update but like this it sounds
horrible
maybe from some distance it's very
booming now I was would you switch it
off again here much more lower base very
nice kick the boom box can only travel
somehow it also time switching on auto
mode here although I definitely prefer I
definitely prefer indoor because of this
nice lower base comparable anymore
so let's increase the maybe two Maxima
mr. haibach
yeah becomes a tweeter
actually it's not dead loads I thought
it would be no there so I don't think it
can compete with the sound box or even
their big phony the traffic is only some
slight distortion but when you can also
hear all three notes even the lowest one
which is our forty hurt let's see the
box placement as well no only two notes
the lowest note is missing here and only
Trevor that's why this track here nicely
controlled no distortion is still nice
basement the person reduce base at all
just some slight limiting these levels
it's sounding a little bit boring but it
does not reduce phase
homeworks hey comes a toy I will try
switching it to endure again because of
this nice surveys is from my place I
could also switch it to the airport
until it connects and so on so this is
the boom box maximum near base is nicer
notice posted but simply more lower base
control looks like this
Paw Paw Paw Paw we are like the bit so
controls it does not reduce base it does
not bother something just a slight
distortion maybe with very heavy tracks
at this phase
boombox yeah where is the bully Menapace
is really nice here maybe a little bit
flabby bother in for a party this is
really nice I will try this bass boost
mode again not sure maybe you like it
more but for me to just woman and let's
increase volume again I think it makes
it becomes better at normal levels it's
unbearable there's no bass at all just
just Trevor
but still I think I there is too much
upper base if they just boosted the area
around 70 Hertz but there is lots of
boost up to 200 250 so let's listen
again without I think it sounds much
nice like this
yeah pity this bass boost mode we have
failed a little bit maximum
it's quite impressive although I would
have expected more loudness great
nor is it real you know it's quite
expensive but I think it's when you're
balanced with this I think you cannot
see this effect well but nice way nice
effects and it's honest
boombox it tries to compete loudness
wise at least for motivation oh I don't
like that worth as much here to also
bear activity seems a bit strange come
on this is a great sound
I will go far away I may be 20 meters
now begin a small deadlock so the
sandbox cool here I was really
struggling to come closer because it was
so loud boom box well
[Laughter]
fathers lies the difference is not the
huge task that the boombox
loses all ways and just pushes me sinto
on the mirror activity is a bit strange
so there is some space sitting here you
can hear how this time changes a bit
despite Twitter's let's write this track
the base is really impressive boombox a
people the size is quite ok but still
not close to a diamond box or talking
about the symbols no nothing impressive
and way too expensive for what it offers
no Portnoy just some slides there
crackling but very little Tom this
becomes really ridiculous a boy tries to
keep some lower base Mooji Heather the
entire edge is just missing only
trailing lower base yeah I mean it's
really not compare this
okay
you can hear it loses quite quickly the
creatures seem to be too far inside or
something
boombox
yeah way too much people here
I don't like fairy here let's reduce
running again so the boombox sounds best
up to where personally
all these people is
well
yeah I still have one song from
nocopyrightsounds from Jim Yusuf let's
try this
and again increasing volume to maximum
Oh cake making yeah but this is the
trail here
so I think overall the body box does a
much better job especially being less
expensive so please tell me your opinion
I would say the JBL padded box place in
a completely different league over the
JBL boom box completely blows it away
while being even cheaper but here not to
forget the size and weight difference I
think it's about three times the weight
of the JBL boom box so more compared to
the sound box already but it seems to
like loudness when I was exactly one
year ago in summer with the Sun box tool
for trying it out the very first time I
turned it to maximum and I was blown
away
yeah was way more impressed by the
loudness by the power so here that party
box doesn't seem to be able to compete
the sound is great up to maximum nicely
controlled very little distortion only
with heaviest tracks but yeah it's not
as powerful I think even the Sony
expediting should be louder it was
nearly as loud as the sound box too but
not as great sounding so the party box
sounds really nice although I don't like
this bass boost button here it cuts off
the nice lower base and boosts up a bass
around hundred 200 Hertz it becomes
somehow booming more compared to the
Sony maybe but without it sounds nicely
balanced still has some nice kick to it
although at low levels it might sound
even boring outdoors so I'm not quite
sure it can compete with the song box
tool has way more features also nice
lightning but the sound box tool
regarding power is maybe twice as loud
the only thing I could offer you next is
a comparison to the total rock star air
this is the only one I currently have at
home which is really not but I thought
this will be able to compete maybe sound
wise yes because it seems to be tuned
quite nicely so it appears quite
balanced I also did some measurements I
will show you in my full review but I
think the trifle rocks that I am of
those smaller is still somehow louder
but we can maybe check this out in an
upcoming video so I hope you liked this
first comparison against the JBL boom
box of course also a full review will be
coming stay tuned until then have a nice
time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
