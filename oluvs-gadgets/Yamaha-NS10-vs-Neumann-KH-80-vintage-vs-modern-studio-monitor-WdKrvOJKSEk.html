built something up I produced some mess
yesterday we'll be listening to to
difference to the monitors I think that
one the famous Yamaha Venice tape from
the Senate is quite a recent one from
this year that varmint KH 80 we already
got this before but I thought it might
be interesting how such an old monitor
compress against a very modern Newell
the Yamaha in a stem was resetting 1978
and paid them it became something like a
studio standard you can still find it in
today's studios I'm not sure why because
it sounds really crappy I had to used it
I just bought it from a friend many
years ago who wanted to sell all his
studio stuff so they wouldn't do it but
yeah you couldn't judge or it is I
couldn't judge any Nick's on them the
ones on the other hand they have
included with some room correction
possibilities it's not available yet but
it should be in summer and yeah
let's read listen to them I selected
some tracks and instead of using a
binaural artificial head I will use my
own ears again because I'm not satisfied
it is the styrofoam which keeps a little
hollowness of I don't know but first let
me try it if I matched volumes welcome
Genghis my detergent so these are the
moments we are wrong
6465
great so it should be oh yeah I will
take my microphones sit down on the sofa
and let's race
I think this comparison was quite funny
I hope you found this interesting as
well I think you can claim that for the
base then that based on really bad
especially meat a way to overemphasize
quite noticeable with the last rock
trick so you can inherit but still many
students seem to use it even today maybe
to cross-check their mixes I'm not sure
maybe in the 70s this was regarded some
standards all high five systems at home
something like this or even worse but
for today I wouldn't use them but there
are lots of things maybe because of
Master G I'm not sure yeah I will give
them away to a friend of mine tell me if
I should include the me to my database
I'm not sure if it makes any sense okay
h EG i already included as well as the
audio pro h LT 8 l yeah of course I
would every other speaker which is worth
me I'm not sure about the Yamahas maybe
yes simply to get some idea about the
sound I would do this but of course it's
a concern so if you want to support me
if you like the database every donation
is welcome this helps me to we have to
feed it with new speakers and so on and
so on
I also work on my normal head a little
bit further
I ordered a used model and old vintage
one from Sennheiser so at least if the
microphones up ahead I can still use the
head but this styrofoam of year yeah I
think the acoustics is not suitable for
Benoit heads there's too much too much
mmm acoustic transmitted through the
head so yes I hope I can improve here as
well still any donations really welcome
you helped me a lot with this and coming
up next is me really comparing the
Norman k80 against their audio Pro there
someone is more horrified as one small
plant responds for studio it could be
interesting to hear them as well of
course both included so you can hear
them from my database but doing it live
it it might be still more interesting I
hope you liked this video I know that
someone asked about the Yama in a Stan
here to include them as well so I did
and now I can send them to my friend
thanks all for watching and see you then
