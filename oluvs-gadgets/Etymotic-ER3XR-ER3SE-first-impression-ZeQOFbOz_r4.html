to talk a little bit about the a
thematic er3 series which comes in two
different versions SS II which stands
for studio edition or XR which stands
for extended response but let's rather
simply call it more base because apart
from more base was for the X version
they sound more is the same but please
don't treat this as a kind of home
review I just want to give you my
personal impressions about this - my
experience with them also I want to
describe the sound as good as possible
the differences in sound this time I
cannot offer you any sound samples no
measurements I did my best I tried to
record and measure them with this system
here but I failed remember a thematic in
ears need a very deep seal so when I put
it in here I already touched the
microphone that you can L is much
shorter here than from a normal human
ear the ear geometry is completely
different therefore I was measuring and
recording just some maybe
remember I reviewed the automatic MK 5
already before I already do some sound
samples but post will really just rough
approximations so I didn't want to do
this with the ER 3 they sound really
great so it's definitely a step up over
the mk5
I got the Excel versions from messed up
$150 so it's twice the price so is it
worth twice the price over the mk5 I
would say definitely because what I was
missing here the Strebel definition is
some some sparkle also some bass you
definitely get from the ER three but one
problem I have with all of them is how
the sound changes depending on the tips
all of them come with three different
type of tips so with three flange small
one a big one and foamies with home is
this on like crap so you lose treble
definition also bass is not that great
when I tried the ER 3x aha for the very
first time I tried them on the small
tips but it's very hard for me to really
get this deep seal I have to put them
far inside they hurt so yeah you are
probably for a raping I get a better
seal maybe with the bigger ones but the
sound changes again so with the big ones
I lose treble I lose trailer definition
but bass gets enhanced so that is
immersion which at scale has quite a
flat base so not boosted with the
big tips and Lee sounds still not
boosted but sounds really nicely defined
with bass why the acceleration with the
big tips
sounds too booming together with the
reduced treble it's a little bit yea
muddy
therefore hmm I like the Excel version
with the small tips still I have some
problems to fit there are some tutorial
videos how to put them in so you have to
hold your ear pull it up then I don't
know I have my own way so I have to find
the curves from my channel and and go
around them so when I get a good fit a
good seal with the small tips the sound
is outstanding from both the only
difference is that the XR has slightly
more bass and as these tips probably
reduce bass slightly I don't like the
easy version that much with the big tips
there is he has perfect bass but again
and losing travel there is another trick
that was suggested to me by John thanks
John
again for all those recommendations you
did to cut the big tips just cut away
the lowest biggest flange so you have a
kind of B flange tip is the same here
just you can see the bottom part is cut
away and suddenly the mk5
gets closer to the ER 3 responds not as
mid focused anymore base becomes
pronounced and travel still ok it it
makes this pattern so I tend to put up
16 kilohertz slightly I think that I
have hardly any response above 16 17 so
for all those who hear still until 22
kilohertz probably they won't like the
automatic but what I love about them is
that they sound so so true so how do
they call this pretty precise or
accurate they have a very accurate
response so no Peaks no strange boosts
treble everything sounds right yeah but
again I have the problem that the sound
changes so much the pennilyn tips the
sound the change is not huge it's not
but the balance changes so when I switch
the small tips to the big ones bass gets
more treble gets reduced you could maybe
counter work with some adapter there are
some some resistance adapters which
again push treble but it was still not
enough so I tried the SE version with
the big tips or with the B flange which
are way easier to put inside because
they seal quite well don't need such a
deep deep seal but even with the adapter
I was missing treble while with these
small ones yeah they hurt maybe I get
used to them but the sound is really
outstanding very very studio like very
very I don't know very true very very
direct you really have the impression as
if you had it if it's a very heavy as if
you had the music inside your head as if
you were inside the music no strange
Peaks no colorations and this is what I
like about them the only problem I have
is yeah this is this strange seal and
tip fit the firmness didn't help the
sound becomes just it's really very very
dual I read some who claim that they get
a great sound I wonder how I mean
everyone has different ears therefore
maybe you get completely different
results depending on the pips but what I
noticed is that the sound definitely
changes between the small and the big
ones and of course between to the phone
is the mk5
with this be flange trick so cutting off
the lowest flange already improve a lot
for me because bass gets the perfect
amount also the strange neat honky Ness
gets lost why probably still ok but the
TR 3x our the small tip still give you
an additional step above but yeah you
need a good seal a good fit so I'm not
sure maybe if you get a good one with
this you will probably not get the same
sound and getting therefore also not
that easy to really record them because
this again reacts completely different
than a human here sometimes it's enough
that I put them inside
one half a millimeter valance said and
the sound already changes sometimes the
treble subtly then lower treble it
becomes emphasized so I pull my ear
slightly and then it becomes okay again
so this is really a tricky part I can
only state that when you get the perfect
treat the sound is perfect with both the
AC and the X hours and just that they AC
with these tips for my taste is a little
bit proof let with bass so I prefer the
X hours apart from that there is not
much difference travel is nice maybe the
extension is not there so you don't hear
there the uppermost frequencies above 20
kilohertz but from alias it's just
perfect because it's not colored in any
way
unlike most all the others I reviewed a
fine but they are coloured to some
degree those are not so you get reader
response that you would get from a
speaker standing outside in front of you
which is which really really nice
well there is also the ER for which is
small s the same just met a
quality-control better match drivers
probably this used to I think to
balanced amateur or is it just one I'm
not sure I think to balance amateur this
one has just one enemy to Anna so still
quite impressive but again here you need
to experiment a little bit with the tips
the form is yeah for me I yes I won't
use them at all then but you can try the
big ones the small ones and get put them
as deep inside as you really get
everything blocked out these are also
called isolator because when you really
have the perfect seal the perfect I saw
that everything around you you'll hear
have anything they are much better than
those nose and noise canceling
headphones from Sony or Bose so all the
hype around all this noise cancelling is
just because those sound great
and isolate anything away so much better
than those active NC headphones so back
to the automatic er 3 deathly nice not
sure if the extra for the ER for which
is smallish the same just
better quality control but sound
response should be the same it's again
twice the price so I bought them for
mass drop for 150
I think the ER for is over 300 350
hearing in Europe it's I think close to
400 euros so I'm quite satisfied with
this enough you can also exchange cables
they have the standard mm CX connector
promise you cannot use a standardized
cable because this is more recessed so
you would need a cable like this which
has them in the connector more exposed I
try to exchange the cable for another
one but I didn't manage and there's only
one position where they snap in if the
cable gets damaged we can of course
exchange it but you would need the same
for me read some fake replacements also
comes with this this clip so that you
don't get any any wire micro phonics
noise they also have this let me see you
can it's written that you can pull the
add this here so you can pull this up
and stiff it to your to your like this
and there shouldn't be any cable noise
but from that it also comes with some
filter removal tool also with two
additional filters which are here I
didn't do now but when they get thanks
to a wax when they become the rear or
blocked somehow you can remove them and
put in some some other ones from what I
heard without filters they are very
harsh so yet they do it quite an
outstanding job to tune them to such a
way that they offer I Otis this
realistic accurate sound so yeah if I
once managed to get real coolers I see
something norm Duan I will try to record
them maybe I will definitely keep the X
hours also the mk5
I like them but the VR 3 X is definitely
still one step above just more a hint I
would say and quite impressive what you
can get for $150 yeah I heard in years
costing more than thousands crap but
really crap so this is really upsetting
if you are after a very true lifelike
sound the automatic you have to try out
if the XR doesn't have too much bass but
it depends a lot on the tips here so
this was my quick overview over both I
like them both but I personally I prefer
slightly more bass especially because I
seem to lose bass with these small tips
here I had the big ones boost bass
especially if you cut them away maybe
the fit is not as deep I'm not quite
sure what was the reason for this why
it's so dependent because a pad from the
size there is not much difference
between these tips you see just a
diamond guy a diameter I still don't
know how to pronounce in diameter but
the sound chain is really a lot I think
it just depends on how deep they are
inside so with those probably not as
deep as with the small ones the small
ones get deeper inside closer to the ear
drum also heard more as you get or at
least I get a much clearer sound much
nicer sound with less bass but therefore
I like the exertion more yeah I think
this was it nothing else to say really
my personal reference currently for as
accurate sound as possible but quite
uncomfortable to carry because of this
deep seal deep feet after first try on I
had to recover my ears for some days
because yeah I was I had them inside but
I could feel that the seal is still not
there so I took them out so I damaged my
ear
so also when wearing them can maybe wear
them for 1-2 hours and then they become
uncomfortable because you feel some
pressure there are other tips maybe I
could order some some second party ones
just to try out maybe some soft
once I noticed that then it's the it's
easier to fit them when you pull the tip
out slightly then you insert them and
then when they are inside the ear you
just press them deeper then it's easier
to for me at least also the sound
changes depending on how far usually you
should put them to the very end but also
quite funny is that there are tips this
here have a longer stem and not sure if
you can see this with in the video while
this these here have a shorter one so
you can change the tuning also depending
on this stem length these are quite a
bit longer about one millimeter maybe
two millimeters longer than this and I
prefer definitely those with the longest
time this give better treble somehow so
again my camera will stop in some
minutes so thanks for watching I hope
you liked it anyhow so for this
improvisation but I just wanted to show
you this I think they are really worth
it but you need to experiment with tips
and feet and everything yeah so in the
next video bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
