hi guys viens it gets right there
inventory boom stay excited for clicking
some Ava excess nine bars all feel a
mugging the dodging videos protest in
Majesty's man of English a bird iso visa
five again no for how the music to spin
on if it's a cotton candy reclined home
so now in english as so many always
complaining about the german videos but
the funny thing is that the toy free
boomstick cell is only available in
germany so probably nobody from america
australia will ever buy one except if he
wants to add high shipping costs and
texas and so on on the other hand the
either excess nine is only available in
america so far so no european will
probably buy one but I think it's anyhow
an interesting comparison as these two
seem to be some kind of flagships of
portable ghetto blasters boom blasters
this time I would like to concentrate on
sound indoors we've already heard the
loudness difference in my loudness
comparison my German video where so many
were complaining about this time we are
more interested in the overall sound and
as you can see I place them far away as
they are much more able to fill the
whole room compared to well small
speakers that you will listen from one
meter I would like to play some
different genres and I would like to
avoid any talking this time just play
some music so that you can concentrate
on sound the tone controls are off for
both so the IVA has a five minute
equaliser which is turned off the total
boomstick cell has bass and treble
control which is also turned off I will
start with a classical track from
Tchaikovsky and we will have a listen as
always I'm wearing binaural microphones
so for best results you should wear
headphones let's have a listen
you
have I for you to give you dirty looks I
have words that do not come from
children's books I'm learning
- I've got the long stick I'll borrow
anesthesia
and the perfect risk to give you make a
twist hammer lock holds I've mastered a
few but everything I've got belong to
you chef oh
struck each that I drop you for me I'll
give you plenty of nothing I'm not yours
for better and I've learned to give the
well-known witch
Oh summer days I'm with you
quiet thoughts not much to say and not a
lot to do
time to take a trip around the world
guest shadows from the Stone
baby
you
you
so yeah I hope you liked it you liked my
choice of music well I tried including
different styles and genres
I didn't comment on the sound yeah they
sound different that's sure but I think
it's also a matter of taste you can
tweak both for either more treble more
bass less space less treble whatever so
yeah the title boom star is a great
device but it's also twice the price of
the IVA so if you like the sound of the
Ivor I think you cannot get anything
well much better for below $300 thanks
for watching and yeah I will be sending
the toy for booms the XL back this is
still a prototype this is not a final
version maybe I will get the final
version as well when they become
available
I think they are still a bit limited so
yes we will see us in the next video
until then have a nice time and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
