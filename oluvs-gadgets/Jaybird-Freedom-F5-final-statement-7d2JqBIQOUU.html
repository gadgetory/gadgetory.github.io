to my job at freedom video from last
time as I think the sound samples could
have been a little bit misleading I
don't think they represent the real
qualities of this headphone that well I
think it sounds amazing but from the
recording it appeared a rather poor also
been reading some comments with people
claiming it sounds way off not even
close to the original source the x3
sounded way better I also think that
from the recording the extra sound is
better and there are many reasons for
this
keep in mind recording in ears or
headphones in general is not an easy
task so it's not putting them in
pressing record and it already sounds
like in reality so I always try to bring
it as close as possible with using some
Sennheiser HD 600's reference so when
listening through this it should sound
more or less the same but there are
other factors which keeps I'm using so
how far I put them inside and so on what
are maybe on the mode of this microphone
I tried to record them again with
exactly the same tips exactly the same
equalizer settings and it sounds
different than last time
not sure why maybe because they inserted
a little bit deeper or whatever I'm not
quite sure so this is a kind of life
recording I really want to come here I
really wanted to make it as life as
possible I will play some samples the
same track like last time analog from
savasana and first you will hear the
recording from last time and then from
this time and I would start switching
between different equalizer settings
because the one I used for the freedom
was different than the one I used for
the x3 for the freedom I used an
equalising which was based on URIs setup
he tried to bring it as close to the
Hammond target as possible I personally
I rather made it by ear so I wanted to
bring it as close as possible to my Etta
Mata core to the HT 600 to have another
flat response and then I felt URI is
maybe closer because it's closer to the
Harmon target but who knows how close
the Harmon target release and I mean
there are so many factors I'm recording
it and equalizing it also the the HT 6
heart is already equalized with this
sana works profile so there are so many
factors it will never sound exactly the
same as if you are listening to it by
yourself so I will play analogue from
last time then I will switch over to
to the new recording to the life
recording so let's start so this is the
recording which is live now you can hear
there's already a difference the
previous one feels slightly more
metallic I'm not sure why so this one is
exact the same EQ that was used before
which is claiming a junkie URI you can
find this for download if you have the
freedom or some other day but but here I
have so this would be the flat I will
switch always m249 and Uli's EQ and when
I listen to the headphone compared to
the HTC sonnet it really appears somehow
Hongki so I created a new one which
sounds like this I also have one like
that
for some older ones
you can hear you can influence the sound
a lot depending on the EQ I will try to
amelie stick it deeper inside it's not
easy because after some time it gets out
again so let it adjust and the sound
already changed again this is the one
from last time and when I listen to this
comparing it to here I have the same
track and when I compare it to the sound
I'm getting from the HD v 8x
maybe with this equalizing itself
etcetera
I mean they are closed still so let's
stop this it's really not easy and
therefore I simply want to stop all this
because my samples can be misleading if
I put in an India which sounds way off
it will also sound way off but this one
sounds great on its own also according
to the measurements we are quite closer
to have a target a but obviously at some
if an Indian or place at the particular
level the the the errors of this
recording system starts to total yet to
become obvious so my equalizing probably
cannot capture it that well I just
wanted to tell you this because I'm not
satisfied
I never was but most in years I've
tested were so crappy that it didn't I
mean it didn't matter if there was some
frequency slightly off it was off anyhow
but this one sounds really great and it
simply doesn't do that in justice I read
some criticism yeah the ratings on
Amazon are bad it's quality I mean this
is a special edition which costs $50 I
mean for $50 I would buy three or four
of them and they should work for the
next three four years and you will get
better sound then then of any of the of
the other more expensive Sennheiser true
Wireless momentum or whatever their
fighters wanted to tell you this I am
not satisfied with this recording
technique it was nice to capture the
really crappy sounding ones because you
could immediately hear their crappy
sounding but if an India gets at some
particular point level the errors of
this recording system of the resonances
here which are not similar are different
than those from in human ear the human
ear has a length of 2 point 5 centimeter
small s so if you close it you get the
pipe with the resonance at 3 6 12 but
this is way shorter so it simply reacts
differently and the resonance is
depending on how deep I insert them
change so yeah that's what it because
I'm quite amazed with this I really I
hardly use any other one the only thing
yeah for sports it's I mean it's
marketed as a sports in here I wouldn't
use it for sports
I drove my my electric scooter with it
and due to the occlusion effect you get
some some air volume which which also
gets some resonance yeah here only some
rumbling the rumbling from the from the
tires from my body or whatever so I
cannot listen to music with them with
hardly any it's possible so I would need
over ears or the animatic it works well
because they are so far inside that you
are already inside the bone after the
second band or whatever and you don't
get this this self resonance so I tried
I couldn't hear so when you have some
activity no running
I can hear every step although I'm using
foamies promise you really should
correct this but these are a little bit
harder I mean not that not that soft so
maybe they don't absorb it that well so
again it's conclusion to this whole
India topic I just I'm not able I had
some discussion with another great
youtuber his name is Chris from a
channel called spring loft studio he
recorded some over ear headphones we had
some he also recorded or accosted with
the mini DSP we had some we had some
files I recorded the HD 58 X Jubilee he
also has it he recorded it and our
recordings differed not only the raw
recording the unequal ice-t-- was
already different so i mean come on
then he sent me his recording how he
hears the HTC 58 X Jubilee
I sent him mine I personally think mine
is closer to reality than his he thinks
his is closer so it could also be that
he is hearing the headphone differently
I was of course not aware of this but it
could be that you hear the HD feel capex
completely
differently there were some papers from
some great German research doctors some
don't remember the name he had some in a
probe and he measured for I don't know
10 15 individuals and they measured the
response of the HD 600 inside the ear
and only two of them had the response
close to how the HD 600-foot sound all
the others heard something completely
different of course they had not aware
that they hear it differently I'm also
anyway for me the HD 600 sounds like the
H is excited because I I couldn't even
imagine it to sound different but I
think there is way more research to be
done and I'm not a researcher I'm just a
little youtuber who's trying to offer
you something valuable
therefore I'm stopping with this because
it's too much too much energy of my
energy which in the end isn't
acknowledged any harm therefore yeah and
just talking about sound doesn't make
sense all the others do it as well and I
could claim something I could claim yeah
this is the worst sounding it's so
crappy because it has no base or
whatever I don't want to do this talking
about sound is way harder than hearing
it by yourself but I really it's maybe
it's possible but I don't manage to
offer you really a valid representative
sound and I noticed it now with the with
the freedom because I think it sounds
really amazing I like it I prefer it
over any other in here and then I read
read some comments yeah it sounds way
off it sounds not even close to the
original sauce so therefore this whole
topic should be closed somehow also you
probably hear it again differently than
me depending on the tips depending on
your ear shape from on earth my my how
are the doctors called the otologist I
don't know he said I have quite a narrow
in ear canal I also notice it because it
really hurt when I tried the a thematic
the first time others with a broader one
may be completely different frequency
responses so still my opinion is that if
the frequency the general response is
move without any Peaks it could be
already or it should already sound okay
then with some equalizing if it's not
equalized well you can bring it to a
high level like with this here there are
no peaks with the form is unlike with
the original tips there is none of this
six seven kilowatts Peaks like many
others have all those chafed I have some
zigzag response which is impossible to
equalize this is not it's treble heavy
or it's partly no it's not it's just
some zigzag frequency response so the
basics for a good sound should be a
smooth response and then there are
factors that influence the sound your
ear my ear the shape of your ear canal
the tips you are using how deep you
insert it and so on and so on so it's
simply too much and I don't want to deal
with all the same board therefore
because I think it's really an amazing
headphone the free that special edition
cost fifty dollars so I mean I wouldn't
even care I just pay thousand dollars
for some crappy sounding in ears and
they are satisfied crappy because they
don't have the smooth response so the
basics is already off so I cannot
imagine their ears to be that off that
it sounds ok for them yeah so I think I
said everything what is to say for me
the xx3 sounded worse I mean you can
bring them to the same level with maybe
with the same tips but the x3 with such
normal form is lost rebel while this one
doesn't you can put the for me way way
more to the back which is not possible
due to the due to design of the x3 for
the extreme I would have to cut it here
one third away and then it would be
similar maybe so I'm using that in audio
t2 tips look at Le Express for me tips
I'm not sure about this complies there
are complex tips I should maybe order
some but I'm quite satisfied with these
for me tips
I think T 200 is the diameter
for this intercept for one $2 yeah I
hope you like this anyhow somehow just
wanted Toto to clear up this this
confusion it sounds way off it doesn't
it's just the recording which sounds off
and I tried to do my best
I didn't check it well maybe so I should
have checked I just took the recording
from the x3 from last time
recorded this one you with a new
equalizing which is different and then I
thought at the end somehow it appears
were sounding why but in reality I
personally think it sounds better for
all the others asking me to review that
error or some other model I don't want
I'm satisfied with this all the other
should sound mod is the same I just know
that when looking at the response
measurements from ratings that the
freedom the old version the f5 sounds
different than the if to a freedom tool
you have the response for the freedom
you can see the speak they probably
measured it with the original tips and
here for the freedom tool overlaid as
you can see more based on how the
balance changed while when I overlay the
x3 or x4 you can see they measure mall
is the same but also here it depends how
deep they put it inside which which
keeps the used and so on and so on
therefore there are too many factors
that influence the sound so it's not not
quite easy to really get something valid
yeah I don't want to borrow more I hope
I could clear up everything for those
still questioning I mean I haven't heard
a better one for that money I got just
the original King audio t2 because mine
you know remember the first one that I
got was program it was playing all of
phase 4 left and right that in order to
pro forget it
doesn't sound good that it - or the the
original t2 which is discounted no for
20 $25
I think it's okay it's really okay I
don't want to make any of you anymore
but I want to tell you my but still the
treadle is too metallic so the balance
treble mid space is somehow off basis
okay nicely flat base so for those who
want more base yet this is not there
here for you you are probably some pay
set because I always sometimes think if
you get a good seal that that in order
to re sounds a little bit in boo me so
it's not completely flat but it's
nowhere close to the freedom regarding
the smoothness of sound travel is way
smoother and with the equalizer can
influence it even more therefore yeah
for 20 25 bucks or whatever it goes for
now but in order T to the original one
is definitely nice I haven't heard the
gt3 and I'm not interested I'm not
interesting any other indie anymore just
an automatic er tool which should arrive
maybe next week into week so I might try
to do another video on this and give you
my opinion if it's read at grade 450
$160 it could be a nice alternative to
them er 3 maybe or to the ER for even I
don't know
and then yeah I'm done I'm simply not
interested any other ones there's this
biodynamic event or a Volant or whatever
4200 euros I mean come on it's nothing
true islands with somewhere in between
have it is excelent for wireless I would
really thousand two hundred euros Tesla
in here I'm really I would like to hear
this so just to see how crappy it really
is yeah but I don't care I am satisfied
with a $50 in here which sounds really
amazing especially with the help of some
some internal EQ and that's it
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
sorry guys but this whole YouTube
is really I have to look for something
here and I started by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
