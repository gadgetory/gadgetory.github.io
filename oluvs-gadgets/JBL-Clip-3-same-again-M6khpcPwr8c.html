quickly check out the brand new JBL clip
3 which has just arrived now this is the
success of the clip 2 which you maybe
remember was a little bit disappointing
so let's hope this one is quite a bit
better especially for $60 you might
expect some improvement over the very
old JBL clip which is I think more than
three years old but this one is already
based on an even all the design from JBL
this becomes called JBL micro tool it
didn't even have bluetooth later on they
released a wireless version called micro
helis I think this was around five years
ago so yeah the sound didn't change that
much it still sounds the same as the
very old version so let's hope this one
is yeah an improvement they had five
years to improve the sound so I hope
they did something so let's open the box
and yeah have a look inside
quite nice design quite steep here let's
put this away and the design has
definitely improved over the three years
also at the back you can see this nice
3d effect of the it's not a passive
razor just some here the ability to the
same so all speakers from them have not
the same design language yeah last time
I was criticized when I compared the JBL
go tool with the Bose Soundlink micro
that it's more than twice as expensive
the problem is I just wanted to show you
what would be possible out of a speaker
size like that you can see the size
difference is not that much but yeah I
won't use the boss now let's first
compare it maybe against the very old
version and later on against the cheaper
speaker they tried it Exxon Co which
cost around thirty five thirty six
dollars so nearly half the price of the
GBO so that you can judge by yourself if
it's really that decent I will turn both
on this one still had the old GBL tones
the new one has Chaka bloom
it sounds a little bit distorted also
it's quite slippery here
as always I'm using binaural microphones
therefore you should listen with
headphones I will start with the GPL
clip 3 first bottom is already quite
high but the volume curve is a bit
strange here so let's start with the
first track you can hear it has again
this strange limiting problem becoming a
louder I will reduce the volume of this
one this one sounds more dynamic maybe
meets a slightly metallic
you could hear volume drops again
so I will reduce when we re we already
had this problem on the GBA clip tool
and now with the third generation I mean
this is ok as Nimitz adds really high
levels but this one limits already at
low levels so they didn't improve they
still have the same error I cannot
understand this I mean this is a more a
premium speaker for $60 let's run our
track again some volume drop here meet
set may be improved slightly because
is this a little bit strange that's why
this right
we need sounds more hollow from the old
one the bass is better I would say
console a bit more hallelujah
let's reverse again some volumes of as
soon as some DC part comes in which
reduces volume
so I'll increase volume on both the Holy
Ghost mixing so I thought it will become
any louder yes mr. Morgan
your goal is the same loudness some
mates I'm definitely better from the new
one but it's still quite creepy you
could hear it sounds just cheap so let's
compare it against a cheaper speaker
like that rabbit exon go around 36
dollars I think but sometimes you can
get it with some discount so don't tell
me this is unfair yeah it's a little bit
larger but still I think it's really
nicely Hannibal so let me see both are
connected and again the clip 3 the tribe
it can think we already stopped here as
the difference is just night and day
sorry next gonna hear this yeah let's
reduce volume for more comfortable
listening maybe listen to the difference
here yeah I mean JBL has a huge research
department with really great people like
Floyd mr. dr. Floyd dr. Floyd tool and
they are not aware of human loudness
contours that a teeny sonic speaker at
lower levels were sounding more teeny so
they don't apply any kind of loudness
compensation I mean this is $60 is $36
come on
no sorry let's increase volume again
maybe performs better at higher levels
whether the dynamics is reduce very meet
focus yeah that's right this right let's
check them at high level services to
drive it increasing to maximum
and here something is here so yeah not
sure I'm not sure mmm and yeah I won't
use the pose but I wanted to show you
how great a speaker in comparable size
can sound this is the mini Eric mini
cost yet twice the price but I think
it's definitely worth it
as you will hear so let's check this
tool again JBL flip three first mate on
a beeper like this
in Romania
he explains the price but the sound is
more than twice as good I mean and not
even comparable so
sounds like some cheap clock-radio nice
for this increase volume because became
soft again
play nice and mix without this strange
honk eNOS so again reducing volume
slightly for more brake back
conditioning and check out the mini yeah
I mean I cannot pick a speaker seriously
with this sound for $60 this is really
this cheek to ask that much money for it
that's why this right it's quite a
difference no bass nothing the Travis
also I did
I think you can hear the difference here
it's twice the price but you get what
you pay for it it's ready strike reduce
phonetic volatility better is GB it
becomes softer and some lot of parts
come in and this is a night and day
difference
so check all out these can play this is
the G B and E 3 maximum multiple half as
long
so hmm why should I pay $60 for this
piece of crap when I can get this one
for half the price and this one for
double the price yeah I'm not sure now I
will be hated because I'm bashing JBL no
I'm not bashing JBL and bashing the
speaker it's complete crap
hardly any better than a speaker which
was released five six years ago even
worse thanks for the strange limiting
compression effects I think they have
some it seems to be some oversight they
didn't realize it they had the first
time it was I think with the JBL go
which was released later after the first
JBL clip then the same error went into
the JBL go to the JBL clip - yeah -
three wrath so I'm confused with all the
names and it's a great-looking speaker
but sounds so creepy for $60 you can get
so many other better ones the larger
ones even small ones I think this is
this cheap I'm not sure what I revealed
was some poor onyx or some trans man I
don't know it was way better than this
for 20 or 15 dollars so for $60 this is
really waste of money and I'm not being
haters sorry I like the GBO
extreme - it sounds nice but it also has
some issues at high levels not really
that lot for this size so this one is
really complete crap no real advancement
no real progress during the last five
years they made it waterproof come on I
don't need this this one is also
waterproof and has way better battery
life the battery is huge inside so yeah
I think someone claimed that better half
is so great ten hours I'm not sure how
long it would last at maximum the poses
came forth from rated for six hours but
it makes me eat place for nearly 5 hours
so when this is rated for 10 hours it
makes you it might play maybe four to
three hours yeah I saw some of you from
a guy who claimed that the boss only
plays for one and a half this is not
true nearly 5 hours at maximum volume
which is quite impressive not even the
mini mini manages this this place for 3
hours mixing but you got here twice as
lot or even louder
better sound overall so just yeah wanted
to show you that you get what you pay
for I mean when you paste $120 or
something for this this will be a much
better choice than $60 for this all you
has some hopeless JBL fanboy who just
thinks just because JBL is written on it
it's great no sorry this is really crap
it's also as if there was some some
compression some some low bitrate yeah
yeah it's sorry it's not it's not a fake
one from China it sounded like some
copied China tone this is originally
from Harman Kardon so no I make use that
I'm I don't know reviewing fakes because
no this is I bought this from JBL
directly so it cannot be faked as this
video original let's listen to the tone
again here sounds horrible if I want to
use such tones then please make them at
least sound good but this sounds
horrible yeah again huge disappointment
from JBL here with the JBL clip three
waste of time a waste of time to review
it and also a waste of money
yeah it's nice it can float on water but
I mean this one can also float on water
and look it as soon as you put into
water it starts to flash some cannot do
it so my son will definitely have more
fun with this then I think I'd paid
three dollars for this this costs sixty
so I hope this was helpful I will
include it into my database so we can
hear by yourself that it's here crap
hardly any improvement over the one
meter maybe slightly smoother but treble
became worse then from the old one and
the old one had at least three Samsung
my son put some double double sided tape
on it and to stick stuck it to objects
to his car and so on he really likes it
and I think it's nice and three four
years ago this was really great but now
nowadays this is complete crap sorry
yeah I don't want to insult any JBL
fanboy but please open your eyes open
your ears don't buy this junk here
if it cost maybe 10 $15 okay that's nice
but with this sound quality and all
these limiting issues it's really waste
of time and waste of money
wait stop all right so I hope I didn't
waste your time I hope you liked this
video yeah I'm trying to be as unbiased
as possible and still I'm accused I
cannot trust you because you have your
favorites I mean for $35 you get here
way better performance and from the
speaker so of course there has to be a
good one and a bad one so the trial it
is in this case a good one not the best
one but for 35 36 dollars it will be
hard to find really much much better
ones so again thanks for watching and
see in the next year have a nice time
and bye bye
