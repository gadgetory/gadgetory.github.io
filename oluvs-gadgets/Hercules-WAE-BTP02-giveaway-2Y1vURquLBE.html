with a new video which will start
immediately with the first giveaway here
I have the heck ulis waa e bt po2 it's
maybe not the best sounding speak around
but I was surprised when I compared it
against some more premium models like
for example that Bose Soundlink 3 that
it simply outperformed it at high levels
it played much louder with no distortion
no compression or bass reduction but
simply pure sound while the bow started
to well sound a bit strange of course I
would like to show you how it sounds how
loud it can play and you should wear
headphones for the best results later on
I will give you more details about the
giveaway so please put up your
headphones and we will have a listen as
you can see I place them far away as we
will playing them at higher levels this
time and because most of you probably
know how the JBL tracks to sounds and
how loud it can play I thought I'll
choose this one as contender for the
Hercules many always complaining I don't
play any hip-hop so I thought I'll start
with a hip-hop track and the Hercules
first
I was calculus for maximum
you can see the Hercules has an upward
tilt so you can also place it on the
ground and should still have quite good
sound from above again both
yeah the difference in loudness is
pretty obvious
what him again let's put them on a table
it has a nice stereo image I think there
is some additional sphere of processing
something
because the JIRA Church appear Alamo
as today is my birthday
I would like any of my subscribers
having the chance to get the speaker you
just have to answer the simple question
or guess it how old I became today but
first some more details about the
speaker it has claimed 20 hours plus of
battery life it's a stereo system there
are indeed two drivers inside and it's
bass reflex we can see the port at the
back here it has 30 watts of big power
Wireless range of 10 meters and an own
app which lets you customize the sound
to participate simply sending an email
to all apps gadgets at gmail.com with
the subject calculus so I can filter for
the right messages and my age I would
like to wish everyone good luck the
winner will be announced on the 31st of
January I hope you like this as a first
giveaway for this year that will be
coming much more of course more sound
checks and so on so stay tuned have a
nice time and bye bye
