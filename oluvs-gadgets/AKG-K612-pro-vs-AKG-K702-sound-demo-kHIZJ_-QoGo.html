present to the AKG k612 prom especially
compared against the AKG K 702 we
already heard this in my classics
comparison against a by the enemy TT 880
and the sennheiser HD v 8x and the AKG
was by far the worst also confirmed by
oh so the sound is somehow colored harsh
a little bit thin and although the K 600
grit model it sounds definitely better
it is in my opinion so I don't like the
K seminar - at all although it's claimed
to be a reference to your headphone why
the K hundred K six on 12 is just
referenced class headphone I think there
are mall is based on the same design you
can see not much changes here because
difference is that this one has an
exchangeable cable with an own
proprietary connector like some pin type
or whatever and the ear cuffs are angled
as you can see not sure if you can see
this but at the front there are more
narrow here they are broader so this
should maybe improve the angle how this
sound gets into your ear but in the end
it sounds worse also both are quite
quite a position dependent you can see
the ear cuffs are quite big so there is
lots of space for your use
unfortunately yeah if I put them up
centered the sound is not that great you
don't have to put up the you know heads
your cups more up so that appreciate it
doesn't stay like this you can see I
already put put up some sticky tape so
this band here adjusts to your head you
can see automatically there is no way to
snap it in like you have with normal
headphones like with the Sennheiser here
you can adjust the headband and it snaps
in quite well well here it simply goes
up and then it rather hangs but I have
to get the best sound I have to rather
have it upwards here not centered
because then the treble doesn't doesn't
sound right becomes quite harsh but more
pronounced with this here so these
angled
ear cuffs hip heads don't help well and
comfort wise them all is the same but I
think the biggest difference is really
the sound they still sound similar but
the k612 probe being the cheaper model
here in Europe you can get it below
hundred euros so even fifty euros or six
euros depending how much you pay for
them for shipping and taxes so I think
it's quite a nice headphone quite open
sounding with a nice soundstage not
really busy but not thin either while
this sounds a little bit colored but
first I would like to show you how the
sound changes depending on the position
when I put it up here so I will play
another proof so Poisson process future
and move it around a little bit so you
can hear how much the the especially
treble changes a lot when you move it so
it's really also hard for me to know how
to place it correctly I try to get the
recording in such a way like I hear it
in reality but it's all it all I don't
have them centered but rather my ears
are at the bottom of the ear pads and I
think like this it's a staff lead based
so I will switch over to this microphone
and we can have a listen no you should
hear me left left right right
a funny thing is that with these ears
here it's exactly the opposite so I have
to put it rather down to get the best
sound so I think I have positioned it
well now and let's compare it against a
k7r - I will play three songs switch
back and forth and at the beginning and
at the end you will always hear the
original track so let's have a listen
is it just a treat my baby inside my
fantasy come to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the part of
you
rickety
am i searching you I wanna feel
these
the headphone recordings here are quite
close to what I hear in reality when
listening for SN Heiser HTC cannot have
the Sonics profile so I think the
relative differences should also be
quite representative but now let's look
at some measurements they still sound
similar particular here there is
definitely some difference and the k7r -
sounds more coloured so here is the AKG
k612 probe for left and right you can
see the trail is not balanced that well
but it's more less the same for the k7r
- which I would put below so we can see
both at the same time so channel
matching is not that great for both and
you can see the case under - has this
strange deep at 3 kilohertz which I
didn't see in any other measurements but
it definitely shows up in the
measurement and it's also here able I
will average left and right for both the
k612 Pro and the k7r - so we can read
them a little bit better and overlaid
you can see that the case NR 2 has less
bass also the peaks at 5 &amp;amp; 8 cards are
more pronounced there is also some
slight hump at Pooh kilohertz
so even from the measurements it's
obvious that the k6r 12 prong is that
meta sounding one although it has some
Peaks not as strong as the case in our -
it's still quite neutral sounding a
little bit fresher maybe so let's
compare it against the sennheiser HD 58
X Jubilee but without the inlays here so
it also gets a little bit more treble
heavy and they become maybe more
comparable like this so I will start
again with them AKG k612 prom playing
the original track and the beginning at
the end and switch between them AKG and
the Sennheiser so let's have a listen
is it just a dream of a man stop my
fantasies come to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you come to me
we can't do
we can't be
am i touching you I wanna feel
you could hear it's not that bad there
is some slight channel imbalance
therefore they definitely sounded
different with imaging and Sun stage but
I think for 100 euros it's a great open
headphone just be careful how to place
it on your head yeah maybe your ears are
different but when I have them sent that
it doesn't sound good
so treble gets rather masked where is 5
kilo Hertz boost here but apart from
that it's definitely somehow fresher
sounding when the HD 58 X Jubilee less
bass but still somehow enjoyable it's
closer to what ie from the automatic er
3 XR so when I compare back and forth
the AKG definitely has a more direct
sound compared to the Sennheiser which
is any bit muted again the term that I
always read is sennheiser wheel but yeah
depends I mean it's a little bit more
expensive here I don't like this this
headband so I really had to adjust
promissory but I will probably do it
with some glue I don't know so that it
doesn't move upwards all the time but
it's a really great headphone for around
100 euros much better than many others I
definitely enjoyed more than the I had
anemic DT 800 AD or many others quite
neutral sound despite some Peaks I think
it's quite acceptable and makes it
simply a ple bit fresher yeah this was
it for the AKG k612 Pro definitely much
much better than the 702 overall still
both sound similar this is to such a
degree worse than it becomes
unacceptable to me I cannot listen to
this and this position dependence here
is even worse because it really hard to
get the sound right well here just
putting it a little bit upwards makes it
sound just fine so I hope this was
helpful for you to give you an idea
about the AKG k612 especially compared
against some kind of reference like the
sennheiser HD 58 X Jubilee which is only
available on mass drop the soup
get everywhere still he's written made
in China so but I think it's okay really
really nice at home and a keeper for me
I just let it like this because yeah the
wire is a lipid pool long maybe two
meters or something but really really
recommended if you want some fresh
sounding sparkling open headphone which
still is neutral and not to some degree
colored neck most yeah thanks for
watching I hope you like this a little
bit and see the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
