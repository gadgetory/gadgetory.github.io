a look and also listen to the sony in
the rx100 10 AP i think this is quite a
popular indie by sony although a little
bit older but here he says for
smartphones high quality sound you can
find it on amazon currently from $20 and
i was asked by one of my viewers if i
could review it so i insert a well no
it's probably crap the whole MDI line is
crap then he asked me if I was
generalizing and I said well yes look I
have heard the MV rx 750 which is a
higher class model and it was crap here
I have one from Sony quite old I think
about 15 years old the sony MDR X 71
back then also highly regarded sounds
like crap even the top model there Sony
and the RX 1000 I am not sure what this
cost back then also highly regarded but
when just by looking at the measurements
it must sound like crap I've never heard
it but it's enough to see this peak at
around five kilos so for me the whole
MDI line is dead I mean but then I
thought yeah maybe I'm missing something
I will order it I told him look I just
wasted 18 euros and I will make this
video just for you then he was so kind
to send me some donation of $10 or euros
so I didn't waste that much and here it
is quite a simple in the neck driver
quite comfortable packaging I didn't
manage to open it nicely so I tore it up
inside are some additional tips I think
these are the typical sony hybrid tips
some manual also something like this I'm
not sure if it's only for the packaging
or if you can wire it up like this I'm
not quite sure but it looks genuine to
me so it's not some fake I think looks
original and I won't talk about sound I
will let you listen I will put it inside
here and you should get a nice idea
about the general tuning the general
sound of course don't take it absolutely
and we'll compare it against the Sony
and 8750
this is a stripped-down version of the
NH one male models based on it but it's
cheaper I found it on Amazon for 6 euros
on the US Arizona store can also find it
find it for $20 so quite comparable so
let's compare these to put upright
phones and let's check them out
is it just a treat my lovingly inside my
fantasies call to me you are in my
thoughts I never straight from the heart
of you to me
am i searching you I wanna feel
yeah I think just the singsong is
worried enough to realize that it sounds
like crap especially compared against
the Sony MH 750 or well not perfect too
much bass also slightly recessed meets
still sounds way smoother than this but
I was quite surprised that the recording
captured it so nicely in reality I hear
it even worse I hear way more of this
strange whistling here with the
recording it came out quite ok I would
say so let's see what's going on here I
will show you some measurements and you
will say yeah look what it measures
quite flat the bronies this is an
uncompensated measurement I will overlay
the Sony MH 750 also uncompensated you
can see it has this natural 3 kilohertz
peak and then the response goes down so
there shouldn't be any additional Peaks
until treble is reached you can see the
next peak is at around 12 kilo Hertz I
will show them compensated for the
diffuse field target and now you can see
that the MDR X 110 ap has a strong peak
at 6 kilohertz and also the treble peak
is way higher based extension is better
on the MH 750 but the X 110 ap has more
upper base so I'm really not sure
I mean don't people hear this that it
sounds off maybe I'm oversensitive but
there is a peak it also shows up in the
measurement and it shows up in most
measurements of Sony in ears you know I
found some from the sony MDR x 1000 it
has a horrible peak at 5 kilohertz even
the measurement from in a fidelity shows
it I mean this is 10 DB peak and nobody
complains about this
how can it be I'm not sure am i
oversensitive or are most people deaf or
don't take care that human you can't be
so different that some here this peak or
get annoyed by it while others don't
the peak is there which is not natural
because in a thematic or a neutral
sounding it doesn't have this peak
therefore I'm surprised that still many
people like this when looking on Amazon
here what does he say I like these
better than my $150 headphones and he
come on how can it be then you must have
some really horrible ones for 150 and
all of these are orrible I mean 90 95
percent in years are just horrible
therefore it so hard to find a really
decent one there are some four thousand
two thousand dollars that sound horrible
and still people buy them and not sure
why and they claim they sound good with
others of some pigs 10 15 DB Peaks and
nobody cares for this if I had a speaker
with such a big nobody would buy this
but somehow with it is a net force
people don't care it sounds nice
I have some 15 DB peak here at six blows
but it sounds friendly therefore I'm
really I I I cannot explain all this I
mean you can get used to this after some
time you think it's okay but it doesn't
sound good
I mean the M itself it is not perfect
but it blows this away completely there
ivan some walls i think there is some
port you could maybe try closing it to
reduce bass also i am using the final
audio III thousand tips because it
smoothens up travel a little bit it's
not that that smooth with the original
hybrid tips with the final audio tips
it's really nice it's okay i can listen
with this but with this no i put it in a
and I heard this whistling and I thought
come on it's breaking my ears later on I
got some kid who's from this especially
if you crank it to maximum with such
peak so this is my take on the sony MDR
X 110 AP stay away from this you can get
much better ones for a similar price or
even for for cheaper and if I don't
don't understand why people complain
about decent or normal sounding in ears
like the Samsung s8 bundle or Samsung
earphone to buy EKG and then they
recommend such crap saying that this
sounds better or whatever I'm not sure
it's really this makes me really want to
stop everything because either my
perception of sound is off or all the
others
kara or their they have no idea I'm not
sure but this is unlistenable this is
really all those sony MDR line is like
this they have some peaks at five six
kilohertz and I wonder why nobody cares
about this why hey nobody yeah throws
this away why I'm really not sure
come on and this is not great
perfect Leeds thousand times better than
than the other one
yeah what's coming up next I have the
automatic er 4x are put through there
how do you say in English paces pay I
will compare it against the automatic er
3 XR because there are there are some
claims that they sound the same or
similar so I would like to clear this up
and yeah I hope you will like this I
hope you like this but comfort a really
decent sounding one and forget all this
crap is sounding junk or this biodynamic
violin what whatever forget them forget
the hype yeah Excel for watching and see
you in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
