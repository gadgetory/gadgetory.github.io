got this yesterday already but I wanted
to wait to open it together with you
this is from Hong Kong from a company
called make make with Q and they make
some new kind of Bluetooth speaker with
aluminium body and replaceable or
exchangeable battery let's have a look
yeah like this you can swap the battery
oh yeah this looks a bit all right so I
think this is inside here they are new
on the market so it doesn't exist yet
but it should arrive pretty soon and
they sent me this first sample to check
it out which I will do know this is
solver shell which means yes they looked
inside the customs of course had a look
this is not so easy
I have no idea what to expect
just some paper I think they told me
that the speaker should cost around $150
it's called sound jump Wireless portable
speaker
he looks pretty unique compared to most
other ones let's check it out very nice
packaging value really high quality
series and this is the speaker sound
jump those be charging port USB charging
out should the battery summer here yet
also USB
okay so it seems to be four maybe we
should try connecting to see how it
sounds
I hope try connecting from my iPhone
make some jump it's here but I there is
some hiss and we could have a short
listen let's see that volume is in sync
a little bit wield I have the mini Eric
here which we've just heard in the
recent video I think it should be
comparable hundred fifty maybe hundred
seventy dollars so let's listen how this
boat compare
this is Maxim volleyball
I would crank up the eunuch as well
the trebles of its resonant and misses
simply definition
maybe let's play for my cab
it's still real and we are closed for
maximum volume already
yeah I don't know sound wise maybe not
that great and I am bit Orwell irritated
by this he's here the Mirek has nothing
so yeah I like the design it's really it
feels great looks great but well yeah
maybe it should burn in first yeah it
took the long way from Hong Kong so it
needs maybe some time to accommodate to
the climate here in Austria to the folly
climate so thanks for watching guys I
hope this was enough for a first
impression I will of course I'll do more
about this sound jump here and yeah
let's have a look later have a nice time
and bye bye
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
