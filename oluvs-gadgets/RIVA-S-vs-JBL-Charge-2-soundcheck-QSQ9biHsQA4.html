be interested how the superstar portable
speaker JBL charge to compares against
the new revised the JBL charge 2 is much
cheaper but the River s is rather tuned
for high five why I would call the JBL
charge 2 rather a kind of boombox I mean
it's not a bad sounding speaker it's
really great but it's it has boosted
bass boosted treble and a kind of what I
would call one node bass it has a high
peak at 75 Hertz which makes always some
bass notes louder than the others while
the river is more tuned for a flat
frequency response I would like to play
some songs as always using binaural
microphones so if you listen with
headphones you should get a realistic
impression I won't judge the sound just
play some music and let you do the final
judgement so let's have a listen I'm
starting with the Rivas and then I will
switch over to the JBL
always leave Hellmouth don't put no
makeup on
no deep tuba father's bit don't be shy
and proud of all maybe something else
you can hear how the punch of the bass
drum kills the entire dynamics you only
have up a bump but everything else
that's strong the way
it's for something else
the trick from savasana
also here the river plays the whole
dynamics while the Medici BL that bass
drum kills everything
the tibial applies some strange kind of
compression even maybe some expander
which always make the bass-drum pump but
this drones away the whole rest this
works well for house music and so on but
it does need some that great with normal
music with lots of dynamics and so on
let's try again something else here you
will hear and the difference pretty well
and they are volume pumping as soon as
bass comes in the whole song becomes
drawn away becomes softer that becomes
louder again when the bass stops
here it's normal just like it was
recorded let's listen something else
again another kind of rock
maybe Punk
something from local Tourette's songs
video completely is a punch base of
everything else remains in the
background also the treble starts to
become a bit sizzling
with this trick that balls struggled
quite a bit I think the trivial charge
is better in this regard it tries to
keep the base in the foreground all the
time but does not distort at least I
will turn both for maximum
this is this a typical house song how
differently they both render the bass
family written knowledge area here you
can always have our thumb here the bass
drum is far not as pronounced as with
the GBL
but throws away everything else this is
Morris solid dynamics the JBL always
makes this it works well for house but
everything else stops sounding a bit
strange house gets this extra fun
bom-bom-bom let's listen to some rock
yet another JBL obviously struggle city
the compressor penalty cannot quite
handle this
yeah I hope it was obvious I hope it was
clear what I wanted to show you I mean
they are both great sounding speakers
but simply different for different
tastes for different purposes that JBL
really sounds great with house you get
this mop while the river keeps the
dynamics more constant it doesn't apply
any kind of compression or something so
of course there is a little bit but you
don't hear it it's not as noticeable as
with the JBL or that the Bose Soundlink
mini which is extreme with compressing
it there is a way all bass pushes meats
and starts compressing as hell and well
but the JBL still sounds yeah are usable
especially with houses you get this but
what what with the river you want this
is more a speaker for real
audio I don't know how they are called
in English audio files or audio fields
don't know if it's worth paying the
double price for the river compared to
the JBL depends on your taste on your
yeah on your I don't know so I hope it
was helpful somehow I tried using
different channels again with more
vocals maybe so thanks for watching and
we'll see us in the next video have a
nice time and bye bye
just a quick Pisa as the postman left
something in front of the door thank
goodness he didn't ring the bell and I
could finish my recordings this is the
total rock star excess and another one
yeah this will be quite interesting and
something else came as well I hope you
can read it
meaning Rick I haven't looked inside yet
but I think I know what's inside
yeah no no there is another compartment
you can expect some interesting
comparisons we have the mini Rick here
another mini reek and the mini Rick's up
so stay tuned for more interesting
comparisons and yeah we will see us then
bye bye lock the camera vote summer what
is the complete ask Charlotte the
education that he hit superwoman it
should be not enslave try me Newton
your compassed know yet himself so yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
