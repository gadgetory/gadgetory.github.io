have my speaker audio database where you
can compare us because to each other by
yourself also for free as I offer this
at no cost people are still asking me if
I could compare this because of that one
and so on problem is I don't have all of
them at home anymore some of them are
sold some are sent back but I still have
the Harman Kardon go in play and the AIA
XS 9 many were asking for this
comparison end yet they both sound
really great although different still
quite similar the most obvious
difference is that the IVA is much
louder and the Harman Kardon much
smaller it weighs around half the weight
of the Iowa but there is also some
difference in battery life as the Harman
Kardon go and play at maximum will play
for around maybe two hours while the
Iowa will manage three hours and is at
the same time quite a bit louder you can
also exchange and swept the battery for
another one with the ayah if you have a
spare battery there is also a double
capacity battery which should give you
here maybe six or is it maximum but
we'll concentrate on sound and later on
I will also show you the difference in
loudness at normal levels it's
definitely a matter of taste which you
prefer the armor of the hammer can go
and play sounds may be a bit more open
the Iowa has slightly more upper base
you can of course adjust the sound with
that either with the built-in equalizer
the Harman Kardon current play doesn't
have any but I said the equalizer on the
IVA for neutral so or let's say for off
so we can hear how they sound with it's
with their stock tuning as always i'm of
course using binaural microphones so you
should listen with headphones I would
start with the Harman Kardon going play
and an acoustic track later on we'll
also play some electronica stuff and
yeah please have a listen
something else
Yago they are matched volume buyers the
IVA has some limited built in which
sometimes he pushes volume up or down
depending on the sound so it's really
not easy to match them for all souls
this is the Harman Kardon mode
I refuse maybe slightly louder come on a
song let's call it up ago in the 90s
this was called a sea chest high bar
yeah you can make it sound slightly more
booming play again
Trek from Seoul / freesia
if they some difference in sound
although Metro face which will ignite
another frack this is from the German
electronica composure Sunchaser you can
maybe hear the limiter to working
slightly here I have the latest firmware
update installed and I contacted Iowa
because of this but there doesn't seem
to be any fix currently it's especially
noticeable as at low levels you can
maybe hear that it tries to push volume
down
Yeah right a slide click on play again
another crack some world music down
painful
this is from British royalty free
composure and lumo music
we offered me to use all these threads
so thanks for that in the Iowa yeah
right a bit more upper base this could
be of course you want done with some
equalizer
both are not flat sandal if you can
maybe hear before I macadam sounds a bit
more open
sam'l effect also from a low LUMO music
some kind of rock
you can hear the limit on again
Conte play again
you
something else also from Illuminism
you know that I definitely sounds softer
so trying matching them again
maybe some dubstep
this difference in overall speakers
response is pretty obvious here on a
song and you will be of course
interested in hearing the difference in
overall loudness the go in place already
playing a bass our volume so I will
increase volume from excellent
this is the Harman Kardon burn cleaner
they're gone now they are met more or
less
I will increase dive up to maximum as
well
so you can hear the differences really
big between these two
go and play again also becomes it is the
porti need an untracked maybe
this maximum undergoing play
you
yeah it's weeded out
don't blink enough computer
so if you are after it makes you love it
that is definitely the way to go
Kamala Fred
yeah that is really crazy
how do we use volume again on both
yes I told you definitely a matter of
taste of all on this wise the Hammond
car don't go and play cannot quite
compete but it's also way smaller as you
can see it's about maybe half or
one-third the size three and a half
kilograms this has close to six so
depends what you like both are great and
here in Europe they both should cost
around the same in America still the
Hammond cannot go and play goes for 399
so hundred dollars more expensive than
the Iowa but yeah I hope this was
helpful to show you and demonstrate you
the difference between both check them
out again within the database or
switcher yes I cannot say anything more
yes I told you both are really great and
top speakers within its class
outperforming most others
I really like the Harman Kardon because
it's so small but still pick some punch
but of course it's not as loud as the i1
so if you want to make some party yeah
take the I bar and it should do the
trick
also the double capacity battery which
cause I don't know exactly but I heard
it should cost around $70 or $80
you should get five six hours at maximum
easily the man can go and play yeah has
the battery built-in which is of course
a pity so if it dies once you will have
to probably open the speaker somehow and
I don't know this is really a pity that
still many companies don't really take
this topic seriously I mean I heard of
lots of users and owners of a Ghibli
extreme where the battery died after one
year and now it's it's more a
paperweight so it with the Iowa you can
easily exchange the battery at the back
you have there you have it here just
pull it out first let's turn it off let
me see it's um
not that easy but here we have the
battery just put in another one and yeah
okay now you can do this on the go if
you have a second one so yeah a matter
of taste
definitely both are great but I cannot
tell you which one I prefer more as yet
both are a little bit different as well
so I hope this was helpful thanks a lot
for watching and see you in the next
video have a nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
