do a quick check of the simple v10 they
were already impressed about the speaker
and someone also asked me why I didn't
include it within my Christmas
low-budget video yea the speaker goes
for $60 so it would definitely fit in
quite well but I also think it's
currently in a kind of work-in-progress
state when I heard it the first time I
was not that impressed I contacted a
company and they told me that they can
improve it probably they are currently
working on it maybe it can be updated
for micro USB or through SD card but who
knows when this will yeah when this will
be so I thought we'll check it out first
now and maybe we will also check it out
later when the update is here but first
yeah let's have a look at the speaker
yeah it's quite big maybe a little bit
similar to a bill play a tool but also a
little bit of a fee file syncing but
quite a bit larger so you see it's yeah
it's quite fat yeah we've already seen
there is charging down through micro USB
it has SD card playback this is the main
on/off switch so let's turn it on
Bluetooth mode yeah device you also know
maybe this voice yes sounds a little bit
like some British Butler I don't know
but providing listen yeah let's check
out some frequency response measurement
and you can see here one with normal EQ
mode it has three different EQ modes and
it measures a little bit wavy I don't
know where all these tips come from
but overall the frequency response would
be quite natural except these tips you
can also see some stronger treble peak
at around 12 kilo Hertz and the base
already rolls off around hammerheads
there is still some response down to 50
Hertz maybe but it rolls off much too
quickly if we have a look at the second
EQ mode which is called bass you can see
that the whole bass area is boosted
together with tribbles so the peak
becomes even higher and you can see the
third EQ mode which is called voice or
something it boosts the presence area
around 2 3 4 kilohertz slightly but at
the same time the lower base gets
reduced even more apart from that this
would be maybe the best sounding EQ mode
if not the stronger bass loss compared
to maybe the first EQ mode we can check
out some lower levels and you see that
there is some loudness compensation so
bass gets boosted dynamically but this
only works if you control volume
directly on a speaker and
maxima on the other hand the speaker
does not reduce bass much so it remains
really punchy even at maximum and now
you will probably want to know how the
sounds as always i'm of course using
high quality binaural microphones and a
head cam to give you a kind of
first-person view so please put up your
headphones and let's check it out i will
play a track from afro elements as some
personal remix so please have a listen
if i reduce volume on my player but
increase volume on the speaker it
remains quite tinny sounding if we do
the opposite reducing volume on the
speaker while increasing volume on the
player it becomes more full-bodied so
that bass gets boosted these also work
as track controls so if you press it
just shortly they skip tracks otherwise
you have to keep volume pressed this is
it humid one EQ more to get a bit of a
bass boost but more in lower pace
instead there is some other bass boost
and this is the third mode which I
think's on space
it's not a faceless there's more clarity
somehow again if you want one although
the treble is really harsh it likes a
little bit of America again base mode it
is sounds just bully
bass drones everything else together
fast
sizzling forever I really think this one
sounds messed up it would again it will
be a bit more lower base maybe check it
out against well-known speaker the PDK
track max or a 34 goes for depends I got
it for around 50 euros but you can get
it for $100 currently on Amazon it's a
very neutral and flat sounding speaker
so we can maybe hear the had the
difference if yeah which one renders the
sounds better I will start again with
their simple and an electric from South
Africa
let's let volume a bit better
Yankee Ramirez treble is quite a bit
excessive why the base is made a big
coup booming but without real lower
pence
it sounds much more legs much novellas
although it gives a bit of a marketing
question because of the strong flavor of
the sea power the treble is little yes
quite a bit too much and on track the
difference in over Africa suppose it's
quite obvious here this song just here
natural I mean it's not a perfect song
speak I'd legs a little bit of treble
definition also bass could be lower but
it sounds like it feel
asymmetric cdk again to hear their
simple is not bad if you just meet their
treble adjust it slightly mini at lower
levels keeping their lower base hi
Patrick
and with real instruments you hear that
something is not quite right here
this sounds yet a bit more natural
of course if you only listen to no
copyright sounds and then stuff the
difference yeah it's hard to notice here
the speaker sounds right or not this is
a track from sunchaser the PDK ass it
all has maybe slightly more punchy sound
I will increase volume here to maximum
so that we can control volume directly
from the yeah this is mixing here and I
will stand up and let's play them at
maximum to see how loud they can play
yeah increasing the volume to maximum no
so simple then you can see it moves
around yeah I think it will fall down
way to hit we will have to put it a bit
further there are only two passive areas
at the back so vibration is a bit
unbalanced let's crank it again for
maximum
also mixing
and now you can hear the lower base
advantage of their of the simple oh but
this would have needed to be to be
pushed a bit for low levels at high
levels yet it's quite a bit more punchy
than the GDK but not as loud
participate definitely reduces space
fighting it more laughs right you can
see how he turns around because of
vibration okay that's quite a bit
the lava slice will see power could be a
bit modernity and Iraq they've all
turned around to the opposite side
I use volume again
so yeah both are not perfect
but I think the simpler would have much
more potential yeah they really turned
around looking away from each other and
you have to reduce volume here and hit
with I said on the player in order to
get more space so yeah currently I'm not
that satisfied because of this excessive
treble your health it's very very
emphasized also base is boosted in the
upper region so you have some bass boost
at two three even four hundred Hertz
especially with this EQ with the second
EQ mode but the lower base is missing
it's there but it should have been
boosted with the DSP there is a DSP
included so maybe they can really
improve it and more I mean it's
definitely nice already now but could be
deaf could be hopefully much better so
let's stay tuned what they will come up
with I hope yeah they will release some
firmware updates soon and then we'll
compare it a game against a TDK or some
other speaker the TDK is quite a bit
smaller but for $50 or 60 curt Lee it's
not that bad but I hope it can improve
you more so maybe next year we will do
another test of the sim power hopefully
with the final tuning until then stay
tuned have a nice time
Happy New Year and see you then bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
