it's a litte bit darker than usual I
hope it's okay like this outside is even
snowing the first time this year or
maybe let's say this season still I
wanted to review the fire fh1 today this
is not the cheapest anymore seventy-five
dollars on Amazon here in Europe even
more expensive with 89 euros so close to
hundred dollars but I got it because of
all the rating all the hype when reading
some comments on YouTube with people
claiming it's the best below Hannah
Dallas or even better than many others
up to two hundred it should sound better
than the fh5 which cost three times as
much so I had to try it out I bought it
directly from the thyristor so it's not
some fake or something
but before talking about salt it's a
leak inside because I think it comes
with some nice accessories like this
great carrying box here I think that is
even waterproof so you could take it for
some Sweden holiday could go swimming
with it inside at wires I think a
balanced one with 2.5 millimeter also
different pairs of tips and this is the
normal wire the in itself is this type
of in-ear monitor worn around your ear
like this I think it's quite comfortable
so more comfortable than those t RN v 20
V 18 which had rather sharp edges
this is rounder so smoother to carry the
wild self is quite okay also has this
belt or a loop so you can wire it
together comes with a remote for an
iPhone I haven't tried out if it works
but sound wise yeah if this has to be
the best below hundred dollars then and
really disappointed but I will simply
let you listen let's pull it here in
inside this is measurement system and we
will compare it against my favorites low
budget ones way cheaper like the Samsung
s8 bundle but keep in mind there are
fake or some bit units around the one I
got here is really decent as a friend of
mine bought it for 5 euros and he's also
is great so 5 heroes vs. 89 euros this
is quite a difference I mean the Samsung
is not perfect but I think it still
sounds considerably better here also the
Sony MH one which is again a step above
these so I would like to
like this that I will first play the
fire fh1 then I will switch over to
their Samsung then the Sony then again
fire Samsung Sony and people complain
that I only play one track yeah I don't
want to bore you with music that you
don't like but I think already this
single track from Seoul s owner should
reveal all difference is quite well as
it represents all frequencies quite
nicely also travel especially traveled
so if the trailer is not right you will
hear this with with this track but today
I will play played three different
tracks so we can maybe judge the sound a
bit better put your headphones up and
let's check it out
we can't
am i touching you I wanna feel
I think would hear none of them was
really dead close to the original
recording but the worst was definitely
the fire fh1 what's the problem here
definitely travel travel has this grainy
characteristics
you could hear there is no definition no
a portrayal justice strange mm no I
won't call it sizzle but some harshness
and you will probably understand it
better if we look at some frequency
response measurements here from the fire
fh1 for the left and right channel you
can see that channel matching is quite
okay but I will average both channel so
we can read this in a bit better on and
you can see that travel has a peak at 10
kilohertz if I overlay the samsung tuned
by EKG in blue here you can see that it
has more bass also a smooth emitter
response and Trevor doesn't have this
tank units peak the peak is rather
shifted towards 1314 kilo Hertz why
there is still some response at 10
kilohertz overlaying the Sony in green
here you can see that base is similar is
under fh1 a little bit more response in
the 3-4 kilo Hertz region and the
trailer peak is in higher we are around
14 kilo Hertz so there is not that much
trouble at 10 kilo Hertz like the fire
which has a 15 DB more and this is the
biggest problem that Trevor is just not
tuned well yeah I tried all different
kind of tips I tried to image one tips
which improved the sound a little bit
but the trailer was still way too harsh
there is too much response in that thank
us Region II keep in mind the human ear
has a resonance at 9 kilo Hertz so if
you have some boosted frequency here it
will become even Harsha so it doesn't
sound that great apart from that it's
quite balanced meets around 3/4 kilo
Hertz maybe not that great so this one
is definitely smoother therefore I don't
quite understand how people can claim
that this sounds better than this only
no it doesn't the sony has a way
smoother way more natural overall
response and the fire of which one
all of them are not neutral but Sony and
Samsung definitely have had quite a
natural response the treble peaks are
shifted way higher so towards 1314
kilohertz
when a peak at 10 kilohertz is just
horrible yeah I really tried everything
I wanted to to like it but it's nothing
special
far from being the best below hundred
dollars even the triple driver from one
more is better than this so I'm sorry
but I cannot follow all the hype again
if the fh5 is even worse then sorry part
it must
be really creepy yeah nothing else to
say it's not that great with a little
and I wouldn't spend $75 for it
okay that's Samsung for $10 or something
but had to beware because there are fake
ones or some replicas around but the one
my friend got for five euros is great as
well the tips I'm using here are sony
hybrid tips I think it sounds better
more open than with the with the
original stock tips the sony sounds
great with the original image one tips
but I would not use rather and latter
ones and not push it too deep inside
simply as far as you get a nice seal
then it should sound really nice
otherwise treble becomes the peak shifts
a little bit lower so yeah Sony and
Samsung still remain my absolute
favorites at their lowest budget class
while in the higher budget class we
still have to find something real decent
up to $100 yeah I hope you like this
anyhow sorry for all those who are
fanboys of the highway which one I
cannot quite follow why because it
doesn't sound that great
yeah bassist nice but it also doesn't
have any great soundstage I think the
sony sounds definitely much broader much
much more 3d than the h1 I was quite
surprised that it's had a little bit of
a mono sound design is great or so that
you can exchange cables but apart from
that it's really nothing that's special
yeah the cable of the Sony is horrible
this this fake thing table here which
dangles around and you have to wear it
behind your neck but apart from that
apart from the cable it's really nice so
yeah see you in the next video with some
Hana
in here or maybe I will go out and do
some outdoor listening yeah it's so nice
with the snow again
but a litte bit cold so stay tuned very
nice time and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
