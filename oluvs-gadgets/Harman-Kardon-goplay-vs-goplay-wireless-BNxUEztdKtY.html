compare the new Harman Kardon go and
play against the old going to play
Wireless and as you can see the new one
is a bit smaller Harman managed to
shrink it to add a rechargeable battery
and some new features that old one
needed eight huge diesels for portable
use I have a dual cells inside now and I
think it's around five kilograms or
something
this has three point four and also
because of this textile finish here it's
definitely more portable more durable
this can scratch easily it's just less
take and yeah the steel grip is still
the same it's a bit thinner but the big
problem of the old wireless version was
that the sound decreased quite a bit
when played from batteries as you can
see I have a switch here so both
attached to me now and I would like to
demonstrate you the difference in sound
of both when playing from mains or from
batteries I will start with the new
Harman Kardon go and play first
and I will turn it off now you hardly
hear any change it just becomes a bit
softer I will turn it on again now let's
try the same with the old one it not
only becomes softer but also thinner I
will switch it on again here this is
some kind of energy-saving management
both are turned off now I mean playing
from battery you can hear much more bass
now from the new version
I will make it one notch louder to match
them again
I will activate mints again yet the
problem is that I will turn the new one
off and the problem is that the sound
becomes so thin that even the small you
play a one will sound fuller when played
against the Harman Kardon go and play I
mean the old version I will start with
the current play first it's playing from
batteries now let's try another track
so the a1 definitely sounds cooler
I will place it maybe like that so both
are more directional it now looks like
some animal with a nose I think you can
hear that the going play lost most of
its advantage when playing from
batteries but I will play some of my
general Jones with both so that you get
a better idea of the sound both will be
playing from mains again and later on we
will also crank them to maximum and have
a listen how much difference there is
with yeah with maximum loudness and so
on let's try another track from from yes
and four elements I will try to match
them volume rise again let's increase
volume slightly football
so I think they are equal August no this
is still one more shoulder
another crack that we don't like
yeah it seems as if the new version was
slightly less directional we can open it
and have a look how the tweeters are
placed and you can see they have similar
placement but it seems as if they were a
bit more facing outwards we can also
have a listen how both sound like that I
will play an our track the treble
becomes a bit yet more dominant the
kahshanna
is it
rickety
yeah I think the new one sounds better
with this grill on it takes away
slightly of this harshness I will reduce
it one notch as I think it's still a bit
louder it's not that easy to match them
and let's try another track
yes till the treble is a bit more
pronounced on the new version base is
similar so they still sound similar but
there are some nuances the new one gives
a bit of a finer impression I will say
they have improved the sound
I also think that the new one is a bit
more spacious
let's try not a trick the base is
slightly different on both but also
3dfunction this has slightly more
pumping base when you want I will tell
males offer both there you put here it
became slightly softer not much maybe
one degree to the beat but the new one
starts becoming
much more punchy let's write a fresh
both play from batteries now
yeah I will put them far away and let's
listen to them at maximum volume I will
reduce the gain of my Cardinal you can
hear my voice becomes softer as I don't
want to have any distortion recorded and
I have my main switch here so I can
switch them on and off remotely but
first let's have a listen to both when
playing from batteries and I will start
turning them to maximum the New Holland
papers
and I will perform excellent
you can hear this some compression
one is also great
a low risk an unknown
and
Oh
yeah the new one is definitely louder
but you can also hear that these p
already yeah too much processing and so
on I will turn it to maximize bass tones
uncompressed over
come up with them all flames from
peperino
our pendulum
yeah the new one is definitely softer
but it still sounds pretty unprocessed
with more bass let's try another track
both playing from maintenance
from Victorino
I will raise the game of my ricotta
again back to normal and I would say
that the new one is definitely a big
improvement over the old one although it
cannot play as loud as the old one from
Maine's you could hear that it struggles
at mixing volume regardless if playing
from mates or from batteries there is
too much processing too much pumping too
much compression while the new one
sounds perfectly balanced and without
any kind of dynamic compression
regardless if playing from battery or
from means it's not as loud but when
both are playing from batteries the new
one still is fuller and more punchy it's
also lighter smaller so yeah although
the price I'm not sure it was 299
announced now it's already available on
the Harman Kardon site in in the US and
it says $4.99 but I think this is bogus
as the Onyx to do 3 should also cost
$4.99 according to them so yeah I hope
this was helpful to give you an idea I
like the old one very much but the new
one is definitely much better for
portable use it has this punchy sound
more refined treble than it was before
there is some harshness with upper mids
which I didn't quite like this new this
new one has definitely improved on that
so thanks a lot for watching and yeah we
will see us in the next video bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
