to talk a little bit about the PR Envy
20 and the 18 is from China so typically
I find they are quite popular I got them
from the been good stuff based on some
raving on an internet or so audio budget
has dat here in its leaderboard
claiming it to be one of the best in its
class so I hoped it would be something
decent
unfortunately it's nothing that special
I would even claim that the cheaper v20
sounds better more balanced dat has some
issues I think it's around 30 $40 this
is around 15 $20 so quite cheap so let
me look at the packaging first before
talking about sound similar packaging
model is the same they are designed like
typical in-ear monitors so this is the
20 I have one in black the wires are
exchangeable by the way so you can swap
it for another wire not sure why you
should but you can so you wear them
around your ear like this like those
typical in your monitors unfortunately
what I get with both they somehow slip
out of my ears so I would have to press
them totally inside but still they come
out and this changes the sound yeah
horribly because if you fumble around
with them you hear how the treble
changes the characteristics we had so
maybe if you have them really perfectly
inside I tried different tips but still
they somehow I'm not maybe it's because
the design they're too broad or
something so when I have them very deep
inside the v20 gets a nice balanced
sound still nothing special but if they
are rather out they are quite harsh both
especially the the 380 year which has
lots of treble boost so compared to my
let's call it maybe reference at around
10 dollars or something there Sony mhm
one this is by the way the original Sony
Ericsson model so you can see it has
this logo here you can also see I have
some sticky tape on it there is a small
pot so if you cover it this will reduce
bass by 2 DB or something there is an
interesting thread in the forum about
the design the current R&amp;amp;D of the
one how yet I also will post a link in
video description so I can check it out
by yourself there are different modes
how you can adjust the sound stick a
hole through the mesh through the
formations on some drill a hole here
inside this also changes the sound so
there was some really buzz about this in
you know many years ago I'm not sure why
this slowed down because the recent
models here are definitely much worse
than this this is a way smoother sound
not perfect but wait it's very musical
very coherent while these sound a little
bit off so mmm later on I will talk to
you I will show you some measurements
now maybe let's have a listen and what I
change this time with the last
recordings for the image one used
smaller tips to get it deeper inside but
this is not the way I usually listen I
you and I listen with the bigger tips
and a rather shallow in insertion so I
rather have it like this and because the
this these tips are some hybrid ones
with different materials they really
stick to the year so like this I get a
different sound so this time I rather
recorded it how I would hear it
not with this deep insertion because
these big tips don't get inside I cannot
put them inside the ear so I rather I
checked that there is really a seal and
there is they they get the form of your
ear so when I just stick them like this
here it's already fine and I did the
same for them TR n VA T and V 20 because
yeah this is how I hear them I don't
hear them when they are deep inside
because I cannot get them deep inside
they always slip out so yeah always as
always keep the samples Radha is a kind
of idea or they have not hundred percent
but they should give you a nice
representation of their relative
differences I think we will start me
with the with every twenty and switch
over to the VA T so you have the direct
comparison and later on we'll compare
the v20 as I think this sounds
definitely better and smoother a
against the Sony image one directly so
as always yeah put them up
we can
I think wood here compared to the v20
the v80 is way too harsh way too much
trouble somehow
yeah maybe it becomes better if you put
it inside deeper but I don't manage they
always slip out so I would have to press
it inside but even then trailer is not
that great although all your budget says
an eargasm sound clarity that makes even
the dirtiest of track sound clean and
crisp well for me is just a boosted
treble so it's nothing that special I
would definitely take the v20 instead
which has a smooth response so maybe
let's compare the v-22 the NH one yes
mentioned it's a new recording so I
recorded it with a rather shallow
insertion but they should become
comparable like this anyhow so let's
have a listen again firstly 20 and then
Sony MH 1
see to me you are in my thoughts I never
stray from the heart of you
am i searching you I wanna feel
I think you could hear the Sony is a
little treasure it has this special
magic a very smooth response
yeah just let's have a look at the
frequency response measurements I will
first show you the Sony image one and
keep in mind this is diffuse field
target compensated uncompensated it
would look like the gray curve so
without the strong treble emphasis but
with some peak at 3 kilohertz instead
which is smaller than 80 resonance so
the diffuse field target tries to filter
out the eurozone ends but boost rail
instead this is not what I'm hearing in
reality still it should give us an idea
for a relative comparison therefore I
will overlay that here NV 80 here and
you can see it has way more treble in
the 10 kilohertz region also needs a
little bit wacky channel matching is not
that great as from the Sony if we
overlaid the TR NV 20 instead you can
see that it's a little bit smoother
without this strong treble peak also
meets appear a little bit more natural
but still I think the Sony image one has
a monitor response overall platform yeah
and I'm not that impressed the v20 is
quite okay it's no class leader or
something but it can be nice also has
some clarity you just have to really be
sure to have it deep inside I don't
quite manage so maybe I'm just not
compatible with it the sony is really
easy to put in just I use really the
larger tips put inside and it's taste
like this and I get crazy great sound
the sound changes a little bit if you
use the smaller tip then you need deeper
insertion but the sony definitely blows
both away it's not the most detailed
sound but it has very smooth overall
response with nice treble maybe it also
depends on your ear I'm especially quiet
quite disappointed with the TR NV 80s
because of the receiving yeah I expected
something more not just boost the treble
but a nicer response but I can hear the
trail over has been very very strange
characteristics base is similar on them
it just made I would say that this one
is definitely more natural and nicer
yeah as mentioned don't keep the samples
as 100% true I do my best
but with this assistant it's not that
possible John my my how do you my tutor
know he's currently back at home in
China so maybe he will organize some
coolers for me and I will try to repeat
and maybe get more consistent results
between different in is because I'm a I
noticed that some in is if I record them
they give me quite consistent results
while other models some completely off
to what I'm hearing it's not very it's
not a normed here just some short you
can also depending on how deep I insert
and the sound changes completely
yeah I hope you liked it for me you have
that your TR NV 20 is quite okay but
still metamodels around this AKG Samsung
z1 pH EKG is way nicer although I heard
some have problems with with getting it
inside the year so what you get I get
with this here because it doesn't stay
in my ear also hurts a little bit the
design here is too the edges are too too
hard too far I think it should be more
organic total yet to accommodate or to
to stick to the year yeah I hope you
like this and you can hear I'm still a
bit sick and see you in the next video
not sure if some other in your maybe
some speaker some surprises coming so
stay tuned have a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
