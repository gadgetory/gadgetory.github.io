some of you are already quite excited
just like me yesterday will compare the
brand-new JBL party box hundred then
mini party box against the classic pyro
excess nine let's call it may be vintage
become this only four years old so for
years for a Bluetooth speaker market is
quite an eternity but still within this
class there was not much competition
until the JBL now I don't want to talk
much I mean quite clear as to hear them
by myself we will create them to make
some therefore I came out as here I will
use my pen or microphones also my DJI
Osmo action as head him for this
immersive 3d sound and first-person view
you should have costly some headphones
put them up and let's check them out as
you can hear I selected a noisy location
this time for a more lifelike comparison
Bose speakers are playing with neutral
settings now so bass boost is disabled
for the parrot box and the I was playing
with EQ of volume is slightly above half
now and our staff of the JBL box hundred
so with these new cassette things the
type of pencil sound a bit boring so I
will turn on the first step of the bass
boost mode and you can hear it gets this
impressive bass kick which the Iowa
doesn't help so the first step boost's
lower base while there is the second
step which one are boost midbass let's
read this right so with dance music that
contains lots of lower bass kicks I
think it benefits from the first base
step
however start sounding a bit strange
haven't increased volume in a bit so we
are around 3/4 maybe
Valley walk so let's try the second base
step if you can serve it for me but if
any other music this can be an advantage
so here that is also a nice tie with
district
so I personally prefer it with the first
face mode out to us you get some nice
lower base and it's increased volume
again now track and maybe let's visit
maximum so this is the polygon with
maximum volume
as you can see this also maximum
anything it remains quite innocently so
the Iraqis law also Clara and has this
lower base
let's see how the some changes affect
this but it seems they also improved
sound dispersion compared to the old
party bolts or the party box 300
so the party box definitely way more fun
Sunday here yeah you can hear what we
could try is the other base mode again
it makes the sound more comfortable at
Illinois but still
that's why this track so with that kind
of music disco older old-school stuff
from the seventies where there is not
that much lower base
it's rather benefits from the second
base base boost mode premiere that I was
starts becoming quite lost
so if I switch to the first base mode
you will hear that
this is base off first base mode if you
don't get this lower peep
there's no chance here
so the party books definitely blows it
away especially at higher levels only
thing we could do is again a fly I was
tricked to boost all these events I
already prepared it so all the bands are
boosted to make some it should nigga I
got slightly louder so let's have a
listen again please in volume to make
some other party box compressional idea
which became indeed this is amazing and
please it sounds nicer than that
this is completely unimpressed Pacific
to play even far away yes I was trying
hard
so Donna slice this track not that much
different from the sound has no power is
better all
this basically the most impressive part
here and have some nice clarity to the
song
I mean the aisle is really frying that's
a good job part has no chance
anyway the mucosa puppets liability
quite a difference I would say I was met
with a small patience again
since there
potty books
manages to fill the space a bit better
with music
although my my slot that manager
what the face is just amazing here
I will try the second base step again
let's see if this changes something but
I personally prefer the first one it
really depends on the music mixing going
on even on track with second base mode
it sounds more fun
since lightly loaded for powerful but I
think for that kind of music which
contains those lower frequencies a
listen to this analysis
it starts to reduce bass and it fits at
pallidus while you still get this key so
you can hear me push miss and travel
more than base at a maximum button
I mean I was not bad really but it's a
four year old speaker so on
I mean they cause the same so if you
want some party if you want some
loudness and still keep it rather small
not to be I think that I box is
currently the top performer in this
class that is can you only meet by a
face so we would get the similar sound
with the second bass boost mode of the
hav on my glass is now it makes you I'm
sorry
Vox Wilson sniper having any compression
while you can hear a limiter or he's
struggling
we'll go far away as far as I can hey
pass the salt as windy but somehow
kicking the kicking party box
yeah this is way nicer way cleaner you
can hear every distinct attack base
amazing
I'm quite impressed I really why this is
some some mash some the base is melted
together lava slice quite similar both
let's try this I will reduce for him
again to something like yes 2/3 3/4
maybe so you can hear the difference in
base better maybe
Genesis I did it in my stomach
successfully it's not even a party box
key huh not had that kind of face
this is not something to be bumpy
we started to dance here let's release
track it's really nice
it resembles a some of the party box we
haven't but somehow more refined it
seems maybe not as loud not as powerful
and starting to become again a bit windy
I think you can hear the difference
just way more fun sounding way more
impressive so forget inclusive uncommon
on the Isle as well
that's retrying
I cannot offer you this impressive cake
so made for some special interests
maybe this I'm sure in Texas they would
particle that kind of music so let's
listen how it sounds with Nancy some
boxes along I don't know it sounds
strange against the party box especially
higher levels
this more air more space
the base is nicer the only thing again
we could try the second base boost mode
sorry for elites I'm hiding behind some
bush and using volume again to maximum
very difficult sorry
has more lead somehow yeah it's really
really really nice
and and I'm especially first some rock
break
this is what pays post-motor to
anybody for a bit scruffy
I would like to switch to bass most bass
boost mode one again not sure if it
makes any sense for that kind of music
and keep in mind it becomes again to 3
DB louder if you attach it to mains
and literature I mean this house
distorted on both the but that's the
kind of music
the thing I would say so yeah we have a
new master of boom boxes here yeah I
must confess I'm quite impressed and
really blown away by the new party box
hundred as there is no other portable
speaker up to three hundred dollars
which would offer you this party feeling
especially out to us with this heavy
bass and this loudness yeah this is what
the JBL boom box should have been from
the very beginning the party box is
larger heavier but it's cheaper at the
same time and it makes the JBL boom box
sound like some cheap toy it doesn't
sound great at low levels it passes on
great at high levels why this sounds
really nice and it also makes the Iowas
sound a bit dated although it doesn't
make the iris on bed
well here this may be in an obtained
video interest that the Iowa at normal
level still gives you a more refined
sound you can also find you knit a
better sound stage so the JBL party box
without extra bass into a sounds a
little an emmy it doesn't have any
loudness compensation with extra bass
again it sounds too booming and the
driver layoff is a bit strange so it has
a left and the right driver but it has
only two tweeter C on top it doesn't
have the third tweeter of the party box
300 so you could place it horizontally
and it switched the Twitter's so here if
you place it horizontally you will get
treble from the right side and still no
real left and right separation still I
think it's really great for what it is
for all those seeking some body boombox
for outdoors with battery I think this
is it
currently the king easily outperformed
the IRA and most others so it gets my
personal awards for a portable boombox
for summer 2019
as I don't think there will be much
better ones especially in this price
range so below 10 kilograms I think it
outperforms everything else currently
it's not the loudest pony so it was flat
in other than Iowa but it remains
totally controlled up to maximum with no
Distortion that bass is really amazing
so this is the selling point of the
party box this is Reed bass I think I
prefer it over the party box 300 facets
smaller lighter and still offers you
this nice salt I even think that the
overall tuning is slightly better on the
hundred compared to the 300 so for three
hundred dollars and no brainer for all
those who need it although as an
all-rounder the Iowa is probably still
the better choice but I mean you could
hear this
amazing so not quite true what kind of
trickery JBL is applying here because
the base is really it's some effect but
you need this for dense music for
hip-hop so all youngsters would probably
love it and forget the GBO boombox
for all those asking me not even
comparing this completely blows it away
the JBL boombox at Adams becomes some
sizzling toy but this you could hear it
also uses bass lightly despite the bass
boost mode but it remains very very
meaty and the bass really no distortion
no farting and it also becomes louder
when AC powered it's a pity that JBL
doesn't include any power mode so that
it could also play with full power full
loudness from battery of course we've
reduced battery life then it would be
killer from AC power it still sounds
powerful more powerful so with two three
DB more and also a heavier bass but for
what it is I still think it's great and
kudos to JBL for releasing this there
will not be much competition for all
those who have some powerful joyful
booms to excel this completely blows it
away it's maybe at normal levels
no as I don't think it's a speaker meant
to be placed somewhere at home it's
meant to be taken out into the car then
do some party and I think and look at
you I think it supports their appearing
with a lot with another one so two four
six hard Alice must do an amazing job
and and I'm really I'm quite impressed
and I'm pretty sure most others will
will be too but the eyebrow remains and
nice around our for three hundred
dollars but doesn't have any chance
against the party box hang out if you
need some real heavy bass and high
loudness still it would be nice to have
it even louder so it can compete against
speakers like the sound box or those
Sony crap they are louder but sound just
this is junk this sounds really nice not
perfectly refined but you could hear
it's really okay and forward it for what
it is it's currently I think the top
performer I hope this video could give
you a fair idea about the sound about
the performance of the GB about party
box hundreds I will try to prepare
another video indoors to show you how it
sounds at normal levels until then stay
tuned
and for those interested to give you
some felt idea about the power and
loudness of the GBA party box hundred
especially compared against more compact
boom boxes like that toy box across
which already blew away the GBA extreme
- let's listen to this the party box is
playing slightly above half with bass
mode one like if I compare
Oh miss miss what happens if you
increase volume
this makes feeding for the party
the other part is not as well
so now you know if it makes sense to
carry around 10 kilograms instead of two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
