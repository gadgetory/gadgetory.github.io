Today I would like to give you a direct sound comparison of the the new Teufel Boomster NG and the even newer JBL Xtreme 2
Some may say the Xtreme 2 is a she, I think it is a he.
No idea if speakers are male or female in reality
But some of you may remember around 3 years ago I was sitting exactly here and presented both side by side
That video still seems to be quite popular as I am still getting comments, but it is not up to date anymore.
Therefore I wanted to make a new video as both units were released in a new generation
Some months ago Teufel released the new Boomster NG
JBL the Xtreme 2
and while the old Xtreme could still more or less keep up with the old Boomster
maybe not so much in sound but more in overall loudness
this was also my biggest point of criticism for Teufel, that the Boomster was not loud enough
it seemed as if it have played twice as loud
and this was finally corrected with the new version
it is really pretty loud
although it reduces bass at high levels quite a lot
but it is nearly as loud as the JBL Boombox, not being as bassheavy
but sounding much better overall
The Xtreme 2 on the other hand is considerable softer than the old version
thus much softer than the Teufel Boomster at the same time
and although sounding better than the old version, I would say it sounds more mature
but only up to half volume
above half volume you can notice how it loses power, bass is getting reduced
it starts sounding quite metallic
and it cannot play really loud, above 3/4 there is hardly any change in loudness anymore
but price wise both are quite comparable, also regarding functionality
the Teufel has also a radio built in, even an additional digital radio
it also has a swappable battery
this means if the rechargeable battery is empty, you could even insert normal batteries instead.
and above all the rechargeable battery is quite decent, at maximum volume I managed more than 5 hours, while being much louder than the Xtreme 2
I thought we are going to have a listen to both, I would like to demonstrate how the sound compares between them
for those who didn't know it yet, you can also compare them through my database
this is a database where I included recordings of all speakers that I had at home
the recordings are binaural, so you have to listen through headphones and you can compare the Xtreme 2 to the Teufel, the Teufel to the JBL Boombox and so on
I like the sound of the Teufel quite a lot
also the JBL Xtreme 2 is really decent, even a bit more sparkling up to half volume
but above that there is not much
first we will go inside and listen to both at normal levels like up to half volume
later we will go outside, turn them to maximum as outdoors you can hear the difference in loudness more easily
as always please use headphones as this is a binaural recording
let's get inside and take a listen
volume on both is at around half, this is also the sweet spot of the JBL
at half volume it simply sounds best
the subwoofer is set to neutral now and let's start with it immediately
the JBL
the JBL sounds even fuller, therefore I like to turn the sub to +3dB
this also makes the sound more balanced which results in a consistent smiley response
so it also becomes more comparable to the JBL
with bass at 0dB there is some bass missing compared to the treble which is raised quite a bit
but you can hear, also mids are more pronounced here
let's try something else
the JBL on the other hand plays with a bit more sparkle, here upper treble is more pronounded
depending on the recording this can be an advantage or disadvantage
but I would have claimed, that the Teufel plays a bit more mature
another track
it's quite remarkable that the smaller speaker can keep up that well here, at least up to half volume
it sounds nearly just as good
but we will hear later on that the Teufel can in fact play deeper, but you won't hear this will all tracks
you have to play tracks which still have some lower bass below 50hz
but I think you can hear, that the bass here is simply.... yeah, deeper!
but here the highs again, which give the sound some additional brillance
I really like it a lot, at moderate levels only though
something else
here you should hear the difference, if you listen to the bassdrum
although it is pretty close
but you will notice that the bass is not that boosted but rather deeper with more power
here it is a bit more boomy
of course I could boost bass even more but yeah...
here you should hear it well
especially the lowest bass note here, which is an F sharp I guess
this F sharp this should be around 46Hz
the Teufel plays this really clean
and the JBL
I think you cannot hear it that well as I am probably sitting in a negative room mode here, so I'll stand up
Teufel again
yes, here you can hear it well, this F sharp is really very nice
the JBL again
it is rather only harmonics, the fundamental is not played at all
these are as mentioned around 46Hz
although you can also hear that it has better dispersion to the sides above
here the tweeters are maybe a bit hidden
I will sit a bit more centered, and let's try this
it's from the current album from Soulpersona and Princess Freesia 'Sunset City&quot;
the JBL
has some nice kick
but as soon as I increase volume a little bit
you can hear, it has already lost a bit
and the Teufel here
there is simply no bass anymore
it almost starts to scream, but I would suggest to listen to them outdoors
also at maximum to hear how it sounds outdoors
so I will start with the Teufel again, bass is set to +4dB now and volume around half, not sure if you can see it, and another track from Soulpersona and Princess Freesia
the JBL
you can hear it sounds a little bit metallic, it plays at around 2/3 and you can notice that it already sounds thinner
until half it is OK, but above that the sound becomes too thin
and I will increase the volume a bit
sounds still OK
the JBL
and yeah, it becomes thinner and thinner
and if I increase volume even more
I'll go farther away and maximum
the JBL
also at maximum, and nothing happens anymore
neither does it become any louder
it is indeed a difference
I'll try something else
and I can go away even farther while still hearing it well
the JBL
yeah, now it starts sounding completely lost
it becomes even softer, you can hear the limiter is fighting quite a lot
but it is not comparison anymore
I will listen a bit more off axis
both have tweeters so should disperse the sound to the sides nicely as well
but the JBL sounds really ridiculous
something else
I will go a bit farther away again
yeah, with the Teufel here, you can nearly have some party at this sports field here
and the JBL...
it becomes something like a kitchen radio
this is really maximum, I don't fake anything here
you can see it doesn't become any louder up from here
and it is fighting quite a lot, with titles like this where you have lots of loud mids,
you can hear how the limiter is pushing down loudness all the time
I think you can hear this
the Teufel
twice as loud I would have said
it is nearly as loud as the JBL Boombox although still much smaller and lighter
they are not comparable anymore
the JBL sounds just ridiculous now
I mean I can come closer here 3-4 meters
another track, I will go back again not to blow our ears
the church bell joins in as well
yeah... of course nice that both do not distort at maximum volume
but the JBL is not loud at all, for outdoors it is hardly usable I would have said
also because it becomes too thin above half volume
also the Teufel becomes thinner, but at the same time it is much louder
something else
here I can go farther away again
JBL
yeah... what shall I say?
as good as it sounds up to half
above that there is nothing left anymore
you can forget it
I am maybe 5-6 meters away, and you can hardly hear it
the Teufel
the difference is more than obvious
as shown, this is really maximum, it doesn't play any louder
something else, for our rock-fans maybe
and again, there is nothing left
I can come closer
this is maximum volume
it's indeed a huge difference
I think you could hear it well, the Teufel Boomster NG is a completely different beast
loudness wise the JBLXtreme 2 had no chance at all
both were not even comparable
although indoors up to half it sounds really great
it can even keep up with this larger speaker here
but as soon as you increase volume a little, bass gets lost
it also starts to pump pretty quickly thanks to this strange limiter
so for outdoors, for what it is meant for thanks to this sturdy and waterproof design etc.
it is completely unusable
loudness is lacking
it has no real power, even the old one is better in this regard
although against the new Boomster NG it doesn't have any chance either
Teufel really has improved and refined the original Boomster
while JBL managed to correct the sound, because the old Xtreme sounded a bit awkward
but loudness wise simply unsuable for outdoor use
I hope this video could give you a nice comparison
also regarding the new versions
I think you cannot even buy the old Boomster anymore
so for festivals outdoors etc, the Boomster NG is the much better choice
also price wise, currently I think available for 250€
then you add this boombag, so that it is more rugged and protected for outdoor use
and battery life is also great
at maximum more than 5 hours
I haven't tested the JBL yet, but the old one also managed something like 5:15h
so the new one should manage this as well, simply because it is softer now
I hope you liked it, and see you in the next video
many thanks for watchin, bye bye!</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
