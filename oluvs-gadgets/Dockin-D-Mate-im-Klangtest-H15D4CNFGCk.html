some of you can maybe remember that I already unboxed it together with my son sime time ago
we had a short listen and telling the truth the disappointment was quite big
so I put it away and completely forgot about it as in my case the very first impression counts most
but in the meantime I have read some reviews like this from Lowbeats here and they seem quite impressed
they award it 4.4 points out of five, also their conclusion is nice to read:
high maximum volume, bass adjustable in 2 steps, a well rounded tuning with great timing and decent dynamics
the only negative point: a bit flat with vocals
when looking on amazon it's the same story: all reviews mostly positive
&quot;top speaker with minor flaw&quot;
&quot;meets all expectations&quot;
&quot;much allaround sound for little money&quot;
&quot;tip top&quot;
&quot;cannot be any better&quot;
&quot;outstanding bluetooth speaker&quot;
blah blah blah...
so I had a listen again, did some comparisons back and forth, but I am really not able to relate to this
maybe my hearing is bad, I am not sure
it reminds me of a UE Megaboom, but somehow worse
I already coudln't start up with the UE Megaboom
the Dockin D Mate is similarly built and should offer omnidirectional sound
the drivers aim to the sides, so depending how you turn it it either sounds better or worse
particularly if you know the Dockin D Fine which definitely belongs to the top products within its class
which also manages to outclass the JBL Xtreme easily which is even more expensive
the expectations for a successor model become quite high
you can see size wise the differences are not that huge, it's also just a 40€ difference in price
but I really cannot quite follow, I cannot account for all this as I really think it's bad
and for a comparison I selected a new product here
yeah I cannot show it yet, the manufacturer asked me not to show it, it will be released to the market in August now
it should cost around 60-70$, thus quite a bit cheaper
you can see it's also smaller, feature-wise exactly the same,
it also has stereo wireless pairing like the Dockin D Mate, it's completely waterproof
but sounds way better
but I have to mention that I assisted a little bit. they had sent me a sample in advance
I had a listen and told them, it doesn't sound great, you need to improve more
one week later I got a new firmware from them, I could easily update it on my own
it already sounded way better, but there was still some peak which I asked them to reduce, also boost bass a bit here, take a bit away from there
3 days later again a new firmware asking me if this can be final
I told them: yes
quite amazing that some companies really listen to an amateurish opinion like from me
and now I think it sounds really great
of course later I will reveal what exactly this was when it comes to the market, now I cannot tell you
I will just name it with some question marks
and we will compare these 2
but there is also the Sony XB30
I think in the meantime you can already get it below 80€
although it is not an omnidirectional speaker, it also sounds much better
also has the same features like stereo pairing
also a kind of party mode where you can pair it with an XB20 and so on
it also has these funny lights
but what it misses is, that it's indeed a bit directional, so those omnidirectional speakers definitely are better in this regard
you can of course already listen to it from my database
and you can hear it simply doesn't sound good, regardless if with this bass mode or without
it doesn't sound right and you never know if you should aim it towards you or listen from front
I recorded it from front, how you would usually listen
although I think it sounds a bit better from the side
I also tried measuring it, here with the measuring microphone aimed directly at the drivers
and you can see this is some up and down, such a response is unacceptable
particularly the upper bass area around 200hz is much too pronounced
while there is not much below 100hz
if you switch on this extra bass this peak becomes even higher
this results in more than 12dB boost in the 200hz region
although I usually say that a bassboost above 100hz is not supposed to be there
everything should happen below 100hz
there is some response at around 80hz, but above is just way too much
then there is again something missing in the lower treble, while upper treble has some peak at 11-12khz
overall the frequency response is totally off
it also changes depending on how you turn the speaker
yeah, and I thought we will listen together
as always I will wear my headcam and my binaural microphones
of course you have to listen with headphones, this is the most important premise for binaural recordings
so please put up your headphones and let's have a listen
first I will turn it on, the status tones are already known from the Dockin D Fine
and immediately some music
volume is synced with iphone and speaker
but the Dockin D Mate cannot play really softly
this is the first volume step, it doesn't go any lower
if I turn down volume even more you get this tone
I want to listen to music softly but get annoyed by such a loud tone
I really don't know what went wrong in the development department
the speaker should offer 360° sound
you can hear, there is something playing out of here, and out of here
but from front it becomes a bit muddy
then it also has this bass mode, which we will add now
but then everything starts to drone
doesn't really sound great
but let's try it against this,... I will simply call it prototype
and let's check which one sounds better
this also has 360° sound
it's in fact the same, but you can hear...
the difference is huge
I am not quite sure if it won't sound better without bass
but then the sound becomes too thin
so I will simply play it with bass, in order to make it more comparable to the others
otherwise it will sound like nothing
but you can hear it is just some droning
maybe something else
you can hear some real lower bass here, although it is half the size
I think everyone can hear this, something is not right here, I mean this is not a sound I can take seriously
you can here some bass, treble, also mids are alright
I tried tuning it in such a way that it sounds acceptable from all angles
not too piercing, not too muffled
but here, something went wrong obviously
something else
this is something completely different
let's listen also from here, if it becomes better like that
from the side treble becomes a bit better, but anyhow you can hear
it's not really great
another track
loudness wise the small one cannot keep up of course, so I will turn it up
the Dockin D Mate
louder indeed, but...
nevertheless it sounds worse, it is a....
it's a...
in English I would have said: &quot;a mess&quot;
thus a chaos
let's try something else
and I will turn it to maximum again
you can hear it can play loud, but...
here the small one becomes pretty lost
but it still sounds better
I mean, I wouldn't like to listen to music like this
let's try something else
maybe this here
I will maybe try to match both, so the small one plays at maximum now
the Dockin D mate a bit below
here you can also hear some limiting
it had to be done, as the small drivers cannot do more
but this here is unacceptable
so let's try the Sony XB30 now
it is also cheaper, in the meantime I think available below 80€
and we will save us the Dockin D Fine
everyone who wants to compare both tries my database
and let's listen to these 2, I mean I like the sony although it also gives a muffled impression
especially if you don't sit exactly on axis
otherwise it sounds quite convincing
let's try this track
I will try to reach a higher loudness again
the Sony
it has to sound like that
we are already hearing with bass, I will turn it off for now
yeah...
those who find this sound great... I am not sure
maybe my ears are damaged
I am not sure now to tell the truth, I cannot be the only one who finds this weird sounding
let's try this
also sounds a bit strange
the Sony
I think it won't even sound much worse from behind than the Dockin, although it is quite directional
you can hear, even from behind quite OK
sure, it's a bit better now with treble
it's not an omnidirectional speaker, so you have to sit in front to get the best sound
but then it also sounds good
I'll try this
also sounds way more convincing
I will again go a bit farther away and turn both to slightly higher levels
this is the Sony
it plays at around 3/4
sounds still OK I would have said
the Dockin
I'll go farther away and turn both to maximum
this is the Dockin
Sony
to tell the truth, I am not sure which one is louder now, but the Sony still sounds normal
it is almost a bit louder,  but you can hear, it is again such..
mess
a.... a... how do you say?
Sony
no, no, no, this is a mush, a sound mush
not really listenable
I played around with an EQ a bit
if you can get something more out of it, if you can rescue it a bit
turth to be told, it's really hard
where do I have my equalizer app?
all are always asking, it is simply a parametric equalizer
I personally use EQ10
and I have prepared an equalizer curve
it looks quite wild, but it needs this, because there is so much failed
I take a look, without EQ
a track from Soulpersona and Princess Freesia
I like to use them often, because all frequencies are always represented well
I'll turn it up
this is without EQ now
maybe this volume level
and then I will turn on the equalizer and you will hear if it sounds more normal or not
now with EQ
it's not perfect but you can hear it sounds considerably more normal now
again without
yeah
does everyone hear this?
again with
now I won't say anything, you simply watch my thumb
this is now with EQ
so what did I do here?
first I reduced this strange 200hz boost
then at 2-3khz it also has some weird bump which makes the sound quite hollow
generally it lacks treble overall, this means I boosted everything starting at 5khz with a high shelf
and at the same time reducing this strange peak at 10-11khz
I think in my case it is even at 12khz
completely with a narrowband notch filter
and then it sounds acceptable
although bass is already now a bit uncontrolled
this is with EQ now
but like this it sounds....
to forget
there would be some potential... and this tone!
which comes everytime when you turn volume down
also this completely unacceptable
what we could also try is this stereo pairing which I didn't quite manage after my unboxing
so we will turn on this one too
and this is the actual pairing button
ah, they already connected to each other, really nice!
and let's try another track, what do we have here? maybe this here
oaahhhh, what the f... was this?
help!
wait a minute
oh my god, this scared the hell out of me
even the recording was distorted
now we have them in stereo
unfortunately this doesn't make the sound any better
we could also try how something like that sounds against the Dockin D Fine
I'll stop the music, not that it also starts scraming, no idea at which loudness level I left it
that's true, this one has completely different tones, she is blabbing here
I think the new one doesn't blab like that
I'll turn it to maximum
I mean, these are 200€, and this 140. Let's see which one sounds more convincing
I think in this case I'd rather do without stereo and take something like this!
telling the truth, I have no idea what to say to this
it can make some noise, can play quite loud but also starts to distort then
for really listening to music it's not suitable
especially this droning upper bass, this doesn't even sound good outdoors
sure you need more bass outdoors, so that the sound can unfold
but other companies have understood this better like JBL with the Xtreme
they rather boost the 70-80hz area
it's really kicking then, you can still hear it from 50m away
also Sony with the XB30, they rather boost the lower bass
with the XB3, the predecessor it was also such a strange 200hz droning
and here neither mids nor treble match
it does not fit at all
maybe I am hearing wrong, I don't know
but I cannot follow all these positive ratings here
in fact it's loud, maybe this is the only important factor nowadays:
loud, loud, much noise
I am not sure, but it isn't sound for my ears
and for 100€ you can get much better, even if it looks quite nice
add 40€ more and get the Dockin D Fine
my hope was, that this would be at least some downscaled version
but it's far away, not even comparable
this little bogey speaker here also outclasses it, although it cannot play that loud
but instead it can be used for serious music listening
I can put it here, or outdoros on the floor
although not suitable for a party, but it simply sounds decent
listen again through my database and you will hear that even a UE Megaboom sounds better
it's not even much larger, no... I think it is even smaller than this
yeah, I hope you liked this video
but I cannot give a positive rating
I am really disappointed here
with some additional equalizing there could be squeezed a bit more out of it maybe
but it already plays now so uncontrolled with bass
even when I take down this upper bass you can hear some strange droning, scratching, I don't know
some things went wrong here
also that it cannot really play softly, those strange tones,.... no!
maybe there will be a firmware update, who knows
of course quality is nice
the material sensation, it's also water proof etc, this is nice, but...
the sound is completely off
again thanks for watching, and see you in the next video
