yes
did you play with Julian again?
yes
and were you also outside in the garden?
yes
really?
and what did you do?
we played
played?
did you also drive with the go-cart?
yes
fine
wow, looks what is standing here
man, what did they send us here?
look, I think they look like this
Audio Pro
we have them already
but not that big
do we want to open it immediately?
you know what? get inside, greet mum, wash your hands and I will bring it inside and we can open it right away
so, let's carry it inside
but it is not that heavy as usual, look neither as huge as the others
come here, let's listen to them
get over there, I will replace them
and what do you say?
doesn't sound that good
which ones do not sound good?
these
and these?
exactly the same
which song do you like that much? come here!
no, the other one
we will listen to it later
get over again
which song is this?
hip hop
is this the other one?
but cannot you play the other one?
we listen to this now
which one has better bass?
this
here is yours
now you must listen close which one sounds better
these
these sound better
what? don't you like this music?
I am waitig for the other one
we will also listen to that
wait, I want to hear this again
could you bring me that remote control, this puck from the Teufel speakers?
let's connect to those too, OK?
look you can change this, that is bluetooth
I am connected
sit over there, so that the people can hear this
and what do you say?
which ones are playing now?
the big ones here
the Teufel sound better!
really?
because they have so much bass
but much bass doesn't mean they sound better, look how nice these sound
look how much bass
but this doesn't sound good anymore
here the sofa vibrates
come on, get over here, say bye bye as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
