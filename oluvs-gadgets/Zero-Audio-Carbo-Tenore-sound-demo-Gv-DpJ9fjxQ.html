audio care about he no no car the bottom
or a/c Lupron chamois common little
eonni this is a Japanese in here that
you can get below fifty dollars and
according to this packaging it won some
prizes 2013-14 summer 2015 2016 not sure
what kind of prices everything is
written in Japanese here yeah and it's
made out of carbon single driver design
dynamic driver and I think it's actually
not that bad
although yeah it's not perfect either
yeah when I heard it the first time I
thought it was a bit grainy so travel is
too much and the travel rendering is
just not right so I started again to
experiment with different tips and
somehow although usually I don't like
foamies I think it sounds smoother with
foam is they bring down this travel to
some normal level also get rid of some
Peaks so if you put it deep inside it
becomes quite nice a little bit more
bass with the forest and with V with the
normal silicon tips comes with three
pairs with yep standard sized ones with
tiny ones and with gigantic ones these
are really huge I think these are the
largest silicon tips I've ever seen and
the smaller ones are quite tiny so maybe
for a baby
so really all three sizes lots of space
between them and first I would like to
show you how the sound changes from the
stock tips over to the foamies but keep
in mind yeah this is a rough
representation so they sound smooth and
reality then from the recording but it
should give you an idea what changes if
you change the tips from the normal
silicon tips to for me so first their
original stock tips then the form is and
the variant the original tracks so you
have a reference how it should sound
is it just a treat my loving me inside
my fantasy to me you are in my thoughts
I never stray from the part of you
we can
am i touching you I wanna feel
I think we'll deal with the stock tips
travel is a little bit much also it has
some graininess to it this improves with
the form is but it's still not perfect
although with performace I can enjoy it
quite a bit
while with the stock tips they appear
too harsh to me looking at some
measurements here black other stock tips
in gray performies you can see that the
form is somehow shift overall treble get
rid of this upper treble peak but
enhance the peak at around 7 8 kilohertz
even more so it's not perfect but I
think it still sounds ok so now I would
like to let you listen to the carbon
Canora Carentan or with the 4 mese
compared to the final audio if mm that
we had last time this is playing with
the sony hybrid tips as I think it
sounds much better and more sparkling
although still likes a little bit of
sparkle
so first the care button or then the
final audio III thousand and again at
the very end the origin track so you
know how it should sound in reality
to me you are in my thoughts I never
stray from the heart of you
am i searching you I wanna feel
I think it's quite okay it's not the
best in year I've ever heard but yeah
there are much worse ones for this price
so below fifty dollars there is so much
junk the carotene or is quite okay
especially base is not too elevated it
has a nice amount of base but not too
boo me my problem is this trail
rendering is just not perfect but it's
still quite okay especially if you
compare it to all this junk that many
praised which is just horrible
even the teen audio t2 sounds much worse
than this and although is even flatter
with bass so these are quite nice my
personal issue is try rendering is a
little bit grainy a little bit it has
some strange character to it but it's
still exact acceptable so yeah if you
want to try it out for below 50 does not
that bad actually I saw there are some
great reviews and you hate cut some
awards some prizes here so still I think
it could be better
I definitely prefer the final audio
smoother overall mmm
has a more natural sound that they are
quite okay so no complaints here yeah
this was it for the carpet in order the
only thing I could show you again is a
comparison of the final audio e 3000
here so I will overlay it in green and
you can see it has more upper base in
the 200 Hertz region bass rolls off in
the lower region and it doesn't have
these peaks at seven kilohertz
yeah and treble could be definitely a
bit more pronounced so to a similar
level as the caribou Tino with the foam
is so at around what what is he 12 13
kilo Hertz could be definitely some fact
DB more apart from that yeah I like them
a lot but the cotton or cotton or a are
not that bad either so yeah you could
try it out if you need something decent
sounding definitely nicer than all those
K set a new weather because I don't even
know how to pronounce it some some book
who is that I know way better I'm not
quite sure what the hype around this GFI
stuff is especially this bad one so yeah
this was it thanks all for watching and
see you next video bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
