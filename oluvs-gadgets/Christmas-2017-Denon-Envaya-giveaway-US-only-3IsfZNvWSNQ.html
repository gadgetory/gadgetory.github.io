yeah first let me say thanks for all
those kind comments I also got some
really nice emails from people I don't
even know so thanks so much this means a
lot to me it's such a nice calm time now
so let's forget all the hate but I have
some good and bad news for you not sure
if I should start with that good or bad
one so let's start with the good news in
Sunday's it's Christmas so let's enjoy
the time together but the bad news is
that the denon in via who won't be
released in the u.s. yeah I guess then
on when it will come to the US because
many have asked as well and they told me
that they don't have any plans to
release it for the u.s. not sure why
yeah and I feel really sad and it's a
pity but you won't be able to buy it in
America mm yeah I'm really sorry it's
one of the best I've heard in this class
if not the best finally that we have a
speaker with a really serious sound yeah
you cannot buy it maybe through some
import I saw some dealers on Amazon who
offer it from Japan for I think $440
this is quite steep so you could maybe
try buying it from Europe or something
yeah but I have another good news for
you I have one unit to give away to my
u.s. viewers yes yeah you cannot buy it
in the US I want to give it away to one
of you why us
yeah also I have viewers from the USA as
a major part so 20% of you are from the
US followed by Germany which is I think
13 percent and then UK with 5 percent
maybe so the major part of my viewers
are from the US and I really appreciate
this because of my strange language -
French accent you are still watching my
videos or you are hating them I'm not
sure but I asked Danone if I could get a
unit from them to give it away to one of
you and I want to do this in a kind of
raffle I also want to thank denim for
this nice jest can you say it like this
for this nice nice
gift let's say and to make it a little
bit more funny maybe and not simply pick
some random guy I want to I want to know
from you which speaker was featured in
most of my videos from 2017 so which one
appeared most often let's say yeah and
don't send or don't write a comment
because you otherwise you will influence
each other rather send me a message
through YouTube how to send me a message
here simply click on my profile then go
to channel info then you have this
message button click on this and send me
a message with some I don't know
Christmas giveaway 2017 and the right
answer and then at the end after
Christmas let's say we will do a raffle
and pick one of you but if we have some
really heavy geek some fan if we find
someone who knows also in how many
videos the speaker was featured with
Sean I talked about it I mean it was
present let's say then this guy will win
it immediately yeah I think it's fair
because otherwise someone who yeah who
doesn't watch my videos at all he will
get it I really want someone who one of
my loyal followers one who really
watches all my videos and so on and of
course you have to be a subscriber of my
channel the other premise is that you
have to be a u.s. resident I cannot send
it to I don't know to Brazil to
Australia or you know Singapore I think
you can bite there any also you can bite
in Hong Kong some bodies in Hong Kong I
think but in the US there is no way so
therefore this is the only thing I can
offer you is a little giveaway is a
thank you for your support for your
I don't know for your yeah simply that
I'm here because of you I make this for
you and I also want to give you
something back also thanks to denim for
offering me this unit I mean this is
mine they will send me a new one
it will probably arrive after Christmas
so you will get it next year but still
please regard this as some kind of
Christmas present for you yeah I think
this was it
again thanks to all my my lawyer loyal
followers my loyal viewers yeah I only
do this I had some really tough time now
because of their strange comments I did
this stupid fun videos with base tests
which were which were not non men non
not men seriously and they sadly got
crazy views while my let's say my
serious videos yeah don't get any
attention so I thought I mean why why am
i doing all this I saw some other
YouTube channels with base tests that
cut millions of views when my most
popular video doesn't even reach 1
million so 700,000 an old video about
the JBL extreme so I'm really a little
bit this was I have I had a tough time
as I thought I could maybe do this
YouTube everything a little bit for
living then I thought I won't manage
simply I cannot I may be mine either I'm
too bad in what I'm doing or maybe yeah
it's too small Nisha maybe who is
interesting Pluto's because at all and
if then they are satisfied with the UE
boom or something that they get yeah in
any advertisement but not someone who
really wants to listen to music so just
wanted to clear this up also wish you a
Merry Christmas and I hope yeah you
appreciate this little present also
thanks and on then on again for the non
two then on thanks to then on sorry
yeah my English is pretty bad sorry I
never really learned it correctly just
at school and I always had bad marks so
I always was close to F yes still really
thanks a lot for all those nice nice
comments that helped me yeah
get a little bit back onto onto track
let's say and I don't try to continue as
good as I can but yeah maybe there will
be some pause simply to also talk to ya
spend some time with our family so I
have some other applications especially
in January I will be very occupied for
maybe two months so yeah be patient and
thanks again I wish you a Merry
Christmas Happy New Year in case we
don't see or you don't see me I don't
see you
anyhow a very nice time for you your
family and everyone every everyone you
love and so on and see you in the next
year thanks a lot and bye-bye
