the loudness test or the new songbook
spoon to the extreme maybe remember
produce ago I hit the Iowa XS nine
standing here I went away 500 meters and
we could still hear it slightly the next
year with the total boom so excel we had
no luck although louder we couldn't hear
it from 600 meters away also because of
a nearby tractor but this is way louder
way more powerful than both of these so
I would like to test if it would be
horrible from one kilometer or thousand
meters away twice the distance that
we've heard the Iowa sound box claims it
which is 122 decibels from a long meter
away according to some acoustic rule you
get 60 B reduction with double the
distance so from 2 meters away we would
already get 116 dB at 4 meters 110 dB
so at thousand 24 meters it would be 60
DB less so end result 62 DB I'm not sure
if this will be renewable depending on
the ambient noise also depending on the
wind but I would like to try it out I
will go over there over the hill which
according to Google Earth is exactly 1
kilometer and we will listen from there
I will of course use my burner
microphones so you should listen with
headphones and use the loudness of my
voice is a rough guide to know how loud
it release and not sure it will be here
able at all but we'll try it out I will
ask my wife to play some music let's
crank it to maximum and let's go
I'm standing here thousand meters away
at the end of the forest I also brought
my main camera so we can zoom in a
little bit better I will call my wife
and she should play some music not sure
if it will really work I hope so but
conditions are not perfect
hello darling please play some music wow
wow it's louder than I expected
but you can hear how they wind moves the
sound around so it's definitely hear
about from one kilometer away
it's quite impressive
Wow I am really quite impressed one
kilometre if the wind wasn't there
you'll definitely get better as it moves
around slightly so I would say the test
succeeded let's turn it down immediately
yes this thing is dangerous it's really
a kind of sound weapon we could hear it
from one kilometer away although the
sound moved a little but during some
part it was real loud if there was no
wind it would have been even louder
definitely way louder than the IVA from
out the distance so we could call this
maybe a mobile discotheque and the best
thing I measured the battery life at
this level at maximum without a mode at
four hours forty so you get this
loudness for more than four hours close
to five hours which is really quite
impressive I'm not quite sure if it
really measures with 122 dirty bells
from one meter we will do this maybe in
another video but yeah it was loud
enough to be heard from one kilometer
away the conditions were not perfect
today but yeah still I'm really quite
impressed I hope you like this a little
and stay tuned for another test have a
nice diamond bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
