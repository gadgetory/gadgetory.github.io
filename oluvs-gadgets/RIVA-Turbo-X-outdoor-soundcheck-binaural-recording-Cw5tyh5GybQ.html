peaceful place here well it's perfect
for making some noise and blaring or
tunes for portable speakers I have the
Reba turbo X the Infinity one and the
JBL charge tool you maybe already heard
my first quick sound check of the river
turbo X where I compared it against the
infinity one unfortunately
I noticed a bit later that it didn't
play at maximum volume because every
time I switch between two different
sound targets it reduces the volume by
one step so it was never playing at full
volume compared to the Infinity
therefore I came outdoors this time so
that we can see how loud all the
speakers can play some asked me if I
could include the JBL charge tool this
is what I'm doing now so I will put up
my head cam my binaural microphones and
then let's have a listen okay let's
start with the Riva turbo X and the JBL
charge to first on both are playing at
their maximum volume with the turbo mode
disabled for the river I'm starting with
the river
okay now let's turn on turbo
respectfully Jael
let's store something else
this is the JBL
and the trouble again
okay I think it doesn't make quite sense
to continue further now let's try the
infinity instead also played at maximum
volume with the river turbo mode enabled
I'm starting with the river tracks
you can infinity
let's try another track with the river
playing the infinity
the Riva is also kept on behind why the
Infinity uses all the trouble let's try
something else
this is the infinity maximum volume
another River
okay this is the limit how far the
Bluetooth reaches on the Infinity let's
try the rewrite in okay it's not
comparison let's try another track some
rock this is the river I'm standing
maybe eight nine ten meters away
infinity
let's see if I can get a bit father and
three Reagan
I think it was pretty clear which one
was louder which one had fuller sound at
maximum volume there is some slight
distortion on top volume on the river
turbo X but it doesn't reduce bass in
any way while most other portable
speakers like the infinity one the
Soundlink 3 even the mega boom dial bass
back nearly completely while the river
still sounds the same at low and at
maximum volume with some slight
distortion added you can go down one
notch it's still louder than the
infinity but the distortion will be gone
the JBL charge 2 is well it's smaller
it's also cheaper but it doesn't quite
come close to both these speakers
especially not the Riva I hope to be
able to do some other tests also at
lower levels so stay tuned for more
until then bye bye
have a nice time with lots of Sun ok
just for completeness I thought I'll
test how far I can go away before both
speakers break up their Bluetooth
connection completely I'm starting with
the infinity one first
stay
infinity
okay that's the infinity it's not
durable anymore let's try the river Oh
Sees of steel connection
okay both and here we have maybe 3040
meters away</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
