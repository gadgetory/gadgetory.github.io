that some time ago
I already did an unboxing of the Celia
and para p4 speaker in the meantime I
got an updated version which sounds a
little bit better and I thought I would
like to demonstrate you of the sound as
always I'm using my binaural microphones
and the head cam to give you a kind of
first-person impression so please put up
your headphones as binaural recordings
only work well through headphones I
still get messages like well I'm
listening to this through my JBL extreme
and so on but well this is fail because
binaural recordings really require
headphones for best results so let's
have a look the special of the p4 is I
think it's on stage it has some kind of
theater processing haasil and para calls
it and it has the Twitter's at the sides
this is a bit uncommon but this really
manages to give the speaker extreme
sound dispersion to the sides and you
get a very broad stereo separation but
as the tweeters are the sides it might
appear a bit diffuser than the speakers
with Twitter's directly to the listener
so compared directly to other speakers
you will maybe get the impression as if
the Sirian para p4 sounds a little bit
covered for what else to to see here
well we have the be seen this uses a
similar charger to the GBA extreme I
also used it with the JBL extreme
charger this is charging out auxiliary
input volume buttons and power button
let's turn it on and let's have a listen
to a first track from soul persona
I can I think you can hear the roads
auto-painting
works really well so you really get a
nice sound stage but treble of course
would become better if I if I sit here
you can hear it the other problem is
changing volume results in these well
bit annoying tones and this is the
lowest volume step of the speaker with
an iPhone the volume is in sync between
speaker and player so you cannot get any
softer than this and I think this might
be a bit pull out for background
listening not at the same time
it can also play pretty loud I will put
it far away later on and we will crank
it to the maximum to see how it compares
maybe against the JBL extreme or
something to demonstrate you the stare
effect even better I thought I'll play
the classic from Pink Floyd money which
has lots of extreme left right
definition yeah I think I can hear it
again I might range volume you get this
annoying
pbbb peep
okay I thought we will check it out
against the JBL extreme I will put it on
top so that we really have both speaker
centered and I will put them far away so
that we can crank them a little bit and
see how they can fill the room as you
can see I didn't place them completely
towards the wall to avoid any base
enhancement both have not what I would
call a flat response and both have a
similar bass boost so placing them
directly at the wall would enhance basic
more and maybe create some droning
effects let's have a listen to another
soul persona track and I'm starting
again with their silly and para
it takes a bit time for the GBA
again
JBL takes out all the second
maybe that's listened to in Freud again
just to show you that this effect also
works from yeah from some distance I can
definitely hear left right here to JBL
it's a little bit centered
maybe this is another trick some kind of
smooth jazz funk yeah it has a very nice
stereophonic sound to stereophonic sound
it more diffuse from the treble
something else yeah
every Rock
I will start increasing volume to
maximum for both
you could maybe hear that the JBL seems
to have some some kind of sweet spot
when I make my head the tread will
become stronger and
yeah I think you could hear that there
Celia and parrot before sounded
definitely different in the JPL but well
this is not a bad thing on the contrary
I think it sounds pretty decent
especially regarding the stereo of
separation you get and you could also
hear that it played quite a bit louder
than the JBL without any distortion
without any hint of dynamic compression
I think it could play even louder if
pushed harder just like the JBL which
starts to struggle a bit at higher
levels I think it should go for 399 from
what I heard there will be a known
importer for Europe I'm not sure about
about us but yeah definitely a nice
speaker especially in the wooden body
you get it looks pretty decent I think
what I don't like is that you cannot
quite listen at low levels with this but
maybe they will improve this for the
final versions I'm not sure if it's
released yet or not so yeah this is my
video my soundcheck of the syrian para
p4 i hope you liked it I hope it was
helpful and we will have more to come so
stay tuned and have a nice time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
