guest with me
he took the long way from California to
Vienna to visit us please welcome the
main engineer of Riva and audio design
experts do not move hello all thank you
my pleasure to be here
thanks for coming please don't introduce
yourself what are you doing what's your
job
sir my name is Donald North and I am the
president and chief engineer for audio
design experts as well as our own brand
Riva audio and I head up the product
development and engineering teams so
I've been responsible for the transducer
design the acoustic tuning making sure
everything sounds fantastic and
functions smoothly with all the software
controls and features so basically this
is your baby yet with other words yeah
you designed it until CUNY yeah I'm the
inventor of the trillium algorithm which
up mixes the two-channel stereo into
three channels and we output the three
channels over a left center and right
facing speaker and the three channels
work together in the turbo X with two
passive base radiators and a front and
two in the rear to create a much larger
stereophonic sound especially when
enjoyed indoors okay we already heard
how the turbo X sounds so it's quite an
impressive speaker it's very loud much
louder than the competition thank you so
please tell us what's the what's the
problem of designing such a speaker what
do you have to overcome to make it sound
good sound loud event yeah certainly so
with with small speakers there is just
very little acoustic volume and with
loud speakers you always have to trade
off between efficiency little frequency
extension and an output level and so
and enclosure size and so we have to
define what's the right balance and and
we start by developing the transducers
in-house so we do everything from
designing the diaphragms the frames and
magnet structures the boy squeals all
the components to make the speaker
transducers have as much frequency range
as they can for their size as well as
maximum dynamic range and linear
excursion for their size so it's all
building in-house it's not nothing built
somewhere in I don't know where no yes
designed and yeah so we do all the
initial product design at our offices in
Southern California in Fountain Valley
so we do the transducer design we do the
industrial design which covers how the
product works with all the details we of
course do all the acoustic design and
then we also do the electronic design
with our manufacturing partners okay
and so we are partnered with two large
manufacturers oh diems out of Taiwan one
is named West Iran and the other is
named East Tech and so they are both
investors in ADX as well as
manufacturing and development partners
in auras and what do you think makes the
turbo X better than the competition of
what did you manage better than the
others so I'm a long time - thews iasts
and have a nice big stereo at home that
takes up half the living room and and so
when we develop the turbo X we wanted to
create a speaker which would be what we
thought would be more authentic to the
recordings more honest to the recordings
and try to give more of the hi-fi type
of sound but in a modern miniaturized
form factor so no fake bass or fake
effects no none of that and so we we do
the trillium algorithm processing about
mixing the two channels and the three
channels but besides that insome
equalization we do no other funny
processing to the music we wanted to
come through as honest - the recording
as and as the artist intended I think
the best part about that turbo X is that
it keeps the best bass level always the
same even a top volume there is no bass
reduction no compression and I think
this
well makes you different or better than
most competition which tends to mix
because that pretend to sound good at
lower levels exactly as soon as you
start cranking them a little bit they're
falling apart so now you have brought
something interesting yes I came all the
way to Austria to give you a sneak peak
of our our new baby so what's this this
is the new Riva s so this will be coming
out the summer this is the the baby
brother to the turbo X oh okay so we've
got similar technologies we've got a
seven speakers around three active or
passive whereas the turbo s Lemmons p7
yeah seven speakers so we've got in the
turbo X we have sixty millimeter
transducers in the in the S we go with
forty millimeter and again we designed
them all in-house from the active
transducers and the passive radiators
again to have as wide a frequency range
and that and dynamic range as we could
for their size so we know we got active
on the left center right and passive
radiators on the front and the rear we
have the similar style of capacitive
touch controls on the top with the
proximity sensors so when you move your
hands to it all the buttons illuminate
and you can do all the controls we have
microphones for speakerphone does it
have some IPX weighting like what does
this one is it intended to be an IP x3
we're still in the early phases of
testing but so far everything's looking
very encouraging social splash it showed
me yeah it should be no problem bye-bye
your swimming pool or on the boat or
even during rain or exactly should be no
problem and this one like on the X we
have a removable cover that seals up and
protects the oakley io area for the
auxilary input USB data and that is
stored on the bottom regularly and then
when you need to use it you just take it
off and fit it into the back okay okay
so why do you think that turbo s is
better than the competition well again
we we we we took everything we learned
from the turbo X and try to miniaturize
it and then work even further on the
acoustic tuning such that it sounds
fantastic at low volumes medium volumes
and then
volume and that goes from developing the
transducers to the mechanical design and
and in the structures so that it doesn't
resonate a vibrate to the
custom-designed electronics that we did
that allows for very high peak power so
that we can get the natural dynamics of
the recording no compression like on the
bows no no no we really try to show
through the natural dynamic range from
there okay okay let me blab that I
already heard that well it's a pre
sample but it sounds impressive it's
definitely one of the best speakers that
sighs I've heard so far so when can we
expect it to be available so our plan is
to have it available in late summer is
when we'll be starting production and
then we'll have it released worldwide as
shortly thereafter hmm and it will be
available on three colors sweet girls
have it okay no white and silver just
like you see with the turbo X we will
also have a white and gold well with the
gold grill and then we will have the
dark grey with a Russian version gold
okay thanks a lot for almost led you to
be here this is a beautiful time here in
Austria ah
so guys you've heard if you're
interested in some portable speaker wait
a little bit
I think the turbo s could be a
game-changer for this market thanks
Donald for coming thanks for watching uh
yeah
bye-bye fly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
