have already noticed mini ricca-san on
something new recently as they say
something small has happened and this is
the new mini mini right now I don't want
to make a full review it it's just a
preset that earlier in order to give
them some feedback but I think they are
really up to something and I wanted to
demonstrate you the sound you know most
realistic way and unlike my usual videos
I thought where the binaural microphones
by myself but rather you wear them or
let's say the artificial ears so you
should of course listen with headphones
I also selected this method as it's much
more realistic to judge the loudness of
a speaker usually my eyes appears much
louder as yeah the microphones are close
to my mouth and a speaker has to be
turned much higher so that you really
get a realistic sound impression but in
this case you hear about the speaker's
compared to my voice and you can
hopefully judge better so simply use my
voice I'm sitting around one and a half
metres away from you so we keep the
loudness so it is if I would sit
directly in front of you then you should
really get a very realistic impression
if you listen with headphones yeah but
maybe you know the old mini I like it a
lot
so the midrib is where if you let's say
the part I would say maybe half the size
and I think it's improved in many ways
also some ways I think I like it a
little bit more this time it has a real
vs be included so some complain me too
that the base adjustment of the old
music is not continuous but it is some
jump so it can be that that first kick
appears distorted then it reduces
basically in this case the mini Rick
Minnick does it continuously so there is
a real DSP of course they had to cut
some features it cannot charge external
devices like the old one did or so
better is much smaller although I would
say it sounds a bit better maybe refined
than the old one your own is still the
others so if you want maximum loudness
also together sup I would probably call
from the old one but it's very
impressive that they managed to spit out
even a little bit better sound out of a
small speaker I will tell you
immediately also
feature is that it connects to two
devices at once so we make is with the
iPhone and unfortunately the app is not
working yet on iOS so I have to use an
Android device but usually I prefer
streaming from from an iPhone so I can
switch between
so this varies
so
so you can feel better
there are many other ways to customize
the speaker for example you can use the
button to stop music but that was the to
advance game select anymore
or you can use other people to jump your
next track there are some funny things
like this called edit what you see but
it flashes in there with the music quite
quite a nice and funny features like
this mystic is one so if you don't face
battery life or loudest sound I think I
mean weak meaning is a nice substitute
for daily for the big one I will reduce
one green so it's really windy outside
so you use some some noise
but now it's running their micro class I
would say so it's nearly yeah I mean
it's it's high as you can see so that
both sonic micro is a little flatter but
overall I would say it fits into this
class and I think it sounds definitely
better than
a very low level seats are simply very
cool but we hear some really low phase
by this emphasis on
yeah I don't show you it not because
it's not ready yet something's and it's
quickly funky but what the great thing
about this is it's really works with a
real boost so if you boost the
frequencies boosted am I to make us
equal EQ which reduces for other bands
if you boost bass everything else will
become reduced when this is I can boost
their own pants and this is even louder
so you could you can boost maximum
volume by simply pushing all pants so
this is thank you
everybody's push so it's really nice
also a red face
so from a school in treble booster face
makes humans went down
you play people way more explicit
because what I did mention the price
will be below 100 pounds so around
hundred ten euros maybe this is I think
hundred seventy also battery life is
better I think I managed not full two
hours out of the p2 at maximum volume
why the mini week at make some money
fruit give you three hours being powder
let's say maybe simply foolish solving
MMO but let's check
nicely
he'll be the base sweetie-face
when you get run of this boosted upper
base
was to have some salt adjustment for the
p2 as well for the you never know what
it says some rebase
more inline with the mini size wise this
is a bit strange but still working quite
nicely and together with the sub it
sounds incredible
Oh something nice I think
so much things
you can hear that it's really quite not
that something starts to play I will
detach everything it's quite an
incredible system so still the old music
is great but for normal use at home it's
very low level like it a lot
also because it's so small it doesn't
have any anything to attach but I think
they are working on some kind of sleeve
with some included carabiners so yeah
400 pounds 110 hundred fifteen euros I
think is this really quite a nice
speaker much better I mean we are
talking about the best portable micro
speakers available on the market right
now there's nothing else I don't know I
wouldn't couldn't know any and I think
there's other performs them being even
cheaper and you have the option to
stereo pair it with another one which we
don't have with the p2 you have it with
the post but you can also extend it with
the Sun if needed so and together that's
up to MINIX - Minnie Minnie Minnie
Minnie Minnie Minnie yeah close to a lot
of ice maybe not the loudest the bigger
one is still other but yeah way way
nicer sounding than at JPL extreme or
something so thanks a lot for watching
so it for this interruption but my
camera stopped recording I hope you like
this in a bit this is no recording
method you can of course also check it
out from ice pick up all your data base
I recorded it with flat EQ but for my
personal taste and probably have erased
EQ a little bit as most of the time you
listen of X's and of X's it loses travel
a little bit yes the tune for a full
review soon I hope I can get a second
one tried any stereo or so together with
the staff it should be incredible system
deputy work and one of the best micros
because currently on the market
let's see what if future bring something
new I heard there is some clip three
from JBL on the horizon also a JBL co2
I won't expect too much from them so
thanks again and see you the next to the
next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
