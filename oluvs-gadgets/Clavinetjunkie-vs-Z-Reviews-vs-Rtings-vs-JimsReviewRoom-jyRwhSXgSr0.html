definitely my last video for 2018 not
surprising as in some hours will already
have 2019 so I hope I can still manage
to edit this video and upload it in time
for 2018 so sorry for all this
improvisation but I want to cover some
really important topic also make this
some kind of conclusion for 2018 I hope
it won't become too boring for you but
maybe it might even become interesting
because I will be talking about other
headphone reviewers like Zed reviews
ratings maybe dreams review room but
don't see this as any kind of renting
from my site I simply want to defend
myself a bit as I have the right to and
getting lots of strange hating comments
like your headphone reviews suck stop
doing them or stick to reviewing
Bluetooth speakers this is what you can
you cannot read your headphones this was
a guy called I think Rockstar Hey and
sat in a bad way but then we started
some discussion and he said look at
zetrov yours you could learn something
from him hmm another one was complaining
that yeah I have the same in ear at home
but it sounds different than yours yours
is either fake or your recording method
is not right
you should improve another one yeah
you're in ear according stones and good
check ratings they do it much better
well I try to do my best to really offer
you the best I can with my limited
resources ratings they use a headache
ooh sticks at official head which cost
maybe twenty thousand dollars but we
will maybe check their samples later on
first back to that reviews to this
Rockstar who told me I should learn
something from that reviews I know that
reviews I don't watch his videos it's
mostly talking although he offers some
samples as well and I found this video
of him where he offers us a sample of
the Sennheiser HD 50 X X 58 X Jubilee
which I also have here and I had a look
so yeah the first you see is lots of
equipment I don't even know what all
this stuff is here is amps some HBase
lots of expensive headphones so I think
only they had the headphones from here
are some several thousand dollars so of
course he's way more professional than
me look at all this equipment all this
stuff and gear I wonder what his was
what his wife says already man is
complaining and thinks I'm crazy but I
have maybe five headphones around here
are maybe fifty I wonder if he has a
wife or a family at all maybe not but
this is another topic so seeing this he
has this block here some custom made I
don't know if it's concrete or some
leather I'm real true but it probably
also cost money to create Scythia this
you can see has some microphones inside
not true these are omni's or held your
hand attached to some recorder with XLR
inputs yeah and he offers us this some
sample of the Sennheiser HD 58 X Jubilee
so let's have a listen and let's maybe
talk later
yeah I think you can hear it sounds just
horrible if my Sennheiser HD 50 is X 58
X something like that it would be just
crap I mean this is how I $50 it's quite
decent maybe one of the best in this
price range so I thought yeah I will
look up this track here and do my own
recording like I do with all the other
headphones with this mini DSP system
which cost maybe $200 compared to
whatever he may be one of his
microphones is five hundred or thousand
dollars but what he creates here is just
unusable I am not satisfied with my
method but it's the only thing I can
offer you and I am trying to improve
continuously so I'm tweaking my sound
just putting up a headphone here
pressing record won't work maybe some
are thinking this but this doesn't work
I will show you later on how a headphone
without any kind of compensation or
processing sounds when recorded raw it
doesn't sound it sounds more like what
he is doing here but let's compare his
recording with mine
I found the same track I downloaded
bought it from jewel download and
firstly it's some kind of vinyl rip so
really bad quality
maybe his sauce was better but maybe
let's listen anyhow how both recordings
compare
yeah I think you'd hear although the
origin sauce is already quite bad
quality recordings were not comparable
his and mine are two different worlds
but this is how I hear the Sennheiser HD
58 X not like he recall it here but he
has an electric which I also have his
flag file so we can compare maybe these
two you should hear the differences
it'll be better as the source is much
better quality so let's have a listen
yeah I mean what should I learn from zet
reviews how to dance or how to spend my
money on expensive equipment which I
don't need and sure he used some really
expensive amps for this recording while
I was simply playing from my iPhone and
you could hear the result but it's not
the equipment that counts this is just
200 euros or dollars but rather the work
which is behind it and I invested really
lots of time lots of energy to bring my
recordings as close to reality as
possible within my resources within my
possibilities I will show you later on
how the Sennheiser 58 58 X 58 X come on
sounds an equalized raw it's closer to
what he offers here but I spent really
hours and it's a continuous workflow so
I'm still not satisfied I will probably
never be so again yesterday I improved
my equalizing a bit I will simply show
you my EQ curve for recording over ears
this looks like that so you can see we
have the 3 4 kilohertz deep which
compensates for the ear and head
resonances and so on for recording
India's there is completely different
equalizing needed I will show you man 4
in ears and it looks like this so again
we have this deep at 3 kilo Hertz at
this time also lots of treble boost and
so on and so on and I did this by ear
because it's impossible to make it with
measurements I don't have the know-how I
don't have the possibilities I sit here
I record it and then I listen and my
hearing is till I have I'm sure that
reviews also has a good hearing but
obviously I'm not sure if he listens to
his own recordings then he will know
that this is just nothing so I'm not
sure what should I learn from him he has
definitely some know-how he has heard
maybe thousands of headphones but it
still doesn't make him a quote I don't
know how to recorder maybe another
reviewer I'm not a good reviewer I'm not
a good talker but
least I'm trying to give my best to
offer at least some song samples which
are usable which are somehow which can
be representative they are not perfect
and I know and still I use my Sennheiser
HD 600 as reference for my recordings
together the sauna works profile as I
need some base where I can work on
so when listen for this you should get a
very close representation of the sound
of this or another a headphone or in-ear
there are definitely many which will
differ and say that Sennheiser is not
neutral
according to sauna works it is some say
sauna work suck they have no clue and so
on and so on
take automatic business head true flat
response Suns different person has a HD
600 but I need a bass and for me the
Sennheiser is their most comfortable
because I put it on I can switch between
different headphones and hear
immediately if there is some difference
in sound and then I tweaked my equalizer
my equalizer for over ears consists of
how many bands 12 bands mmm picking
filters and I'm adding new and new once
again because I hear again it's really
not easy I tried it with pink noise so
when I try to equalize my recordings
with pink noise it sounds strange with
music so I'd rather try to use music for
this and I think mmm I'm at least at
some level which is much better than
this what that reviews offers I will
show you again the same track we heard
before how it sounds first with my
equalizing which brings it closer to
what I'm hearing when listening to the
sennheiser HD 58 X Jubilee and now I
managed and then I will switch off the
equalizing so we'll hear how it sounds
wrong so let's have a listen
you could hear the roar recording does
not represent the headphone at all so
it's closer to what he is recording here
yeah I'm really not sure does he listen
to his own recordings you should notice
that it's just but then was
this other guy who said yeah I should
check her ratings do their recordings
quite interesting I mean they have this
expensive head acoustics artificial head
measuring head for I think twenty thirty
thousand thousand dollars and they
managed something like this I'm not sure
what kind of are these engineers or some
some freaks I'm not sure but they made
this review about the case at a s10 and
compared it to the one more triple
driver and yeah maybe let's check simply
the video where he says they sound
similar hmm the case at a s10 and the
one more triple driver are among the
better sounding in ears we have measured
so far and although they sound pretty
similar to each other
our recommendation here would be the
triple driver now before looking at
their measurement results we are going
to play recording we have done with
these headphones so you can get an idea
about how their sound compares for
yourself just keep in mind that this is
a relative comparison and not an
absolute one so it is good for seeing
which hat phone has more bass or treble
for example but you won't be able to
judge their actual sound profile and if
you get one of these headphones and
listen to the same track that we've used
here you most likely won't hear the same
thing
at least he mentioned that the recording
should be taken relatively to each other
not absolutely so you should hear which
one has more bass no treble but it won't
represent the real sound which is what
I'm also trying to tell you still I'm
really trying to bring the recordings
closer to reality so let's compare how
my recording of the case at a stand and
the triple driver sounds compared to
those
I think we would hear their case at a is
10 sounds completely different to the
triple driver
unlike they claim that they sound
similar also I'm not quite sure about
their choice for music for test music as
it only contains of some bass there is
hardly any meets any treble I will show
you some spectrogram of their test track
which looks like this so you can see
there is nothing only some response up
to 3 kilohertz and then only when the
snare comes while here you can see the
response of my test track which is a
much fuller spectrum this is the first
track of my urine test track that I use
for headphones and India's so if only
the choice for a simple test track is so
lame by ratings together this $30,000 at
the official head and then these results
that I am not sure why I have to learn
something from them I mean there may be
professional they have this great game
measuring database and so on but the
recordings can offer me nothing and
probably nothing as well so although I'm
not satisfied with mine I still think
they are much better than both ratings
and zette reviews and not quite sure
about dreams really room he started to
do headphone recordings as well I mean
he does great videos he has really fancy
looking stuff which I wouldn't even know
how to produce such great looking videos
but I'm not sure about his audio
recordings I saw a video where he
compared a ghibli extreme tool with the
sony xba-40 one and some other one they
all sounded the same although he loses
some binaural microphones and so on I'm
not sure how he records his headphones
he never told me he never showed it if
it's with this MBO headset but then how
well does he does he wear them by
himself I'm not sure but as I've shown
by simply pressing record the results
will be just crappy you need more
additional work maybe he does it but he
doesn't want to reveal it I'm not sure
his recordings of the Sony what was is
the
and MX thousand I don't know these
noise-canceling headphones where he
compared it to that boss quite okay I
think also this he demonstrated the
noise canceling abilities where the Sony
was definitely better than the boss also
the sound then he so I video about some
some bass-heavy headphone but already
that the recording was distorted so he
should maybe used a low again but I'm
not sure how represented if they are
because I don't own these headphones so
maybe Jim reveals Jim's really room does
a great job I'm not quite sure I cannot
say he has some great technique but
ratings and that reviews they just suck
those samples I would be ashamed to
offer such samples I'm still not
satisfied with mine by but at least I
try I and I try to continuously improve
although I'm at the point where I rather
think it's not quite possible to really
offer this what I would like to do which
I managed with the speaker's because I'm
quite satisfied with my speaker
recordings they are really realistic if
you listen to them for Sennheiser HD 600
together the SONA works profile you
should get a very close sound to what I
am hearing reality but with headphones
is different all headphones react a
little bit differently when put up here
but I would like to maybe try another
experiment which could interest you this
is really quite unique mmm I would like
to record the I have och one with my
method with my equalizing so let's turn
it on
and then simply to prove how well it my
recording method is and then I will play
back this processed recording through my
reference headphone which is the
sennheiser HD 600 with solo works
profile so I will first record the Iowa
Arc one with a track and then I will
play back this recorded track through my
reference headphone and record it again
and yeah the results would be the same
of course because even when I listened
to the recording of the recording and
compare it to the original headphone it
would still sound more as the same
yeah I chose that Iowa because it has a
particular characteristics it's not
neutral because with the neutral
headphone it will sound similar to to
the original recording but the Iowa has
quite a hefty bass boost also meets I
rather swallow the way there is some
treble peak so will you will get the
characteristics I will first play the
original song from suppose I'm Prince
Fisher from the latest album and they
are working on a new one by the way so I
will enhance this maybe another video so
first the original track then you will
hear the I bar 3 call it a bar and then
the recording of the iowa played back
through the sennheiser and recorded
again so a recording of a recording of a
headphone yeah and later on maybe you
can tell me how what do you think about
it so let's say
it's not 100% the same but it's close so
the recording of the recording still
captured their characteristics the the
essence of the headphone quite well yeah
ask ratings was that we used to do the
same I'm not even sure if they have some
kind of reference system which they use
I'm not sure if they just the built-in
compensation curves which come with this
head this $30,000 if I could have for
one like this you would have the best
results error because I would invest so
much time I mean this head is really
this is professional gear which is used
by really I don't know measuring
companies and so on I cannot afford one
like this I'm already stretching myself
a bit to buy something like this so yeah
tell me there is a lipid less bass with
the recording of the recording so but
it's probably because it's still despite
a sauna Works profile it's I'm not sure
but you could hear that the essence of
the IVA was still captured quite well
and I think this is a proof that my
recording method is not that far off
like all the others yet askjeeves really
don't really room to do this you should
recall a headphone this
both or maybe something which has really
some particular sound and then play be
played back again through his headphone
which he uses maybe and should still
sound like the same I'm really curious
because I think this is not easy to
achieve I mean I can show you how the
Iowa sounds without my-my-my
compensation it's called equalization or
whatever so you will hear but the Iowa
first wave by processing and then
without switching back back and forth so
you get a better idea
so out of this or all which is very
resonant you could hear there is this
peak at around 3 4 kilohertz also travel
is missing way too much bass I have to
create something which resembles the
sound of this headphone and it's really
it's a dreary task I'm already bored of
all this but I'm trying to give to offer
you my best that I can
my spare time and then I'm getting such
 asshole comments your headphone
reviews suck go and learn from zetrov
use whatever and this is what makes me
really angry because I know maybe you
this this effort is not visible it's not
durable I know someone complained I
checked it back I also have the
Sennheiser HD in front and my Sony image
1 sounds different I backtracked if they
bet back checked it back back checked it
again had a listen after his complaint
to the Sony MH 1 and listened over the
Sennheiser HD 600 my recording and it's
not 100% the same but the
characteristics is captured way better
than all these recordings from the
others you can still notice you can hear
this is the Sony I know there are some
let's have a look at the at the EQ curve
from from my any recordings again you
can see there is where is it here
I tried there are some strange Peaks
which I'm not quite sure it sounds very
some sort metallic to me therefore I
tried to reduce here in the area of 12
kilo Hertz then again at 15 kilohertz
also some narrowband I can show you some
some different versions so this was this
is version 7 let's see maybe version 6
and see it changes completely because I
was not satisfied although because he
complained I thought yeah I should have
another listen so if
my current equalizing is already a
little bit better
let's check version 5 you can see like
this also a litte bit changed
let's see version version 4 where is it
here a much broader picture at 12 kilo
Hertz because I heard there is something
from the recording from the resonance
whatever I am not sure what it is there
is something I tried to figure it out
with pink noise but couldn't find it
well so it's really I am so bored with
all this and then all this comment with
these comments which make me not angry
in simply said because this makes me
really go and stop with all this and
then simply stop because if the the
effort and and my my my my my aim is not
not taken well or it's not accepted then
then it doesn't make sense why should I
waste my further time I thought I will
do version 8 9 10 to really bring to
perfection perfection but I'm not sure
if it's possible with this stupid system
here because with some in years when
when an India sounds good on its own
when it has a rather neutral tuning it
sounds quite close to what I'm hearing
but when an India sounds off like this
case at a is 10 which sounds off
although many still tend to differ they
say how does it come that you will come
that you don't like any in ear I like in
ears many but they have poor too they
need to have some kind of base 6 which
sounds ok this one doesn't
therefore I'm surprised oh great cable
connection therefore I am surprised how
such a professional site like ratings
can say that this sound seminar the
TripAdvisor and the case a test and they
sound completely different to my ears
not incomparable although the general
measurement like shown in their video
might be similar but I mean the general
measurement should be a flat line
but when there start to be some peaks
and dips then it becomes interesting the
less of these deep sand Peaks you have
the more
normally it sounds but the craft of
course for in ears the kerf is not a
flat line like for a speaker but you
have some peak at 2.53 killers then it
goes down again and again some trailing
peak simply because of the of the entire
HR TFS also the ear canal reason
resonances inside but it has to be a
smooth line this is the natural response
of an ear not something like this like
all those measurements shown look at the
measurement of the animatic er 4x are
not that as a are because it has a bit
too little bass but the other one has
quite flat based and it raises then it
goes down again it's a smooth curve by
all the others you know and some zigzag
and any like this cannot sound good
because you have own resonances and you
add additional ones maybe some don't
hear it all they don't care I'm not sure
but I care for this I really I am
I mean why should I spend five hundred
dollars for an India which has a
completely screwed up frequency response
if I couldn't have one which cost ten
dollars and sounds way better okay then
I heard some critic criticism yeah but
it's low a basis low it's not as
resolving it's not whatever the problem
is I don't care about soundstage
resolving when a frequency response is
the basics of the sound if this is off
then everything else I don't care about
it it can have the greatest soundstage
whatever but if it sounds off yeah I
could maybe try to equalize it but then
I would have to apply the equalizer for
any source which is impossible if it had
some built-in equalizer maybe I will
review some the ODC
I silent and the LCD I for three thought
$2,500 in here without equalizing
unusable it sounds horrible it sounds
worse than those try if I stop here and
they ask $2,500 for it he hates planet
planar magnetic whatever you know you
have this in your over years let's say
but I usable without an equalizing then
you have the size
cable or some additional plugins where
you can add some EQ curve to make it
sound normal
but without it it doesn't I wouldn't
spend 10 dollars for such a song yeah it
has a different sound stage but I
wouldn't say it's new its natural for me
the automatic still sounds way more
natural way more precise imaging and
also frequency response without an
equalizing sound just right and correct
to me so I think it was enough I'm not
sure anyone will look this to the end
anyhow and just talked about all this
you can eat no ignorance about this this
also hate I'm not sure why why why are
you hating me because I try to offer you
the real sound because you you like the
case that and I don't therefore you hate
me it doesn't sound good
regardless how how great you find it it
simply doesn't sound good
there is there has to be some some kind
of basics some absolute value doesn't
have nothing to do with more bass less
bass no it's the basic tuning which is
just off yeah I think that was it I'm
not sure how I will continue with 2019 I
might stop all this because I'm getting
bored and I'm getting annoyed by many of
you and although I appreciate all the
support and help from all the others
which like who like what I'm doing but I
ask myself why why do I this why why am
I wasting my time with this I don't earn
that much money with YouTube that I
could do this for living but I spent
nearly more time with with this creating
videos listening back and forth creating
EQ curves then I do at work so why am I
doing this
so maybe 2019 I will stop I still have
lots of products to cover so I will of
course do but the most let's say the
most logic conclusion would be to stop
with YouTube because it doesn't make
sense it makes me sick all this hate all
this ignorance and I've just feel bored
with this
doesn't make sense I try to offer you
something but I'm not satisfied and I'm
not sure I will ever be I stopped with
music because I was not satisfied with
my results I was not talented enough I
could not play piano well I had some
hearing I always I always played only by
ear but I was not I didn't see I thought
yeah I'm not good enough there are
better ones why should I continue and
maybe this is the sustain next step for
YouTube and I will stop all this still I
have really many products speakers
headphones in ears spirit this Odyssey
quite interesting one really
but for $2,500 that the eye for no no
this is just yeah I will try to measure
it also to offer you some sound samples
but then again people will say no this
is not how it sounds in reality yeah I'm
not sure but even less is what ratings
offers here it's really quite hard to
recall any years it's not enough to
press record you have to talk lots of
work
and it's not enough to apply a simple
compensation curve like the one included
here let me see
do I have one here this is the included
compensation curve for the 14 years you
can see very simple but looks very
different to this what I'm so when I
overlay
mine again you can see it looks like
this mmm
so when I record it in is with this
included compensation which comes this
would sound even more off what neither
represent the in-ear itself nor be
really well to listen to yeah but I will
stop now
this is this was it for 2018 thanks a
lot for all your support for all those
who really yeah followed me all the way
but I'm not quite sure what 2019 will
bring currently yeah I need some break
and some some thoughts some
but I'm a little bit disappointed with
all this also yeah because I'm investing
too much time and and it's just it's
nothing I mean that there is no value in
this what I'm doing I cannot I cannot
buy buy me some bread because of some
likes you know nothing I mean yeah if my
videos only attract thousand viewers why
has some other base test attracts 1
million they hadn't cannot continue with
it you know and I'm not interested in
base test or in I don't know in whatever
I tried to offer you something valuable
also to reveal all this crap which is
out there all this in hype which 90% are
simply unusable I wouldn't like to
listen to music with them you can get
really decent stuff for below fifty
dollars below hundred dollars and then
it's enough mmm not necessary to spend
thousand dollars for some crappy
sounding in here like those Andromeda
whatever or some shoe models which sound
really creepy so I hoped I could maybe
yeah clear up all this confusion there's
this strange ignorant people obvious
don't carry any on yeah I'm satisfied
with my shure se215 or whatever sound
just muddy and and some strange peak at
5 kilohertz so yeah now it's 3 time to
stop I hope you like this little bit as
conclusion yeah thanks for all that
thumbs down again and yeah see you next
year or tomorrow or I'm not sure when I
will manage to upload this and let's see
what 2019 will bring maybe this will be
the farewell of clavinet junkie maybe
this was it with you two or maybe I will
continue I will somehow manage I don't
know but currently everything is a
little bit unsure yeah so I have to go
to bed it's past midnight it's 1 o'clock
at night I started before
all this preparation and everything so I
have to go to bed clean up my bed where
I put everything on my headphones so
thanks a lot and yeah see you next year
