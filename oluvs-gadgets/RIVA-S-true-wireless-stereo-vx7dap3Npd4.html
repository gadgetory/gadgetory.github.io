to River s here why - well one of them
will be soon given away to one of my
subscribers so please stay tuned for
more details in an upcoming video but
first I wanted to demonstrate you the
true Wireless Stereo feature in the
meantime many Bluetooth speakers support
true wireless stereo but very few of
them have the really high Phi and Sirius
tuned sound like the real s and two
speakers simply sound much better than a
single one you get real stereo without
any wires with without any hassle and so
on and with this video I wanted to show
you how to set them up for true alastair
how easy it is also how much better to
sound compared to a single one and also
how how much louder to play compared to
a single device as always I will be
using my binaural microphones and the
head came to give you a kind of light
impression so please put up your
headphones for the best results and we
will check the true wireless stereo mode
out with through Wireless one is always
master this is the one and connected to
and the other one slave but first let's
have a listen to a silly one how this
sounds
maybe we can enable surround well not
much of a difference so to enable true
Wireless you have to keep surround and -
pressed on the master it jumps into the
pairing mode and surrounding + on the
slave and after some time they should
connect and we can have a listen again
they need a bit of time to connect yeah
now you hear them playing in stereo
the controls in the slave are disabled
so you cannot turn it off while you can
control volume and everything from the
master only if I turn off the master the
slave will be also turned off to disable
through a listeria keeps around and mute
button pressed
and we have again only a single one
plane
to better show you the difference
between true eyeless stereo mode and
sing mode I thought I'll set them up
like this and I will record them one
after the other and do the switching in
post-processing this way you will hear
better what benefit the true wireless
stereo mode
now I thought let's have a listen how
much softer a single one will play
compared to two in stereo I'm starting
with a single one first
what we could also try is set them much
further apart to see how they are able
to fill the whole room I put them up
like this and let's have a listen all
again maximum
I hope it was pretty obvious that two
are simply much better to fill a big
room with real stereo sound I know it's
not a cheap solution but anyone having
the money I think it's really worth it
they substitute a smaller stereo system
while still being portable without any
wires and so on as already mentioned I
will give away one of them so stay tuned
for more details in an upcoming video I
hope you liked it so far
stay tuned for more and have a nice time
bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
