to give you an update about my channel
I'm here with Jimmy we are doing a walk
I thought it's nicer like this than
sitting at home talking and you can also
enjoy the forest through a little bit
yeah I'm blessed to live near a forest
many don't they lives in some city or
whatever so I'm doing walks every day
and I really enjoyed the beautiful
landscape the atmosphere here and I hope
you are enjoying it as well so the
biggest news some of you probably
already noticed clarinet junkie is dead
my channel is named all ups gadgets now
I should have done this since the very
beginning but when I started YouTube I
didn't quite know yeah that it would
evolve into something like it is now so
I didn't know I would do speaker or
audio reviews I chose the name which is
somehow music related I was always into
jazz funk fusion so clavinet the typical
instrument and I wanted to choose ROS
junkie as the Fender Rhodes is my
favorite instrument Hancock Chick Corea
and so on but Rhodes junkie was already
given so yeah I like heavy Hancock used
the clarinet very often in his tracks as
a substitute for a rhythm guitar so I
chose clarinet junkie but now my channel
is all those gadgets therefore clearly
junk is dead
and the bigger more important news is
that I got some interesting mails
comments I activated comments for my
last video on purpose as I simply didn't
want any pity from you yeah we are so
sorry to hear and so on so the matter
with Amazon is closed for me like some
suspected that they closed it because I
didn't I didn't show my links as
affiliate links it's not what's not the
reason according to them I violated some
terms and conditions namely that I
generated Amazon traffic without people
clicking on my links first which of
course is I mean this would
sound as if I was doing something with
my links
promoting them or whatever
I don't even have the time for this so I
think this must have been some error
well it could be also some kind of
revenge maybe from some hater so maybe
some bought used my links spread them
around and Amazon noticed it but I
didn't do anything with those links
definitely not generating any traffic or
at least not that I'm conscious of and
unfortunately they were very
unresponsive the next because I asked
what is the exact reason for this maybe
I can correct this maybe my site does
something which I which I'm not aware of
but I got the same response again the
matter is closed we cannot help you
anymore and after that two weeks later
all other Amazon affiliate accounts were
closed too because I violated the terms
and conditions for the German one which
of course I didn't I also tried to
object with the u.s. account because
this was my main account so Amazon comm
was always my first because my main
viewership is from the US so most links
I put in from the US but they didn't
help they couldn't yeah it simply is the
matter is closed for them and if I try
to open a secondary account which I
floss I tried I try to do it for my
mother and this was also closed two
weeks later because they noticed somehow
that she's affiliated with me which is
somehow connected to me so let's forget
about Amazon but yeah the news that I
wanted to talk about you is or are I got
a very nice email from Colleen who is
the editor of an online headphone
magazine called head headphone st not
headphone honesty's about headphone st
quite quite nice and he offered me to
sponsor my channel with some money for
the next month yeah I won't disclose the
exact amount but this will of course
help me to continue so thanks a lot :
I really appreciate this a lot I mean he
must do obviously a better business than
me because I somehow during these eight
nine years what I I think I started 2011
so eight years I somehow didn't manage
to become rich or to do something out of
it
I never had a big talent for making
money and to be honest I never this was
never my intention so I never wanted to
to get rich from YouTube I did this as a
hobby I already told you so I wanted to
give you my honest opinion about audio
products about products in general there
forget it gadgets I could have made
mention all apps audio or olives
yeah audio reviews or whatever but as I
also reviewed some other stuff like some
scooters I will I'm expecting a new
quite interesting scooter soon so for
those interested I will of course try to
do a video about it but back on top it
on topic so thanks Colin he will help me
a lot to continue with YouTube I already
prepared some videos that I will upload
soon and he had I will always insert
this link so that you know that he
helped to somehow make this channel
alive I hope everyone will thank call
him too by visiting his side maybe
clicking on some of his affiliate links
yeah Marie not sure what has happened I
could imagine that it was some kind of
hater some kind of revenge act maybe
even from some company because I bash
their products but this is the problem I
cannot accept free samples or I don't
want to ask for free samples simply by
by expecting them to be great then you
get the sample you get the unit and it
sounds like crap so what should i do
should I give you my honest opinion
about it and then put off the the
company they sent it to for free to me
still I bash it I mean if the product is
crap it's not my fault I'm sorry
therefore I rather prefer not to accept
free samples only if I simply cannot
afford them if you speak across thousand
two thousand dollars I cannot buy this
I'm sorry you use oh my my income from
YouTube which has raised a little bit
during the last two weeks but on average
in the last month it was around six
hundred seven hundred dollars a month so
I simply cannot invest this money into
all the equipment all the time I need to
buy new microphones I bought new
microphones
both new cameras I'm shooting with the
DJ I was more PocketNow which I think
gives a very nice image so all money
most of the money that I got get from
YouTube course of course into some
equipment into into yeah audio stuff and
so on and so on and of course I have to
use some for a living - I mean I had a
family and so on it's on so
unfortunately I'm in quite a weird
situation right now because I got I got
some samples of the affront free that I
tuned more or less which would be final
yeah unfortunately they don't sound like
I intended they're far off so not even
close so I'm in quite a bit of a weird
situation we are trying to figure out
what went wrong
if the EQ settings imported didn't
translate well or whatever so it's not
that easy I would sit down here so we
can talk a bit better let me switch over
to for my face maybe so that you know
that it's really me oh this is ugly
sorry so but I will I think I will let
you enjoy the view here which is of
course nicer so just let me try I will
show you there the final version of the
in years we are looking like this
unfortunately yeah they start completely
different and we are trying to figure
out what's going on I will give Jimmy
something to drink
it's a bit rushed everything so it's not
easy with one hand there for a head
mounted camera is much easier to operate
Jimmy Shaw does the supreme so wait let
me try to open this with one hand also
not that easy
so batter this miss my hinge there they
stop because Disney save a Hearton so
Nick mother saw him so Marty batter
batter darkened is Vasa
so let lets let's let him drink a little
bit so the infantry we are working on it
to bring them to that level that I
expected that I simply wanted and I feel
really so bad now because the product
that I got is not even close to what I
intended and we are trying to figure out
is it some kind of translation error of
the settings are the units is there some
simple variation so maybe that tuning I
based my non was a bit flawed or
whatever and the time try to close this
the so the time is really we have to
rush this a little bit as they should be
released now in the end of June
therefore I hope you will manage and I
hope the final unit will be as like I
simply intended I wanted to offer you a
sound and this is what I always try I
try to promote or not hide but I try to
push products that I personally am
satisfied with that I personally would
like to use would love to listen to I
cannot promote product that I'm
personally not really satisfied so if I
get a sample or if I buy speaker and
it's not what I personally like I will
of course say so but yeah talking of
speakers here I have a new one here it
is it's also from earphone the upcoming
speaker called you boom which is quite
interesting let's put this away
it's let me see the camera is it's not
that easy to shoot with the DJI Osmo
pocket is there is always some delay
because of the gimbal so this is the
even you boom designed by the same
engineers like the tribute ex bomb but
yet better in all aspects its louder
more controlled sounds better more
natural with better base more base also
rugged waterproof has an outer in the
malls there the auto mode discuss it
reduces base but I would simply turn it
on and let you listen a little bit
so they can get an idea so I'm connected
and it sounds like this
how come here is so this is with this
normal indoor mode without this you lose
space the difference becomes rather
minimal at at high levels but at low
levels it's really quite bass heavy it's
only directional similar design to the
credit ex boom but the drivers are here
at the bottom with pricey freighters at
both sides so I think it sounds quite
nice I compared it back and forth to the
Bose Soundlink revolve to the JBL
speakers also to the trivet ex mom and I
think this sounds definitely way nicer
let's work something else I know many
like rap and so on and that makes you I
would even turn off this this or turn on
auto mode because I mean bass does not
compress as much you lose some lower
base but it's it's not silver anymore
but you can hear at low levels pretty
bass heavy it definitely sounds nicer
than oppose something revolve more
natural somehow and maybe let's try this
and let's step back a bit far away I
will turn volume on maximum is it really
not easy
so this is mixing volume as you can hear
pretty loud also controlled with nice
sound this right is
and it's an omnidirectional speaker we
can listen from all angles
she means dances to the music I will
reduce volume again let's listen from
the other side maybe now let's turn on
this base so you can hear at low levels
- it's definitely some difference again
mixing volume not the loud speaker
definitely not enough and pretty
controls pretty nice sounding I will of
course do a more detailed video need
some kind of Pisa maybe but so far I am
quite impressed and maybe let's try some
track from from Sol P what do we have
here so with this you should hear you
should hear the difference or the sound
of course here gets slightly nicer
Trevor it's similar as it was on the
treated expo but this one's definitely
more natural maybe even upside down the
same effect we have from the post
something evolved I think they the
driver should have been at the top
because at the bottom they reflect how
much with the surface underneath
therefore you get some some mixture some
comp filtering and so on so it supports
they are pairing with another one so
Reed stereo no party mode I have two of
them so we can try this out and price
will be around $60 I think it will be
released now at the end of June and I
think it's really a bargain for what you
get
definitely blows away all the other
similarly price because especially only
rection ones it does a great job but
stay tuned for my more detailed video
kind of teaser maybe or review depends
on when I manage so I will turn it off
again and
Jimmy is quite happy about the high
grass yeah
the Boston has the hing Gillick yeah so
here I am blessed to live here in a
forest this is my village below there
but don't think that I'm somehow reach
or whatever we had luck to find the
house which was quite cheap and it was
not cheap so I didn't buy it on eBay or
something and it took us lots of energy
to get the credit from the from the bank
which would pay for the next 15 15 years
but regarding what you know what we have
here it was quite cheap and thanks to my
father who had to in u.s. it was still
on a very old level like 70s so not that
modern and we managed to renew it
slightly therefore it appears may be
added as if I was rich which of course
is not true so just because I'm living
in a house with such a view I think this
was pure coincidence that that we
managed so again thanks a lot to all of
you for any kind of support also thanks
a lot for calling for managing for
offering me this let me switch over here
to offering me this this chance to
support my channel too
how do you say in English to sponsor my
channel so this is the first kind of
sponsoring that I have and I will of
course shout out and shout out every
time to his side headphone asti have a
look if you are interested in two in-ear
headphones and so on he does some great
videos and yeah I will of course
continue I already prepared a full
review of the Marshall stock way to
which I will publish during the next
days I still have to finish editing it
definitely one of my current favorite
speakers this one of course this one of
course also great for those who are on a
budget probably one of the best
omnidirectional speakers in this price
range 50 60 dollars it's a no-brainer
really I have no reservation only you
have no battery indicator but it has a
great battery charging is done by USB
see which of course is nice so you have
to scratch here something is biting me
so coming up next some other speakers
some other surprises so my channel will
be kept alive thanks to my supporters of
course any donation any kind of donation
will help me to continue but as for now
I am quite happy that Colin Douglas took
this job and yeah nothing else to say I
will pack everything again and maybe we
will continue our work jean-yves is not
as drinking so it's a kind of life video
just didn't work
sorry drinking hmm dunno him this him
when I came I better make him up
okay he doesn't want to drink anymore so
let's let's close this I didn't want to
take my head cam as I think the DJI Osmo
pocket does a great job with with image
quality and it captures this landscape
quite realistic and so my next job will
be to manage to analyze the tuning for
the earphone way you found three so if
the different wave is the full sized
headphone
you're also coming from your fans own
Eastern Nevada
so the Ephraim wave will be the next
headphone that I already presented on my
in my German boy for real blue video I
made a shot a short introduction to the
earphone with my tuning it's still not
clear if it will have my tuning I
personally think it sounds very nice now
with this tuning definitely better than
most other headphones wireless ones that
I've heard it's not neutral but has an
appealing sound with the also bass
deeper bass I reduce the upper base
because it's quite bass heavy also
managed to smooth out treble in a bit so
I compared it against the pure play h4
against the stoy fur against the iowa
and so on and I think the earphone wave
with my tuning in case they really
decide to somehow take it sounds better
than all these four also fifty dollars
or something or even forty dollars
doesn't have nice cancelling but it's
very nicely tuned not because I did it
and from what I know the first feedback
was they didn't like the mids although I
really I did everything to make it sound
natural so I'm not quite sure if many
people work on the product it's not easy
so I personally I'm convinced that I did
a great job
that the tuning is all it close to
perfect without without pretending a
neutral sound but rather a fun tuned
twist as we stop Kaka I see sweet so
let's see maybe I can convince them to
use my tuning but a little bit shocked
now that the result for the infantry
became so different to what I intended
I'm expecting new samples from them also
an tune so I can back check again if
there is some sample variation and so on
and so on but we have really little time
as the that the production should start
now at the end of June or so I think
yeah this week so I hope we will manage
everything perfectly
so apart from that we don't want to talk
about Amazon anymore I really think this
must have been some kind of either error
or some oversight but I don't think I
did didn't do anything illegal
I mean I put links in all my video yeah
I don't mock them as affiliate maybe
someone even complained at Amazon but
then I would have understood if they
told me that I violated terms and
conditions like that I didn't that I
didn't expose the links as affiliate but
I remember one asshole one German
asshole once commented on my video your
links are not marked as affiliate I will
sue you I mean come on
of course I entered in a rude way but
who which normal person would even care
if someone has their affiliate link so
this must have been some really asshole
and maybe he did it all it was some
company that that were simply
unsatisfied because I bashed their
products I mean I dressed so many there
can be so many ways simply use one of my
links put them somewhere on social media
and so on yes some of you have also
noticed that I have closed my Twitter
account yeah I was I didn't use it I
don't even know what what's the purpose
of Twitter I mean if I have some news
for you I will put this on YouTube
i tawt get any money from Twitter I
don't even know how people can can make
money with this because yeah and and it
would be just waste of time for me to to
put up content therefore youtube is my
main social media source and if I have
something new I will of course post
there and regarding this patreon thing I
would think about it if I really have
high plains or big plans to improve my
channel even further I thought about a
completely new database this that from
scratch not based on YouTube because my
intention back then was to offer
everything everything everything for
free and just by monetizing the videos
also with affiliate links so all this
income was lost and the videos were
never monetized because then their
starting procedure if you if you start
the playback or jump to another track it
started for a script otherwise you would
not be able to synchronize to videos and
the views are counted but somehow and
what really so I never got an income
from this accept your donations and I
was never satisfied with the current
state of the database because it's a bit
unstable it does not work on mobile
devices because it's based on YouTube
and I get copyright claims because of
Tchaikovsky come on
so I want my plan would be to start a
complete in your database including
floor-standing speakers small speakers
headphones in so it would be a really a
kind of virtual listening room where you
can listen to everything that I get my
hands on and this will be quite unique
I noticed that some other companies
especially stores B and H or some other
store or RadioShack I'm not sure they
have some virtual listening mmm studio
whatever but from what I know also some
German site what's the name I don't I
don't remember but they have some
something like that some kind of
database with binaural but these are not
speaker recordings or not speaker they
capture the speaker rather with some
impulse response so they they measure
the impulse response in an anechoic
chamber and then apply this through some
algorithm onto their listening room yeah
but this doesn't represent the reality
an impulse response doesn't capture all
aspects of a novice speaker namely no
intermodulation distortion or other
stuff therefore I had a listen to this I
don't remember if it was really being
they chose another one but I had a
listen and they all sounded the same to
me so they didn't really manage to
capture I mean I have to I have to
Marshall Stockwell - at home now and it
was sound different and I can show you
show this through a video so how can -
difference because from completely
different companies sound
same therefore something is flawed here
so let me try some some way down here to
finish our walk I hope you enjoyed this
landscape a little bit especially for
all those who don't live in the forest
like me but it can also become boring
after some time so let's go here so my
idea would be to create a completely new
database not based on YouTube not based
on videos but on on audio files sound
files that you can easily sync there are
also three at the same time because I
know there was some some proposal to
always have a third video for comparison
so I thought one will be always the
original track and then the other tool
will be either speaker a Speak Up D or
headphone a head headphone B or you
could even compare a headphone to to a
speaker but then of course I will have
to optimize my recording method this
takes lots of time maybe invest into new
equipment especially for in is I would
like to get those more expensive
couplers which would it would cost me
maybe including the amp and so on maybe
thousand five hundred dollars so I'm
really dependent on on you on your kind
of yes support so therefore if I decide
to make this patreon thing I will start
everything from scratch with a new
database and then every mmm every backer
every patreon supporter will get in
excess to the database the old one will
be will die out so I won't put put in
any news because anymore and for the new
database I will probably have to start a
completely new completely new recordings
and not quite so maybe there will be
because I have all speakers already
recorded in my old living room but the
plan is in future to record everything
in a new room in acoustically treated
this will also take lots of money lots
of time to build up the cellar to
optimize it to treat it acoustically and
then record everything down there which
shouldn't be as River B as like my like
my living room
yeah I also want to go away from the
living room because I I'm dependent on
my family that I can make videos so I
have to yeah I have to to send them out
for half an hour then I'm stressed to
finish I need several takes in order to
get it right and I'm becoming nervous
therefore now you know why why I'm
talking so fast simply because I have
lots of stress lots of and very nervous
to finish everything in time before my
family comes back or whatever but if I
had some kind of recording studio in my
cellar I could maybe concentrate better
prepare more for the videos or so make
them more interesting maybe without any
life life camera whatever so I have some
plans but of course I can only realize
them if I yeah if I get some some some
some money some some funding because
otherwise I cannot afford all this it's
already told you I'm not rich just
because I live in a house at the pool
you could see it's very old it's older
than me maybe or nearly as old as me
starting to fall apart so I'm not rich
and the income I get from YouTube is
also ridiculous compared to what many
other youtubers gamers are getting had
gamer channels this German
what's-his-name no very popular German
Mo was also in the headlines because of
some criminal activity let me see what
was his name Monta Montana something so
I mean he one month he managed so much
income like me doing this this whole or
eight years which is of course
incredible I mean if I could make at
least $5,000 a month I could follow this
but not with six seven hundred this is
impossible I mean this is it it appears
maybe much for for someone who is living
there
that that development or how do you say
development Papa hope yet need to me so
now that one time was to hopping so come
here and hit beholder so $700 may appear
match for someone who is living in a
developed country but it's not much if
if you live in Europe was 700 this is
below the the existence the minimum I
would need at least if I pay if I pay
taxes for everything I would need three
four thousand dollars a month to really
be able to live from this and it would
it still won't be a life yeah of a
millionaire so I could just pay all my
bills and so on and so on
as to actually a better break a hip
laugh so yeah also very nice here nice

can up and a half a half pistol let's
get down to the to the water here so I
hope you enjoyed at least if not my
talking then all this nice landscape
here and I wanted to thank again Colin
and everyone who somehow believes in me
I wanted to thank Amazon for their s
holism Henry not sure you have you
cannot do anything you are so helpless
but even within the terms and conditions
it's written that there that they are
allowed or the take hand stop cancel
your account anytime without providing
even reasons so if someone complained
about my affiliate link in they could
yeah they could stop it and not even
provide me any reasons simply because
one Payton maybe thousand dollars or two
thousand whatever I mean and just
suspecting but this guy who wanted to
sue me because my affiliate links are
not marked as such is this also
ridiculous
who would really care a normal person so
this must be some
kind of asshole yeah I will finish now

last time now thanks to all of you and I
will continue with the channel soon yeah

weather is nice we get lots of like us
driving on the next one coming here I
never understood what their purposes of
driving around I mean they are not
driving to work now
they are simply driving around and
making noise so yeah stay tuned for my
upcoming videos I have some nice
surprise at 12:00 back in time also some
speakers the bear that I would have
never expected to get are coming I will
tell you more later on but remember that
clarinet junkie is dead there is no
claim in a junkie anymore
also because many many called me Calvin
or whatever I mean claiming a junkie has
nothing to do with Calvin it was really
the instrument the Hohner clavinet which
is every musician should know what the
clarinet is at least those who are a
little bit affiliated to Jess and front
