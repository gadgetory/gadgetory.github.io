to make a short video about that final
audio e mm in-ear headphone I think
those are suggested by someone of you
but I don't want to concentrate that
much on it I even didn't want to make
this video but we're looking at some
other reviews that are raving about it
like here from the verge this year's
best value earphones are $45 final e mm
or hear from headphone eeeh final audio
e 2000 3000 and nice surprise or hear
from reviewed these affordable earbuds
provide great sound quality for the
price I even read some review claiming
that it's the best below fifty dollars
well I don't think so and therefore I
want to clear this up I paid forty five
fifty euros for 25 years I got three of
those sony MH one here and I think the
Sony it's an old unit I think three four
years old completely blows this away I
mean it's not really that bad but
compared to the Sony it is bad and if
you consider that you can get this one
round maybe eight nine ten dollars it's
really really bad so when I listen to it
like this like I would normally put them
in I get some strange peak around seven
kilo Hertz not great sounding it becomes
a bit better when I push it forward so
when I push them like this but as soon
as I leave them the sound becomes again
peaky when pushed forward the peak maybe
shifts towards thank you no head so you
get a little bit more treble but I'm not
sure I tried different tips but I always
get the strange harshness so I would
like to let you listen first first the
final audio
e mm compared against the Sony mhm one
and later on I will show you some
measurements and we'll also discuss this
so let's have a listen
is it just a dream my name inside my
fantasies call to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you
am i searching you I wanna feel
I think you could hear the Sony sounds
Wayne I saw a smooth out or someone
neutral with the final audio I get this
nested peak around six seven kilowatts
it's not only me also the ears here it's
a little bit more exaggerated so I'm not
sure maybe it's my ears but also these
obviously don't render them that well
let's just have a look at the
measurements and you can see left right
trailer is not match that well so let's
average them and here are we overlay the
Sony also average for left and right in
green and you can see it doesn't have
this peak probably similar meets are
also maybe similar base extension is
better this only mh1 the final audio mm
starts to roll off below hundred Hertz
so I think you could see they are really
not that great like many reviews are
trying to suggest I mean the unknown bed
bed either I definitely heard much worse
was like the sound magic attend crap
that I reviewed some time ago but there
is some harshness in the presence region
which depending on your ear geometry
might shift either from five to six
seven kilohertz or even up to eight nine
so they become a little bit more
bearable so when I push them forward
like this they sound okay but still
power from the Sony stay sound way
smoother much nicer overall also better
match to a left and right so I don't
quite understand all the hype here
although yeah my Sony unit here the
image one see I have is maybe not that
representative the other three ones I
got sound a little bit different they
have a more smile response still that
sound signature is more less the same
but with more bass and treble boost
therefore maybe I have quite a unique
unit yeah I know I heard that there is
some sample variation Simoniz have more
bass some have less bass but as the
other ones also more less the same with
more bass I might think that those are
more representative than mine but this
particular unit sounds amazing I prefer
it over the Sennheiser HD 600 somehow
smoother also travel is so nice I love
it
hey justice swaiiow is annoying although
here I showed it wrong you have to put
it behind your neck and then it's quite
okay so I hope this review or video
about the final audio e mm was helpful I
don't quite understand all the hype
around it it's not that great you can
definitely find much better ones even
the samsung s8 bundle sounds when I
sudden there's way more exciting
more neutral because it doesn't have
these strange Peaks so I hope it was
helpful little bit thanks for watching
and soon the next video have a nice time
and bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
