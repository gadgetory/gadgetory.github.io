I wanted to make a short video and throw
in the Mickey
MC 250 here this was brought to my
attention by one of my viewers who I
usually trust quite a bit he claimed
that it replaced his - H e 400 I was
something which is I think three hundred
four hundred dollars this is hundred I
bought it immediately as I wanted to
have a listen it's a closed back
headphone it says studio reference
professional closed back headphones
maximum comfort take them anywhere so
you can also fold them they become
smaller but not sure why you because you
can see it's still quite big the wire is
really long so maybe three meters or
something you can see but it's
replaceable it's a simple 3.5 millimeter
connector so plug it in twist it and it
holds in place so comfort wise really
nice doesn't feel very very soft
Cashion's you can see the ear heads a
little bit closed so you have to fit the
ear inside and yeah I mean it's claimed
to be studio reference so hopefully a
neutral sound I will let you listen and
later on I will give you my resume I had
some problems fitting it here on the
mini DSP so take the samples always with
a little bit of a reservation don't take
them too seriously I compared back and
forth in reality it sounds a little bit
more refined but the general
characteristics is captured quite well I
think you can also check it out from my
database
I already included it compared against
some other headphones
I thought we'll compare it against a
biodynamic DT 250 which is a bit more
expensive 13 euros versus hundred years
but this is really studio glass it's
quite a neutral sounding one really nice
has some issues with left and right
which I showed in my video in my review
about it but I think it sounds a bit
better so let's have a listen
is it just a dream I love Amy and stop
my fantasies call to me you are in my
thoughts I never stray from the heart of
you to me
we can't
am i touching you I wanna feel
I think you could hear the bad dynamic
sounds considerably more neutral this
has some issue with treble it sounds
somehow grainy I would like to show you
some measurements I had some problems
fitting it here on these ears therefore
there is some slight left/right
imbalance you can see the left side has
less space which I didn't hear that much
in reality but obviously it shows up in
the measurement so I will average both
channels for left and right and you can
see the tendency is a rather flat
response but there is some problem with
revell especially this peak at 10
kilohertz also some other one at 5.5
maybe so this makes the headphone appear
a little bit mmm I'm not quite sure but
it's not really neutral I would like to
show you the measurement with my own
compensation so you will see the
measurement with the same compensation
that I use for my recordings because
this one was compensated with the
included file so let's overlay this one
and you can see this twelve peak at five
six kilos becomes even more pronounced
also the one at 10 kilohertz and this is
the biggest problem of this headphone
the travel is simply not smooth enough
it has some Peaks apart from that it's a
rather flat response there are some dips
and humps but I'm not that impressed
like this guy Purex
corrects I mean it's nice but it's
nothing I would be raving about because
of this strange grayness treble
graininess apart on that rather smooth
response but the trail is not my thing
so I definitely prefer the VP 250 here
which is much smoother much more neutral
overall so compared to my database
compared to some other ones I will try
to add new headphones when I have some
the meantime I think I included about
1213 headphones maybe 15 it was not my
plan to use this existing speaker
database for headphones but it would
cost me too much effort too much time
too much resources too much money to
create a completely new database just
for headphones so as it's not such an
effort to record headphones with the
existing playlist that I have I will
continue maybe
also headphones to my database within is
it's another story because they are not
that easy to record like headphones also
here and not that satisfied it sounds
slightly more refined so treble doesn't
have this this this I don't know this
brutal character but the overall sound
is I think captured really well so I
compared back and forth the headphone
sound with my recording and I think you
can recognize it well but compared to
the DP 250 you can definitely hear that
it doesn't sound that great so and not
that impressed me 400 euros not sure
about the price in dollars it's also ok
a but it's not definitely not one of the
best sounding yeah well that's to say
nothing here let me see they fold it
like this no wait how is it so the one
is folded like this the other one ah so
it's like this ok it's a bit smaller
yeah I hope this review on this short
overview yeah you could see it comes
also with this make this pouch you can
put it inside here I hope this was
helpful a little bit to give you an idea
about the sound of the Miki MC 250 a
newcomer not bad but definitely not
really overwhelming so I prefer a
smoother sound overall I think you could
hear travel just doesn't sound right you
especially hear this peak at 5 6
kilohertz which makes the sound simply
and also a peak at thank you notes
always gives you this graininess and
it's quite a narrow peak so it's not an
overly boosted treble like we have with
the VP 880 but there are some really
narrow Peaks which make it appear simply
too harsh yeah thanks all for watching
and see you the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
