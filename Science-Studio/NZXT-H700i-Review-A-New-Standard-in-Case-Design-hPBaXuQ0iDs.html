beautiful the H 700 I we have here is in
a way a successor to the H 440 which was
a previous large mid tower case from
NZXT you still buy it by the way kind of
look like a mini-fridge I didn't really
like that design very much
this design though much better in my
opinion save a few details that I would
personally change the next time around
we're gonna talk about all of the very
cool unique features about this case
especially the cable management at the
rear will go really in depth with that
and then we'll also follow this video up
with a build in this case we're gonna
put a white motherboard in here and try
to make this case just look as cohesive
as possible it already looks beautiful
without anything in it I can't wait to
throw in components that follow suit
with the color scheme let's start with
the dimensions first this is an H Series
case like I said so it's gonna be a bit
larger in total volume and then say the
s340 elite which I'll be comparing this
case to quite a bit this is about 23
centimeters wide just over 50
centimeters tall and about 50
centimeters deep it's constructed from
steel and tempered glass at the front
and weighs just over 12 kilograms
alright anything else really important
in here that we want to talk about not
really it's got the usual H Series fan
and radiator config so you can fit up to
three 120 milligrams of top along with
radiators or a space for that you also
get a removable tray up top which is
pretty cool as well and then at the
front you can fit this same config to
three 120mm fans or radiators and there
is a large space in the basement that
does span across the entire length of
the case for extra room you want to put
a radiator there maybe even a pump down
below and have those tubes run up you're
doing something like a hard line tubing
a build then this case is it definitely
suited for that there is a problem
though with the cable shroud we'll talk
about that later I'm not really a fan of
this I'm really I think it's a little
too ostentatious and can get in the way
of some very precious pipe routing you
can fit up to seven SSDs in here which i
think is pretty cool three of which will
be situated in the front of the case
somewhere they'll be exposed to the room
because two of those are on top of the
basement and one is in front of the
basement this is a similar config to the
s340 elite but the improvement here with
the
700 I is that the top to SSD trays are
modular in the sense that you can move
them pretty much anywhere you want along
these grooves atop the basement just
grip the lever on the right side of each
and you can well do whatever you want
here move them further towards the back
of the case or you can move them further
forward you can even rotate them
sideways you've been wanting really
fancy with it although just from a cable
mender standpoint keeping them roughly
where they are is the smartest way to go
there's also a harddrive shelf down
below which you can slide forward and
back depending on how big your power
supply is and how much room we need in
the front for cables radiators and
reservoirs you'll want to talk about
what else you get with the case there
are three included 120 millimeter AER
fans from NZXT in the front and there is
one 140 MLA or fans situated at the rear
but these are pretty cheap just at first
glance there's no rubber grooves
anywhere to mitigate the the sounds of
vibrations won't really be helped in any
sense here and I'm really disappointed
that despite this case having integrated
like an integrated RGB strip up top
which i think is really cool you don't
get the RGB fans the RGB AR fans from
NZXT with this case not that they would
you know do much at the front because of
the front panel is not transparent at
all but having one at the rear maybe
would be a nice touch just just
something to make it feel premium this
is a $200 case and getting some cheap
fans in this case is really
disappointing I would like to have seen
something nicer than what we're getting
with these fans here
despite the cheap fans though this case
doesn't look too bad from an airflow
perspective it has about an inch of
clearance between the front panel which
is not perforated and the chassis and
where the fans are mounted so decent
space for air to move in but again
laterally so we're not talking about air
flow moving directly in from the front
which is always going to impede your
cooler or your fans ability to pull in
air also on top of that this is going to
be a louder case because the air does
have to make such a sharp turn to enter
the the large space inside there is a
large dust filter up front that spans
all three fan slots it's magnetically
attached as well to the chassis which is
nice and there's a second dust filter
underneath the case protecting the power
supply there is no dust filter included
at the top of the case and these little
holes on the side aren't into a great
job of mitigating dust buildup
so only run an exhaust config at the top
of the case don't pull air in from the
top because really makes no sense anyway
right heat rises so run an intake set up
here at the front exhaust setup on the
top and a single exhaust fan at the rear
and you should be fine the slightly
negative pressure build up you'll have
in the case should be protected by the
dust filter up front the H 700 I does
have some subtleties that I would like
to point out however one of which is
included in the front
io config so there are two SB 2.0 ports
two USB 3.0 ports the standard you know
microphone headphone jack the power
button and these are attached to the
chassis by the way so you can remove the
entire top panel not have to worry about
dealing with cables attached to the case
and this front IO but the USB 3.0 hubs
are actually painted purple instead of
the typical blue color which is nice I
mean that's that's NZXT G's color scheme
anyway with purple white and black so
it's really nice to see that in this
case just a small thing a small detail
that they did not miss also there is a
cutout on top of the PSU shroud for
routing and gore VGA power cables so
that if you're worried about that it is
still there I'm glad that they included
that most cases nowadays are overlooking
that but this is something that I'm glad
to see still existing in NZXT cases
another cool feature they've included a
smart device which is what they're
calling it but it's basically a fan hub
/ RGB strip hub it's basically
everything all-in-one it's included with
the purchase of the case it better be
for 200 bucks and it all can be
controlled via cam software and a USB
2.0 connection to the motherboard so you
can control fans with this thing you can
control the colors of RGB strips and RGB
fans with this as long as they're
compatible and you can look all that up
on their website then it can all be
controlled via cam software which is
really cool it's all integrated it is
included with the case again like I said
it better be for 200 bucks or so but
it's it's already mounted actually to
the front of the case and they've done a
great job blending it in with the rest
of the design so they're just kind of
showing it off in the front which i
think is really cool now on to the one
thing that's really bugging me about
this case and it's pretty obvious it
might not be obviously that's bugging
you but it's bugging me a lot and it's
this stupid cable shroud like I get that
there's some functionality
- it like would blocking the cables
making it more difficult to connect your
24 pin to your motherboard that's I'm
sorry I'm really really not here but I
think this thing is just stupid and they
made it worse by making it more
prominent in the H 700 I also the
smaller variants of this case which are
also linked in the description
I get what they're trying to do here I
really do but it's it's just gonna get
in the way I think that it is just a
showpiece it's just like the the icon of
NZXT cases at this point they've made it
more defined it wraps around the entire
front side of the case and it's it's
just a nuisance it's a pain to work
around it's a pain to run cables through
I really think that they need to subdue
this somehow keep some sort of design
quality that makes an Indy XD case look
like an NZXT case sure but don't impede
my own building ability to make this
thing look the way you want it it's
really the only major concern I have
about this case that and maybe airflow
will run some tests but the the shroud
is just it's I really just see it as a
showpiece it sticks down like I would
say probably three or so inches and it
can it's just I don't know what it's
doing like what is it what is it doing
here some people like this design more
some people like the design of the s340
elite more I would lean more towards
that design from just a theme standpoint
but the functionality of the Aged 700 I
does trump the functionality of the s340
Elite they've done a lot more here at
the front they've done a lot more also
at the rear of the case on the right
side of the case which I want to talk
about next there's a lot going on back
here and it's mostly good stuff so to
remove the right panel all you gotta do
is push this button here at the rear
super easy to do just make sure you have
a hand there to catch the panel it will
fall once you push that button and you
just click it back into place once
you're finished with what you need to do
on that side very nice I think all cases
should follow this design I'd like to
see a bunch of different things kind of
mesh together from multiple companies
until one altima case this right here
this quality I want to see in every case
from NZXT from this point out now on to
some more good stuff you can see there
are a bunch of cable management guides
there's one big one here for the
rerouted cables from the front IO and
from the included hub you have space for
routing 24 pins you have your eighth and
EPS you can wrap do all kinds of crazy
stuff with you have two SSD trays that
are secured via single thumb screw and
plenty of tie straps to keep everything
else nice and tidy if you're willing to
remove the hard drive bay in the
basement you'll have plenty of space for
mounting a d5 modular pump which you can
then use to route piping up to the rest
of the components in the case and there
is plenty of space on top of the
basement that little cutout in the front
there
for squeezing odd not only a radiator a
thin radiator at that but it's still got
the space for it and the tubing
necessary to mount a pump down there
that was an issue I had with other cases
where like the cutout would only be
enough for a fan and radiator config but
the space between that and the end of
the cut out where the basement begins on
top would be too small to to route
tubing so it's nice to see the extra
space here you can put a thicker rad or
you can put tubing here instead
so there's nearly an inch of cable
management space on this right side and
that's that's more than enough not only
that but you got the grooves you've got
the tie straps this should be a breeze
to throw any sort of modular or even non
mantra to power supply and here you
could stuff cables down below especially
if you're willing to remove the hard
drive bay and then the rest of it you
can reroute very cleanly up to the ports
on your motherboard and elsewhere look
I'm really like in this case a few
things keeping me from just going all in
on it including the price including the
stupid shroud I'm sorry I just don't
like it I just I thought it was
interesting looking at first it's like
oh that's obviously an NZXT case but
then why when I started looking at like
just how its how its integrated and what
it's actually supposed to do I I I just
don't like it I don't like there's
enough space between the the motherboard
tray and the start of the shrouds your
cables are going to be squished as
always they were that way in the sv40 as
well and I just don't like how much
space there is between this and the top
panel I just it just looks weird that's
that's all it just looks a little weird
to me and I'm just removing it makes
things look so empty in here so they
need to do something but they don't need
to do this
this is the one architectural issue I
have with the H 700 enough to prevent me
from recommending this case no it's not
I still think it's a really nice case I
think it's overpriced yeah and you can
say oh well they included an RGB strip
and a Smart Hub and whatever okay you
want to compare this price to the
previous aged 440 price it's just it's
slightly overpriced for what you're
getting and I think that an sv40 elite
will serve the same purpose basically
with the exception of additional water
cooling support but then again this is
really gonna bother you if your water
cooler this is like right in the way of
everything if you want to route tubing
from your CPU block maybe to a radiator
up top or up front this stupid thing is
just gonna get in the way it's the one
issue I have with it again and it's the
only thing keeping me from just going
all-in and wanting to build a custom
loop in the age 700 I so I've got some
raw opinions yeah but they're just that
their opinions and I've been building in
several several cases throughout the
years and this one is it's not the best
it's really not considering there's so
much space in here to work with
it feels limited by the cable shroud
just does what do you think let me know
in the comments below if you want to see
a build in this it'll be sure to if I
don't know do do something I'd like the
video that'd be cool like the video or
you can just dislike it for whatever
reason no I'm just kidding I'm gonna
build in this case anyway stay tuned for
that you can find the product
description and the info where to buy
this thing in the video description I
think as of right now is of the
uploading date and publishing into this
video you can only buy tan NZXT each
website but it is coming soon to new egg
and amazon stay tuned for those those
links will be available once you can
actually buy this case from those
marketplaces be sure to click the
