rising pcs this video will be short and
sweet and as the title explains will
seek to solve the mystery involving and
for UEFI s you see with Intel this
hasn't lately been a concern when sky
and KB families hit the shelves
motherboard manufacturers already loaded
up their fine-tuned firmware Ergo
performance jumps from subsequent BIOS
updates were minimal and they're
typically not suggested unless you have
a serious problem with the motherboard
at hand but with Verizon things are a
bit backwards and you can thank AMD for
that not the motherboard manufacturers
in fact one anonymous motherboard rep
went off about how AMD didn't alot
enough time for these manufacturers to
procure the firmware necessary to
extract the full potential of rising
CPUs what we ended up with was a messy
launch plagued with RAM frequency issues
but still persist by the way overclock
limitations and as you'll see shortly
framerate disparities so what I did was
test two different motherboards with my
AMD are seven 1700 X the first the ax
370 gaming K seven gigabytes finest am4
board the second was the asrock X 370
Taichi I ran the same GTA 5 benchmark
with the same presets before and after
the BIOS update the starting BIOS is
used where the ones that shipped on
launch day around February 11th or so
the second batch of BIOS is flashed were
these here the latest releases as of
March 25th other specifications include
a single gtx 1070 from EVGA running its
stock 16 gigabytes of ddr4 24 hundred
megahertz plugging any higher still
rather sketchy on the gigabyte board
even with 2 dims installed vs. 4 and a
cpu frequency of 3.9 gigahertz which
most should be able to obtain with a
1700 X and a decent cooler now it's off
to the races the gigabyte board is up
first on the f2 BIOS the minimum frame
rate was 75 averaging to just under 102
FPS with the latest BIOS f3 be my
framerate actually fell to 69 on the
minimum side and only 98 on average now
if you're wondering whether this falls
into the margin of error don't worry you
aren't alone so I retested after
flashing back to the f2 BIOS only to
find this the same minimum that's the
previous f2 run and a 1 FPS difference
on average so in gigabytes case it's
safe to say that FPS and GT 5 decrease
as a result of the latest BIOS update
but let's test to be as rock board I
should mention and they didn't tell me
to say this by the way they've been
doing an excellent job staying on top of
their firmware updates so typically find
a large list of you afi's to choose from
development it's almost never a
disappointment here now in the earliest
BIOS I received these results 65 on the
low side 95 on average these scores are
lower than both of our gigabyte runs but
there's more to the story after updating
to the latest firmware version 1.6 for
the Taichi FPS increased by nearly 20
percent across the board 76 for the
minimum 110 on average here are the four
scenarios on the same graph
so what does this mean if you have a
rise in CPU obviously a rising
motherboard I recommend staying on top
of those motherboard firmware updates
you never know one could come along that
can drastically change your gaming
performance that's how it is going to be
for these rise in CPUs especially our
five CPUs you'll start to see things
really turn around for Rison five
once these bios's are refined so I
recommend staying on top of those don't
update to the latest firmware
automatically I do recommend checking
other sides before doing that making
sure that the babies have confirmed that
that BIOS is a good BIOS and one that
you do want to download and flash but
for now at least keep on top of what is
being released for your motherboard
because a lot of people will just
install the board install the CPU and
just move on from there
but when you'll find that as these
motherboard biases roll out as they're
being refined time and time again you'll
be able to overclock your RAM a bit more
you'll be able to overclock CPU a bit
more you might even just incur a few
extra frames simply from the PI update
itself which can have a huge impact on
the operating system stability things
like that which we're not used to seeing
on the intel slide because well with
intel releases lately motherboard
manufacturers have had much more time to
prepare those UEFI s before the initial
launch of those CPUs so all that to say
this reisen's still a bit shaky I still
can't hit three thousand megahertz on my
gigabyte board where workability is
sketchy at best
temperatures are almost always
inaccurate and as we've verified here
yet another variable can impact gaming
performance we can play the blame game
all you'd like but the fact of the
matter is things aren't quite there yet
for the red team I'm seeing it firsthand
with red sky my new editing rig boasting
a 1700 X I'm all-in when what's left of
the hype and I'm impatiently waiting for
further updates I'm not on the AMD witch
hunt I don't care what's in my system I
can't see the processor in my system I
only care about two things performance
and value AMD can win it especially with
Rison 5 but the kings need to be worked
out first shouldn't be too long now
although if you're wondering I still do
stand by my statement regarding rising 5
and the Intel i5 lineups that are made
right here my bet that makes you cringe
inside you like this video be sure to
give it a thumbs up thumbs done for the
opposite be sure click subscribe if you
haven't already and we'll catch you in
the next video where I review the LG G 6
is about
the s8 well no but should you still
consider it hell yes this is sell is our
studio thanks for learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
