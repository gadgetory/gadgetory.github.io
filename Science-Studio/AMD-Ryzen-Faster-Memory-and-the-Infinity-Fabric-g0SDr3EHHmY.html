Rison there was a ton of discussion
regards to using higher clocked system
ram particularly in games the
performance benefits of having higher
clock memory was something that we
didn't necessarily see an Intel side
it's just not now the architecture is
made it's not made to benefit from
higher clock memory but rise ins
architecture is and that's what I want
to talk about in this video if it's
worth buying really expensive high clock
RAM out of the box for the sake of a
rise in CPU and a lot of the people who
spend you know 400 bucks on an 1800 X
are probably gonna buy a higher clock to
rise in memory anyway at least a memory
that's capable of reaching 3000 or 3,200
maker it's on the rise in platform which
is difficult to do we'll talk about that
as well but for those who are in the
mid-range Rison five-tier should you
still consider fast memory and why does
it even matter in the first place I talk
about all that in this video now when it
comes down to it all rise in CPUs on a
fabrication level are basically the same
there are a few imperfections in some of
the cores and that is ultimately
differentiates a rise in three cpu from
a rise in seven cpu so of the eight
cores that are packed into every Rison
chip no matter if you have a rise in
three up to Horizon seven CPU if four of
those aren't doing too well then AMD is
gonna just disable and they're just
gonna turn them off it's better than
making an entirely new fabrication
process for a four core chip this way
they can save money makes perfect sense
I don't blame them for doing that so a
before remaining course if these can
handle power loads pretty well and the
the performance degradation isn't too
substantial then these might be arisin
five 1400s or 1500 X's if they aren't
doing too well with handling a lot of
power and the schedulers aren't doing
that great a job at increasing the
performance level then they might be
rising three CPUs with multi-threading
and disabled so it really comes down to
what AMD deems as acceptable on both
power delivery and execution levels now
the difference between AMD and Intel
because Intel does this too with bidding
is that AMD decides well if these four
cores aren't going to cut it we're gonna
disable two of the cores in one cc X
which is a four core cluster in a Rison
CPU and two cores in the other CC X
which is the other cluster of
horizon CPU every rise in CPU has to CC
x's per die the red Ripper has four
which is why you can get up to 16 cores
in those CPUs maybe this diary shot will
help explain things a bit better so if
two cores are activated in one cc X and
two are activated in the other there has
to be some sort of efficient way for
them both to communicate because these
are essentially two separate dies they
might not be that physically but each
core cluster has an own set of resources
including l3 cache which means that when
you're in especially intense situations
on a computational level and they have
to share information and process
information simultaneously and exchange
resources there has to be an efficient
Highway a way for data to be transferred
super quick between the cores to
eliminate that latency this highway is
called the Infinity fabric as Tom's
Hardware puts it the large amount of
data flowing through this pathway
requires a lot of scheduling magic to
ensure a high quality of service it's
also logical to assume that these six
and four core models benefit from less
cross CCX traffic compared to the eight
core models
so they're actually hinting at here is
the dual CCX design is a blessing in a
way and a curse it's a blessing for AMD
from a financial standpoint because all
they have to do is slap multiple CC exes
into the same chip and just run infinity
fabric all between them which saves them
money because they can control how many
CC exes are in each dial without
completely redoing the fabrication
process but the curse involved is the
latency involved between the CC X data
transfers so the Infinity fabric itself
is not the most efficient means by which
data is transferred from one CC X to
another this is where the faster memory
comes into play it's but this whole
video is about why rise and benefits
from faster memory we hear people say
that maybe they don't know what they're
talking about but they are correct in a
sense it really depends on the number of
cores enabled per cc X but ultimately
Rison will benefit more from faster
memory than Intel will and the reason
why is because the Infinity fabrics
speed this the rate at which it can
transfer data is directly tied to the
frequency of your system memory Intel is
independent on the same variable because
their consumer-grade CPUs are reliant on
the ring bus design two rings share
information between let's say 4 cores
and basically you have less traffic
being dispatched between cores so the
the congestion isn't as great as it
would be on an 8-core Rison cpu because
then you have four cores trying to share
information down let's say a single
pathway with the Infinity fabric so
there can be quite a bit of congestion
and lag I shouldn't say lag it's more or
less a gamer term but latency it's the
delay in data transfer and we see a huge
difference between the rain bus design
with Intel a comparable Intel CPU and
the Infinity fabric whereas cores on an
i7 7 700 K rely on the latency roughly
between 30 and 40 nanoseconds cross
quartic or latency on a cc x-ray for
Horizon is somewhere in the realm of 200
nanoseconds almost 10 times the latency
just because data has to be transferred
across an infinity fabric not to be
frank we're talking nanoseconds here not
even milliseconds but it does add up
over time as huge computational
workloads bottleneck that infinity
fabric you can imagine how things get
pretty backed up in the long run and you
might even be able to tell a difference
in things like games and also in render
times if you do have heavy workloads
being pushed to rise in CPUs they might
not be able to handle them as well with
that lower clocked system Ram so there
you have it yes AMD rice and CPUs do
benefit from higher clock memory it's
not a myth and the reason why is because
AMD employs infinity fabric which is
directly dependent on the speed of your
RAM now getting too much into detail
that's really all you need to know
something else worth noting is that rise
in 3cp is because they only have two
cores activated per CCX aren't going to
benefit as much from the higher clocked
Ram only because the data transfer rates
between CC X's are going to be as high
because only two cores per CC X are
actually sending information whereas in
horizon 7 1700 700 X or 800 X CPU get
four cores on each side sending a ton of
information things can get pretty
congested in there for more info on this
maybe you'd like to read an article
about the Infinity fabric I invite you
to check out the link at the top this
video's description sometimes it helps
to just read something over and over
until it clicks each it takes me 5 or 6
times I'm like I'm like you're bringing
the sentence until till something clicks
you get that light bulb go off now ok I
get it now
it's harder to do that with a
videocassette to keep hearing me say it
over and over again it's less annoying
when you're doing it yourself in your
head and invite you to check that link
out by the way it's linked to Tom's
hardware and they have a great article
breaking down the Infinity fabric and
why it behaves the way it does also is a
pretty cool benchmarks in there to back
up the claims made in this video if you
like this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up I appreciate it thumbs down
