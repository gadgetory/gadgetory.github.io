family has been super awesome they've
let us borrow their lift we're going to
replace the stock exhaust on the audi s5
with an aftermarket kit this is an army
Tricks exhaust kit made specifically for
the s5 2012
era and that's all it right there we're
going to tear it all down and we're
going to raise this thing up swap
everything out should be at the most of
two parts series we've got an exhaust
clip before we're going to do one after
obviously with the valves open and
closed a lot of cool things involved
with this particular kit here that's why
I wanted army tricks in the first place
so without further ado let's get to
swapping and alright we got the car
lifted we are in the process of
attaching the downpipe from the headers
I know you really cannot see that at all
see if I can brighten things up a bit
there you go so there is the down pipe
and now we're moving the three bolts in
the back here connecting that tube to
the header above that so awkward angles
oh how the heck we're going to get this
one off on top but we're going to
engineer it alright this is the stock
exhaust kit all the way up to down pipes
as you can see everything is welded
there are no bolts anywhere so it just
was one big piece that we just took out
the big pain big thanks to Justin and
his uncle for most of the man work there
and it's empty and it's dark sorry
we're going to put the new kit in place
of the old one
Justin you're now an official unboxer
from science studio China did you do it
here I'm not gonna lie that up on one
part up there just a little tiny bit all
right so that is the that's the layout
right there mufflers assuming that the
resonator down light
and typically residence parking spots
where we go back that right there
one last scroll through here underneath
everything looks ugly and old except for
the exhaust kit now
again all the way up to the headers
starting with the down pipe
working our way back I'm going to lower
her and wire in the vacuum hoses that
open and close the valves and the
mufflers you can pull it through the
hood or just tuck it up like in that
little section for the left
then you get a little key fob here for
opening and closing the valve I'll put
this somewhere on the car because I'm a
fanboy
from cold start we found any different
hi
and broken
