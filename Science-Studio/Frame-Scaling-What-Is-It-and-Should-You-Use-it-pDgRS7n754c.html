specific reason I will explain that here
shortly so what its frame scaling its
ascending gta5 is boasted for quite a
while and mimics down sampling or up
sampling depending on which way you tune
it these essentially force your GPU to
render a resolution higher or lower than
that of your monitor while on paper this
may not make much sense since you can't
change the number of pixels your screen
both up and down sampling have very
relevant purposes in today's gaming
industry to touch briefly on down
sampling and why you might want to use
it let's say you have a hundred and
twenty Hertz monitor and obviously one
to four hundred twenty frames but you're
only getting about seventy to eighty in
game with the current settings that you
have if you have texture sets very high
you have shadow sets very high and those
are things you don't like compromise on
then you can actually tweak the scaling
counter down to say 0.5 like you can in
GTA and keep those in game settings up
while increasing your framerate now I
must warn you down sampling can look
especially bad at resolutions
approaching 50% scaling like you're
seeing here 100% being native resolution
in some cases you might actually be
better off lowering textural detail etc
but it's still nice inclusion especially
for a game of dynamic at GTA 5 you can
play around with both settings and see
which one you like the best if you're a
baller on a budget I'd consider it if
games offer this feature you can
actually scale up or down within your
Nvidia and AMD control panels as well if
you're down for a more universally
scaled experience with more or less
stability now chances are if the game
offers a down sampling feature that'll
also offer an up sampling one and this
is where things can get dicey especially
for those who have decent hardware ergo
maybe an i5 or i7 with maybe a gtx 1070
or 1080 on AMD side arisin seven chip
and maybe a few reacts you get a point
you can interchange all of those but if
you spend a lot of money on your
hardware you want your game to look
decent and that's where frame scaling
can really throw people off especially
for not willing to just sit down and
look at things and compare them
side-by-side so that's what I'm going
for you in this video with this kind of
horsepower you can most certainly take
advantage of frame scaling but what
exactly does it do to the image on
screen is it even worth it here's where
the 4k video makes a bit of sense
you see YouTube compresses the living
hell out of video especially in 1080p so
in 4k I can preserve a bit more of my
well bit rate this means you'll likely
see a bigger difference between the two
frames I'm about to show you on the left
native 1440p resolution or x one frame
scaling on the right to the highest
frame
scanning resolution possible within GTA
5 x 2.5 putting us well beyond the
resolution of 4k or Ultra HD to be more
specific now I know what you're thinking
Greg these look identical and
unfortunately that's the trend here on
my end as well to be completely honest
if it wasn't for the stark framerate
difference I'd have gotten the mixed up
on screen and that's the trend
throughout these scenes even zoomed in
you'll have a very difficult time
telling them apart the native scaling
looks a bit more grainy and noisy as one
might expect but I wouldn't say it's
worth the insane framerate dip think of
upscaling is sort of like increasing
your bitrate you're not changing your
resolution per se but you are making
things look a bit more fluid and sharp
to a degree we don't see much of that
here we literally went from 130 to 60
fps by the way and that's on to GTX 10
80s at 2 gigahertz apiece putting this
165 Hertz monitor to shame I've heard
quite a lot of hype in regard to frame
upscaling of our anti-aliasing but I
have to say at this point I'm convinced
of the opposite I recently ran a bunch
of anti-aliasing test within GTA 5 for
the minute science playlist and I must
say I do prefer anti-aliasing over
upscaling at least with these settings
and this game another reason why I'd
suggest staying away going back to what
we just mentioned the performance hit
blue sky struggled big-time with the
250% scaling and for that small of a
clarity bump you can imagine how
indistinguishable these smaller jumps
are the framerate dip wasn't as bad and
neither where the frame rates here but
I'd still recommend pushing AAA settings
before tweaking without scaling in
anyway again take what I've said in this
video with a grain of salt I'm speaking
from my own experience and with my own
gear but with that said if you've got
solid hardware and a monitor with a
crazy high refresh rate I strongly
recommend sticking with the fps over
marginal Johnson graphical clarity and
if that doesn't suit your fancy play
around with anti-aliasing first if you
liked this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
click and subscribe but if you haven't
already I will catch you in the next
video where at review the gigabytes a X
370 gaming k7 Rison motherboard we're
going to use that in our custom loop
build anyway this will sell as our
