the channel that a core i7 is the best
solution for content creators but you
don't need something like a 69 50 X or
even a 59 30 K or any other CPU
compatible with the x99 chipset all you
truly need if you plan on editing and
rendering in 1080p and even 4k is a core
i7 6700 K now that's not to say that
these other processors won't do well
they'll do much better in fact than the
6700 K but if you ask me the 6700 K is
the best bang for the buck content
creation CPU out there but what about
gaming should those who only ever game
on the computers consider a core i7 I
suppose we could boil this question down
to does hyper-threading really make that
much of a difference with modern
triple-a titles it would only make sense
in this regard to compare the 6700 K to
the 6600 K essentially a core i7 without
hyper threading and slightly less cache
so let's tackle the question then core
i7 for gaming yes or no
to answer this question we'll be running
through the classic gaming benchmark
routine using my own personal rig it's
packing 16 gigabytes of Gil's super
loose ddr4 clock to 3000 megahertz a
single GTX 1074 may soothe running its
stock and a captain 240 EXA i/o cooler
from deep cool to ensure that both of
these chips stay nice and cool went
under load both the 6600 K and 6700 K
will be overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz at
1.3 volts so this is a frequency that
almost everyone should be able to obtain
with both of these chips and a decent
cooler
I will also be running all of these
tests at a resolution of 2560 by 1440
since any higher would unfairly leverage
the CPU and any lower would result in
nearly identical frame rates as I've
already proven with the Haswell lineup
right here so along with the benchmarks
you're about to see I've also included
peak CPU usages for each game so you can
get an idea of which are predominantly
CPU intensive I tested eight games in
total four which were run in DirectX 12
mode alright I think I've covered
everything so let's see how the i-5
compares to the i7 the results might
surprise you just just a little bit
first up GTA 5 when I like to use a
solid blend of both CPU and GPU
intensive segments but the differences
between two processors in a scenario
even with everything maxed out on the
regular graphics tab including MSA two
times eight we're barely discernible the
i-5 did have a bit of trouble towards
the end hence the dips here and here but
overall real-world performance is
indistinguishable now let's move on to a
first-person shooter in the case of
black ops 3 again not much of a
difference in fact it was the i-5 that
pulled ahead slightly in both minimums
and averages but one frame is within the
margin of error and it wouldn't really
make sense for an i-5 to do better than
an i7
so a four game like this and i-5 is
clearly at your best bet csgo believe it
or not showed very similar tendencies
the i-5 actually pulled much further
ahead of the i7 which really doesn't
make sense in its own right and being
that we can't just like test both of
these identically this leads me to
assume that csgo could care less really
whether your quad-core CPU has
hyper-threading on board or not but what
about super CPU intensive games like
City skylines we should notice a
difference here right well yeah actually
we do there is a difference here about 6
frames on average however something to
definitely consider in a case like this
is price is i7 performance in a game
like this worth an extra
six frames no not when we're talking
about a 100 US dollar Delta so now let's
move into directx12 territory we've all
been told once or twice a DirectX 12
leverages multiple CPU lanes more
efficiently than the DirectX 11 meaning
in theory the i7 should have an edge but
with the rise of the Tomb Raider that is
definitely not the case at least to any
noticeable degree we're hovering around
the margin of error across the board so
not looking too great for the i7 at this
point but alas there is still hope and I
will admit all three games you're about
to see did in fact benefit from the
added threads q total war Warhammer not
only business game support DirectX 12
albeit in beta but it's also very CPU
dependent and it shows the i7 picked up
eight additional frames on average 15
when it came to Max's and even three on
the minimum side I would regard these as
statistically significant expect to see
even wider margins with things like
anti-aliasing pushed up even further
than what it was already at on the ultra
preset hitman tells a similar story we
see a nine frame boost on average
difference you could arguably see
on-screen lashley ashes of the
singularity solidifies the fact that yes
in a few cases the i7 is a clearly
better gaming performer especially at
lower frame rates like these five fps
can make a huge difference but is it
substantial enough to justify the much
higher price tag so here's the part I
didn't tell you and this might actually
help you make up your mind between the
two while I was benchmarking all of
these games with both processors I was
also streaming Pandora music in the
background watching youtube videos on
science Studios page and also recording
every single benchmarking scenario with
shadow play I was trying so hard to help
out the i7 here trying to make a case
even if it meant the most dire situation
but still the i-5 60 600k trucked along
and hesitated only under the most
rigorous of tasks even when CPU usage
was pegged above 90% which was under
most cases by the way during some of
these benchmarks frame rates did not dip
gameplay remains smooth and the overall
computing experiences during both
overload sessions were literally
indistinguishable so even if you plan on
streaming live to twitch or recording
yourself the webcam while gaming chances
are the i-5 will pack more than enough
punch for what you plan to do so long of
course as you're willing to compromise
on a few frames here and there if you've
got a beefy graphics card to back it up
CPU choice should be rather
straightforward for heavy gamers
five sixty 600k save the i7 for busy
content creators and 3d modelers all you
need are four powerful cores that's it a
solid GPU and a decent cooling system
save yourself a hundred or so bucks or I
don't know buy something like a keyboard
something you'll actually benefit from
be like we saw in this video be sure to
give it a thumbs up give it a thumbs
down if you like but opposite or to hate
