sending us to Computex 2019 what is
going on everyone we are here in Taipei
for Computex 2019 this is probably the
first video you're gonna see from us
regarding Computex coverage and we're
gonna kick things off with obviously AMD
stuff because wow you guys are all over
this and I don't really blame you so I
have a lot of stuff pulled up on my
phone here I'm gonna be a tional II
looking and referencing it because
there's a lot of stuff to go through
but I want to stock start first with the
CPUs of themselves just so we get a
baseline what we're gonna be working
with now and talk about what we expect
to come out very soon especially at the
16 core rise the 9 CPS we're expecting
here so starting first with a rise in
five we have a 3,600 at 6 cores 12
threads boost frequency of 4.2 gigahertz
three Meg's of l2 cache 32 megabytes of
l3 cache and then we have the risin 5
3600 X just a higher boost frequency
essentially and that's a 95 watt chip
rise and 7 goes up to the 3700 X that's
8 cores 16 threads 4.4 gigahertz boost
frequency this is definitely higher than
what we're familiar with regarding Zen
and Zen plus horizon 7 3800 X 8 cores 16
threads 4.5 gigahertz boost frequency of
that jumps up to 105 watts so that's a
bit higher and then rise in 9 3900 X 12
cores 24 threads a 4.6 gigahertz boost
frequency I remember this isn't talking
about all cores so you won't have an all
core 4.6 8 gigahertz boost frequency you
could certainly manually overclock if
you wanted we're not sure how good
overclockers these chips are gonna be
but 4.6 on any core for anything named
Rison is a big step in the right
direction because we've been limited to
pretty much around 4 or 4.1 maybe 4
point 2 gigahertz for at least 1 or 2
cores with Zen plus and then Zen the
original Zen Rison 1000 was if you were
lucky 4 gigahertz now we're reading the
price I don't think the price is too bad
I haven't seen many people talk about
the price for the most part they've been
fairly positive about the $4.99 price
tag and I think you just have to look at
this in a macro sense right 12 cores and
a mainstream consumer grade CPU is
unheard of
I'm gonna throw up this graphic here and
this one's very interesting to me again
you gotta take these things with pretty
large handful of salt when we're talking
about you know industry tests
this is probably something that a.m.
he's trying to make look better for
themselves I would say this if I didn't
tell I would say this about NVIDIA it
doesn't matter what company it is I
would wait for third-party reviews
before you start you know spewing this
is gospel but when you talk about IPC
which is something that Intel is
dominated for a long time we've got a
graphic here showing that be 3,700 X
pretty much neck and neck with a 9700
Ches IPC 1,900 keg and this is gonna be
a better bench if overall it's why it's
slightly higher IPC than that plus two
percent and then three percent for the
3800 X again we don't know for sure
we're gonna be running many tests at the
exact same frequencies in the future to
show you guys what you're getting per
clock but this is this is really good
news it becomes this close maybe within
two or three percent of Intel I will be
just as happy and I would gladly play
pay five hundred bucks for a 12 core 24
thread trip like that especially on a
consumer-grade platform now you're going
to need a very beefy chipset to handle
all the new features including PCI for
including power delivery and the x5 70
chipset is what I want stalk about next
we're in the gigabytes suite case you're
wondering and there are plenty of boards
in that direction and they are all being
occupied by other media so let's try to
find our way in there at some point I'll
but you'll see some shots here in a
second and yeah these boards are looking
really good from gigabyte I'm going to
talk about some of x-5 seventies
features next now what you're looking at
here is the x5 70 horas extreme one of
the best five seventy boards that
gigabyte has to offer and this is a
direct 16 phase motherboard here so the
power delivery up top no doubling it is
purely sixteen individual phases feeding
that CPU and that's pretty incredible
that also tells us a lot about power
draw for rise into or Zen to ever you
want to call it rise in 3000 you can see
we have two dedicated a pin EPS ports up
top whenever you see something like this
we saw this with X 299 that means that
when you manually overclock these CPUs
they are going to pull some powers that
don't be surprised also you'll notice
that most X 570 chipsets have dedicated
fans are usually pretty small but this
one doesn't have that fan because the
entire AHA this entire plate here is
made out of metal so that conducts a lot
of the heat and passively radiates up to
the atmosphere also a heat pipe extends
connects that to the to the North vrm
Finn stack and I like seeing individual
Finn's here's something gigabyte did a
while back with I believe the original
x3 70 boards that they had and now we're
seeing the fence stacks again with VR
I'm cooling here on the X 570 so good to
see that it's stuck around and I will
definitely come in handy especially when
manually overclocking and I'm sure
you've heard it a lot PCIe gen3 the
bandwidth of PCIe gen3 so this is a 2
terabyte drive here you're looking at
from gigabyte and this course using an
nvme interface you could raid these and
that would almost double your
performance I'm actually running a raid
0 config in my personal rig right now
and it's been pretty stable and then
check this out this right here has four
of those nvme drives packed into that
exceeds in the PCIe slot and this is a
full 16 lane card like this with this
will saturate a full 16 lanes and
because they have 4 these cards in here
in raid and C theoretical reads and
writes up to 15,000 megabytes per second
so I'm not sure if you guys really care
at all about transfer speeds but if you
want some of the best out there at least
on consumer grade hardware and this
would definitely be it it is very heavy
very sleek looking looks very good
requires active cooling and I'm sure
it's gonna cost an arm and a leg maybe
looking for something nice and compact
you have X 570 eye or s pro Wi-Fi you
guys love ITX builds this is for you
they told me that this is going to be
very overclockable so you should expect
similar overclocking performance with
this as you would in some of their
beefier boards thanks to eight discrete
phases and then you have an 8 layer
thick PCB nuts kind of you guys to see
but this is an ultra thick PCB here so
you can do a lot more with the board
when you have eight different layers to
run those copper traces and that's
pretty impressive
again active cooling here pretty much
every board except for the one we showed
you earlier that extreme board so active
cooling over the chipset underneath that
and then we have a very beautiful check
out the backside here built in IO shield
so at this point it's pretty easy to
speculate and assume that AMD is just
going to take everything over and force
Intel to walk with its tail between its
legs for a good two or so years at least
until whatever they're working on
ten nanometers actually comes to
fruition because that's been delayed
many times and we still have an Intel
shortage of current 40 nanometers stuff
thanks to the fact that their
manufacturing chipsets and CPUs on the
same fab so it's not looking great for
Intel at this point and I'm sure any
somewhat cognizant tech tuber will tell
you that but here's where I get just a
little apprehensive and I want to bring
this up because it's a trend that I've
noticed when I've talked with some
ministry reps and I'm not really sure
what to take away from it all because
AMD for the past three or four years has
been pushing higher core count chips
that is they're trying to make hike or
count chips as mainstream as possible
and that's perhaps one of the reasons
why is n ins m+ weren't great
overclockers relatively speaking I mean
if you could hit four or four point two
gigahertz of great but Intel setting
five right and that's one of the reasons
why they perform so much better in games
because games are still largely quad
maybe hexa-core dependent so you know
the difference between a 1600 and a 1700
rise in CPU isn't much when it comes to
frame rates and that's because games for
the most part don't effectively utilize
eight threads and well I said eight
threads what I mean is eight cores 16
threads in the case of SMT so Mike my
question and what I'm looking forward to
in 2019 2020 is how many developers in
both the the creative side as well as
the gaming side are really going to take
advantage of 12 cores or 16 cores for
that matter let's assume we're talking
about 16 cores already we know what's
coming right that second triplet there
was a blank space there and we know that
that's what this is basically resulting
in is a 12 core and now a 16 core CPU 32
threads in a consumer-grade ship
incredible but is it really going to be
worth it for gamers are the programs and
the games you're going to be using on
your system really going to be able to
utilize 16 cores I mean let alone 16
threads but you have 32 threads there in
that case 24 threads in the case of the
3900 X that's just that's mind-boggling
to me and what I'm curious to know and
find out in the next year or two is
whether or not
AMD's expectations regarding higher
count dependencies actually do end up
playing out in the real world so I wanna
know what you guys think about 12 core
CPUs 16 core CPUs mainstream consumer
grade is it something you would consider
and if so why I want you to justify it
that's really the key here it's easy to
say oh yeah I've got a really nice 12
core CPU but I really only utilize six
pores you know and twelve threads but
but I have 12 cores if I need them is it
something you're really going to be able
to use can you justify it trying to do
so in the comments section below
if you if you stream you do whatever and
you think you're gonna be able utilize
that much then sure but this is
something that I'm curious about and I
for my own uses I mean it's it's tough
to find especially with AMD nowadays
programs that will saturate the full
core up of core lineup so yeah well only
we'll have to wait and find out this is
kind of a weird spot to film but I
wanted to end this video outside cuz it
was very loud indoors you guys have been
awesome and yet this is hopefully gonna
be our first video I'll upload this
today and then we have plenty of stuff
to show you guys from the netting
exhibition hall and then the Grand Hyatt
Hotel plenty of sweets with some show
weed offerings stay tuned for that stuff
you guys been awesome thanks for
watching this is science studio thanks
for learning with us
