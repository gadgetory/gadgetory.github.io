you have a bit more insight into my
personal life most of you there know
that I've already graduated my
engineering degree and right now I'm
currently working on my masters in
Business Administration it's a
concentration in finance in particular
and in my first semester I actually took
a course on micro economic theory and
there I learned a bit more about the
perfect competition model which is what
I want to talk about this video
regarding graphics cards in a nutshell
perfect competition is defined by five
assumptions the first is that market
consists of many buyers the second
requirement is that the market consists
of many sellers three the firm's that
sell in the market are free to either
enter or exit the market at any time the
fourth requirement is that the goods
sold by the sellers in the market are
assumed to be homogeneous in this case
it's a particular good at two graphics
cards and we'll assume that the multiple
GPU variants and slight clock speed
deviations are that are homogeneous and
number five buyers and sellers in the
market are assumed to have perfect
information this means that all
resources and pricing strategies are
known by all buyers and sellers in the
market now obviously the buyers in this
market are us we are the consumers we
want the graphics cards it doesn't
matter what we intend to use those
graphics cards for could be gaming
mining content creation the purpose of
the purchase is irrelevant the fact is
we are in the market to purchase
graphics cards when interest in ether
Speight that's the popular online
currency so many are mining nowadays
aetherium graphics card demand spiked in
particular rx for 80s for 70s 5 80s and
5 70s and GTX 10 60s 10 70s and 10 80s
pretty much every mid to high range
graphics card on the market all
skyrocketed and demand older cards
including the r9 390 also flew off the
dusty shelves of retired PC gamers so we
the buyers created this bubble most of
us understand the basic supply demand
structure as demand shifts to the right
equilibrium price rises but this video
will seek to dive much deeper into the
matter what essentially happens here
what happened with the graphics card
market was that the perfect competition
model was broken turned upside down from
our 5 rules rule number two was broken
while
the initial supply of graphics cards was
arraign from new egg and amazon
warehouses among other places the market
was no longer perfectly competitive and
if we assume rule 1 was maintained which
we can directly verify with the jump in
second hand graphics card sales from
sites like eBay and Craigslist what
we're left with is a graphics card
market at temporary disequilibrium our
perfect model assumed that the market
would quickly converge to a single
acceptable price for our x5 80s and GTX
1060 s that was somewhere in the low to
mid 200s when demand shifted that price
increased but the market was still in
equilibrium at least until supply was
dried up something else to mention this
is a shift in demand and not a slide
along the original curves since demand
increased for all prices when either
interest spiked case in point I sold an
old rx 470 on eBay for 420 US dollars I
purchased it at Best Buy for a hundred
and eighty only a few months earlier in
rudimentary courses were taught that
supply and demand curves are actually
straight lines this in fact is not the
case they're called curves for a reason
at lower quantities supply tends to be
elastic mean that small changes in price
will yield a greater response in the
quantity provided but when demand curves
shift as a result of sudden interest
spikes required supply is shoved into
inelastic territory where small product
quantity changes yield enormous price
disparities this is because suppliers
have difficult times scaling up
production
conversely demand shifts leftward need
only for suppliers to stockpile
inventory now I've got in the long run
but slower to manifest from a price
perspective in the short run as a result
we're left with an awkward supply demand
plot by this point you might be thinking
this is some sort of market shortage
right so suppliers like EVGA gigabyte a
soos pretty much any graphics card
manufacturer or rebrand or out there is
short on supply so the reason why we
have such high prices is because we
don't have enough graphics cards in
supply well in a free market with
near-perfect competition the answer is a
bit convoluted at first yes a market
shortage does exist however suppliers
will quickly catch on to what's
happening they're in charge of inventory
after all and once they raise prices to
this point the market will once again be
in equilibrium that's right what we
experienced earlier in 2017 was a market
at equilibrium there was no shortage
here the more
it was perfectly stable where it was and
it still kind of is that way it's
capitalism at work love it or hate it so
in a nutshell the market shortage
occurred because prices were initially
too low when the demand skyrocketed now
this is not the fault of suppliers if
they had seen this coming months in
advance that could have deployed pricing
strategies to kind of alleviate that
sharp spike in price right they could
have driven down inventory levels slowly
or driven them up by increasing or
decreasing price accordingly this case I
recommend they probably slowly gradually
increase graphics card prices to a point
where we were at an equilibrium lower
than where we were when graphics cards
were at their peak price it's just a
particular pricing strategy which may
have worked in the situation it's kind
of hard to even play Captain hindsight
here because we aren't sure of all the
variables involved one thing is for sure
though raising prices in gradual steps
early on would have given those with the
most immediate demand a reason to
purchase them it fears of rising
continuously rising prices that is
leaving those on the fence at the mercy
of time those who see a new graphics
card providing the most utility will
purchase earlier on and spare themselves
from higher prices later on capitalism
is like mother nature ruthless and all
about survival of the fittest in this
case it's those who first saw the demand
spike months in advance mainly those who
pump and dump
online currencies so continuing with our
economic analysis here the market was at
equilibrium once the prices became
stable and around what for 450 bucks for
an Rx 485 ATS sometimes even more than
that those variances and prices are all
function of demand versus supply but the
market did have a fair value equilibrium
price where a demand and supply curves
intersected okay so it was an
equilibrium no matter what anyone says
there was no shortage market shortage
okay the amount of graphics cards in
supply had nothing to do with that
shortage because prices were allowed to
settle at a particularly equilibria now
the market shortage definition involves
some sort of price ceiling so if the
government stepped in and said hey we're
not going to allow these suppliers to
raise graphics card prices we're going
to force them to keep the prices really
low so that it happened a mandate state
really high supply instead really low
and the institution at hand said nope
these are gonna stay really low prices
we're gonna say around 150 200 bucks for
an RX 480
then we would have had a market shortage
because then
graphics cards would have gone
immediately out of supply and there
would have been any available for sale
that is a market shortage we don't have
that you can still buy an rx 480 it's
got to pay a lot more for it that's a
market at equilibrium believe it or not
similar things happen in the wakes of
natural disasters when hurricanes
threaten US coastlines suppliers ramped
up prices to compensate for the
impending demand spike they're aware
that their inventories will be drained
so they seek to obtain the largest
profit possible when it happens people
see this as distasteful and unethical
but they only look at these situations
from consumer perspectives it can be
costly in time-consuming to restore
supply levels to market equilibrium
people always blame capitalism evil
greedy capitalism for the extremely high
prices that we see in natural disasters
for example sticking with our hurricane
example but the fact of the matter is if
a single gasoline supplier let's say it
jacked up his prices to $10 a gallon
that single gas station wouldn't make a
single sale at all unless it was the
only gas station in the city which then
I would argue the government
intervention is required but if the
government stepped in and said well
we're gonna make prices stay at three
bucks a gallon everyone in the city is
gonna go to the gas station get gas and
then it's gonna dry up you want up any
gas available for sale any more after
that the same analogy works for graphics
cards as well if suppliers hadn't raised
prices those consumers who found the
most utility in the graphics cards in
question would have experienced a market
shortage in full force in a
self-correcting economy those who demand
the product the most will in turn pay
the most for it better to have little
supply at high price than no supply at
all this at least is how it works on
paper
many will always seek to unethically
manipulate an innocent market but this
year isn't unethical neither is this the
seller isn't forcing anyone to purchase
his or her product if consumers desire
it enough they will pay the price if
consumers do not they will abstain or
look elsewhere eventually forcing the
asking price down or driving that
competitor out of business
the only unethical construct involving
the free market and higher prices or
price gouging as some would call it
would be the case of cartels when a
bunch of oligopolies decide to team up
and all raise prices at the same time
which essentially gives the consumer no
choice but to purchase the product at a
much higher
price this is illegal and is actually in
the case of the United States federally
maintained so if the government sees
that a few cellphone companies for
example which they're only a few major
cell phone companies in this country
decided to all raise prices
substantially the FTC would step in the
Federal Trade Commission and say yeah
that's not allowed I'm not sure could be
another Bureau or entity in the
government but they would all step in
and say no this isn't a lot you can't do
that and then they would have to force
prices back down that is where I would
say that's a fair government
intervention property I tend to be more
just on the free-market side of things
in most cases just because if a single
graphic supply manufacturer decided to
severely raise his prices well I no
one's gonna buy from that graphics card
supplier and the few people that would
would would somehow find utility in that
product everyone else would purchase
cards that are offered at a much cheaper
price that's how the free market works
and if that single company charging much
more decided that it wasn't worth it to
sell it that high of a price you will be
forced to lower his prices or go out of
business again survival of the fittest
there's also some debate as to whether
or not government intervention in any
sense of the word should be allowed in a
truly free market it really depends on
where you stand regarding this fiscal
policy in essence everyone's an
economist and this is really a political
issue which I will try to stay out of as
much as I can now but I will say that in
most cases companies like a Sue's
gigabyte and others aren't going to
price gouge the individual when they can
help it they are merely responding to
demand stimuli from outside sources
including aetherium mining if you liked
this video maybe ya like my shirt be
sure to give this one a thumbs up I do
appreciate that also click that red
subscribe button for more content like
this if you want to see more topics like
this discussed leave your topic
suggestion in the comments below I
pretty much get all of my suggestions
from you guys stuff that I don't know
especially I like to know about read
about I'll research it then I'll make a
video like this to explain all of you in
this particular case I really like
learning about the the particular
mechanisms as to why prices and supplies
behave the way they do in wake of sudden
demand spikes really interesting stuff
stay tuned for more stuff like this this
is science studio thanks for learning
