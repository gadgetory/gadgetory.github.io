me because we're currently building one
in the NZXT Manta this is an ITX case it
is fairly large that it's perfect for a
custom loop this marks my first ITX
custom loop PC build ever but I've
pretty much got the whole ptg tube
bending thing down it's you know it's
actually fairly simple at this point but
the bends are going to be a bit more
into it because the case is
significantly reduced especially from
something like my first case which was
the PCO 11 from Lee and Lee so with that
I present to you a bunch of tech porn
time
you
all right this is where I'm going to
call it quits for part 1 I do expect I
will have the build finished in part
twos don't where this won't be a dragged
out series but I had a couple issues
that I ran into obviously this is like
you know redundant by this point with
custom loop builds but this Bend here
was fairly easy and I do think that is
like the I don't know I think it's super
cool looking because it's so simple but
it spans across the entire case so I
actually really like that bent now this
Bend I had to simplify it was originally
coming from this port here on the
reservoir up to let me see if I can get
the camera angled night this rear port
on the 240 mill rad up top now that was
very technically difficult it took about
three or four tries I was just read
bending the same you know cent of PT G
pipe and it just wasn't working so I
decided to just make a simple kind of s
Bend here up to the front 240 now the
reservoir is also kind of cracking I'm
going to try to rotate that this is just
acrylic it's not strong so that's why it
did that and then I do expect in part
two to have an issue here this is the
120 ml in the back it's going to have to
run into one of these two ports here in
the CPU because the only other port left
in the loop is up top this is going to
be my drain and fill valve here so I
that's going to be that's going to be
tough but we'll tackle that import to my
thoughts on the Manta I love it it's a
beautiful case it's very large it's not
you know the typical I TX small
form-factor case but it is the perfect
case for a custom loop like this I have
it linked in the video description along
with all the other parts here I will
catch you in part two this is Salazar
studio thanks for building this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
