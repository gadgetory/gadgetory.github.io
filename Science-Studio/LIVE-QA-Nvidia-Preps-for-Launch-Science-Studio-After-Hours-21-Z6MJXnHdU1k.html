Sunday night slash Monday morning
depending on where you live on the
planet this is after hours our 21st live
stream hard to believe we've done 21 of
these now and we skipped on quite a few
opportunities because of holidays and
other things having it on Sunday nights
kind of weird but seems like every other
tech tubers claimed another day of the
week so we're stuck with Sunday's and I
appreciate those of you who have decided
to tune in what's going on Cody so like
I see trucker bomb and mean Ben no
regrets with a Z it's spelling Wesley
Dalton what's going on folks so I
changed a title this video in a last
minute I want to talk a little bit about
the Nvidia launch coming up or supposed
it in video launch we know they're gonna
say something at games con that's
happening well tomorrow or today
depending on where you live and so we're
gonna kind of speculate a little bit
talk about what I think based on the
stuff that I've seen we should expect
performance wise from the new
architecture and you know efficiency
stuff like that and we can really look
at jumps in the past as well I'd like to
do that kind of see the progression of
efficiency for one right with how
efficient Pascal was over Maxwell that
was a huge leap I think that was even
more noteworthy than just the
performance jump overall from max what
Pascal in the same price category so for
400 bucks right that used to be GTX it's
hard to remember 970 980 territory 400
bucks now gets you at 1070 and in some
cases at 1080 and that is a huge jump
forward I mean it's an enormous gap in
frame rate differences right between
those two cards just from one generation
alone I'm gonna granted this isn't you
know an incremental thing we see every
year right in videos been on this
architecture for what three years or so
so it's not like Intel kind of refresh
in the same crap every single year and
having marginal increases we see big
increases typically with graphics card
launches and I expect this one will be
significant definitely significant yeah
see alright Victor says 1070 was 65
percent faster than 970 and I believe it
the 970 was a pretty amis a good card at
the time
I had like three or four different 970
uses and back before I could ever get a
graphics card for free so I was buying
all these and selling them and flipping
them a lot of stuff but yeah 970 was
good for 1080p middle-ground 1440p had
to drop some settings and then I
remember I had a 980 TI and that was
just that was like double 970
performance and a 980 TI is very
comparable now to a 1070 so in a 970 I
or 980 TI cost what 650 bucks $700 MSRP
back when it was the big thing so yeah I
think this will be really cool to watch
unfold over time and you know we're
gonna see the initial launch of sorts
they're gonna announce it they're gonna
talk about it try to hype it up and
stuff we're not sure when these things
will actually hit the market but there's
always some degree of you know like
there's this waiting period where
they're trying to again build up the
hype so professor says what do you think
the architects 20 70 and 20 I did going
are going to be I think that's what you
meant to say I if you're talking about
performance I think the 20 70 I mean I
think we're gonna see a comparable jump
in performance to that of maxvill to
Pascal I don't think I'm not seeing like
a huge you know like double the
performance of a 1070 and a 20 70 I
don't see like that that to me is just
too far-fetched and looking at this
stuff that we have in these graphics
cards assuming you know we don't even
know for sure if they're going to have
the components that we talked about in
our previous touring architecture video
right so having the tensor cores and
these just AI cores that are supposed to
improve things like ray tracing and
stuff that developers aren't even
utilizing and mass right now because
most cards on the market can't I mean
they don't even come close to being able
to rate trace properly so you know even
if these cards did have that you would
never be able to utilize that horsepower
effectively in modern games so I don't
see Nvidia doing that I don't see them
throwing I mean even like tensor cores
in general I don't think we're gonna
have tensor cores in and just mainstream
RTX cards if we do I don't I mean tensor
cores in general are not designed to
benefit the average gamer there
the way that they work it's it's all
talked about in the tensor court video
but in a nutshell that architecture is
only gonna benefit I mean truly benefit
things like may I modeling stuff like
that prediction analyses all of that
stuff is better for AI computing but not
necessarily better for the average gamer
Danny you're asked about what ray
tracing is I literally have a video on
that came out this week so scroll back
three videos in the timeline and you can
watch the rage facing video we talk
about what it is and how the current
touring architecture you know works with
ray tracing how ray tracing is benefited
by the architecture and why it is so
difficult to actually do on a graphical
level let's say trucker bottom says
thoughts well ray tracing put AMD out of
the GPU business in three to five years
no I don't think so I don't think I mean
I think the competition is it's missing
there's a there's like there's a big gap
I think in the higher end cards
competition-wise between the two and
video obviously dominates the higher end
market when it comes to gaming graphics
cards like a ton 7010 8010 atti titan on
that stuff
we have vega 56 and 64 but good luck
finding one that's available I mean now
you can find them and they're pretty
comparably priced to their nvidia
competitors but the launch was terrible
looking back on that the launch was just
not planned well there was there was no
supply really of them I think they were
underwhelming from a performance
perspective we think people overhyped
them there was a lot of stuff going on
around that launch that just plagued it
from the start
and he says that's how I saw it and I
was able to benchmark the Vega 64 guy
still have it I haven't used Vega 64
since I've gone and I got the a IO
version you know what's a radiator and
stuff but I haven't used it personally
since then because for one I don't like
all-in-one graphics cards I think they
look weird and second I mean most of
what I do video editing and stuff that
I'm benefited by CUDA acceleration right
that's in video obviously so I you know
using video cards I'm kind of I can have
no choice if I want to extract CUDA
benefits and programs like
premiere pro so yeah Victor says I'd
love to see Envy link-based
SLI and it does look like I know we saw
a leaked carp we're not sure what it was
some people were thinking it was the
eleven eighty then we switched it to
like the RT X 2080 or whatever we're not
sure yet we'll find out I'm sure very
soon but I expect that with the higher
bandwidth demands of the new
architecture we will have to move to
something else I haven't looked
specifically at the limits the bandwidth
limits of SLI I don't know for sure I
know we used to use just one strip now
we have to use two strips height you
know the high bandwidth SLI bridges and
stuff but I'm sure we're approaching
that boundary soon if we haven't already
and that's where NB link comes in so
we'll do more in-depth analysis on that
once we get more details let's see okay
this is a good question here killer
phobia asks how much of a price drop do
you think the current graphics cards
will experience
I don't expect it'll be much different
again the last generation there's really
I mean yeah this is you know big
advancement whatever you want to call it
you know this this new architecture is
totally different than last gen and but
they always say that right I mean I
think at the end of the day you're gonna
see a big bump in performance obviously
if not people would be very disappointed
in video stock would probably plummet or
at least partly because of the fact that
gamers were disappointed in their
hardware again we have the mining
decline that's also playing a role in it
as well so there there are a lot of
things to consider I think in general
though we'll see steady price drops
across the board down to maybe for
example a 1070 costing roughly 300 bucks
or so I don't see 10 70s going for
anything less than 300 bucks for the
next one or two years I think while
Turing over to this next architectures
next generation of gaming cards exists
as the forefront of my videos gaming
lineup
I don't expect a 1070 will cost less
than 300 bucks and I think let's see and
I think the 1080 for example no less
than maybe 350 400 obviously they can't
cross over each other that'd be weird 10
60s as low as 200 bucks
so maybe a hundred $250 price drop
that's about it it's not going to drop
much more than that and people would
gladly buy the you stuff if they could
those you know for those prices so it's
gonna work its way down slowly all again
based on supply and demand let's see I
saw a good question
up here okay scrolling up okay let's see
mark and puffs is mining is not dead
just resting and I never said it was
dead don't know why I said that but it's
it's on decline marking mining in
general is on decline that is a fact but
it's not dead of course it's not
let's see twisted ninja at science
studio going back to pre stream what do
you think the actual manufacturing costs
are for say like a k95 platinum okay
shifting gears for a second so keyboards
I was talking about keyboards there is a
certain company that was entertaining a
thought of doing a two hundred dollar
review or $200 they're not paying for
the review it's a two hundred dollar
keyboard that they want me to review and
so they told me the price up front and
I'm kind of just I don't know yet like a
you know two hundred dollars for
anything is a lot of money and I'm just
not sure if that's gonna be that was a
cat Pepsi wait what did you just knock
over is everything still working she
just like knock something over and it's
there's a long cable on it
what are you doing huh she's looking at
me all innocently right now but she
knows she did something wrong I figure
it out
if the livestream cuts off randomly it's
the cat she stepped on the on the power
strip like two days ago everything just
instantly cut off we were in the middle
like a pub G match so so yeah I see she
likes getting behind the desk and I hate
that because I have a big panel here
that blocks all the cable so you don't
see any of the cables you know hanging
behind the desk I did that just just
purely from an aesthetic purpose but she
likes to go back there because she feels
secluded like it's her own habitat and
sometimes she'll step on the power strip
and when she does everything is gone
so yeah you guys know if it cuts out
that's what happened I'll do my best to
get back as soon as possible
let's see but in regards to mechanical
keyboards I think
your bucks is a little expensive and so
I'm kind of on edge because I feel like
if I go into this review with an open
mind I'm I'm not I mean I'm not
technically and I have an open mind
because I already think that 200 is
expensive for any mechanical keyboard
out there I mean what could you put in a
mechanical keyboard that would make it
$200 is the question I have to ask I
know you can have the all-aluminum if
you know construction RGB everything
that's cool and all but like to me I
think there's a ceiling for keyboards no
matter what switch you put in there and
no matter what the build consists of
right you know metal wise or plastic
whatever you want to use so I don't know
it's the dursa warrior says $200
keyboard I would spend on more ram
instead yeah I think there are many
things you could dish that money into
you could buy a $50 $100 mechanical
keyboard and take the other hundred
bucks and throw it somewhere else
so he could line it with gold exactly I
really don't know for sure if it's even
worth reviewing I just want to be open
with the company upfront I mean cuz I
would just tell them straight up I think
it's a little expensive given what I saw
they sent the link Pepsi hey get out of
there get out of there come here get out
she's like poking her head she's poking
her head out from the desk she knows
Pepsi sit yeah
my keeper up here now okay all right you
guys want to see the kitty just trying
to bite me but yeah so I mean like my
plenty guys are saying k55 Corsair
keyboard stuff like that those are you
know relatively cheap so it's hard to I
don't know I just want to get y'all's
take on anyway let's see here any other
additional questions in regards to I saw
something about Nvidia architecture okay
that's the dance to her ass do you think
there's possibility of software being
developed to retro actively apply ray
tracing effects to older games of course
utilize in the new r-tx cards a Templar
for that'd be really weird number four
I'll be really weird Pepsi no she thinks
I'm playing with her okay come on don't
ah this is catastrophic I'm just gonna
let her go if she's gonna do what she
wants if it cuts out I'll just kick her
out of the room and we'll try this again
I don't think that you can retroactively
Lee apply ray-tracing effects I mean
these games have to be designed from the
ground up with ray tracing kind of baked
in because it's all in the code it's how
you know these api's communicate with
the different code that these guys let's
all be on me as far as I know I mean
they would have to go back and literally
build these games from the ground up
again with ray tracing enabled and that
of course for defeat them you know why
would you do that when you could just
design a whole new game from the ground
up
utilizing ray tracing from the beginning
again no I mean like think about it
you're in the business to make money as
a developer right so you want your
program whatever let's say game to be
accessed and played by as many people as
possible this is why optimization is so
important because when you design a game
that only benefits those with the best
hardware you work
putting out at least eighty ninety
percent of your potential fanbase right
so your sales are automatically cut by
eighty ninety percent and that's
assuming the people that have the cards
I can actually play the games even want
the game so you have to keep all of that
in mind when you're assessing the
viability of new you know new API is
Naomi new IP is it's not really is see
you can play games on older and newer
API so that's not necessarily what we're
talking about here but ray tracing is
something that it's not easily baked
into games and so I'm just gonna go
ahead and say up front that I think it's
it's a long way away it's not something
that many people are going to be able to
support out of the box right now because
people on nine 70s 950 T you know 950
1050 t-i-is GTX 950 750 T is all that
stuff they are going to be they're not
going to be able to play the game unless
you can somehow turn off ray tracing
which I don't know let's see yeah
growing up Wow Wow Evan Nelson having
Turin Turin in what do you think of the
1300 X plus an Rx 560 sounds like a
great budget entry build I think you
could do some solid 1080p gaming with
that system look if that's what fits
into your budget I think that's the best
combo you can go for I'm glad you went
with 1300 X and not like an i3 I think
just objectively and I three it costs a
bit more there's an interesting I don't
know I think you could probably make a
case for the i3 just because you're no
longer bound by hyper threading on two
cores and if you could pick one up for
120 bucks or so maybe the $20 Delta is
good there for purely gaming if you
don't plan a purely game though I'm not
sure if that would be sufficient it just
because being bound by four cores four
threads and that's it you might want
she's biting the crap out of my leg if
four cores in general now are gonna get
you buying most games still but when it
comes to content creating photo editing
all that
stuff you're gonna want the extra cores
you're gonna want extra RAM so it all
depends on how you wanna move your money
around I think it's a good combo that we
have there let's see here Dom Noguchi so
when you pair two monitors let's say 240
Hertz and 60 Hertz then you're gaming on
the 240 Hertz won and you open a tab or
you start watching something the game
usually locks it to 60 Hertz in the 20
to 40 Hertz monitor that's that's weird
I had a gaming monitor and a 60 Hertz
monitor so one was 144 Hertz one was 60
Hertz they were both running from the
same PC and I could literally like move
a window over between both screens and I
could see the window change from a 144
it's to a 60 Hertz like I could split it
in half and move it up and down and you
could see a huge difference and so I
know you can do both at the same time
but that's kind of a weird question I'm
not sure why I think why that would do
that in game let's see is it overclocked
5820k worth upgrading at all versus
price performance of today's stuff no I
don't think so I think you're fine with
that for now there's no point ditching
an extreme x99 system for something
that's gonna be comparable like risin 5
is pretty comparable 5820k
risin 5 2,600 2,600 acts very comparable
actually okay let's see here scrolling
down here trigger bomb hey Greg still
have a 73 2k box cutter and I don't
think I do anymore I think I broke it
I'm pretty sure I broke it or I lost it
yeah that's how little I care about this
thank you sir Gaming 101 what are your
thoughts in the gtx 750ti 1050 Ti I've
got to tell you they're they're decent
they were really those those cards kind
of upset me during the mining craze we
were gonna call it because I was I was
hoping those cards wouldn't be touched
very much bye bye bye miners and on
paper they're not the greatest mega hash
/ minor cards out there they're just
very power efficient is really their
only advantage but I think that
what was happening was these card prices
were going up across the board right up
the 1070 ish area I mean that was a
sweet spot for miners right 10 70s AMD
cards were being stolen off because of
the extra stream processors the benefits
there so those were all being affected
prices were skyrocketing but I felt I
feel like it trickled down and I'm sure
looking back this is pretty obvious but
those those price hikes trickled down to
the lower end cards as well because I
feel like people were discouraged from
buying them the higher end stuff unless
they had money you know flying
everywhere
so they they felt like they could
compromise on a lower end card for now
and then they would upgrade once the
prices resolved themselves and in that
process those lower end cards were also
affected indirectly because people had
to buy those up now you know demand for
those Rises price has to rise in
accordance with that or you'll have a
supply shortage and so I think they were
kind of hit indirectly by the craze and
that ultimately drove the remainder of
the graphics firm I could mark it up now
they're not too bad I think what they
were a mess are peeing out with a ok
price 10 50/10 50 TI it was a big jump
though between that and the 10 60 you
know there's a huge price jump there for
a lot of people in the budget space so
if you can squeeze the 10 60 out sure
but a 1050 TI is going to be good for a
lot of people especially in a 1080p
resolution it's it's really plenty a guy
Kramer do you think miners are gonna
jump on this launch I really doubt it I
mean mining is the mining market is very
different now it's it's very different I
mean I have lots of friends who used to
mine who's still mine and what I what I
pick up from them we talk about this
stuff is it's not as much now about oh I
mean you can mine new currency or new
new cryptocurrency you know all those
kind of like venture capitalists who
just want to jump into things from the
start and just hope that they can make a
quick buck without investing upfront but
there are many more people now I feel
like who are just strictly trading
cryptocurrencies and that obviously
doesn't really involve mining not on
their side because they're not the ones
doing the mining they're just
getting the currency I don't think it's
gonna be that I don't know though we
don't know for sure how well these cards
might if they're like insanely good
miners for whatever reason then sure I
think they'll be a little surge I don't
know that but if that's it's okay if its
case for that then it's also gonna be
the case for a AMD with their new cards
so I have to just kick her away she's
like biting my leg like I'm attacking it
but I'm not I'm being an innocent person
oh gosh okay
everyone likes oh no I'm seeing
something else okay oh these comments
are pretty good oh geez
do you think I should get to 1440p
monitors or a single 34 40 by 1440 I
don't really know what you're doing viv
brought Tory vibratory hippo eat I don't
know what you don't have enough context
to answer that question accurately but I
would say content creators definitely
love the ultra wide stuff I use an ultra
wide 1440p monitor when I edit videos
and that is something that I think you
should consider if you're doing that if
you're just gaming a single 1440p
monitors fine and some games won't even
support the ultra wide flooring factor
so something else to consider what's
going on Bob Flanders
hi Greg you going to get the tiara to
system I don't know I don't have I mean
I have you know contacts with AMD I
messaged him said hey I didn't get a TR
to sample you guys playing on semi one
and the answer I got back from them was
well we can only pick so many people
blah blah blah basically they don't know
what they're doing I don't know it's
just kind of strange that you would
leave you know like J with over a
million subs out from that launch but
then give those chips to people with far
fewer subs I don't think that AMD really
cares as much about the exposure that or
edelman their marketing agency doesn't
really care much about the exposure I
think they're they're more or less
interested in like the unique
perspectives the different reviewers
offer and maybe they felt like J and
Kyle and Paul myself we all kind of
offer a unique or not unique but a
similar perspective so they only dished
it to a few and then they moved on to
people in different categories I don't
really know but whatever they decided
they decided not to include us and I
don't know when I mean I never got tr1
for example so I don't know I'm not
getting my hopes up if I get one it's
gonna be from somebody else it'll be
from a motherboard manufacturer or I'll
just go out and buy one but I don't know
I don't know if I would ever need 32
cores or even 18 cores for that matter
so we'll see
twisted ninja says I was like having
dual screens and my secondary is also a
fairly junky yeah it's nice though to
scram using two screens now and I like
switching between and ultra wide is a
different kind of experience I feel like
with a with two different screens you
have first of all you have usually more
length real estate so you can have two
different things running out to four
instruments independently whereas with
an ultra water monitor it's one single
display sometimes you can split it into
two different displays with two
different cables but it's it's just a
little finicky so yeah let's see Dom
asks how was your Q sixty and are you
making an in-depth video on it I'm still
kind of in the works I'm not sure yet if
I want to do a full-on dedicated video
on a car like I used to because people
just freak out they you know when they
see you do one car review they think
that your channel suddenly changed to
you know a car review channel and they
lose their minds so I really don't know
Dalton says triple monitors are better
and actually I'm really tempted to just
you know sing some cash in to trip
monitor setups and have one from my
editing rig I don't know I had three
that's a lot of space on a desk and I
like to have my PC also on a desk so I'm
gonna need like a like these desks here
that I built are like eight feet long
I'm gonna need an 8 foot long desk to
run 3 27 inch monitors plus have my PC
on the desk and have space on my other
side or it doesn't look really weird so
I don't know but yeah I do I do like the
idea of three month because it's like
it's more symmetrical I feel like what's
going on lol epic Mike here he says
what's up bro I am new to your channel
and I am subscribed I appreciate that
nanner man says a lot of reviewers
bought their own
natter man a lot of the reviewers who
reviewed the product straight out of the
gate didn't buy their own a lot of the
guys who I mean obviously when you
review it the first day it comes out
they they were all sent samples they
couldn't buy it because it was never
being sold not up until that point
trucker bought - if I'd ever owned a
pickup truck no I'm not a truck guy I'm
an SUV guy I would buy an SUV before
about a truck I just I've I understand
the viability of trucks obviously there
are certain circumstances in which
having a truck would be very beneficial
but I just I like I like the way SUVs
look frankly and I like the way they
look more than trucks that's just me
Nana plants says Greg can you help me
my fantex p3f DX is an RGB header and
that that's a 3-pin but my motherboards
jrb G and put his four pin any ideas yes
so that's because of the three pin is
that's addressable I'm pretty sure the
three feet says it's an addressable
header you're gonna need to keep that
stuff independent so what I did with my
system that you guys saw my P through
the X build was I kept the RGB system
that was built into the case separate
from the rest of the RGB that I had
running from my cooler and from my
graphics card and stuff and from the LED
strip that I had in there so you're
gonna have two different RGB controllers
basically and the reason why is because
your motherboard doesn't likely support
addressable our jeebies there are
converters you can buy control boxes and
stuff but at this point I would say just
save the money control the RGB Xin the
case on top with the little controller
dials and call it a day okay here girl
on bag MTR redux ask D make enough money
on your YouTube channel that you can do
that full-time yes sir I'd do it full
put it this way I make enough money on
YouTube to where I don't feel like using
my degree and and my in petroleum
engineers don't I mean they're not low
paid engineering jobs that you get in
the petroleum field the reason why I did
in the first place because it was one of
the highest paid at the time it's a
little finicky because you got you know
your cycles up and down with the energy
sector when energy prices gas prices are
really low
they laid people off they don't get paid
very much
and then when gas price is really high
typically when the economy is not doing
very well
get paid a lot so it's kind of a give
and take there are waves obviously the
cycles with the economy kind of inverse
of that to be honest but I could make a
lot of money doing that more more money
than I could make doing this at this
point in time if I got a job in the oil
field I would make like twice as much as
I'm making now but I do this because I
like it because I get to be my own boss
and I get to talk with you guys in live
streams on Sunday nights because yeah
because I enjoy it it's just fun you
know I couldn't do this on a regular
field job whatever that's here ok
scrolling down detail mica eyes you're
gonna make new videos on the new cards
well of course that's what we do on the
channel ok scrolling down here ok arrow
7 7 7 says I'm thinking of buying an
oculus rift for simracing is VR worth it
look I really enjoy VR it gets old
pretty quick I think if we need more
developers in the space we need more
games I think the game is ultimately
define how how exciting VR is I have an
HTC vive I got a sample from AMD earlier
last year and then I liked it so much I
went out and bought my own HTC 5 when I
had to return AMD sample so if that
tells you anything about it I liked it
enough to drop 600 bucks on a kit but
its finicky I had an HTC vive controller
die and then I messaged them and they
said yeah it'll be six to eight weeks to
repair I'm like repair like we talking
about just send me another controller
you know I shouldn't have to wait 8
weeks to use my vibe that I spent 600
bucks on so terrible customer service on
HTC's part but again it comes back to
the games it gets old quick for me but
everyone I have try VR loves it
especially when it's their first time
they freak out it's a real feeling it
really does feel immersive and seeing
people's reactions playing VR for the
first time especially the intense games
where things are running at you and
stuff
those those reactions make it worth it
you know even if it's not me enjoying it
seeing other people react to it
I love that so take that for what it's
worth okay let's see scrolling up when
do you expect the new cards Matt you'll
be hearing something soon very very very
soon let's see I must like punishment if
I like spending my Sundays with you guys
that's awesome
Cody Salak isn't it weird to talk to a
chat by rolling by though it is kind of
weird I'm kind of carrying on the whole
conversation here but you guys are all
contributing I mean I have so many
questions and comments to address and
stuff and I love that sermon nose is
itching I love that that I love that you
guys send me stuff like if I didn't have
questions if I didn't have people
wanting to get to know me what I do on
the channel ask questions about tech you
know stuff like that then I wouldn't do
these live streams so you guys make
these happen and I'm just kind of here
to do what I can if I don't know how to
answer a question I'm not gonna act like
I know how to answer it I'm gonna tell
you either it's out of my league or I
will tell you I'll get back to y'all
research it and I'll either make a video
on it or I'll address it on Twitter or
here you know wherever so it's nice to
see the different you know thoughts and
stuff the brain storms and everything
going on in the chats and on Twitter and
elsewhere so you guys keep me happy and
excited honestly and the this kind of
stuff is my motivation to keep making
videos during the week and not want to
go you know have a normal job like a
normal person
let's see good with with a good wheel
and a good GPU okay alright so we're
gonna open it up to and ask me anything
if you guys haven't already asked
questions then get those ready and start
firing them off in the chat box and I
will do my best to answer as many as I
can if I don't get to your question
don't spam it you can post it once every
two or three minutes or so that's fine
but don't like spam it eight times in a
row I purposely won't read it's not fair
to everyone else so that's really I'll
have to say but yeah go ahead and ask
questions if you have them even if
they're weird off-topic doesn't matter
to me this isn't asking me anything you
can ask me any
that's what it means right stinky Pete
oh one says hi science to do what are
your thoughts on VA panels I'm excited
for that coming 34 40 by 1440 200 Hertz
HDR panels but I have no experience with
VA can VA hold its own against IPS
syncope I have a video literally talking
about VA versus IPS versus TN you should
go watch that video because I talk about
the pros and cons of each technology and
which one I prefer and which one I think
is the best bang for the buck and
whether you should even care which
technology is being supported in the mo
know that you're interested in so
something to consider
yep I know just blew through that
question but watch that video and I
guarantee you you will you will feel
comfortable with your decision after
that weste weste
0 or Wes Wes Oh what was your favorite
product launch and the worst gosh my
favorite product launch I got really
excited when Pascal came out honestly
because that was right when the channel
started blowing up we were gaining tons
of summer getting thousands of
subscribers per day I remember some days
we had 2,000 3,000 subs at a time in one
day and that was that was like the most
motivating thing ever and this was while
I was still in school so at this time I
thought I was still gonna have a normal
job again I thought I was just gonna be
a normal person not new YouTube full
time but then when I got out and the
channels where it was I you know took
the pay cut hitter potential pay cut hit
to do this because I do really enjoy
this more so and the Nvidia launch the
Pascal launch was just around the time
the channel was starting to really
mature and I was really excited not only
for that for the time that it came out
but also because the cards were so much
more powerful than what I was used to
testing so this is the first time I
could actually cover hands on the
launches and also give you guys you know
the inside scoop the benchmarks and
inform you before you spent your money
on something that you otherwise wouldn't
have known anything about beforehand
okay
scrolling down here the Burnham beaver
do you think AMD GCN architecture is
what's holding them back or the price of
the HBM memory they are forcing onto
their higher end cards interesting I
actually don't know enough about this to
answer fully I will say that I'm sure
HBM plays a part and that's one of the
reasons why NVIDIA has avoided HDMI
is because they've seen what it's done
to AMD in their cards and their
manufacturing abilities like they're
limited by that market because HBM is
it's one of those things that is
definitely beneficial in some respects
but is it really worth it I mean do you
notice can you tell when a card is HBM
versus gddr5 or GG dr6 right so it's it
saves space right so having on on while
on chip memory modules I guess is what
you you know high bandwidth memory
having those on the chip itself allows
the car to be physically smaller and
that's definitely a real physical
benefit but apart from that and the
higher you know the lower memory latency
stuff that's associated with it do we
really see translate into real-world
benefits right so that's something to
consider I'm just saying that yeah it's
definitely played a part I don't think
the GCN architecture necessarily is
holding them back if that's the case
then it's you know stream processors in
general CUDA cores in general we're
gonna be held by we're gonna be held
back by the some point anyway but I
think if AMD knew that that was the
limiting factor they would have changed
that a while back let's see here I see
super chat went even the super chat from
Deus Savoia found out let's see which I
think you for that man dude here is
what's the left of the M of an mail-in
rebate that took four months you have
been great to watch Thank You ppreciate
you know I sent in a cooler master hyper
t4 mail-in rebate two years ago there's
a $5 million rebate I was like what the
heck I'll do it anyway I never saw that
$5 I don't know if they mailed it to the
wrong address or that it didn't bother
but yeah I never saw it again no let's
see Nikolas Phillips do you dye your
sideburns that is no I'm 22 I'm almost
24 so the answer to that is no
oh gosh max Lawson 97 that $2 Chapman
dude case recommendations for under 100
bucks looking at 350 X that's a great
case I mean I recommend that definitely
in the 70 dollar price category I think
it beats out the s3 40 if you want
around 100 bucks the defined C tempered
glass Edition is a really great case so
as a measure if I see as
the p400 from ban tags and the s340
elite you should also consider if you
want to go just above a hundred bucks
the leniently PCO 11 dynamic cases they
are very nice both the white and black
variants so there's a spiel for you in
that general crash category PA asked
have you ever tried gaming on Linux
correct no I've never tried gaming on
Linux I've used Linux one time before
and was on a chrome there's a Chromebook
that I hacked and put Linux on and then
I'd very quickly switched it back to
Chrome OS cuz I hated Linux it's just
not my cup of tea I'm not very
comfortable with Linux because I'm not
very comfortable the software not that
kind of coding and stuff so let's see
you're scrolling down to evan Harman
1070 gr 1080 really depends on the price
I can't give you something specific
without context I'm grumpy on PC do you
think r-tx will be something amazing we
talked about that the beginning of the
livestream so I invite you to scroll
back I'm sure you I think you can do
that on a timeline and we talked about
it otherwise it would be archived this
live stream so you can watch on the
channel later but I talk you know quite
extensively about Nvidia upfront and
we'll close talking more about it what I
think and what you guys should look
forward to price-wise and stuff based on
what I've seen I don't like talking much
about rumors and stuff but we're pretty
confident now what we're gonna hear over
the next week from Nvidia so what will
summarize with that again if you were a
vegetable what vegetable would you be
from agent W interesting I think I would
be broccoli or something
I say broccoli because I used to have
really long hair when I was younger and
it always grew out kind of like an afro
but uh it was like very it was a very
loose afro because it's just you know
wavy hair kind of curly and it would do
weird things but it would look like
broccoli in another way what's gonna
sprawl up and just my whole head would
look like that and then the very slim
stalk for the neck so uh yeah that's
probably what would fit I'm not sure
just off the cuff
let's see 3G that thing won't the same
high school together and college mostly
and Troy I love the channel thanks 3 G's
I went to Troy for a year I ended up
switching to a program ahead engineering
Department that Troy doesn't have
engineering that's like the only reason
why I changed I was I was a business
major economics I think is what it was
financial economics at Troy for a year
and then I switched to to the University
of Louisiana because because of that now
but Roy is beautiful I love Troy I would
go back to Troy no heartbeat
and then yeah Moseley as well what's
your name three.js I probably know you
scrolling down Christopher asdf do you
think 9900 K will be a lot better than
8700 k stock oh I don't really know I
don't think it's gonna be a huge jump in
performance put it that way we're
talking maybe and the extra cores are
gonna benefit from with an IPC
standpoint though I would say no more
than 10 percent I'm gonna say more or
less in the realm of six percent six to
eight percent depending on the
real-world architectural benefits and
how well Windows 10 and other operating
systems can utilize the new architecture
Taipei Taiwan 10 Greg who is the we you
talk about is the channel just you I do
have Lisa helped me quite a bit at least
it does a lot behind the scenes as it is
will will does his own thing will those
will things will well as all over the
place and he's what he's very good at
all the stuff that he does but every now
and he helps us here on the channel as
well so I don't like doing them a
disservice and and you know to me it's
an insult when I act like people don't
help me when they actually do and so
that's why I say we even when I'm the
only one making videos I say it anyway
just because I think it's the right
thing to do truck or bomb what is your
favorite current ban favorite band
member or favorite band ever favorite
band ever has got to be Breaking
Benjamin my favorite current bands
probably Bring Me The Horizon I like
both of those bands for different
reasons I think Breaking Benjamin is
very consistent I love all of their
music because it always sounds the way I
envision Breaking Benjamin is sound and
then Bring Me The Horizon just has such
a dynamic song like their and their new
album apparently gonna be really good
too hopefully but when you go back as
far as that maternal and there is a hell
and stuff like that like those albums
are just lit but for different reasons
than their new albums because like if
you listen to Ono or follow you from
that's the spirit and then you listen to
Shadow Moses or something you know
there's like just two totally different
bands but they're so dynamic they're so
good and confident in what they do that
they can they can sound that different
so yeah let's see Ali Oh Ali the king
can we play csgo for a video maybe on a
gaming channel somewhere uh yeah I'm
sure I suck at csgo I haven't played I
have like two hours in csgo like I'm not
very good at it at all so I would be
disappointing but sure I mean I guess if
I have some time I could do that
DJ Rick's what do you think about the
i-5 8400 and gtx 1070 for 1080p gaming
DJ rex have a video literally talking
about this with those resolutions in a
video it's a high five eighty four
hundred plus a gtx 1080i so that's an
even more extreme case but watch that
video it'll answer your question let's
see nano man says these live streams
we've gotten better and better i believe
a lot of good questions coming in and
Greg's not always saying not always
saying I already made a video about it
he says that and I literally just told a
good watch the video like looks the
reason why I say that not because I feel
like repeating myself 20 time because
people watch the same questions every
live stream and there are new people and
I don't blame up they don't know what
was answered I don't I can't get mad at
them for that or whatever but I when I
tell people to watch videos it's because
the the answers themselves aren't very
straightforward and like when it's a
benchmark like let's say how was any
house an i5 mixed with the 1070 perform
I can't really just give you in a
nutshell how well it performs I could
say that it's gonna be a generally
balanced system especially for games
that utilize a max of four to six cores
for sure that our frequency bound which
very few cases they will be but you know
I tell them that just because I feel
like those videos are out there for a
reason there's a lot more information in
those videos than what I could tell you
in a 30-second response on a live stream
so it would do you a solid to watch the
video not because I care about the view
and I care about the no fractions of
pennies that we'll get from your view
but because it'll actually benefit you
to watch the video so there's my
rationale I'm trying to CMA here oh
let's see silent j studio show the cat i
did show the cat earlier in the
livestream he might not have been here
but
she was here I don't know where she's
now she's sleeping I don't want to wake
her up she'll step on cables and crap
and she was doing that earlier so I'm
gonna leave her she's being a good girl
right now
a good girl Pepsi it's a good girl yeah
she's out she didn't even respond
attactive in today's competitive climate
do you think for a new streamer youtube
is better than twitch that's really
tough I'm not very familiar with twitch
that's why I stream to YouTube because I
don't think I mean I don't have a huge
fan base on twitch anyway but whenever I
screamed at which I get maybe 10 20
concurrent viewers
whenever I stream on YouTube right now
we got what 275 or so so we can get
easily ten times the pull here and
that's why I think it's better to do it
here for me just because I built my
original fan base here on YouTube but in
general I mean twitches I think it'll be
more competitive depending on what you
do though
there are plenty of twitch gamers out
there right but I think the creative
stuff that's not is that's why the
requirements used to be I don't know if
it's still the case the requirements for
creative twitch streamers used to be
lower than the requirements for gaming
streamers because they were the gaming
was more competitive right so yeah I
think it's I think it's more competitive
at this point to be a gamer on twitch
but traction on youtube is it's tough
it's debts to catch-22 because YouTube
isn't as popular for gaming streaming
for game streaming as switches so you
gotta weigh the pros and cons ultimately
I think twitch is still a better
platform for this but I really don't
know I mean you just have to feel it out
that's tough genki genki 883 one asked
do you think the pc building is a dying
hobby absolutely not in fact it's been
growing quite a bit I mean the number of
people getting involved in PC gaming PC
building has been exploding and that was
partly due to the fact that channels
were I mean you can see how fast channel
is used to grow how many people are
trying to do the whole tech channel
thing now it's because it was in
response to how many people were getting
into it at the time when consoles were
getting pretty expensive people were
like screw it I'll just built a PC and I
get the best of both worlds so yeah
let's see
Skybolt what is currently your favorite
laptop it's the one I reviewed like five
videos ago the huawei mate book X Pro
best all-around MacBook MacBook the best
all-around laptop in my opinion from a
portability standpoint as well as a
performance standpoint I render 74
respect to your first PC I get asked
this like every live stream I 340 350 40
I almost at 40 350 K the I 340 150 and
gtx 750ti that was my first purely
gaming build that i built myself when I
was younger I was building and - oh me
my dad would bring home PCs and I would
tear them apart and put them back
together and stuff and that was his way
like teaching me intro electronics and
everything I was really young we used to
do that I was always interested in
electronics but I never really knew how
they worked until I got into school so
it really comes down to you know at the
time I was just wanting to build a PC
that I could game on and video edit on
and that was what I was what prompted me
to build my first legit PC on my own
with my own money and that was what it
had in an i3 4150 and then gtx 750ti
let's see Ian paying not familiar with
US laws what did you mean in your tweet
about immigration laws so I was talking
about how difficult it is for people to
immigrate to the US so because Lisa and
I are married we yet we can apply for a
different visa so we apply for the cr1
visa you could apply for the k3b so it
really depends but generally I take
about the same amount of time used to be
the cr1 was a faster way to immigrate
and they kind of trade blows now so 7 to
9 months roughly is what its gonna take
before she can come here and stay here
now we could have gotten married when we
did and she could have just stayed
because she didn't originally come here
to implant on staying so when we got
married it was kind of it was kind of
spontaneous like we were already engaged
and we knew we were gonna get married
soon we didn't want to wait you know a
year or whatever but we weren't sure
when we were gonna do it and at one
point we just kind of decided together
we were just gonna do it I mean it was
pretty spontaneous and you know we
didn't really have a wedding or anything
like that we just got married and it was
let's see I think that was like in that
was March 18th was our
wedding day but I think she left like
two days later now she could have stayed
we could have adjusted stuff because we
didn't plan on her staying that was
totally just out of the blue like it's
technically you can't come here with the
intention of staying on a nest Arabs or
whatever that's defrauding the
government and we didn't know that we
didn't know about any of this stuff so
she went back home then we started
reading up the immigration laws and like
what do we need to apply for and then we
got shafted because it turns out she
can't come back now and stay because she
already left she can't adjust anymore
that's the rule and the cr1 processing
times are like seven to nine months
which means that we need to keep going
back and forth now paying these $700
thousand dollar plane tickets to see
each other and it sucks not only on our
bank accounts but it sucks just being a
part you know like you don't marry
somebody with the intent of being away
from that person so that's partly why I
was kind of bringing up the immigration
part of it okay that's why we're apart
right now is because the immigration
process in the u.s. is so slow so
there's some yeah sorry about the
romantic stuff I'm supposed to be tech
talk but yeah that's that's it a
nutshell that's why it's kind of
frustrating okay here Matt asked what
keyboard do you use right now I'm using
master keys from Coolermaster I do have
a G skill oh gosh km5 setna km 570 MK 5
so I don't remember what it's called
it's from G skill 750 something I'm just
throwing out numbers at this point I
have a G skill keyboard I really like as
well the type of switch that I like the
most i trade blows between browns and
blues I like blues better from a tactile
feel but I hate to sound like the sound
rotates me and I've like OCD oh no what
I have but it just it arcs me and when
I'm concentrating what I'm typing I love
the feel but I hate the sound so I
compromise on Browns most of the time so
I'll game on Browns and I'll type on
Browns as well so yeah anyway let's see
yeah all the good all I appreciate you
guys
you see Harris as I work in immigration
here in Canada and I know that doesn't
help but it's much worse he did you hear
how longer your immigration times like
like if I married a Canadian and I
wanted to immigrate to Canada how long
would how long would the immigration
process take before or how long would I
have to wait until I could live in
Canada with her I'm curious how long did
how long it takes
let's see Daniel got through hey Greg
over clocking my rise in 1600 when I set
V quarter 1.35 and the bios hardware
monitor shows it's pulling a massive VDD
1.55 volts and your experiences accurate
I'm not too sure just remember V Corps
and V DD are totally different but I
don't know it's probably gonna depend on
the board I'll have to check but if all
you're doing is tampering with V Corps
and you're leaving everything else on
auto then I would say in most cases it's
safe it might not be optimal but it's
likely safe
these are preset you know Auto
conditions when these motherboard
manufacturers are testing these CPUs
they kind of calibrate all the stuff up
front make sure that the system runs
stable otherwise people who don't know
how to tinker in the BIOS would always
arme their boards because nothing's ever
stable so as long as you leave that on
auto you should be okay but I would have
to do more research in that specific
board to know why it's doing that
scrolling down to G here says live in
Canada 1.5 years easy ooh
that's that that hurts that's tough I'm
surprised the US is easier than Canada
that's really weird just like you would
think now with the current political
climate and stuff and just I don't
really know for sure but I know that
it's not it's easier it would have been
easier ten years ago to emigrate in the
US and that is now not just because of
presidents and policies and stuff but
just because we have quotas and there
are certain conditions in which you know
it's it's just gets backed up and when
people immigrate in mass it's a lot
harder to kind of squeeze your way in
there and immigrate quickly because it's
all first-come first-serve basically
unless you get like special appointments
and people rank you up so
yeah let's see the sound thing is miss
phone yeah it's a condition similar to
sensory overload where specific sounds
unexplainably annoy you like coughing
eating etc I wonder if they have a day
and I wonder if they have like like
solid like proof for like explanations
for why that happens like if there's
some like process in the brain that
gives somebody that condition or if it's
just a generic you know term they use to
explain something that scientists can't
explain otherwise I wonder
let's see Sam can't love from India I
love all your videos I appreciate that
Sanket thank you for your support and
thank you for watching this would be
Monday afternoon for you correct so I
appreciate that
let's see Matthew Beebe how do I open up
my motherboards BIOS likely got a spam
delete so right when you turn your PC
you're gonna get a little splash screen
of your motherboard logo and something
else at the bottom just keep clicking
delete
until something different than your
desktop shows up that's gonna be your
BIOS let's see scrolling down here
scrolling down rise official should I
get a new CPU or GPU for fps that's a
very vague question but in general if
you're looking for a higher framerate
than what you're operating at let's say
you're offering a 60 Hertz right now
with your current monitor and you want
to bump up to 144 it's monitor very
likely you'll be limited by your CPU
very extreme cases in which the GP was
still the bottleneck obviously if you're
running like a g2 10 with an i3 4150 in
it then your g2 10 is still gonna be the
bottleneck even at the higher refresh
rate just because you're not gonna be
able to run anything in that resolution
period so yeah but in general the CPU is
gonna determine is gonna limit your
framerate more so than your graphics
card will and that's due to multiple
reasons parallelism is a reason why the
graphics card is able to push so many
frames at the same time your CPU has a
fixed number of cores very few by
comparison to the number of CUDA cores
and generic graphics cards and stream
processors and AMD graphics cards and
that is one of the reasons why the CPU
ultimately becomes a bottleneck so
there you go in a nutshell I'm already
here scrolling down we get to the bottom
of things
Daniel Guthrie five-dollar Zealand Wow
appreciate that much dude thanks Greg
appreciate your feedback have a great
evening you as well actually evening
here in New Zealand so 13 14 hours ahead
so it's your afternoon right it's gotta
be your afternoon if my pretty sure dude
the date line messes me up so bad the
International Dateline cutting through
the Pacific that throws me off every
time we go to copy text it just blows my
mind because technically we're going
back in time when we fly from Taiwan
back to the States because we're
crossing the Dateline even though we're
going forward in time forward in time
forward of time then we pass the
Dateline then we're back a full 24 hours
and it's just like like so the whole
plane trip is like negative two hours
it's insane Jeff fly says you are the
best I'm going to bed
good night thanks Jeff flying thanks for
watching well some blood dude your
channel is awesome I appreciate that
thank you very much you guys are being
overly supportive right now it's kind of
surprising I feel like something fishy's
going on all mix there entertainer you
look like Superman I probably look like
a super anorexic Superman but I
appreciate the compliment I guess
scrolling down a lead Akeem what do you
think of the i7 4790k at 5 gigahertz
that that seems rather than unobtainable
but if you think you can hit it I would
like to know how you hit it with what
cooler if you're not Ellen to cooling
that sounds really awesome though hmm
okay let's see here what else do we have
what else do we have
oh yeah so Dana says it's the afternoon
it's my birthday - happy Daniel dint
have me Pappy Daniel Wow happy birthday
Daniel I just butcher that whole thing
geez
ok mr. Leonardo I do if my 970 doesn't
display video that is not a good sign my
friend check your PCI connections swap
the PCIe slot that your card is plugged
into more than likely it's plugged into
the top slot just to narrow down the
chance that it's your PCI slot itself
try moving that card down to a different
16 Lane slot and see if it post then if
it does not then you might want to check
I mean you don't want to you don't want
to just up and decide that
the graphics pardon have to armaid or
return it or whatever so you want to
narrow it on every other possibility I
mean literally like check the power
supply cables if it's a modular power so
make sure those cables aren't unplug you
know if the graphics cards not getting
power it won't send signal if especially
if it says supplemental power connection
we're talking about it's that's really
about it I don't I can't think of
anything else you can narrow down the
top of my head but it's likely graphics
card issue if you're not getting a post
that is in my experience usually the
case
also check doctor debug plug in a
speaker and see how many beeps you're
getting and try to diagnose it that way
because it might not be a guy you never
know you might not get a post for some
other reason check RAM slots all that
stuff but if you're assuming it's your
graphics card or something happened to
do with it then do what I said check the
slot check the power connection and then
narrow it down from there okay let's see
every time I scroll down it screws up I
scroll down like two times and then it
kicks me all the way to the bottom then
have to scroll back up again I hate this
render 74 what do the specs to your
first PC dude I literally answered your
question like 10 minutes ago
so either you weren't paying attention
or you're just asking again just to get
my attention again but I did answer that
question already sue maybe you afk let's
see Charles bail do you have beautiful
teeth dude I appreciate that Charles
honestly though it's kind of a front
because these teeth I earn it they see
they're pretty straight I had braces but
my bottom tooth my bottom two teeth in
the center they kind of overlap each
other so they're supposed to be side by
side right but one tooth fell behind
closer to my tongue and then kind of
like slid behind it so they're not
totally covering each other but like you
can tell that one's leaning on the other
and that sucks so yeah they're not I'm
not really beautiful once you look at
them but braces did definitely help
let's see scrolling down festive got to
go to bed first day of high school
tomorrow
I'm a freshman alright festive best of
luck in your classes remember school is
very important and and like you don't
need to be successful in school to be
successful in life but it helps okay it
really does help there aren't as many
barriers in your way so best of luck
let's see twisted ninja five dollar
Canadian thank you twist it appreciate
that here's five CAD bucks but really
it's like one point
- five four eur/usd people
so here's enough money for a pop from
the vending machine
what is your conversion rate on let's
check is it's always changing CAD and
USD are always changing see conversion
0.77 so five Canadian dollars is three
dollars and eighty three cents that's
awesome I appreciate that
I'll let's see scrolling down though Wow
in 2013 it was almost one to one and
then it see it dropped in 2016 Wow at
the beginning of 2016 it dropped to its
lowest point 0.67 ish that's that's
really low
that's a big drop very quick I'm not
sure the underlying cause of that but
that's that's kind of sketchy okay but I
appreciate it thank you
let's see Matt asked do you think I
could overclock the 8700 K to five point
two gigahertz with a crack in X 72 a IO
I depends on the chip obviously you have
bending issues to worry about so if you
have a good chip maybe if you have a bad
chip absolutely not if you D lid and
apply liquid metal which is what this
next video I'll be releasing tomorrow is
about then you'll have a much better
shot at hitting that frequency so maybe
you stay tuned for the video you might
die might learn something and maybe be
encouraged and deal it'd it sucks that
we have to do it but you know it's what
we have to do is until if it's terrible
Tim over there dies
Daniel Connor Greg collecting parts for
new build last three items are 9900 k
motherboard and 2080 TI will it play
1440p at 144 it's for the next six years
dude I don't look that far I'm not a
fortune teller I have no idea that I can
tell you're gonna be set for a long time
and yeah I mean you know if I had to
guess yeah I think you'd be five to six
years is a long time technology changes
very quick so I don't know I would say
six years
there's render render 74 says yeah
that's right oof I answered his question
assuming it's a guy and he asked a
question later on and I guess he didn't
hear it okay and that's twisted says
yeah I did we were super stoked when our
money had almost been about the same as
the US but then that
changed again pretty quick you guys are
like yeah we're right there with the US
and then you know what's happening
what's going on although our currency to
be fair is pretty trashed too so I mean
look how strong the English pound is
right pound it so the pounds always been
higher than USD as far as I can remember
so yeah let's see Cody asked check your
discord PM's after stream if you could
please I don't have personal messages
enabled for people in the discord just
because that would get tons of personal
messages I get tons of personal messages
on Facebook you could tweet me Cody or
you could just message us in the donor
live strand that in the donor Channel
I'm very you know it's much more open
they're obvious because the donor
channel so if you want to do it that way
then I'll be able to respond personally
to you it's one of the benefits of being
a donor patreon supporter or in your
case YouTube sponsor join or Joyner or
whatever YouTube like change the join
button it changed it from member or like
subscribe whatever they call it not
subscribed was uh what was it
she's the subscribe button and Twitter
and not Twitter the subscribe button and
twitch is like the pay button right but
then on YouTube the subscribe button is
not the pay button it's the other button
I think it's the member button whatever
they called it beforehand I can't
remember sponsor that's what it was a
sponsor button and then they changed the
sponsor button to the join button and so
now my old video talking about the
subject make makes no sense now because
that button doesn't exist anymore so GG
YouTube anyway yeah rip so but I
appreciate it Cody I thank you for
sponsoring us or whatever you want to
call it on YouTube now and I'll check
the discord so be sure to drop a comment
or drop a question whatever and I'll
check it out let's see
dan says the pounds been doing really
poor the last five years ever the pounds
still better than us is what I mean like
you're still doing alright by comparison
yeah 1.27 so over the last five years
let's see in 2018 you were 1.4 now
you're at 1.3 roughly your peak and 2014
was 1.7 you were almost two times and
then in 2007 right before the crash
which I think this is all inflated
anyway so I wouldn't even worry about
pre 2008 stuff but you were literally
two to 2.0 five times US currency pre
2008 you know pre housing crisis so yeah
it's been going down quite a bit but
you're still stronger than us that was
really the point I wanted to get across
there the work Hawks is liquid metal
worth the hassle I'm gonna answer that
question tomorrow in my video so stay
tuned for that
let's see Eric Phan stock fain stock
Eric Dane stock remember me from last
week honestly you know I feel bad but I
gotta be honest I really don't but if
you ask a question if you did then if
you bring the question back up I'll
probably remember the question there are
so many names on this chat honestly it's
really awful really difficult to
remember I remember all the sponsors and
stuff because they have little icons
next to their name and they're not many
sponsors so I know all of them I know
Cody
mr. KF gaming trucker Baum all them
because there's only like 20 channel
sponsors but you know there are a lot of
names to go through otherwise yeah let's
see are you going to be watching the
live stream Greg it's possible I'll be
I'll be asleep probably when it happens
but I'll watch the live stream after
it's already been archived I'm sure and
we'll see what's what okay Vietnamese
dawn greater than USD knob no I want to
google it right now oh my god point zero
zero zero is zero for three US dollars
for one Vietnamese doll my dude that is
the ultimate roll okay
Chris Ark says $1,000 or $1,200 for PC
gaming dude I have no you give me no
contacts and I question I can't answer
it accurately for you Patrick will you
ever review the our asus rog HDR monitor
the new one I'm not sure which one
you're talking I guess there's only one
new HDR monitor I'm sure if they send it
to me but I'm not gonna go out and buy a
monitor to review it those monitors are
very expensive let's see do you use a
UPS for backup no I don't because I'm
too cheap to buy one I'm sure I could
benefit from it but honestly I mean if
power gets cut off I'll just power the
thing back on I'm not like running
servers or anything where I need
constant power or power backups oh yeah
okay let's see Matthew's asking about
bio stuff Matthew I do have an
overclocking guide it's a very old
overclocking guy but he type in you know
science to do overclocked guide then
you'll you'll see it oh I was like 2
years younger is like a two-year old
video but the principle still the same
matching vcore trying to find the
optimal vcore lowest peak where possible
with the highest attainable frequency
tweaking a few other things is also
possible but you know load line
calibration and stuff but in general
volt V core and frequency the ones you
really want to worry about you could do
per core overclocking and stuff to new
member we have Dan Stewart is a new
member of the channel that means that
he's paying five bucks a month to be a
channel member he gets a cool battery
next to his name that will progressively
increase in charge until it reaches the
full green battery charge at the end of
it I appreciate that Dan and look
hopefully you want to stick around and
get that beautiful green better it's a
way of kind of suckering you in to keep
wanting to be a member but we'll see so
yeah so now remember Dan forever because
Dan's got that icon next to his name
that's really cool by the way if you
guys don't like the icons or whatever we
can always change those to something
else some other like incrementally
increasing icon this was just something
I came up with on top of my head because
yeah let's see yeah leapin Castillo
please help look back at 8:04 p.m. 804
p.m. it's not even 804 p.m. here you
should have ant you should have asked if
you asked a question you should have
asked it in that
donation because I can't see it I can't
go back that far and there are no time
stamps on any of these comments and I'm
looking at so it kind of s so well I'm
sorry but just comment I'll look for
your name so that you don't feel like
you threw money at me for nothing and I
will I will try my best to answer if I
see it leave in Castillo I will look for
your name okay Patrick do you ever did
you ever go to school for engineering
necessary type of engineering is like
yeah I went to school I have a petroleum
engineering degree and I'll be
graduating in like a month and a half
with my Masters in Business
Administration so kind of two different
things there but yeah I have a video
talking about the engineering program my
experience with in stuff by the way in a
dedicated video if you're interested in
that and capacitors chemical a lot of
people think I was a chemical engineer
and that's really because petroleum
engineers are they're few and far
between let's not say that were rare but
like we our occupations are very
specialized you know not most companies
could benefit from having a mechanical
engineer on hand or an electrical
engineer on hand chemical is a little
more specialized and then petroleum is
very specialized in the sense that you
know like we do one thing that's it like
electrical engineers can be more like
they can work on more than one thing
like we have underlying electrical
mechanical and chemical principles that
we had to you know study when we were in
school so we took thermodynamics
electrical circuits we took all the
generic engineering classes and stuff
but then we specialized heavily on
drilling geology and the like and as a
result you know that's kind of all
culminated into this petroleum
engineering field but yeah I you know I
could go and do that and make 100k a
year but I just a part of me I mean I
still want to send out resumes and see I
was a good student I graduated with a
3.8 GPA in college and that's not it's
not easy in an engineering program but
it's it was something I was always
pretty good in school I I never went out
party anything like that I
Maran YouTube full-time while I was in
college you know building a building a
business while in college keeping my
grades up that was like now that I was
like I was a good boy and it paid off I
mean like I don't have to work as an
engineer because I could do this but how
much longer I can do this before it
becomes unsustainable I don't know if
YouTube deletes my channel tomorrow
there's another scenario so I'm glad I
had the degrees to kind of act as a
fallback even though I never went into
these degrees thinking they were gonna
be fall backs but yeah so yeah there's
some there are chemical engineering
classes we have to take fluid dynamics
organic chemistry stuff like that
transport phenomena and then there are
some mechanical principles as well
statics mechanics materials
thermodynamics physics one physics two
you name it so yeah that's about the
that's about a culmination of it mr. ma
I think that $5 super chapped my dude
I'm good to see you're doing well my
dude loved the channel as always I
appreciate that chances the next i7i
nine will require a new motherboard 77
okay is lacking in course yeah that's
something that Brian and I were talking
about it's looking a lot like they're
gonna it's I I would put money on these
CPUs require any motherboards the reason
why I say that is because Pat it's all
about power delivery so Z 370 has a
fixed I mean not a fixed power line but
Z 370 motherboards I don't think are
going to be able to tolerate the power
draws from eight core CPUs I really
don't I don't know it's it's gonna be
tough especially the higher frequencies
I just don't see it happening I think
we're gonna need a new platform for them
I think some of them maybe some of the
you know the lower chips will be
compatible with BIOS updates
maybe the I 999 hundred K whatever it's
called will be compatible too but if I
had to put money on it I would say no
and looking at Intel's track record
there was what one or two there was one
time that I can recall recently when we
could do that I was skylake to KB Lake
and I was effectively the same
architecture I mean there was literally
no difference there right
but with coffee lake now there's a
difference and with whatever
next also a difference so that's at
least what I think it's a good question
I've talked about that a lot but I think
the answer to that is yes it will
require a new motherboard which is
unfortunate but you know it's Intel so
oh all right so we're gonna do a couple
more questions now it's like 10:10 I try
to keep this to an hour or so it starts
to drag out past an hour but you guys
are asking really good questions so I'm
gonna keep doing that let's see Tata
1988 says tiger ka year not really it's
at least 130 K year 130k a year here in
GCC country and excuse me that really
depends on the location obviously yes
and it also depends on the current
market so right now like I knew there
was a guy that taught my class who was I
mean this was he was the best of the
best in our class he had you know every
credential you could think of he started
working for Chevron they hired him on I
think they offered him a 20k signing
bonus and a hundred K a year and this is
Chevron so and in the u.s. right we
drill ton offshore texas-louisiana
onshore and South Dakota and North
Dakota and places like that so I would
say saying 130k year is not a fair
estimate for the states right now for
the states right now it's about a
hundred K year in general the signing
bonuses and stuff aside so and that's
likely starting which is really good and
it's not the highest engineering
salaries around but again like knowing
that I could possibly make that much
money or even more than that is still
not enough to get me from to get me to
stop doing what I'm doing or even make
this a part-time job it really depends I
miss the benefits and stuff of a real
time job but I don't know I think it's
some point I'll have to anyway at least
and I start thinking about having kids
and stuff it's gonna be really expensive
because YouTube has no benefits for its
creators you know we have to pay for
health insurance and all that stuff
out-of-pocket retirement all of that so
that's something you you forego when you
decide to be a youtuber twitch streamer
or whatever just FYI people don't think
about that till they're in it mmm no
it's
a rusty Shackelford great you have plans
for the channel when the tariffs against
China rear its ugly head not sure what
all that's gonna encompass yet I don't
want to make predictions people are
freaking out saying it's the end of PC
gaming all this crap because they think
that the trade wars with China are gonna
cripple everything anything that is
electronic it's gonna be you know
surging in price whatever I'm gonna wait
and see before I make speculations about
that kind of stuff because we don't
really know I mean the China in the u.s.
right now because the US is suddenly
randomly aggressive with China and
China's you know responding accordingly
China's like hey you push us we're gonna
push you back we got to look strong you
know every country that thinks they're
the best country is gonna do that but
every now and then we see compromises
and those compromises alleviate some of
the concerns in the markets especially
with the the US markets right we look at
the New York Stock Exchange every day we
hear good things about the trade wars
you see that the stock prices just jump
up all Green Arrow's everything you know
investments great outlook is great
forecast is great and then all of a
sudden we get bad news about the trade
deals and then everything goes down we
have red arrows everywhere now it's just
an up-and-down game of BS frankly and
everybody is just on their toes willing
to click the Buy button or the sell
button depending on whatever they hear
on CNN or Fox News the next day it's
just it's all garbage in my opinion a
market is so unstable and unpredictable
because it shouldn't be as high as it is
in general I don't think I'll invest for
the time being in anything just because
I don't think I could predict it
accurately enough you could look at any
financial record you want any balance
sheet financial statement you know it's
you just never know the only ones that
really benefit are the inside traders
and the people that already have tons of
dollars spread out in huge portfolios
and they're making Bank anyway so yeah
there's much spill in the market but
that's one of the reasons why I don't
really touch it let's see okay syncope
does it make sense for a BIOS limit for
a BIOS limit if is either 370 can't
fully power 9900 K and then fully power
with a C 390 chipset does it make sense
for a BIOS limit if no that's that's
what I'm saying I if there's a power
limit then it's not going to be a BIOS
update to fix that issue that's what I'm
saying if it's a power limit you're
gonna
need a new platform a new chipset a
totally redesigned motherboard from the
ground up you know you can't just
suddenly want to pull more power through
and expect the prm's everything to
manage power distribution accurately and
you know safely without getting super
hot we don't know yet I don't know how
efficient these chips are gonna be but
off the top of my head I'm just I'm just
thinking that they're not gonna be
compatible max Matt Barnes good question
what is this max safe temps excuse me
max safe voltage I'm assuming you're
meaning vcore for horizon second gen ah
I think Rison has a there's a limit of
like 1.5 nobody should ever go that high
I wouldn't go above 1.4 personally if
you could get to 1.4 keep temps down
then fine I doubt you'll be able to do
that this is a really really steep
threshold there once you get to 1.4 if
temperatures really skyrocket but in
general I keep minor on 1.3 1.3 5 and I
call it a day I don't go any higher than
that if I'm recalling correctly I get
intel on a MBV course confused but
they're usually pretty close together
I'll check I don't remember what I have
the overclock on this 2700 here but all
that alpha see let's see leaving
Castillo this is 1700 X on X 470 have
better ram compatibility ooh I don't
think so and it's not it's not the same
as running 2700 X on an X 370 so and my
in my testing I found that it was the
CPU that it was a CPU itself that was
struggling to keep up with memory
frequencies and timings so even if you
run a 1700 X on X 470 and the X 470
motherboard supports the frequency
doesn't mean that the CPU is going to so
it's I would not buy an export 70 board
with the expectation that the memory
that you buy is automatically gonna run
at XMP profile at 700 X my 1700 X is a
pain in the butt to get X and P profile
enabled on no matter what I do any Ram
kid I use X and P is literally
impossible in every X 370 or be 350
motherboard I use so yeah it's
definitely gonna be CPU bound
that regard if you were really worried
about that I would sell the 1700 X and
try to buy something else but that is a
limiting factor for sure let's see okay
Erik fain stock what do you think of the
new Chinese consul with a custom AMD SOC
I like breeze past that like I saw that
article or whatever you know I saw one
of the articles regarding that thing and
I I didn't really care
I saw consul and I was like you know
whatever like it just doesn't hair tape
literally the word consul turned me off
that's how like an that console I am AC
Crouch 2016 hi your videos are helpful I
appreciate that thank you for stopping
by and checking this out tech Crimson
thank you for being the moderator by the
way I appreciate that I meant to make
one other guy moderator I see tech
crimson here all the time
that's awesome let's see here
woke no time says hi Greg good to catch
a stream of yours so what's going on
woke I appreciate you stopping by and
and us badly
thanks guys love this Q&amp;amp;A session really
helpful I appreciate that look I'm just
trying to fire off as many answers
questions as I can my voice is important
I throw it sparks right now but we're
about to end the stream maybe let's do
let's do like two more questions so if
you guys throw questions at me I want to
see good questions don't spam with the
same question over and over but give me
one or two good questions that you want
to hear answered in the next two or
three minutes and I will do my best to
to pick the best one I don't know I
can't I can't read every question and
answer every question obviously but if I
didn't answer your question this live
stream come back next week we do this
every night excuse me every Sunday night
or Monday morning
it's 9:00 p.m. CST Central Standard Time
here in the States on Sunday nights
that's whatever translated time it is
where you live and yeah okay let's see
here Beastmaster 101 PCI a wireless
network cards versus USB dongles in my
experience the wireless cards and PCI
PCI or Wireless cards are way better the
USB dongles are gonna be limited not
only by the bandwidth but also by
in most cases it's just the antenna and
then the antennas are terrible so and
the USB interface is also kind of an
extra bridge so in my experience
Wireless cards that plug into PCI slots
are much better good question though
let's see let's see mr. Bob 20 to you
our cards with pre-installed water
blocks good generally yeah I mean it's
gonna depend on the PCB though so it
might be a custom PCB with better power
delivery standards higher power
tolerances more overclocking Headroom
stuff like that you got to find out what
the PCB exactly is if it's a Founders
edition card it's no different in
overclocking terms than a regular you
know GTX 1080 by from a video store so
you got a look at the PCB and one more
one more let's see something good
something good let's see here something
good let's see I see Nathaniel turkmen
GS 65 stealth in opinion I looked at it
I don't like the way those look I did I
like smaller form factor of laptops my
epic exper might drool over because it's
just like the perfect size 13 inches
thirteen point nine inch screen no
bezels basically and it's got a
dedicated graphics chip in it so - I
would go for that over gaming laptop
just because I don't like how how
terrible gaming like gaming laptop
batteries are there their batteries like
they drain so quick and I mean at that
point why if you had to keep it plugged
in everywhere you go just build the
desktop anyway let's see let's see I see
you guys 4k high refresh rate at a good
price you're not gonna find that 4k 60
Hertz is all you're gonna find at a good
price at this point let's see let's see
nice Irish Patel do you think the price
of the 1060 will drop after new GPU
outcome that's a good question and let's
go ahead and we'll end there I see mr.
KF camión that's your question as well
cuz your your a channel members I'll get
to you in a second - but Sarge I will
say this if it's anything like it was
last time around right with Maxwell
falling behind Pascal when it was
released we saw prices of like 960 YZ
959 77 fall about a hundred bucks or so
apiece we talked about a little bit
the live stream but my anticipation is
that when these new cards are launched
which will be very very very soon we
will see gradual price drops obviously
these cars are going to be released
instantly not going to get your hands on
one instantly I'm sure there will be
shortages and stuff like that there were
there was last time but if it's anything
like last time release Pascal's release
I would say that 1060 is going to drop
to roughly 200 bucks if it drops any
lower than that I'd say it's gonna be a
really good deal because anything over
200 bucks for 1060 or comparable 980
performance you know if you want talk
about Maskell or Maxwell performance is
a really good value but it's not going
to drop to 200 bucks instantly it'll
take time and if it drops below 200
bucks and then money in my opinion
because 10 60s right now are still
around 250 $300
it's tough they've always been slightly
more expensive than their rx
counterparts but they're good cards
there's definitely thing wrong with a
1060 and mr. KF gaming hey Greg what's
smart which smartphone are you most
hyped about for each Oh which smartphone
you most hype for each year I see I
really like what LG does I've been using
the V 30 for quite a while
I love the V 30 and I think that I think
in general LG does really cool things
with their phones I think the g7 looks
stupid though I'll say that like they
have the knotch
and they have a chin I think it was a
terrible choice they should've done when
iPhone did and just go with no chin but
I feel like they were limited by their
technology maybe but the V I like the V
Series the V 30 is a really good phone
the V 35 e30 plus all those different
variants of the B 30 I really like those
so LG keeps me on my toes I also am
looking forward to the pixel 3 and it's
really about it I mean obviously what I
would Apple does next as well just
because I like seeing what weird new
innovative thing Apple's gonna do so
we'll see by the way yes tech crimson a
link to the discord you can check out
the discord link down below as well if
you want to join our open public discord
you can chat with myself you can chat

there's a lot of questions here I try to
answer as many as I could within an hour

I eat I get lazy and I sit down on the
couch and fall asleep so I got that plan
