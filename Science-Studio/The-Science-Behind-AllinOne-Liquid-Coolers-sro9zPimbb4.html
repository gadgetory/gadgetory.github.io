lot of heat now some of them generate
more of it than others I discussed this
in more detail right here also why CPUs
generate heat in the first place but in
this video I want to talk about the
all-in-one a liquid cooler how it works
and why you might consider one our model
an example today is the Aero cool p7 L
240 this AO boasts a 240 millimeter
aluminum radiator copper CPU block and
full on RGB support you can even fill it
yourself which is reffering AIO now in
its basic form from start to finish the
cpu block typically copper or nickel
plated conducts heat generated by the
processor underneath liquid in the loop
moves through a series of tiny channels
canikin to the block absorbing energy
from the system below the idea here is
to pull energy heat away from the CPU it
is then pushed through a tube to the
radiator where small channels run on one
side from top to bottom and then from
bottom to top on the other it is here
where tiny fins pull energy away from
the heated water and where fans aid in
transferring this waste heat to the air
contrary to their names radiators
transfer majority of their heat via the
process of convection not radiation now
most of these AOS have a small pump
hidden in the CPU block which is
responsible for churning the fluid
without it water would lose its
transferable abilities and the closed
system would become extremely
inefficient which is not what we want
the liquid in most a iOS is water-based
because it has a relatively high heat
capacity meaning that it can absorb
large quantities of heat before it
physically becomes hotter by 1 degree
Kelvin or Celsius or Fahrenheit
depending on your units the lt40 from
arrow pool in particular sports are
relatively low fin densities something
to look out for roughly 18 per inch
which is a tad lower than the industry
standard but this is actually better
from a noise standpoint and doesn't
require fans with higher static pressure
the mixture of aluminum and copper
usually sets off a few alarms for those
with a tuned ears but galvanic corrosion
is mitigated thanks to special
properties and special chemicals in the
liquid that I mentioned earlier most AIO
manufacturers opt for a copper block and
aluminum radiator for a few reasons
firstly aluminum rads are cheaper than
her copper counterparts so saving
wherever you can the metal is also
lighter which saves weight especially
during shipping and it's lower density
means that heat readily radiates now
copper is a better conductor of heat and
I don't want to get into like the you
know the specifics about whether or not
copper is a better radiator of heat or
if it retains heat more than aluminum
does because aluminum is less dense but
what you should know is the copper is
generally not used for radiators of you
know AIO calibers because it just is
more expensive overall now pay close
attention to this part because this
seems to get so many people confused and
aggravated in a nutshell combining both
metals in a closed system is a no-no but
anti corrosive additives and the fluid
keep things in check for several years
most radiators from Corsair NZXT to
arrow covariants utilize this config
don't freak out
lastly I want to bring up a radiator
placement you'll find a few videos
addressing this in great detail but to
be blunt into the point because some of
those videos last 10 or so minutes
placing your radiator up front is ideal
for most users utilizing open-air
graphics cards the front mount allows
the fans to pull in fresh air providing
a stark enough difference in temperature
to cool the liquid and loop
appropriately just make sure you're
using a case with decent enough front
airflow we learned our mistakes in 2017
regarding that by the way for those
still watching I want to ask all of you
a question whether or not you prefer a
iOS in general or air coolers now I
understand the arguments for both I have
used both and I can say that it really
depends on the system it depends on the
budget in most cases I would I would
prefer to opt for either a really beefy
air cooler or an AI oh that doesn't cost
more than about a hundred or so US
dollars the reason why I think that that
should be the cutoff for an AO is
because if you want to spend any more
than that you're usually not paying for
the extra TDP right the ability for that
for the AO to take more heat from your
CPU which would give you better
overclocks
most of the time you're just paying for
added features like RGB support and
better fans maybe something along those
lines of memory go quieter system but
hey I was in general aren't going to be
perfectly silent you will hear the pump
more than likely you might hear the
fluid churning and the fans generally
included are decent but not the best now
if you go with an air cooler you're
gonna have the advantage of usually a
cheaper overall CPU cooler and on top of
that it's not going to require any
maintenance at all you really want to
wear
by anything breaking save the fan and
even if that breaks you don't have to
worry about your system completely
overheating because you still have a
pretty decent heatsink there to give you
some sort of passive cooling for the
time being that said they can get pretty
loud and most of them to do not include
very nice fans what I can say about the
l 240 from aro cool is that this thing
is actually pretty good for what you're
paying a bit pricey but you do get to
fill the loop yourself if you want to
get really fancy with it and the RGB
support is something you're paying an
extra for but it's gonna look pretty
darn good in your case if you liked this
