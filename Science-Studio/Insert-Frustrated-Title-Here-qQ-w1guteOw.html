me and tech that form such an
incompatible relationship sometimes but
every once in a while I do have
something malfunction on me or I do
something that it inverting Lee causes a
system crash or dead component whatever
and in this case well I don't think I
did anything wrong I was doing with
swapping cards pcs off you know you hold
the power button down for 20 30 seconds
make sure all the power strain of the
caps and I was swapping the cards
because I was benchmarking Vegas 64
check out this video right here for that
also Vegas 60-56 coming up here soon and
then I put the 10 atti back in here just
because that's the card that's usually
in this rig and the computer would boot
up and then shut off about 20 seconds
later and keep cycling over and over and
over mind you the only thing changing
the only variable involved here is the
graphics card this card worked perfectly
fine with the PC before I tested Vega I
know that Vega didn't cause this problem
at least I'm fairly certain it didn't I
wouldn't have any way of proving that
anyway but we're not gonna focus on that
I'm just gonna tell you how I diagnosed
it and what this means for this
particular PC
so I'm really glad that the gigabyte Z
270x designer motherboard which I
reviewed right here by the way has a
debug interface so down at the bottom
right you'll find there are four little
LEDs and they check for CPU DRAM VGA and
boot stability and when I turn the PC on
with all four dims installed I'll go
ahead and do that just so you guys can
see what I'm experiencing here the LED
notification light down at the bottom
here flickers between CPU and DRAM it
stays on DRAM tries to move over to the
CPU and then comes immediately back to
DRAM stays there for about three or four
seconds and just keeps alternating like
that and ultimately what will happen is
the computer will still try to boot
anyway after cycling through these two
notification lights at the bottom and
then shut off basically the power trips
and it tries to reboot again just repeat
the same process so any second now the
computer will shut off any second now
and there it goes and it'll try to boot
up again and if you notice the LEDs
around the motherboard and the ones that
are synced up to the deep cool cooler
here won't turn on until the PC and I
just tries to force itself past a little
checklist here at the bottom where keeps
cycling between the DRAM and the CPU so
this saved me a bit of time like I said
though in my troubleshooting video I'm
just gonna turn this off and keep
cycling in the troubleshooting video I
said one of the first things you should
check for in terms of like
malfunctioning parts is the RAM most of
the time either you to have a properly
seated module or one of the slots of
dies that actually happened in my asrock
ATX motherboard in that video so what
I'm going to do I already know which
what's wrong here but it does involve
the RAM so I pull out three sticks just
leave one in there it doesn't matter
really which slot I mean I know there's
like a preference on the board for which
slot you should put the first module in
but we're not really gonna focus on that
because we're not sure if it's a module
issue or if it is a slot issue if one of
the slots do malfunctioning or if one or
more of the modules is dead
I'm pretty sure it's not a module issue
just going right into this because this
isn't Rann me pick up in an alley
somewhere and sketch villian this is
either Corsair down plats so I don't
know why I took the elastic out but I'm
going to just insert
one dim on the far outside right slot
and see if we get a post we're gonna
check the LED interface down at the
bottom and so we're not getting the
flashing anymore let's see it's moving
to VGA check and we're good so this is a
post you can tell the BIOS configuration
is kicking in because all the fan cars
have dropped now and this is stable so
this actually works I plugged it into
the computer into the monitor and made
sure that this was a functioning system
so one stick of RAM on the outside slot
is good to go now there are two things
we can do from here on out we could
start moving this module through each of
the slots thing if it's a slot problem
or we could cycle through all four the
dims and see if it's a module problem
I'm pretty sure it's not a Dom platt
issue just gonna say that right off the
bat I have faith in the Corsair Don
Platt series so we're going to assume
it's a slot issue we're gonna stick with
one card and we're gonna continue moving
it through slots one two and three and
there we go so second slot is
functioning properly now we're gonna
move it to the two innermost slots with
two closest to the CPU and see if one of
those is in fact dead so we are getting
the led swap here on slot three or this
is actually on the board DDR slot - so
the second closest to the CPU socket and
so the motherboard you know led to turn
on is the thing tries to post and then
it shuts off randomly just like that so
that tells me that slot two on the board
is dead now just so that we're sure
we've dotted all of our eyes we're gonna
try the innermost slot now and see if
some reason we have two dead slots
instead of one just for peace of mind
sake and we're getting the same LED
cycle so actually is that ddr4 slot four
and slot two are both dead and I don't
know what could have caused that I mean
other than just swapping out the
graphics cards I haven't touched
anything up top I did install this
cooler but I mean really like what could
I have done with that in cooler
installation that would have killed too
ooh RAM slots that's a little weird so
the last thing we can do just to make
sure again for peace of mind sake is
swap the modules just to make sure that
these are still functioning properly in
the slots that we know are working on
the board I've already done that not
gonna waste your time these are all
still perfectly fine so don plats again
very reliable and this is pretty much
where I have to call it quits for this
video I'm just gonna go ahead and army
this board I have my gigabyte contact
and we're gonna see if we get a
replacement I cannot speak to what
caused the issue it's just I mean it's a
fluke thing and it just seems to happen
to me more so than any other tech tuber
on YouTube
the good thing is though at least you
learn a few troubleshooting tips if you
didn't already check out the
troubleshooting guide you can click this
video right here if you like this video
or at least not feel bad for me press f4
respects and you can also hit the like
button I do appreciate that click your
subscribe button if you haven't already
and stay tuned for more interesting
stuff here on the channel this is
