here in the studio thanks to studio pros
2000 watt light kit I have one of them
set up and currently using right now
bear with me the camera
calibrations aren't perfect just yet I'd
literally set this thing up five minutes
ago so if it's a little overexposed or
you know the white balance isn't correct
it's just because I haven't really had
time to fiddle with it yet but I didn't
want to show you firsthand how to set
one of these things up and what you
should expect in terms of video quality
and picture quality improvement thanks
to having just a single one of these
thousand watt light kits or two of them
like I have here for a total of 2000
watts of 5500 k's studio lighting action
first thing I do is open up the stand
box it's the long narrow box and the
state is actually decent quality I've
noticed that the Studio Pro really
didn't cheap out here where they
honestly could have but all you got to
do is just loosen this little bracket
right here there's this little screw and
then you're good to go so expand the
three legs and then just push it down
you see we have a nice wide stand you
can go for something that's a bit
narrower not as stable but you get the
point so we'll go with a fairly wide
stance here and then you have three
adjustments up top and these are
identical to the one down below and
these will of course control the height
of the panel if you want the panel
exceptionally high you definitely have
that option with this kind of stand
we're talking upwards of eight feet so
plenty of versatility in terms of the
vertical form factor so what you're
looking at here is a single bar length
this is extended all the way and that is
about two and a half feet and of course
we have the other two here that we can
extend to the same height so yeah at
least eight feet here I'm actually gonna
stretch it out all the way and see how
high we can get this thing just just
because I am curious so again just
loosen this it's spring-loaded so you
know when it's set properly and
looking at that's a little a little
lower a little shorter than the other
poll and then the last one up top does
the same thing yeah we're going we're
coming to the ceiling so if you want
this one to be a little higher than I
guess the one that you're using as your
primary lighting panel then you can
certainly do that with this raise this
up as high as you want and then angle
the actual LED panel on the top of it
downward just make sure that once you do
have these at their desired Heights you
tighten the screws to make sure they
don't slide up and down you don't want
something like that happening in the
middle of filming and you do have well
it's fairly expensive bulbs up top you
don't want those to break either if the
whole panel suddenly came crashing down
and what we have here is the five bulb
housing nothing really special on the
front but this is what's cool on the
back they don't just give you a one
switch we can just turn on one and all
the light bulbs are shining at full
power you do have sort of a dimming
option here so instead of just keeping
on all five you can turn off either the
bottom left on top right just the center
or the top left and bottom right and of
course you can configure these however
you like for that unique lighting effect
that you're going for the power
connector is a standard three prong
connector you would use on a typical
power supply for PC and the cable
included with each housing in this kit
is about ten feet long I don't know the
exact measurement but it is
significantly longer than those included
with typical power supplies mean which
means that you can pretty much place
this kit wherever you want the each LED
panel and I'll have to worry about
needing some kind of cable extension to
get it where you need it to be and
lastly we have the mounting system to
screw complexes here nothing fancy this
one controls the angle of approach that
you're like it will have with your
subject so you can kind of just bend
this very well it's very sturdy that's a
good thing it's it is built fairly cheap
it's plastic but it is sturdy that's
good for especially bulbs like these and
then this this grew over on this side is
what fastens the housing to the tripod
system just make sure this is loose and
just slide it over the top of the stand
and then screw it tight any wart no it's
not going anywhere
you can't loosen this and kind of just
so instead of moving the entire the
entire stand whoops instead of moving an
entire stand you can just slide the kid
around so that's something that I think
is very cool to give you that option
there and then also like I said before
controlling your your lighting angle all
done with this one over here on this
side once you have that set accordingly
again just tighten it and you're good to
go very secure and firm lamp stand now
here is what a standard studio pro bulb
looks like this is what you will have
included with your kit it is a 45 watt
5500 K bulb which means that this light
will be roughly truewhite it's not going
to be very warm nor cool it should be
fairly close to just neutral white which
is good that's what you want especially
for camerawork standard hundred and ten
volts 60 Hertz and it just screws right
in to the bulb housing system simple as
that and you're good to go
something else worth mentioning each of
these bulbs is packed properly they're
not just floating around in cardboard
boxes with no support I think each of
these bulbs is wrapped around or wrapped
inside of a styrofoam mold Studio pros
not sponsoring this video by that I
didn't say that originally but they
didn't sponsor this video I paid for the
these kits out of my own pocket
but I do want you guys to to feel safe
about buying an LED kit like this I do
have this one and I'm just getting it
giving my impressions as I go it would
suck if one of these just was delivered
broken or just didn't work you know I do
have nine other bulbs so it wouldn't be
that catastrophic but if you do happen
to have one that doesn't work out of the
box be sure to send studio pro an email
there email is in this video's
description if you have a problem with
any of their products they'll be very
prompt from what I've heard they their
customer service is excellent
just give them a try you know don't
don't just drop them altogether because
you had one bad product it's likely not
even their fault they packed the product
properly shipping just like I said isn't
perfect
right inside the studio pro accessory
bag you'll get two of these one for each
of the panels is basically a kit for
setting up your diffuser now you'll have
four of these rods for keeping it nice
and sturdy and rigid and then you'll
have the you'll have the backdrop of
diffuser which is reflective which is
good for getting that light outside
pushing it forward and then two
diffusers one small the fuser inside of
I don't know if this if there's some
professional word for this I'm not a
lighting Pro you have a diffuser inside
of the actual diffuser on the outside so
I'll show you right here to what I'm
using so this is one diffuser this is
one that wraps around the entire light
panel and then there's another smaller
diffuser inside of this one I kind of
get to cut off right here and it's
further in but both bees act to diffuse
light basically spreads it out and
doesn't make it a blotchy to the point
where you don't have one area of your
animal filming scene being more bright
than somewhere else it kind of spreads
the light out evenly for that nice
professional feel my first up you're
gonna have the backdrop this is what
will cover the back side of the panel
and kind of spread the light forward it
just helps disperse the light forward or
not backward but you can see the outside
here coated with the it still feels
plasticky but it is it's not cheap it
just it just feels the plastic I don't
describe that but you see the inside is
coated with a reflective material good
for getting that light outward in the
forward direction it will have four
areas for velcroing I don't recommend
doing this until the very end
so you're gonna want to attach all of
these immediately and then wrap them
around the old housing now it's not
gonna feel like it wants to stay up at
first is because we have nothing
supporting it now these are the rods
that keep the entire panel kind of
together you need to have these there
are going to be four of them for each
kit and they're gonna run from the knot
corners of these housings of each of
these bulb housings to the corners of
the diffuser itself these little inserts
right here where I was pointing to a bit
earlier bear in mind that the ends of
these rods are slightly different so
this side is a bit thing
than this side so this side is the part
we're gonna want to insert into the
actual cover itself and then the slimmer
side will be inserted into not this one
here it depends on which way you orient
the actual cover but we'll be inserting
them into the corners down here up here
and then likewise on the other side the
manual recommend starting with the cover
side first so remember the larger end of
the rod into the velcro corner and then
the other end of the rod be careful not
to slap any of these bulbs little too
hard the under end rod is gonna come in
to one of the corners I showed you on
the bulb housing it just slides right in
just make sure that it's angled
correctly or it won't it won't want to
do that see just like that
and there we go so now we have both the
and you can't see it there but we have
both both the top left and top right
connecting rods in place so you can see
how it's kind of setting up our cover
here it's making it seem a bit more a
rectangular like it's supposed to so
again start with the corner of the cover
run it down the side make sure that your
Stan doesn't you know fall on you you
are applying quite a bit of force to get
these connecting rods in place just like
that and we only have one more to go
and just like that okay afterwards you
can just velcro the back corners will be
a little difficult depending on how much
tension you have on the box itself but
this will keep light from bleeding out
of the back of the entire panel
okay and there we go looks pretty good
doesn't it now the last thing we have to
worry about are the two diffusers this
installation is much simpler than the
for support rods so you see this is the
interior diffuser I was talking about
this connects to the four little elastic
bands here on the inside of the back
cover and then we have our large
diffuser that wraps around the frame and
then connects via velcro straps in the
middle of each of the four sections a
simple little clip right here I'm not
the biggest fan of these kinds of clips
on elastic bands but it's better than
nothing okay diffuser number one is
installed now time for diffuser number
two and this one is the simplest of the
two no cheap elastic bands to worry
about this just simply wraps around the
frame like so and it fits rather snug on
its own you don't even need the velcro
straps to be honest but you do have them
to kind of keep the guess the middle of
each side in place and that's it velcro
the corner well the sides not really
corners I guess and that's it boom there
you go that's an entire light panel so I
have my camera's exposure turned as low
as it will go this panels super bright
and see how dark my hand is but the
panel is on all five lights are on and
you can just barely make out the five
locations of the bulb so the diffuser is
doing a great job of dispersing light
not perfect but this isn't an ultra
expensive light kit this is definitely
for people on budgets and I mean just
looking at it while it's very brightly
exposed we just turn the camera this way
you can see it pretty much just evens
out especially in a moderate lighting
scenario you can't make out the
individual locations of each of the
bulbs okay and this is how I want to end
the video don't worry the light panels
are not
on this is the before so this is what I
typically use just the natural lighting
in this apartment the lights themselves
are very warm so when I use just the
standard auto white balance the camera
isn't doing a great job at adjusting to
that orange hue so you're seeing a very
orange image and the image itself the
video is very murky very blurry there
are a lot of spots everywhere it's just
not a very clean video overall but I'm
gonna turn the panels on right now huge
difference now it's super bright the
cameras doing its own thing adjusting
the exposure and the auto white balance
all that stuff I don't usually tinker
with much of that unless I'm in a very
special situation but it is very bright
these panels are excellent I'm well lit
I have both of them on there about I
guess 30 degrees from my left and right
and it's you know it's just a very
well-built system and I'm very pleased
with the panels I'll be using these and
probably every video that I film in my
studio and the good thing is now I can
film at night without having to worry
about using crappy indoor lighting
