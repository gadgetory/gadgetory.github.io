suggests we're going to throw a risin
plus namely the 2700 X into a be 350
motherboard this will be a really short
video I'm going to talk about the
process behind how to do that not the
CPU installation but how to update your
BIOS so that the board will be
compatible with Rison plus and then
we're gonna see if we can hit the same
overclocks on the 2700 X that we were
able to hit with a pretty boss X 470
board from MSI if you haven't already
seen my 2700 X review video I invite you
to watch that first I click in this card
right here otherwise we're gonna jump
right into it first off by updating that
UEFI the mother where we're gonna use by
the way is the MSI and be 350 tomahawk
Arctic it's a white PCB board I'm using
it because I think it looks really good
I think it's actually pretty good value
for the money and we're going to
eventually be comparing this to a
different platform that's the video
coming up right after this one so stay
tuned now but for now again let's go
ahead and update that UEFI so what
you're looking at now is the MSI B
through three board
paired with an EVGA 1070 TI for the 1/2
the same card we use to benchmark the
2700 X originally but the CPU in there
this time is the 17-yard X this is a
summit rich CPU and this is very
important because unless you buy them
other word brand-new like today and even
then you might not get the most
up-to-date BIOS you're gonna need that
up-to-date BIOS in order to boot
initially into the new Rison plus CPUs
out of sheer curiosity before filming
this part of the video I actually tested
the 2700 X and just straight up in here
raw doggin up without the UEFI update
and all I got was a black screen so
everything looks functional it's not
gonna give you any error code or
anything like that but you're not gonna
get an official post until the ufi is
updated so just FYI so the first thing I
want to do navigate to your motherboard
vendors website in my case it will be a
mess I just type in the full name of
your motherboard and then you can
navigate from there to the service tab
click here and then BIOS it might not be
called service by the way it might be
called something else but you'll get the
idea to be where all of the software is
stored on their website for that given
product we of course want the latest
BIOS you can see here update a GSA this
is good for the new up-and-coming
processors so go ahead and download this
and then once it saves you're gonna want
to open the folder which it saved and
act it if you click into the extracted
folder you'll find the h20 file this is
the official update here and then we
have a text file here just kind of
showing the same thing that the website
already did now this is where a thumb
drive will come in handy you're gonna
want to plug this into your system and
then drag that entire folder onto your
thumb drive make sure it's still plugged
into your PC by the way when you reboot
so again drag the entire folder
containing the BIOS into your USB Drive
and then you're gonna want to restart
your system and then keep spamming
delete until you're prompted into your
BIOS now depending on your vendor you're
gonna see an option similar to in flash
or I think in the case of gigabyte it's
called cue flash but this will basically
reboot your system and enter flash mode
for you there might be a dedicated
switch to do this without hopping into
your BIOS directly but you want to click
on this it'll say something flash and
then your system will reset and then
boot and try to look for that BIOS all
right so you're pretty straightforward
you can see this is our USB Drive with
new BIOS loaded onto it and just
according to the date here we know this
one and good old 420 here is our BIOS
click it again are you sure you want to
select this file click yes this is a hc0
file and your system will update its
BIOS by the way this process could take
a while it's been here for about 3 or 4
minutes now so don't freak out whatever
you do though just as the screen
suggests do not turn your PC off let it
run the entire time otherwise you have a
brick to bios and latha get a new chip
or just an entirely new motherboard and
another thing after it finishes flashing
your PC might reboot more than once
again just let it power cycle on its own
I don't know why it says preparing
automatic repair but again just don't
touch anything let it and correct itself
and you should be alright I think right
now it's gonna push me into recovery
mode because it just reset itself three
or four times yeah so just click
continue ok so it's still showing this
and I'm pretty sure the reason why it's
doing that is because we updated the
BIOS right so all of our settings
internally or reset I'm just going to
spam delete until we're pushed into the
BIOS instead of Windows because I think
it's trying to boot into the wrong draw
but do have a hard drive in here that
has nothing but Steam games on it so
that could be the reason why you reify
hard-disk
this is booting into yep okay so this is
trying to boot into the
into the HDD which is not correct we
want the SSD although I don't see I
don't see the Windows boot manager
option
let us try switching DBS priorities
should be in this one that's what we
want I'll begin and there we go it's now
it's going to boot into Windows boot
manager SSD there's a difference between
that and just booting into the SSD there
are different partitions so keep that in
mind all right
and we're gonna save it there we go no
more automatic repair so again you might
have to reconfigure some initial BIOS
settings if you had things set it the
way you wanted even your fan curves and
things you might have to update again
overclocks all of that and we're back in
the system no issues at all alright so
now the fun part comes up we're gonna
swap CPUs and we're gonna boot directly
into the BIOS make sure things being
read correctly and then we will try for
that four point two beer its overclock
turned off the power supply when I did
this and alright check that out so we
have a fresh boot into well almost our
BIOS and we're reading everything
correctly AMD Rison 720 700 X 16 gigs of
ram our two drives so awesome we're
gonna press f1 and boot into our BIOS
we're gonna go into advanced first click
overclock again this will vary from BIOS
to BIOS and then we're gonna go ahead
and shoot for 4.2 gigahertz again there
we go I think I was able to hit one
point three eight volts with the 2700 X
but in this case one point four is
sufficient for four point two hopefully
now regarding RAM I'm gonna go ahead and
enable XMP this is something that I was
never able to do on a be 350 board with
the original risin summit ridge CPUs so
I'm gonna go full-on hardcore here with
ddr4 3200 megahertz
these are Corsair Vengeance RGB Ram
modules this is exactly the same ones
that we used for the previous video and
this has a default on XP profile to set
to 3200 megahertz so let's just see I
doubt this will work on B 350 but let's
go ahead and give it a shot alright so
we've booted in the operating system
without a hitch and I'm pulling up
hardware info now
see if our RAM frequency stuck and sure
enough folks check it out you can see
right here it says ddr4 3200 and course
this is double data rates of 1600
megahertz here on one 8 gig dim and we'd
swap for for the other one and same
thing so it looks like these frequencies
are sticking and our CP frequencies as
well
we're gonna run prime95 here and see how
stable it actually is alright let's see
here
system is getting pretty loud but looks
like it's looks like it's stable at 4.2
gigahertz in one point nope no it locked
up there okay so yeah system's frozen
let's go ahead and power cycle I'm gonna
probably bump the voltage up there like
1.4 to 5 which is about as high as I'm
comfortable with long term and let's see
if it's any more stable alright let's
give it one more shot this time again
I'm gonna monitor package temps up top
hardware monitor does not have support
yet for full on per core temperature
readings but we'll at least get you know
a rough estimate of what our package
temps will be like with prime95
something else to stress this is like an
absolute worst case torture test so even
if it doesn't pass this per se could
still be quote unquote stable you know
with most workloads and it froze up
again so I'm gonna go ahead and call
this one a no-go at 4.2 just to be on
the safe side we're gonna clock it down
to 4 point 1 gigahertz which will allow
us to drop voltage significantly and
then we'll give this one more go alright
so here we go this time at four point
one of your Hertz and one point three
five volts which is probably higher than
I need it but I want to make sure things
are stable when we run this test and
here we go
I'm gonna keep moving the window around
just to make sure things aren't locking
up and you know if it can pass 30
seconds of prime95 like I'd call that
pretty darn stable things are looking
great package temps are approaching ADC
which is on the upper limit for sure
this is a 360 ml IO from deep cool here
not the highest TDP or the strongest
pump but things are looking pretty
stable temperatures aren't too high so
I'm gonna go ahead and call this one
here it's someone locking up yeah I'm
gonna call this one a pass you
I doubt any workload most people pursue
anyway it would be anywhere near prime95
torture workload capacity so this is uh
this is great this is great news
so yeah still not locking up here 4.1
gigahertz 1.3 5 volts on a be 350
motherboard with a rise in 720 700 X you
see package temps are getting pretty
high still despite being at only one
point three five volts 84 degrees C
according to hardware monitor but the
system is not locking up and that's
that's really good news so if you have a
be 350 board or maybe just want to buy a
cheaper board and not want to go all out
with the X 470 stuff then you can
certainly do that as long as it comes
with the most up-to-date bios supporting
pinnacle ridge and it should be good to
go so there you have it folks a few
things you should take away from this
video yes you can run Verizon plus on a
p30 board I don't think that was news to
anybody but what I was more or less
concerned about was how stable things
would be if I could reach the same
overclock as I could on an X 470 Ford
the answer to that at least for the CPU
is no I had to drop the frequency by a
hundred megahertz I probably could've
dropped it by 50 and kind of
incrementally bored my way to a certain
threshold but I'm comfortable at 4.1
like it's only a 100 mega deviation from
the high-end stuff right it's gonna cost
maybe $100 more and on top of that we
still comfortably hit our X and P
timings here and frequency for our RAM
at 3200 megahertz which is a huge
improvement over the original rise and
stuff on the be 350 platform now a
downside to using B 350 of course this
is not going to be the most stable
motherboard out there in terms of power
delivery so your viren's might get
pretty hot on the cpu like this
depending on what frequency you get it -
although pinnacle ridge in terms of
power draw is not too different from
summit ridge and that's great news again
though you're gonna lose a few other
features when you resort to be 350 over
X 370 or X or 70 now but this is good
stuff right so you can find this
motherboard link below along with a CPU
and a few other B 50 Ford's that I've
tested that I would recommend for this
particular thing also remember to keep
in mind that you can't just buy one of
these motherboards from a site like
Amazon or new egg without triple
checking that the latest BIOS is on the
board because unless you have a rise in
one CPU of which to flash a BIOS and
less using like a key flash software
that doesn't require CPU you're gonna
have just the board that won't work
CP out of the box so just something else
to keep in mind is another hurdle but
again you know if you're upgrading or if
you get the motherboard with the newest
bios already installed then you're gonna
be a-ok if you like this video we sure
let me know guys want a thumbs up I
appreciate it thumbs down for the
