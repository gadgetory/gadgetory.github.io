we have pretty much everything ready to
go we have the motherboard
this one is compatible with the Q 6600
we did double check that beforehand we
have eight gigabytes in four 2gig
variants of ddr2 here I believe these
are clocked it I want to say 866
megahertz
I'll to double check on that we do have
the Q 6600 here this is the one I
purchased if you watch the earlier build
off of ebay for I think just sixteen
dollars so nothing special but it will
definitely pull its own weight
when we finally assemble some shuttle to
you solid-state drive I regard these as
necessities at this point and then uh
but what did we get what kind of truck I
believe it was the GTX 950
that's actually the same one that I
recommended to Jacob yeah and that's
only because we can use CUDA
acceleration when we render videos so
you'll you'll basically take a lot of
stress off of the CPU yeah when it comes
to rendering it just it just helps them
as well so we have that we have the
power supply to is the other thing I
forgot this is just a 500 watt this is
more than plenty for what his computer
will be demanding under full load and
then the last piece of the puzzle is the
Corsair 400 see you guys saw me review
this I built into several times I
painted that bottom tray white but mr.
beau here is a professional painter he's
been doing this for a while now yeah so
he might he might change things up just
just a little bit getting ideas Bo I
might do a color shift in college
between maybe a blue and green did you
know so when I faced light maybe come
into my room or something you can get a
cool different video from it whichever
way I want to face the computer some
idea over here and then might earlier
any transfer it might be green next time
folks that is going to be very
interesting we will definitely follow up
with him once we assemble this thing
speaking of which let's go ahead and get
started the Q 6600 is going in there and
mr. Bo's gonna do all the work so uh Bo
here you go
you go alright alright it is in there
alright I got you install CPU okay now
with the RAM you want to align the notch
on the actual dim with the notch on the
motherboard so grab both corners right
here yep push down and push down pretty
hard
all right there you go all four sets of
ramps we have eight gigs in total been a
while since I've tinkered with the t4 I
already know what I'm doing
hey go see you probably wing this with I
even look in the manual is just do it
without looking at a man you should be
alright okay I all right here we go
second up add a tiny bit more than that
just a tiny bit more than yeah a tiny
bit more a little more doesn't hurt a
little less is its catastrophic that's
perfect perfect folks what do you think
what do you think let me know in the
comments below what you would rate that
out of ting I'm gonna leave this one up
you may this is you this is all you that
cable right there this powers your fan
and control its pwm so it'll base pulse
width modulation which so we want to
plug that header into this this lead
into the header on the board that says
CPU fan something along those lines this
right here is the i/o shield you're
going to put this right in there snaps
into place this is one of those things
we all have to go through this part yep
so use that as your guide let's see how
well he does on this first attempt folks
good looking good and then just check
the standoff we're sitting on it we're
not it isn't supposed to beep oh you
know what it might just be a screw and
one time I said sure looks a line check
all the other holes and make sure
they're lined up in holes and everyone
I'm impressed first attempt you did that
quick and I usually do it yep you have a
small screwdriver I did not bring there
she is
uh-oh folks this is not Mystere Mako
this is a christen Bo's Pomeranian
Trixie 13 years old she's all gone 13
years oh hello they're all perfect
exactly what we need us to do let's do
the biggest one get more torque that way
is that a magnetic screwdriver sure hope
so sure hope so
that's why you don't go with cheap ones
hmm mmm this will be fun
all right good luck there so if you drop
one of those screws we're gonna have to
flip the whole case over Ashley get that
one screwed on magnetic one now there we
go it's not bigger but oh my goodness it
makes things so much so much easier see
there folks I recommend it
all the dirty behind-the-scenes work
you're getting right here folks you
can't you can't pay for this
hey this is just gotta get it at you
don't well you can't pay donations go to
donations go to Bojangles what is it at
I I Bojangles underscore heylia that
folks as my philosophy folks cable
managed as you go looking good okay so
got the motherboard installed we have
cpu install the RAM installed and the
CPU cooler installed along with the some
minor cable management from the cpu fan
cable running through the back the case
now I guess it's just up to you now but
what do you wanna do next we have the
power supply the solid-state drive the
graphics card what you what's your
feeling the graphics card is close oh
he's going with the graphics card next
folks ok jumping the gun a little bit
all right no problem no problem you
don't know you don't uh still use VGA do
you Deebo I'm just past that just last
weekend oh-ho last week what we on HDMI
now yeah my man you just gonna slide it
in basically just align it that the
metal prongs on the back of the card
should miss the motherboard perfect and
then just slide it on in there there you
go just like that you installed a
graphics card I see we're gonna want to
screw this but exactly now the key here
to eliminate any potential graphics card
sag is you're gonna want to hold this
upright while you screw it in just like
that I should say bow has been like a
painter for the past 4 like this guy huh
paint anything you want like he could
paint like just a tiny little portion of
something somewhere and it would look
like it was professionally done this guy
painted rims and cars like whole cars
and it just it looked like a stock pan
shot it was that good so I did be
interesting to see what Bo decides to
deal with this case and with the
components inside should he should he
desire to paint any other stuff I have a
feeling of a feeling you're gonna want
to you know put some mention what color
y'all think we look cool down the
comments in there yo you know oh it
looks kind of every other week yeah oh
man we're gonna have one of them like
color change in color change in CTCs Oh
something good look at that let's think
we have any GPU sag here um mmm very
very minimal like we're talking less
than a degree of sag looking good I like
that
I like that it's a light card so that
helps too now what's next we have
solid-state drive and we have the power
supply you know I don't know at all what
this is or where it's gonna fit leave
that that's okay I'm gonna see McLovin
thought this was the power supply okay
yeah he yeah he did something but this
one's a little bigger and so I probably
a smart man probably woulda waited with
the graphics card cuz it's a little more
room to work that's the only reason
people tend to go with a PSU first but I
mean I know I make this look like he's
coming but this is good 15 pounds good
thing baby some curls with that thing
maybe that writing there but you got a
good 500 watt here this thing will be
practically silent even while the PC is
under full load that's why I love these
EVGA power supplies I recommend them to
any budget conscious builder who seeks
advice so if you have a question about a
power supply and don't need anything
expensive or ostentatious go with an
EVGA 500 or 600 watt or if you have a
super super chill passive system that
doesn't demand a lot of power at all
even if for 30 watt would be just fine
this one fan we're gonna want to insert
facing downward because we do have an
air filter a dust filter down here that
you can remove and clean over time there
so yep just like that you don't want to
just slider in make sure them cables are
out where are we gonna want them down
there or since you can push them like
that yeah that's why I work yep in order
to get a fully modular 500 watt on your
most instances we're talking about
probably double the price so I think
it's worth putting up with the cables
what you think Bo absolutely yeah just
good just comes out of preference but in
most cheap budget builds I wouldn't
recommend a modular power supply I'm
very excited about the benchmarks of
this PC I think it's pcs gonna perform
admirably alright so last thing to do is
a install a solid-state drive I mean go
and do that before we start wiring
everything up because you'll need to
wire that one up anyway
ah biggest ones going to something
important mm-hmm all right gonna start
with um first one
don't tell me oh it's right there the
big white okay oh that's in a very
unorthodox place to be completely honest
with you we almost kept this in there we
need to be mindful of this eight pin CPU
power connector up here so we decided to
run the 24 pin across the GPU across the
whole motherboard and it's not the
prettiest looking but you know it's much
it's a lot more functional and if we
ever have to remove the bottom panel all
we have to do is unhook the eight pin
from here and then the peripherals are
the front io pins down there that should
be it now all we have to do is power the
solid state drive and and then we'll
plug in the front io connectors and then
run a SATA cable from the SSD to the
motherboard and then we'll wire up the
LEDs starting with this block up here
and then cable managed and then put the
panels back on and then boom boom ready
to install the operating system and yeah
start playing around this thing see how
powerful it actually is oh go ahead and
have that back in yeah that's good
I've been too much force so your
solid-state drive is now powered kind of
wrap those cables you can kind of try to
tuck them under here we'll get some tie
straps in time over here too if you want
one other thing we do need a power our
are your LEDs so that's a molex power so
you see four distinct pins pull up the
four distinct pins power leads from your
power supply it'll be none of those
it'll be all on the same hip just like
that and now all we need is a single
SATA cable and that is in my box of
goodies my ziplock bag of goody this
thing all right here folks a bunch of
good stuff in here
we need one SATA cable and
okay and pull one out of there yep
yeah let's go okay so we get that in and
from the backside here mm plug the other
end of that state of cable into the
solid state drive right there I'm gonna
wait to check the manual to see where
these putting these are this is for the
front panel and there's no var no
markings on board I'm assuming it's
going to go in one of these that's fine
but uh we want to make sure we plug
those in correctly okay so here's the
picture this is what we need our power
LED positives on the far left up top our
power LED negative is two pins to the
right of that so I'll have that one and
then we'll have our power switch so i
power in our grounds this is positive
negative and then our reset switch reset
and ground so positive negative again
and so now all we have left do oh you've
already kind of cable age-1 come on back
here and check this up okay maybe did a
pretty good job considering what we had
to work with keep in mind we had to use
they know I'm launching a power supply
so all these extra cables get on
thinking is we just stuck down there
underneath the basement but it looks
pretty good I'd say it goes bad we see
we have LEDs on the inside there's a
little grocery I don't know of course it
does on purpose for LED strips if you
wanted to insert them but it worked out
that's where I put them so we have them
here and then our cable leads we're
going to plug these into these two cable
leads on the coming from the little
power supply cord way up top and then
then we close it up power it on see if
everything works so one um is good yeah
what unfinished your male to female the
problem is we got female to female down
here which believe it or not I can I can
do that confidently myself you know all
right so I'm gonna get a couple shots of
the front that's what it looks like
that's the finished product I'm not
turned on for ya here only you mishit
monitors on the ceiling
is you see a blue light yep blue lights
huh
okay let's see what happened that's the
PC okay make sure the power on the power
supply is on it was already switched it
is do we have the LED remote I'll but
I'll leave you in charge of that good we
have a green light on the motherboard
that's good sign you know and ready
3q 100 huh huh so we get a post good
sign it's a good sound we have color
folks and of course it's not gonna post
this would have the operating system
installed yet so let's go ahead and do
that next let's go over to boot we're
gonna set our boot device priority first
to our USB exit and safe so now the
computer reboots we should automatically
be thrown into those ten okay so the
computer's seems to be doing okay and
we've installed the operating system
right now we are getting ready to boot
into the OS for the first time got you
are gonna see this cat fetch check this
out look at look at her go you see that
do you see that she just brought this
thing back that is the smartest cat I've
ever seen in pattern - yeah reward she's
smarter than our than my pups sup buddy
what's up with that if she knows she's
like ya know ya know
hi there hi there hey we are in we are
in the windows tempo how do you feel
about that fantastic we got a new
upgrade we're gonna be able to play some
better games it better freight rates
with everything you know and our second
set of LEDs is actually not plugged in
at this point because we don't have the
converter but I'll bring that one to him
I know I have one in the office
somewhere and the second set down here
will be on as well to light everything
up even more than it already currently
is so let's get the installing some
drivers and then run some quick test
benches before I get out of here because
I
but wants to start playing that csgo
he's been waiting he's been waiting and
I don't want him to wait much longer so
I stay tuned okay we're gonna go ahead
and run Cinebench here we can see our
CPUs fairly quiet and stable at a chili
walnut chili with 36 37 degrees Celsius
so let's go ahead and run Cinebench now
okay so our score was 235 which isn't
all that great don't worry about this
being cut off we're dealing with that on
separate issue the more incentive we
have now to overclock so let's go ahead
and try to do that this is a p5q
motherboard I believe we have support
for it so let's hop into the BIOS real
quick so our Q 6800 is now overclocked -
we just did a modest 3 gigahertz here
but we should see a fairly substantial
boost in our score I'm expecting around
300 + core temps toward 60 to 63 see
across all four and keep in mind that's
with the high 44 so pretty good we might
aim for 3.2 gigahertz and then call it a
day and our final score 286 so we're
right on the edge of 300 CB ah let's go
ahead and over puggle just bit a bit
more so but when I were just talking uh
you know he was saying if I want to
upgrade the future what should I upgrade
to you know what am I expecting to pay
and it just ultimately depends on on
what you know what you're looking for
power wise this is good enough to get
them started but I told them as you know
the q 6600 here cost me 16 bucks on ebay
16 dollars you can't get any modern CPU
anywhere close to that price that will
perform as well as this thing is so
you're getting for 16 bucks of CPU
that's getting a score of 325 C be
overclocked to 3.4 gigahertz and we did
bump our V core to 1.4 I told Bo if
anything happens you know I get some
blue screens in little games whatever
just call me and we'll fix it it looks
to be stable at one point four volts and
three point four gigahertz bo are you uh
happy with what you got so far I'm very
excited to you know get started on
YouTube and lemma games and enjoy it
yeah that's gonna be very enjoyable
alright folks so uh this is it this is a
his corner for now he's gonna do a lot
of a lot of furniture moving and all
that getting his new
new a corner set up he's got a nice
l-shaped desk and a nice banking monitor
on the way right bow oh yeah yeah he's
only hearing actually he's gonna be
setting it up so for some we'll do some
Davey benchmarks in this I guess they
wouldn't hurt to download a couple games
I have my hard drive I can bring over
here to one day and we'll just benchmark
the heck out of this thing we'll see
really how well this thing handles
handles gaming and video editing so when
you start video as well I'll bet you
should see how well it does but for now
folks 325 C be on the set of inch score
that is not bad stay tuned for those
gaming benchmarks for now not a bad
build for what 350 400 bucks
yeah runner bucks nice nice go hard</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
