you all a video covering the fan text
and though pro M acrylic and that is
what you're about to see so when I first
received this case in the mail I was
actually a bit shocked it was larger in
person than it appeared to be on Amazon
and Newegg the pictures made it look
much smaller than it was in person I was
assuming this was supposed to be a
standard you know mid sized ATX tower
it's actually a bit larger than that I
was afraid that it was going to fit in
my little bookshelf back here I didn't
think it would be you know short enough
to fit underneath the top level there
but as you can probably tell it does fit
just barely this about an inch to give
on the top and on the sides so I'd say
it's a perfect fit the large acrylic
side window hence the name fantex entha
pro-am acrylic yes it's a very very long
name was the first feature that caught
my eye but that was probably because of
the large piece of cardboard that was
covering it and it was sticky cardboard
I didn't think cardboard could be sticky
but they put some kind of adhesive in
between the little cardboard layer and
the acrylic itself that was a pain to
get off but when you think about it it's
kind of cool that it was there because
it basically meant that the glass wasn't
going to be scratched I'm gonna say
glass instead of plastic a few times in
this video just ignore that
I mean acrylic it's plastic it's not
real glass but it looks pretty darn
close to glass a plastic sheet was also
covering the inside of the panel I will
admit the acrylic side panel does seem
like an afterthought and it was because
the Mpho Pro M had already existed for
much longer than this variant has but I
don't mind the tedious assembly process
for flat screws hold the window into
place it is however much easier to
assemble when it's laying outside and
not when it's standing up much harder to
install that acrylic window when it's
standing up take my word for it
just take my word for it now the front
side of the case is rather bare save the
large air intake grille upfront capable
of supporting a 280 millimeter radiator
and if you haven't noticed the optical
drive bay up top yeah that's also
included just for kicks and giggles I
don't know if you still use that or not
you still use an optical drive let me
know in the comments below I'm curious
how many of you actually still use one
of those things staggered to the side
two USB 3.0 ports a microphone jack a
headphone jack and a hard disk drive LED
and reset switch combo below the front
IO on both sides are slits for allowing
air flow though bear in mind that these
are not dust proof in any fashion the
top features a very large and robust
power button with a very short travel
distance and a top grill protected by a
magnetic dust filter it's definitely a
cheap route but it gets the job done the
left side of course features the large
crystal clear acrylic window with the
right side which I'm not even going to
bother showing you being completely bare
of any feature whatsoever through the
window is a very visible fantex logo
that should have probably peeled off the
protective plastic and a large basement
compartment it's ventilated plenty wide
and non removable the power supply rests
in the back and can only be inserted
from the right hand side no mounting
bracket here a dust filter though is
included further up we find seven PCI
expansion slots a large ventilation area
for who knows what
probably just wasted space and of course
the rear i/o and space for up to a 140
millimeter radiator onto the inside
front panel we find a large mounting
bracket suitable for a tight 280
millimeter radiator squeeze and one of
those two included 140 millimeter fan
Tech's fans the grill up front as well
as the openings in the back make for
ample airflow to the right of the
motherboard platform our five plastic
plates which can be removed to house any
number of fan Tech's optional storage
brackets none of these storage brackets
are included so thanks fantex regardless
though I don't personally care about
showing off my hard disk drives nor do I
have enough of them to begin with so all
I did with these was paint them white to
match my color scheme rubber grommets
are all over the place in this case
which is a lovely thing to see and the
recessed right panel means you can stuff
plenty of cables down there a route for
your graphics card power cable is also
provided as well as a CPU power cable /
fan cable duo whatever you want to put
up there up top
speaking of which this large bracket
right here is completely removable so if
desired the optical drive tray up front
can be removed to allow up to a 360
millimetre radiator
to be stored up top technically a 420
millimeter radiator is supported but
good luck with that since the top is the
only filtered area these two fans were
my intake fans behind the interior frame
is a very delicately weaved slew of
cables and thanks to fan tax included
velcro straps had no problem routing the
thick cables from my power supply this
and the large window are my two favorite
things about this case two bracketed
hard disk or solid-state drive mounts
come included down below and are also
completely toolless you can also get the
sense for how much empty cable storage
space is down there that is so nice to
see Hardware assembly overall was clean
and efficient full-size ATX motherboards
are natively supported graphics cards as
big as your shoe will fit with room to
spare and even the most elaborate custom
water loops will fit without any issues
you'll be able to show off your fancy
power supply towards the bottom left of
the window and your favorite solid-state
drive to the bottom right your friends
and family will have front row seats to
your work of art thanks to the acrylic
version of the fan text and though
pro-am just add a few LEDs tune the fans
and throw in a touch of cable management
what a beaut
so if the case in this video has caught
your attention you want to know more
check out fan Texas website regarding
this case in particular in the
description of this video also remember
that these reviews are entirely unspun
surd I don't get paid for doing anything
like this and I also don't get these
things free I have to order them myself
out of the science studio budget so no
one's telling me to say anything these
are my wrong impressions about how I
feel about this case in particular and
all the other reviews of all the other
products I've ever done I'm not paid I'm
not sponsored just me just one guy and
yeah bunch of Technology and science
stuff it's pretty cool so if you liked
what you saw give me a thumbs up but if
you didn't give me a thumbs down and let
me know why in the comments below be
sure to leave comments and suggestions
for future videos and start discussions
