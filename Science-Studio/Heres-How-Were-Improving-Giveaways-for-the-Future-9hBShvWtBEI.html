to you all in this video about how we're
going to handle giveaways in the future
on this channel now the giveaway that we
did with Steve and Brian the triple PC
giveaway it was a great giveaway by the
way the winners were announced on
Twitter but they are right here so
you're looking at the three winners and
they should have all been contacted by
now but this giveaway really made me
realize that a lot of people are taking
advantage of it that's not really
surprise like I understand that if you
you know aren't familiar with who we are
what we do but you see hey oh that's a
PC giveaway I'm gonna go ahead and suck
at that channel I'm not knocking on the
people who are doing that that's I mean
that's the point of the giveaway we're
supposed to not only reward those who
have been here for a while but also
encouraged new people to join I mean the
whole goal of a youtuber is to grow his
or her channel so it's gotten to the
point now where I'm starting to realize
that this is being taken advantage of by
quite a number of people and I can just
tell that by the number of people who
are subscribing to the channel or
following on Twitter and then
subsequently unsub or unfollowing
immediately after they realize that they
didn't win and that's not the kinds of
people I won in this channel I want
people who want to be involved who want
to learn something or see me screw up
and learn from my own mistakes that's
the point of this channel that's why we
take a scientific approach to almost
everything that we do because everything
is a learning process so here's what
we're going to do to remedy this issue
to keep the pool from being diluted by
those who were only leeching for the
sake of the giveaway and I really
thought about how I'm going to explain
this on camera so let's see how well I
do here we're not going to use glean
anymore okay that's the first thing I've
actually terminated the pro account that
we had on there we're not gonna be using
that anymore for any giveaway that we do
specifically on this channel there might
be a few exceptions with some companies
you might work with in the future who
may stipulate the gleam be used for a
giveaway but for any personal giveaway
that I run on this channel gleam will
not be used any more now some of you
were just like yeah you know more gleam
anyway because it's plagued with issues
I get that but the way giveaways will be
handled in our channel from now on which
is the the core the meat of this video
we will not be announcing when a
giveaway begins in fact it won't even be
like a time period for which you can
enter a giveaway there won't even be
giveaway entries all there will be or
just giveaway announcements for those
who are already subscribed already
following on Twitter and
sir Graham Facebook so we'll do
giveaways based on different social
media outlets so Facebook winner might
be one of the giveaways another winner
might be from Instagram another from
Twitter and then of course from YouTube
as well which is our biggest media
outlet at this point so one of these
days I might just come onto the channel
and say hey by the way we selected a
winner for a giveaway that we didn't
mention and it's I don't know a graphics
card and the winner was Bob Schmo from
Facebook
then we'll know Bob schmoes details to
some extent because we'll have access to
some of his data at least from social
media what he releases and we'll find a
way to contact him or him us and there
you go there's the winner but we're not
actually going to say hey we're
announcing this giveaway starting now
all of you new people who are just gonna
leech off with a giveaway should
subscribe and follow just so that you
can unsubscribe and unfollow if you
don't win that is super unfair to those
who really do care about the content and
who have been here for a long time those
are the people I want to award no I do
want to encourage new people to join and
maybe this will be a way for that to
happen of course my goal here like I
said I want this channel to grow into
something bigger than it already is
but I don't want people coming here for
the sole purpose of trying to win a
giveaway that's not what I want this
channel to be about so I hope you all
can respect that or at least understand
where I'm coming from with this I don't
want people who were only here for
giveaways to be the winners of giveaways
straight up I don't want to reward them
I want to reward people who want to be
here who want to contribute to the
channel and to the things that we're
about to do with our website and with
our other social media outlets so let
this be the encouragement follow on
Instagram Twitter Facebook there's the
social media plug for you know but you
have to stay followed because if I do a
random giveaway announcement and you're
not followed on one of those outlets
that's on you and I'm not going to
reward you for just being temporarily
subscribed to a media outlet so that's
all I really wanted to say in this video
kind of just an announcement video but
if you have suggestions or tweaks for
how we're going to handle these
giveaways in the future leave a comment
in the comment section below if you're
here especially early then you'll have a
chance to talk with me personally we can
kind of hash out how we're gonna handle
this I think just in the broad sense
this is how I want to do it from now on
I think it'll be more fair for those who
genuinely care we can kind of wash out
the leeches who are just here for a
moment or two be sure to LIKE subscribe
involved any way you can if you want to
donate a patreon that's a big help for
us all that money gets recycled back
into the channel you also get a way to
personally interact with me on discord
and live Q&amp;amp;A s and stuff they're just
four patreon donors and you can do so by
clicking the patreon link down below
even a dollar helps it really does and
it all adds up so thank you for that be
sure to give this video a thumbs up for
no reason at all be sure to click
subscribe button like I said if you
haven't already and stay tuned for more
content on the channel this is science
studio thanks for chatting with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
