it should be good if I can read what if
they can read that oh ha ha ah no I said
you can't read it yet because here
you're right totally behind me the
cameras are there are you do you see
what I'm saying
here there's there's oh because this is
hiding yeah Oh nobody sound like yes I
just have a mic just sticking out like
in this space oh oh yeah yeah I think
we're good okay um okay you could turn
around or key you could do it on that
camera a lot easier because I don't has
a wider field of view I think perhaps
he's gonna get all up in this hair I
already caught I'm calling it right now
she's gonna get lols cuca says it's not
too late to call it off and that's true
my friend we have it's tonight we've
been yeah I think I've been struggling
personally with this one that's why we
didn't do it immediately following the
livestream last Sunday we didn't jump
into it money like we wanted because I'm
just not too sure yet I'm still not sure
she's never done this before so that's
it's really my biggest concern we have
two camera angles I know this camera is
pretty trashy but uh
least you can see what's going on behind
the scenes and because if she like you
know watches this side the decides
looking good at least you guys know
what's going on anyway yeah I'm going to
be reading questions trying to answer
questions there is a link at the top of
the video description actually I didn't
even include the link yeah give me a
second
let's see do I have to sign into Twitter
again yeah I'm not stunting it's waiter
again pom pom pom I didn't realize that
like there's cameras all around so I
gotta be really sneaky with this okay
yeah there we go
that's not a fast word grip ah what is
my password
yep nope that's not it
rip maybe this is it
hey alright so this post I wanted to
link this post I'm ready well anyway
it's just gonna take two okay I'm sorry
alright alright anyway it says in the
video description that we want you guys
to send your questions to the Twitter
handle yeah I have a post on Twitter I'm
answering those questions all of those
for sure well we have trouble getting to
all the questions in the chat I have the
chat pull up right here on my phone so
I'm watching it live with you guys but
if you want I also just realized that
the chat is not like updating it's
really weird how do you view the chat
publicly I had the chat open oh here we
go
YouTube sucks on alive okay there we go
alright here we go
so Pepsi you get down you and yeah so
make questions on Twitter that's kind of
the gist of it because I can guarantee
I'll get through all of those Twitter
tends to be a little more chill so I can
answer all those questions specifically
unless they're super weird and then I
will try to answer in the meantime as
many questions as I can on on the live
chat here on youtube so if you're
feeling like I'm not getting your
question answered or you know there's
just too many people asking questions
Twitter's a sure sure thing and you'll
see the post make sure that you tweet at
me via the post that links to this live
stream that way I know where to look
Cody cilok is in the chat he is one of
our awesome mods he's actually a channel

youtube meet you're right all right
let's see your Trojan gaming is it worth
waiting for Navi GPUs or am I better off
getting a gtx 1060 now i can wait for
the release if it happens sometime in q1
i have to go back and look I know we're
expecting rising to the actual log beat
the third generation of Rison but it's
officially Zen - coming up it's
supposedly in the first quarter of 2019
I'm not sure about Navi though I haven't
looked as much into that wow you're
really gripping hair out of my scalp
oh sorry when you cut you should cut
it's okay you have enough okay I just F
just just press those apps folks we got
tons of us in here haha Aaron's telling
me to take an eyebrow I'm gonna sing
with one eyebrow
oh no but I can cut you something in you
know that it looks like a mom Marco says
Greg needs a fresh fade cut with a beard
trim my give me a fade cut what yeah you
know you know what a faded you're
cutting my hair you know laughs fade is
you know you got to get the razor we
have one by the way she'll take care of
the edges and she'll trim it up but a
fade is like it's super super trim and
then it slowly gets thicker as you go
and it's like the perfect fade Pepsi
what are you doing it's you know I'm
saying so I don't think you better get
with scissors but uh yeah let's make him
bald you have to pay me a lot of money
for that one I ain't cheap I'm walking
around baldness I have to yeah just say
your price oh I do it for a thousand
bucks oh gosh what we still have to go
on our date night you wouldn't go on a
date night with me if I was bald maybe
you really are slow at cutting hair can
you like oh wait
I enter your questions we have 100 write
country Jordan range has raged as love
your content
I appreciate that Jordan Christian says
leave her a nice review ano sorry I
shouldn't turn that's pretty good a nice
review and yo hey Erin subscribe just
because I read his comment that's pretty
that's pretty dope awesome Ray Brown
small $5 super shot my TV says greetings
from I'll I love Alavi knee I don't know
I love Annie Kirkuk Jesus bazinga says
Pepsi wants a haircut bazinga wants to
cut is your hair hey the wonder that's a
good tip he says never argue with the
one who's holding those scissors that's
true that's true
that's right true I feel like I'm
getting nervous in my eyes twitching
gosh Buddha monster hey Craig why is
Vega 64 so expensive I used to be very
expensive it's not anymore I mean it
depends on where you live I can only
speak for the states I only deal really
in the States right now you can bet
Vegas 64 for about the same price as the
GTX 280 which is about where the market
should have it because they perform
comparably in most titles so 400 bucks
in that price range if it's any more
than that I mean it's gonna change
obviously from country to country
currency to currency but Vegas 64 was
expensive originally because of the
cryptocurrency crazy those cards were
launched right when that started peaking
and those cards were basically sold ever
and they're they're amazing cars to mine
with because they're just so many stream
processors compute powers really
actually excellent on those cards
especially for the money but they're
back in stock now I mean you probably
couldn't buy 20 of them at one time if
you wanted but they're you know they're
out there at least in the States
Jordan asks who cuts they were a
hairdressers hair who cut your hair
oh no you went you went back to Germany
when you got here
yeah the last time I was in Germany I
was six month ago or something but now
I'm trying to let him grow again yeah
I'm looking at the haircut like with a
30-second delay on stream and it's kind
of concerning what there's like no yeah
I can I'm sure I got the high def screen
up yeah I wasn't here yeah I'm just
doing your side first ah mythical
Phoenix is Lisa make Greg hotter than uh
9900 Kay
haha do you know what a nineteen ahead
okay is no then why are you acting like
no it is there's a black box over there
next to your feet is it that's a 9900
Kay how do you say it into say hey say
it in Germany into Intel Intel now
that's answer until 1900 mr. Minkus
water wet it's good question no no is it
well it's not really wet in and of
itself it has to wet something else
right hmm just philosophical questions
Jason says his hair is thick with two
seas that is right it really is
sometimes you're like you're really
moving really slow back there we'll take
our uh just like that we'll take the
razor and it'll just like it'll get to
stop dot they don't choke itself out
she's a hair so thick in some places
yeah it's a curse and I guess a blessing
from the sense that I don't yeah I don't
have to worry about my hair thinning too
early no I don't know my dad's got like
a pretty pretty thick head of hair still
it's still dark to you like he doesn't
have much gray hair at all except his
beard
he's like what fifty following 54:35 I
don't know the last time I always just
shave like all that like I just you know
flatten it out
let's see Jamie seven one one seven one
one hi Greg what do you think about
Nvidia continuing their anti-technology
anti-competitive practices by pushing up
a Praia Terri tech with Turing
proprietary tech I'm not sure what you
mean by that but pretty much every
company out there has some mix to some
extent has intellectual property I mean
whether or not
is anti-competitive or intel's
anti-competitive like i think you can
make the case for and against that what
I will say though is it's you know
Nvidia can if they can do it it's it's I
mean that the whole point is right to
control the markets dominate the market
so in a sense all companies want to be
anti-competitive they don't like
competition per se I think it's a little
unfair to put Nvidia in that light but
I'll have to I'll have to get more
context know what you're talking about
specifically cuz just off that you know
off the top like obviously in-video
wants to be anti-competitive oast
companies want to be cuz then if you
have no competition you can charge
whatever you want all right I mean yeah
that sucks for the consumer and that's
when you'll have in most country to have
laws in place that prevent price gouging
to a degree yeah I'm sure
England or not England Europe in general
tends to be a little more liberal so the
government would probably have more in
place to protect the consumer just kind
of raw doggin it there but anyway let's
see here Marsh in with a1 is a gtx 1066
t good for an intel core i7 8700 k sure
it's perfectly fine what you'll find in
most games is that the 1060 will be the
bottleneck past medium to high 1440p
obviously not a 4k card i would
recommend it for most games in 4k but
it's it's a super solid 1080p card and i
would say medium 1440p card yeah it's
not bad
enemy worst case later on you could
always upgrade the graphics card right
and stick with that 8700 k for quite a
while
i'd see silver sonic used 2070 or used
1080 TI i depends on the prices I mean
look at 2070 is it's it's weaker than a
1080 TI so if you just want the most
power you can go with a 1080i granted
it's a generation all at this point but
I think that's probably your best bet
just going with a stronger card if you
want the latest tech right and you're
playing like battlefield 5 and you care
about those reflections and stuff then
2070 I would say but again I don't it
all comes down to price I don't know
Mike I don't know I don't have enough
stand to the question completely but
just off the top that's where I think
let's see contagion I see you now what
are your opinions on via text monitors
would you recommend them and if you have
an experience than before would you
please do a review on that I already
have done a review on one biotech
monitor I found vo-tech monitors are
okay there's nothing really exceptional
about them obviously I mean via tech
supplies panels to other manufacturers
as well I know they've done a couple for
MSI and and I actually used I mean the
the screen that you're seeing behind
Lisa actually it's covered by the webcam
camera that screen is a vitex screen I
use it as my daily driver because it's
an ultra-wide 1440p panel it's great for
content creation but it's it's got a
plastic housing and when it warms up the
plastic snaps and makes really loud
noises really strange obviously you have
a better bet with something like an
algae or an a Seuss you have to spend
more for it though but in general vitex
not bad although the one that I reviewed
recently had a pretty serious ghosting
problem so response time wasn't the best
on that one was advertised I think at 4
milliseconds off the top of my head it
was definitely closer to like 12 or 13
maybe even more I mean that was really
obvious ghosting maybe it was just that
panel not too sure I'll tell you another
brand that's not really a household name
is pixie oh and pixie Oh makes pretty
good panels
I've actually been impressed recently
with their releases of the px 2 7 7 I
think is what it is 2 7 7 and the 2 7 6
ow those actually a pretty solid panels
and they're cheap they're affordable as
far as I know the failure rates on those
you know out of the box issues dead
pixels and stuff aren't - aren't too bad
so go fasta asks have you ever been to
Mexico if so where and what did you
experience I've been to Mexico multiple
times I've been I've been on the west
coast Mazatlan Cabo San Lucas forget the
other place we went on that one well
yeah I'm talking about west coast of his
Mazatlan port of Puerto Vallarta I think
it was poured fer de Mazatlan and Cabo
San Lucas went on the cruise that took
us all the way down the west coast there
and then we've been on several cruises
to the east side of Mexico the Yucatan
area we've pretty much gone everywhere
on the Yucatan kitchen kneads we've been
to all kinds of like parks and places in
the Yucatan that are you know just like
for tourists like you just zip lining
and you know water slides things of that
sort that I tell you what though like we
do that a lot I got no connection on the
sly stream that's really weird we we
tend to do this things a lot like the
ziplining and stuff but I really enjoy
going into the country and like
experienced in the culture and like the
history like chitinous it was a really
cool place to visit that's the thing I
remember most about all my all the visit
to Mexico that I've been able to you
know experience I I really liked Chichen
itzá it was a really cool place
I'm just cuz that stuff's like you know
thousands of years old and you can still
like stand on some of those structures
is pretty cool
anyway let's see uh slack I've got an
Asus r-tx 20 70 Strix OC but I've heard
but have you heard about any issues
about them I've been told RT X has
problems yeah I mean there's videos
about that I think those are more
isolated than anything else I think down
to specifically reference models and
cards that use reference PCBs doesn't
seem to be too big of an issue on AIB
cards but you know that's probably a
stretch I haven't done a lot of research
into the failure rates of those cards
it's very difficult to quantify that
stuff but I have two aces cards
RTX cards here and both of them run
perfectly flat I haven't had issues with
either and they look just to be you know
consumer samples they they weren't I
mean it's like if you bought it on you
AG that's how it came in the box so
actually I think most of the time they
ship like if you if you get a review
unit from say a Zeus or gigabyte they
just send you an inventory sample from
new egg or Amazon that's how I've
noticed they do things lately
so uh what's going on Ray Brown we got a
silent member welcome silent fan okay
silent fan is the name of the member
that's interesting
Ray Brown says Mike Hawk is hiding in a
bush ha ha ha ha I get it now that's
pretty good right I am gonna scroll back
up because I feel like I missed a few
yeah let's see yeah core it chorus seat
chorus so he's right butchered that says
the hair still looks the same after 10
minutes I'm in agreement with you on
that one
hello can you see how much you lost no I
can't
it's so much there's so many hairs so
many hairs ah no it's already thinner
Ruhr player asks can you support
yourself of youtube as a career I can
I'm doing it right now I I'm not making
as much money as I could in the field if
I actually use my degrees I know that
for a fact but it's it's more enjoyable
obviously being around boss is a
privilege and a curse at the same time
you just got to learn to work with it
you know I'm young I got some energy I
can kind of feel it out play it by ear
and yeah I was able to start doing this
full-time about when the channel had
200,000 250,000 subs we were making
enough money to where I was like
comfortable like paying rent and
handling all the bills on my own that
was about the time I moved out right
after I graduated college so it was kind
of perfect timing
in a sense and that's still what I'm
doing full-time today go fasta good
question what is your current phone it
is the pixel 3 I've been using it for
about four four weeks now and it's a
really great phone I it's been getting
some hate across social media and stuff
but I haven't had issues at all at my
pixel 3 and I really like the camera so
my review is coming soon I'm not one to
just like get the phone use it for a day
and then review it like in a proper
review so that's why I've been using it
as my daily for close to a month now and
I'm gonna start scripting the video here
soon so that you guys can get DL as to
whether or not the pixel 3 is worth your
700 or so dollars
it's pretty expensive and that's gonna
be one of my biggest negatives about
this fellas like phones in general or
getting pricey and it's annoying
let's see Magic's alharbi do you think
the motherboard is e3 98 prime is good
is a good processor I 9k I'm kind of
confused by that if you're asking about
the motherboard I like Asus boards in
general I'd have to look more
specifically to that board I think I've
had something similar to the z3 90 a
just a couple chipsets down the prime
boards have been pretty good in my
experience I've had two or three of them
and nothing's failed on me power
delivery seems to be okay and I think
it's too crispy too toasty on those so
I'm just you know kind of a quick little
summary there of my experience with them
at least let's see cookie asks do you
have any good recommendations for gaming
headphones been looking at the asus rog
strict fusion 300
had set right now i've been using the HS
70 from course they're pretty good
gaming headset a decent battery life i
did a review on that you can check it
out i compared it against the corsair
void pros which you might also consider
I also like Sennheiser I have to check
the freaking yeah I got that I did a
couple of pre-rolls for the set for that
sennheiser headset I never did a review
on it I I didn't want to do a review and
then promote it like in the same week
because that would have felt a little
disingenuous but I really liked the
headset so that's why I took on the the
pre-rolls with mass drop and you know
100% comfortable putting my name behind
that that brand that is especially that
particular model so I will find that
headset I'll try to link it if I can
remember after this is all said and done
also yeah I've really only had
experience with Coolermaster Corsair
razor to an extent used to have turtle
beaches and and then son Heiser and I I
think of all of them my favorites have
been the Corsair headset the HS 70 and
that Sennheiser headset great mic
quality on it Sennheiser but the course
there's feel a little more gamey so it
just depends ostracize child $20 super
check
my dude happy Sunday / Monday for
everyone I forgot to say that earlier so
thank you for bringing that up yeah
happy Sunday / Monday depending on where
you live on planet Earth
as you can see I'm getting a haircut and
progress is well it's taken a while I do
it slow it's my first time she's doing
it slow I don't want to cut holes in it
why is this stream buffering is that me
am I just not pushing his uh I got zero
dropped frames I don't know
it's YouTube's uh YouTube's servers hey
yeah yeah so we got fiber over here okay
I'm going to scroll down here take
superglue some opinion is it too poufy
and for your here well then you gotta
cut it you gotta cut more no I am yeah
oh she has a cut it yeah Oh see that's
why I was shaking yeah yeah JC she's
gonna use the razor of it later don't
worry I'm she's she's trying I should
have done it from the video I told her
that she doesn't know what she's doing I
mean literally she doesn't know what
she's doing she's never done this before
so she's learning but she wants to pick
up a little bit of experience with the
scissors you know she wants to go manual
with it I don't mind that yeah maybe
next time we get an actual hair scissor
those aren't hair cut scissors seriously
like you see this little thing Walmart
see that little prong sticking out there
look they're the same the blade quality
might be slightly worse but like the the
scissors themselves are you know the way
they're designed their haircut scissors
you know I asked once a hairdresser how
much a real scissored cost them dear
like up to three thousand yeah that's
that's retarded nobody'll ever pay that
much money for scissors unless you have
just money packed into the walls of your
home as CPF noob I'm a noob with PC
installing installing and Best Buy
charge me eighty dollars to install a
CPU cooler and a case fan do you think
that's a fair price or highway robbery
definitely the latter I would never pay
that much for anybody to do anything
that simple especially when you realize
you know how easy it is to do but I can
see right people were a little scared do
stuff like that hands-on labor if
they've never done anything like this
before with pcs then maybe they can
charge that I mean I might be fair
market price I don't know I just know
that in my opinion it would be worth
learning how to do this firsthand to
save myself the 80 bucks because those
people over there don't deserve
for that little amount of work that
they're doing that's my take probably a
little ya dare $2 stupid shet thought
you were shaving at all no I would only
shave my head bald if someone threw like
a thousand bucks at I mean there's only
time does everyone have Ely Greg you got
your MBA yet uh yeah great well I
haven't graduated I graduate this coming
Friday but I finished the whole program
in late October so it's officially
finished I mean technically I have it I
just haven't gotten the diploma in hand
so excited for that let's see mr. mink
says I'm telling you that old man style
bald top haircut is where it's at and
yeah yeah I've been dating him no no no
no low graphics TV hey Greg is an Intel
i5 8400 and RX 584 Giga good combo
yeah that's a really good combo actually
it's a really balanced system there it's
good for you know a bill that's he could
probably build something with those
specs for under a thousand bucks
actually and I know you can so that's a
good price point and then also you're
asking for what PS you do you recommend
it really depends I would go with any
EVGA unit see sonic unit somewhere in
that realm if you're going for a budget
build I wouldn't recommend like be quiet
or or maybe like the higher-end course
their power supplies those tend to be a
little more expensive but they you know
you get acquired a PSU overall typically
more efficient efficient but you could
get like a 80 plus bronze 500 watt EVGA
unit for like 40 bucks I would go
something like that and they're pretty
quiet - I've used them personally let's
see scrolling down is it look bad a
cotton cutting candidates ooh we have a
new member a new channel member
ostracize child what is going on I hope
you feel super snazzy with that star
next to your name now it's about all I
can really give you apart from a shout
out on a live stream and I always look
for you guys in the in the chat so if I
see one of you I try to give you a shout
out
I see silent fan as well
fan just became a member greg Randleman
here watching SteelSeries rival 600 a
logitech g502 do you have experience
with logitech did you follow to you use
that way though don't you zoe whatever i
used to use the logitech wind pass but
it's really long time ago but ever good
- mm-hmm
what about steel series I think about
steel series mm-hmm
whilst as serious like has more as
simple as I like Zoe's so they're good
they're really good - but it depends of
your needs if you need like a Moz with a
lot of buttons and stuff in series it's
not your choice hmm hey yeah first hand
experienced there she used to play csgo
professionally so she's she's got her
her favorite peripherals picked out she
uses Ellie for everything but yeah she's
got experience with the other things -
yeah I just use like I don't care like I
use like some cheaper cooler master mice
I used to use a g.skill now it's like if
nothing super hardcore I'm not that not
that choosy I guess let's see yeah
starfish you want to start fish I see
that beautiful yellow star next to your
name you're looking good I appreciate
that membership hahaha Jakob says did
she say Lord GTX bogey tech go get a log
e tingling Logitech legit like logic I
love Jeff I can see why you'd say login
tech that I mean like because the G is
not like a it's usually a soft G but it
sounds like a J and the word yeah so I
get I get it it's okay I'll let that one
slide Justin Justin says please do a
guitar video I want to hear you hear you
blast your ears with that Marshall stack
you have I did that at one point there's
a there's a video on the channel where
I'd they're setting I played like the
intro for a scorpion song wasn't like
going hardcore or anything but that's
really gross you should but yeah you can
watch that video I'll do a few more
things here in the future I people were
just people like really weird when I do
stuff that's not like conventional you
know most of the time it's PC stuff when
I do a guitar thing it's like oh what
channel is this unsubscribe so I've been
trying to play it safe lately
screw it I think I think I'll just I'll
do it maybe for like the intro video or
something like five seconds you know so
it's not quick enough
alright so it's not long enough for them
to formulate an opinion about whether or
not they enjoy it existing in the video
or not let's see one cavi per does your
H s 70 work with a sound card
it was Bluetooth so it plugs directly
into a Bluetooth port the the bluetooth
dongle side of it so I don't I mean it
could I don't know you could probably it
would work with your sound card software
but like you unless your sound card has
like a USB port it's not gonna work
directly with that not not at least out
of the box I'm pretty sure I don't use
sound cards so I wouldn't really know
but then again people who use sound
cards when most parts swear by them
right because they're used to it and you
go go to the on board stuff and it's
like oh it's censor staticky it sounds
so bad I feel like you're you're uh
you're talking to me yeah everything
going on back there
yeah okay okay you should pray I think
Jonathan Johnson ping focus your camera
the cameras focused but you probably
need a bump your resolution I locked
focus so I know it's not me well I say
that could be something on camera but
pretty sure marca Greg can you make
guitar tutorials love to learn from you
I'll be pretty cool you like guitar like
a guitar channel call it sound studio
you know we could call a sound studio oh
yeah you could be in the video too you
could be yeah you could be like the the
guests right who is learning like the
basics and and so my struggles yeah so
the viewer could relate to you that way
they'd feel better about like not being
able to nail like the D chord or
whatever
yeah you think I'm not the only one now
that's pretty good you need a long time
and patient see ya Joe crispy gaming
being honest how hard is it to swap out
a motherboard well it sucks if the
cooler huge you got to take off the yeah
take off the cooler and you gotta take
out the CPU you got to unplug everything
I mean it's probably the most annoying
thing to replace in a computer because
it's under everything else Cody so
Lockwood you ever think about expanding
your team for science studio oh yeah it
depends
we'd have to be making enough money to
do that and right now we are not so it's
right you got me for free yeah so
eventually I want Lisa to be an integral
role but right now it's pretty much just
me doing all the filming editing and
scripting and whatnot kind of just I
retreat to my office and I try to pump
out as many quality videos as I can in a
week and that's been diminished down to
about two or three a week now plus a
live stream that's about all I can
handle is one person I you know if I
upload it every day like it would just
be trash videos so I don't think you
guys deserve that I don't the view
counts to drop as a result of a decline
in quality so I have I've told myself
that you know if I can't get a video
finished in time and the only way to
upload it when I want to upload it is to
you know compromise some aspect of the
experiment or testing the product
I just won't upload it and I'll eat the
the loss in revenue just because I don't
you guys expect from a channel like this
a channel that has the word science and
its name like that's that's something I
don't take lightly and I want to make
sure I approach the way that I test
products with that in mind I want to use
the scientific method and basically
every everything I do on this channel
unless we you know or reading craigslist
ads or something that's just a way for
us to you know ease the seatback a
little bit not be so serious here and
the live streams are also a good way to
to vent as well so you guys get to see
hopefully a different side of me I'm
trying to be more serious in most of the
videos but here it's just it's just
relaxation and the occasional difficult
question that makes me sound really
stupid on air so let's see here buzzing
we can see we can see that ring on your
finger Lisa he did not get you for free
by the way bazinga I know you saw I'm
pretty sure you saw my comment earlier
but yeah we will be doing the part of
the face she baked it herself I'm just
kidding we totally bought it from
Walmart but it's a cherry pie we bought
it knowing that you pledged 100 bucks
I was gonna get part of the face so
worth it I the way I see here look the
pie costs 4 bucks a hundred bucks that's
a $96 $96 net profit right so I'm all
about that all about that uh
that net so I think it's worth it
I hope is think I hope you feel like you
getting your money's worth I hope I hope
you do I think you will but I'm not
gonna be a baby you know my face unless
you like throw it hardcore like a
baseball it shouldn't happen
there's electronics worth more than some
cars in this you don't want to like miss
and throw on something in trash a
computer please know it's on your face
honey I'm sorry I'm sorry it's kind of
go in your face
sorry someone says the main cameras all
focus is it don't look at the camera
real quick see it's all focus I'm pretty
sure it's just the bitrate like we're
streaming at 25000 kilobits per second
but is it on visiting focus yeah yeah
it's just a bit rate you guys and if
you're streaming at anything other than
1080p or 720p please don't tell me that
it's out of focus because it's really
not it's just your resolution is
probably not up to par and the bit rate
is also trashing the video so yeah it's
fine I think I think it's okay that's
because I got the apertures narrower I
think the only people complaining are
the ones who are watching this in a
lower resolution let's see here
pcs lack PI PC slang 5 when you turn
your head the camera loses focus for a
moment is it out of focus is it it
should be on manual focus yes
go check then that might be what they're
talking about it's a AFC or AFS or MF
mm oh yeah it's manual so it's not me
and are they talking about this camera
I'm sorry I made sure that the focus on
this camera was uh you can't go an arrow
let's see yeah it ain't it's not it's
not this camera it's not the webcam no I
I mean I made sure it was in focus when
I started the livestream yeah people are
saying the camera is fine for them gyro
hey says it's a bit blurry and I have
300 megabits per second down again
that's the that's the compression of
YouTube live we're not streaming a 4k so
the bitrate is gonna be on YouTube side
probably close to 10 megabits per second
we're streaming it at 250 megabits per
second so wait yeah 200 no it's 20 to 25
yeah 25 megabits per second excuse me so
there's this probably closer to 10 and
that's where you're gonna you're gonna
start to see 1080p taper off but it's I
guarantee it's not the camera we just we
just verified that so it's probably
YouTube's doing it rattling the
bandwidth I do have it on variable
bitrate though so I wonder if that's
what it is because if I lock it at 1080p
then it drops everything to 10 so I was
like okay well let's do variable bitrate
thinking that would be better I'm not
sure if that's actually better or not so
we'll see
it's we're getting mixed feedback some
are like it's not good somewhere like
it's fine
it's abash this is 6 megabits per second
yeah even worse than 10 is 6 and 6 is
like borderline for 1080p it's not gonna
look crispy put it that way it's not
gonna look as crispy as if I uploaded it
as a regular video on YouTube let's see
so people are saying the webcam looks
better that's weird
oh yeah it looks a little bit blurry
when I look at it yeah I'm this fella
move move move so I can see me see that
that's that's what the issue is they're
saying that this part of it is Alex Alex
pieces are missing I'll get to it Alex
we're trying to fix this camera thing
Wow Kyle that's surfer Kyle McCoy uh
yeah I don't know why it's it's 1080p 60
that's really weird
let me see capture card video format
match fps custom yeah it looks fine to
us on this no that's fine
they just started complaining about it
but the camera has been locked so the
manual focus has been there the whole
time
yeah see so other people are saying it's
fine all right we're not gonna mess with
that anymore
yes Janek Garcias is where y'all 240p
guys that uh yeah I'm sorry guys it's
just YouTube it's just how it is I know
you guys want to see the fine details in
the hair you want to see those beautiful
locks but uh I can I'll give you all
some close-up action here soon yeah yeah
they're just saying the webcams a little
more clear which is funny cuz it's like
a c920 like it's crab
nobody streaming cam then we'll see 920
is not yours to the c920 in there it's
the same it's the same sensor yeah has a
different software it's it's Logitech
software in it yeah but the other eight
software is different hmm Brady says
noticed me something I haven't noticed
you sorry I would turn my head toward
the camera but I don't want to like rip
hair out of my head when she's grabbing
it ooh
hi I'm ish says people are bothered
because DXR is a non hahahaha that's
good
go fasta
he says you should make a video on the
coarser six 450 best $20 psu but it is
very underrated what is the one that we
just used we just used to see X 550 I
think Co fossa we just use a power
supply very similar that from cooler
from Corsair so uh yeah and I talked
about it a little bit my experience with
it actually quite quiet for the price
but but uh let's see yeah and I know
we're not dropping any frames like I can
see that on well at least on stream lab
side we're not dropping any frames I've
got the 2700 X in the streaming system
by the way for those wondering we were
using the I 989 or I nine p99 79ad IC
which is definitely overkill for pretty
much anything we bumped the bitrate at
one point up to like 50,000 kilobits per
second 50 megabits per second and it's
still it was like 5% CPU usage is really
this is really not breaking a sweat so I
switched to the Rison 2700 X just to I
feel like that's definitely more of a
consumer grade CPU just from a price
perspective and it's something that
probably a lot of you are using for
streaming so that that are like a risin
2600 or I 5 RI 7 so I can relate more
using the CPU and then I can see exactly
what kind of resources we're using you
know and to what extent we're using them
let's see victress glad to see you again
pictures hope you are doing well my
friend he says nice haircut well
hopefully uh hopefully it looks nice at
the end of it I think ah someone says
hair works I get it that's funny that's
really funny you got it yet yet been
here works hair works do you know what's
on your hair well yeah but do you know
the other meaning of that no video hair
works never played witcher 3 oh that was
like the game or hair work hair works
was like pushed hard and i mean it's in
a lot of games but i just know what your
three with hair works is that's a big
deal and it's very resource intensive
but anyway that's really funny is Pepsi
here is she on the ground
she was here earlier in the livestream
so if you missed her you can scroll back
I think it'll be posted the whole live
stream will be archived no fee
but uh yeah baby it's 9:46 how we doing
I'm 46 already I just have 15 minutes
left you are not getting a tip I'm not
getting a tip I do this for free what
you're talking with the chance if she's
gonna get mad at me when once you look
in your yeah really van says this is a
long haircut
amen to that my dude what products would
you recommend to improve volume and
shine babe what do you use for volume
and shine for volume and shine volume
and shine um you should use coconut oil
for hair treatment like once a week or
every two weeks you can do that you put
just coconut oil in your hair is let it
sit for a little bit and then you wash
it out that makes them shiny and it's
healthy for the hairs mm-hmm okay well
you heard it there first I don't use any
hair products except for shampoo it's
really about it on my shampoo yeah I've
been using it because I had round all my
son's always empty your cells like
purple and thick it's really weird you
just a purple one yeah that's to make
the blonde you're blonder yeah yeah I'll
see that you'll see those blonde streaks
in there yeah this is to bleach them a
little bit oh oh it's gonna go Australia
and then makes them really dried it's
not good for your hair yeah mythical
good question are you still able to go
back to 60fps after experiencing 144 I
feel like it is super choppy after using
124 good question and yeah I mean your
experience is definitely it's definitely
echoed by many others out there 60fps is
okay until you move up to something much
better than that and I think it really
does to depend on the game if you are
playing like a fast-paced first-person
shooter 1:44 is gonna look beautiful if
you you know if you're pushing 144
frames and you have a panel that
supports that framerate but 20 is a must
yeah you're admit your panels are 240
and so you're actually
240 I mean your system is pushing a 4 in
csgo yeah yeah huge difference right so
an especially was fast paced games I
don't feel like it matters as much in
like racing games and stuff and so again
it just depends on the title obviously
you're playing like CS not csgo like
cities skylines probably not gonna care
if it's 60 FPS or 120 although I don't
know picturing city skylines running at
120 FPS Wow it would be nice if we could
get a system that can do that even even
my personal rig doesn't handle 60 FPS
most of the time especially with the
mods I have on it so yeah let's see a
lot of people have I missed a couple
super chats most give me one from you
you always look the same I don't know
you know like oh yeah you didn't cut any
of that yeah I did but there's still a
lot I've scrolled so far oh here we go
bazinga mister $5 $5 super chef from
bazinga
well you please review the lat latte
panda it's a Windows 10 single board
computer and it's only $100 what the
heck I know it really does I feel like
he's trolling us yeah let the coffee is
it the Starbucks one that sounds super
sketch yeah I'm not too sure now oh yeah
this is something else
oh gosh are you good
do you want to have them all over here
opening I mean I don't want to open here
No oh there's a good question from Kyle
McCoy how big a difference is it between
single channel and dual channel Ram well
from a Bama I mean dual channel man dual
channel memory from a bandwidth
perspective is literally double the Ben
it doubles the bandwidth the access to
those chips are between the chips and
the CPU so it's technically a lot faster
but the extent to which software is
dependent on single versus dual channel
memory configurations is totally
dependent on again the developer a lot
of games I spend a long time since that
tested single channel memory did you
mess it up wait what did you do
no yeah I don't know maybe looks good
what did you do cutting your ears
nothing else your as well jason says the
more hair she cuts the more FPS I get
must have that hair works run-ins are
you I'm getting nervous now she's
cutting right up my ear yeah yeah go
faster good question do you think 892 P
is a little too this is too little for
the iPhone XR I know I think that was
something that people blew out of
proportion it was did you miss it it's
good ok you should use two hands that
was not okay that's good okay I can be a
heretic question oh yeah confessor uh
yeah I think people blew that waiter
proportion I think that was a reason for
people to just still like hate on Apple
and hate on their like business
practices and call them anti-consumer
and blah blah blah but the iPhone XR
does not look bad in person
the screen is slightly noticeably less
sharp than the iPhone 10x or will the I
attend X then the iPhone 10 regular 10
but it's nothing to freak out about I
really don't think it's that big a deal
hmm Oh bazinga says it's a real thing
like a Raspberry Pi but has Windows 10
oh and they call it the Lotte panda or
whatever what do you say was Lotte
something that did Penn don't yeah yeah
what in the world
uh-huh pseudo soul says ear cut we want
blood no it would definitely be grounds
for do monetization on like YouTube when
they would totally de monetize this
video if like you cut my ear and like I
acted like a creative child I'm just
wondering how it's going you don't even
touch the front my hair have you oh do
you need to get there I guess okay well
you're I can just turn can we make you
like a little cutie no can we make him a
little acuity no we can get we making
Malou okay can you okay um can I spray
in your face numb
Pepsi I know what this feels like now I
am path I huh where is she you she's in
here with us when we're both on the same
room yeah but I think she goes scared
from the water spring thingy
oh uh zero says all nos phones can die
yeah I I really don't like notches I
don't even like it on her on her XR
that's why I like the pixel three I
think more than the pixel three XL
because the exhales bigger yeah it's a
bigger screen more real estate but the
pixel three is like there's no knotch
and I love that so just yeah I don't
know it's it's something I'm probably
never gonna get used to and yeah that's
just my take on that I know the
microphones over there so I apologize
all just gonna sound a little out of
whack for a few while she's uh trimming
the top mythical Phoenix says reverse
mohawk anyone Oh everybody in the chit
uh Ben B says I feel your pain Salazar
this must be super annoying to deal with
you're being a trooper I'm trying my
friends I'm trying I'm trying to keep my
cool I don't want to lose my cool in
front of everybody you minded me to cut
your hairs well it was enough it was an
eye
that I think someone had brought up on a
live stream last week so great miss
bazinga still here
silent fan says you should have a
before-and-after snapshot at the end of
the video well we have the before
snapshot that's the thumbnail it's also
on Twitter speaking of Twitter soon as
they look at the hack job
all right I'm scrolling over to Twitter
because know it's really hard to pepper
the ears all right we got some view
questions over here Karl Morin Carlin
calls a good guy goals for 2019 one of
my goals would be to obviously I want to
go the channel more I think another goal
of - to branch out and create other
channels that don't detract from the
content you see here I I kind of started
doing that with satire studio although
I've only upload one video I realize how
difficult it is to manage two or three
different channels at the same time but
that's my goal and eventually I want to
hire other people to take on those roles
on those channels respectively but keep
the studio name at the end of it right
so we have science to do we have satire
studio and then hopefully I don't know
the guitar idea was really cool actually
so maybe like a sound studio or
something which would be all about music
and I'm all about that music played
guitar my whole life basically so yeah
that's one of the big goals at least
pertain to YouTube that I have planned
Victor worst nightmare my worst
nightmare would be I remember one time I
was being attacked by a lion and this
lion has some sharp claws and somehow I
was able to outrun him
to an extent I know it was a I know it
was a male tiger because it had like pee
in the mane
he scratched me he lunged at anyone who
scratched me all across my chest my in
my stomach and it felt like the feeling
was super vivid like yeah I've never
been stabbed in my life but I could
imagine it feels something like the way
I felt in that dream and I thought you
could only dream about stuff you've
experienced you know or feel things
you've experienced but this felt super
real so I don't know maybe I was stabbed
in a former life and it's like coming
back to haunt me
but yeah that's one of the
the nightmares I still remember because
it was just so painful I never felt that
much pain and a dream before T's let's
see Raisa three twelve hundred and ten
fifty T I look into upgrade and step
into 1440p capable Hardware suggestions
okay so 1440p you're starting off the
resolution I think your first step is to
upgrade to graphics card eventually you
want to see an upgrade to the platform
or not necessarily platform but the the
CPU rising three twelve hundred not
really going to cut it so I would say
you know bumping that to like a rise in
five 2606 cord be ideal but even if you
want to go like rising five fourteen
hundred I think that'll be still a
pretty noteworthy upgrade and then the
1050 Ti 1440p - possibly a 1070 if you
can find a use 1075 around 220 $240 u.s.
at least that would be a pretty sweet
deal yeah see stitch II what's your
recommended a IO from performance I've
had really good experience performance
wise with Corsair iOS from an aesthetic
standpoint I really like deep cool a iOS
I think they look the best you can
orient the CPU blocks really whichever
direction you want which is a pet peeve
of mine with other manufacturers and
they're also super quiet again just not
as powerful the pumps are pretty weak in
those by comparison you know heat
dissipation is just not as ideal but
yeah so I would say Best Performance in
my experience it's been with Corsair
best-looking overall you know decent a
i/o for the price has been deep Coolio's
it's just something I've always liked
captain a iOS from deep cool and just I
don't know always stuck with me
rural is youtuber main job can you
support yourself with it yes it's my
main job answered this early the live
stream you want scroll back and get more
details into that but yeah it's my main
job it's been my main job since about
250 200 and 250 case ups and yeah you
know living comfortable off like news
there's no reason to really go back into
the field just because you know it's
it's an opportunity to get to be my own
boss to kind of build something from the
ground up and it's fun it's exciting so
you know let's see Josh hi well the gtx
1066 efe and an intel 87 okay this could
be a quick combo us and the live stream
I saw that in and I
answered that one let's see Michael
important question how is life treating
you
life is treating me quite well right now
I got everything complain about you know
my parents are still what's up sorry
nothing my parents are living in a house
it's completely gutted right now so
their lives aren't doing too great they
stay with me for a while but our place
is just really small and everyone was
feeling cramped I asked them to stay but
I know that they just it's just really
tiny here I only got this and thinking
that Lisa and I would be here so it's uh
it's been it's been a time anyway but me
personally I'm doing alright I am
blessed and I have Lisa here now which
is a really really big plus to keep
talking to her on a frickin camera
halfway across the world and yeah like
they do now other cameras gonna cut and
come back with Greg wearing Lisa's
beanie yeah I gotta cover this sucker up
how's it look okay
my neck is itchy right now like super
itchy oh all that hair yeah alright I
was Sina she's gonna see now folks do
you think there's this tool on still
that's alright let me see oh sure it was
even back there yeah it's so pretty I
think I made I have a baby like you
missed like stuff like this yes yeah
yeah because I wanted to check here okay
we're good okay I guess alright so take
care that said then yeah alright I think
I already won for what you afford afford
it cherry pie no you're not done yet you
still gotta shave but no I'm just asking
because I'm almost done and preferably
on the sides to have you haven't yet
alright alright I'm worried
demon asks how long lisa is staying so
we're still you know we're still in the
waiting game for her green card but she
has a tourist visa right now so she can
stay for up to six months so she'll be
here till like April and then hopefully
by then she'll have her interview or
around that time for her green card and
and then you feel good and then she can
stay here for good for good yeah if I
don't mess up the interview
how would you mess up the interview I
don't know like break down start crying
like freaking out too much stress you
wouldn't do that don't know oh gosh if
you say something yeah I just married
him because of the green card and you
don't get it yeah then you won't get it
but we have let's see a question here
from me to pin I wanna I was reading it
what you're thinking 1080i prices are
going to keep going up yeah they're
gonna because 1080i is they're going
down in inventory that mean inventory is
depleting cuz they're older cards now so
when production stops supply dries up
prices go up that's econ 101 my friend I
know you know that I'm just for those
who are wondering what we're talking
about that is just a result of new cards
being released and yeah so if you buy
new those prices are gonna keep going up
baby you gotta cut quicker than that
you're cutting too slow and you're
everything hair out of my head like it
hurts a lot
okay yeah but it's the first time how
long did you take for building your
first PC you probably double the time
that you need now right I'm just saying
I usually cut my own hair and yeah I'd
be done I already be out of the shower
all just cleaned up yeah and I see how
it always looks like in the back I'm
giving her crap all right well do you
want the back looks good I can do the
trash cuz I have a mirror are you in to
get the razor enough oh she's getting
that blade oh by the way there are
different like size Clips if you want to
add those but I just have the bear blade
because I figured you were just gonna do
trimming around the neck and stuff yeah
yeah oh yeah like rip this we put like
trash bags on the floor so the hair
wouldn't go everywhere
yeah we'll see hey hard-luck says Greg's
a baby I am NOT you have no idea how
painful this is she's she's like
grabbing the hair and then she's just
pulling it without it actually being cut
you know you know you guys know I'm
talking about heads give me crap they
know what they're talking eight upin
says here's two dollars for the pain
hashtag worth it don't rip anymore
though please please
I can't hurt you right now you can all
right yeah go ahead go ahead
you just you just push it into it and
then pull down don't pull it don't go up
with it because if you go up and you
slip you're gonna chop all my hair off
so make sure you stab in and go down all
right like this yeah you could turn it
over and do it the other way to do it
either way but yeah yeah that's how I do
it anyway that's conventional or not
it's if any it'll work because I can
that right
this is feeling super sketch Fox's death
awaits yeah
okay I see a super chat here from Jordan
I'm assuming you can hear me Jordan
probably probably yeah you mean one sec
thirty forty by 1441 20 Hertz or 1440p
144 either ones fine if you like the
ultra wide form factor go with that the
difference between 120 and 144 is a lot
smaller visually than the difference
between say 120 and 60 so depends on the
price I would just get the cheaper of
the two unless you really want a ultra
wide in which case 34 40 it's definitely
good why didn't I do your hairs with I
told you that Mauricio would have been
darn right yeah we did old-fashioned
Alex asked what did you get Lisa for the
holidays I telling you she's right she's
right here it's a secret you already got
me my holy day stuff we should talk go
fasta what's your favorite hardware
channel good question i really like kyle
bit wit that what's really fun
entertaining to watch like watching jay
for like the water cooling stuff paul's
really good informative type channel
these are good he's a good transition
from from Kyle even though Kyle you
still learn a lot from it's it's a
they're they're a good combo and then
some smaller channels I'll top my head I
really like a little dim optimum text
really good just really great like
production value in those channels so
hopefully they continue to grow
cuz their stuff looks really good on on
screen our London three two dollars and
forty seven cents I don't know what the
heck kind of number that is but I
appreciate the super chat let's see here
captain says you can pick up a use ten
fifty for 75 bucks pretty good yeah Lisa
you get a line up the sides I do
oh yeah gamers Nexus a holy forever GN
yeah Steve obviously for the like
hardcore informative in-depth stuff his
kind of content is what I originally
started the channel thinking I would be
doing but I've just if I did the kind of
stuff they did just with one person just
just with me I would have no life at all
they they have a really good team over
there and they do a lot of really good
work yeah
I can't believe forget GM but yeah
gamers Nexus is really good Steve's a
good guy and he's helped me out quite a
bit I've had a few questions coming
across just like you know builds and
stuff bios settings all kinds of weird
fan issues and whatnot and that he's
helped me troubleshoot them and it's
been really helpful
yeah kWe dog says a little dim is
underrated he really is a little dim is
really a really good channel I really
like that guy that was why I brought him
up because like he's one of the ones I
remember just a smaller Channel very
modest size but he deserves a lot more
in my opinion especially for that
production value so yeah that was that
was why I brought him up let's see how
are we doing back there bitch alright
that's so much fun I want to keep doing
there's so much here I can doing oh gosh
a man sir expectation for CES we're
still working on getting the funds to go
trying to secure a few more sponsorships
we plan to go I think we're still gonna
go with the budget that we have it's
gonna be really tight but also live like
in a small Shack or while we're in Vegas
right babe you're cool with that it's a
cool I can't even attend I don't care
see see you guys find yourself a girl
who has no problem sleeping in a tent
with you when times are tough I tell you
now she's the one she's willing to do
that with you I say she's keeper see
zero chance Bobby like super check my
dude someone asked about your channel
name considering most your contents
computer stuff and I'm curious also so I
started the channel a long time ago with
the intent of doing like science in
general like astronomy physics geology
all that stuff and I did my earliest
videos are about that but my audience is
really built on on PCs the PC builds
that I had on the channel those videos
blew up and so I just started centering
my content on tech it's still science so
there's nothing you know inaccurate
about the channel name but it's
definitely more focus than I thought it
would be and that's fine I enjoy this
stuff it's really fun good question
though
oh that's a I felt like you went really
deep on that one no okay better she's
like no but she knows she did
Oh looking cute James top top top B
Bobby J sorry if I butchered that James
link that Tendo I've super chapped my
dude says hey man can you do a quick
rundown of your guitar equipment good
question I always love talking about
guitars so um let's start with the
guitars themselves we have two gifts and
Les Paul customs one of them is a cherry
red another one is a black like the
cherry red is like probably my favorite
guitar that I own it just like it plays
so beautifully the humbucker sound
beautiful I have an ESB she actually she
bought me the ESP it's the same one that
Ben from Breaking Benjamin plays yep
yeah
I always forget a name of the resin it's
an LT Dec thousand she knows her stuff
that's what's up yeah I was never really
into ESP until she bought me that and I
realized that he plays that guitar like
that model guitar pretty much every life
i body where he does well I like that
Susan so here's here's what she saw it
we both saw it at the Hard Rock Hotel in
Vegas last year at CES and she
remembered the guitar and she went and
bought the good I mean this is like an
expensive guitar and she spent her own
money on at the time for me and it was
my wedding prism for you yeah you feel
guilty because yeah it was a lot of
money for an engagement ring
we don't do this in Europe well that was
like no way I mean it's not not to say
it's expected but like I don't even I
don't know where it's and worms so we're
scared I'm uh I'm glad I got it for you
I
looks really pretty on you but I love
that guitar that ESP is sitting right
now on the guitar stand cause it's the
one I'm currently pointing at bring in
ones yeah is it it's plugged in right
now isn't it just finished this week
I'll do a video where I actually show
them what we have I have a Marshall cat
stack TSL 100 so I want to say that's
the brain and a full stack that's a
that's a beach that's what someone's
talking about really in the live stream
they're seeing that in a few older
videos it's not here with me in the
apartment cause it's just too big and
there's no space for it here but let me
get our house hopefully next year we
will be moving that in obviously we have
I just bought a box beautiful amp tube
amp as well tube amps are selling so
crisp it's 100 watt 15 watt effective 10
inch and it's it's beast I have a boss
pedal board we have overdrive distortion
equalizer flanger and then we have
digital delay GJ yeah the digital delays
going on and she's looking at the hair
now and then other other guitars I
missed we have a couple Fender strats
one of them's American Fender Strat
sounds really good really twangy it's
just a different vibe overall and then a
couple baby Taylor's acoustics but and
then we have a Gibson SG yeah
and the SG is a another one of those
it's more like a that to me it's like a
showpiece like it's not the best guitar
to play on but obviously I mean
and it's young no gotta get that SG it's
just like that's that's one of those if
you're gonna collect art you've got to
have an f3 and it's the same color since
- it's beautiful yeah maybe maybe it
soon I'll upload a video just kind of
give me a tour of those and they'd be
playing around with some of them just
talking about the sounds and whatnot
maybe might do that on a different
channel but stay tuned let's see here

bands and my dad listened to a lot

no choice but I'm glad I was exposed to
it because there they are they're a
great band and they've inspired a lot of
newer more modern bands as well I'd love
to see them a concert I've seen Breaking
Benjamin a few others I listen to you on
a daily basis in concert but I have
never seen Metallica that would be a
killer concert okay let's

everything okay
Jonathan bhindi response time an IPS
panel different than a TN is super
noticeable for twitch twitch shooters
depends on the panel some IPS panels
have really bad response time teens
generally have a better response time
but if you can find a good panel with
good reviews that mention a low response
time you usually won't have an issue
with it I'll fix you interested in
software programming I am I've been
trying to learn a little bit of it I've
been just you know html5 in CSV or kind
of ones where I've been starting but I
tried at one point I learn C++ and that
was that was a disaster so maybe I'll
try to get back into it at some point
right now I'm more focused on languages
real languages trying to learn German
because her whole family speaks German
and not English so it would be nice to
be able to actually communicate with
them and you know now that I'm finished
with school it I have more more time
right to work with on my plate so she'll
be able to teach me a lot that'll be fun

missiny okay that's your contagion on
Twitter asks to ask Lisa her opinions on
csgo
going free and having a battle royale
game-mode you were telling me about this
little oh yeah there was a new update
and now I was see school is free to play
so everyone that one took ever to try
but never want to just spend money and
is not booked there's like people suck
now cuz they either didn't totally know
I actually not the problem is now like
everyone is complaining about having
more cheaters before it was like a
system you had to purchase like premium
and then you could play like just with
premium members and every time a cheetah
was banned you had to purchase a new one
but now yeah it's not anymore and so
everyone is complaining about it I
started playing it a little bit but I
have met any cheaters yet so I have to
try a little bit longer to actually get
an opinion about it uh see Alex good
question on Twitter why do you think ram
speeds are still measured in megahertz
while they are well into the gigahertz
range is she really good question I
think it's all marketing hype I think
they're literally just trying to sell
you on the speed alright and it sounds a
lot faster to say forty two hundred
megahertz versus 4.2 gigahertz I think I
think you're literally just comes down
to marketing and remember it's double
data rate right so the effective speed
is half of that
that's they pepsi what do you think they
looking good kisses she ain't giving me
no kisses right now she said she's upset
at me oh all right I think bazinga is in
the chat I hope he is is uh we're doing
this for you bazinga we're doing this
for you keep looking at the main camera
but I forget we have like a camera there
so uh yeah this is super irritating this
is gonna suck it's gonna be like I'm so
sorry we we couldn't find blueberries so
I picked cherry because cherries
anywhere better it's like so much hair
I think Selena don't want to throw it I
want to eat it because it looks really
good but if I take it out it's like
super messy it's already breaking
something yeah yeah yeah don't let it
fall

noticed yeah so we promised bazinga he
said he said he'd super chair that's a
hundred bucks if if I got a pie the face
had to be cherry or blueberry and I'm
super cheap and money's cool so I said
yeah I said we'll do it for $100 super
chat so that's why I'm seeing if he's in
here whatever we're gonna do it anyway
we've already built the suspense so
people people came to the pie or at
least now they're gonna stay for the pie
yeah I mean it's all worth it because
yeah it's gonna be mad after the fact so
