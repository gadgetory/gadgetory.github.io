rigs in the channel recently so we'd
prepared a budget PC build for you guys
and pack this video with tips and tricks
when it comes to building a solid 1080p
gaming rig for under 500 USD
in light of spending lightly this video
is brought to you by arrow pools new a
cylon mini clocking in at around 35
bucks it's the first area you can save
money when building on a tight budget
you'll get the addressable RGB
integration which is pretty sweet for
this price category and the micro ATX
form factor pairs nicely with cheaper m
ATX motherboards click the link below
for more details so let's start things
off with our own budget billet for late
2018 and we'll mix in some buying tips
along the way there are certainly
compromises involved every budget build
will have at least one but I don't think
you'll be too disappointed with this one
for the price we spent about 450 bucks
on it what you're looking at here is
arisin 3 1300 X paired with the stock
cooler and the cheapest a m4 motherboard
we could find it was actually reviewed
in this video right here rather
extensively now I know what you're
thinking a 1300 X come on Greg you'd be
just fine with the 1200 this is wasted
money and you're right in all honesty
our 1200 sample was a bit preoccupied at
time of filming but we're linking it
down below in place to the 1300 X
because the frequency disparity alone in
our testing wall cut heavily into your
frame rates that and a 1300 X is
virtually out of stock everywhere thanks
to Black Friday sales so at 77 bucks on
Amazon I'd say the 1200 will do just
fine
it'll also run super cool and the stock
cooler thanks to its ultra low TDP and
the lack of overclocking support on our
a320 chipset the RAM we're sporting is
tuned specifically for rise in platforms
meaning we had no problems at all
reaching 3,000 megahertz even on this
cheap am 4 board higher frequencies are
important for aizen we've discussed this
in previous videos Layton sees between
CC X's are tied directly to the speed
and the lower frequencies can negatively
impact gaming performance as a result
this particular kit consists of 2 8 gig
modules for 16 in total which is
becoming the recommended minimum for a
lot of newer titles total costs it's
about 130 bucks but you could find
cheaper kits again I'm stressin
the frequency in this case stuff isn't
really optimized for the chipset won't
likely run it rated frequencies out of
the box on 1st gen Rison and of all of
my rated rise in samples this many of
them allowed me to run action p out of
the box that's zero
there are certainly trade-offs here and
I just decided to approach it with the
best Ram kit we could buy in around $120
price range the black also looks pretty
sweet with our black cooler and board as
well up next is our graphics card this
is a GTX 970 from EVGA I covered it in
this dedicated video or right here but I
sincerely believe this to be one of the
best bargain buys of 2018 even the 92 TI
for some upper level gaming in 1440p but
for 1080p a medium to high settings the
GTX 970 just it takes the cake in my
book it clocks in just below a typical 6
gig GTX 1060 which often costs two to
three times more
I mean sure comparing a used product to
anyone it's a bit unfair and you'll
certainly have less luck buying used
versus new but I think you'll be alright
in most cases people willing to lie and
sell you stuff that doesn't work over a
site like eBay have to deal with the
buyer protection guarantee nine times
out of ten I'll say you'll get your
money back without a hitch at all if the
product wasn't as advertised most people
just aren't gonna waste your time you'll
always hear the outlier louder than
anyone else or didn't get my money back
you pay rip me off but eBay is popular
for a reason and if they had these
reputation issues nobody would use them
I think it's a great place to
potentially save a lot of cash on
especially a graphics card will show
benchmarks by the way of the system a
little later in the video don't worry
next up we've got storage this is where
things become very preferential I try to
stay away from hard drives altogether
even in budget builds when SSDs are
cheap enough we picked up a couple of
500 gig Samsung 860 Evo's for 73 bucks
apiece on Black Friday and that price is
actually still holding true today you
can find them linked below half a
terabyte in my opinion is more than
enough for several larger games on Steam
and if you're anything like me you
really only play about two or three
games intently at a time so unless you
plan on installing your entire Steam
library onto a drive at one time one or
two of these will do just fine they'll
also load content significantly faster
than their hard drive counterparts we
installed one 500 gig drive into this
system and if the user feels the need to
say add additional storage in the future
for games
throwing
one terabyte hard drive or two won't be
an issue in a case like the cylon many
we used here one of the last things we
have to cover in this build is the power
supply and some people will swear by
only like 80 plus a golden higher rated
units but in a budget bill that isn't
likely to consume above say 300 plots
and that's a liberal estimate a 500 watt
unit with at least an 80 plus rating
will do just fine a lot of my earlier
builds in the channel that were under
$1000 supported 500 watt EBG ApS use
with a mere 80 plus bronze rating they
were quiet and almost as power efficient
by energy saved as their significantly
higher rated units right so 80 plus
sufficient at 500 Watts consumed results
in the same power saved as a 90%
efficient at a thousand watts consumed
and that's exactly why higher wattage
units typically have higher 80-plus
efficiencies the unit we went with here
is the corsair vs 551 it's a 550 watt 80
plus non modular power supply it stays
actually pretty quiet under loads quiter
and i thought it would be and yeah I
mean that's something I didn't expect
for a $40.00 unit sure cables are the
ugly and ketchup and mustard kind but
you can't expect too much had such an
affordable component oh and also to
touch on the used market for power
supplies and storage drives just a bit I
think those are the two things that I
would try to avoid on the used market
and I say that for a few reasons for one
failure rates for older cheaper power
supplies especially are typically a lot
higher and these are the parts of your
system that can potentially take other
components with them including another
big failure point motherboards and let
me tell ya motherboards are a pain to
troubleshoot they're the last thing you
hope breaks in a system but it happens
more often than you probably think
storage drives are the same way I mean
you really have no idea how many times
did has been wiped from them and they
have a certain you know rewrite rate a
certain number of rewrite times that
each drive will hold and until you do
some digging and physically connect the
drive you've got really no idea what
data actually might still be on the try
from the previous owner could have
viruses could have something else a it's
it's definitely like tinfoil hat time
here with with these two but and just to
play it safe my rule of thumb if you can
afford the extra 10 or 20 bucks for each
unit they're typically not too expensive
to begin with it just makes more sense
to buy something with a better warranty
and that is new so you have more peace
of mind if it doesn't work out of the
just return it hassle-free and you'll
get something new very soon
now on to performance I'm always
impressed with how great these rising
CPUs are from a value perspective I mean
sure for physical cores is kind of a
kick in the teeth all around in 2018 but
for well under a hundred bucks I mean
it's difficult to complain right a CPU
pushing out this kind of Cinebench score
or two or three years ago would have
cost around 200 bucks we're talking
about core i5 7400 territory from Intel
and we have the same core count here
right four cores similar frequencies
well at least two to virtually trade
blows and nearly all synthetic tests and
yeah I got 7400 at the time was actually
a really great budget game a CPU so on
two games Grand Theft Auto 5 was a
promising 1080p title for this rate
averaging nearly 100 FPS on high
settings all around save anti-aliasing
in advanced graphics all right say this
is a win for a 450 or so US dollar
computer and to top it off our 1% lowest
frame rates still averaged above 60
meaning even infrequent dips and
performance stay above an acceptable
threshold up next is a shadow of the
Tomb Raider and the high preset gave us
pretty much what we expected in 1080p
this is newer title it's pretty pretty
graphically intensive especially in the
DirectX 12 API overall our average FPS
was 53 just shy of our 60fps target in
this case a GPU was definitely our
limiting factor keeping things behind
approximately 94% of the time according
to the in-game benchmark witcher 3 is
another game we expect to perform
slightly worse than the status-quo
extremely GPU intensive our GTX 970
takes over a majority of the load here
despite the game only running in the
default high preset shelling out an
average 53 FPS with our lowest 1% of
frames rendered dropping to a mere 43 on
average and like this isn't terrible by
any means but this is still an exception
to the 60 FPS floor we're trying to stay
above else we're dropping settings to
medium should pick up the slack though
Oh an FYI which are three cripples even
high-end systems but cheaper rigs will
suffer greatly so playing around with
individual settings is important in my
opinion if you insist on keeping say
anti-aliasing around which is pretty
graphically intensive make sure it's
used sparingly nothing more than say
times 2 for any of these titles
up next is pub G still not optimized for
older platforms and still very choppy
even in the high preset we did manage
well above 60fps on
average but the full story has revealed
in our 1% lows a mere 45 isn't gonna cut
it I mean that's nearly half of our
average frame rate in this case it means
that we're gonna have quite the chop
when we're gaming that's a terrible
experience all around for a game of this
caliber pretty fast-paced and
competitive fortnight yields a much more
playable experience and almost always
does with respect to its pub G
counterpart F 1 2017 provided an
excellent in-game experience in the high
preset our budget rig pumped out 100 FPS
get that on average and the high preset
with the lowest 1% of frames dropping
just to a mere 90 I mean that's no big
deal right this is pretty sweet actually
especially when seen in the context of a
racing game right with questionable
weather conditions and high speed turns
though in general racing games do run
smoother than their first-person-shooter
counterparts and this maps are much
smaller more consolidated and detail in
this case is strictly emphasized on the
road so our system doesn't really break
a sweat here and all in all I think
anyone on a tight budget would be very
impressed with the performance this
little machines packing we've got the
SSD with ample storage for quick boot
times and plenty of files and games a
solid graphics card a proper quad-core
CPU despite having stock cooler it's
actually very quiet a quiet power supply
as well and a case that gets the job
done for cheap while looking good at the
same time feel free to play around with
a different parts link below and build
something similar for yourself or a
friend of saving money as a top priority
look there's nothing wrong with saving
money at all and I think most of us have
been in a situation where we're pretty
tight on cash and you want to squeeze
that as much value as you can nothing
wrong with that at all so that's a wrap
folks I do hope you've enjoyed this one
budget builds are always fun and I have
plans to build more like this very soon
