actually those are kind of cool isn't it
look cool and it's white and black folks
you know me micro ATX z170 gigabyte g1
gaming motherboard you're just like
there's security with earpieces and like
you know their official native earpieces
actually need one of these I want to
start playing racing games how much are
they so it's only do these are actually
kind of cheap how did especially Alex we
don't allow filming enough still awesome
so we already got all of our oh yeah
sorry okay so the way we do things here
in the studio is a little unorthodox we
don't ask for permission to film in
stores even when we kind of sort of
might possibly know or not know that
they do or do not allow filming in their
store so what we did with this micro
Center was just walk right in start
filming we got about an hour maybe an
hour 15 minutes worth of footage before
security was called in the store and
they promptly told us to stop recording
now we did talk to the guy we told them
who we were what we were doing there I
mean we're not like downing the store or
anything like that we're just checking
out their cool prices at low prices for
the most part the guy gave me is his
business card Daniel II IV works here at
the Marietta micro center we will do is
it the next Micro Center tomorrow I
don't know if we can ask for permission
or not
I might just we might have try to do the
same thing again it kind of just depends
I don't know Jake what do you think oh
yeah we're not asking okay but I can ask
we're just going we're just gonna go in
and we're gonna try to see if that one
little bit poor on the camera policy and
we'll also see if they give us a 9 the
scenes tour of what goes on in the back
of these stores a lot of them build pcs
for clients so maybe we'll be able to
catch a couple of those builds see what
they're scoring in those that's the
best-case scenario worst-case scenarios
we kicked out five minutes into filming
so uh stay tuned for that
