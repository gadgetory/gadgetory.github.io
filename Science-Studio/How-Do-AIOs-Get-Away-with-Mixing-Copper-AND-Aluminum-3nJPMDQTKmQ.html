video we're gonna talk about galvanic
corrosion and the why you see it in
certain custom loops but why you don't
see it usually in a iOS because if you
tend to combine something like an
aluminum radiator which we see quite a
bit of from company like Thermaltake and
then a copper or nickel plated copper
CPU block then we've got a problem right
but that's what a iOS do and somehow a
iOS can get away with that and you don't
hear too many horror stories about
galvanic corrosion taking place at least
in the short term with an AI oh like a
course or h 100 i so why are the two
different saying is that they're using
the exact same metal combos what exactly
is galvanic corrosion galvanic corrosion
I must infer that word and then what can
you do and custom loop to mitigate it
should you be worried about kits that
include aluminum rads and copper and
nickel plated copper blocks because that
was the topic that came up quite a bit
in my previous video which you can check
out right here so we're gonna answer all
those questions in this one I'll try to
keep it short and sweet not gonna get
too scientific but in a nutshell here's
what you need to know
here's what you really need to know
about the difference between copper and
aluminum alumina is more reactive it's
an active metal in the sense that it
will behave like an anode when it's put
into a loop with copper which is going
to be the cathode and whenever have an
anode cathode arrangement the anode will
be stripped of its molecules during that
galvanic corrosion process so aluminum
will react if it's raw pure aluminum
with air and it will form aluminum oxide
now the same thing happens to copper I
mean technically everything oxidizes but
the process is much slower and that's
why it's just a bit more stable in the
long run now people will take this point
and say well that's why I shouldn't use
aluminum it's cheaper and oxidizes
quicker it's just a less noble metal to
be using in a custom loop and yeah it's
definitely cheaper it's a lot lighter it
has a different thermal properties than
copper copper is a bit more conductive
aluminum lets go of heat a bit more
there's an argument there about which is
better in the long run for a CPU or GPU
cooler but that argument aside what I
want you to take away from this is that
yes aluminum is slightly more reactive
but as its own standalone metal it's not
bad to use in a loop what can cause
problems is when you combine something
like an aluminum radiator with a copper
CPU block or I don't know whatever else
would be copper in here to a copper
graphics card block now a few of you
pointed out in our thermal take water
cooling kit video that they included an
aluminum radiator which I've been using
for a long time a lot of people don't
like them because they use aluminum rads
I'm not the biggest fan of them and for
obvious reasons I think it's a
cost-saving measure I also think that it
does induce problems if you want to take
that radiator and throw it into another
loop that will use primarily copper or
nickel plated copper you're gonna run
into problems especially if you're using
a coolant designed to mitigate the
galvanic effects of using copper in a
loop so I think it's just kind of a
slippery slope and they're doing it
ultimately to save money so yeah I'd
like to see the aluminum rads gone for
sure that's a one downside of going with
a thermal take radiator or just a
thermal take kit that will include a
radiator like that but you guys went so
far as to say well what are they doing
here they just sold a kit that has an
aluminum rad and then a copper or nickel
plated copper CPU block doesn't that
mean that their system is going to
corrode very quickly right because
you shouldn't mix both metals that's
that's not how it works and there's an
important distinction between having
first off bare aluminum and bare copper
and a loop right with a water let's say
which will act as your electrolyte right
that transfers that material from the
anode to the cathode that is the process
that takes place and it can happen very
fast or very slow depending on the
different chemical zeebad in the water
and that's why the coolant is so
important so see 1,000 clear designed by
thermal take is supposed to mitigate the
galvanic effects of running an aluminum
rad with a nickel-plated copper block or
a GPU that has a nickel plated copper
block integrated inside of that so we're
gonna run some tests with this
ultimately but what I will say at this
point is that yes
using this coolant right here will
significantly slow down the process of
galvanic corrosion versus using let's
say distilled water think of anodes and
cathodes like pressure differentials
right so if aluminum is an active metal
and copper is relatively inactive then
the aluminum has a higher pressure and
the copper has a lower pressure so
material is gonna flow from the higher
pressure variant to the lower pressure
variant that's that flow that's that
galvanic corrosion the electrochemical
properties of both metals are what are
essentially driving that chemical
process so and of course you need your
medium which is water that electrolyte
to transfer those those particles from
one metal to the other I'm trying to do
this without actually having a script
because I want to make sure that I have
all these points down and that's why the
video is being kind of broken up a bit
but in that situation would be fine
because you've combined the same metal
everywhere and you're using a medium
that is not inherently you know reactive
and that's water so that's good but if
you decided to throw in an aluminum rat
instead then you would have a pretty
accelerated that form of galvanic
corrosion taking place in your loop and
you would notice that the aluminum would
begin corroding quite a bit and it would
probably begin to wear away the surface
of the copper because you're stripping
the aluminum of its molecules and
basically being very abrasive right with
that copper surface that the fluid comes
into contact with on top of that the
introduction of aluminum into the fluid
itself can corrode literally corrode or
oxidize the copper which is why copper
sometimes turns green or in dark brown
when it's been running in a loop for a
long time untreated that is
literally oxidation and corrosion taking
place due to the fluid and the chemicals
and the additives that shouldn't
necessarily be in the water or whatever
coolant is being used in the loop now
what about a iOS how do all in one
liquid coolers for CPUs or graphics
cards get away with combining typically
aluminum radiators with copper or nickel
plated copper CPU blocks because if you
think about it like let's look at a deep
pool captain 240 X right that's a copper
CPU block it might be nickel-plated on
the inside it really doesn't matter
because nickel and copper are pretty
close to each other on the on the
reactivity series and you will have a
degree of Kelvin and corrosion there
regardless of if nickel is reactive on
its own or not to the introduction of
two metals with an electrolyte is never
a good thing so how do they get away
with it and it comes back to the coolant
again so a is actually use a special
anti corrosive coolant it's not gonna be
the same it's not gonna be uniform for
every AO out there but most of them use
like let's say a Sutekh pumps with a
certain degree of aluminum and the
radiator and the copper or nickel plated
copper and the block are going to have a
special coolant that prevents for a
certain degree of time any substantial
degree of galvanic corrosion typically
what'll happen with a IO first is either
the pump will fail or you'll have a leak
in the system either near the radiator
connection with the tubing or the CPU
blocks connection with the tubing the
block itself won't leak unless it's
using some very cheap plastic housing
and it just snaps under pressure and the
radiator won't leak either in most cases
because it's solid metal the
manufacturers of these products know
this and that's why the warranties
usually extend to the point where they
expect a d5 pump to fail it's around
four or five years or so that's when you
get a really good a IO and you have no
other issues apart from that now
galvanic corrosion might play a small
role in allowing the pump to fail again
you'd be certain you know circulating
aluminum particles throughout the loop
over and over and over again those
channels get clogged up you have a lot
of back pressure the pump could fail
right but galvanic corrosion again it
does not it does not happen anywhere
near the degree you guys probably think
it does in an IO because of those anti
corrosive additives which are very
effective in a small closed system so
why they do manufacturers use nickel
plating over copper cpu blocks let's say
or graphics card blocks you know even if
they aren't using aluminum rad
that's how you know that it's not
because of the anti corrosive properties
of nickel because nickel and copper are
actually very similar they will both act
as cathode so when you introduce
aluminum into a closed loop with an
electrolyte like water this was
something for the longest time I did not
know I honestly believe that nickel
plating prevented galvanic corrosion but
in truth and nickel and copper very
similar in terms of how they behave is
cathodes when aluminum again is
introduced in the loop so yeah
interesting something I learned
throughout this process and what it
ultimately comes back to is the coolant
use the coolant additives are supposed
to mitigate the effects the long-term
effects of galvanic corrosion
now those additives might wear off over
time and that might be the extent to
which an AIO warranty let's say it lasts
but what you really should be concerned
about is a type of fluid that you're
adding into a loop that might mix
aluminum radiators with copper or nickel
plated copper blocks we've seen horror
stories of you know galvanic corrosion
taking place in custom loops we all know
what it looks like we don't want it and
that's why a lot of people tend to be
very weary of aluminum radiators I don't
blame you look if that's the reason why
you don't buy a thermal take kit I'm not
trying to sell you on these and then so
be it
I understand why I've worked with both
aluminum and copper rads and I
understand that copper is definitely a
better radiator type to use because most
of the CPU and GPU blocks out there are
nickel plated or bare copper blocks so
in terms of compatibility yeah copper is
better but in terms of the material used
in general it's not aluminum's fault
it's just the fact that companies tend
to want to combine both because aluminum
when it comes to a radiator is fairly
cheap you know a aluminum radiator and
compared to a copper radiator there's a
huge difference in terms of how much
each weighs and aluminum is much cheaper
in general than copper so yeah it's a
cost IV measure and I think that
ultimately what it comes back to but you
shouldn't just you know cry red flag
when you see these two things combined
especially in a kit look if Thermaltake
knew that galvanic corrosion is going to
take place in our rather accelerated
scale they wouldn't bother combining
these difference of tests this is why
they recommend c1000 coolant and that's
why it's included in the kit because it
is supposed to mitigate to a very
substantial extent to galvanic corrosion
that would otherwise take place so you
can take that with a grain of salt you
can take it if a
value I really don't care but just know
that a iOS do it all the time they
literally all the time and this isn't
the exact same fluid the exact same coin
that you'll find in a i/o but it's very
similar it has similar properties and
its ultimate goal is again to allow heat
transfer right that's the purpose of
getting heat from the CPU block to the
radiators and water has in general very
high heat capacity so it's a great fluid
for that but it's also to mitigate those
effects of galvanic corrosion that would
otherwise take place if you just had a
bare copper or nickel plated copper in a
closed system with bare aluminum and
water as an electrolyte so hope you guys
enjoy this video I'm sorry that was a
little scattered but this was something
I was just reading about recently a lot
of you brought up this issue and I felt
like making a dedicated video regarding
this topic because you see it all the
time right you see with a iOS and if
you've ever wondered how an AI Oh gets
away with it
it's the fluid it's the the anti
corrosive properties in the fluid that
prevent to galvanic corrosion from
taking place on a long term scale and in
general when you see a kit like thermal
take like thermal takes em 360 plus it
we reviewed combined and aluminum rad
with a nickel plated copper CPU block be
sure to use the fluid that they include
in the kit there's a reason why it's
there they tell you to only use this for
their kits and the reason why is because
if you don't if you use something from
primo chill or Mayhem's or what have you
then you are nine times out of ten maybe
even nine point nine nine nine times out
of ten gonna have issues with build up
with gunk in your loop because of the
two different metals being combined in
the same closed system I me know what
