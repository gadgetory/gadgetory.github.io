underrated PC tech companies on the
planet they make excellent cases air
coolers and a iOS and now made even
better with RGB integration I've already
reviewed the regular captain 240 X in a
separate video you can find it via the
link right here the good news is the
captain 240 x RGB doesn't deviate from
the regular captain's design so let's
discuss features you'll still find the
uniform CPU block to be identical good
stuff it can be rotated any which way
thanks to the absence of one-way
branding as well so no upside-down text
something I've always liked about the
captions the two blinks however is a bit
shorter than normal this is how it is
with all captain's by the way you may be
forced to either mount it up top or in
front of your case depending on its
dimensions tf1 20s covered the 240
millimeter radiator and all black which
is nice they do an excellent job of
dissipating heat but they are quite loud
past roughly 50% so tweak your fan curve
accordingly deep calls opted for an
aluminum thinner a for their captain 240
X's and the RGB model is no different
it's actually a good choice many will
swear by copper but aluminum will
release the heat quicker as copper tends
to conduct and carry heat longer wants
to hold on to that heat not release it
as quickly you will find a copper base
under the CPU block though which is good
in a nutshell you want something to
conduct the heat quickly away from the
CPU hence the copper here and you want
something to release the heat quickly
from the radiator
hence the aluminium but to be frank
swapping either side with the
alternative won't change much this
config here isn't a concern from a
thermodynamic standpoint now let's dive
into the key differences between the
regular captains and the RGB captains
the first of these is perhaps the most
obvious the fact that you can change the
color inside the CPU blocks rather than
just the laisse white or the red that
you get with a regular captain's you get
to choose the color yourself here now
there is a catch to this we'll talk
about it later the fact is you can
practically change this color to
whatever you want and that's a good
thing for those who are looking for
customization and just RGB in general
colors are fairly accurate and modes are
easy to distinguish and here's a bonus
equal also includes an RGB LED strip to
sync up with the waterblock
pretty cool if you ask me so now you get
case lighting and CPU cooling in the
same box good guy DC the catch that I
mentioned earlier though is that if you
want to change the color of the strip
and the
CPU block they don't act separately so
if you change the color of one the color
of the other will also change you have
to use the wired remote the problem with
that though is that if you want to use
the wired remote you have to have access
to it obviously and if you put your
cables in your case you have to open up
your case to change the colors so it
kind of sucks there are a few ways
around this you can run an included
adapter into an RGB header on your
motherboard asus or for example but not
every board boasts this feature cheap
boards forget it
90x configs are sure to be left out
unless you're willing to spend hundreds
of dollars wireless system would have
made this the perfect captain upgrade
but the cable in my opinion is extremely
restrictive the Achilles heel of this
entire unit unless your content on one
color period changing modes will be a
bit of a hassle now I suppose the
counter-argument to this would be well
if you already have a color scheme in
mind why would you want to change it
midway through your pcs life right
that's the point of RGB if you want a
red color scheme you just set it to red
and that's it that's all you need to do
so you don't need to change it over and
over or you can just set it to the
rainbow effect and let it do its crazy
thing but my counter-argument to that
counter argument would be well how do
you know what color that strips can be
set to out of the box you don't know if
it's set to blue green red purple yellow
you have no idea so you have to actually
plug that strip into into the whole
system here and then change that color
before you even build it inside your
case or just kind of work with it as
you're building but it's still a pain
you know having a remote is simple I
don't think it would have cost them much
more to do that you know but that's just
what they went let's so keep it in mind
changing colors is a bit of a pain with
the new system again though I don't
think that for most of you it's going to
be that big a deal if you have a color
scheme already in mind but other than
that cork which I wouldn't call anything
other than a quirk or cost-saving
measure everything else of this kit is
satisfactory it cools about as well as
the previous generation despite claims
for 10% better heat dissipation over the
block and stronger pump but that's
beside the point
you'll still hit excellent clock speeds
on unlocked CPUs and keep core temps
nice and cool remember you won't reduce
the heat coming from the CPU with this
AIO but you will better mitigate it
that's the point of a iOS in general the
240 X was already a great one as was the
120 counterpart if you can find them for
good prices I still recommend that you
buy them there they're excellent a iOS
for the price but the 240 X RGB and the
one
20-millimeter counterpart add the extra
customization that many were asking for
especially with the RGB frenzy going
absolutely crazy nowadays it's an
improvement that won't break the bank
even get added benefits like an RGB LED
strip and a fan hub that I didn't
mention earlier so you call is throwing
in things that they don't have to throw
in to make this a better building
experience better user experience for
all of you it's why light deep cool so
much bang for the buck this is the
company for you if you like this video
be sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs
down for the opposite click subscribe
but if you haven't already I will catch
you in the next video as always links to
the product showcase here down in the
video description or tie to my amazon
link so I get a small kickback if you do
purchase something via the link I do
appreciate it this is science to do
