enter max before and they actually sent
a bunch of stuff for a giveaway them and
gigabyte will be kind of coordinating
with our channel to give away one big PC
and I always seeing that coming in the
next video so stay tuned for that but
for now I wanted to do an impromptu
review of the same array because this
case is very peculiar it's a very large
mid-tower by definition 7 PCI slots at
the rear but you'll see why there are
some problems some of which you can
mitigate I'll show you how in this video
but the whole thing is just it's
different and depending on who you are
that might be a good or a bad thing
Thermal Grizzly's carbonate pads offer
peace of mind ease of installation and
industry standard performance in a
market crowded with mediocre thermal
compounds our own testing confirms that
they conduct heat appropriately and
provide a safe and consistent membrane
between the Dyer IHS and cooler best of
all you can grab them in several sizes
and reuse them as many times as you'd
like
carbonate pads are a peace of mind in my
book and they're very consistent and
that's why I use them for CPU testing
check them out via the link below so I
had to zoom all the way out of my wide
lens to get this entire case in frame
and that's just a testament to how large
it actually is so there's about an inch
and a half and two inches of space below
the actual case itself these feet are
massive but it keeps it rather sturdy a
lot of the build construction here
especially on the exterior is plastic
which is a bit disappointing but because
of the feet are so wide they've actually
done a good job at least keeping it
stable while it's on a desk and then on
top you've got another inch and 1/2 of 2
inches of just extra space if you wanted
to push-pull config you are Flo here in
a second but this is just a case that
can kind of fit anything you could
possibly want within reason right so up
to a 360 ml up front
I believe you can support up to it looks
like a 360 ml up top but I'll have to
look up whether or not that is actually
the case because there's also an optical
drive bay little area up front which is
convenient for some of you who want the
CD drive the DVD drive whatever that's
an option you don't have to use it
though and the good thing is it doesn't
look terrible when you don't include an
optical drive if some cases have that
extra space and it just looks really
weird and unused
but NMX has done a decent job filling
out the extra space Animax does offer
this case in white and black variance
which is convenient obviously for this
kind of configured have been better but
that's not that's not their fault this
is just what I use for every case review
for obvious reasons you have two large
LED strips up top and up front they're
actually interconnected it can be
controlled by a one button up top and
they off connect to a fan hub also acts
as an RGB LED hub at the rear the only
bad thing about this integrated hub is
the fact that you only get three pin fan
support which is a bit disappointing so
you're only not voltage control here the
good thing is the fans are they include
you get four from pilot away three of
which are RGB LED integrated up front
are also three pin fans so you're going
to only have voltage control which means
you can't get them super quiet but to my
surprise they actually kind of could for
from being voltage fans the the natural
rpm state of these fans is pretty low so
if you're running on one like the first
setting which you can even configure up
top there's a little fan controller up
there they're actually super quiet so
I'm not really going to complain for
once about the fact that there's only
voltage control on this hub speaking of
those fans so three up front are 120mm
fans the RGB is kind of wrap around the
entire fan frame which is a unique look
and then at the rear you get a single
140 mm fan it's not the quietest but it
does have like rubber vibration mounts
and things that you would expect to find
in $150 case which is what this is
roughly gonna run you and erected a
great job including rubber grommets here
you get to up top for those two large
cutouts above the motherboard you also
get two of the basement which is not
something we're used to seeing usually
those at the bottom don't have rubber
grommets these do it looks really clean
cleans up the cables you also get a PCIe
cutout as well it's not as wide as I
would like so again to eight pins is
gonna kind of crunch those at the base
but it's a nice inclusion nonetheless
now as for the area next to the
motherboard tray itself this is where
the the design cube it's a little
questionable because first off you get
no rubber grommets at all for like the
24 pin or a USB 3.0 or you type C
whatever you don't get that at all
there's just a little kind of space
there for you to wrap cables it's an
indented area so you have space to
actually mount to
fans although the exhaust array on the
right panel is not very forgiving the
cutouts themselves are very restricted
so I don't have a feeling these would be
very functional also if you choose not
to populate that area with fans which is
what I've done here it just looks a
little bare and you can see through it
you can see the cables that you're
routing behind it it's a convenient
place to route cables but I tried my
best to keep those out of the way for
this build because it just looks really
dumb in my opinion to have all those
cables kind of exposed like the whole
point is to hide those behind them on
the board tray so it's kind of a
catch-22 you want to put most of your
cables behind that section of the tray
because there's more space there behind
the motherboard tray directly there's
only about 3/4 of an inch worth of
clearance that's not enough for a lot of
the thicker cables especially if you're
running like cable extensions or even
with the fan hub there it just makes
things rather cluttered now so you're
gonna want to put those cables again
near this little double fan mount
indention next to the motherboard tray
and it's just there's no cover there I
would like Animax to include some sort
of like modular cover to block that off
so that you can freely run cables there
and that would be perfect similar to
what fractal design does or what fantex
does we don't have that though so it was
a it was difficult
needless to say to keep those cables out
of sight and I still couldn't I couldn't
make it perfect clearly you also have a
large cutout in the basement for a
fairly thick rat I would say definitely
around forty five millimeter thick rod
should fit as long as you keep the stock
fans in front of that frame PSU support
down below in terms of length is
adequate you actually have room to stuff
extra cables even with a slightly
extended ATX power supply you've also
got a hard drive cage down below with
two tooless hard drive brackets that is
convenient and then two dedicated SSD
brackets behind the motherboard tray now
pet peeve of mine with white jassi's is
tinted tempered glass not a big fan of
that especially with these kinds of
cases because you want to be able to see
the fact that the internals are white
and you can't do that with tinted glass
especially if using like other white
components all you're going to see are
the LEDs when your build is on so in
this case enter max actually did a good
job at least in my opinion you might not
with me here but I really like that this
is like very slightly tinted tempered
glass so you can see everything inside
even when the build is off individual
components it's very easy to do and it
looks really good
speaking of tempered glass the Left
panel is the only place you'll find it
and there are four thumb screws that
hold it in place and with questionable
Phillips screw inclusion I'm not sure
why they did this I my concern wouldn't
be that these would come loose tear and
shipping it would be you know someone
like slamming a Phillips screwdriver
into it or kicking it when in they're
shipping it right UPS FEDEX
we all know that stuff like that happens
so I'm not sure why they did this but
it's they're very easy to remove without
a tool so maybe some of these come over
to work but yeah that and the fact that
they are also like bare steel or
whatever this metal or alloy is these
could have been black and I think it
would have looked a lot better so that's
the another design key that I think they
really could have touched on it is nicer
that you have a black trim going around
the outside of the tempered glass it's
it's all stuck to the chassis itself and
this makes for a little smoother
tempered glass application and it's not
gonna be rubbing against this steel or
plastic frame as for the right panel
again we've had these small slits here
for questionable amounts of airflow I'm
not even gonna test this because it just
doesn't look very practical but there
are only two thumb screws needed to hold
this in place and they're both up top
the bottom of the panel just kind of
slides into the frame so a little easier
installation on this side but nothing
really worth getting too excited about
now speaking of air flow that's what I
want to focus the remainder of this
video on because this was interesting
and I had to run four separate tests
because Animax includes an optional mesh
front panel and there's apparently also
an optional mesh top panel the mesh was
already included on top of this one but
the stock config is to have it's like an
acrylic front panel and acrylic top
panel and that completely closes off
both sides so obviously wouldn't be
ideal to have both of those installed
you could put the acrylic up top if you
have enough fans up top but then also
putting it up front will completely
choke these fans you'll see temperature
results here in a second it totally
makes sense what you're seeing because
there's there's no air at all for these
fans up front to pull this is what
that panel looks like again I'm assuming
it's acrylic because it's flexible it's
not a glass that's probably most of you
are concerned about and nonetheless it's
going to completely block air flow
especially when mounted up front now I
do have the mesh installed up front and
up top for obvious reasons we want to
maximize airflow get it as close to
ideal as possible in these scenarios and
stock the mesh config also didn't do
that well actually only lowered our CPU
temps by one degree swapping from this
to the mesh and I know what you're
thinking there's no way that's possible
Greg this is way more porous this is
this is literally like completely
blocked off at least there's some space
up the front right well the way you're
seeing it now I've modified it it's very
easy to do I'm going to show you what I
did and that will drastically reduce
your temperatures so there are three
separate layers that make up this mesh
front panel first off you've got that
white kind of honeycomb frame underneath
that's needed for structural rigidity
not gonna mess up really much of
anything in terms of airflow the
uppermost layer is a hole-punch metal
grille and the middle layer is another
hole punched metal grille I think they
wanted this one to act as the dust
filter the problem with that thinking is
that okay so they got the holes about
this size right well the holes on the
the uppermost metal grille are about the
same size so that's already doing
whatever job this was going to do in
terms of blocking duska preventing dust
from getting into your case they put two
here for redundancy but what that does
is max oblique choke your airflow so
what I did was I removed this central
panel the uppermost metal grille kind of
wraps around the white honeycomb frame
you can remove that by bending these
tabs around the perimeter and then you
can remove very easily this metal dust
filter here in the middle actually I
made sure this is metal it probably
isn't it's you know the typical ones
that you find in most cases problem is
when you have this also stacked against
another one that's just like this you're
literally cutting airflow again in half
and that's not ideal and that is why our
temperatures looked bad so you can see
with the front panel on completely
covered with that acrylic the CPU
reached 90 degrees Celsius and the GPU
reached 71 that's actually the hottest I
think we've
had our GPU get for any of our case
tests I might be wrong with it I'm
pretty sure that's the hardest I've ever
seen it and that means that our graphics
card is really getting no airflow and
also at the rear of this case the PCI
slot covers are a little more restricted
we don't have that typical hole punch
kind of mesh at the rear we have these
little vertical slits in each of the
slots and I just think that this is
reducing the amount of area that the
graphics card can pull in from the rear
and then with the acrylic panel swapped
for the mesh panel as it comes stock in
the box remember with technically to
dust filters in there the CPU was still
at 90 degrees Celsius after 15 minutes
of i-64 engineer and the GPU dropped by
one degree Celsius that tells me that
our entire system is still being choked
for air so at this point I got curious I
remove the front panel entirely this
test would act as our control that
lowered CPU temps to 79 degrees Celsius
our GPU level off at 64 degrees Celsius
this is in line with other cases that
I've reviewed with this exact config
that tells us that again acting is our
control there's nothing inherently wrong
with the way I am testing the case and
then the last thing I did was remove
this middle dust filter now yes you're
going to have a bit more dust
creep its way into your case over time
but which are you more concerned about a
little bit of dust or your system
running ten degrees hotter and that's
almost exactly what a CPU temps were
lowered by in the case of the modded
front panel CPU times have dropped to 83
degrees Celsius that's a 7 degree
difference just by removing this right
here and the GPU dropped to 67 degrees
Celsius it's another 3 or 4 degrees
Celsius drop again just by removing this
right here so it's pretty incredible to
see how something like this just by
removing this can drastically reduce
those temperatures for the CPU and the
graphics core if you have this stuck
against another one like this it becomes
almost as restrictive as an acrylic or
tempered glass front panel that is a
shame frankly it's something that I
think edimax just overlooked or didn't
think about and so I strongly urge them
in future revisions of this case and
others to forego the second dust filter
especially you're going to use a filter
up front that already looks like this to
begin with it's this is going to do the
job in and of itself right you're going
to have a little bit more dust come in
because your
choking it but you're choking airflow as
well at the expense of also choking dust
and to me that's just not a compromise
or if considering so in general my
assumptions about this case we're true
when I first pulled out that front panel
it's like there's no way that this thing
is going to be anywhere near as porous
as they probably think it is I didn't
expect it to be literally as choking as
this is that was a surprise
but I had my doubts when I first pulled
out the mesh front panels like there's
no way another cool thing about this I
didn't talk about you can remove this
very simply by clicking here in here and
then it just slides out so there's two
little tabs that kind of punch into the
chassis up top and then there's two
little feet that slide into the chassis
at the base and that was how easy it was
to remove again when you put two of
these in there it's just you can you can
barely even see through it and and
that's a testament to how restrictive it
is in terms of airflow just based on the
amount of light that it allows through
it when you remove one of these it
becomes suddenly much more transparent
it's still restrictive but it's a lot
less restrictive than it was before let
me see if I can do this without there we
go well it's literally that easy like
it's a really nice feature of this case
it also works up top the same way so
very easy to remove that's a plus and it
just makes modifying the front panel the
top panel that much easier so this takes
like 20 seconds do it if you buy this
case it will make a world of difference
and you might have to clean your PC one
extra time every six months because
you'll have maybe a little more dust in
your case as a result but it's a worthy
trade-off in my book in terms of my
thoughts about the value of this chassis
I think it's okay it's not great it's
not it's certainly not the best case
I've ever reviewed but it's it's far
from the worst case I've ever reviewed
either there are some design cues that I
would like to see address especially
with that just huge gap next to the
motherboard tray it just looks a little
weird to me the price is a bit high now
but you are getting things that some
people will pay extra for like the huge
RGB D RGB inclusion up top and up front
the control panel a huge fan hub a huge
RGB controller at the rear
and plenty of hardware support so if
twosome they might see this justified
I'm not going to dock it for the price
but I'm not going to praise it either at
150 or so USD so I'll let you conclude
however you feel necessary to conclude
in the comment section below I'm gonna
give this just an average score do I
feel comfortable giving this away
especially with the caliber build going
in it in the next video absolutely
especially when you modify the front and
top panels it's good to go
with that you can find this case link
down below in the video description you
can also find other parts that we've
used here for this exact configuring
similar maybe in the black version of
the animatics a beret then then feel
free to do that I think it would look
really good in black especially with
these components but the component we're
going to throw into this case before the
giveaway are going to be primarily white
so it should fit the theme a bit better
again stay tuned for that feel like this
video a thumbs up you know what to do if
you can sign it for the giveaway coming
up next thumbs up that would be
appreciated click the subscribe button
stay in the loop become a member feeling
especially fancy and we will catch you
