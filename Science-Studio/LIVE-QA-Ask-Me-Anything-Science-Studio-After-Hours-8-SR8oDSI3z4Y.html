live yet then I'm awkwardly talking to
myself and of course we are bound to
have a few audio issues I'm checking yep
okay looks good
sorry you guys are awkwardly looking at
me looking at my screen it's a little
confusing sometimes
so anyways welcome to another episode of
after hours alright guys that's not
really an episode it's just another what
would you call this is it is it an
episode or what am I looking for here
there's a word I'm looking for anyway
what's going on folks I am sorry that I
did not start right when the timer goes
off I try to make sure things are you
know triple check before I click the
live button because if anything goes
terribly wrong then yeah someone says
dude the hair is coiffed oh boy thanks
folks I appreciate it audio is God
blurry HD I am says audio is god that's
exactly what I wanted to hear thank you
for that all right so we have yeah this
is just a hangout by the way we're just
we're just hanging out here folks and
that's all I'm gonna start answering
questions here as soon as I can get to
them they're scrolling pretty quick I
appreciate all of the immediate
responses and those of you who are
watching it appears our YouTube live
thing is not working that's a little
weird
so it says we have zero people watching
that's totally cool I'm not you know I'm
not bitter it's fine people think no
one's watching not a problem no problem
also I would like to add that actually
you know what I'm fighting to go ahead
to get rid of this can I do this can I
click editor well it's well it's live
if this stream stops I apologize editor
no we're still good okay cool
viewer count let's just delete that all
right there we go and then back to the
live page
all right so folks let's go in start
answering some questions
thank you for the subscription off stop
he says I'm on YouTube and watching dude
camera is not focused it's actually
focused as this focus is gonna get I'm
using a webcam because I don't really
care about how good this looks I'm just
here to answer questions so get over it
no I can't I don't I can't make this any
better than it is it's just a cheap you
know c910 logitech camera so don't worry
about it
anyway let's see if galaxy s 9 camera or
DSLR for YouTube always that never I
wouldn't film with a phone that's just
in my experiences even with the newer
phones it's not worth it it's too
difficult to control especially when you
have the option like the fold-out screen
for a DSLR that's a big perk and then
manual controls and phones are pretty
finicky especially on video unless you
lock your autofocus you're gonna have
some issues with that exposure and
whatnot and it's just difficult to
calibrate when you're not sitting in the
chair let's see what different what are
different fan bearings for well I can
talk about fan design when it comes to
like case fans for PCs like bearings in
general just gonna you know if you have
a really terrible bearing it's gonna be
loud right so it's all about how little
friction you generate in the bearing
while the blade turns cuz it's just a
you know it's a pole it's a magnet and
then you have a coil of wire electricity
running through it and get those
shifting poles and that's why you get
the rotation of the motor but the number
of poles you have right the number of
magnets can affect things the types of
bearings that you have you know they
have fluid bearing fluid bearings you
have like the ball bearings so it's just
different ways of getting the thing to
rotate while trying to minimize friction
as much as possible but it's not really
a technical topic that's it really
matters in most cases PC fans are gonna
have trouble on the bearing level for
the most part they're gonna have trouble
with just like how how much air they're
displacing with their fins and then
again how much turbulence is created
based on how the fins are shaped that's
why we have all different fin shapes and
sizes it's just different ways of
pushing air through a frame let's see
now's your chance
plug that chair I I always use vertigo
chairs I've never made a secret of that
I use
a year for four here I have one next to
me that other chair for the other PC on
the desk is a vertical chair same one
actually because I like the white and
black and then I have a vert of your
trigger chair in the film room
I just really comfortable they really
are like some people don't like racing
chairs and that's cool that's why I have
the trigger chair in the other room
that's more of an ergonomic chair but to
be honest I like this one almost as much
if not more from a comfort level and
then aesthetically I think this looks
better too
Jonathan Bindy asks let's see here is a
1080 Ti and at 8700 K too much for a
1080p 144 Hertz setup you may be here's
how I look at it though so if you want
to go over the top right but you only
have a 1080p monitor that's let's say
even if it is 144 Hertz you're gonna
push all those frames easily in most
titles and with an with an 1080 Ti what
that gives you is a future-proof right
from a resolution standpoint so let's
say eventually get tired of 1080p you
know your dad or somebody like you know
gifts you a 1440p monitor you go out and
buy a 4k monitor then you're not gonna
have a problem from the 1080 a 1080i
standpoint because alright that's your
future proof from a resolution
standpoint your cpu is more future proof
from the frame rate standpoint so you
got the best of both worlds there's
nothing wrong with you know having a
lower resolution and a high refresh rate
in fact I would argue that having a
higher refresh rate is more important
than just the excuse me just the
resolution because like from this
distance here alright I'm using a 1080p
- as a bank you monitor 240 Hertz from
this distance I can't tell the
difference in between this resolution
and the 1440p resolution of my Asus
monitor right there and they're both
about the same size I think this one's
actually 24 inches 27 but still almost
the same actually the pixel density is
pretty similar - because that screen is
bigger but anyway I on a tangent there
this is uh this is just a way of doing
okay so Jerry Jenkins thank you all for
that one what is that one dollar and
forty five cents it's a very awkward
donation number but I appreciated that
thank you good sorry hope you guys like
my animations by the way yes that is
Crash Bandicoot and I don't have any
regrets of using them fresh bandicoot is
he's the thing right I grew up playing
Crash I loved Crash Bandicoot the
original was awesome three
and then the second one it kind of
tapered downhill just a little bit it
was okay but I really liked the first
one a lot I think most people agree the
first one is the best shade raid $2
donation my dude thank you love the
videos bro tato can't give much Rison -
I appreciate your donation anyway and
for watching thanks to all 221 of you
watching it means a lot to me really
does it you guys would take time out of
your Sunday nights and Monday mornings
to watch you know I don't I don't know
why you'd want to watch me of all the
other people you can be watching right
now that it means a lot and yeah we're
having a good time any clue if risin -
we'll have the same V core limitations
recommended V core okay so I really
can't talk about this stuff you guys
it's still under NDA you guys know how
this works the technical specifications
anything having to do with the CPU being
inserted in a socket and tested which v
core falls under the umbrella of I
cannot talk about right now so you will
hear all that from all the tech tubers
who have these samples on what is it 19
I think the 19th this is this Thursday
when the in days up I believe so you'll
hear all about them but I can't answer
rise in to specific questions like that
unless you want to talk about things
like the cooler or just like the
nomenclature or you know what's on the
box that's really about it I want to get
more rise in the samples in the future I
have more AMD samples I don't want to
ruin this thing so that's why I can't do
it
let's see Krypton accesing Lisa but as
but you're as good as it gets my dude
what's going on Krypton I could see
again let's see here we have one from
Killer phobia Greg if you were stuck on
a sinking ship would you rather have a
lifeboat would you rather have flex heal
like flex heal you mean flex seal make
the rubber thing that that's what they
use on the bottoms of the boats right in
the commercials cuz flex seals like a
magical no it's just some kind of weird
magical healing potion for breaks and
seals and whatnot it's actually pretty
funny now would I would stick with the
light but light bowed because you
actually have to have something with
which to spray the Flex seal I'm
assuming that's what you mean I don't
flex heal is I'm out of loop on that one
the greatness
Dola $0.99 thank you my dude for
shorting and for shorting me one penny I
hope you feel good about yourself I do
appreciate the donation power supply
needed for to 1080 T eyes and RAM amount
if you're gonna go all out on to 1080 P
eyes at least get 32 gigs of RAM just to
say you got 32 gigs that's what I would
do if you're gonna spend that much money
on to 1080 T is don't hold back anywhere
power supply wise depending on your CPU
choice let's say you got an 80 700 K
it's a pretty common choice for a gaming
CP or gaming PC power supply I would
choose would have to be around the 800
watt - at the house and watt range
that's well above what you would be
utilizing under full load let's say
we're running heav'n benchmark and like
I 264 you still wouldn't be approaching
800 watts under almost all circumstance
at 7 800 but for the most part gonna be
fine around that range and that's that's
usually what I would do for an SLI setup
that doesn't have a CPU that's a really
power hungry if you had like a 79 ATX a
year or something and you were
overclocking the heck out of it then
around a thousand Watts would be much
safer choice all right it's scrolling
down let's see will you talk about how
rice and chips require a less cooling
this is from Braden G our Brandon G
excuse me well you talk about how rise
and chips require less cooling and
include better stock cooler while Intel
chips throttle on budget builds okay so
I guess this is I almost feel like
you're kind of fading me here into doing
like this red vs. blue thing what I will
say in my experience recently I'm not
I'm not talking about risin 2 year or
second generation don't confuse that
with the new architecture well the new
lithography actually it is new
lithography kind of but it's so we have
Intel CPUs that have terrible Tim right
that thermal interface that's the the
stuff that they put between the die and
the H the heat spreader the IHS that
stuff's trash so if you replace that
with like a soldered on solution almost
like a liquid metal solution much lower
temps much more much more comparable to
what we get with risin risin does run
pretty cool in my experience with the
five and seven series and the first gen
and so I think that AMD definitely has
that going for it much much better than
bulldozer piledriver stuff right so the
79 around setting on the 8350 the 95 90
right which was just a freaking heating
element basically those were very power
hungry and at the same time they ran
extremely hot so they weren't very
efficient but the soldered on stuff that
we have now with Rison is really good at
getting that heat from the dye itself to
the IHS and then from the IHS to the
cooler also AMD packs better coolers
into their boxes especially with the new
stuff you guys saw the prism they called
the prism cooler with the 2700 X I was a
really cool cooler so you know they
they'd go out of their way to make sure
that if you want a cooling solution
included in the box it's gonna be
something worth using and not just the
trash Intel stock cooler we're just been
getting Cheaper by the way they've been
thinning the aluminum they took out the
copper slug about two years ago and I
pointed that out in a separate video so
yeah it uh III don't I don't mind saying
that I think it's the truth I think that
in most cases AMD chips are gonna run a
little cooler and you do get some pretty
sweet coolers included as well alright I
see a donation up here I'm gonna scroll
up a Ryan Shipley thank you for that $5
see ya I think he gave me five point
zero zero none of those four point nine
nine stuff I'm just gonna sound
entitlement on I don't doesn't make a
difference to me I appreciate all this
stuff I found a prebuilt for $1200 on
micro Center it has a gtx 1070 rise in
seven 1716 gigs of ram for do you guess
SD bearing it with a fire CUDA 2
terabyte what do you think I think
that's a really good that's a really
good PC depending on what you're
comfortable paying right with a graphics
card
if we assume like MSRP so let's assume
400 ish dollars for the 1070 another 300
for the 1700s which is actually little
overpaying right now but whatever let's
say at 700 bucks 16 gigs around another
$200 that's $900 you were already at 900
bucks just on the CPU graphics card in
RAM that's not including motherboard
power supply storage case right so
you're probably getting a pretty good
deal especially considering most
seventies right now we're gonna cost a
little more than 400 bucks doesn't sound
too bad all righty here I am gonna
scroll down scrolling down here
Salizar burns can you tell how you made
your old science studio intro like the
one in 1980 person I actually ripped
that I think I ripped it from my TripIt
I downloaded I have a mistake all
videoblocks I'm pretty sure I got it
from video blog so if it went from video
blocks it was from one of those like
third party places where you can
download interest I didn't make that
myself that would be pretty cool if I
did but I asked did not okay here a nick
de sousa thank you for the 5.00 much
appreciated love your channel learn how
to bend PE T G from you what is your
pick what excuse me what is your pick
for best mini ITX case for a high end
clean build this one's tough my favorite
ITX case I really like building in the
NZXT Manta
I'll stay that straight up that was
really fun just a creative looking case
you know it's just something
extraordinary right I'm getting the age
200 I soon from NZXT so that's another
one that to take you know to take notice
of we do have a couple of competitors
from leanly has that really cool one
they forget what it's called I know Kyle
did it build in it we have a couple
others from like fantex
but I think the NZXT right now it's got
a really solid grip on the ITX market so
that's why I went to them first to get
there to get this so I would say
depending on what I think about the edge
200 I that could potentially be my
favorite ITX case and that would knit
you know any build you put in that it's
gonna look really good if you know what
you're doing mark Gonzalez what's going
on mark you shorted me a penny I'm not
gonna hold it against you I appreciate
your donation have 16 gigs thirty-two
hundred megahertz in my gaming rig would
adding an extra 16 gigs be worth it for
more FPS absolutely not you would be
hard-pressed to even utilize 16 gigs of
ram in most titles I would leave it at
that
you know jump into 32 spanking I should
200 or so US dollars is not going to
give you an extra frame
almost I I'm like 99% of the time won't
make a difference and I've tested this
I've gone up to 32 gigs scaling from
which just won a gig damn even 1/4 gig
damn and 16 to 30 was literally
negligible so I wouldn't waste your time
there Eliot Beaumont
thank you for the $2 donation of my dude
a will ramp prices ever drop it what I
don't really know you know I really
don't know depends on how how things are
regulated right now in the market
they're allowed to do what they're doing
and yeah it's an extent they're shorting
the suppliant purpose so I mean this is
more of an ethical question more of a
social political question I'm just not
too sure yet I wish I could give you a
better answer but I'm not prepared to
guesstimate when that will be hopefully
soon I'm expecting by the time by this
time next year prices should be lower
especially with the new right there
they're working on the new architecture
so it's it's got to be soon it just
depends on how you know how soon that's
that's what's kind of you know worrisome
to me all right so we have a
notification from a will I want to give
you guys this is our Facebook group that
you all might be interested in yes I
just said y'all I'm sorry about that
actually know what I'm not sorry about
that I'm gonna copy it in the chat I
want you guys to click on this all right
because this would be a really cool way
for you guys to kind of communicate a
personal level and yes I will be in this
chat as well I'll be hanging out with
you guys there is the link I'm gonna
spam it like five times sorry guys I see
your questions there it is so click that
if you want to be a little more active
you know we have a patreon thing where
we communicate in discord I try to get
into that as much as I can because those
those guys are actually donating right
per month but if you don't wanna donate
you know I don't blame you you can just
hop into something like this and still
get a chance to communicate with me
one-on-one or link broken well the link
is broken Wow there you go
will spamming it now you guys see them
all right but yeah that's that's some
other way that you guys can get involved
if you feel like doing that I that would
be really cool of y'all to do something
like that anyway so the other thing I
wanted to bring up let's say there was
one more I think I missed
one more donation somewhere I don't feel
bad cuz oh I can't see it I can't see it
oh no I missed you guys I might let me
scroll down no I still can't see it I
feel bad because I saw the donation it
was five euros and I missed it
don't worry whoever did that don't
donate again off I'll get to in a second
he will if you're watching pull up the
donation that it was a five euro
donation I'm not sure who it was from
but pull it up for me if you can and
Link it to me so I'm sure to answer that
question let's see Rhys roasts Roesler
sorry if I mispronounced that he asks
what are the hardest classes when
studying engineering what should someone
know before studying engineering it's a
good question hardest stuff for me
really was dependent on my professors
you know you can you can take any class
in any curriculum you want and if you
have a great professor you'll probably
pass that's just out that's just how it
is especially in these kinds of programs
my toughest class the only class I ever
got a C in was thermodynamics and it's
because my professor talked about his
time at NASA 24/7 and never actually
focused on the material so when the
material actually came up in the test we
were relying on just the textbook which
was frankly trash and you know he'd ask
questions that had nothing to do with
most of our readings in those chapters
because he wanted to see how much would
you think outside the box and you'll get
ripped for that so your success is
largely dependent on the professor it
sounds like a cop-out but it's seriously
true I mean if your professor is cool
lenient willing to take the time to
teach you properly then you're not gonna
have a problem especially if you're you
know eager to learn and willing to put
in the time devotion all right Ben wit
Levesque ski says it's made on the same
authority if they make more GTD or okay
not used to furnace something else where
did I go to college
Ryan Shipley I went to the University of
Louisiana will the link is not working
again
rip Cody so luck I've seen you around
Cody especially on what is it Twitter
I've seen you before
college question do you think going to
college for two years an IT and getting
certifications is an OK way to go or do
you think I should go for a four-year it
really depends on your employer I'll
tell you what though a lot of
people now have 40 degrees and I'm not
saying that because because I'm trying
to justify what I did I'm just I did
what I did because I have to at least
keep up if you want to do some kind of
like technical field a lot of your
competition in terms of who wants your
job a lot of them will have degrees and
it sucks because you don't need a degree
to learn what you're gonna be using in
the field but that's just that's how the
world works you know and they say that
that's how it works you kind of got to
play the game so I first off I would say
check with your employer someone you're
you know a potential prospect I asked
them what they prefer if they prefer you
working sooner especially if you already
have something kind of lined up or if
they want that for you degree you kind
of got to do what they want right
because they're the one doing you the
solid by hiring you all right I am
scrolling up here rolling up scrolling
up scrolling up scrolling up why am I
not seeing the yeah all right pop em
papa 1.99 thank you for the donation my
dude what do I need for ABC Mouse max 8k
I feel like I should know what that is I
don't know what that is I'm very sorry I
hope you don't feel like you wasted two
dollars there excuse me
dollar ninety-nine you shorted me a
penny I'm definitely gonna point that
out all right we have issues what are
the issues with an AI Oh Vinnie I invite
you to watch my video talking about the
differences between an AI oh and a
cooler air cooler just watch the video I
literally uploaded it like two videos
ago so just go watch that it'll answer
your question let's see McCraw donated
five euro McCraw okay I'm gonna look for
McCraw McCraw if you're watching still
ask your question again cuz I definitely
saw that you donate eyes didn't I didn't
pick up your name and I didn't read the
question in time before I started
worrying about what will sent me so I'm
looking for McCraw and I will answer
your question I feel really bad that I
didn't get to it before it disappeared
mr. mee yo Gregg plan on doing any mods
to your Audi ever or do you like to keep
a nice stock car mister me already did a
couple mods I already modded the replace
the front grille or if you're talking
about the engine mods there's not much
you can do with a naturally
Freitas VA dude like they're sure I
could replace the airbox and that's
really it kind of tweak with the
throttle body I mean you can't do much
from that dry aspirated you know that
that's one of the reasons why I kind of
regret not buying the three Oh super
charge because then I could have done a
lot of stuff with it I could have a lot
more power out of it but I can't know so
I'm kind of just you know I'm kind of
just stuck with a v8 but I don't mind it
cuz the v8 sounds a bad-ass all right
scrolling down more with the C already
answered Cory
Vettel putting together a new bill
budget ish bill what's your opinion on
old Zeon's I seven or nine hundred
series GT X's or other older CPUs I mean
it's fine I've always condoned old
hardware can get it for a good price I
never said don't buy a little hardware
it's all about value right what you see
value is in those components you can get
a 900 series GPU for 100 to 200 bucks
depend on what it is like if you get a
960 for a hundred bucks maybe 100 bucks
100 bucks really that's a that's a
really good value you're getting good
performance there for around eighty two
hundred dollars and Zeon's i7s they're
fine
you know we're talking maybe if you go
back to like the oldest gen ICCP from
intel maybe a 20 to 25 percent FPS drop
that's still a really good you know
margin though especially when you're
paying a lot less for that you see piece
nothing wrong with the use nothing wrong
at all with that I'm looking for a mr.
I'm looking for the for the guys
donation
I feel bad he might have left he playing
him on a ragequit because I didn't
answer his question dang it will will
are you watching to find that find that
question for me is um I feel bad let's
see someone says turbo your s5 that
would be unwise
I could supercharge the v8 but that
would cost fourteen thousand dollars so
I'm not doing that because that 14 grand
I could buy a new car like that's just
stupid so I'm not and plus the
transmission you know the extra load on
the on the engine that's not rated for
that extra I think it's more I think
it's maybe more stressful in the engine
verses the extra air being thrown into
the block on the block is a champ that
Blanc is a tank
it's it's a very strong engine for what
it is
but doing anything aftermarket wise to
the block itself is just a little
sketchy Oh actually I see the donations
here maybe I'll be able to check pop in
okay I see you guys uh no no no never
mind I'm sorry Mark Gonzales McCraw I
see your chat McCraw you can thank
stream Labs for that he asks any idea
why my 1080 TI horas extreme fan has a
buzzing sound almost like coiled wine
when it spins speed doesn't matter no
buzz fans off there's no buzz when the
fans off and that's not coil wine you
know that's really strange I'm not sure
what that's about
you know if the fans are caught if you
know if your fans are not turning and
you still hear the buzz then it might be
coil wine if the fans aren't turning and
the blah and you know and you're not
putting stress on the card and it's
still whining then there's something
else going on that's really strange so I
can't really diagnose it unless I'm
there I gotta hear what it sounds like
but you could just got to narrow down
the different parts right the fans are
moving so I would test them first but
I'm sorry that's just really tough it's
difficult to diagnose that right now
scrolling to let's see here
Joe I'm good good teres I should know
this is Hispanic I don't know why I
don't know I think it's good tiras I'm
not sure sorry about that Joe thank you
for that $5.00 soup watch at can you
deal it'd current rise and chips and put
liquid metal no the reason why you can't
is because rise and IHS is are literally
soldered I'm almost certain on that I'm
pretty sure I haven't checked reason I'm
pretty sure they are there they're
soldered on which means that you already
have basically a metal solution a metal
contact between the the excuse made the
the dye itself right that little
reflective mirror and the IHS so no
point deleting cuz not gonna be any good
scrolling up again let's see here Tyler
Procter $5 super chat my dude got my 80
600 K and can get 5.3 gigahertz that's
incredible dude 1.3 six volts rockstar
you're gonna freakin die
right there but the p95 temps are close
to 94 see everything else temps are
great should I deal it'd yeah I mean if
you if you want to go for that high
overclock right that high frequency
already at five point three deleting
will just lower the temps that's
basically all the other thing we'll do
it might give you an extra hundred
megahertz or so overclocking Headroom
but five point three is incredible
already so yeah if you want to deal it
if you're comfortable with that sure it
sucks that we have to until should
already put you know decent stuff
between the IHS and the die but if you
want to go for it I mean you got a you
already got a diamond right now so you
can make it just polish it up man if you
deal it it you got even lower temps
there you go pop NIM pop donated that
one dollar ninety-nine cent he decided
to short me a penny but I'm not gonna
hold it against him ABC Mouse is my
favorite game benchmark with it ABC
Mouse really alright alright you double
donate and feel bad so I'll look it up
right here ABC Mouse it is hmm am I am I
being trolled here trolled I just got
trolled for a dollar 99 unless you're
being dead serious
but it's like you remember like
jumpstart like I used to do the
jumpstart games like jumpstart like jump
jump jump start first great jump oh any
of you guys remember that but I used to
play the game a lot when I was like 10
you know I was way past first grade but
I felt like playing it anyway because it
was really fun game anyway uh yeah if
you want benchmark with that you might
be getting some really high frame rate
resort donated a $5 through the super
chat thank you hey I love your YouTube
channel I just wanted to ask if you do
client builds I want a water-cooled PC
but I don't know how to do custom loops
thank you alright so I gave you guys a
little bit of an inside scoop here I you
do custom loop builds for clients I've
done if I haven't done a custom loop of
for client before but I've done builds
for clients with a iOS and whatnot just
an easier process so the conditions I
have for that the first thing is you got
to live close to me so get out of
somewhere in Florida where you're
willing to drive to come pick up and
drop off your parts that's the second
thing I'm not gonna ship the PC and I'm
not gonna buy the components before you
before you beforehand you got to bring
me the parts which is another reason why
you got to be in the vicinity
where I live and we can talk about that
if you're more serious in you know an
email or whatnot but that's those are
the first two steps and then the third
thing is you got a you know you got to
give me a little bit of creative lead
way because I know you're gonna want it
a certain way right that you the way the
pipes been and stuff I might run in a
personal issue so I can be I can you
know get things specific but not that
specific so give me a little bit of
creative lead way let me do it the way
that I think will look really good if
you trust me enough to build it for you
probably trust me enough to design it
the way that I feel like it should be
designed to look badass and then let me
go on from there but that's the first
thing you gotta be you know you got to
be in the sorry I'm scrolling down here
you got to be in the end of vicinity
prashant now I don't know why the audio
is not really fluctuating there's no
equalizer I have a Yamaha mixer here
it's a pretty beast mixer it's not that
it's because I'm moving further away
from the mic when I talk sometimes so
sorry about that just leave your volume
down and listen up I really can't do
anything else about that Hank Edgar says
dude I have a 3-way SLI with my GTX 10
atti
and I can't even run a VC Mouse with 800
by 600 I should do that as a troll one
time all right our benchmarking game
today is a PC Mouse mobile ball I'd be
pretty funny I'm tempted I really am
okay here we go Delta 9k with a 360 ml a
IO thank you for that $5 super Chad by
the way a 360 millio rad in the roof of
the fine r6 okay is there enough room
for Dom Platts above it just scrolled it
just scrolled I'm sorry about that
uh-oh scroll back down scroll back down
here is there enough room for Dom Platts
or have to use the lpx
you have the beam rings on the door okay
I would have to double check on that so
the man to really ask here is fractal
Josh I'm gonna actually here's what I'm
gonna do I'm gonna copy and paste your
your question and I'm gonna I'm gonna
tweet Josh fractal Josh and we're gonna
see what he says
because I'm not actually too sure about
that yo Josh question from a subscriber
oh wait that's the wrong I just copied
and pasted the wrong question sorry
about that
here we go okay
there we go tweeting it oh I just
tweeted him without actually like
putting his handle that was stupid
alright I'm gonna go back up here oh did
I even tweet it where did it go I don't
see my tweet oh there we go
probably should have tagged you there we
go boom
alright sweet so I'll let you know what
he says or you if you're following me on
Twitter I'll retweet his response or
something like that okay here sorry
folks
I am swinging back to the chat now just
going down to the bottom
that's the ma says fractal josh is busy
doing lines and doing C and doing lines
and doing 200 down Vegas and a 488 oh
that's good I'm pretty sure Tyler
Proctor thank you for that $2.00 super
chat my dude would you recommend a
silicon lottery deal it'd I mean yeah it
depends on how much more you pay for and
low charge of premium I don't blame him
for charging a premium just VC value in
that I'm not too sure if that's
something you'd be interested in paying
extra for I would say this though if I
was gonna if I was gonna spend let's say
300 bucks on a CPU and the max I knew I
could get out was like 5 gigahertz out
of the box in most cases if I knew I
could get an overclock like a bin one
that's deleted to like 5.3 gigahertz and
keep my temps relatively low like what
they would be with just the 5 gig run
out of the box then I would be willing
to pay like 60 to 80 bucks more for that
I don't know if I'd pay a couple hundred
dollars more but just kind of off the
top of my head that's what I think the
extra value is worth
maybe a hundred bucks max so that's
that's what I would do you know your
money is your money so whatever you see
value why isn't that but I'm pretty sure
that's a that's a decent proposition
Billy thank you for that $5.00 and one
cent donation he actually he didn't
short me a penny he supplemented one
penny for his donation I appreciate that
you're making up for some of these
people only donate dollar ninety-nine I
know what you guys are only get another
one from pop in pop into a dollar
ninety-nine donation I'm just kidding
what's up yo overclocked in 77 okay what
is GT else LLC I have LLC on but not
sure about GT LLC and the corresponding
voltage modes you I'm not sure I've
never heard of GT LLC that sounds like a
question for Steve and gamers Nexus off
to see if I can do some research if I
don't find an answer to that question I
will I'll tweet at him I'll message him
and see what he says I've never I've
never touched GTL else you know what LLC
is I've never touched GTL LC so I'm not
too sure trying to think about GT what
kind of calibration GT at load line
calibration I don't really know Grand
Touring load line calibration that's
exactly what I mean I'm just kidding I'm
not sure I'll try to find out for you
Daniel Grizz - Bo ray I think if that -
a pound is that two pounds two pound
donation hey you're your currency strong
two pounds is like three bucks thank you
for that what do you think of these
Intel 8086 K rumors never heard of an
8080 6k I've never heard it so I don't
know exactly what to say I feel I feel
sorry about that I I mean I'm sorry that
I can't answer that question by the way
guys if y'all are if you're gonna spam
in the chat please don't do that I will
put you on timeout yes I roll with an
iron fist please don't spam it's no fair
to anyone else who's like trying to just
legit ask a question once I'm not gonna
get to everybody I probably get to most
of you understand so maybe you're asking
questions I thank you for those
questions I'm trying to get the super
chats because I feel really bad for them
because I don't them to pay and not get
what they want so I'm trying to get
trying to get through these first and
then I will move on mister me think that
dolla $0.23 donation interesting
donation but nonetheless thank you for
that pop in
Nym pop that one dollar ninety-nine cent
one penny donation short my friend had a
10 K PC budget for an ABC PC Mouse or
ABC Mouse PC even be running that thing
like 20,000 frames per second so more
power to them
alright here I see thanks will for the
moderation thank you for that sir
suppose weights scrolling oh it's
supposed to be an anniversary edition
8700 k chip okay I've never heard of
that I have not heard of that obviously
it's not a big enough room for me to
hear about it unless it's almost I'm
living under a rock and I might be I
don't know let's see Jacob viv I missed
it Jacob
vo men where would you get your hardware
when you first started on YouTube would
you exclusively work with what you could
purchase out of pocket yes so Jacob so
what I did actually I bought PC parts
with my own money not about a $500
budget starting out before I even had a
channel I built a PC filmed it put it up
on the channel and then eventually I
sold that PC for like five hundred fifty
bucks something like that I put like a
little you know $50 premium or whatever
on it and then I bought a different PC
with with a little bit more money that I
had I kept working my way up I built 10
pcs and sold all 10 of them for maybe
100 or profit apiece and eventually I
had enough money to pretty much buy
whatever I needed you know that wasn't
like too over-the-top and then that
basically moved into me just getting
parts sent from companies once the
channel got big enough and now I don't
have to buy too much I still buy stuff
like I buy SSDs every now and then I
bought a cooler just recently you know I
still buy stuff if I need it right away
cuz sometimes it takes a while for these
companies to send stuff from the
warehouses and document and all that
stuff so it's just it's easier sometimes
to buy out of pocket but that was how I
started so you know if you're interested
in how to do it
let's see Tyler Proctor said oh no I'm
so sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry I'm
scrolling down I missed one from
coalition gaming thank you for that a
tree fitty donation that stupid chat to
three-fitty tree fitty not 350 I'm sorry
about that tree fitty from collation
gaming and cola habit with gamers Nexus
Steve for a science of shampoo video I
tell you what
[Laughter]
if I see you Steve it Computex if Steve
goes to Taiwan again this year I'm
pretty sure he is I'm gonna find the guy
if I remember this I'm gonna find him
then really Steve please please let's
film a minute science video on shampoo
and let's use your hair it'll just be
like we won't even show like we can just
like have it be like on the DL like we
won't show his face like we're just show
like the like hit his hair like his just
wavy strands of hair you know with like
the shampoo just rolling down and just
been all soaked up and stuff get some
slow-mo shots in there just me like just
stroking his scalp like getting the soap
in there and then yeah then you pan out
and it's like oh it's gamers next to
Steve like that would be the coolest
thing ever
but of course anyone watching this live
stream or whoever sees if that part
share it or whatever they would know
that that was what I was doing that's my
dad give me a second here hey what's up
yeah hey sorry I'm I'm in the middle of
a livestream can I call you back okay
sorry alright thanks sorry that was my
dad um I don't want to keep you guys
waiting we have school stuff to worry
about because I am actually finishing up
my last four classes and my master's and
then I'm finished it's really weird it's
really cool though but anyway yeah
that'd be a really really fun thing to
do with Steve I would totally do that
like I'd be totally down for it anyway
Tyler Proctor thank you for that $2
donation 86 under K do it for $45
conduct and not plus tools is more okay
the deal it's 45 bucks what about the
bend eighty six hundred K that's what
I'm curious about you guys hop on over
to Silicon Lottery and see see what
those prices are like Bob's everything
for that two dollar super chat my dude
would you do a updated version of
painting PC parts yeah I'm actually I
see I see
minun minun me at monster mini me at
monster I see your question I'm I get to
your car question the second I used to
paint PC parts a lot because not many
components were you know they didn't
come in white but nowadays it's like
companies kind of picked up on that like
the whole white trend right wanting
parts that reflect RGB colors much
better than black parts do and so I
excuse me I think that um because
companies caught on to this pretty quick
after I started doing it and I wasn't
the first one to do it but after about a
year of doing that they started rolling
out more white components we have a
white cases more often now I think we
have white graphics cards that are more
common other than just like the Galax
cards white RAM white motherboards right
this stuff like this wasn't mainstream
five or ten years ago there was one or
two exceptions but it's more mainstream
now so I don't really see the need and
painting stuff because I could just kind
of work around some parts that aren't
white to find those ones that are I mean
that's better than painting trust me
unless you're like an expert painter the
finishes on these things are much better
than than a custom paint job
okay Here I am scrolling I see a mini-me
mini-me at Monster oh god I just I just
like really mess this up there it is car
question not computers opinion on 60s to
70s American muscle cars favorite
favorites what you hate I know you got a
nice car yourself I'm personally a fan
of the older stuff
problem with that my favorite 60s to 70s
car would be a 67 probably a 67 stingray
big-block yeah we're talking like 454
horsepower big-block before you get my
thing like I'm talking the king of
Corvette Stingray's in the year 1967
that's Mike that's the cream of the crop
from the 60s era is that car in my
opinion what I don't like I don't really
like the really boxy muscle cars I
really don't see the 70s the kind of
where I just started tapering off for me
I didn't really like that design choice
a lot of the muscle cars here weren't
that great
I do like late 80s Early 90s stuff you
know JDM I like supras and SX is I like
those you know kind of curvy sporty
looking body styles and I also like the
the only boxy cars I really like or like
the Ferrari Testarossa they're like the
512 TR I think those look really cool
they just they look different than
anything else on the road so that's
probably the closest I would ever get to
like a muscle style 60s or 70s era car
the Testarossa is like late 80s early
90s but you get the point
let's see here slow slow mo shekel berg
you should talk about Nvidia versus AMD
GPUs on different CPUs and how AM you
GPS have less reliance on the CPU due to
having complex part of our scheduler
versus invidious simplified scheduler
okay so that's actually more complex and
you make it seem and you make it out to
be it's not just about the scheduler it
really has to do with optimization from
from a developer standpoint on the
gaming side as well because some games
do run better on AMD GPUs and it's not
because of the scheduler it's because of
how things are utilized on the developer
side right how things are scripted how
those commands and I order themselves
when frames are being drawn so a lot of
that's frankly beyond me at this point
I'll try to read up more on it but it's
it's not just black and white like that
it's it's really not doesn't mean that
Nvidia graphics cards are suddenly
superior on all levels to ambi graphics
cards that's not how it works so that's
why I haven't talked about it because
it's not it's not a clear and cut answer
it really depends on the game it depends
on the platform and it depends on the
CPU it's paired with that's a lot of
testing my friend maybe one of these
days that's all
testing maybe something for maybe from
maybe something first steve from
hardware in box to do because that's
that's gonna be like a hundred plus
benchmarks let's see here scrolling down
i see ok coalition gaming i see you that
still working on small youtube channel a
small youtube channel review series
yes coalition game and still working on
that look I have a couple I've already
finished but I want more than just to I
don't want it to be like it just an
exclusive highlight like I'm trying to
just like pump two channels and I want
to have a bit more diversity in the
video so I'm still looking for that now
and once I figure out the channels I'm
gonna pick for that series it's more or
less gonna come down to what videos I
select to showcase like you know little
clips of them while I'm talking about
the channels and kind of giving little
clips that you guys can hear so you get
an idea of what those channels offer
stuff like that so eventually I'll get
to it but right now I only have two
channels up on that video and it's
already like 8 minutes long so it's
gonna take a while ok ok ok ok ok
coalition game I see it alright Spencer
Carruth careth Carruth oh no sorry about
that
have you ever messed around with Linux
would you ever consider build building a
dedicated Linux system no I would not
Atlantic's is not my thing I've played
with Linux before I've installed Linux
on Chromebooks I forget what what Linux
it was it was a while back it was
like 2 or 3 years ago anyway in my very
lightweight experience with Linux I
don't like how complicated it is I
really don't like you know the user
interface mmm matters a lot like the
simplicity of it it's why iOS Mac OS are
so popular they have their disadvantage
it's nothing wrong but it's also why
windows is pretty common because it's
easy to use Linux is not for most people
it's just not there's a huge learning
curve with Linux so that's why it hasn't
taken taken whole that's a lot of
programmers a lot of developers use
Linux there's a good reason for it
because they can get around the software
and it does benefit you and a lot of
those content creation not content
but a lot of those programming needs but
from just a plain old consumer
standpoint Linux is not ideal it's just
not
scrolling down some more let's see yeah
let's see ok poppin em pop mute I muted
no I didn't mute you that was probably
we'll just blame we'll pop him pop and
that was definitely will sexes you can
change the UI in Linux yeah I know you
can change the UI but I still don't like
the way I don't like how complex it is I
really don't it's what it's way more
complicated just to navigate through
Linux than it is to navigate through
even Windows maybe not Windows 8 Windows
8 was stupid but Windows 7 Windows XP
even Windows 10 to an extent in my
opinion much easier let's see there's
scrolling through ali-a I see again I
can't afford the r60 on metal TG and I
would like to know if laminated glass
would look would have a better acoustic
reduction would have better be Kristen
Kristen reduction properties than TG I
have no idea if that's a very specific
question you have to google that I don't
want to answer cuz I'm not sure there's
a scratched IHS or Die effect if you
have a scratch die you probably got a
bigger problem than just temperatures
affect thermals of a chip scratch my
5820k
up ages ago using the abrasive pad from
cool laboratory when using their liquid
ultra and I'm curious if it made a
difference probably not you know as long
as like it might to a very small degree
depends on how big those scratches are
but if they're really small scratches
long is that the solution you have in
between the Tim right if using liquid
metal or something else as long as it's
making proper contact inside those
scratches because the scratches are
basically little canyons right in the in
the metal from a Microsoft microscopic
standpoint then you would probably be
okay as long as you got proper contact
and big scratches though mmm I would
doubt that it would still be functioning
properly scrolling down here cirebon
says any Triple A games I have 100 FPS
after messing with all settings I'd
really like that 144 do you think
horizon 3 will cut it or maybe next gen
Intel I got 1600 and gtx 980ti so far a
1,600 retirement like a risin 5 1600
then why are you asking about risin 3
because that's risin 5 if you're talking
about risin 5 then yeah it should handle
higher framerate yeah rather than 5 will
handle you know as long as your settings
aren't overbearing on the CPU side and
you're not doing it's you know an insane
amount of TAS in the background then
risin 5 should be perfectly fine for
most of that just off the top of my head
few games obviously not gonna get that
unless you drop some settings that's
just how it's gonna be but in a relative
sense yeah you can play you can you can
game it 100 FPS plus will arise in 5 CPU
best Intel CPU hmm I'm not sure yet I'm
gonna test the 8400 here soon and then
after I test that one I'll let you know
what the best one is but I got a feeling
that's gonna be a pretty sweet bargain
scrolling down yes see we have here
three through Bennie
been B I don't know how you want me to
say your name but anyway yeah I think
the 8400 is a better proposition just
from looking at the spec sheet off the
check though I'm pretty sure you know
you get those six solid cores there for
what two hundred bucks you know like
that's a really sweet value now from
ambe's perspective right you get
multi-threading support on a similarly
priced chip so it really comes down to
what you do if you just game the 84 one
is probably the better bet but if you do
gaming multitasking any kind of thing in
the background like streaming live
streaming like this you'd benefit from
Rison 5 so there are several scenarios
to consider scrolling down do you feel
like GPU prices will be going down soon
they already start to creep back down
you know just gotta check every day I
can't tell you I don't follow the market
like that and a micro sense but I'm
pretty sure they're gonna be sliding
down here soon
and they already have begun to do that
they're not thousands of dollars like
they used to be Vic Victor s22 thank you
for that $7 at $0.49 New Zealand
donation my dude appreciate the super
chat greetings from a New Zealand
question I have arise in 1700 and I'm
wanting to get an AI o is the h ati okay
i also want overclocked at 4 gigahertz
is that possible depends on your
motherboard in most cases with ABI be
350 board you'll get around 3.9 - for it
you might be limited more less by your
CPU don't really depends on the chip you
have but with the H ATI I think you'll
be ok with the overclock it rises and
doesn't run too hot we were talking
about this earlier it really doesn't run
too hot so I'm pretty sure you will be
ok with an H ATI
any kind of a IO that's decent and you
have a you know adequately supply fan
curve applied then you'll be okay let's
see here scrolling down GPUs are still
well above MSRP oh yeah they're above
MSRP but if I'm saying is they're not as
bad as they used to be
trust me they're nowhere near as bad as
they used to be let's see okay Josh
replied to this this is actually really
cool so a fractal Josh replied to this
tweet he the question again was 360 m la
IO and on the roof of the define r6 is
there enough room for Dom plats
or do you have to use lpx right which is
the low profile Ram so he says trying to
decipher your message lol I do not know
the exact height of Dom Platts but I
have a standard 360 rad plus 25 thick
venturus in the top of my r6 and they
clear g-scale try and see if that helps
so it sounds as though it'll it'll work
it sounds pretty says pretty much like
you're not gonna have a problem not
certain but it sounds like you'll have
space there and Josh Johnson works for
the company I'm pretty sure he would
know he's talking about so I would take
his word for it at least for a G skill
check
dimensions the differences between
Triton's Iran and Dom Platts which I
think Don pies are a little taller to
make sure but it sounds like it'll be
okay
it's the yeah okay all right I see Jose
Salas
for a first time custom look should I
used PE TG or acrylic so I've never
acted I've used acrylic once and
actually in didn't even going that
didn't even go into a build I just I had
a crew like I had him sent acrylic and I
used it to kind of see it's easier to
bend I will say that like it heats up
quicker and it's easier to bend but at
the same time it's it I just don't like
acrylic I really don't I didn't like my
experience with bending it I didn't like
how fragile it was ptg you can bend the
crap out of it and it probably won't
snap unless you're doing something
really weird but ptg is more forgiving
in that sense it is stronger it will
bend a bit more it will cut easier you
don't have to use one of those shaping
tools for like you do with acrylic you
can just take a freaking hacksaw and cut
through ptg and it probably won't split
this because of the nature of ptg
chemical profile so that's why I've
always used ptg and that's what I would
recommend you start with some people
would disagree I know my friend Tony
Tony supplies up with all those custom
cables virility PC customs he prefers
acrylic and I mean I can kind of see why
but at the same time I just I'm not as
comfortable with it and he feels the
same about ptg so you know agree to
disagree
scrolling to troll like trolling ttan
mmm should I read it should I read his
chance okay well I'm gonna assume he's
not a troll despite what his name says
does the new horizon 2700 X come with
onboard graphics the 2700 X oh I don't
think it does I don't believe it does
I've taught my head I'm pretty sure
doesn't because Rison one didn't so I'm
sure someone else in the chat will
answer but I'm pretty sure it doesn't
his horizon one didn't so it would make
sense Brinson M McBride chicken tender
pub subs tossed in honey mustard or
buffalo buffalo because I don't like
honey mustard
sorry excuse me let's see shin gives get
go zebra
sounds like Godzilla remember the guy in
the one with the Matthew Broderick right
the Godzilla movie and that the guy in
the beginning was like oh he was trying
to see the head like the lighter
hospitals I've seen that movie you know
looking back though the effects in that
movie weren't that bad they really
weren't for being what it was like circa
2002 or something I don't remember for
sure but anyway it was uh
that's what your name reminds me of I'm
gonna screw up your name again I'm sorry
I missed your question I was so hung up
on how cool your last name is isn't is a
15 I'm a CI five is an AI 580 600k okay
for video editing and 16 gigs around 16
gigs around for sure is enough for most
video edits let's doing some really
heavy stuff and you're using a ton of
stuff dumped in system Ram 16 kick
should be enough the 86 under K is a
fine editor again you know that the i7
is gonna be the better choice but the 86
under K is still very good for what it
is
six cores is plenty premier if you're
gonna use the way premiere at one for
sure leverages frequency over the red
account in most situations unless you're
like it to threads so a six enter case
fine if you have an 86 hundred K already
and you want a video put it on it you
won't have a problem with it but if
you're choosing between that and i7 try
to squeak out the extra dough for the i7
it will make a difference
let's see demon king Loki are you gonna
stream PC building simulator I actually
have a I have a key for that I haven't
cashed in yet I just thought it was a
little funny because like okay it's a
custom PC simulator but then you have to
use a PC to play the simulator so if
you're gonna I don't know maybe it's
like an instructional tool you could use
it for something like that but just
thought it was kind of ironic that if
you want to learn how to build pcs in a
simulator you would have to use a PC to
play the game anyway I'm just nitpicking
there
let's see k5 sm k PT bench ha bhenchod
whatever y'all's names are weird and
dropping in to say I love the channel
man
thanks for dropping by I appreciate that
all of you guys watching by the way 305
people thank you guys for sticking
around do my best to get to these
questions I understand you know if
you're frustrated haven't answered it
yet I'm sorry please don't spam the chat
I'll get to as many as I can
we're gonna stay here for maybe five two
more minutes and then I'm gonna head out
because really they're supposed to be an
hour long and this is a lot of talking
to do at one time but I also have
schoolwork to get to after this would be
okay Brandon what's your favorite game
Crash Bandicoot if there wasn't already
obvious
let's see rx 580 black screens is from
Lloyd Williams 22 in his rx5 'ti black
screens while gaming it's getting 1.5 5
volts which seems high so I'm gonna try
under volting it with a with a 7 degree
target temperature yeah I mean you can
under fall 5 eighties affair a healthy
amount it depends on the AIP or if it's
even in a IV but it's you can under fold
it to buy pretty good amount we can
under bolt the stock for ATS - so worth
shot that's what I would say I mean it's
it's worth a shot
Shin Gojira thank you for the $10
donation dude I appreciate that you
didn't have to do that I don't even
think you donated my answered your
question but thanks for sticking around
I hope you I don't know I love your name
dude go zero that's really cool
Technol have you ever considered doing a
modern-day review of the 10 year
anniversary for the Q 6600 or the now 10
year old ASUS Maximus extreme green LGA
775
so I've done a build with the Q 6600
it's a 350 dollar bill I did for Bo his
his channel i-ight Bojangles and he he
really liked it he was actually you know
he was okay with it in the beginning he
realized that it was you know he felt
that the age of the platform he laid at
950 and there's eventually he upgraded
it was a good intro PC for only $350 and
the Q 600 was actually pretty good for
what it was we didn't have a clock at
too much I think we got to like three
point four I think it was like three
point four or three point five gigahertz
I might be totally wrong about that but
we have a clog that you know it's one of
those like ancient BIOS is right like a
legit BIOS not a UEFI or it's a blue
screen but we tried our best so I might
revisit that at some point I'll have to
get a hold of excuse
six-hundred though if he still has it
see if I can borrow it from him for a
few did to test with it
okay scrolling game master GPP I talked
about this in the last livestream a
little bit my feelings towards GPP are I
feel like NVIDIA is gonna kind of end up
shooting themselves in the foot a little
bit I feel like from the consumer
standpoint people are just gonna you
never know you have a lot of loyal fans
out there who are gonna forgive any
company for anything if they're loyal to
the company but I feel like this is a
poor choice on a videos part not because
it's not gonna be beneficial for them
financially because I think it will be I
think it's a smart play on their part
but at the same time I think it's gonna
be detrimental from a community
standpoint so it's a double-edged sword
whether or not they weigh one over the
other I would be surprised if they weigh
the financial one more so we'll see but
more news coming out every day regarding
that and Vidya is responding to all of
the criticism they've received from it
thus far although a few people seem to
be okay with it so I don't know I'm kind
of neutral I those kinds of things you
know honestly like the way I see it like
if a company screws up and does
something like this and we don't agree
with it right we think it's immoral or
illegal and it's not necessarily to an
extent right a company that has a
monopoly or takes advantage of other
companies as an oligopoly or a cartel
those companies should be intervene
there should should be intervened by the
government I don't usually like it when
the government steps in and messes stuff
up it's oftentimes what they do but and
this is more of a this ventures into
politics and subjectivity but I tend to
keep the government out of things like
that as much as I can but then when it
comes to taking advantage of other
companies and consumers that's when I
think they should step that's that's the
fine line for me is this an is this a
case like that I don't think so
I really don't I don't see NVIDIA
dominating a market with this tactic
especially if we believe that it is
referring to just specific like lineups
of graphics cards they're not telling
the entire company of EVGA that they can
only do stuff with Nvidia those
companies already have agreements right
like something like P&amp;amp;Y only does stuff
with Nvidia they don't do stuff with AMD
that already exists XFX right with AMD
those kinds of companies only work with
set manufacturers because they already
have agreement so no one complain about
those before
if nvidia wants to incentivize companies
fine it is it gonna shoot them in the
foot I don't know maybe some people are
more sensitive that kind of stuff than
others but that's all I'm really gonna
say about GPP I don't to make a
dedicated video on it you know stirring
up controversy and stuff and spouting my
opinion all over everybody I I just
don't I don't think there's much to talk
about in the way of Science and
Technology from that it's more of a
social thing I talked about net
neutrality one other thing those were
the couple of political discussions we
had on the channel but for the most part
I I don't like diving the topics like
that because they're so controversial
here oh I see it it's the scythe Mugen
five rev be as good as the dark Rock Pro
four I'm not sure I actually though
speaking of scythe had just bought the
low profile cooler we're gonna do a
really cool build and the fractal no -
OH - we're gonna do a case modding I've
been talking with fractal Josh about it
and they're on board for a sweet haste
mod series so we're gonna build a really
cool ITX PC in a modded - OH - you're
good you'll you'll get more Diesel's in
that later but I'm really excited for
that
you look dope Chris Shaba is thinking
for the $5 supe chat thanks or excuse me
thoughts on the new horas x4 70
motherboards will you be reviewing it
soon also when is the quad still are
built coming out I can't speak to the x4
seventy boards right now I'm just kind
of I'm gonna generally not discuss stuff
like this until the NDA for AMD is up so
I'll have to get back to you on that
later you'll hear my reviews on the
motherboard when I actually run my tests
the quad stellar build not sure if will
is still watching will needs to come
pick up his stupid quad still it's not a
stupid case but his quad seller case is
huge and it's sitting up and sitting in
my garage taking up so much space I can
really park in there I mean it's gonna
pick it up so we can actually build the
build so eventually we'll get to that
but yeah sorry - your first question I
can't answer that right now not yet very
soon though and you were here my
comments on those boards I'll talk to
him I'll talk about them in the horizon
to horizon second gen videos Alex w
thank you for that $5 Subash at my dude
I have an i5 KB the H 7500 NZXT Kraken
AI
oh ma eighty xh2 seventy but motherboard
eight gigs of ram and a ten seventy
where do I line up in the gaming front
I'd call that pretty mid-range that's
not bad you get the 1070 that's a great
mid-range card it's a it's a little on
the high end of mid-range
that's looking you know with respect to
Maxwell it's 90 DTI territory that was
upper end Maxwell that's attending the
1070 right now it's kind of from the
upper middle it's one of the top three
or four cards that are consumer grade
cards from Nvidia right now and that's
not including Vegas stuff on an AMD side
so you're on the upper end of upper end
of the middle I don't wanna say you're
on the high end because you got you got
that locked i-5 that's a cable a guy
five I'm only eight gigs of RAM but from
a graphics card standpoint you not doing
too bad scrolling down more here let's
see some right Hot Chili Peppers just
came into my head that's weird
kind of sounded like the singer method
that Tom Bauer's thinking for that $5.00
I'll see what's five dollars Aussie it's
like I know else currencies
I don't know Yost currency goes up and
down a lot compared our so I'm not sure
what that is but thank you for you
donation I appreciate that question my
1050 TI has recently been stuttering my
every install drivers four times and
it's running cool is GeForce experience
to blame I don't want to jump the gun
and say it's g-force that's that's iffy
I would pull up MSI Afterburner
check a GPU utilization see if it's
fluctuating a lot sometimes there might
be something with windows itself can
like interfering with the software and I
found that just doing a clean install
which I know is a really crappy way to
recommend fixing your PC but often times
a fresh windows install will fix that
issue if you stop the issue then it's a
hardware issue because then you've
completely eliminated the software cause
right for the most part unless you have
conflicting drivers update as much as
you can try to rollback drivers that's
another option you're gonna be
troubleshooting all night I'm sorry
about that but those are the things I
would do just kind of off the top of my
head some quick ways to diagnose it or
at least narrow down your you know your
possibilities let's see scrolling
scrolling scrolling
okay
I am scrolling favorite brand for
computer tech Alcatraz Foxtrot not too
sure what do you mean brand like Justin
like what kind of tech though you gotta
be more specific than that I got a new
Jessie s I have a horizon five sixteen
hundred whenever I try to overclock my
RAM over twenty six sixty-six my system
reboots and resets the stock frequency
yes sir that is uh that's rising one for
you ram compatibility it's tricky
because the Infinity fabric is linked to
ram frequency and that can cut you know
that can cause some really serious
instabilities I found the 2666 is about
as high as I can get on some older
biases update your BIOS for ufi on your
motherboard now I'm get that updated and
then try again if you're still getting
those resets it's just gonna be your RAM
you can tweak with castle agencies and
timings but it's gonna be I don't know
if it's gonna be worth worth the you
know the trouble they're messing with
Ram timings it's just it's a real big
pain uh what games would you recommend
for a laptop ma says Jesse need higher
volts I don't know if you yeah I'm
assuming you already ruled out the
voltage issue I'm pretty sure if you
already know how to overclock you know
that adding more voltage would give you
that lead way but it also increased
temps right so I'm not sure if you want
to I'm pretty sure he already knew that
but he might not so I'm glad you said it
backlight will be selling my thirty ten
70s for three hundred each next month
from my old mining setup in India Wow
what do you guys think about buying used
graphics cards that were used for mining
specifically also I'm curious to know
whoever that was just said that if
you're going to disclose that you use
these for mining a lot of people won't
even disclose that or they'll say like
only used once or some BS like if they
ever say something like that like 99% of
the time they're lying they've used it
more than that that or you know they
they got it from a friend or something
and they decided they don't need anymore
cause I have something better those are
a few exceptions but you know I for the
most part yeah say that's that's kind of
anyway
scrolling down scrolling down here 10 DS
forward you daddy from we've a $10
donation on the super chat and I did you
didn't even ask questions you should
have asked a question but I appreciate
the love I really do and I appreciate
the donation you know how to do that
thank you
to flow bar to 760 from a friend and
every time I try to play a game and
other crashes freezes or something else
I have a 1080 on the way but it's gonna
take two weeks wait for your 1080 TI
that's the way you're in a diagnose that
you'll know if it's the graphics card if
the 1080 TI doesn't result in those
crashes point blank so I can't help you
until you you bench you know I tell you
narrow down your variables I have
troubleshooting vids on on the channel
you can check those out too they will
help you but troubleshooting over
livestream is not not gonna happen
Martin Thompson next time you do a
Craigslist video are you gonna are you
going to make sure to block out people's
personal info so Martin the way that
it's done in Craigslist your phone
numbers already blocked I don't
recommend anybody put their personal
address on Craigslist that is stupid
that is totally stupid okay and I'm
pretty sure that the last guy who I the
the last guys video that I did I did on
Craigslist
he had an address up there that was it
though his his number is hidden so cell
phone numbers are hidden by default on
Craigslist unless you go out of your way
to make it in obscure right so the
Craigslist doesn't like I try to hide it
I don't like I don't like people do that
Craigslist used to block phone numbers
but they don't anymore so I don't know
why people still do that but I try my
best not to reveal phone numbers
addresses though I don't touch those
like if you're dumb enough to put your
address on Craigslist you know there's
no there's no I can do about that I'm
not gonna go through and blur it every
single time I try to go through each one
of these ads for that one video where I
did the one ad perfectly fine I'll you
know his address was in his address that
was his business address so you know
there was no there was no issue with
copyright there the video didn't get
taken down he he did flag it but it
didn't get taken no they didn't violate
YouTube's Terms of Service so that's
what I have to say about that
you know if he's dumb enough to put his
frickin personal address on Craigslist
that's just survival of the fittest like
don't be don't be stupid and I'm not
gonna you know I'm not gonna try to
censor every ad that I show when you
post a Craigslist ad you post as minimal
info as possible but enough info to
where they can contact you without
finding you and hunting you down and
stealing your stuff that's how you
operate on sites like Craigslist so
putting your personal address I just
have I have I haven't ever I have no
sympathy for people who are that dumb
and I'm sorry you guys might not agree
with that but I just I don't feel like
dealing with that crap door Meister are
you going to rename the channel back to
Salazar no I will not I don't think I
ever well this is this channels gonna
say science studio add this it just
keeps me on track
it really does I changed name originally
because I thought we were gonna venture
away from science and do all kinds of
things that some stuff had nothing to do
with science but it would still be OK to
do on the channel but you guys subscribe
for tech you really did and so if I
venture from that you guys are like hey
you even if I post a car video some of
you just dislike it cuz a car video and
I post like one every two months you
know so like you guys are really some of
you are unforgiving but I write in a way
I respect that because your your bluntly
telling me I don't like it stick on the
you know stick to the the straight and
narrow path and that's why I went back
to science to do in a nutshell scrolling
down here James G hey quick question
2600 X and an ml 240 la IO or 2700 with
a stock cooler the 2700 I don't know you
could go with a 2700 X and the stock
cooler that would be dope because that's
not cool or that prism cooler I'm gonna
test that soon but that thing looks
pretty sweet so we'll see what the
overclocking potential is in the stock
cooler
no but you might just want to go with
that cuz didn't get a cooler included
anyway depending on how far you want to
overclock but again you know okay a
couple more questions and I got head out
of here my throat is killing me
let's see scrolling down frenzy clan
what games would you recommend for a
laptop with an i3 70 100 you in an Intel
HD 620 like The Sims 4 Wes
if the Alamo you run sims 4 on that any
honest you might get away with like dota
2 maybe probably not unless you really
dumb down some settings that's a really
restrictive platform and on top of that
you got like an ultra-low power i3 plus
Intel integrated graphics not ideal okay
one more question
one more question should I get a 1000
watt Platinum power supply
I don't know greatness I don't know what
you what your specs are so I can't
answer that question I have no idea in
most cases you don't need that much
Marcel oh one more question how long
will the gtx 1070 TI last me when I only
game at 1080p I'm sure it will ask you
several years I have no doubt you'll be
comfortable with that you might not want
a game it just 1080p though and you
might not want to game it your your
refresh rate so if you go 1080p I would
go for like the highest refresh rate
possible in 1080p and be comfortable
with that because 1080p looks good from
like two feet away and at the same time
yeah that refresh rate your graphics
card is need to be hindered by the
resolution and you can keep upgrading
CPUs or platforms to stay within your
within your buffer zone I saw I saw one
more donation here let's see we have a
super chat from a moving frag think for
that $10 my dude last time I asked you
about the way to sell pieces to sell PC
now my first one got sold on Craigslist
so thank you awesome he did it right see
if you guys price it conservatively you
know you can bump the price up from what
you paid by 50 or 100 bucks but that's
usually what I would do stay within like
10 percent of the total build cost is
what I would do for a markup on it on a
PC you build he says one more to go
question have you tried to build the
dual CPU systems i tinkered with one a
while back and I don't think they're
worth it I don't think many people are
gonna even know what they are and most
of those motherboards are really
expensive and at the same time they look
weird and they're they just look weird
they're not consumer grade platforms and
though they usually like workstation
platforms so I probably wouldn't do that
for resellable build alright folks I'm
gonna call it quits I am my throat is
gone but I appreciate you guys watching
I'm sorry for those we who are asking
questions and that I didn't get to I
will try my best again come back next
week every Sunday at around 9 p.m.
Central Time
10 p.m. Eastern
you know 9:00 p.m. central is like what
9:00 p.m. is 16 4:00 a.m. in Europe I'm
sorry to my European friends who were
sleeping there that time I get it
I can't stream at the same time for
everybody you know from like just a
objective like numeral standpoint
everyone's gonna have different time
zones so but I appreciate those who are
watching and we'll be back here next
week ask your questions again write them
down so you don't forget if you want to
stop by again next week try it again
I will try my best to ask or to answer
as many questions as I can thanks again
for the super chats the donations from
you guys if you guys want to support us
on patreon maybe you can ask a question
in patreon itself excuse me if you want
to do that I think like you'd only got
to pay like a buck a month or something
they get access to the discord channel
and I'm in discord every day I try to
pop in discord and see what's going on
with a chat and answer questions anyone
has anything like that so tag me and
discord if you have a question if you
want to support us on patreon that's a
way to do that it's linked in the
description and then again you can just
wait until next week if you really want
to ask live thank you guys for watching
and this is after hours
number eight we're working our way to
biggle number 1010 after our streams
it's pretty awesome this will be a
hopefully a recurring thing now Creech
you guys watching we uh I said that like
six times I appreciate all of you
watching we're gonna end the stream now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
