of being an Intel fanboy I present to
you a custom cooled Rison PC build I
hope you enjoy what is up everyone this
is my second custom lead PC build ever
on the channel but I think things you
can go by much more smoothly this time
around I'm much more familiar with PT G
tubing how to bend all that should be
able to get this done in a day or two I
don't have much going on in school right
now so i'ma try and knock this out as
quick as possible I will run through all
of the gear but the first thing I do
want to say in case you haven't already
been able to tell this is all sponsored
by thermal tape thermal takes sent all
this and I wanted to make an effort to
do a thermal take custom loop build
because I feel like a few of you were
pretty harsh with how you just
automatically defaulted to you know this
is a bad company they don't make it
products you can't trust them with
custom loop gear period I find that to
be a bunch of malarkey I've worked with
Thermaltake stuff in the past and you
know apart from that one hiccup with the
C 1000 coolant which I couldn't show you
a clip of right now oh yeah you see oh
that a you know that gunk in there apart
from that thermal take is a very viable
custom lead PC brand and after this
build I do hope you will reconsider if
you had a few harsh words to say
beforehand so this is just a matter of
proving a point you can use this this
company and not have any issues for the
most part we're going to go through
every nook and cranny here and try to
build inside of the p400s tempered glass
Edition I reviewed this a few videos ago
check it out right here and then I also
will be including the gigabyte a X 370
k7 gaming I mixed up those what in
whatever words but yeah this is a
gigabytes best AM for board of course
the rise in 1700 X already installed and
then I have a surprise but for now we're
going to using a gtx 1070 for our
graphics card that will be water-cooled
so we're going to take off the ACX
cooler on there but we'll be replacing
that with something else very soon I'm
sure you already know what it is but
this point but we'll also be custom
cooling that and I think the plan is to
fit a 360 up front which you can do
there is room we've removed the basement
door so we have room for a 360 going all
the way up and then we're going to put
it 120
tiny little 1:20 here it's kind of weird
so small right in the back right there
but that's the plan these are just 30
mil thick I believe 25 mil thick
radiators and we should have plenty of
room for for everything we want now
because we're only using one graphics
card I thought it'd be pretty cool to
try out the old Tony method here and
install the reservoir like that so we
can mount it to the basement and then we
can run of course our radiators or fans
will run the tubing down and then we
have a d5 pump that massive thing back
there it's going to be tucked away in
the basement nicely you do have a few
extra things to include a drain port
which is something that blue sky does
not have currently I do highly recommend
one and that should be it I don't expect
we'll have many hiccups because of the
case is very custom loop friendly but I
think the most time-consuming thing of
course will be the ptg tube bending
let's see how much we get done in a
matter of a few hours
you
you
you
you
you
you
okay we're at the point now where I'm
going to start seriously considering
where I want to run the tubes we've got
quite a number of ports but they're all
over the place
in the case here so we've got a 360 up
top the two ports for the CPU block
another two for the 120 rad and then
we've got two right here at the base
reservoir this is a fill port by the way
so we're going to rotate the case up you
know did the front side down and then
you'll fill it up from that little drain
valve there the fill valve and then
we're going to have a pump here and the
pumps going to have an in in and out and
then we're also going to use another out
for or drain valve or drain port so
we've got quite a number of things going
on here and I'm not entirely sure how
we're going to be running this also keep
in mind we have the graphics card I
haven't actually done that yet but
that'll be another two ports to worry
about so there's going to be tubing
running all over the place in this case
but I think it's actually going to work
out fairly well because it's going to
fill up all this empty space there's
still so much space left in the p400s
and that's kind of surprising but it is
very roomy in here
you
well I do hope you enjoyed the build log
process the PC is not behind you right
now because I'm working on a few things
if you notice there were some flashing
fans in there that weren't calibrated
properly software wasn't working so I
had to swap those out and I'm also in
the process of cleaning up just a tiny
little leak you'll also hear about that
in part 2 which would be the upgrade
video will replace the 1070 with a 1080
Ti as well as replace the stock red
cables from Corsair with some custom
sleeved ones from Tony at virility his
