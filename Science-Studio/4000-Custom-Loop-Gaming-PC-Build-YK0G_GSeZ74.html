here inside the arrow cool p7c one pro a
very very large case like I talked about
in that review and it uses actually very
similar design to many other cases at
least on the interior the exterior
though air pulls done a bit to change
things up including adding the RGB
integration and an excellent airflow
setup here with the three included RGB
fans
I let the tempered-glass side panel on
to show you that it's not very tinted
that's a pet peeve of mine some people
like the dark tint because I can only
see the LEDs inside but I kind of find
that defeats the purpose you want to
show off all of your bill not just the
LEDs and whatnot so I'm really glad that
this has a very slight tint to it and it
is on right now like I said it's
reflective a bit but you can still see
most of stuff inside just throw an LED
strip up top like I did now and
everything should be very visible I will
talk about specs here I didn't mention
too much what was going on in this build
in the review video while I had just the
parts laying in here without the tubing
so I have first off two gtx 1080s just
plain old 1080s in there running an SLI
these are just reference PCBs I have a
gigabyte horas gaming 7z 370 motherboard
with an i7 8700 K all of the custom loop
gear that you see in here with the
exception of the CPU block and the
graphics card water blocks is from primo
chill so the radiators that are painted
white buy them at their factory you can
get them custom colored whatever you
want basically all of this is done at
primo chill and the paint job is very
sturdy it's not gonna just chip away
with the slightest scratch of your
fingernail you'd probably take a pickaxe
this thing to be honest to get the paint
to start chipping off so I love the
white I'm glad that I got white fir for
this build in particular also the
revolver fittings the best fittings on
the market as far as I'm aware there's
no fitting better than these fittings
when it comes to just the ease of use
and how reliable they really are the
tubing is PE TG it's just my tubing of
choice I find that it's the easiest to
work with the most forgiving it's not
going to shatter like acrylic and it's
not too expensive either going with like
hardline glass or maybe copper would
maybe give it just more sex appeal but
it's gonna require
or work you're not gonna get these
beautiful bends that you're seen in here
especially with that s that s is just
like I'm really glad I threw that there
kind of like a last minute thing but I
really think it makes the build pop
perhaps the most noteworthy feature of
this bill is of course the s this was a
single Bend it only took me one try but
one of the issues I had was not having
enough tubing lengths to make it to the
back of the CPU block see I use a little
coupler here to connect a very small
piece of tubing that was kind of
downward to the S bend and this goes all
the way up to the 240 mil rad so I think
that Ben is the the most prominent in
this build and it definitely going to
stand out once we fill this thing with
fluid speaking of which let's get to
that right now
and s you know S stands for science so
there's that now that's for filling and
draining this loop it's gonna be a pain
as most of my loops are I don't really
find the utility and planning out a
super complex drain system I just I
really don't think that it's necessary
just flip your case a few times you can
get most of the fluid out and then start
tearing your custom loop apart piece by
piece to get the rest of the fluid out
just be careful with you know which way
you've got openings and tubing's leaning
and you should be fine that'sthat's how
I've done it since I started building
custom loop pcs so the drain port just
sticks straight out of the reservoir
here on the right side just unscrew the
cap and most of it and the resin to
towards kind of funnel down thanks to
gravity the rest of it will have to be
drained either by flipping the case or
taking it apart piece by piece but that
shouldn't be too much of a problem
filling it was also kind of a pain
because the reservoir is lower than the
highest point in the loop so you just
kind of have to work with it you got to
fill it all the way at the top and then
turn the PC on or at least turn the pump
on let that fluid start circulating that
level and the rest will lower then you
can add more fluid and then you cap it
off and then when you turn the PC off
all that fluid will kind of equalize and
settle out most of the air gets stuck in
the rad but most of the air is gone
which is a good thing it wasn't like
that in the last custom loop build I had
I do want to say one thing about the
fluid in here this is premature opaque
white fluid it was combined with
distilled water from their factories
it's just old water it doesn't really
matter where you get it from and then
also I added a treater to it you could
use a piece of silver or they have
algaecide drops you can add to a loop
depending on how much fluid you have in
the system overall there's quite a bit
of float in here because there are two
two radiators not just one also two
graphics card blocks so things things
can get pretty heavy when it comes to
fluid treating and what not having to
flush things out every two or three
months which is probably the bare
minimum amount of times you'd want to do
that a year especially with opaque fluid
should be okay course none of my custom
loops last for longer than maybe a few
weeks so we'll see how long this one
lasts before I decided to tear it down
as for staining and whatnot this this
fluid in particular I have not noticed
any staining at all even on the PTU
tubing which is pretty rare for opaque
fluids and I'm very satisfied with that
pretty much chill Opaques or what I
would recommend right now so that's
about it if you liked this video be sure
let me know about giving this one a
thumbs up I do appreciate that also if
you just like the bill itself let me
know by giving this one a thumbs up
that'd be super cool of you I'll leave a
comment down below suggestions for
future videos future builds like these
we have a super cool custom we build
coming up in the dark based Pro 900
white edition also I'll be reviewing the
NZXT H 700 I yeah that's in the studio
it's in the hallway actually so that
will be a video coming up here soon stay
tuned for all of that content good stuff
on the way this is science studio thanks
for building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
