he won't 220 now I told him that that
not gonna happen I'm gonna go find
another deal and it was just like he's
like no man 250 I'm like 220 any telling
me that you know what's going on here
yeah I couldn't find out what happened
join in there's no deal oh that was that
was a gorgeous if we're peaking by the
way folks let us know I will adjust
things I'm not as audio savvy
it's like Freddy Brian here I'm just
gonna balance myself yeah I'm literally
screen capping his his camera so Greg we
gotta sorted we gotta sorted after hours
chat Greg got his stuff sorted yeah I
got it was the cat that bit the cable I
didn't know the cat that the cat five
bro that's and my Wi-Fi works through
I'm streaming right now like 4500
kilobits on Wi-Fi because my wired
connection was trashed but it's all
coming from the same modem so I don't
know what's going on with that it's like
you said it's got to be a cable or might
be my switch but I don't know the switch
is just that's just there so I don't
understand cat damage the cable dude um
I've added the falls yeah that sucks cuz
I like stuff these cables underneath the
carpet so it's gonna be a pain to pull
back up anyway this is a ask us anything
livestream you guys know how these work
if you've been to science studio before
we answer any question that we think is
worth answering and if we have time we
will get to as many as possible so if
you got a question you don't have to
even even pertain to tech you don't want
it to be although I recommend that you
do keep it in tech because that's
usually what we're good at talking about
you can go ahead and ask in a chat and
we are both watching it we're watching
it like hawks so give us your cues and
we'll give you the A's that was really
bad said that's really what's good man
good people want you to do the bogan
accent now because I started off with
that real strong eater down all right
here's a good question I'll doing the
bow in an accent yeah okay so the good
guy here wants to know I've always had a
question bro how tall are you
I've got to say I am not too tall I'm
about how do you say it in our seats
meters right I don't know meters no we
use that we use the American might fire
I'm 510 so yeah I've got five nine five
time think Brian's like a little hair
taller than I am but with tall shoes on
and we're pretty much equal so I make
sure to wear tall shades and I'm around
Brian anyway go okay I'm done with that
I wear nice dude oh very nice
I wear nice ooh yeah actually I bought
my last pair in Taiwan now yeah oh good
a nice man they're good shoes oh yeah I
don't go with anything else because like
I started buying these other brands in
the past and the soles come away from
the shoe and it's so frustrating then
she yeah this is they're cheap they just
glue them together and they hope that
they last long enough and most people
are telling that was a British accent
I'm sorry I was it does sound good looks
like Matt there Matthew likes your Jar
Jar cops amen Cheers
yeah for the win something Lenny like a
prop like that that I can lean on that's
so cool
yes baby well you know the critics of
one two and three they sort of have gone
into the shadows now after seven and
eight been released and they're now
people are praising charge are they like
damn if that was as bad as it got bring
it back okay with me man I've never had
a problem Joe Jon how would you feel
about them having like a full-on
dedicated video to Jar Jar like they are
is it for real oh no my build will be
Joe Jon I'm sorry but mom know if they
actually do for movie on George
I would watch that the solo one I don't
care like they've been stretching out
the Star Wars trilogy
into what six series and then they
stretched it even more now recently it's
just come on yeah no not really my cup
of tea
what's a good Andy processor to purchase
right now Blayne whichever one you think
fits the bill in terms of price if you
think 200 bucks is all you want to spend
on a CPU then you get 1600 2600 I
recommend staying second generalist you
can get a 7 series
first-gen for dirt cheap which every now
and then he might get lucky okay Michael
yeah Michael fire Highlander his really
is wrote a massive post I'd have to like
read through it and then I'll give me
the answer it's it's huge
yeah we'll continue the show and I'll
give you an answer sorry man
so yeah what's the what's the question
is about sorry as well I'm gonna balance
all this out oh I thought you were gonna
answer the question right now oh it's
gonna take like a couple of minutes to
raise he's been these follows us on
Twitter and he's constantly active in
the comments and stuff you know I seen
the discord server - I hope so
discord link is in the description so if
you guys aren't in the discord server
it's free you don't got to pay a single
dime and you guys can chat with us one
on one let's see here Kevin I am running
a 35 70 K okay with eight gigs of ram
and 660 i have noticed it's starting to
have issues running newer games do I
need to upgrade well I think you
answered your own question there if you
notice does have an issue is probably a
sign you need to upgrade if you're
asking what you need to upgrade what do
you think 3035 70s not that I would say
upgrade the graphics card first right or
do you think you should upgrade
platforms and just call it a day
I love great platforms at the moment
then wait till those cheap cards come up
the sale okay yeah they're gonna be ng
man I just mark my words imma getting
cheap it said not gonna give you getting
cheap I'll grow an 80s rock haircut
mmm so it doesn't matter I'm probably
gonna grow one anyway what is it people
asking for blood type I feel like that's
like an inside joke that I'm not aware
of
dude I'm o-negative man that rare one
that you hear about I'm like that one o
negative it's the universal donor that's
rare isn't it like 5% or Weitzel's oh
maybe I thought it was like 70 something
percent it might be there between
negative and positive I think I'm like a
be something weird
Krystal yes you do you pull them off and
then you can reflash them with SPI flash
aw that's how you if they're locked you
flash them that way so there are
people doing you know the craziest thing
I saw on the discord last night be 150
motherboard 8400 working with ddr3
memory are you kidding me
super budget motherboard ddr3 and 8400
that is like got my appeal and my
curiosity really struck for budget for
my value for money because you can pick
up beef it v1 fifties really like the
thing is you have to be out of Peugeot
you have to get the one with the one
that you can pull out the bass chip
whisk it's gonna be life's gonna be much
easier you can get the jaws and wasted
time from aliexpress putting the jaws on
and reprogramming it but I'm not that
level yet so I mean I usually recommend
stuff I can do like yeah I can do the
jewels stuff yet man that's Leslie and
then people like dude solder off solder
off the chip and then reprogram it and
so I'm like dude whoa no no I'm not
going there man have you seen how bad my
solder already if I try to put a
soldering iron on the board I'd
literally put a hole in it and then be a
trace gone yes yes what do you do
actually for a daily job I pretty much
do this this in school yeah man
difficult on dude but you know with all
the like just all the little bits here
and there like I dude use a soul I do
the videos do the Adsense people
supporting us on patreon it yeah I get
by man it's it's fun um no I guess it's
it was tough like you know and I started
off just when I go back to Australia it
was tough now it's sort of getting okay
I am working a lot longer hours than a
typical job but it's still you know get
by and I love doing this yeah it's
really it's really as good you know you
here's whinging about YouTube and stuff
and like the actual platform sometimes
but the actual job itself is amazing
getting to be your boss is like if you
can like I know leave me personally if
the degrees I've got and I know I could
probably find a job that would
eventually pay more than I get
now like I don't get paid very much now
I think at some point I want to just do
a full-on like disclosure of how much I
make a year they'd be like people think
we make hundreds of thousands of dollars
and it would be surprised to find out
how much less we actually do make than
that
but yeah it's it's just something that I
enjoy doing
more than I dislike the money because
it's it's not like we make tons of money
here we just do it because it's getting
to be your own boss is really fun
no no one yells at you by the way I see
my cousin cousin Katelyn I see in the
chat how's it going what are you doing
up it while you're in Eastern time
that's 2:30 a.m. uh Tech yes city you
all see you just got called out by
trihard rice yeah I'm a nosy four so
stop doing just dem down there we got
this different oh I just you know
it's not bad dude where I live man
that's like that's like common place
that's not bad
Matthew asks what our audio setups are
like so we have he's asking about if
it's USB or XLR so my index L are I know
Brian's is - Brian's audio games better
than mine I just have one with impress
off b1 I got the be one with high
pressur and I put the shield on to drop
the treble just a little bit it like
people say it sounds amazing especially
for the money I spent on this one this
is a mic that costs not even a hundred
dollars a good press it costs you know
20 bucks in Japan I mean since then they
have gone up a lot in value people
understand how good those rolling the 25
ax interfaces are and yeah like it's
it's really so good for the money the
compressor really fattens up your voice
and gives you that sort of easy
listening feel if you're under listening
end and you just tuned in what have you
doing with the afk or you just doing
something else you can tune into the
show and just really easy on your ears
really want to get a good compressor and
that's the you a 25 X I think it's
called
it's just a goldmine of an audio
interface and I told like companies like
creative and stuff I said you guys want
to sell your audio interfaces put a
compressor on board use that's what the
average streamer would definitely want
and I don't see many people doing that
I'll and uh thanks again dude I'm yeah
I'm almost through
post Greg you gotta take over for a
little bit okay sorry ah so I see oh
yeah by the way I'm using a b2 right now
now I don't sound as crisp as Brian does
because I'm much further away from my
mic than he is I tend to use it more or
less just for like a it's not a studio
vocational mic it's just more of like a
convenience mic in that sense there's
because I when I film regular videos I
use these as well I live one on a stand
back there eventually though when I get
into my own place I want to have a mic
that drops down from the ceiling like a
professional
and then it'll sound much better let's
see do either of you have a fix for
getting 5.1 speakers to work under
windows 10 dude I've had that issue I
know exactly what you're going through
it sucks I know like the only way to get
around that really is to like try to
trick it into 5.1 by changing the
effects on your sounds tab and that's a
pain because then the music sounds like
trash yeah trying to get true 5.1 is a
royal pain really all you're gonna have
a stereo with the exception of gameplay
and like certain games that actually
push 5.1 because I'm pretty sure Windows
10 like native audio push through the
operating system is stereo I don't think
it natively splits and that's really the
root of the issue
so yeah that's 5.1 logic z what's the Z
906 is it that's beautiful sound system
I was gonna say yeah you have to have
any stroll interface for that I like a
sound card
yeah like coming out of your motherboard
I mean I don't know I feel like like
when you have a motherboard that says oh
a 7.1 capable but then you have an
operating system that prevents you from
running seven point like true seven
point one right yeah I say z9o six
minutes like be king for a home and a
game on it's so good man interns this
place here into like a nightclub and it
doesn't even break the bank goes like
300 Ozzie or something man such a good
sound system for the money logitech just
nail it I just read through Michaels
postman
thanks so much dude almost brought me to
tears on livestream
he's basically a vet and he just a
preheat just loves the content I do
around the channel man that's it thanks
dude like Michael you're the kind of
viewer
I love men you pretty you just love the
content it's what I do is unique and
it's different and I love doing it not
just because it's different this is what
I love doing I love bringing restored
potatoes up I love doing that of course
just doing that on my channel it's not
profitable not that profitable so I do
do the new stuff I do mix it in and it's
just so good like he was saying as well
as our course at Steve at hardware unbox
thought we were knots so I last year I
thought Intel was snappier this was gone
back last year I said this stuff about
the snappiness and hey Steve said it was
all in my head I was just you know he
actually got pretty angry at me and you
know and Michael agreed he said dude
you're right there's something different
you know you can feel it and he said
he's the most snappy of CPUs felt is the
6700 K overclocked really high and
that's yeah that's because it's four
cores eight threads it's actually will
be lower latency than a six core eight
threaded six core 12 thread and an eight
core the upcoming ain't call from Intel
so yeah the less cause the more even
more snappy it's gonna be I personally
haven't noticed the difference when for
corn six core on the Intel side that's
getting to really really intense levels
of difference but it's there you know a
nice Eddie's came from the he's he he
agrees the 2700 X is different to the
1700 X he can feel that difference and
it's crazy it's he agrees and it's like
that snappiness thing that I've been
talking about it's there he's after an X
7940 reckons it's impossible to get it
in the u.s. so X 79 is really hard to
get in the US are they yeah it's like
overpriced man like 300 bucks for yeah
and the reason is is because they're
like you get this is what I mean I'm
getting I'm doing it I'm not gonna give
it away too much but yeah I'm doing
something with ax 79 and there's a big
reason for that I'm gonna do a couple of
videos YX 79 still popular and that's
mainly because the ddr3 and it's a so
it's just yeah there's a few different
things going on but at the other day
guys if you enjoyed like the different
content we do then just thanks so
just thanks for watching the you know
we've got the options there to go
sponsor and support us in patron but the
end of the day yeah we just do this
because we love it and I teamed up with
Greg
especially after tech deals dropped off
without even just saying anything at all
which I thought was pretty rude just
yeah I mean Greg sort of picked up the
pieces and I've met with Greg in the
past these are real stand-up dude and
that's sort of for me just like getting
relationships just having like you know
Michael understands what I'm about and
I'm sure if me and Michael went out in
real life would be like just be as man
and straight-talking tech he'd be you
know to me the person always goes before
the business I don't know and if I don't
work with people on the personal side I
won't work with them in business either
it's weird thing man some people are the
other way around and that's that's who
you are
yeah they can keep personal stuff
separate and then that's how they roll
right so they're gonna be complete jerks
right and the business side because
they're cutthroat they're rude to
everybody because they're only worried
about getting ahead and then you have
you know the other side of this guy when
he's back home with his family with his
friends you know whatever and he sees
two different people and some people I
don't know to me like to be able to
separate it like that you've got to be
almost psychopathic like you've got a
you've got to be able to just like turn
it on and off and I just I I don't I
don't know how to do that I don't know
if I would even want to do that if I
could because it would just be using an
overwhelming you will never understand
it either you can't put yourself in
someone else's head right right his
brains are wired up differently
especially from when we grow up from a
young age everything we do like Bali our
brains develop as well due to
environmental factors like you know
people who play the violin get a notch
on their brain did you know that like
yeah apparently people who play like the
piano and violin it's when they get like
a notch on their brain and Einstein had
that notch as well so isn't that weird
it's just like so many weird things in
science that happen so well yeah I knew
this question would come up Cola tech
says what out between you and a hardware
unbox I'm not gonna talk about it
publicly so if you want answers you can
ask Steve that's up to him to answer for
you but yeah we just don't really talk
anymore I mean
I respect him I love his work I love his
channel but yeah I mean good on him good
luck to him but what happens this
it's probably nothing really in the
grand scheme of things but I took it
pretty personal so anyway with a let's
see question from heated gamer I wanna
know what you think about this - Brian
that's fine Studios should I get a rise
in seven 1,700 with a beat fifty
motherboard and 16 gigs of ram or a 2600
with X 470 and 8 gigs of ram so this is
like back to what we were talking about
right so in in Brian's live stream you
guys it's gonna be archived probably by
now so if you want to watch that I
recommend you do because we talked about
this to an extent Brian and I were
debating the viability of risin 1 vs.
risin - if the risin 7 Series was priced
much cheaper then 2nd gen Rises and I
find this to be a perfect perfect place
to talk about it because you guys can
ask us whatever you want about this
stuff and I think this will lead to more
questions from you guys but Brian and I
can both attest to the snappiness and
the improvements all across the board
right from from rising to s perspective
especially when it comes to ramp timings
frequency it's just X and P profile you
can enable it right away and it's just
it's a goal with horizon 1 I could never
do that every motherboard I had any BIOS
I had any Ram kit i used i could never
enable X and P and I hate that because I
can just do it on Intel and it's no big
deal right because but the ring bus is
separate right from memory frequency and
the Infinity fabric isn't and that's one
of the big reasons why it's it's
stubborn but the question is if you can
get rise in 7 1700 for 200 bucks or
horizon 7 or excuse me or the second gen
risin 5 2600 for the same price which
one should you get and in my eyes I see
the extra cores is more beneficial in
the long run Brian how do you see it I
see it depends on the software man like
and do Adobe is I'm locked on Adobe dude
I can't change like I try change saying
I'm too used to it and guys like you and
me we're just we're strapped for time I
don't have time to go out and learn a
new platform for editing videos I just
don't have time so for me is like Adobe
Premiere Pro and I'm locked into their
service they've got me on my knees can't
do anything
so for me it's like if they optimize it
for more cause more threads and
especially Photoshop and other things I
mean I'd be keen but like I said I'd
like I said to you behind the scenes I
think that eight calls 16 threaded Intel
chip coming up is going to be really
good it's gonna be a little bit extra of
what already works really well so that's
that is that this you been you gotta
expect them to charge what for 450 for
that right cuz they're charging 350 for
the 6 core and they're charging 250 for
the four core excuse me they're charging
250 for the 6 core traditional bit of
charge 250 for the four core but no
charge if they charge full 50 for that
unless should be pretty good
I yeah but when seen in the context of
the 2700 X I really don't think spending
a hundred and fifty ish dollars more
plus potentially a new motherboard right
to get the overclock so you should
expect from me exactly 2700 X is good
good
yeah I'm just not seeing like if they
priced the a core I what they already
priced the 8700 K I think you've got
serious kind I think that would be Intel
just sticking it back to Andy saying
okay we can produce an 8 core CPU - and
you know what we can price it around the
price that you're price in your 8 core
oh but the difference is you can
overclock are as much higher like that
Mac Deidra he said any plans to visit
the US again of course to be honest you
know me I'm a deal I'm gonna be honest
with the audience I'm a deal hunter I'm
gonna wait until there's some event I
get sponsored to go there you know
double down as a holiday and I'll do use
brass pots pots hunting everything I do
in life is a deal minute sadly I go down
to the store and I get deals on sausage
rolls when they just sort of closing
down the shop bang you know 5 sausage
rolls for 5 bucks
it's Hustle is in my blood in my life
that's it's like everything I do is a
hustle I even had one guy today on
gumtree like call me and a hole because
I knocked back his offer like it was
pretty bad the guys like messages mean
y'all want to trade in my x58 board I
want to trade in 6 gigabytes of ddr3 and
then in a 99 and 990 X
Intel CPU and I just message back yeah
I'll give you a hundred eighty
Australian for it and he's like Oh
day you sort of thing blah blah blah I'm
like dude that's what I would get all
that gear for I'd get a next 58
motherboard for around 100 bucks I
picked up one for $80 a P 60 got a six
core 12 threaded you can get that off
Aliexpress X 56 75 amazing Xeon like $50
and then 60 cubits of ddr2 it's three
it's nothing it's like yeah that's about
what I'd trade in and my pcs on gumtree
are priced really well you go out and
find another guy bringing better value
to the table to use pcs they won't so
that's why I mean I'm hustling for deals
but I'm passing on those deals to people
who buy my pcs I don't care it's just
it's fun I love doing the content as
long as the content you keep flowing
from that that's what it's all about and
yeah and I mean you you have as as a
seller you have that power right I mean
in a sense you can kind of discriminate
who you sell to because you know those
people are gonna be loyal in the long
run right so I don't yeah the way I see
and I talked about this in my crisis
video the most recently I post it was
like you know if you're a seller and you
have a certain price you want to sell
something at like that's your bottom
dollar right obviously don't want to put
that as your bottom dollar publicly you
just have it in the back here head and
you price it a little higher on that on
the ad but the buyer wanted to get the
thing from you as cheap as possible so
he has a maximum price he's gonna pay
for it you have a minimum price you're
willing to let it go for and you got to
find the middle ground but by no means
should the seller be offended if
somebody low balls
you know if somebody low balls a seller
unless it's ridiculous and you just
messing with you
but the seller shouldn't you know this
same it goes both ways that's what I'm
trying to say like there's it's just
mutual if you disagree just move on
don't waste time yeah I'm gonna go me
man I point out he's hip-hop I just
literally I replied pointing out he's
hip-hop Chrissie's and then I asked him
a question who's the a-hole
you know I mean like ya know whatever
man it's good to be honest sometimes I
do get a kick out of getting into
arguments where you know not a no oh
yeah yeah yeah sometimes you wait there
pointing out who pointing pointing out
he'll forgive me hypocrisy czar really
it's fun it's satisfying it's a
satisfying feeling sadly but I mean
being on both sides of that I mean like
I've been on both sides or you have to
like just like knowing what it feels
like I think that's why we know it's so
satisfying because if it happens to you
then you're like okay well if I can do
it again as somebody else cuz you're
gonna be more cautious about it right
you learn from it so also we got a Scola
tax actually a pretty good question does
it really mean anything when Intel and
AMD drop support for older operating
systems like Windows 7 for it to a gamer
it means a lot it means that they got
paid pretty well Intel and AMD got paid
from Microsoft quite well that's what it
means and then it's it's news that goes
unnoticed I notice it behind the scenes
because I do work with that kind of
thing well you know you go to
commutation you go to the parties and
you see this all these things happening
behind the scenes where even MSI company
like MSI get paid millions from
Microsoft to to push this to push their
software so there's a lot that goes on
behind the scenes the average person
doesn't really hear about but yeah AMD
and Intel dropping support for Windows 7
just means they got paid that's all
means yeah I agree
always and like there's no other reason
why they would I may ask yourself why
else would they have done that right
what's the motivation that they have
morning money is the motivation yes I
mean we're right now at this very point
when I just pointed out that argument
whereas the AMD fanboys that say no I
mean a.m. do you want to do that they
care about us they love me
aim D cooks my breakfast how dare they
drive they wouldn't drop in Windows 7
support and get paid for it no they
would they're publicly the company of
course they would so it's just yeah
that's like the biggest thing I have at
the moment is I did it I do I do like
really objective videos and the last one
I copped a bit of flack when I did the
1000 fps analysis people just saying I
don't buy some dist and that it's just
from AMD fanboys I seem to have a
problem with it but when I recommend AMD
stuff people who Aaron tell families
don't care
yeah I would say there's a there's a
chunk of the AMD families it's pretty
radical I mean anything that's anti AMD
or anything that recommends Intel
basically that's the only other
alternative for consumer pcs at this
point is just anti-consumer right that's
like they're always the the shout out
like oh you don't want competition you
know you've just been milking that Intel
money I guess is what they like I'm not
never been paid up and dying from I only
have Intel contact like I don't like
either I have a and B contacts believe
it or not but I don't have Intel contact
so if my propensity is to keep my people
that give me CPUs happy which actually
is an Intel it's a distributor it's a
company that works on behalf of Intel or
AMD excuse me you know then that would
be my motive but it's you know it's just
a little petty to assume that uh so hard
they tell us we're drinking is that on
the weekend you know what I try but I
haven't tried before and JD and ginger
ale and it was so good it's no I tried
it I tried it and it was just it was
pretty good dude I ain't gonna lie man
it was smooth it's like the two blended
to make this just really good mix uh-huh
I mean drink it a bit more allowed
Daniels like it's just it's got such a
strong taste already well you don't like
JT I don't the last time last time I had
JT was when we were in we were in the
Corsair party last year and you gave him
and you gave me a drink and it was like
some of it was like right there next to
the bar you gave it to me and I wasn't
it was dark I was like okay it's
probably Jackie knows it was one of
those I just had to kind of chug through
it because you know like I just I hate
the taste not the alcohol it's just the
taste of the drink overall it's just to
rock on oh yeah dude that the first
context I went to I got that was bad
name one of the videos I was like
limping because my
was that saw dude oh that yeah you know
it was bad that was the first copy text
second one I did you know refrain
because I didn't want to you know have
that experience again yeah see what
products you got and in this film and
I'm like grabbing my live off yeah yeah
that was something that I ran in the
fall on the show floor this year and we
talked for a couple minutes and he said
yeah he goes I'm trying to cut back on
the parties and just keep it business
and I was like dude like straight up man
like that's that's what I want to be I
aspire to I think everyone this she
turned it down yeah I noticed many like
I don't know there there weren't as many
like party parties you know they were
only formal like course there always has
that like formal like elegant dinner and
a few other like the crucial party was
the same way you know it was just kind
of like chilled out more professional
and I feel like that's kind of like the
thing they're trying to go for now it
looks better from a PR standpoint right
to have a elegant kind of party that
serves like you know wine and champagne
versus JD and ginger aioli people's
people say you need to get Dollar Shave
Club as a sponsor should you send him an
eight man I would give you them close-up
macro shots of just oh I had a clean
shave man opinions on Trump's space
falls what is that yes it's like an it's
like a legit thing I mean I watched his
speech and without getting too political
here like I feel like he was being
serious about it so that he wants a
full-on space force man like space
Federation you know so we're gonna have
space cadets like real ones no I mean
look he's a yeah I think he's turning I
think he's turning the naysayers away my
guys remember we talking about ages ago
and before your even your election
started he was the you know
out of all the candidates he seemed to
have the economy down pat and that's the
most important thing but you know he's
done some real dodgy stuff in his
personal life sure but yeah I mean it
looks like he's doing a good gait the
news here in Australia has shut up about
him completely you don't hear him on the
news anymore it's in in Europe and when
he first got when he first got in it was
just trash talk Trump he let I just
turned the TV off I'm like give the guy
a chance man the people voted him in
America give the guy a chance at least
and yeah it looks like he's doing good
men son James as if we're gangsters I I
one misfiring dude aspiring gangster any
[Laughter]
$39 PC build depends I would go 1,300
bucks I would try to squeeze in like a
horizon 520 616 gigs you can get 16 gigs
do you notice that 16 gigs of ram now
has dropped at least in the states it's
actually used to be around 200-250
you can get for about 150 160 now so I
mean at least the guy's a gaming PC or
just a PC what are we doing that's what
I'm saying yeah but anyway yeah have the
RAM prices going down in Australia oh
really
I'm still getting fleeced I mean the
retail is gonna be the place and that as
long as I can like I think every I think
the RAM thing it goes pretty deep man I
think it's not just Samsung crucial no I
fix it it's it's but they control 95
nothing a lot of people were jumping on
the train and and fleecing that crap you
know there was a um but yeah 1300 gaming
PC it'd be like for me I'd be 8400 GTX
1086 think you had to ram SSD hard drive
decent power supply be probably at it
for cheaper than that but that'd be like
the perfect balance for a solid gaming
PC or a 1070 TI if you pick it up
cheaper what's the delta between an 8400
and a 2600 what do you mean the delta I
saw the price difference know the frame
rate Delta I mean if you're looking at
six cores locked non overclocked
and compare that to six course 12
threads overclocked which I'll give it
I'll get into a little bit of credit
they're like AMD's overclocking
potential even rising to his perspective
is dim in comparison Intel's but I just
feel like I don't know I I'm still
struggling to come to terms with the
fact that the i5 should still I know
that it's a marginally better gamer
like I know that but are you willing to
say that the extra four or five FPS on a
hundred hundred twenty FPS gameplay
justifies cutting you at your knees when
it comes to multi-threading support yeah
but what do what are you multi-threading
that's the thing it's like streaming
anything like do so many pieces so many
more people now are extremely even if
you got no streamers there's no video no
people watching on your stream like many
people do you got Quang sing support man
you know powerful that is people I do
your streams looking so good I'm using
quick sync save the file most people
don't know how to even set that up I
mean like yeah but they just plug and
play I mean quick sync I mean you have
to have IGP enable they most of the I
GPS don't even enable and biases
it's a manually most of the one like
when I've had to do stuff with hardware
acceleration with the I GPS and Sadie's
I've had okay I've had to go into the
BIOS manually and turn on into Intel HD
graphics but one is an in Australia I
know us has a massive like AMD cult
following in a stray bit we just don't
care they buy what's best for him
apparently like the 8400 is the CPU
that's selling here everyone wants an
i-5 8400 it's the most popular new sold
CPU here at the moment it's selling
really well dude it's it's crazy how
well that thinks selling I mean I
believe it but I just I feel like it's
just because Intel's been the only thing
that they've known for a long time so I
mean that's why Intel such a huge
following right it's all like did
Rossum's created some waves man Rosen's
created some big white certainly as here
in the states I think that I would be
surprised if the i5 8400 was selling
more than the r5 equivalent I Fred I
really would just just because
I don't know it seems like so many
people now are getting behind this like
higher core Cal higher you know just
higher thread count ratio that we seem
to be on and to be frank most people
aren't gonna utilize 12 threads and even
if they do they're not gonna know that
they are they're not gonna see a
difference on screen most of the time so
I think it just comes down to how its
market how its portrayed how people like
us portray those products and and you
know i don't know i think that the i5
has more of a place now in the market
because we do have things other than z
370 it was a bit stupid to recommend z
370 mi5 8400 me in a sense but now with
B 360 out you know there's a place for
it I just think that that place is very
niche and it yeah I'm just telling you
on the front lines dude like everyone
has they won an i7 or an i-5 like
everyone I sold PCs to they've won an i5
or 97 dude it's like I haven't had one
person asked me for a rise in CPU and
their build yet it's like whoa give it
are you sellin mostly used component
mean back one yeah and it was relevant
like like it still it's like you know
they're rising five sixteen hundred for
example made huge waves and I liked that
CPU is a great value proposition but ya
know who knows who knows
okay so streaming a game I mean yeah
I've got it I've got to do something
about streaming anyway I've got to do
some benchmarks on it Mikey I'm not
gonna like that's gonna be the video in
the pipeline that's gonna be later this
is so much in the pipeline but I want to
look into streaming and seeing what the
best sort of value-for-money setup is
that people can get away with because
I'm thinking with Queen sync you could
probably even get away with an 80 100
that's how powerful quick sink is you
know what I mean for what video editing
for premiere it's an awful premiere but
like streaming right I mean how many
people editing videos like maybe a lot
of people want to stream but alike could
you get away with an 80 100 for
streaming like 6 megabits per second for
example with a GTX 10 6 I'm sure
play games while you're streaming
there's no I mean well that's what I
want to give it a go I want to give it a
shot
like yeah I just for me every time I
stream and Steven even if I got high in
gear I always still look at that
efficient option you know I want to make
sure that if something happens like I
pull up tweak town or something that's
just got so many ads getting plastered
in my face or a website at Toms hardware
that just crashed before that that
website seems to gone gone to crap you
know if you've you're not gonna your
streams not gonna crash you know it
makes you go that extra Headroom there
but if you like going near 100 percent
on your stream that's sort of like whoa
you you bound for problems drop frames
even for course no I mean for Moore's
and that's it like it's that's like an
old i5 all I 5s were fine for gaming and
to an extent they still are but getting
a new car I mean what an i3 8100 now
what sells for 130 140 US so you could
get a rise in five 1400 for core a
thread CPU for around that price and you
can soak that one so coalition's
pointing out the visual quality it's not
yeah you stream with and nvn see that
you record with quick sync so the quick
syncs recording the stream archives in
case you need it you know what I mean
that's what any stream is gonna do if
because if their stream drops out or
whatever they've got that back up there
when you include with quick sync and
premier it's literally I mean you can't
tell much of it if frankly like yeah
it's it's something I was talking with
Demetri from hardware connects about
this because he was one of the ones that
brought it to my attention and he was
saying cuz I asked him that specifically
I'm like well like you're not using my
extract to 64 do you notice a difference
like in compression quality how does it
look after you've rendered it and he's
held him side by side he I'll take his
word for it you know I trust I got with
any video any video editing content
creation advice he straight up said you
can tell much of a difference at all so
yeah you have to be pixel peeping oh
yeah what youtube on their smartphones
or on small screens or small in so yeah
I mean yeah well there's guys are like
the content kings of quality like video
quality so if they're using quick thing
that's
bacon big lengths for it so right right
yeah anyway who knows guys questions we
want some everyone's like chatting we
want we want questions oh yes give us
some good content oh yeah when it's good
reactions people are saying that the
chat is not scrolling so let me fix that
oh sorry I just completely oh yes I'm
saying I'm watching I'm watching the
chat live dude yeah yeah but but in the
in the Box like in the window it's
they're saying it's not scrolling let me
see yeah browser source okay oh yeah the
actual chat on the line it should be
better no it should be good now yeah
it's working now okay thanks for
bringing that up I'm sorry that we had
to watch that whole thing without
without ace people like that juicy mic
man you get right up to it that's what
condenses are all about oh yeah you like
when I gave her the clothes too right
where is pet to you where is pets oh I
walked her out of this room she'll just
start shooting through cables and stuff
and it's just not worth it she she bout
a tour through this charity last time I
had her in here so that's awesome Jamie
you know cat purrs yeah exactly
I told Chris all round like Chris I
might ask you for another chair in the
near future James go which brands do you
prefer for motherboard and graphics card
I it doesn't really matter to me I don't
I don't they care asus gigabyte msi
those my big three the lenses i have a
lens video a couple videos back it's a
camera guide and it talks about the
lenses i use so go watch that video it's
quicker than explaining motherboards i
mean there's some good motherboards out
there over GPUs I'm usually a Zeus Galax
or EVGA for GPUs
yeah same yeah even just great yeah even
J's might think Monday when I think I
like EVGA a lot a Susan is probably a
close second
just off the total they all come around
this behind me yeah yeah I mean there's
not gonna be much of a difference I
would say the quietest ones I've used in
general have been really like how quite
a bj cards are there they will bill yeah
they're really quiet
Sarah fasts am I gonna make video yeah
we may need that video man Oh actually
yeah waiting on the order to come in
taking ages from overseas I could
actually check the status hope we didn't
get didn't get shipped back sir rusty
Greg I need a 1080 P 144 it's monitor 24
27 inches no juicing or freezing to
replace a monitor any ideas I would
literally type in 1080p 144 Hertz on
Amazon you know restrict your size to 24
27 don't go any higher than 27 in most
cases you don't want a thicker monitor
for gaming and look for look for brands
like LG Acer bank you that's right way
to keep it like in the realm of like
known brands most of the time you're
gonna have better panels you won't have
as much backlight bleed especially if
you have an IPS display the fair the
fair middle grounds gonna be VA and in
my experience like I've had better luck
with backlight bleed and with dead
pixels when it comes to the VA panels
even though they don't look as good as
IPS the vertical alignments just that's
like an easy middle ground and you're
gonna pay less forward generally so yeah
I are gonna zoos do great job on their
VA panels with their color
I've never had an issue a panel I think
oh man the 35 inch ultra white is good
dude get that thing chocolate on cinema
mode it's it just looks gorgeous for
games dude I've been just thinking about
you know going hiatus and then just yeah
where's Brian beard
you got indulging with this 35 inch
ultra wide it's pretty good can you
recommend risin 2400 G for streaming I
haven't tried it for streaming like I
did though yeah there's some streaming
benchmarks I mean depends if you're
using again it comes down to what's your
setup with streaming and that's
something I gotta look into because yeah
I always stream off the GPUs codec
and you know they had a built-in encoder
and it does mean serves me really well
yeah isn't envy envy yeah so you want to
keep the load off your CPU it's not if
you can utilize GPU encoding and so much
more so much more power available to the
GPU than the rest of the CPU
that's why GPU computes just taking off
this is so much like that's so much more
potential and we have thousands of
course versus a processing use GTX 970
on UT tape since it's 60 same price ten
sixty all the way you guys use
mechanical keyboards with switches to
you prefer those red switches he's got
red colors are now on streams silence
which is using the corsair strafe it's
so good this thing is nice they do a
good job of their silence which is the
personal use it's the the room not the
Roman geez but similar from on Ron they
are really nice to type on yeah do this
those switches are really good so yeah
you got to get something if you don't
have them I've had gear ons before and
remember they were blues started with a
K I think or something like that but
they were blue switches really tech
actually my first mechanical keyboard
fell in love with it and I used it for
six months and then I started getting
review samples from companies and they
were all using MX so I've been using MX
for a long time but there's something
about the off-brand
I think it was kale was a kale switcher
or kick how do you say it okay kales
yeah there was called kales they hold
kales they were kale blues yeah and kale
I love like I don't know there's
something about cherry MX's that just
feel mush your eyes sounds really
strange but like the the off Frankie's
like Gator on scaled all those to me
those are more tactile even the brown
switches just feel more responsive to me
and I thought if I can't use any
scientific term to describe it's just a
user experience and I like the big Gator
try the creative it's the ko8 I think
the keyboard just try it man you gotta
try it and it's for me it wasn't my
favorite subjectively didn't feel the
best but objectively it was the best
keyboard I'm typing on I make little
mistakes I typed like a beast fast you
know yeah like it's you know one of my
friends came around the other day and
he's like whoa you dude you type fast
and it's that that keyboard is just boss
man something about those switches
they're just they're responsive they
they're forgiving and they're the omron
switches on the keyboard they've really
like the Japanese a really program then
things well hmm so yeah I'll take there
thanks man appreciate it he loves this
ring someone asked what headset this is
these are the Sennheiser 58 X 58
yeah 58 X is same thing yeah I got these
from mass drop they asked me to do a
review on own and I actually might we're
gonna do a couple promotional things
with them in the future but they sent
these they wanted me to test them out
and see if I'd be willing to do a review
on them I think I'm gonna because these
are actually I just wasn't sure if I
want to do a review on I on a headset
that doesn't have a mic right cuz like
most yeah most people watch you know
they're gamers so I'm not sure yet if
that's gonna be applicable the video
will probably get like 10,000 views if
that like YouTube's been shopping us at
the knees when it comes to views on
those kinds of videos lately so I mean
it frankly I don't expect many people
will just like check on YouTube for
peripheral reviews but I might do one
just because I like the headset crisp
audio as usual from Sennheiser so you
just like you gotta go to get a bit more
enthusiastic man you'll be like dude
it's cuz it's 2:00 a.m. I'm sorry I'm
trying we're gonna get you down the gym
get you on the cardio oh yeah if I do
cardio I used to run all the time you
know I used to run like in middle school
I was the county champion in the mile I
ran when I was 13 years old I can run a
mile in 5 minutes and 20 seconds and
and then I stopped that by the time I
got to high school I was like screw this
crap I hated running like it sucked I
just hated the feeling I prefer
sprinting but I wasn't as fast as some
of the kids on my track team so you know
I always played soccer growing up and I
just kind of invested everything into
that in high school but I ran a lot
that's why I'm really skinny like oh my
both my brothers are pretty big
they're like 160 170 pounds but I'm like
one I think the most I've ever weighed
is 155 and that was when I balked heavy
my first year in college I was jacked
and then I stopped doing it because I
started the channel I started the
engineering program and I lost all of it
I literally lost 20 20 pounds or so of
straight muscle just because I stopped
working out twice a day and even 15
grams of protein every meal okay it was
just so much worth dude so much work to
keep up I couldn't do it mm-hmm
oh yeah we got asked about 60-percent
cables yeah they're great for traveling
for normal use I prefer my full-size
keyboard and how about you yeah it
doesn't bother me too much I don't use
the I don't like like the numpad I don't
really use that much at all frankly the
only time I do use it is when I'm like
signing into into Windows because it's
just more convenient to reach there
instead of on top for my enter my pin or
whatever but yeah I don't mind it 60
presents fine for most nice things I
would say yeah there we go there Amanda
maybe yes do a couple more here let's do
a couple more and get you to sleep dude
yeah I was gonna say Paul Greg yeah next
time guys next time the stream will be
on fire oh yeah coming off combi text
this month has been hard to get through
after that you know was it was heavy
yeah yeah I'm trying folks I'm trying
then Brian was really patient you guys
are all patient I mean I was trying to
figure out a frickin internet problem
that I was having at one
no I still don't know what that was
anyway that's good something let's get a
couple PC questions in here stuff I feel
like we can both pitch in and we'll call
it a night or a day depending on where
you live on the planet give us something
good something juicy that Brian and I
can both disagree on Sacco
yeah what position you played man I was
a center Center forward and then I
switched to 11 forward after my first
second year in high school okay Greg
needs to cuddle with Pepsi I don't know
where she is but I'm pretty sure she's
sleeping already
I prefer to stay that way she always
wakes us up in the middle my good stuff
we need some good stuff folks give us
some questions to end dish dream what's
up
no that's or we just and straining yeah
we're just on the street I mean if you
guys let me other questions we're just
see you guys yeah here's one here yeah
he's asking about HDMI I said do you
guys think people should hold off on 4k
monitors till HDMI 2.1 or DisplayPort
1.5 is out for the highest Hertz rates
what does DisplayPort max out it doesn't
it do 4k 120mm you know I'm not sure off
the top of my head I just know that I
know that 4k anyway is more intense on
your GPU from like a competitive gaming
standpoint as well yeah I'd believe I
haven't researched it too much but 120
Hertz 4k that is really it supports
don't really want it's not really one
thing that's discussed a whole lot but
is it practical you know I mean if you
need the Huayra frame at high refresh
rates you're probably like a snap master
King yeah dude just picture the
resources required you know that exactly
so you probably like a snap monster King
already and you probably gonna be better
off suited on a 1:8 1080p mm-hmm so
that's sort of like when you start to go
up at those resolutions yeah yeah
whatever just get a lower resolution and
sit closer to your monitor then display
that's really why they're scared to push
it's gonna be really expensive you're
gonna have so much money to drop on
graphics cards yeah
yuuji needles crabs ones taken forever
and if your and I think if you're into
an exciting experience I think the 21 by
nine-thirty 34 40 ultra-wide is just so
good nine hundreds it's it's nice it's
enjoyable then you returned a
competitive gaming mantra go 240 Hertz
1080p so like where does 4k sort of fit
in there mm-hmm
that's just my thinking anyway I mean
I'm not gonna be in like to be honest
like if people are waiting out for 4k
hundred twenty Hertz I'm just like dude
I'm not even interested in it at all
it's gonna come with it's just gonna
come with within graphics card territory
I mean look like next-gen stuff whatever
we expect from nvidia and AMD those
cards whatever benchmarks those set
those standards are gonna determine
whether or not 4k becomes a household
resolution for gaming so if like right
now like you go out and buy what's it
what's an I don't wanna say average car
but what's one a lot of people buy a ten
sixty right or a ten seventy those cards
are 1080p 1440p alright that's that's as
high as I would feel I would you could
game in 4k on a ten seventy but we're
talking you know medium settings usually
if you want to push them to high and
ultra where they actually picture
actually looks good then you're gonna
need something like a 1080 Ti and in my
opinion 4k at medium settings is stupid
to begin like why the heck would you
want to enhance the resolution of a game
that is like dumbed down from a
graphical standpoint like then you're
just making those graphics graphical
settings look even worse because you're
making them in a higher resolution so to
me it's counterproductive we would need
more mainstream cards that are able to
push out 4k at higher graphical settings
we don't have yeah so we're in a bit of
a bit of a ya loop at the moment yeah
okay you got a sli 1080i that's 1200
bucks that's a full-on PC right there
just for two graphics for the green I
know that's it Greg's got you down pat
if you're not go back you 4k needs you
guys know I I love the way it looks but
it's just to me it's not worth it from
from a gamers perspective it's not
content creation different story
watching Netflix different story but not
you know not game should anyone spend
upper 1200 bucks for this sound system
of course I mean it depends on what you
are as an individual are you a sound
like
everyone's different right we're tuned
like I'm more of a visual guy but I'm
not like for me at Logitech Z 906 is all
I need for sound it's perfect but I can
appreciate that there's people out there
who who obviously there is a better than
mine and they can go spend more on that
and that's their passion and hobby I
respect that so yeah of course if you're
into audio and that's your thing mm go
spend the money on it enjoy yourself
yeah ah really I've got it subjective
yeah it same with visuals like I prefer
1440p at the moment it's sort of my
sweet spot abroad over 4k up for the
high refresh rates and further value and
so that's sort of where it's at for me
you know I added on a 4k monitor because
that you don't need high refresh rates
for that it's sort of like you need the
caller accuracy it's in the real estate
yeah so yeah anyway I think it's same
for me yeah I have I think the most ever
spent on a sound system was like six
seven hundred dollars and it wasn't like
it was good enough for me
like if I and I listened I went to Best
Buy and I listened to all the different
sound systems and I got all right next
to some of those things and I was trying
to tell some of them I could tell huge
difference right just on what's the
basic presets
connecting my phone to all of them
alright as many as I could when you
stopped hearing the difference that's
you're like that's your ceiling right
from your audio to starting standpoint
some people can discern much higher than
that and they're the true audio files I
wouldn't consider myself an audiophile
I just think that I I prefer better
sounding speakers when people just don't
care about it
I prefer better sound so that's why I
think it's worth spending the extra
money and same goes for resolution like
you were saying like my sweet spots
1440p 120 144 hurts I'm using a 1080p
monitor right now in front of me and
it's no I did I can tell the difference
from two feet I can see the difference
between 1440p and 1080 we got asked two
questions a time with each other do you
agree with ufd tape and now is a bad
time to build a PC in 1080 T I have 600
now white for 1180 I think it's a great
time to buy everything but the graphics
card so go look for them deals
remember I'm contrarian though by nature
I love doing
what other people aren't if no one's
buying a PC now you should be buying at
least the parts that are cheap
go get your case go get your motherboard
go get your CPU go get all that stuff
cheap and then when the graphics cards
drop then buy the graphics card and they
will so don't even but that's why I
meant don't buy the 1080i now wait for
the 1180 because that's gonna come
around the tight the same time the
storms gonna happen and when the storm
happens you're gonna get your cheap
graphics card this is my opinion so yeah
go buy the components that are cheap at
the moment so I think it's a good time
to build a partial PC for new pcs anyway
always a good time to build a use PC
he's got to get the deals no man I'm
really gonna get a looter Greg again
Brian please suggest your favorite ever
socket or platform and then argue why
yours is better than the other okay so
its socket x58 okay I feel like whatever
I say if we're gonna be on different
world because I don't usually all their
stuff we can hold this off till next
time as well so yeah I don't know sudden
I gotta go bro like really bad on
Brian's qio remember that one for next
time I'm off to think of something
clever because I feel like just saying
like something modern is a little lame
cuz I understand why you say x58 alright
we're gonna bend it so Brian can go pee
and we'll be back next week for the good
stuff folks thanks for watching early
this morning or late at night and we
will catch you in the next one hey you
