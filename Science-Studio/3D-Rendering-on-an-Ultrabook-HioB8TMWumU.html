possible the answer obviously is yes as
long as a computer in mind meets the
minimum spec requirements of the program
being used sure it can be done usually
those spec requirements are bare-bones
if you will but an ultrabook like this
obviously isn't designed with 3d
modeling in mind so how well does it
perform to start off let me remind you
of this laptop specifications this is
the Dell XPS 13 which I reviewed right
here check it out if you haven't already
it's sporting an i7 7700 ukb Lake
ultra-low power processor and 16
gigabytes of ddr3 L it's also fitted
with a 512 gigabyte nvme SSD and the
3200 by 1800 qhd+ takes their display I
bought this laptop fully loaded and for
a good reason I wanted to be able to
edit videos on the fly without a hitch
now this isn't the best laptop you could
buy for video editing on the go
obviously there are things that are
frankly much bigger that would do a much
better job but obviously those are heavy
their bulky they don't typically have
excellent battery life so an ultrabook
is a compromise I'm willing to make for
the sake of portability as well as
having 9 to 10 hours of battery life
with this thing it's actually very good
and as for video editing it gets the job
done I like to compare the soldier book
to a desktop grade I three PC the very
first PC I ever built featured in I 340
158 gigs of ddr3 and a gtx 750ti we've
come a long way since then in terms of
desktops and laptops but I was frankly
able to edit and render comfortably on
that I three and that's about the Sun
experience I have with this Dell XPS 13
many of you have been asking why I got
rid of my MacBook I owned it for about
four months before giving it to my
sister for Christmas she absolutely
loves it I'm glad I gave it to her she's
probably making better use of it than I
ever would I was just at that point
getting into the whole OSN experience
you know just getting used to using Macs
in general but then I found out that for
my last semester here in college I was
going to need a window space laptop in
order to run many of the programs that
I'll need for my senior design project
and among those is Petrille it's a 3d
modeling software you can actually do
way more than that on there but for the
purposes of this video it will allow you
to create a 3d model of a chunk of Earth
that you'll essentially be drilling into
or just surveying what you're looking at
here is essentially my senior design
project as
of it as I have at this point it's in
wireframe divided into three layers and
littered with faults and cross-sections
the first thing I want to point out is
how much RAM the program is using you
see we're around five to six and
gigabytes it's recommended that any 3d
modeling system have at least 16 gigs 32
is ideal because it's probably more than
you'll ever need but I would say that 8
gigabytes in any Ultrabook would be
cutting it pretty darn close you
probably couldn't run anything else in
the background I was able to do that no
problem here thanks to that 16 gig
buffer it was also interesting to
observe CPU utilization while this 3d
map is being rendered usage never
approached 100% not even close frankly
even while we were manipulating the 3d
object which tells me that the software
was trying to rely on a dedicated
graphics processor which this ultra book
does not have I should also mention the
Petrelli is designed with CUDA
technology in mind which is by
Heisenberg ran the entire simulation
without any hitches whatsoever but of
course the more objects you throw into
the 3d plane the more taxing it will be
on your system latency is definitely an
issue at times especially when new
objects are to be rendered in the 3d
window but it's not something I would
call unbearable the cool thing is even
when the professor is showing us how to
do something in patrol in class I can
just pull on my laptop and run through
the steps alongside him that's exactly
what I was hoping for that's why I sold
the MacBook and I'm glad that the XPS 13
can deliver now if you're wondering
about how other 3d modeling programs
behave on ultrabooks like this I would
say that it depends largely on that
programs optimization and how much RAM
you have I really mean this when I say
it's 16 gigabytes is the very bones
minimum I recommend for any 3d modeling
computer especially in ultrabooks it
isn't designed with that in mind you
might get by with 12 gigabytes of RAM
and it does matter if it's ddr3l or ddr4
you won't notice much of a difference
between the two so don't really take
that into consideration but I would say
12 is that's cutting it really close
eight gigabytes just don't count on
doing anything else in the background
maybe Spotify or Pandora or in the
background that's about it
I do hope at least this video helps
clear up a few of your concerns about
ultrabooks
and they're processing potential they
are compromises keep that in mind you're
buying a laptop with a smaller footprint
at the expense of specifications you
could buy a 15.6
$800 laptop with better specifications
than my Dell XPS 13 that's just a fact
check this one out right here or here
point made if you ask me ask yourself
what you expect your laptop to be able
to do well and then go on from there
don't go into this expecting a 12-inch
Ultrabook to be able to play games at 60
fps and 1440p it's just not going to
happen the technology isn't there yet we
can't fit dedicated graphics chips and
quad core HQ processors into form
factors that small at this point and
even if we could the heat output would
be extreme needless to say everything in
life is some sort of compromise and the
XPS 13 was one I was willing to make if
you liked this video be sure to give it
a thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
feel the complete opposite click a

I'll catch you in the next video this is
