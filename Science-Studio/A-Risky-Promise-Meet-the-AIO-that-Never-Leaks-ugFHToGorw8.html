never same goes for the word always
guarantees like these are just too risky
from a legal standpoint imagine if say
Michelin started stating that their
tires never ran flat imagine if Phillips
said their lightbulbs never die not only
with this being extremely costly
measured to defend in court but it could
potentially harm other things around it
including people and other expensive
machinery so when deep cool designs a
new all-in-one liquid cooler and then
puts this at the top of their webpage
your eyes should be doing this right

debit cards tied securely to your bank

card information with a single click get

clicking the link below today so let's
cut through the crap
what is the captain 240 pro well it's
deep cools latest a i/o centered on
addressable r2b functionality and a
patented pressure relief valve which
regulates circulatory pressure via a
bladder at the base of the radiator now
we'll get into that more in a bit but
what I want to first address is
performance seeing isn't though nothing
pertaining to cooling capacities
mentioned on the splash page it makes
sense to assume this cooler design
doesn't venture too far from older
Captain Series performance and sure
enough CPU temperatures between the pro
and older exa iOS are virtually
indistinguishable this means that you
should expect an effective TDP similar
to or slightly better than that of a
crier rig h7 or hyper 212 Evo in my own
personal testing this isn't necessarily
a bad thing
we're just limited here in terms of the
size of the radiator as well as the
strength of the pump which arguably is a
bit weak it's similar to next tech pump
but it's not in a so tech pump the CPU
block is certainly unique and this one
is basically one of the big reasons why
I think it's the best design overall in
the business the equal doesn't slap a
giant logo on this thing so you can turn
this block any which direction without
cringing at the sight of upside down
text or anything of the sort
this is especially useful when the a i/o
is paired with a fairly large case and
tubing length is kind of short so you
may only be able to install the cooler
in one particular orientation and it's
nice to not have that bias on the block
I'm also a huge fan of these RG B's and
the way in which deep will manage to
isolate individual zones these plastic
grooves replace the previous model solid
plate and I think it's a step in the
right direction it's again more zone or
DB based a thin clear band wraps around
the blocks perimeter and syncs up with
the grooves by the way the iconic
u-shaped glass pipe is still present as
well inside we've got a draconian
ceramic bearings which are basically
those like cheaper diamond substitutes
that have a relatively high degree of
hardness and durability and there's also
a dual chamber three-phase pump in here
which does a decent job staying quiet
even while operating at several thousand
rpm so all in all there's nothing
exceptionally brilliant going on inside
of here but I don't see anything
alarming either and that's a good thing
especially when it comes to something as
precious as this because this right here
could tank your entire system and people
who have had these leak in the past know
exactly what I'm talking about the two
included 120 millimeter fans by the way
are also RGB addressable and do a decent
job staying quiet under heavy load and
include fan hub makes cable routing much
easier you can sync up all the RGB
either with the included controller or
via three pin RGB header on most
motherboards support to date includes
gigabytes RGB fusion software asus ora
MSI's mystic light sweet and ass rocks
polychrome sync so at this point if
you're disappointed with the lack of a
performance improvement with the model
don't be I mean this cooler can be
purchased for just over 100 USD and
that's equivalent to the price of the
EXR GB version so you're basically
getting a little more for about the same
price and possibly added security with
the new pro model but on just that
security should you seriously expect
this thing to never leave and I'll be
very blunt with you my answer is no you
shouldn't expect this thing to never
leak I actually pulled you guys on
Twitter I haven't checked the results
but I'm pretty sure a majority of you
either said you were indifferent to the
idea that you could trust people with
this statement or you straight-up didn't
trust it at all and that's because using
the word never again especially in this
industry is just too risky and it
definitely puts them under a particular
degrees of legal liability I'm gonna be
interested to see how this plays out for
them in the long run granted they are
based in China so I'm not sure how that
would play into it but I don't know I
just feel like it's super irresponsible
so yeah you shouldn't expect this thing
to never leak and there are several
reasons why for one this AIO has several
fail points in fact the iconic u-shaped
glass tubing here is a huge point of
failure for these coolers that's not to
say that a lot of them leak failure
rates are still pretty low according to
deep pools own record but if the 240 Pro
does leak I'd bet money it'd be right
around here
the reason why I has to do with the
material use remember the glass the
glass is rigid and requires a higher
degree of precision to
burly seal it can also shatter daring
shipping mostly I always avoid using
glass or acrylic for this very reason
and this dead stick to something that's
a little more flexible you know we have
braided tubing that's what we always see
we've seen that for the past 10 or so
years since AI o--'s have really become
a big thing I'd say the last four or
five years we've always seen the
flexible and a braided or rubber or
silicone tubing and there's a good
reason for that they've stuck with that
because it is reliable and easy to work
with rubber and silicone are flexible
easy to seal easy to reinforce and can
handle significantly higher degrees of
tension and closed systems they're the
logical choices right
so when deapool tries to be different
and include real glass they're
introducing an additional variableness
point of failure technically though
three points of failure if you count
both ends where they're supposed to be
sealed and the tube length itself which
could shatter you know even a smaller
pinprick could cause a leak the pressure
relief valve found at the base of the
radiator is designed to relieve this
pressure new influxes of pressure I
should say basically pockets of air that
are introduced into the system gas
consumes a relatively wider volume
compresses the liquid increases the
pressure in the loop and the stresses
these various points of failure
especially the glass seals so difficult
did something about it instead of
removing the iconic glass to but they
decided to include this pressure relief
valve that's what they're calling it and
it's actually a semi flexible bladder
tied to the atmosphere which means it's
connected to basically the environment
directly when pressure spikes are
introduced larger small the bladder
compresses and that vents more air
occupying this space so this would
effectively decrease the bladder size
increase the effective volume of the
loop and when volume increases in a
closed system the resulting pressure
drops it isn't a foolproof technique and
the science behind it is fairly
elementary but it could certainly
mitigate slight bumps and pressure no
doubt about it now the issue I have with
this though is that the relief valves
viability is tied directly to an issue
it can't mitigate and that's a break and
a seal or a crack somewhere else in the
system first of all if we assume the
loop operates at a pressure slightly
higher than atmospheric then it's
significantly less likely right for air
outside of the loop to make its way into
the loop that's operating
higher pressure so one of the ways we
know this happens in the real world is
by you know syringe or forced injection
some water cooling companies do this
with their AOS to test tolerances up to
30 or even 40 psi but that's just it
they have to literally force additional
air into these systems and a IO can
certainly leak from a pressure spike but
the likelihood of one occurring in your
typical everyday AIO
is relatively low so what's the
alternative then well excluding outliers
like improper sealing and collision a
majority of AIO failures stem from pump
failures this is typically exhibited by
a steady rise in core temperatures to
the point where they massively throttle
themselves or shut down entirely we can
simulate this by simply refusing to
connect the pump cable I don't want to
kill one of my CPUs or risk damaging it
or the IO for that matter but a possible
outcome from such an event could be a
leak but why when the fluid gets too hot
most areas are filled with a water-based
mixed with various corrosion inhibitors
and when it all reaches an unhealthy
temperature seals could expand and break
that's what he does and there's your
lead what's a healthy fluid temperature
you ask it really depends but I'd be
uncomfortable if temperatures approached
50 degrees Celsius in a custom loop so
something similar for a iOS as well if
your pump fails all heat generated by
the CPU saturates the block side of the
IO because you have enough circulation
right and could force fluid temps into
uncharted territories I'll just leave it
at that
upwards of 70 or 80 degrees if left long
enough this is far outside recommended
levels at which point the integrity of
the system is in jeopardy and pretty
much any you know sure any guarantee you
have with an IO like this is out the
window so I say all that to say this
deep cools pressure relief valve while
cool in principle is nothing new per se
I mean some custom water coolers have
been implementing similar bleed off
valves for years and they're also
typically in the rads but to say that
because of this right here that the
entire a IO will never week is just a
bit disingenuous and the more I study
this mechanism and the a IO is an entire
system the more I realize that this is
the case I guarantee that if I pulled
hard enough I could break the seal
around the glass there's your leak if I
left the pump unplugged and let and core
kay you know do its thing something
would probably break there's your leak
and a pressure relief valve won't do a
damn thing while all of this is
happening so that's what I really want
you guys to take away from this is that
it really only solves part of the
problem and that's why I have an issue
with deep cool just blanket stating the
fact that their coolers will never leak
because of that valve because it really
doesn't solve all of the concerns and
look I know that you know not plugging
and the pump is a cheap shot obviously
that's gonna run this thing out of spec
intentionally and you know if I really
wanted to force something loose I'm sure
I could do that they're not expecting
you to do that but that's why you don't
say never in this industry because it
could be user error I mean look I blew
up two power supplies thinking always
using the correct cables when I wasn't
we all remember that so you know if deep
cool had said this is a great way to
mitigate leaks it's not foolproof but
it's pretty darn close I'd probably vibe
with that I mean saying even pretty
close is a stretch and I think most of
us with half a brain would know why but
this is again I mean you can't use the
word never with this hey this would
never I don't know I don't even know how
they could sell this in the US market
using that as you know their marketing
tool by stating that it never leaks
because we all know that it can and even
if I don't intentionally do something
let's say the pump fails that happens a
lot okay if a pump fails on nai oh I
mean I say a lot you know what I mean it
if the IO dies it's because of the pump
wasn't likely if the pump dies then
there you go I didn't intentionally do
anything about it you know I didn't
intentionally sabotage the IO it can I
did it to itself but that could result
in a leak and often that is what happens
that the fluid just gets too hot a seal
breaks and there you go
whether it be on the block or you know
toward the radiator side the seals
between the radiator and the tubing it
couldn't really be anywhere it could
just be a hole somewhere in the rat
there's your leak you can't use the word
never you just can't
so the relief valve is designed to
mitigate pressure spikes not pressure
leaks and that's why I claim like this
in my opinion is a stretch of the truth
so why then can a company like Depot get
away with it and why can they get away
with it specifically in US markets
well for starters
they're based out of China so if you
bought this cooler and noticed it
leaking you'd be hard-pressed to find a
lawyer willing to sue and that's
assuming you had the finances required
to do it in the first place and this
again is a huge reason why companies
avoid words like this saying that
something never happens to a particular
product often associated with that very
thing is ballsy at best and careless at
its worst and as for US markets US
retailers imagine if deep cool started
shipping these worldwide I mean they
already do basically you can find these
and Newegg you find them I think on
Amazon but another name is on yet I'm
sure they'll be there shortly and then
all of a sudden we started getting
reports at these leak right the source
is deep cool we would blame deep cool
but then we might also blame Newegg we
might also try to blame amazon for
selling a product that is falsely
advertising its own viability its own
durability and that could be a problem
for the retailer's so I'm not sure how
long they're gonna be able to get away
with this my thinking is that this is
something that is short-lived I'm sure
it'll just magically disappear one day
we won't hear anything about the no leak
scenario anymore to just it just won't
be on the page and that's how they'll
fix it and that's how the remedy it but
for those of us who are buying into this
who are buying these products thinking
that they're just not gonna leak because
some magical valve is correcting every
issue that could ever go wrong with any
IO I mean we're gonna be let down we're
gonna be disappointed and some of us
might try to do something about it it
will be very costly but vehicles should
be worried and I don't know my own tuam
my intuition is telling me that it's
probably gonna be stressful for Amazon
and Newegg to I don't know I'm not a
lawyer but I would be concerned if I was
them as well I mean this is why
companies like Coursera NZXT fractal
design be quiet and others have never
used this wording not that they could
even get away with it in the European
and American markets anyway even if we
assume they thought of implementing a
similar valve which I'm sure they have
the risks are not eliminated and they
never legally be able to make such a
claim so deep cool if you're watching
and I'm sure you will because I'll link
this video to you I know what you're
trying to say I get it but the way your
wording it is misleading and our
deserved to know so do I recommend the
cooler actually yeah I do but not for
the reason you think I think it looks
beautiful and it does the job
any 240ml AIO should it isn't overpriced
it's the same price actually as the
previous model and it stays quiet even
under load installation is easy the fans
are decent quality the software
integration is spot-on I really like it
just don't buy it expecting it to never
leak and I feel like that's what deep
pools kind of hinging this wholesale on
is the fact that it won't leak because
we know that's not true
a company doesn't have like a crystal
ball and see the future and say that
none of these will ever leave so let me
know what you guys think about the
captain 240 Pro down below what you
think about the no leak thing and be
sure to check it out a via our affiliate
link in the video description
again remember don't buy this cooler
thinking it's not going to leak that
said I think it's a great cooler it
looks very well built I would say the
failure rates and these are gonna be as
low if not lower than the e^x variants
and they were already pretty low to
begin with again most of the leaks
either come from failed pumps or from
something going wrong with the glass
tubing but yeah the failure rates for
these coolers used to be quite a bit
worse and they've gotten significantly
better over time the more you do
something more familiar you are with it
better you can typically kind of sculpt
the product to fit the needs of the
consumer and my ultimate goal here is
just to pass along the the tip that you
shouldn't buy this thinking it's not
going to leak that said it is still a
great cool company but guys think about
the video thumbs up if you liked it
dislike it feel adopts it or if you hate
