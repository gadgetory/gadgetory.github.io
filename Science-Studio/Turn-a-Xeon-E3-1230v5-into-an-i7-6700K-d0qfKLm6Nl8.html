already know that but that's because I
really didn't know what else to call
this video we're essentially going to be
converting our xeon processor and its
behavior into that of a core i7 6700 k
so this is eon is based on 40 nanometers
phallic architecture we can only
specific motherboard specific server
grade motherboards c to 32 and c to 36
boards with this particular processor
and those boards generally don't allow
for overclocking how disappointing
however with as rocks III v5 gaming
overclocked motherboard it's possible
you can overclock a Xeon e3 v5 processor
I'm going to show you how in this video
the core i7 6700 K was predisposed to be
the best processor in the sky like
lineup we're talking about four cores
eight threads and an unlock multiplier
meaning endless possibilities depending
on how you decide to cool your CPU now
in the case of the Xeon e3 v5 1230 I
said that backwards 12:30 v5 things get
a little different because you can't
overclock that CPU technically so the
multiplier is locked which means that we
can't change that number to be
multiplied by our base clock frequency
to thus up or down our CPU frequency but
what we can do is change the base clock
frequency now if you saw my xeon gaming
bill but you can check out the card
above me I use an Asus gaming xeon
motherboard which did not allow for any
overclocking whatsoever i couldn't
change the basic clock frequency there
wasn't even option to change the
multiplier i understood all that when i
first bought all those parts and i did
recommend that a switch board in that
video but i am changing my mind because
asrock has since allowed for base clock
overclocking via their motherboard their
e3 v5 gaming overclocked motherboard
which you can pick up right now in the
US for about 140 bucks the answer of
BIOS was very simple to navigate through
it was very easily able to fly my base
clock frequency and race that in order
to attain the desired CPU frequency if
you interested in how to do all of that
I have a video detailing it in the card
above me go and check that one I'm not
gonna bother repeating that in this
video because I don't think it's
necessary to go and check that one out
instead I ultimately ended up very
satisfied with the overclock I was able
to obtain I ended up at 4.6 gigahertz
with a base clock frequency of just over
130 and a V core of 1.4 now I understand
that one point 4 volts is a bit high for
skylake processors a special
xeon processors that aren't designed at
all to be overclocked we reached about a
TC running Cinebench and about 85 c
running i-264
i'm not going to put it through prime95
because I know temperatures gonna hit
like a hundred C and I'm not interested
in doing that or wrecking my processor a
quick word on prime95 I only recommend
using that software if you're looking
for a very moderate and conservative
overclocked overclocking to this extent
will result in a fail under several
cores for prime95 it's just the result
of the software it pushes CPUs to very
very synthetic unrealistic extremes and
in the case of what I do with this
computer video editing rendering and
playing video games I'm not pushing the
CP anywhere near that point I already
have a series detailing CP frequency and
the advantages you'll see in games you
can check out part 1 of the series in
the cart above me but I will show you
however in this video are the CPU
synthetics what you can obtain when it
comes to just raw rendering power
cinnamon score and Geekbench scores go
ahead and throw those up
as you can see overclocking museum with
a threads is very beneficial that's why
I do recommend purchasing this as rock
overclocking motherboards aboard the
video's description be sure to check
that out sure to get the video a thumbs
up if you think the content in this
video was great give the thumbs down if
you hate everything about life you can
subscribe but if you haven't already
stay tuned for more content here on the
channel
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
