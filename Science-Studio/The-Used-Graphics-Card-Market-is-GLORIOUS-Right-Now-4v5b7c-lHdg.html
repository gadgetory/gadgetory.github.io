round of graphics cards from Nvidia I
don't blame you there's still hope for
you if you've been sitting on
eight-year-old hardware since the
beginning and dying for an upgrade
there's still hope for you now the
intent of this video is to shed light on
the beautiful huge graphics card market
and I practice what I preach I bought
not one not two but three used powerful
cards on eBay and for the lot I actually
paid a lot less than retail so let me
break it down here's what I paid for
each card at first is the gtx 980ti
we're looking at comparable gtx 1070
performance here with a 6 gig frame
buffer more maxwell cuda cores and the
pascal equivalent and a beefy amp
extreme custom PCB from zou tech all in
exchange for a higher TDP without
knowing which card was older you'd
probably think the 92 TI was the more
powerful card pascal architecture does
reign supreme
but the framerate disparities beg to
differ i'm averaging well over 60 fps
and all titles tested up to 1440p with
the 980 TI and i can even actually
handle 4k to an extent though I'd much
rather sacrifice 4k for higher frame
rates in lower resolutions I should also
add that 10 70s right now are selling
for similar prices and used markets I
found some EVGA cards for as low as 240
bucks used and that to me is a really
great deal I've searched eBay primarily
and always sort from best price you can
filter down to just the Buy It Now
option if you aren't interested in
bidding but don't be afraid to pitch a
few offers if you're comfortable in fact
this gtx 1080 right here was the one
that i bid on the 290 tea eyes were buy
it now sales and one of them i picked up
for two hundred and sixty bucks when i
got a little more familiar with the
market i found the second one identical
card same design and everything for two
hundred and twenty bucks that was a much
better deal in my book so right now you
can find any 2d eyes in all shapes and
sizes for around 200 bucks again custom
PCBs for your coolers are gonna cost
just a bit more than 10 70s for around
250 bucks great values when seen in the
context of new prices as for the GT x
1080 here I paid 320 bucks for it though
I lost to another bidder on an identical
card later on for 300 bucks so I'd try
to stay on this mark the 1080 is
considerably more powerful than the 1070
and 980ti and may
be worth the extra hundred bucks or so
if you intend to ramp up in game
settings this card right here uses a
reference PCB by the way so if you want
an aftermarket add-in board something
it's been customized just a little bit
for higher power loads let's say higher
overclocking support then you might pay
a bit more than three hundred dollars
for that particular card and by the way
with respect to eBay's bidding system if
you intend on bidding and notice the
current that is much lower than you'd be
willing to pay let's say there's a day
left in the bidding cycle you can always
place a bet much higher than this value
and eBay will actually increase the bid
in around five dollar increments when
others bet until your max bid is met so
for example if a current bid on a card
is 150 bucks but you'd be comfortable
paying up to 200 bucks for it
place the $200 bid and eBay will only
place a $155 bid or so on your behalf if
no one else bids on that card after that
point then you'd only pay 155 but if
someone bids you up
eBay raises the stakes and $5 increments
until you're $200 cap is met it's a good
way to ensure you pay the lowest price
possible for the item without needing to
sit in front of your screen all day
until the sale closes so if you place an
initial bid and someone immediately out
bids you it just means that their total
bid was higher than that bid that you
just submitted by the way if you're
worried about whether or not these cards
were used for mining there's really no
physical way to tell so you kind of have
to rely solely on context clues if a
seller is getting rid of dozens of ten
seventies for example he or she is
probably a miner if you literally see a
picture of a mining bench in the
background
probably a miner you get the point this
isn't a foolproof job and you'll never
really know for sure so it's something
you have to be okay with upfront now if
you're adamant about avoiding mining
cards all together a safer bet is
probably going with the Maxwell gen
stuff still not foolproof though most
ninety D eyes for example weren't used
for mining or public word since a lot of
these cards were released in 2015 people
bought them in 2015-2016 and mining
craze really didn't peak until around
2017 2018 so they may have been used for
mining but they weren't bought for
mining so they probably weren't run 24/7
you kind of rationalize it in your head
but I would say Pascal would be more
affected by this than Maxwell so if
you're okay with the higher power draws
from Maxwell these are probably your
safer bet if you don't want to get into
the mining stuff which again is hit or
miss so let's just say the odds are
better for the Maxwell
stuff by the way if you need something a
little weaker for around 120 or 140 USD
and you're comfortable again buying used
there are some pretty great rx 580 and
GTX 970 deals so the chance of the 580
is being used for mining are probably
higher than nine 70s but if you're set
on the US graphics per market again this
is the risk you've got to be willing to
incur and rx5 eighties are great for
some medium to high 1440p gaming 1080p
is a breeze and they'll be much more
efficient than their Maxwell you know
alternatives and I mean to be honest if
the card runs out of the box when you
buy it used it probably will run for the
next few years at least think about how
many CPUs for example randomly die
despite running for long periods of time
server CPUs literally never stop running
and you don't hear about too many of
those who need replacement usually it's
DRAM or it's some moving component like
a hard disk drive a graphics card is
like its own mini computer but it's all
on board right so it's a little more
fragile but again unless you slam the
card against something or bend it in a
weird way it probably won't die any time
soon
even if it was used and all that really
means is that it's set in a computer and
got intermittently hopped so chances are
if you're watching this video you're at
least interested in the possibility of
buying used
I know eBay screwed over more than one
person in the past there's always a
horror story or two in the comments
section but in a general sense if you
buy something and it turns out to not be
what you thought it was maybe it just
doesn't work or it didn't come with all
the gear that should have you can return
the item and get your money back under
the eBay buyer protection guarantee it's
safer than Craigslist in that respect
and only requires five to seven days
worth of shipping time in most cases so
if I was building a computer today I
would forgo r-tx completely I mean come
on this prices are ridiculous
I would even forego Pascal if we're
talking about new cards and by
straight-up use the value here is just
too good to pass up
but that's just my opinion now I want to
know what you guys think leave a comment
down below and include the most recent
graphics card you purchased along with
whether it was new or used if you're
considering an upgrade I strongly urge
you to check used markets first
Craigslist eBay offer up they're all
great starts give this video thumbs up
the others cool just like it for the
complete opposite feeling or if you hate
everything about life you guys click
that red subscribe button if you haven't
already into
if you wanna be fancy with it we'll
catch you in the next video this is
