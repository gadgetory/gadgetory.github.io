it's time to upgrade Walter white so I
used the 600 hour supply originally for
the bill that was because that was the
only thing I had on hand and that was
from deep cool still a good power supply
but I want more for this is my daily
driver I want to have just a ton of room
to expand which is what I plan on doing
I'll explain that more towards the end
of the video but what I've done is
replaced that 600 watt power supply
which was fully monitor by the way with
this 1000 watt DQ 1000 quanta from
vehicle this is an 80 plus gold rated
power supply from this is pretty much
the top of the line from vehicle and you
can find the link to this power supply
in this video's description this is a
absolute beast when you start
approaching 1000 watt power supplies
typically get very long and that's
because well most of the components
inside that are converting and producing
that much power getting very hot so
crunching them all very close together
is an ideal unless you have something
like a very fast moving fan to keep
things very cool which is uh Cnidaria
expensive unit but in the case of the DQ
1000 deep cool has managed to cram
everything into roughly a 140 millimeter
form factor so it's a single fan up top
or down low which depending on which way
you orient the power supply and that's
pretty much it that is the size of the
unit in terms of length and width and
then the height of course is a standard
PSU unit for ATX power supplies but all
in all this is an absurd amount of power
for what Walter White is currently
demanding with a single gtx 1070 and an
overclocked i7 6700 K but because I have
well big plans for the computer I'm
gonna need something that's that gives
me a lot more lead way a lot more room
to expand and on top of that is gonna be
very quiet under heavy load the other
thing I want to walk you through in this
video is the RAM swap so I used to have
yo super looser ddr4 those bright white
LED dims that were originally in Walter
White they are now a new rig that I just
assembled with Destin but I've taken
those dims in there and put them in here
night processing well Gregg those were
read before why are they white now
because I painted them that's what I
want to show you right now now with the
1000 watt power supply already tucked
inside the next thing to do is replace
the two dims in here with the four dims
from the other PC in the living room now
you're probably wondering well reg these
have white LED accents and the other Ram
back in the living room has
accent so that's not really gonna match
with anything you got in your rig that's
because I'm going to paint those in
there I'm gonna show you how to do that
it's very simple there's literally just
little screws that you have to undo on
each side of each dim and then we'll be
able to pull a little top panel off of
each of these on those dims
and then paint those white and the new
RAM will also be at 32 hundred megahertz
instead of 3,000 like these gills super
loose tim's are so up slightly faster
ram but albeit at a slightly higher
caste latency as well so really not
trading off much there so the way each
of these memory modules is designed
there's just three simple pieces the top
part here that's painted red and then
you have a front panel and a back panel
that both hold that top panel in place
and there's just four screws up top and
those four screws hold this red plate in
place now the red plate is what we're
gonna be painting white so for all four
of these tim's live white
I guess bars up top that you'll see in
Walter White once it's installed I'm not
sure if I want to paint the sides here I
know that's a red lettering and that
doesn't really match anything in the rig
but you're not gonna see that for the
most part because it will be sitting
sideways like that so I think I'm just
gonna stick with painting only this top
bar here so a word on the paint choice
here I've used Plasti Dip in the past I
have several pans just kind of leftover
sitting up here and that's a good choice
primarily because you can remove it
fairly easily but I've since gone with
engine enamel because it does provide a
cleaner finish it's much more smooth and
glossy if you go with Plasti Dip i
recommend something like a glass of fire
that will I guess smooth out that that
final finish that you have it'll look
more reflective than it will matte I
have since switched to engine enamel
just because it does provide an
all-around better finish in my opinion
if you're a fan of matte finishes and go
for the plastidip and if you wanna I
guess correct that you can buy the glass
of fire too I've used both they they
kind of look the same in the end as long
as you apply enough coats but engine
nails we're gonna go with now I'm not
worried about removing this anytime soon
yeah it's raining outside terrible
terrible day to be painting just because
of how much humidity is in the air right
now and we live in Louisiana so it's
pretty much never gonna be good in the
summer but whatever we're gonna paint it
anyway you see people who ever lived in
the year before painted all over
just the straight concrete it's pretty
sad but we'll be a little more
responsible we're gonna paint on top of
this anti crystal box
okay so we've got the four screws
removed and you see how simple this is
here this is just that's just slides
right out just like that so this is the
piece we're gonna be painting all white
and you'll mainly see the top of it
right here now if I really wanted I
could literally just take the support
and paint each side of each of these
modules but I don't think that I want to
paint over this chrome strip here it's
glued on pretty hard so I don't want to
try to pull it off and rip anything and
on top of that it's just gonna look a
little goofy the whole dim just
completely white so that I'm nice to
have some black accents in there and for
the most part you won't see this just
because it's so low on the montreux to
be really close to everything else on
the board alright first thing you want
to do is shake the pan a lot
okay terribly hard to see out here but
that is the this is the finished product
and their little stuff yeah oh yeah
that's what happens when you let paint
dry upside down
well from the top they don't look bad
yeah it's good enough
you
okay so we have the power supply 1,000
watts from deep cool and we have thirty
two hundred megahertz ddr4 16 gigs of it
from a pacer that's a that's pretty much
it for now that I'm the tell them to do
for Walter White I do have one more
piece to the puzzle that's not here yet
when it is here I'll do a whole separate
video on that and the result of
including that one piece in terms of
benchmarks think you know what it's
gonna be that's right a second graphics
card at second gtx 1070 we're gonna see
if it's really worth
especially on a z170 platform upgrading
to 210 70's versus just one what kind of
benefits you should expect to see if you
decide to sli to brand new Pascal GPUs
other than that be sure to give this
video a thumbs up if you thought it was
cool give it a thumbs down if you feel
to quit upset or if you hate everything
a lot be sure to click Subscribe but if
you haven't gonna stay tuned for more
interesting content torque for the CPU
core series and a brand new ITX pc build
your Paulo PC sometime tomorrow
this is science to do thanks for
