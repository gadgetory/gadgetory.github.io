you haven't already seen part one of the
PC gaming series be sure to check that
out before you see part 2 okay with that
out of the way let's dive into the
Golden Age of video gaming or as I like
to personally call it the Golden Age of
PC gaming ranging from around 1980 to
the year 2000 the 1980s were a grand
time not only for video games but for
personal computer enthusiasts systems
such as the Commodore 64 and vic-20 were
making their way into the markets and
were relatively affordable the 64 was a
special computer as it allowed gamers to
take advantage of the same controllers
used by the Atari 2600 and others yes
joysticks controllers and other
handhelds were still very possible for
computers even in the 1980s the Apple 2
was a big hit and the high-resolution
Macintosh was just entering the market
although it did prove to be less
successful the Amiga lineup featured the
first 16-bit computer with a custom
Motorola chipset onboard sound and
integrated graphics that were unrivaled
at the time all of this I should mention
occurred during the same decade so what
about games let's kick things off with
one I know you're all familiar with and
that's pac-man a PC port in 1982 the
game was designed by a team of nine
people and became one of the greatest
video game hits of all time not just in
the arcade but on the PC most people
don't know that you could actually play
pac-man on an early 80s computer the
game of Donkey Kong was ported to the PC
in 1983 no further description needed
and at around this time the famous game
of Frogger was also released in which a
helpless frog was making across a
ridiculous amount of traffic instant
classic that one online gaming became a
thing in the 80s as well with games like
Snipes seizing a great deal of attention
from those who were packing identical
network drives the game itself was
centered around the idea of Search and
Destroy which you can also find in
modern games like Call of Duty I can't
make an 80s gaming video without
mentioning the Legend of Zelda which was
released in 1986 as well as outrun the
classic racing game that always featured
the newest and hottest Ferraris of the
era the first of the sid meier series
games that is those with his name in the
title named pirates was released in 1987
at this point in game graphics started
to take off as computer hardware became
cheap and powerful a very paradoxical
combination simcity now referred to as
Sim City classic was released in 1989
and marked the start of many successful
sim games in which the player ultimately
controls what happens and what goes
where my personal favorite was SimCity 4
but we've got a while to go before that
game shows up on our list by the turn of
the decade gaming potential took a
drastic turn in the right direction with
the introduction of independent graphics
accelerators better known today as video
or graphics cards these contain
independent processors dedicated
specifically to video output and
included rendering cores and dedicated
video memory
apart from system RAM these dedicated
video cards took a significant load off
of the CPU and allowed for large chunks
of data to be processed and rendered
simultaneously IBM's very first card
known as the monochrome display adapter
it was nothing like this however and
instead only carry the potential of
displaying text characters and unique
fashions and at a very low theoretical
resolution of only 720 by 350 and while
relatively unimpressive on its own the
MDA definitely paved the way for 3d
graphics taken for granted today
three-dimensional graphical interfaces
allow for the development of
first-person shooters of which Doom is a
noteworthy implementation the game was
originally released for the personal
computer under IBM's rebranded ms-dos
operating system doom was played by an
estimated 20 million people worldwide
within the first two years of its
release and was succeeded by doom 2 in
1994 it was because of games like doom
and mortal kombat that the interactive
digital software association began
raiding games under the ESRB needless to
say doom was not rated E for Everyone
Resident Evil was released and ported to
the PC in 96 and marked one of the first
successful horror style games have you
seen the movies then you know exactly
what I'm talking about in the same year
the first actually affordable graphics
card was released by 3d FX interactive
and allowed PC gamers to expand their PC
gaming horizons quake was released in
1996 and became the pioneer of the
online first-person shooter experience
as the internet became much more
mainstream it became a staple for PC
gamers the game unreal became a clear
indication that modern multiplayer
first-person shooters on the PC were
here to stay in 1997 Carmageddon was
released and became an icon simply for
its gruesome nature and ferocious gory
attitude a trend that many videogames
were following at the time
I'm throwing this one into the video
because it was so controversial in so
many countries including the United
Kingdom which for a short amount of time
refused to certify the game until all of
the blood in the game's code was removed
the BBFC later backed down from the
stands and certified the original
version in other countries including
Brazil the game was outright banned
altogether no exceptions
yeah all in this segment of the PC
gaming series for the game that I'm sure
most if not all of you have heard of and
that's counter-strike back to
first-person shooters this game possibly
took it all to the max in the year 2000
it allowed for indefinite customization
competition and gameplay with various
modes guns and maps to choose from well
enough Maps to keep one occupied for a
good while at least counter-strike also
signifies an interesting turn and PC
gaming especially as it in its own right
is essentially a mod that is a
modification from an original game
half-life counter-strike mods were
particularly unique to PC gaming
exceptions being some game sharks and
those who could modify cd-rom code which
was much harder to do needless to say PC
gamers had the joys of most released
video games in general regardless of the
games intended platform thanks to savvy
coders a bit of illegal mischief and a
very strong passionate thriving PC
gaming community if you liked what you
saw in part 2 of the series be sure to
give this video a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down a feel the complete opposite
or if you hate everything about life yes
I'm giving you that option now be sure

haven't already stay tuned for multiple
PC builds here on the channel that will
take place in the coming weeks
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us oh and stay tuned for
part three</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
