tons of compressed air for four books
boy clean your PC even Gus
oh I usually end up selling my PC before
they get dusty I just I just cycle
through him super quick 60-inch for 678
looks like all the good TV deals are
long gone I've been talking to my dad
about curved TVs and I don't know if
he's on board with the whole I don't
know captivating immersive experience I
personally don't see much of a
difference it past a certain point it's
really not going to make any difference
at all and from the side you're gonna
have a weird warped image you know
especially if you have a really wide
living room and people from you know
fairly sharp angles are trying to watch
the TV I just I think it's more like a
marketing stunt to be completely honest
with you now for gaming monitors I think
there there is a case for it because
you're so close right so you turn left
you turn right your Center your pivot
point is your head of course and as you
rotate that screen is the same distance
away from your head no matter where
you're looking on the screen that's the
point of a curved monitor but curved TV
you don't get that same experience 130
bucks for a 24 inch IPS display io c HP
27-inch 179 these aren't really epic at
all if you look right here clearly
gaming PC's ready to go vr ready
hook these up to any oculus rift or HTC
vive and you'll be a good to go at your
15 to 20 fps in 720p I just spit right
at the camera did you see that this
looks like a beast just a beef hot
desert antenna it's the same one we saw
at Best Buy for 130 really high in 30
bucks was it there this is the 1900
the on 5 the galaxy on 5 4 3 2 looks
like this one that's a TFT display back
in good old days
oh yeah I was cycling through so many
phones on Craigslist like I was the
cellphone trader here in Panama City
that was my hobby and yeah literally I
mean now that was like the point I
didn't really do for the money didn't
make I didn't make much money on each
sale but I got to try out new phones and
I worked my way up I started with like a
Infuse 4G ended up with a galaxy s4 and
then I mean that was like a year later
like you know but starting with
something that really wasn't that
expensive and ending up with a decent
phone for the time it's pretty cool what
is this look at big they're getting are
these are the buttons it clicks they're
getting so creative they're trying so
hard to stand out from the other
Bluetooth speakers in the arena
I can just reach my hand into this
screen don't do that for real but yeah I
could
that's all it's got to be Oh lid it's
not all that it's not no pet peeve of
mine okay I know this is targeted toward
the consumer that really doesn't care as
much about specs as maybe you and I do
but when they say Intel Core i7 and
that's it I want to know okay what kind
of core i7 it is is it a 6700 HQ or at
6500 you it's a big difference between
those two that can really sway the price
of the product in general oh I guess we
could guess we could check on the laptop
yeah didn't really think about that
let's see I got money on the 6500 you
that's what I'm thinking 6500 you yeah I
mean this wouldn't have was a 13-inch
yeah this wouldn't have a 6 7 or HQ in
it anyway but it's still good too you
know these kinds of things should be
advertised and they're kind of
submissive about it
laptop selections a little dry I just
want to wait in those lines like if I
have to wait line for food on Black
Friday it's still not Black Friday yet
by the way we've been shopping for 4
hours and it's still Thursday in the
vicinity of the store there's not a
single parking spot I'm fairly certain
on me anything to the left no wait what
about back here yeah we'll just let's go
out there camp there's no way it is over
here
we're in the boonies and we still can't
find a spot very okay yeah I'm getting a
phone so when we walk in the store
double check on the lens make sure it's
not super foggy I don't think it is but
just to make sure
yeah that's I'm not sure cuz it's pretty
humid out here even though it's November
24th before yeah this is hot groceries
like normal people like on vicodin
she's got like eggs and milk and lovely
I hate crowds you know that's like one
of the few scenarios in which I'm okay
with compromising my own personal space
for the sake of enjoying beautiful music
oh they got TVs they're wearable tech on
the far side but I don't know the making
everything in lines we can't even go
where we need to go this is ridiculous
it was just like the Bible of Skyrim
basically they even have like in-game
snapshots so you know exactly what
you're doing you see that do you see how
chaotic it is how do you go around it I
just said that how do you go around and
get one I just said that like bro I need
stuff that you're blocking me from
getting we can't even get to the good
stuff
in target because it's blocked dude that
was chaotic I'm pretty sure they didn't
have any like killer deals anyway but
the fact that I couldn't even walk into
the electronics section they have long
lines for pretzels here in Target
yeah that's yeah it's pretty long lunch
just go to Pierre Park that was
extremely crowded target target who
woulda thought target would have been
like the most crowded so far more
crowded than Best Buy I had a more
enjoyable experience just walking around
in vest by where did the park
it was like somewhere over here some
orange oh yeah we all right there
so that's where we'll go now check out
TV deals and then on our way
they'll be on our way to Pierre Park out
on the beach and we'll just walk through
Pierre Park I don't know if we're gonna
find any parking near Pierre Park but
yeah so probably not no politics on
Salazar studio you know I first started
science studio Mac night was called that
I used the camera that was like
identical to this yeah I think it's
called like the L 320 or something but
it was red just like just one of us yeah
the bitrate was appalling
I think the quality was just terrible I
sold it
told her not to use it for video see
what your headphone prices look like
drew is that a good price no no I don't
know right they are they 300 usually for
the beat so - so they're always $1.99
can't range one another thing the studio
ones are the solos oh wait these are the
Best Buy these are the ones they're $100
each I cannot tell you how many emails a
day I get from companies wanting me to
review their Bluetooth speakers I'm
telling you like at least two or three a
day I just don't respond to him anymore
I can't I cannot sift through that many
Bluetooth speaker emails but you're
looking for one or multiple Bluetooth
speakers you can find them here
welcome to Pierre Park
it's actually fairly alive at this point
even though it's 8:30 holiday I don't
know what we're going to find here we're
just going to walk around enjoy the
atmosphere show you guys around this is
Panama City Beach kind of the icon of
Panama City Beach when you come here you
have to come to Pier Park there's like
nothing here to look at tech was there
no you have to go to Best Buy really did
it's really crowded and all the stuff we
looking at and one more tube is fine
Walmart
yeah Walmart was your target was Jang
they walk into market block off the
entire electronic section and like made
it an aisle for people to like stand in
line I do you know what we could do take
a step inside JC pink know what why not
just go inside JC Penney just like
normal like two guys walk into JC Penney
it's like cool just keep your distance
thing just keep your distance it's like
30 feet no idea what we're doing in here
no idea oh I am so out of my element
right now it's like I'm gravitating
towards the electronic section they
don't have one here and this will let
you overclock your PC yeah you know what
we could try oh using lipstick as a
thermal compound isn't pink oh I'm gonna
owe ya I may get my mom to hook me up oh
it's gonna be an awkward conversation
mom kind of awesome lipstick it's for a
computer bill someone's trying to steal
something Oh
someone tried to steal something again
and again and
don't break the bank yeah or like what
I've going on Quora ah see see see what
that's what I was afraid of feel like
this is the only uh like the only place
I've ever gone would it like where I
would have bought something I also
wonder how many stores policies we
violated by filming in them forever 21
it's too late for me it's too late Oh
what if I walked in the store and just
legit like as like every employee I
could find like hey I'm 22 but can I
still shop here excuse me I'm being
blinded by my headlight I'm sitting here
how hey JJ hey buddy what's up I didn't
buy anything at Black Friday because I
just no no true it wasn't really all
that great huh like I think the selling
point this year was TVs I think 4k TVs
were like the hot thing and those sold
out instantly I had to be in line two or
three hours prior to the store opening
to get those and everything else was
just kind of mediocre they weren't any
killer deals on like GoPros or cameras
that I was interested in so I think what
we're going to do again this is going to
be titled
Black Friday shenanigans we're just
going to do another one of these for
Cyber Monday just call it cyber monday
shenanigans and I'll just be online
pretty much all day looking for some
pretty killer deals on primarily Amazon
and Newegg if you like this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you do feel like we'd
opposite or if you hate everything about
life be sure to click the subscribe
button if you haven't already
stay tuned for cyber monday shenanigans
this is Salazar studio thanks drew for
being the cameraman today ro thanks for
following us around Panama City</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
