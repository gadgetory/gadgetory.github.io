the be quiet sweet Caesars Palace in Las
Vegas for CES 2018 we've got two super
cool new coolers with improved mounting
systems that I want to talk about here
also improve TD peace but the regular
dark rod for so this is the fourth
series of the dark ROC coolers that you
can buy this one's massive I've actually
featured the dark ROC 3 variant of this
cooler in the past this is a 250 watt
TDP cooler with the nice aluminum shroud
on top and the improved mounting system
I was talking about a bit earlier you
can actually unscrew the two caps here
in the top middle and then you get an
included be quiet Phillips head
screwdriver with an extension there if
you can push it all the way down to the
mounting bracket which we'll show in a
second and the mounting bracket only
consists of two Phillips head screws so
much better than how it used to be
having to squeeze that little wrench way
down in there torque this was very
difficult to do so now having two screws
as vastly expedited the process meaning
that you can stick one of these on your
system in a matter of minutes and I'll
be sure to test that out myself once we
can get our hands on this particular
unit I love how big and beefy this is
and how beautiful it looks from the top
now the dark rock 4 which is the younger
brother of the dark rock pro 4 pretty
much boasts all the things that it's
bigger brother does have on board you
have that way fan design to keep things
nice and quiet you got the intentions on
the bottom to increase surface area to
allow heat to be dispersed much more
efficiently than if you had just a flat
design and this one has six six heat
pipes instead of seven but you still
managed to pull out a 200 watt TDP with
this cooler and a single silent wings 3
135 millimeter fan included so are
pretty impressive for what you're
getting here and this one does not have
any ramp clearance issues one thing I do
want to note regarding the pro 4 is we
have a little indention on this side and
on this side depending on which way you
want to flip it really doesn't matter
and this is good for ram that's a bit
more ostentatious so maybe Triton's
dd-dear for some really large Corsair
modules maybe all of that should have
much more breathing room at least here
with that small intention which make a
big difference if you have any sort of
RGB lighting or accident
that make it a bit larger than normal I
always have a lot of fun utilizing be
quite components check out this build
right here by the way if you haven't
already this is a super silent build
using primarily be quiet components I
don't know what wills doing but he's
yeah it's right right there I've got
multiple all right awesome
I can't waiting my hands on this thing
here I appreciate Chris and the others
hooking us up and allowing us to tour
their suite for CES 2018 stay tuned for
more content it's a science studio
thanks for touring with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
