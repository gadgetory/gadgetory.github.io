see in frames per second but the
question itself has to do more with the
human brain than it does the eye
whereas cameras stitched together X
amount of frames and strain information
based on individual still images the
human eye perceives and translates
reality at a constant and uninterrupted
rate what we do know is that the
figurative iam and I can be trained to
perceive extra information in said
additional frames but the opposite is
also true try out this test what you're
about to see is 30 seconds of
alternating red and blue dots the rate
at which of these dots alternate will
depend largely on the speed to which you
set this video so when you see the
countdown I'm about to show if you're on
a computer click the Settings icon below
this frame and then change the speed two
times to if you're already playing this
video at 720p or 1080p the video should
be at 60fps if we multiply that speed by
2 which should simulate sort of
depending on how YouTube compresses this
video 120 frames per second are you
ready here we go
now depending on how trained your eyes
are you either saw clear and distinct
changes between red and blue shades of
the dot or you saw a constant stream of
just a purple shade while at times to
speed if that was the case and I suggest
lowering that speed to 1.5 times maybe 1
times until you can see that distinct
change between the colors that will give
you and of a relative comparison between
your eyes ability to discern frames and
someone else's now I know a bunch of you
are eager to jump into the comments and
declare I saw both red and blue but be
honest with yourself and regardless this
still proves a point some of your brains
blended both colors and some of yours
didn't is it's the former then it proves
that the human eye doesn't see in frames
you see even if in this case you were
able to discern the individual colors at
120 hypothetical frames per second at
some point let's say a thousand fps just
for the heck of it those frames would
just blend together essentially into one
solid color red and blue make purple
that's all the proof we need about the
human eye cognition and frame rates if
we did see in frames per second and then
our brains would systematically select
specific frames to extract from the test
in which case no blending would occur
think of it the same way a monitor
reacts to a graphics card if the card is
processing and sending 120 frames to the
monitor in question which itself is only
refreshing 60 times a second ie 60 Hertz
then the monitor will extract 1 out of
every 2 frames that received to display
on-screen that selection process depends
largely on the monitor the sync tactic
in question topics unrelated to this one
but if our eyes and brains did the same
thing we wouldn't see a blending of
images rather much like monitors we'd
experience tearing and infrequent gaps
in visual data which wouldn't serve any
real-world purpose in fact it would hurt
us so it's safe to assume it as we
developed as a species our brains were
trained to perceive fast-moving objects
and not just blur them out it would be
weird to see on a leopard kind of just
frame by frame moving across our field
of view that would serve no evolutionary
purpose whatsoever but our bodies have
adapted in other ways as well while we
ourselves may not typically move very
fast our heads can twist on a dime and
our eyes have adjusted accordingly don't
give yourself whiplash but swing your
head from one side to the other
did you do it he didn't do it I'm really
stupid up here during this interval your
eyes likely locked unto two distinct
points where you were looking before you
swung your head and where you were
looking immediately after it stopped
swinging our eyes tend to do this
subconsciously and for a good reason
keeps us from getting dizzy but if we
roll their eyes back and forth very
quickly without moving our heads the
space in between remains in our
peripherals which is kind of
counterintuitive because our eyes are
moving across that central plane at some
point our brains here are doing us a
solid but do not mistake this for frame
skipping nervous impulses coming to and
from our occipital lobes are not being
interrupted rather our brains are
replacing those quick flashes of blur
with what we see just before and just
after the swing of our eyes it's called
saccadic masking and it's brilliant
devolution so when it comes to the frame
rate you see when gaming asking how many
frames can my eye see is the wrong
question of course by that definition we
can see an infinite number of frames
photons are not being interrupted as I
enter our optical nerves our optical
nerves themselves are sending
information and constant and
uninterrupted pulses as well so there's
no break up and the data transfer
instead here's the question you should
be asking at what point is my brain no
longer fooled by the frame rate you see
FPS perception depends on a few factors
object motion is a big 112 fps that's
pretty low rate will look pretty damn
smooth at the object we're talking about
is a snail or extremely viscous lava you
get the point this is why some sports
and action movie channels will opt for
720p at 60 FPS versus 1080p at 30
fast-moving objects benefit from a
higher frame rate there's really nothing
to argue about here and that's why it
makes sense and is such a big deal in
the gaming industry particularly in
first-person shooters a higher frame
rate gives the added benefit of smoother
and more accurate turns and twists among
other things and the added realism in
motion allows our brains to focus on the
more important task at hand you guys
know what I'm talking about if you don't
believe me try gaming at 120 FPS and
then immediately jump back to 30 fps you
will wish you hadn't without a doubt the
differences between 30 60 and 120 FPS
are apparent
do not let a console gamer tell you
otherwise but as the frame rate
continues to double our ability to
discern weekends for in two
this year 30 and 60 FPS movement is
rather apparent assuming YouTube
compression hasn't watched the 2 by this
point but in the case of 60 to 120 fps
even though double the frames have been
added to this round instead of 30 to 60
which is only a 30 Delta it's 60 to 120
which is a 60 Delta the differences are
subdued and 120 to 240 this is the same
story only intensified but let's shift
positions here for a second I really
like studying brainwave activity how
that effects are a visual auditory just
natural perception of reality and
several studies have been conducted and
an effort to explain these cognitive
phenomena one of my favorite involves
electroencephalography EEG to monitor
brainwave stimuli from the occipital
lobe
since optical nerves are a part of the
central nervous system their electrical
impulses can be charted as functions of
frequency various testing methodologies
resulted in peak beta wave it's waves of
normal human consciousness responses
corresponding to a range of roughly 25
to 60 fps and this assumes outside
stimuli are suppressed but when physical
activity Rises for example if you go for
a run this frequency increases resulting
in a heightened sense of awareness and
perception you can actually feel this
change by the way pick a song that's
pretty upbeat an X along actually works
listen to the song when you're at rest
when alpha waves operating between 7 and
13 pulses become prevalent in the brain
best to do this part right after you
wake up then try your best to compare
that rhythm to the same rhythm after a
long exhausting workout chances are that
upbeat quality will now feel a bit
slower as though the song has been
dragged out a bit longer individual
beats are easier to discern and suddenly
nothing in the song seems to be moving
very fast there's your cue you've just
effectively increased your brain's
sampling rate the rate at which your
brain processes information so human
cognition is largely dependent on
outside stimuli and while competitive
first-person shooters are without a
doubt intensive physical exhaustion is
usually a non-issue though I have seen a
few sweat in the heat of battle thus
lower frame rates aren't as apparent
however and I personally vouch for the
science by the way do something that's
exhaustive run a mile and I'll do some
jumping jacks whatever gets your heart
rate up whatever gets the blood flowing
through your brain faster and then jump
back into the
game again I'm willing to bet that
you'll notice the subtle differences in
frame rates beta levels peak perception
becomes especially sensitive and subtle
changes in everything from simple
rhythms to time gaps between artificial
frames become more apparent but remember
it's not because we can see in frames
per second we aren't designed that way
want more proof and grab a strobe light
that will drive you crazy
our brains are difficult to fool
especially when our senses are
heightened and depending on how trained
yours is a higher end game framerate may
be necessary to keep it fooled now at
this point if you're still watching the
video I want to emphasize that much of
what we've talked about here is not
definitive science there is still so
much we do not understand about how the
brain perceives reality in fact you'll
need several optometrists and
neurologists who will debate three years
about what we've just talked about
because there's still so much we do not
know it is still cool to talk about
however because a lot of it has to do
with what we see on our monitors when
we're playing video games it's actually
pretty cool how that stuff tends to
overlap with stuff in the tech industry
if you liked this video be sure to give
it a thumbs up thumbs down for the
opposite click and subscribe but if you
haven't already and I will catch you in
the next video this is science studio
