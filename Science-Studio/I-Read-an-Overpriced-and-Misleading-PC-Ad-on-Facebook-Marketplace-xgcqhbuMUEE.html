and I want you to decide for yourself
really what you think about this ad
before you hear what I have to say about
it because you know that most of these
are gonna be pretty bad but I just you
know look at the price and then kind of
break down the parts in your head as I
read through them and then decide for
yourself if this is something you would
entertain at all maybe you would counter
at the lower price what have you just
let me know in the comment section below
before you hear what I have to say
because I'm curious to see if we think
alike or not
so 850 bucks for this case it's actually
full on PC I should say and it starts
off with gaming desktop computer , with
red comma LED lighting and a front temp
sensor can play most games at high
settings has no issues and keeps a good
temperature even while running for long
periods of time mid tower computer has
an open above door that gives access to
six customizable addit on slots as well
as a vent has a see-through sidewall so
I have a few qualms with this off the
bat I want you guys again to comment
down below what you think first off
maybe you completely disagree with me on
this and that's perfectly fine we can
have disagreements we can completely
disagree about what we think use parts
are worth look you know the price of an
object is in the eye of the purchaser
you know if you if you see the utility
in spending 200 bucks on an item I only
see a hundred bucks utility in then go
ahead and pay 200 bucks for it that's
totally fine you know if it's worth it
to you buy it I'm not gonna knock on you
for that but when people blatantly
overpriced products or when people
blatantly mislead you or attempt to do
so I'm going to probably make a video
about it and if I don't make a video
about it I will post it to social media
and just not not to bash the seller
because I'm gonna do my best here to
keep the sellers info concealed at least
on YouTube I usually just share the link
on Twitter when I'm sharing up with
people who follow me on Twitter but this
is more or less to give you guys the
inside scoop as to how I deal with used
parts when I buy and sell online I do it
all the time via Craigslist Amazon eBay
it's something that I enjoy doing and I
want to just kind of fill you guys in
with how I
negotiate rationalize parts especially
use part it's kind of hard to put prices
on used components so right off the bat
an or 50 bucks
I'm just thinking in my head right here
he's asking way too much and we're gonna
go ahead and break down the prices of
each component now and see how far off
the mark we actually are so we're gonna
start first with the power supply here
725 watt this don't believe has an
eighty plus rating I've owned this exact
power supply I think it was from our
brand that originally was called senti
this is not a very reputable power
supply it actually runs quite loud you
will hear the power supply fan just you
know when you're playing games what have
you which isn't a full load by the way
right so games are gonna utilize maybe
half to three-quarters of your full CP
utilization or some of you have a decent
CPU know and then the graphics card to
be ramped up pretty high but total
system power draw when you're playing
games isn't gonna be as high as it would
under static illimitable usage so just
you know it's something that to take
home here is that the power supply is
not a good one it will be loud and it's
not very efficient on top of that he has
eight gigs of Crucial Ballistix sport
ram look i'm not gonna knock him on the
ram eight gigs is really fine for a you
system
I recommend eventually upgrade to
sixteen but it's not really gonna hit
you that hard especially when you're
pairing eight gigs of system ram with a
four gig GT 730 what you're gonna get to
next so this v-max GeForce GT 734 gig
card here this is what he is claiming
supposedly does a high settings in most
games and I'm here to tell you folks
that's not true unless you're playing it
like the 480p resolution
maybe 720p but I would say most games
overlaps with some titles that
definitely wouldn't run at high settings
as low as 720p and I have first-hand
experience again with the GT 730 I'm not
making this up folks I've benchmarked
this exact card I've actually kind of
made fun of it and compared it to a
really expensive card I think in one
video so yeah this card is not something
that you just throw into a system really
alright check out my sweet system it's
more of a budget option and that's okay
right we don't expect most people to be
able to do out there and drop 500 bucks
on the graphics card but it's not
something to really brag about and say
yeah like I said check out my 7:30 so
he's trying to upsell it I think he's
trying to make it seem like it's a more
powerful card than it is and to the
layman someone who's never seen the PC
like this at least the inside of one
doesn't know the specs and what
specs are capable of outputting in terms
of FPS that person might be mislead so
when he says here I'm assuming it's a
guy that you can play games at high
settings quote-unquote I'm more or less
just kind of how dare you you know like
why are you trying to persuade people
that this system is more powerful than
it actually is because anybody who knows
anything about these graphics cards
knows that the 730 isn't anywhere close
to what you'll need to play and let's
say 1080p which is the most common
gaming resolution out there by far
according to Steam surveys nowhere close
to that high settings in 1080p unless
you're playing like a super old game
like The Sims which ok fine maybe a 730
is good for that now I'm not sure if
this person just can't spell there are
plenty of typos and you're pretty
obvious ones but on top of that it just
almost seems so blatant that he's
intentionally misspelled something he
just doesn't care about what he's
selling and that's a red flag for
anybody looking to buy something from a
seller try to make sure they at least
know what they're selling
otherwise you might be suckered into
buying something that is probably not
what it seems on paper or at least in
the pictures
so in zkt that's not a company that
exists that I know of it's NZXT this
case is from a reputable company do them
a solid and at least spell their name
right let's see here's a double D blue
one terabyte hard drive he misspelled
hard drive whatever he has an MSI 970 a
motherboard and he actually had the
audacity to say aftermarket processor
fan with AMD FX 6300 and of course it's
gonna pitch the fact that it's a
six-course cpu even though the way aim
he did this it's not really a 6 core CPU
in terms of what utilizes what what
resources are available to each core
there we have a video on this by the way
if you're more interested but that aside
this aftermarket quote unquote cooler
that he's sporting here is as stock as
anything if it's aftermarket then it's
literally a replica the stock fan that's
included in the CPU case so yeah you're
gonna you're not gonna have a fun time
overclocking the system at all and not
the CPU and if you even care to
overclock the GP I'm not sure how that
would go why there but it looks like
this is a pretty small form factor in GT
730 the aftermarket processing cooler
whatever he's calling Africa processor
fan and that's
so is the fan aftermarket is a whole
cooler aftermarket it just doesn't look
good it looks really fishy and it looks
just bare-bones so he's trying to upsell
right and aftermarket cooler but I don't
think it's one so and then one internal
back mounted fan I don't know where it
is in the pictures maybe it's further
back but nonetheless doesn't change my
mind the system looks ok I mean it's not
a pretty system by any means but it's
definitely overpriced so here the parts
725 watt power supply I would say
between 30 and 40 bucks 8 gigs of ddr3
we're just gonna say 60 bucks this is
all used by the way I'm just kind of
throwing these parts out here so we're
at $100 total now for the RAM and the
PSU a GT 730 let's just look that up
right now it looks like these are going
anywhere between 50 and 90 dollars the
four gig ones are a bit more expensive
as you've probably assumed so let's just
say use 60 bucks so we're at a hundred
and sixty dollars and now we have a case
from NZXT it's a it's a rather old case
actually look for this for one my first
PC builds ever in The Guardian and we're
just gonna say 20 bucks it's pretty
cheap pretty old so we are at what now
one hundred and eighty dollars one
terabyte WD blue hard drive it's used so
taking that into account let's say 30
bucks it's given 25 percent off so 30
bucks plus $180 210 bucks and then we
have the FX 6300 with the motherboard so
this is where it's gonna be pretty
subjective I wouldn't pay any more than
20 bucks for an FX 6300 and yeah that's
probably pushing it in my book still
because Verizon 3 is such a good value
right now and that motherboard may be 40
bucks so 60 bucks for the CPU and
motherboard that comes out - what are we
at now 180 210 270 or so USD and let's
throw 10 bucks in for an extra fan just
because I feel pretty sorry for the
price at this point yeah the system is
pretty cheap and he's trying to sell it
like it's just a really expensive system
so if you again know anything about used
parts do ten seconds worth of research
on a used site like eBay where
everyone's trying to sell everything
especially graphics cards right now
you'll know after just 10 seconds like I
said that the
system is severely overpriced it's not
even like remotely overpriced like it's
so high this guy probably thinks to
himself you can get somewhere close to
eight fifty four right so when you
lowball in which our version of a
lowball is actually gonna be justified
because you can build a system used for
considerably cheaper than what he's
asking for it he's gonna think that
you're just being a jerk and asking way
lower than you should so people like
this with this kind of like complex
where they think that they're right and
they think that the price is justified
are never gonna understand why you would
offer 300 bucks for this switch that's
that's pushing it so again I want to
reiterate the fact that you might not
agree with the way I've broken down the
price here you might not think this
guy's being misleading you might just
think he's a genuine guy trying to make
a quick buck and whatever that that's
that's beside the point what I want you
to take away from this is that if you
wanted to do this yourself you could do
it for a lot less you don't have to deal
with somebody like this trying to
mislead you and sucker you into thinking
you have a really good system when you
actually don't and this is why knowledge
is I mean they call it knowledge right
Tai Lopez you guys but the reason why
knowing this stuff upfront is important
because you know what you're actually
buying you know what your money is worth
and what you can get for your money and
when you decide to spend a turn fifty
bucks on a system like this you're just
throwing money away literally you're
giving it as somebody's gonna be
irresponsible with it more than likely
so look don't jump on you know Facebook
or whatever and harass this guy if you
do find him I don't want that if some of
these videos are meant to do I don't
want to incite violence or have you guys
threaten this guy or just give him a
hard time that's not what this video is
about it's about you guys learning how
to deal with but just ads like this
online you just ignore them usually but
you know if you find that someone's
asking more than you think it's worth
don't be afraid to throw a price out
there that you'd be willing to pay for
the product if it's insulting to the guy
then don't worry about it move on you
know there's there's nothing wrong with
asking lower than what somebody wants
for a product on a site like Facebook
marketplace or Craigslist the longer
you're not absolutely lowball on the guy
just to take advantage of them so to
keep things short and sweet I'm gonna
hear from all of you in the comment
section below
again if you disagree with me especially
let's duke it out down there give this
video a thumbs up you got us cool thumbs
down for the opposite or if you hate
everything about life that's right folks
it is a back should click that red
subscribe and if you haven't already and
stay tuned for more content like this
