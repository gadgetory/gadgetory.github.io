only for gamers but also content
creators and just heavy multitaskers in
general most of us assume that the more
expensive chips yield scaled
improvements all around for example the
i7 6900 K at 1,000 u.s. dollars must be
at least twice as good as the i7 6700 K
being that it's three times as expensive
but as we've discussed and proven here
on the channel it's not about core count
and it's really not about frequency
either as much as it is about program
optimization you'll see that in these
benchmarks so I 5 verse i7 verse I 7
verse Xeon vs i7 I know that really
doesn't say much but that's why I have
the thumbnail to kind of clarify some
things in particular we'll be comparing
the i-5 6600 K the i7 6700 K the i7
5820k the xeon e5 26:30 v4 and the i7
6900 k each of these CPUs has either a
different core count or hyper-threading
disparity along with the significant
frequency disparity in the case of the
xeon so we've got a little bit of
everything in this video which should
give you a good idea of what's
preferable cores or clocks and whether
or not these CPUs can handle extreme
multitasking and what do I mean by
extreme multitasking how about having a
4k video file rendering in the
background of each of these benchmarks
for each of these CPUs you'll see two
sets of benchmarks one set with the
background rendering and one set without
this way content creators and heavy
multitaskers alike can get a feel for
what kind of CPU they should be after
your are the two platforms here are the
specs of each butter pause because I'm
about to move on the only difference is
the quad channel memory config for the
x99 platform an advantage we'd be stupid
not to utilize although it's not likely
to change many of these results
first up the benchmarks without the
heavy background multitasking Cinebench
r15 is a raw CP horsepower test that
forces each thread to render small
segments of a much larger image
presumably the more cores the better but
frequency also plays a role more cores
equals more tiles rendered
simultaneously but more powerful
individual cores equals quicker tile
rendering here the i7 6900 K won handily
over the 10 cores eon thanks to its
substantially higher clock speed
followed third by the 5820k at twelve
ninety eight this certainly isn't a test
favors non enthusiast platforms the
sixty seven and sixty-six hundred K
skews fall behind here but does this
translate across multiple benchmarks
7-zip seems to think so huge lead again
for the sixty nine hundred K but it's
what we should expect it's an
overclocked eight core one thousand
dollar chip whoop-dee-doo but what about
the 5820k something more in the ballpark
of about three hundred US dollars only a
couple hundred points away from a
processor with four extra cores and
eight extra threads the power of clocks
ladies and gentlemen I must admit the
6700 K also performed admirably here
although I cannot say the same for the
6600 K Geekbench tests multiple facets
of a system and moulds those results
into two different scores the 6700 K
undeniably has the strongest single core
of any CPU currently available and it's
followed not far behind by the 6600 K
our ten core Xeon suffered the most here
and scored just 25 12 no doubt thanks to
its clock speed but what about when it
comes to rendering this is something I
was personally on the lookout for I went
through several CPUs trying to find the
perfect one for Adobe Premiere Pro and
you kind of get a mixed bag here these
numbers are in seconds just divided by
64 minutes the best value in this case
is a bit of a split between the 6700 K
and 5820k both can be purchased for
around three hundred US dollars it
sometimes fluctuates between that and
about three hundred and sixty bucks so
it just comes down to a matter of total
platform cost in which case the 6700 K
takes the cake when it comes to
multitasking however you may want to
rethink that conclusion we'll discuss it
here shortly the Xeon wasn't too bad
considering its frequency but
considering its price it's definitely a
no-go Adobe Premiere isn't a well
optimized platform and the law of
diminishing returns applies in this case
to core count now check out the sixty
nine hundred K only a fifteen percent
decrease in overall rendering time even
though it's price tag is much higher
this goes back to what I said earlier
core count isn't always what you should
be looking for
lastly handbrake which I found to
utilize as many cores as you throw at it
the 6900 k half the 6700 case time good
news considering the latter has half as
many cores and an equivalent clock speed
the Xeon also picked up the slack
despite packing half the overall
frequency of its eight core counterpart
it meant
to convert the file in a respectable
time all the while maintaining much
lower core temperatures now for the
super stress test the colored bars
you're about to see represent the heavy
multitasking workloads in particular a
4k video file being rendered by Adobe
Premiere Pro in the background here we
go
Cinebench huge cuts get used to folks
it's everywhere about 50% for everything
except for the i-5 which had trouble
even loading the program nonetheless it
did finish I'll be it with a score that
could be beaten by a cue 6607 zip wasn't
as bad fair numbers across the board and
even the i-5 managed itself something
I'm not seeing that I did expect however
our marginal increases in multitasking
scores as core count increases I didn't
expect the 6900 case scored a drop by
the degree that it did and the 6700 case
score didn't drop by as much as I
thought that it would let's continue
Geekbench o Geekbench the i-5 just gave
up here it couldn't do it the program
wouldn't respond once the loading screen
popped up and then Adobe Premiere
crashed thankfully the others didn't
have the same fate the 6700 case score
dropped by about 40% 58 20 case 30% and
the 6900 K is 20% the biggest cuts were
felt by the Xeon whose single core
plummeted to a mere twelve hundred and
seventy-five points putting it in line
with processors from the early 2000s
lastly handbrake and again another shock
for the i-5 it managed to open the
program and execute the command but take
its sweet time doing so even the 6700 K
noticeably slowed up just the overall
operating system something I can't say
for the higher core variants it's not
necessarily a reason to opt for X 99 but
does show the advantages of CPUs
containing more than four cores
regardless of clock speed so here is
what you just saw in a nutshell
first up the i-5 6600 K is no good for
anything we just simulated the i7 6700 K
is probably the best bargain for anyone
not concerned with background 4k
rendering or anything of that sort
the 5820k is for the consumer interested
in x99 but not interested in extreme CPU
prices the Xeon is well probably not for
you just a blanket statement there and
the 6900 K is for those interested in
ultra heavy workloads and users whose
programs are optimized for all eight or
ten cores then and only then can a $1000
price tag
be justified purchasing a 6900 k4 adobe
premiere editing and rendering makes
zero sense according to the benchmarks
we just saw same can be said for the
6600 K by the way and using this
particular Xeon for anything other than
a virtual machine hub or server system
is a bit crazy what my person will take
away you ready for this the i7 6700 K is
the best CPU for 99% of you it leaves
the door open to content creation
streaming and even light multitasking it
doesn't require an expensive motherboard
it doesn't require superb cooling it
doesn't have the minor issues that I've
noticed with my x99 systems latency and
infrequent system stalls for those with
x99 systems I imagine you feel some kind
of way right now but the facts speak for
themselves unless you're running some
serious background tasks a 6700 K is
enough SLI and crossfire it's a
different story on that platform but you
can still manage to get by with eight
lanes per card if you can manage an X 29
build for roughly the same price though
go ahead be my guest
but I'm telling you right now once I get
my hands on a 6700 K equivalent from KB
Lake probably the 7700 K I'll be saying
goodbye to my ex 99 platform the
programs I use simply don't take
advantage of extra cores and games
certainly prefer stronger single cores
if you liked this video be sure to give
it a thumbs up give it a thumbs down if
you do feeling good opposite or if you
hate everything about life be sure to
click and subscribe but if you haven't
already and stay tuned for other good
stuff I'm going to be a bit busy this
week with exams but I'll still push out
a video or two I expect sometime maybe
around Tuesday or Wednesday
