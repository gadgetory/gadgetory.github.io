I just purchased it yesterday i know i'm
behind the times and i have heisenberg
right here you can't see him but he's
chillin right they're actually very
quiet two very satisfied with that even
under load you'll see here in a sec you
won't hear anything coming from the blue
yeti just because the PC doesn't get
loud even under full load and
temperatures are still very acceptable
so I am running battlefield one in the
ultra preset you can see all of the
statistics up there the top left so the
FPS counter is right there and then you
can see everything else I have all 12
cpu threads listed so that you can see
how the game utilizes each thread and if
it uses all 12 or not and then GPU one
GPU to usage for some reason saying I
have how many is it 400 and roughly 400
gigabytes of vram I don't know why it's
saying that just ignore that and then
you can see system ram usage down there
at the very bottom so with that I'm
going to just jump straight into
multiplayer gameplay everything else for
the most part is what I need it to be
and we're going to see how well how well
Heisenberg does here all right I have no
idea how to get to a multiplayer there
it is okay team deathmatch I can't hear
anything i turn the speakers off because
obviously the microphone will pick up
everything so yeah I'm going to look
like a total noob and I expect to be
slightly trashed in the comments that's
completely fine remember the purpose of
this video is to demonstrate how well or
not well Heisenberg holds up to
battlefield one in 1440p that's what
we're playing it at by the way it's a
resolution so 1440p see the settings
there on the left it's taking quite a
while to get thrown into a game was
going on oh there we go okay yeah i'm
using a controller you can hate me all
you want what Oh what just happened whoa
whoa okay so I'm getting around a
hundred frames per second and that's an
ultra that's impressive I don't know
what's going on here what just have to
just die let's see are you kidding me oh
come on i fell all right in front of
them see what's up here tell you what
though gameplay overall is very smooth
and very impressed with it I see it kind
of
oh my aim is my aim is crap hey I get
somebody oh yeah I got someone is that
gasps yeah that's gas like mustard gas
come on oh oh what is up what is wrong
with my leg what is going on there is
their friendly fire in this game Wow
textures are very beautiful in this game
look at that grass very fine detail I'm
impressed with that overall as well AHA
I knew it all ah i'm looking through the
ground right now zoro LOL you suck I'm
surprised he's not saying that about me
I was three and seven yes so i'm looking
at cpu usage while we're just kind of
chilling here for a second and it's it's
all over the place but i think every
thread at some point is being utilized
at least fifty percent okay how do I
have there's a sniper yeah Cammy Cammy
like get out of the way Jesus wow so
many people would respond in the same
spot was not a good spot oh come on
how's a quick scope check it out decent
cpu usage both of our graphics cards are
within their safe temperature zones I
would get worried if from behind I would
be worried if those temperatures
exceeded about 80 to 82 see as long as
they say at or under 80 degrees Celsius
I'll be okay with that cpu temperature
60 CE that's more than fine and we're
using about 10 gigabytes of system ram
which means that this is one of those
instances in which you would want to
have more than the typical 8 gigabytes
of system ram for gaming so if you play
a lot of battlefield one and plan to
definitely pick up more than eight gig
16 would be ideal I keep trying to play
this like it's black ops but it's not
it's it's totally different okay there's
a sniper over there i would say
Heisenberg is handling battlefield one
very well no surprise there but I am
glad that we're receiving come on from
behind again ahhh I'm so sick of the
behind the back shots
there we go it's about time no no it's
nothing is hard work up close man I tell
you what yeah oh that was a headshot
come on this crap man come on there's
some junk
hey I've been promoted level one private
gotta start somewhere right what was
that some glitchin far why he's like
what the heck's going on what the heck's
going on you know if I get some of this
game in one word I would say that it's
immersive it's just and frustrating it's
frustrating as well but the whole map is
interactive whereas with black ops
everything's in a you know fixed kind of
state so I can definitely see why a
battlefield is the way of the future
according to many enthusiasts and the
graphics are just top-notch especially
if I have a computer to back up those uh
those in game settings was it a
flamethrower come on what is that I
donate a flamethrower defeat while we
got destroyed I know we did pretty much
everyone on our team was negative so
there's that okay so is this a map in
which I want to be sniper I have no idea
but we'll find out fairly soon oh this
guy is just being we discussed him thank
you for the insight you have a beautiful
username so i can switch teams teams
would be too unbalanced ha yeah i'd be
hurting the other team that's what they
mean by that this is tough and it takes
so long to reload yeah got him got him
hey it's the guy that was talking smack
to oh yeah oh man he just got fried
whoo-hoo-hoo oh oh man look at that
we're almost up to 12 gigabytes of
system ram to run this map in this game
that's so 16 is going to be and even 16
is going to be cutting a close look at
those cpu usages are you seeing that
look at that we're almost up at eighty
ninety percent how do you throw a
grenade oh that's how you're doing okay
oh that was a headshot for sure medic
what is this one seems like a
semi-automatic yep as a semi-automatic
okay let's check the damage seven and on
hey that's not bad 79 considering what I
was last time God that dudes one in ten
yeah he's worse the almighty beam I
would rethink that username a man okay
and last thing I want to do is what is
this it's a campaign yep let's try out
the campaign mode see how our frame rate
differs there even in the loading screen
we're using eight gigs of system ram so
yeah don't buy eight gigs and expect to
have like a fluid solid experience in
battlefield one at this resolution it's
gonna fall in line open their mind nope
not doing that you know if it wasn't for
those little blue dots above every NPC I
would not know who was who I'd be
killing my own people there's a guy oh
yeah I dig it I dig it all right yeah
now this I can do you know from what it
looks like there isn't much of a
difference between online gameplay and
campaign mode frame rates are probably a
bit higher here in campaign but I mean
that's just due to the predictability of
the whole thing but there's a lot of
people so we're getting currently about
a hundred and ten hundred 15 FPS that's
about ten frames per second more than
what we saw online that's to be expected
though you know would be really dope I
could control a tank if I could control
the tank I think I think that would be
the ideal situation here this guy I
don't think knows where he's going
another thing I noticed our GPU usage
has been anywhere from 80 to 90 percent
roughly and that's a good sign so if you
haven't seen my video right which so I
think it's going to be on this side a
pretty know this side yeah if you
haven't seen my cpu vers GPU
bottlenecking video check that out it
will give you a good idea of what is
bottlenecking what in your system so
nothing has been pegged at a hundred
percent for a while and then this is
just oh come on come on how do these
guys just sit there and take bullets
he's not iron man jeez I wonder how
Germans feel playing this game like is
that is that acceptable the fact that
you're killing your own people
technically like is that normal or is I
don't know because I or just like in any
case like you're playing a game in which
you lose the war like does that does
that bother you at all or or do you just
play games in which you win the war I
don't know games like that I just be
kind of strange because most of the
battle games I've ever played are based
on American American wars for wars that
we fought in and we pretty much win all
of those with the exception of the few
we backed out from and I mean that's
just something I guess we take for
granted but if you're in a country where
you lose a war do you do you make games
about that ward you just like ignore
that game when I'm genuinely curious if
there are games like that often well
okay so gameplay overall is a very
enjoyable I love the graphics everything
is beautiful especially in 1440p I
couldn't even imagine in 4k how much
better this game would look granted we
wouldn't be playing it around 100 FPS
but I should just expect I should just
be sitting here so i'm going to call
this one a definite pass for heisenberg
i'm satisfied with roughly 100 frames
per second at Ultra ultra settings we
are playing a droid x 11 I will do a
video in the future on the differences
between dried x 11 and 12 when it comes
to battlefield but for right now I'm
just I was just morbidly curious as to
how the game reacted to this unique
configuration here most people don't
play with two graphics cards and most
people don't have a six core CPU so very
pleased to see the battlefield takes
advantage of all 12 of those threads at
least to some degree and that we're not
experiencing any severe bottleneck on
either end on either our graphics card
end or our CPU end so with that I want
to call it quits before I die any
anymore I just I've been dying so much
recently I don't think I'm getting
anywhere I've been in the same spot for
like the past five minutes so that's it
if you like video be sure to give it a
thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
do feel the opposite and stay tuned for
more more I guess benchmarks of
Heisenberg not just this game here but I
wanted to showcase this game because
it's relatively new what a lot of people
seem to be interested in it so that's it
subscribe if you haven't already stay
tuned for more stuff like this this is
