remember this bill just a couple of
videos ago this is actually Lisa's
custom yellow and black theme to bill
but there's a problem and many of you
pointed this out you were not too
pleased with the yellow coating on this
graphics card now I don't regret
painting this part yellow what I do
regret throw is not painting the rest of
this black and once a few of you started
saying that I started to realize more
and more you know what they're all right
it would look so much better if this
this you know kind of silver metallic
shroud here was painted black to match
the rest of the bill which is
predominantly black and yellow now my
initial thinking was like okay well
there's a tiny sliver of silver in the
cable Mod Pro cables up here and maybe
that could you know set things off but
it doesn't really do that for me and I
completely understand why so many of you
were upset with the graphics card in
particular so what we're gonna do is
actually we're gonna use two different
types of paint here you're wondering
what that meant a light paint is for
bear with me first off though we're
going to use this rest oleum this is
like auto enamel it's a little different
than what we use before but this is
metal and it is supposed to work well
with metal components so we're gonna
paint using this for the outside
perimeter of the card so all the silver
metal you see here will be painted a
gloss black which should you know look
similar to the yellow gloss that we have
around that particular section of the
card but then I want to do something
just a little different and I'm gonna
run test before and after to confirm
this but we're gonna use this for Stoli
a metallic paint here to paint the
heatsink inside behind this little
plastic panel here silver or metallic so
I think that if we invert the colors and
we make the inside silver and the rest
of the card black then it'll fit almost
perfectly with our cable color scheme up
top so yeah to be honest I really don't
know how this is gonna look I think
it'll look better than it already does
but if we are just not pleased with the
end result then I could always just you
know use nail polish remover and just
scrub all this paint off and start from
scratch but I really think that
inverting the colors will do this card
justice because there's too much silver
in it now I totally agree because the
rest of the bill does not have any black
in it so I think inverting the color
it's gonna look really good I'm going to
show you guys step-by-step how to tear
the founders edition card and then talk
about how I paint a little more detail
than I did in the last video involving
this build so let's get started
the Sennheiser PC 37 X is a new take on
gaming headsets prioritizing both a
sleek design and optimal comfort that's
a tricky combo their audio is top-notch
as always that's no surprise but the
microphone here is a thing of a beauty
you're actually listening to it right
now not bad for a plug-and-play headset
click the link in the video description
for more details
all right so what you'll find with these
founders Asian cards they are very well
build they're very happy they're also a
pain to disassemble completely and it's
easy to isolate the the board from the
rest of the cooler but to take apart the
cooler to the extent that we need to to
be able to paint the little heat sink in
here also this silver shroud
is going to require a full teardown and
there are probably 30 or 40 screws to
consider when doing such a thing I had
to do that when I first painted this
part of the shroud here so it's gonna be
time-consuming now but I'll show you
guys step-by-step everything you need to
take care of so the first thing we'll
need to remove is the back plate and you
can see we have tiny screws Phillips
screws all across both back plates I
actually lost a screw here not that it
matters because the card is vertically
mounted and then this groove broke off
so these are actually kind of a pain
depending on how well they're torqued
into the cooler just be very careful
with this make sure that you have an
appropriately sized Phillips head
screwdriver these are very small a lot
smaller than these four here holding the
board in place so I recommend having
something like I fix it kits will be
pretty good for this I have just a
smaller cobalt set and I used the
smallest Phillips head available that's
this one here grips pretty well don't
strip these screws if you do you're
gonna have a terrible time trying to
take this thing apart
and you'll see the backplate comes in
two sections so at once the first
section is removed here toward the right
side of the card just go ahead and set
this to the side
now you're probably wondering why this
is a green piece to be in a darker
typical founder's reference card PCB and
that is because I actually did something
and the during this next step when I was
originally dissecting the card that
killed the board so it wouldn't post the
card would not show up red as anything
and it wouldn't even receive power and I
think it had to do with something I
pulled off the board accidentally when I
was unscrewing these little hexagonal I
mean what you want to call them but
they're screws on one end so you have to
have a tool that either grips completely
around each of these hex heads or you
have to use some sort of like gripping
tool and just untwist it that way that's
what I did because I don't have a hex
tool that untwist this small actually I
do but it's in the garage and I'm a
little lazy so I just used some
needlenose pliers to twist these out but
these actually hold the PCB to the
cooler not just these four Phillips
screws here so you want to remove all of
these this is probably the most intense
part of the disassembly here only
because the tool required is not like
you know it's not a common household
tool and if you do use something like
pliers you want to be very careful not
to Nick any of these smaller resistors
and transistors all across the PCB
that's what I did that's why the other
board died and that's why we're stuck
with an ugly green one now
so once you remove the smaller screws
you have these last four Phillips screws
here with these little Springs
underneath to remove be careful because
the GPU is right between them also we do
have two Phillips screws here on the
rear i/o plate to remove this one here
as well as this one and then the board
should completely detach from the cooler
and now with all screws removed very
carefully remove the PCB from the cooler
try not to bend the board because you
could dislodge things including the GPU
from the board so we're gonna try to
there we go
now there is one connection here between
the cooler and the board and that is for
the fans actually depending on the model
you might have more than one connection
maybe four LEDs I disconnected that
because this cardigan is sitting
vertically I didn't want ugly green
letters here so I just went ahead and
took it out completely and then this one
other connection for the fan will have
to worry about there we go
and now the board is entirely separated
from the cooler so for this next one
you're going to need a 5/64 hex and a
3/32 hex the larger one will be for the
four hex screws the surrounding the
shroud that we just painted and then the
smaller hex screw will be for these four
as well as these screws on the side both
on the top and bottom
all right so here is every piece of a
founders edition gtx 1070 save the PCB
and the backplate and of course the
screws this is everything and you can
see it's quite a bit here most companies
third-party manufacturers at least we
use just a few parts you have one solid
backplate usually one solid front plate
if you will and then two fans well you
can see there's a lot more going on here
so this is the piece we're going to
paint the largest piece we're also going
to paint the backside of this this will
also be black I think I'm going to leave
these silver that'll be nice little trim
pieces they go on the sides and I just
want to have a little bit of silver
still in there and then this is the
basically heatsink this is a big block
here and we're going to clean this up
make sure that you clean your components
before you paint them and then we will
try our best to paint this a smooth
metallic color the first thing you
should do is clean the surface you're
trying to paint it should be a pretty
obvious point here no hair no dust any
of that that gets trapped under the
paint will look terrible in post the
other thing is to make sure that your
environment is sealed I use a box and I
try to paint indoors if possible do it
next to a window so that there aren't
any unwanted fumes stuck in the room
after the fact if you have a fan you can
turn that on don't turn it on high
though because you might blow dust
around while the paint is trying to dry
make sure to shake the spray can
vigorously before you start spraying
have a few test sprays first off to the
side not actually on the objects you can
get used to how intense the spray is
going to be before you actually start
applying the paint
I recommend beginning to spray while
pointing away from the object and then
while spraying swooped over the object
and then stop spraying once your
pointing away from the object on the
other side of it
this will prevent overspray especially
when you begin spraying in the beginning
you might haven't wanted splotches show
up if you start spraying immediately
onto the object
I recommend between four and five coats
for a process like this the application
of course will depend on the object and
how heavy each coat is though in general
I found it around four or five codes is
plenty the more the merrier as long as
it doesn't look like it's just been
dipped in a jar of paint and lastly make
sure that these objects are properly
dried before you begin touching them
with your hand
the paint is not completely dry you will
move the paint around you will have
fingerprints on the object and that will
look terrible in post so please please
please be patient even if you are unsure
of whether or not the paint is dry or
not wait a few more hours that's right I
said hours because some paint will take
quite a while to dry and depending on
the environment if it's very humid
outside very hot that paint may take
even longer to dry all right so it is
like 2:00 in the morning I'm not going
to talk very loud out but you can see
kind of just a test fit here what
everything looks like so far I think I'm
going to put one more coat for the black
shroud on both sides it's kind of a
metallic finish and it actually almost
blends in with the black that was
already on the card and then we have the
course a little plastic piece here that
goes between this shroud and the silver
heatsink
I didn't realize before that the
metallic paint isn't actually engine
enamel but the black paint is so the
fact that I painted the heatsink or the
heat that you know the fins whatever you
want to call this with a paint that's
actually not thermally conductive might
impact our temperatures a bit more than
I thought so we'll have to see the worst
case you learn from my mistakes you get
the metallic paint that is a engine and
my usually has a little ceramic bits in
it and the ceramic fits conduct the heat
and allow it to transfer nearly
seamlessly through the paint itself from
the metal underneath to the air so it's
just something I didn't realize until
now probably should have looked at that
beforehand but I'm not too concerned I
don't think this paint is gonna you know
absolutely toast the heatsink I just
think it would have been a better choice
to go with engine enamel like the black
paint for the metallic stuff so for now
we're gonna let this dry again I'm gonna
apply one more coat of paint before I
sleep and then tomorrow morning we'll
kick things off and hopefully have a
finished product
all right and I think I am happy with
this this is day two painting usually
requires two days I recommend you let
the paint sit for approximately 24 hours
even though it says that it'll be good
within usually an hour or so just
because you know when you touch the
paint when it's not totally dry you can
get fingerprints you can actually remove
paint just by kind of smudging it and
that is a result of it not being totally
set in to whatever you're trying to
paint but this this paint here is
specifically for metal components and
that's why it bonded so well I believe
the same thing over here is the case but
nonetheless we're going to go ahead and
reinstall these pieces now with the
black shroud that we just painted as
well as the silver heatsink underneath
we're gonna check thermals on this bad
boy see how bad we messed it up because
I did not buy the enamel for the
metallic paint I didn't realize that I
should have but I think it'll be okay I
think that thermal properties aren't
gonna be hindered too much and I think
now that we have the yellow on black
things are gonna look just a bit better
also one other thing you can do while
you have your graphics card torn apart
is replace the stock thermal compound
assuming it hasn't already been replaced
so the stuff they typically put on there
is pretty crappy it gets very crusty and
it doesn't transfer heat very well now
so applying a fresh amount of thermal
compound is usually a good idea I'm
going to go ahead and do this on camera
just to show you how much I put on here
and the idea is to put enough to spread
across the entire die so keep in mind
this is different than a CPU so CPU then
the middle part you see on top is the
IHS it's not the dye itself the Atty is
underneath that and it's typically
smaller than this for most consumer
grade CPUs so you want to cover this
entire little mirrored surface here
because all of this will generate heat
all right and here is the finished
product I'd say this is about a 1 foot
mod it's pretty good considering I'm not
you know a professional painter by any
means but given the tools that I had the
resources that I had and the little
knowledge I have about you know painting
I'd say this is pretty good there are a
couple places I need to touch up right
here a little bit of yellow paint is
nicked from removing the screws a second
time around the paint the the polish
here on the on the black is not perfect
it's a little spotty it looks a little
more metallic and shiny than I wanted
but all in all I think it looks pretty
good it looks better definitely than the
silver before and I think that the
silver underneath is a nice touch as
well to complement this little spindle
here in the blower style fan so now
let's go ahead and install it and call
it a day
and all right so a couple things I want
to say to end this video the first is
very very important I have this link at
the top of the video description just in
case this will void your warranty more
than likely I mean it's it's basically a
done deal once you remove the screws
with little pink tips in them and the
manufacturers can tell that you
disassembled the card after it's
manufactured date that will likely void
your warranty that just shows that you
tampered with the card and it will just
pin any of the issues that you could
potentially have with the court after
the fact on the fact that you
disassembled it so just keep that in
mind this is more of an enthusiast thing
obviously if you just have one graphics
card and it's your absolute sweetheart
don't disassemble it second make sure to
label and group all of your screws
accordingly there are like 40 or 50 with
this particular card usually it's a bit
less than that for third-party
manufacturers but you want to keep these
separate and organized because you don't
want to you know try to screw a
particular screw into the improper
thread right you could just completely
strip the threading and then you can't
properly mount the card back to itself
right you can't mount the cooler to the
PCB or the backplate of the PCB whatever
so keep those organized and again
remember that this will likely forward
your warranty this is an enthusiast
thing I only recommend it for people who
are willing to take that risk
that said though I'm really happy with
the way that's turned out and I think
Lisa is too and ultimately her opinion
is really the only one that I care about
in the end but I do want to know what
you guys think just for future reference
because you guys ultimately got me to
change this way she didn't care about
the silver as much but you guys did and
enough of you said it to where I brought
it up to her and I was like what if I
painted the shroud black and she said
you know what that would probably look a
little better so you guys kind of gave
her that idea and that's what led to
this video so again critique I don't
mind you know at the end of the day just
don't be like just bluntly rude but give
me constructive criticism I'm totally
open to that stuff because I might
implement your ideas into future
revisions or future builds on at this
