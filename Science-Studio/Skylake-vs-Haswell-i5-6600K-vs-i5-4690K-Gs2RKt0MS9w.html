our latest bill featuring the i-5 6600 K
from Intel skylake line up paired with a
GTX 960 from EVGA but I have decided to
kill two birds with one stone you see
rather than forcing you all to watch two
separate videos one detailing just the
benchmarks of our 6600 K skylake build
which is sitting right behind me and the
second covering a head-to-head clash up
between the i5 4690k from has well and
the i5 6600 K from the sky like line up
I'm just gonna combine the book into one
video you guys probably want to see this
more than anything anyway right
I'm alright so very quickly under the
test benches of we using two benchmark
both of these CPUs in the Haswell corner
for our 4690k we paired it with an azrog
z97 extreme for LGA 1150 motherboard and
two 4 gigabyte sticks of Ripjaws 5 ddr3
clocked at 21 33 megahertz I'm trying so
hard to remember these exact
specifications here in the skylight
corner we have the i-5 6600 K of course
and we pair that with an MSI Izzy 178
gaming pro motherboard and 2 4 gigabyte
six of a mixer blitz ddr4 now we're
originally clocked at 2800 megahertz but
that we've toned down to 2133 so that
both of our ram frequencies are exactly
the same it would also be good with me
to know to the fact that both of these
CPUs are overclocked to the exact same
4.6 gigahertz with an NZXT kraken x31
the Haswell chip however did require a
slightly higher voltage than the
skylight counterpart to achieve that
stable 4.6 gigahertz so without further
ado let's jump into our cpu synthetic
test first and then we'll hop on over to
the good stuff the gaming benchmarks
you
you
so there you have it folks our 6600 K
did manage to edge out a win and most of
our benchmarks the main exception being
dying light which for some reason still
prefers has well based CPUs over there
skylight counterparts I really I really
don't know why but even with that point
in mind the 6600 K still is an
improvement from has well but does that
marginal improvement justify completely
rebuilding a PC from the ground up
keep in mind you can't use the exact
same motherboards for both of these
chips this chipset is different than
this chipset and the motherboards
required for both of these CPUs are
completely different so you have to
scrap basically your entire platform
your motherboard your RAM and your chip
in order to upgrade to skylake does it
worth it even if these chips are exactly
the same price where you live let me
know in the comments below
