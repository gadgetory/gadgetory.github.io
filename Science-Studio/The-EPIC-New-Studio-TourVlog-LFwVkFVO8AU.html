Lafayette Louisiana I go to school and I
have my dad driving as many of any
summer up there and we got a bunch stuff
the back to that was wrong and that's
not good
Cagayan the back so that's that's like a
tenth of what we brought to the
apartments near Louisiana and I'm a
little concerned about the computer back
there and that's a $50 dollar computer
and by the hell anything that I have to
replace it of my own pocket so I'm
really hoping that nothing is wrong with
Megan on I say that because this car I
just bought my Twitter you know it is
Hyundai Veloster Turbo has a really
tightly tuned suspension so every single
tiny bump that year that you go over in
this car and you feel to the greatest
extent like Tom I've driven an Audi r8
I've driven a GTR I've driven Corvettes
I haven't felt a suspension as tight as
this one before and so I'm concerned
that that computer is just being tossed
up and down a bunch of little micro
stutters up and down like that not good
for the water cooling radiator in there
which is just screwed it on one end and
kind of being held up by the PCIe slot
at the same time so I will see we're
gonna unpack everything is going to take
all day I'll set up the system tonight
and hopefully it have this video up soon
so let's go
well I guess we're gonna be morbid gals
gonna do that no be smart okay so we are
in the new room this is where everything
is going to be for the most part maybe
make a few changes after the fact but
you can see I bought this l-shaped desk
here this is from a mirror where this is
their included manual and my dad and I
just set this up dad's on his way home
but I've got a lot of wiring to do
especially right there that's where the
computers going to go the one you guys
all know about a deep cool genome
chilling right there
so there's a bunch of stuff just kind of
scattered everywhere it's all over the
place but this is the this is the new
home for the next year roughly so gonna
be a lot of wiring like I said a lot of
I guess kind of tinkering with things
seeing where I like what I might get a
gaming chair from somebody I don't know
I have a chair that's not a swivel chair
that I'll use for now but the point is
I'll be able to just game on this one
here so 1440p at 144 Hertz with a pixel
monitor and then edit and render on the
ultra wide because I think ultra wide
czar better for for that kind of thing
so let's get to wiring I guess you guys
are going to see a time-lapse video of
how this is coming together and
hopefully it pays off in the end maybe
run some LEDs on the bottom back side of
those so we have like a nice little hue
on the bottom yeah lot plan for this
we're gonna get a lot of it done today
but we're still gonna have a lot to go
so here we go
so I think I'm finally finished at least
with this corner of the room over here
if you saw my last video about the aw
key keyboard then you've already kind of
seen this whole setup but I wanted to
show you in a first-person kind of
perspective what's going on with the new
setup in the new room the new apartment
so what happened was I moved back to
Louisiana because go to school at the
University of Louisiana at Lafayette so
I had to drive from Florida to here a
couple days ago and I've been moving in
for the last three or four days I've
been kind of putting things off working
on videos and whatnot so it's still very
messy but I'm still going to show you
guys the full the full place because I
promise you that and I'm sure you guys
are a bit curious so let's go ahead and
start off with this room that's of
course what you've seen I kind of pulled
that I pulled that in from from in the
living room but that's just a kind of an
end table nightstand his what I'm gonna
turn it into there's my bed that I did
not make up this morning ah this was
actually a part of a bookshelf that I
well not really bookshelf it was
actually part of a dresser I guess and
that was on top of it but I moved the
dresser into here because I needed space
for the desk so that's where kind of
yeah it's empty right now but it will be
full a couple of days see here we go and
ya go really care about that now
the rest of this room isn't that
interesting there's just storage under
there couple boxes won't be there in a
few days got a little bookshelf here on
the side that's nice I'm gonna put
something down there I don't know what
yet my xbox one controller another thing
I want to show you now the cable
management with this with this desk that
I showed you a bit earlier is actually
decent
you can run pretty much every cable that
you want down the inside of this thing
as long as it's pressed up against the
wall you will have to worry about seeing
those cables it is quite crammed back
there so if I pull the desk forward I'm
sure all those cables will just start
spilling out but cable management in
this desk anyways is pretty phenomenal
and especially considering how much we
have funneling down the back of the desk
here so yeah you can see it's kind of
dark but all that going into that one I
do a few things coming in too well yeah
two things coming to that one and then I
have my subwoofer here part of that Dell
surround sound system again I have no
idea what the mod
old name or number is of this thing I
know if you've you've been asked me
about that center console but this is
all one big unit just some Adele 5.1
system and I have the other two speakers
right there and there if when I'm just
laying in bed watching TV and stuff so
that's pretty much that
I did take it's kind of a ghetto a
little set up here but I took some
styrofoam and I kind of wedged it up in
here and this is what's propping up the
cables because otherwise they'd be
running on the floor and so this was my
way of getting rid of that temporary
it's not going to last very long I'm
sure but I guess when that day comes on
I'll address it so let's move on from
this room again I get you one more good
look at that
yep that's kind of the room at this
point let's swivel on into the living
room still a big mess but spacious
there's a lot to do with it you can see
we have like a nice little I guess high
chair set up here for eating and whatnot
that's a balcony by the way but you
can't see anything out of it because
there's nothing but a tree right in the
way yeah that's a stellar view and
swinging on around oh that's this is my
my my surrounds and home theater
fountain system so a pulp ten inch
subwoofer I have a cliff contect 5.0
surround sound system that's the center
I have a left there since not an ideal
setup I don't have enough cable
currently to run around the room and
then my front right
that's my yeah that's my back right it's
still in the front and then the back
left is over here on top of the top of
the desk and my brother's room he's
pretty cool he's a really cool kid oh
yeah yeah okay my lion yeah what games
he planned to see the sea ball up on
dota 24/7 yes he does folks here's his
improv curtain because this apartment is
comfo curtains so he like wrapped it
around the blinds I guess that works
very patriotic of him let's swing on
back to the living room for just one
second so this TV here is a 240 Hertz I
know that's TV terminology but it's a an
effective 240 Hertz refresh rate 1080p
TV from Vizio this is not the same one
that I reviewed a few days ago with
McLovin the 55-inch that one wouldn't
fit on this countertop and because we
can't really do anything about furniture
in here I had to go with the 50 inch
this receiver down here is a pioneer
receiver 140 watts to 5 different
channels so I think what does that do
the math somebody it's like 700 watts is
it is that right or it comes to me yep
700 watts so that's a 700 watt roughly
receiver and you get 140 watts per
channel and these are rated for 275 lots
of piece so plenty of headroom
this is really messy I really need to do
something about all this stuff one other
thing I wanted to address I want to hear
what you guys have a suggestion wise for
for this because this is really annoying
what I did last time I lived in a place
like this in some old videos you check
out like here that's a video of me in
the old place what I did was I took this
whole thing this is the sand microphone
kit and I ran it on top of this and this
was on top of that dresser in the closet
so this was already super high and I
could just kind of let it hang over my
head and it could still you know most of
the time be out of the shot well in this
case because the disc is low I mean I
can still fit my knees and stuff under
it but it's still pretty low and because
of how far away my computer is from the
edge of the desk I I don't have enough
cable to route this economically so it's
just kind of hanging there and on top of
that this this isn't this just doesn't
gonna work I don't like this setup here
that's that's no that's no good for me
I want it high I like it that's posted
behind hanging overhead or down low but
I don't I don't like using a stand what
am I gonna use it on when I'm facing
that way so that's a problem another
thing I want to I guess asked for
suggestions about is the the acoustic
problem so if you watch the Yaqui
keyboard video you know my audio was was
pretty pretty dank I was echoing all
over the place and that is thanks mostly
to these lead painted walls
so these lid walls have basically zero
absorption properties and so does the
ceiling which is also coated with the
same stuff and
laminate floors so yeah this whole thing
is just a big ol echo cube and that
really is not conducive to satisfactory
audio so folks I want to hear from you
some suggestions I know you can buy the
sound foam the sound dampening foam you
can put everywhere I can't push stuff
into these walls I can't nail anything
in this is saying I'm just renting this
is like a lease so I can't I can't
damage these walls if I did I'd have to
cover it up somehow I want to take that
chance
so I need some other suggestions maybe
like I don't care if it's super sketchy
what not just like hanging blankets on
the ceiling and walls whatever just give
me some feedback let me know what you
think I should do to fix that issue
it doesn't sound too bad right now with
the camera mic because I'm so close to
it but when I'm further away from this
blue Yeti right here it creates a
problem so I think that's it I think
that's that's pretty much everything
that you guys would be interested in
seeing I can give you a tour of the
campus later on if you want this is this
is you well I mean it's not a big campus
is not like LSU but it is a nice campus
and kind of the middle of nowhere it
rains every other day rain today rain
yesterday and rain pretty much the whole
week before that Louisiana floods were
pretty pretty severe so uh if there's
anything else that I didn't show you
that you're interested in seeing let me
know and I can put that in another video
I do have like okay that's kind of like
my storage section down there
uninteresting but so you know the
massive pile of boxes ahead of my my
bedroom back home that's kind of where
this this is now this all these boxes
are a part of that I did get rid of a
lot of the parts but not all of them so
that's kind of what you're seeing a
leftovers of right there I'll use some
of them I'll plug if some of them away I
don't know but uh that's that's it folks
let me know what you think about the
video let me know what you think about
the new setup and be sure to stay tuned
for some some pretty good stuff we got
coming your way we have a really good PC
build actually almost entirely sponsored
by companies for the first time ever I'm
very fortunate enough to be able to do
that now thanks to all of you all your
support so we need to prove to them that
we are growing community folks be sure
to do everything you haven't already
video if you haven't subscribed already
do that I don't know if you dislike the
video I guess I can't stop from
disliking it but come on that's setup
right there folks that hmm yep so far so
good
this is science studio thanks for didn't
really learn much well you did actually
I did yeah you learned you learned about
rose living and all the new stuff I got
going on so yeah thanks for learning
