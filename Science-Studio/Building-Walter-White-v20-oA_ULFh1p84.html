you're goddamn right I'm gonna take that
as a yes
upgrade we shall first off to GTX ten
seventies from EVGA these I paid for out
of my own pocket and I did this because
I wanted two cards that match now I know
I already have one in there that one's
the one that's being given away by the
way the asus rog Strix gtx 1070 but i I
think that I can do a little better with
the paint job to be completely honest
and EVGA has built in white LEDs and no
matter what I try in the configurator
for Asus I cannot get those LEDs to turn
white so I think this is going to be a
better bit a big deal it's going to look
better in the long run anyway Walter
white version 2.0 will appreciate that
so of course two of those and then check
this out as Roxanne over there x99
Taichi now I asked specifically for the
Taichi because as you'll see here
shortly it has a ton of white actions
now that the entire PCB isn't white or
silvery white like the Asus tough as any
170 motherboard is but it's close enough
and I think that it's going to look
beautiful in the S 340 and I plan on
doing something very soon with the s3 40
cases well stay tuned for that and then
to top everything off processor what do
we have here this is a xeon e5 26:30 i
almost said that wrong 26:30 v4 so this
runs at a stock 2.2 gigahertz a single
core will turbo up to 3.2 i believe
maybe 3.1 now this is essentially by all
regards except for the fact that doesn't
have an eye GPU and it's not
overclockable using the multiplier
method it doesn't have an unlike
multiplier apart from that it's
basically a 69 50 X and that's kind of
why I chose it I was actually originally
going to purchase the 69 50 X and a lot
of you talked me out of that and on
Twitter so thank you very much for that
but we're going to start assembling
everything just going to kind of do it
vlog e style like I did in the past I
think that that's the easiest way for me
to edit and it's kind of a more on a
personal experience for all of you as
well so let's get to assembling tearing
down things in there that we're not
going to need and then putting the good
stuff the new stuff into walter white
version 2.0
don't mind my bed folks this is my
office as much as it is my bedroom I
sleep right there and I work right there
but uh like a giddy little child this
morning this is the first time that I've
ever moved up to x99 how the heck you
get this out of here and I'm pumped
because I'm gonna get to run so many new
tests with a unique processor that not
many people have and won't just see how
well the Xeon ends up faring out in the
long run installation guide all right
don't need that now this is cool
built-in Wi-Fi so we have our Wi-Fi and
10a right here in 10a how do you say
that antenna
antennas maybe it is just a simple
plural and then right there there's our
SLI bridge I think I was showing you the
what is this listen Asylum bridge yeah
this is nice leverage I get to finesse
Li bridges so if you want 3-way SLI you
got this one and then two-way SLI you
have this one here so very cool they
include both there onto the motherboard
itself this is where you'll get to see
that whole color coordination thing
we've got going on again like I said not
a completely white PCB but it's got some
pretty darn cool accents including the
whole like clock gear mechanical thing
going on and now a lot of that will be
covered by the two graphics cards but
not a problem because they are huge 2011
v3 socket r8 DIMM slots and a lot of
good stuff will go over here on the left
side as well as the right doctor debug
down here all your peripheral support 24
pin power connector our 8 pin is up here
on top above the x99 little symbol 2 m
dot two slots on the front of the board
that's something I'm not going to be
using right now maybe in the future but
SSDs or what I'll stick with for now I
think I'm probably gonna paint this I
think so yeah I think I've made up my
mind I'm gonna paint that white and I
will do so using white engine enamel oh
my wow this is a heavy processor and
much larger than typical z170 z97 CPUs
even larger than some bulldozer
piledriver CPUs from AMD this is where
things always get tricky because I want
to get some sweet tech porn shots and oh
yeah
yeah that's a good one even though you
can't read anything there we go now
we're talking look at that first thing
we're going to do is paint this heatsink
like we talked about all it requires is
the removable two screws on the back of
the motherboard so one was here and one
was here and now you flip the board back
over this should just there goes I also
want to open the 10 70s it's we need to
decide what we're going to paint on each
of these I'm pretty sure we're going to
paint the backplate that's just
typically black might paint some of the
accents as well so let's see what we can
pull apart here so yep definitely
painting the back plate let's flip
around pop or open oh stuck on that side
look at that beauty and guess what folks
there's one more there she is not fairly
certain this one was used prior I
purchased this brand new so this
shouldn't be open but it is it's
actually dusting too and it's scratched
up a bit what is this my back plate
looks okay but the front check this out
right here it's kind of hard to tell
there we go see those scratches those
shouldn't be there this is a brand new
card
supposedly but I know it's I know it's
not just by looking at it this one on
the other hand is brand new and if it's
not brand new they did a good job
covering it up because well that right
there
okay so as of right now the front shroud
of both the gtx 1070 s are pretty much
good to go the backsides a little rough
you're not going to be seeing that and I
was sure to tape off the front LED panel
whatever they call this so I'd say it's
a job well done for the graphics cards
at least the back plates are looking ok
a few spots here and there that's just
what I get for not using a professional
paint studio but I'm willing to live
with that and the cool thing is because
I'm using too I can choose to put the
one that looks better on top so I'm not
sure and that one's got a few spots on
it that one has a few bubbles on it
we'll play with it and then lastly the
heat sink on the Tai Chi from asrock
that's a little rough I had to
completely start over I was actually
scraping off paint from that I don't
know if it's dry yet either so I'm not
going to touch it that's one thing you
definitely don't want to do when you're
painting PC parts when you're painting
anything really
don't touch the paint until you are 100%
certain that it is dry otherwise you'll
leave a fingerprint or they'll smear the
paint and it will be just a pain to try
to correct later on so I'm gonna let
that dry a bit more I'm pretty confident
these are finished drying are close
enough anyway and so we're going to
assemble those back together and take a
few more tech horn shots of the new
white super clock EVGA gtx 1070 s in
case you're wondering this is how I
masked off that this front little panel
here this is what lights up sits EVGA
gtx 1070 I'm pretty sure that's what it
says on it but I just took some cheap
old tape and covered that up and because
I use engine enamel I'm not going to
have to worry about the paint kind of
stretching out and tearing like you
would have with Plasti Dip
so you should just be able to pull this
off
I want to do this live so I want you to
see the result I guess in person already
did it with the other card but this card
here was a bit trickier sorry about this
mess it's yeah we're in hardware mode
right now folks all this good stuff off
of there just want to be careful not to
actually pull the thing apart you see
that's all still intact no paint
anywhere on that and then very gently
pull up the tape going around a little
rough there but mostly good and there
you go that is well the almost finished
product I have to put this on the actual
card which is sitting back there
that's how I yeah that's how I did that
you
well Walter white is having a few issues
but maybe just one big issue it's not
posting at all no everything's turning
on a go ahead and do that for you right
now so we'll see that's a fan scraping
against something on that graphics card
I'll have to fix that but ignore that
that's that's not good for the card but
we'll fix that shortly so right
everything looks looks like it should be
running but if you check down here
there's a doctor debug all right right
back there and doctor debug is not
showing any code whatsoever which leads
me to believe that there's some kind of
power delivery issue or that the CPU is
not seated correctly maybe a bent pin or
two well that didn't take long
there is your issue folks at least
that's what I assume what's causing the
posting issues one of these from the
cable mod kit just straight-up popped
out so I was running essentially a
seventh in EPS cable that's not
advisable and so we're going to fix that
and hopefully receive a proper post this
time well folks this is it Walter white
version 2.0 featuring the xeon e5 26:30
v4 10 core 20 thread processor 2 EVGA
GTX 10 70s and well I've recycled a lot
of other things but I also have the
asrock x99 Taichi
I don't know Taichi but the motherboard
sure does it's a beautiful light and
well semi black PCB combo cool little
you're seeing it right there a
mechanical gear looking design and I
just think it fits the build very well
I'm glad I went with this board and not
with something that didn't really match
at all so it's nice to have those white
accents on there now in terms of
benchmarks I will have those ready for
you tomorrow so I'm going to be doing
CPU synthetic tests I'll be running some
gaming benchmarks to see how this thing
performs because we all know the Zeon's
aren't really ideal for gaming
especially when it comes to a hike or
account and relatively low frequency so
I will see what we can do there and I'm
just really tired this bill took me two
days to put together two full days
longer than
ever take me to build a PC before mainly
because I had an issue with the CPU
seating speaking of that I almost forgot
to address that so on Twitter and
Instagram if you're following there you
know that I was having issues with
getting a post so there's a dr. D bug on
the very bottom of the motherboard and
that's usually supposed to spit out some
codes at least in the beginning and when
you first turn on your PC and I wasn't
getting anything not even a doctor debug
notification telling me what was wrong
with the PC so the only two or three
things I could think of that may have
caused that was the power supply maybe I
just wasn't getting adequate enough
power to the motherboard I don't know
why that would be the case though
because the power supply was working
perfectly in walter white version 1.0 or
there was some kind of cable
disconnection which there ended up being
I don't know if that was what was
causing the issue though I honestly I
fixed that and it was still having
problems so it probably wasn't causing
the issue and definitely could have
caused issues in the long run depending
on which of those eight pins was
disconnected but then on top of that I
guess there was some kind of CPU seating
issue I put it incorrectly I look this
is my first rodeo I kind of know what
I'm doing right for some reason once I
removed the CPU and reinserted it the
exact same way I'm telling you the exact
same way I inserted it the first time
secured it all back together I mean I
was literally just right here I just
pulled off the the water block and just
reinserted it that was really it and if
once I did that I started getting post
and I got readings from dr. debug
telling me everything was a-ok so in
terms of well just the science behind
why that happened
I have no explanation I don't know maybe
I mean maybe just there just wasn't one
pin contacting the CPU and maybe that
was just the improper seating on my part
I have no idea but whatever I did
reinserting the CPU so that's all I did
fix the issue so I'm just glad it's
working and I can't wait to start
running some benchmarks I haven't
actually done that yet I did run
Cinebench I got a score of like 1280
we're gonna see if we can base clock
overclock a bit and bring that score up
I'm not sure if I want to be able to do
that at all with this BIOS just given
the fact that it's a Xeon
and it doesn't come with an unlocked
multiplier so we'll be stuck to just the
base clock frequency and on top of that
it's not drawing a ton of power it's
only got an 85 watt TDP versus the 650 X
is 140 watt TDP I think is what it is so
that one's clearly ready for
overclocking this one's not which tells
me that it's going to be pretty stubborn
but we'll see how far we can get all
including that as well and maybe not the
benchmarking video I might try that
later on just because I don't want any
system instability in the meantime it's
getting pretty dark outside and that's
my that's my LED panel most of the time
so I'm gonna call this one quits thanks
for watching me build this for two I
know doesn't seem like two days to you
but it was two days for me it's almost
the end of the second day I'm just glad
it's working I think it looks beautiful
let me know what you think in the
comments below give this video a thumbs
up if you thought it was cool give a
thumbs down if you do feel the beat
opposites okay you won't hurt my
feelings maybe just just a little bit
and then subscribe if you haven't
already stay tuned for more stuff like
this including the benchmarks 2.0 Walter
White if you want to know how the Xeon
fares 10 cores a lot of cores but it's
relatively low frequency across the
board but we do have two gtx 1070 s to
pick up the slack
I don't know I'm expecting it to perform
around walter white version 1.0 that's
just because the 6700 K in there is
pretty much the best gaming CPU
available thanks to its very strong
single core performance I think the Xeon
here is going to definitely hurt us but
the second gtx 1070 should remedy the
issue if not pick up the frame large
frame rates frame rates a bit more this
is science studio thanks for learning
with us
