studio we're excited because we have a
new computer bill that we will be able
to transform from just paper and lists
to its physical manifestation we will
actually acquire these parts and we will
put this computer together we will also
have a video showing step-by-step
instructions this time of how to
assemble it so stay tuned for that
thanks for being patient with us what we
wanted to do here was run by the parts
with you so maybe if you kind of sort of
want to build along with us I guess that
would be great and so we guarantee that
this computer will for the price
definitely hold up in the gaming ring as
well as the central processing ring if
you want to do video editing and stuff
like that so without further ado we're
gonna jump right into our list and
hopefully you enjoy the parts that we've
picked this is a budget build of $600
that seems to be the price point the
sweet spot for a lot of people that
don't want to spend $1,000 to have the
coolest and baddest gaming tower rig
whatever this is just a respectable $600
computer and we're excited about it like
we said so we're gonna dive into it
right now so the first and most
important piece to our computer puzzle
will be the AMD FX 6300 processor this
is generic no we included this in our
last hypothetical computer build but
this is a solid processor we can't
emphasize this enough for the price you
are getting really big banging and so we
want to make sure that we stay within
the bounds of our skews my dollar budget
and for dot 99.99 I'm gonna come on
you're getting a hexa core processor
don't skip out on this this deal is
great I'm sure the price will only
continue to go down but as of right now
this price is extremely competitive and
that's why we really can't even consider
buying an Intel when this pricing is
this I mean you can buy it in so I three
for $120 but you're only getting a
dual-core yes hyper threading is there
but I mean come
I know quartic or intel beat sanctity
every time for the price and for six
cores it's it's almost a no-brainer in
this price pool to go with the FX 6300
and so that's what we've effectively
chosen and so we're gonna move on from
that now to our motherboard and this is
the typical gigabyte am3+ motherboard
that we've shown in the past this is the
micro ATX a 78 LMT motherboard it has
plenty of USB 3.0 points this has HDMI
DVI VGA all included not that we're
gonna need that because we have a pretty
cool graphics card coming up next but
for 50 $6.99 this is this is this is it
I mean this is really what you want at
this price point we're gonna do a bit of
overclocking so you can see there's some
heat sinks there and that's cool we'll
take advantage of those as well and it
has four dimm slots which is great so if
you ever want to upgrade your RAM in the
future we're only going with two sticks
right now but for you know in the future
as possible so this is I guess future
proof in that sense so that's cool and
that's what we're going to take
advantage of at that price point next is
that holy geforce gtx 960 this isn't a
970 this is one a 980 TI titan next
whatever but for 600 bucks come on I
mean that's a $219 car this is just a
bit over a third of our budget but you
really can't go wrong with this and look
four gigabytes four gigabytes of vram in
there and three fan coolers I mean come
on this is a really cool card for the
price it's gigabyte it's reliable it
says win for us on the front because
that's the brand that
they advertise with gigabyte so it looks
pretty cool it's gonna look cool in our
rig and like we said the prices is very
competitive this is you know you can
pick the two you go by version if you
want we just picked four because for
kind of future proof and you know we're
only a 128-bit you know processing power
of it that's okay you want to go 256 bit
in the same price point go AMD that's
fine we went AMD for the CPU so we're
gonna go Nvidia for the GPU and don't
believe those myths out there about how
AMD processors can't communicate
properly with the GPUs that are video
based that's completely made up that
there are there's no physical proof that
AMD and NVIDIA can't cooperate
I mean first off they're entirely
separate units but there's there's no
solid proof that there's any
interference at all between the two
brands when they are working together in
the computer so don't be afraid to buy
mixed parts okay they're compatible if
they weren't it would be expressed in
red letters and he would be seeing
several reviews about how old don't buy
an AMD car with an Nvidia graphic card
or vice versa it just come on so on from
that rant we're gonna move on to our RAM
which is the kind of final piece to our
motherboard puzzle and this Ram in
particular I mean
38:19 I have never seen 2 4 gigabytes
fix of 1600 megahertz Ram for under $40
and these g.skill ripjaws right now
which look pretty awesome by the way
they have pretty cool red heat sinks on
them or only 38 99 hop on this ASAP even
if you're looking to upgrade it's ok you
can have Mitch mix and match Ram cards
you can have two red ones in two Crucial
Ballistix random or it's it's not going
to hurt as long as they're both 1600
megahertz put them in their series and
they're dimm slots and you'll be good to
go but for our Rick in particular a
gigabytes will do us just fine and at 38
99 is a steal so on from that we have
the power supply EVGA 500 watt power
supply generic power supply but it's 80
plus so it'll save you a few bucks a
month on your power bill that's
comes with a three-year warranty that's
great and we have plenty of cables to
supply us the adequate power that we
need to this rig work so you know don't
worry 500 watts is okay it's I know it's
not seven hundred or a thousand whatever
this overkill wattages are for this
build five hundred watts is not a
problem at all so and for forty dollars
that's not a problem either so that
stays within the bounds of our budget
and next we're gonna go with the case
like we've said before this is entirely
up to you it's not a big deal what case
you decide to pick as long as the form
factor complements the parts in your
list in this case you see that in the
area that our graphics card would exist
in right there in the middle horizontal
line of that case we have plenty of
space for our three fan GPU and we're
looking forward to fitting all the parts
in here this is a nice case it's not the
cheapest case but it does come with a
cool window we always like the windowed
cases and it's a reliable brand
Thermaltake is a reliable brand it's 79
27 $12.99 shipping with this particular
vendor but if you want to save a few
bucks there buy a cheaper one it's hard
to find cheap cases that have you know
windowed side pains and stuff but we
like aesthetics and we have some room in
our budget for aesthetics so we're gonna
take advantage of that so that's pretty
much the build with the exception of
storage and I wanted to run this by you
before we hopped over to the last two
parts of this build which aren't
necessary but we're gonna take advantage
of just because we have a spare hard
disk drive lying around the typical
go-to for storage space in a budget
build of this kind would be probably the
WD blue one terabyte hard drive that's
not a big deal
it's fifty two dollars I believe on
Amazon new eggs a similar price and
that's cool you know that's that's 50
bucks so that that's a good chunk your
budget but if you can find a spare hard
drive lying around anywhere from the
computer towers not being used anymore
that has two hard drives oh if you find
two hard drives in a tower and
just taking throw that in your bill
that'll save you $50 you're not gonna
have a terabyte storage but you're gonna
have storage you can put your operating
system on a few good games I know GTA 5
is like sixty two gigabytes book you
know it's upgradable you can always add
more hard drives later when you get the
money so in this case we just want you
to find a hard drive or just spend 20
bucks or 30 bucks on a 300 gig hard
drive and with that in mind we do want
to show you the two extra things that we
will be buying with this bill just
because we have the spare we have the
spare money in our budget for this we
can a lot to these things the first
being the Corsair series 120 millimeter
fan quite edition high airflow Corsair
fans these are great you can get them a
blue purple red white I believe and for
20 bucks for two it's a good deal these
have excellent reviews Corsairs of their
reliable brand and we plan on putting
these in the front of our case the front
of the Thermaltake cases actually
transparent so it would look quite cool
to have blue glowing lights in the front
of our case and that's the plan
we have the budget to do it that's
that's great and we're definitely gonna
see using the day with that one and the
other thing that is probably a little
more important at least because this
isn't really aesthetic oriented but this
is oriented if toward the CPU if you
plan on over vlogging that 6,300 which
comes stock unlocked to be overclocked
you're probably want to buy a third
party CPU cooler and in this case we
decided to go with the cooler master
hyper t4 this is only $24.99 most of
them are 3040 dollars but this is one in
particular is a pretty good price you
can go with the smaller form factors at
tx3 and the t - those are eighteen
sixteen dollars but $24.99 gives you a
solid CPU cooler that will let us
overclock our hexa core processor to
around four four point two gigahertz so
we're satisfied with that I would say
that if you wanted to chop anything out
of the budget the first thing to go
would have to be those blue LED fans
just because they're they're really not
necessary and the thermal take case
already comes with fans installed so
you're really not missing out on any
performance if you decide to skip out on
those blue LED lights so keep that in
mind
remember to stay within the bounds of
your budget it may not be six hundred
dollars and maybe a thousand dollars but
just don't overspend because that's
always going to be in the back of your
mind oh I spent more than I'll expose to
you unless you buy something
ridiculously crazy that you just focus
on because it's such a good item that
you bought like maybe a Titan X or
something but I mean you're paying a
thousand dollars plus for those cards so
unless you're filthy rich or just have a
lot of money flying around this is a
pretty solid build and very competitive
build for the price of six hundred
dollars so this is exactly what we're
going to buy and this is exactly what
we'll be putting together in our next
computer building video we will be sure
to attach a link to this video so that
when we do upload it you can hop on
right over to that and you know watch us
build it or maybe build along with us if
you decided to purchase parts similar to
these but we want to show you what we're
gonna get before we decided to simulate
everything into the case like I said in
the last computer building video and the
next one will be much more professional
we have new equipment we have new
recording equipment you filming
equipment and we're excited to put
together finally a professional computer
building video and so thanks for being
patient with us we will be sure to have
the link attached it's not here now that
means we haven't uploaded video yet but
if it is here seize the day
this is science studio thanks for
learning with you
