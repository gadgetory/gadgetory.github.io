sending us to Computex 2017 in a few of
my recent PC builds i've used ram from a
company called keen group and i don't
make any secret of the fact that i am
actually a really big fan of their
products he might not have heard of them
with what you've heard of some of the
competitors that have been around for
quite a long time but I'm here to tell
you especially being in this booth here
at Computex 2017 special thanks to them
by the way but their new stuff coming
out it looks really good and it's me
very very fast so I wasn't joking when I
said they had very cool-looking Ram on
deck ready to release very soon now
let's go through some of the details
here not only are you getting sold in a
black color just the frame itself but
also white white dims we pretty cool you
all know how I feel about color white on
top of that RGB LED integration and
synchronization with a 6 or so if you
want to turn your motherboard RGB colors
to a certain theme you can also control
the RAM itself with that software so
there's 100% integration here by the
time these are released it will have
that full support on board and even more
from the team group booth here key force
Delta RGB these are very similar to the
Nighthawks only have the art to be
spending the entire top of the dim frame
these are also only going to be
available in black at first so if you
want some white one get teamed up a
little push maybe they'll release those
as well up top here we've got a g-force
kardea around 2,700 megabytes per second
both read and write and also an
integrated heat sink just a little cameo
over here to the far right Ingrid's dark
ROG I've uses quite a bit including in a
custom loop Ryan's and TC build check it
out in the card somewhere around here if
you haven't already kind of crouching
down here we have the T source extremes
this is seems real kind of just showing
off a little bit nothing wrong with that
these are running on the X $2.99
platform from Intel 4000 mega Hertz EDR
for not a problem at all you can buy the
extremes and either gold or silver and
if you get lucky the special edition in
black with a signature of a special
person will interview here shortly in
case you didn't know teen group also
specializes in external SSE the storage
in general so we've got the 3d 700 here
in my hand comes in silver and black
read and write T's around 700 and 500
megabytes per second respectively also a
very small one 480 gigabytes max boards
on that but it's super portable II might
even lose it so keep it close to I've
got a couple of interesting USB store
stratosphere the person which is won a
couple of awards all the way around 360
degrees very versatile 128 gigabyte
drive right here and then they can drive
I've got my attention I'm trying to get
them to send me one of these there's a
limited supply of I'm only a thousand
are going to be sold and virtually
indestructible so not only is it
waterproof but it is also virtually dust
proof this cap here by the way it's
super super sealed on they're not gonna
have a problem with any of that and then
off to the right you can run it over
with well a Hummer we're going to do a
lot of very interesting thing trying to
break this USB drive we're going to try
I have been mesmerized by this train
fitted with a GoPro Hero 5 you see it
being screamed right here so pin group
also has several SD cards meant for
different things so these two here on
the corners are intended for ultra-high
definition filming particularly on some
very fancy cameras and then up top we
also have an SD card that fertilizes an
Android operating system to restore
applications on this drive which is nice
if you only have 8 or 16 gigs of
internal storage and you can dish over a
lot of that a lot of that weight on to
the dedicated removable SD card and just
when you think there couldn't be much
more the brick charger good for what is
not the five devices here quite a bit
you can charge at the same time and in
this this is that this is interesting
this is called the most - now I know
this is a kind of a weird name let's be
honest but it's very cool especially for
iPhone users they are slightly limited
in their storage expandability options
so theme group solves that by giving you
the small little card reader here at the
bottom good for micro SD card so if you
have a bunch of pictures you want to be
able to transfer in and out of your
iPhone which then play a bit more
limited in its Android counterpart let's
be honest this is your solution right
here and in case you were wondering
something a little extra with this brick
charger here pull on Lego compatibility
top and bond got the stormtroopers
chilling on top and storage simple well
simple as that now we're going to end
this segment of the team group copy sex
coverage with a bit of b-roll here the T
course dims these are actually in white
so there you go you've already been
answered white Delta dims that will be
available soon now the our GD
functionality here is a bit of a
prototype phase so by the time these are
released
public they look even better than they
already do and then also the left we do
have an example of nighthawk ddr4 in
full action and a beautiful PC build to
the left so what we're going to do is
interview a very special gentleman
representing Team Group and I'm going to
show us a few cool things that we
haven't already do much into in the
first segment so with that we're going
to call it quits this is science studio
thanks for traveling with her
