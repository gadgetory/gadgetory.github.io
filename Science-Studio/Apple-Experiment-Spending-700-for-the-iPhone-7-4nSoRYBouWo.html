of you are wondering Greg you've just
purchased an iPhone SC why the heck did
you do that
now I have two phones I don't know what
I'm going to do with this one I think
I'm gonna give it to my mom for
Christmas or something hope she doesn't
watch this video I wanted to try out the
newest and best from Apple this is the
Apple experiment after all I know I've
gone over the 30 day thing that's why
I'm just calling these videos Apple
experiment I figured I should try out
the newest and greatest no this isn't
the iPhone 7 plus so I don't have the
the dual camera array or the large
screen with a slightly higher pixel
density or anything like that but I am
getting once a flagship phone basically
from Apple and I'm gonna give you my raw
impressions right now
let's discuss build quality first do I
like the new design that's a trick
question because it's not actually a new
design in fact Apple has been recycling
this style of iPhone for the past two or
three generations now and back back to
the iPhone 6 I put these next to each
other you wouldn't really notice much of
a difference apart from the fact that
the antenna bands wrap around the phone
instead of through the phone the camera
protrudes just a bit more and has a
slightly larger opening the flash looks
a tiny bit different the home button is
not a physical button anymore I don't
know if you knew that they didn't really
advertise this very much on Apple's
website they were pretty discreet about
it actually when I first picked up this
phone I don't know how many explain this
to you because what you're just watching
you're not holding it actually doing it
but when you push the home button an
iPhone 7 or an iPhone 7 plus get ready
for a surprise it's not actually a
button
in fact when you push whatever this is
is little indentation I guess on the on
the glass what happens is there's a
little motor back there and it just
vibrates it just moves and gives the
feeling of a push in fact when you click
the button even the click itself is fake
because if you turn the phone off and
try to push the home button in nothing's
going to happen is gonna feel like it's
a jammed button like you're pushing
anywhere else on the glass but when you
push it with the phone on you hear a
slight little click I don't know if
you're probably not gonna hear it when I
do it but this little click right here
okay that sounds 100% mechanical right
that's actually fake all of it hears I
guess the way that I can prove that to
you so I'm going to cover up the speaker
and I'm gonna click the button again and
you tell me if you hear anything that
was me clicking thumb off thumb on I'm
basically covering up the speaker that's
projecting the sound out from the phone
but you can hear it when I'm covering it
so yeah this is all fake down here it's
that's all artificial it's very weird
I don't mind it it's a different feeling
it makes you it feels like I'm pushing
the entire bottom end of the phone into
the phone if that makes sense like the
entire screen is just kind of going like
that when I push it it is different it's
a lot different from the very mechanical
feeling of a physical home button like
the iPhone 5 s 6 and the 6s so that's
something that kind of caught me off
guard I think it's cool I don't I don't
know if it's going to stick around but
it's something to get used to to say the
least let's
on to camera quality next that was
actually a big reason why I was
interested in trying out the new iPhone
I knew that not much had changed in
terms of just how fluid the operating
system was any of that will get to the
performance here in a sec as for the
camera you're looking at a 12 megapixel
f1 pointed aperture with optical image
stabilization that's something I loved
on my note 4 when I was an Android user
and as you can see these clips right
here just my brother and I walking down
the sidewalk I'm actually walking while
I'm filming but you can't really tell
that I am that's optical image
stabilization folks it looks very very
smooth it's not choppy or you know very
I guess cut up it looks very fluid you
can definitely tell the difference
between those that have it and those
that don't
and I'm glad Apple has made this one a
staple in terms of picture quality 12
megapixels that F 1.8 aperture means
you're going to get some stunning images
especially in low-light situations it
just means that your your cameras going
to take in a lot more light which will
aid in those low-light shots you won't
see as much of that blurry kind of
fuzziness that you get in in low-light
situations that's something that that
wider aperture will definitely help you
out with as for the front-facing camera
we're looking at 7 megapixels I just
have the specs up here I don't know
these by heart f 2.2 aperture which is
still pretty good that's I mean some
modern phones today still use an F 2.2
aperture on their rear facing camera so
we're looking at excellent quality for
the front basic camera you're seeing an
example right there and then 1080p at
30fps 720p at 240 FPS so even slow-mo
with the front-facing camera I actually
didn't know that I'm gonna try that out
now on to speaker quality just because
they remove the headphone jack which
we'll get to as well that doesn't mean
they replaced it with a second speaker
this is still just a microphone and over
here you have your speaker on the bottom
great Apple quality as usual and then on
top here we have a second speaker that's
something new so you're actually getting
a stereo effect as a result of the
second speaker it's not as I guess clear
and just crisp sounding as the bottom
speaker but nonetheless it is there and
if you're just watching something like a
YouTube video or I don't know listening
some comedy show or whatever and you
don't want to have your phone out like
this and have to turn up your volume you
can literally just put it up to your ear
and listen to it like this I found this
is actually pretty cool it looks like
you're talking on the phone even though
you might actually just be I don't know
listening to some music video or
something like that
as
or performance apart from the camera
which we just discussed the appellate
infusion one of the most powerful mobile
grade CPUs available packed into the
Apple iPhone 7 but what does that mean
not much actually in fact because iOS is
such a lightweight operating system to
begin with compared to something like
Android moving from say an iPhone 6s or
as I did my case an iPhone se to the
iPhone 7 isn't going to blow your mind
you're not going to see those huge
performance gains like you did between
something like a galaxy s3 and a galaxy
s6 it's just the differences aren't
there and it's because while the iPhone
6s was already super super fast and
upgrading for the sake of the
performance benefits the iPhone 7 offers
would be kind of crazy in my opinion
sure the Geekbench scores say otherwise
but like I said going back to the
operating system there wasn't really
much lag to begin with in the iPhone 6s
even as far back as maybe the iPhone 5s
I would argue that's where you would
start to see the performance gains taper
off and in that case I would recommend
an iPhone 7 now I'm not running 10.1
apparently it's supposed to be a huge
performance boost for the iPhone 7 there
is a bit of a delay when I close apps
sometimes when I transition in the
multitasking window things get a little
delayed but that was instantaneous I
don't know what I'm talking about
but ten point one's supposed to fix a
few of those minor issues it's already
blazing fast the differences between the
iPhone se and the iPhone 7 or the iPhone
6s and the iPhone 7 are marginal and in
my book do not justify the $600 price
tag of leaf iPhone 7 unless you plan on
trading in your iPhone 6s or se or
whatever for that $300 trade in thing
that Best Buy and a few others are doing
all of links to those I guess deals in
the video description if you're
interested now let's talk about what's
not included in the iPhone 7 and that's
a headphone jack set a problem for you
it's likely a problem for you it's
probably why you're watching this video
you want to know what I have to say
about it it kind of shied me away from
the iPhone 7 in the first place I'll
admit that's why I didn't wait for this
to be released when I started the Apple
experiment I said well there's no way
I'm gonna want a phone that doesn't have
a headphone jack that's super weird but
Apple actually remedied the situation in
and while in my case I don't know if it
will be in your case obviously if you
plan on charging your phone and
listening to headphones at the same time
this can be an issue but they did
include a lightning cable to
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack converter so you can use pretty
much any standard headset that you
already had that you were in fear of not
being able to use as a result of not
having a standard headphone jack but
then on top of that they also include a
just a typical Apple headset that plugs
directly into the Lightning port so you
have two different solutions there
obviously like I said if you want to
charge your phone at the same time it's
going to be a problem you have to buy
some kind of adapter and pretty sure
Apple sells that adapter I'll link it in
this video's description but it hasn't
been a deal breaker for me I don't feel
like I want to go take back the phone
because it doesn't have a headphone jack
so I think they did a good job it in
most cases I can't speak for everyone
obviously everyone has different tastes
different opinions but in my case I
don't feel inclined to return this I
don't feel disappointed that one's not
there because I mean even if I wanted to
listen to music with my old headset that
otherwise wouldn't be compatible with a
phone I can just use the adapter and I
can't think of really any case where I'd
want to listen to something with a
headset and charge my phone at the same
time unless I was like binge watching
Netflix or something so friend of mine
said that was an issue for him but I
would say in most cases you're going to
be okay
without having the headphone jack yeah
shocker I'd ever thought I would say
that but now that I have the phone and
I've got to play around with it for a
while I'm not disappointed that it's not
there who knows maybe it will be a thing
maybe so to wrap this up do I regret
purchasing this now keep in mind for the
entire Apple experiment everything that
I have obtained from Apple has been out
of my own pockets so I've been
purchasing basically everything at Best
Buy the guys over Best Buy I'm sure
loved me by now I've spent over
two-and-a-half grand at Best Buy the
past month or so but after tax this
phone came out to about $700 it's a 32
gigabyte version for Verizon it's
unlocked I didn't buy it with a contract
or anything like that I don't do
contracts so I'm a little regretful
about my purchase just a little bit in
terms of just overall feel how the phone
feels how fluid it is what I can do with
it it's no different than my iPhone se
straight up and if you don't have an
iPhone Seb have something like an iPhone
success it's basically the same thing
the iPhone se is just as powerful if not
a little bit more powerful than the 6s
because the screen on the SD is a bit
smaller so you know less processing
power required to keep the screen
running by the way battery life is OK my
iPhone s these battery life is better I
suppose I do regret purchasing this but
I'm not going to return it I'm going to
keep using it keep testing it keep
experimenting with it make it make a few
more videos I guess and keep talking to
you guys about it it's just a different
side of things I know a lot of you are
not accustomed to I know that a lot of
you don't agree with Apple and their way
of doing things that's actually why I
started the experiment in the first
place so I mean at least appreciate that
fact right like I'm willing to spend
money for the sake of all of you so I
guess at least reinforce your negative
views of Apple if you have negative
views and then maybe get those who
aren't as negative towards Apple a bit
more excited about the future of Apple
because I think that the iPhone age
whatever they call it probably iPhone 8
is supposed to be a really big deal so
that's it I purchased an iPhone 7 for
$700 and I regret my decision a lot of
you were probably saying surprise
surprise Greg you should have seen that
coming
but hey for the sake of science and
experimentation right this is the Apple
experiment after all if you appreciate
this video be sure to give it a thumbs
up give it a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite or if you hate
