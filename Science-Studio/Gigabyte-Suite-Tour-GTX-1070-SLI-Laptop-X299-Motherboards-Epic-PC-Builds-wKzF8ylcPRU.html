sending us to Computex 2017 what is up
everyone we are here in the gigabytes
suite here in Taipei Taiwan for Computex
2017 they have an entire floor we're
going to walk around and check
everything out we started off with this
because we think this is really cool
very unique all these custom builds here
using gigabyte Hardware if you come
around this way even more mods you're
getting all that Jakob oh yeah oh yeah
I'm getting all that even more of it the
beautiful auras graphics cards in here
getting will let's go over here now to
this open starting first on the far
right the X $2.99 or gaming nine this is
their top-of-the-line X $2.99
motherboard to date they have several
features packed into this form factor
here full-size ATX RGB integration
literally everywhere including digital
LED illumination on the far left we'll
talk about that more in a second now the
gaming seven ultra gaming and gaming
three are steps down from the gaming
nine so you won't be paying as much for
these boards but you'll also lose a few
features that you might find crucial you
might not it depends the good thing is
gigabytes giving you a plethora of
options to choose from
all suited for different price points
for those interested in setting a lot of
money to gaming nine will be your best
set the gaming seven leaves with a few
features including that illuminated rear
i/o backplate now one last X $2.99 board
worth mentioning here for an entirely
different reason the UV for of this one
it's kind of a bare-bones X $2.99
motherboard but that's good for some
people not a lot of people are into the
RGB thing they're not into the fancy
back plates and paying extra for things
that really want to bring you that extra
performance motherboards are all about
feature sets anyway so they're entirely
subjective the UD force is a beautiful
board and it doesn't need LEDs to prove
that it's hard for me to resist a
beautiful custom cooled PC and the Lee
and Lee I think this is the Oh 11 which
I just recently built in it's hard to
pull off an orange and white color
combination but with Horus gigabytes
color scheme here they pulled it off
very well here's gigabyte showing off a
little bit but there's nothing wrong
with that they're running a 128
gigabytes
looks like some Corsair Vengeance ddr4
at a
topping 41 33 megahertz folks that's
impressive and stable they're proving it
right on screen now a little bit of X
299 hype here you see they're running a
core i7 but this right here is an i7
7900 X X 299 GPU you can see down here
10 cores 20 threads and that's the CP
that are using to attain this ultra high
ddr4 frequency this is the gigabyte aro
15 probably one of my favorite high end
laptops you can see why it's near
bezel-less display and it's also packing
the latest hardware I mean you got a
nice Evan 7700 HQ GTX 1060 desktop grade
graphics processor and a camera that
doesn't cut off half of your body and
take in half a keyboard in the image so
I really like how they split the
keyboard here that's a big improvement
the gigabyte made over other competitors
my XPS 13 is plagued with camera issues
so I'm glad that they've kind of tweaked
it to look a little better what they've
managed to do here is cram a 15.6 inch
display into a 14 inch form factor which
means that you get more bang for your
buck and you get more real estate screen
wise without compromising on the
versatility and mobility of the laptop
itself it's not very big you could carry
this and be completely fine it's also
pretty dang thin and last but not least
this is the x9 there are a few unique
things about this laptop among which are
the mechanical keyboard that doesn't
look bad at all they've actually done an
excellent job integrating this into the
chassis also dual GTX 1070 GPUs and you
that's right sli 10 70's and an i7 78 20
HK which is an overclockable laptop
grade i7 quad core hyper threaded
processor we take a deep breath after
that one this is a beast of a laptop
there is so much more that we could show
you on this floor gigabyte has an entire
floor an entire suite in the Taipei 101
building dedicated to their new tech
tech that you will see released in the
near future
so we're sorry we couldn't bring you all
of that the video would be way too long
but I am pumped for what they're going
to bring at special thanks to them for
having us even in the first place up
here on the 36th floor
thought this was a pretty cool sculpture
by the way
so we decided to and the clip like that
again thanks to gigabyte
this is science to do thanks for
traveling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
