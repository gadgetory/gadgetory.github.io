right Jacob why come here oh oh well
hopefully that will happen again
so 30 bucks for 600 one that's even
cheaper and you get more wattage I
should get price all right ah yeah no
that one okay
110 70s and stuff that's actually really
something that's very tempting Greg is
that very tempting well it is because
does not look tempting right
this does not look tempting at all are
you kidding me into this now we also
have an EVGA superclocked
that's pretty cool yep still not
tempting now all and we need to get in a
price match what was it online
let's see 950 are actually pretty good
too it's looking like that one right
there
super sugar pot 130 ain't bad hundred
thirty bucks yeah that's our safe forty
so this is what we're looking at right
now this is the the same card on Newegg
that we can put that that's right here
so we're gonna get best buy price-match
that oh yeah look at all these deals
baby oh my gosh it's saving $20 great oh
I'm losing money not buying this right
now
it's look at the awesome looking what is
this do I need this no I already have
one of those don't I what I already have
one of those I know you have look at
this sick blocking keyboard do they know
from your previous best five videos that
this place is actually burned down over
here they don't have the story
why's that actually Jake if we can get
our seven three six if you want why do I
feel like I'm spending a lot more money
than we initially planned no I'm saying
you can get a cheaper car that won't be
as powerful do you spend less money if
you want okay what is that gonna replace
well Greg I don't know okay no keep that
one I like this one yeah
good choice scrap the 480 480 for 130
bucks Greg can't you read it's sale
limited time only we have to buy this
okay we're going in the wrong direction
Greg yeah we are going in the wrong
direction
what's that one I would want yeah but
you don't need to spend this much only
need a 120 gig 120 gigs like all right
let's do how much is that this is 30
this is 140 so we're at 170 that would
make it 250 mark I've grabbed it you
sure yeah whatever it's fine all right
we can always order them on and wait now
Reed if you don't wait up no this is
everything we need yeah actually it is
okay that's fine good yeah all right
what are those American Eagle shoes
yeah the America
that's pretty awful we're not going to
pay for this one great no I'm not
covering you on this glorious I'd stop
but I know the reference so I like you
too I can't I can't imagine having to
stop I just couldn't it like I just got
boring
once I saw that it was close um we all
first match the that's I better make
sure that's a new egg before
no first we did so you're gonna have
if you want new idea if you want you can
put in by backplate and wig and you can
stick the backlight on
that's gonna look so good can I please
get on the microphone and just say
codename sprinkle say sure I'm gonna go
Roger Roger
okay look him up savings we've got Greg
oh my god $80 this is like what he does
I ride motorcycles and drive cars oh I
guess I need a sign oh yeah thanks
Susheela thank you - oh yeah two hundred
fifty five dollars not bad it's not bad
Greg yep I'm sorry what superstrate
illegal towns spent a lot of money Greg
better be worth it just spent a lot of
money
that's what if we go in turn the attempt
to turn the computer on it doesn't even
turn on no it'll be fine
it'd be fine why are you going this way
why are you going to bed why because we
live that way we live over there she
enjoyed that
you know she enjoyed that whoever stir
that was not scripted I did not tell him
to do that for the sake of your - he
just kind of left the clock
spell number Robert but anyway folks we
ended up with some good parts from Best
Buy today we did confirm that Best Buy
will price match they will price match I
know a lot of you already knew that
beforehand and the I was a little
skeptical about it only because I was
tonight at one point but that was
because the item was bundled with a game
but in this case it wasn't we know that
gtx 950 for 130 bucks not bad PNY 240
gig solid state drive for I think 80
bucks and then a 600 watt EVGA bronze
our skill of the day for a whopping
$29.99 so you're sure this is all we
need as far as components because that
looks like it's nothing I feel like
we're not even gonna be able to finish
this build well it's because we have the
other half of the parts already in the
computer we have like two parts it's
like we don't have four four really we
have the CPU the motherboard the RAM and
we have a cooler part why do I feel like
this is just a Medicaid's like we have
like this looks nice I don't know I like
the box I'm pretty sure we're not
forgetting anything so we're gonna get
home you're gonna go crap
I don't yeah I honestly is it give me
something so small all right we got
Jacobs graphics card here gtx 950 this
thing will play anything in 4k 60p just
kidding
oh won't not even close Wow okay well
great Pig great no I mean it's not this
is the one you definitely need this is
all of it you want something that covers
your circuit boards I mean it's more of
like an aesthetic thing but it has some
functionality she got a little tiny one
right here little little small one it's
not bad pretty right he focused oh yeah
mmm
that's part of every build oops that's
right you're that good at revealing hmm
but should be the intro video right
there you just spent $130 trip
congratulations yeah I know I got ripped
tonight you just tack it rip you're
saying sometimes when you want good
stuff or stuff that does what you want
it to do fishing me got everyone to pay
just a little bit doubtful yeah that's
it so Greg coops is that so bust looks
high-quality it's not oh my goodness
look at this you get allowed to be a
little less aggressive with the camera
oh you're out morning I supposed to
shove in people's faces yeah good yeah
that close up Oh ready for this ready
for this yeah epic that was worth a J by
the way your autofocus is terrible right
now you just wanted to keep the camera
more still I know I've read a couple of
the comments I want to see my face
alright Jake are you ready for this
sample is this on it with the top PCIe
16x slot it's the longest one on the
motherboard
make sure the hinge is pushed backwards
that one is and then it just pop her in
boom and you do that make sure that's up
there we go then you want to make sure
the card is as high as possible and you
secure it back to chassis so that you
don't have any graphics card sag or at
least a minimal amount of sag it plugs
us all folks
except in a case like this except is car
doesn't go all the way over so we're not
able to take advantage of that
fortunately uh sag no surprisingly no
say ok the car is actually quite light
it's lighter than I thought PCB is very
small thin aluminum and copper so it's
not a very heavy toward 600 watt is
overkill severe overkill for this this
computer but we got it for 30 bucks
so Jacob feticide ever upgrade anything
in your braking the most
600 watts cover you there you will be
a-ok you're going to stay this time and
help me clean last time you did not help
me clean and I had to take I had to go
to work I had to pick up all of this
crap it took so long dude so I could
like you should actually sleep on my bed
it was a pact please please please plug
this into a surge protected outlet okay
I actually do have one okay just don't
plug it straight to the wall because
power goes out you know something
happens you get a power surge you will
decimate I just tried this hundred
dollar it's not a hundred dollars it's
it's like 350 ish okay
yeah well including the price of the
case it's actually a lot more than that
it's like four hundred actually it's
like five hundred because we have we
also have the radiator up there
oh this this build makes no sense okay
it's built makes zero sense so first off
we have a 600 watt power supply that's
powering a computer that's probably
going to draw no more than 300 watts
from the wall we have a graphics card
paired with a ultra cheap CPU and four
gigs of rams is going in an editing room
by the way I don't recommend four gigs
of RAM for any editing rate except in
your case unless you won't be doing much
in the way of editing you'll just be
more like cropping and pasting all I
guess so inside down because we do have
a best filter on the bottom so you want
the fan going down in this case and
secure it just like that
how's the sweat going this time around
just curious
not as bad sweat free so far I mean very
few people actually complained about you
I am very surprised because now that
I've actually got time to review the
footage I look like I had like
Parkinson's okay would you like to see
how we wire the subject I'm actually not
too curious Greg but I will act
enthusiastic well I wish I could say I'm
excited about this build but I can
already see it not turning on for some
reason it's more bullet don't turn on
find out oh this is a great shot my
vision here looks good actually I get a
bunch of compliments from like 80 year
old patients all the time on how
good luck and you know I take it we can
open up your 240 gig P&amp;amp;Y I kind of want
this instead of what I have which one
what do you have I don't know aim things
at 120
oh that's sucks how's that feel Greg
tell us how does that feel I actually
have something in your rig that is
better than much yeah get it open baby
let's do the power there she is there
she is okay well what what what does
this do
I don't even know with us it's just like
the main power supply power supply no
the solid state of a power supply yeah
we're gonna open up this power supply
now we're gonna Jacob I don't know where
that screw is completely missing I go
don't we need that no okay well I don't
care that okay well actually you're
missing the screw to I don't know
without a win either as long as we need
one and only one then we will be fine
hope hopefully yeah so why is that just
so I can add more yeah if you want to
add more later how high did those go up
to one terabyte you can get higher than
that excellent don't have a 1 terabyte
in my laptop it's a 1 terabyte hard disk
drive yeah that's different
ha ok I mean they do the same thing
essentially but one is much slower than
the other this is all the dirty work
that goes into building a PC all this
right here just the boring stuff nobody
wants you to see we'll show it to you
here on science studio
oh yeah look at that oh my goodness ok
where are we going what are we doing
what is this
ok we're plugging I would like to do on
that backwards we are plugging in your
LED kit ok so you have LEDs in there
nice and flash the LEDs have to show off
my sweet what is this thing called
motherboard motherboard yep show off
that sweet motherboard you know that
wasn't we talked about this I know but
when I'm like on the fly just looks like
you're just ripping them oh yeah this
isn't your personal bully huh f it I
don't need these oh look at that squeeze
ladies and gentlemen look at this room
bedtime oh man
putting the wires to bed here live its
science woman out life science studio
cold air Greg something you've never
heard of in this household I know it's
really hot in here take a hundred ten
degrees so are there like little symbols
on each one that tells you where they go
okay
okay well that makes sense that I didn't
know you ate ten so this would go on up
here okay kind of we're going to try to
squeeze her in this is just an extension
cable so it's nothing special and we're
going to follow just the six pin through
the rubber grommets inside the case here
see your friends around there it is
right there and looks like it plugs in
that way boom there we go actually not
bad looking - I'm actually kind of
surprised I'm sort of starting to come
around with this ugly looking board
it isn't ugly board clearly of it well
you know everything else actually looks
good actually enjoy this case now folks
I'm not a big white colored fan I
actually recommend highly green colors
let's probably one my favorite color
Monster Energy green as you probably see
later once Greg actually posts my
YouTube channel's name I who says I
didn't already post it oh I liked the
video I'm gonna do it now yeah that's
why you said I'm gonna glue this yeah so
um yeah but you know I'm actually
digging you know the white with the
black contrast actually looks pretty
good until you get up here and then
you're like oh wow look at all of the
different color it actually looks like I
have a bunch of room to I put like
action figures in here yeah or are they
gonna mess with like the fans or the
dirt or whatever no you can do that
that's actually I would be but something
big right here if you want
oh yeah you're not going to use these
negatives I think I've gotta use these
too but not the blue ones okay as long
as I have access what's the difference
ah these are a lot faster of course they
are Wow
Greg I forgot Oh God doesn't have USB
3.0 support okay we're eventually gonna
replace how much is a board oh well your
ghost award you're gonna need a new CPU
and new Ram that could be 300 bucks okay
we'll do that later Jacobs on a budget
yeah
as you can totally tell by me just
absolutely destroying that PC over there
to build my semi decent one stay tuned
for part three epic levin's PC building
experience
I'm glad that thing is perfectly metal
fans I have no idea what even a SATA se
ta cables Sheh
I don't know these are data transfer
cable is a semi closed hitting me wow I
was on it so guess where these plug into
it's a motherboard okay and where do
they plug into any opposite side I'm
assuming the little power supply thing
this thing well that's the only thing I
can think of yeah
okay Greg really okay okay a general God
into your graphics guy there we go my
god Greg it's just wedged in there it's
like we're like trolling people thinking
that it's like you know one of the best
pcs ever built this is like actually
completely trash oh yeah oh yeah look at
it I cannot wait for this montage video
