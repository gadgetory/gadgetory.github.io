another Craigslist video or right here
for you
I'm gonna start things off by saying
that I'm gonna do my best from now on to
hide personal information if for
whatever reason for whatever stupid
reason you put your personal address
let's say on a Craigslist post and then
I ended up showcasing it on the channel
I'm just gonna f12 it and then delete
that element if I if I find it I might
not get everything but I'm gonna try my
best to hide as much personal info as
possible even though I don't recommend
you you put anything like that on
Craigslist to begin with I don't think
we're liable for anything like that
we've had people threaten to sue us and
then nothing ever happens because I'm
pretty sure that there's nothing they
can do on a Craigslist ad if they you
know willingly post public information
on a public forum but anyway just to
keep things simple you know I don't want
people to get angry that's just because
we're showing these ads on our YouTube
channel I'm gonna do my best to hide
that stuff so if you see something slip
by maybe phone number address I'm sorry
I've tried my best though to get rid of
most of those elements so we're gonna
start things off with a terrible
craigslist ad and this is one that you
know right away you can just take a
quick look at the PC you really don't
even know look at the specs to know that
this asking price here of $3,000 is just
a tad bit outrageous so it's got listed
here a ZOTAC gtx 1060 and then also from
the same manufacturer a gtx 1070 sure
enough in the picture he has two cars
that look identical but they are not
from an architectural standpoint so you
cannot sli these that's why he has no
sli bridge here he probably figured that
out the hard way so I would recommend if
he bought this PC for whatever stupid
reason you did to sell either of these
cards because you can't use them in
tandem he has an EVGA 750 watt bronze 80
plus power supply okay that's not too
bad intel celeron g30 930 this right
here is a dual core dual threaded
processor there's no hyper threading
onboard this is just missus bare-bones
this is pretty much as bare-bones that
it gets and he wants three grand for it
I almost feel like he's trolling me and
then he has a Z to 70 P for whatever
reason and unlock chipset board with a
seller on G 39 30 he's sure to include
that price because that gets us way
closer to $3,000 he's got a bunch of
other frankly useless stuff here in the
sense that it doesn't come anywhere
close to three grand so he's not really
making a case for himself he even
contradicts himself down here do not
contact me with unsolicited service
and then he clicks the button says it's
ok to contact this poster with services
or other commercial interests so I don't
know I feel like this is a troll but
either way yeah this should just raise
so many red flags even just by looking
at the picture up front not worth three
grand
I wanted to transition into something
that's a bit more reasonable so the
prices you're gonna see in the in these
subsequent ads are actually pretty good
there is one misleading ad I'll get to
in a second but this one here to kick
things off with the you know decently
priced ads is an all-white build for the
most part I would personally paint that
that gigabyte card myself just to make
things a little more cohesive in there
now buddy's got a great color scheme
going on he's using it looks like a deep
cool captain 240 X it's a white AI oh
and he's gonna white almost looks like a
MSI be 350 board yeah all rise in 5 1600
so he's uh let's see let's just break
this down price-wise this is about 200
bucks this is about 500 bucks so let's
say $700 there $800 $900 $1,000 these
right here probably make it $1,100
I wouldn't even price that so 1100 1200
bucks you know you could have the other
things in your Corsair I'm 65 for a
mouse mechanical keyboards he's
including a Steam library of apparently
worth $200 and games could probably
haggle with him just a little bit he
says it would cost you 1700 bucks I'm I
think about a clicking on that I just
kind of break you down on my head this
is not too bad and I'm sure the reason
why is he says is request $1,700 is
because he's got the 1080 in there
priced at like a thousand bucks but
prices are coming down a lot and so I
don't recommend buying you know paying
more than retail for a GTX 1080 at this
point just be patient you'll find
something around MSRP and that's much
better than what you can find on sites
like eBay and Craigslist for those
scalpers trying to make a quick buck on
a graphics card sale you can see he's
pretty much got everything you want in a
Craigslist ad right if he's trying to
sell a PC he's gonna make sure they
takes pictures of everything he's trying
to sell and he does that here I'll be at
the pictures aren't that great of
quality it's got steals here I can't
even tell what that is
SteelSeries it might be a mousepad or
something but you know he's got enough
here enough evidence to show you that
this is PC and these are the
part you're gonna get for the price
you're gonna pay twelve hundred eighty
bucks isn't too bad I'd say that's
around retail price so you'd probably
hag a little bit if he's gonna really
stubborn on that graphics card price you
might have to pay around twelve hundred
bucks for it but I would probably pitch
him a thousand bucks and just see where
his head's at if he says no not a chance
I'm keeping firm at 1280 and you're
probably gonna overpay just a little bit
for this because he's valuing that GTX
280 above MSRP now this when I first
caught me off guard it looked really
interesting in the pictures and then I
saw 69 50 X right here this was a
fifteen hundred dollar retail processor
when I first came out and it's got a gtx
1080 and it's 16 gigs of ram basically
the works and he only wants 1799 bucks
for it you know and it looks like it was
well built got a really weird Zalman
cooler but then I started digging
because I wanted to see how much this
was going for now I'm sure it's
depreciated a lot so let's just do that
it's too high 769 50 X and let's see
what we can buy it for so we have on
eBay here about 850 bucks you see
everywhere else is basically MSRP maybe
a little above MSRP depending on where
it's coming from so let's just say 800
bucks right that's that's a good deal I
guess according to what the markets
telling you right now just lease on
these few shopping sites from Google so
let's price at $800 and then we have a
Zalman cooler here this is gonna be
let's just say a hundred bucks right so
$900 this is 200 bucks
that's $1,100 a 1080 let's price again
at 500 bucks that's $1600 there already
which is almost what he's asking for we
haven't even got a storage and other
things the motherboard and whatnot so
1,600 and then we have a 240 gig SSD
let's say another 60 bucks
so 1660 then a 2 terabyte hard drive
let's say 1720 1730 this this asrock x9
on xtreme3 is probably a couple hundred
bucks so there we're already at the
price he's asking and then we of course
have the case that I'll take view 21 he
doesn't have the power supply listed but
I'm pretty sure it's included and then
he gives you a little disclaimer down
here PC is a monster and will handle
anything a perfect video editing 3d
rendering cat and his production blah
blah blah so it's not too bad it comes
with Windows 10 apparently and you know
he's got he's got actually decent stuff
here you know it's a clean build he's
not asking too much forward you can see
the cooler so big he can't put the
vyx card in the uppermost pci slot but
other than that i mean it's a pretty
conventional beefy system that i think
is actually reasonably priced you could
probably pitch 1600 bucks for this just
assuming that these prices you know this
one at eight hundred bucks and this one
at five hundred are about on par with
fair market value i mean it's already
pretty competitive though so I'm not too
I'm not too too satisfied with this one
you know being that the CPU is really
expensive or used to be really expensive
not bad now this one here is just a
little misleading whenever you see these
like fake pictures or the pictures are
like just the you know market pictures
that look like they're ripped from
Google Images that's what I want you
guys is be as radars to be synced to
right if you see something like this you
need to be aware of it you need to be
very cautious because if you don't have
actual pictures of the product that
you're trying to buy this just this
might not go well and if you don't pay
attention you could be very misled so at
first this looks great right i7 7700
it's a non k mind you 250 GB SSD 16 gigs
of ram I don't see a graphics card
listed here but I do see a price of 725
looks pretty good and check it out the
picture has what looks like an MSI
graphics card so let's assume it's got a
backplate looks pretty beefy let's say
it's just a 1060 that still makes this a
really great deal but if you scroll down
you can see that as a video card is not
actually a video card at all this isn't
discrete graphics this is integrated
graphics intel HD graphics 630 which is
what you find in the 7700 so you get no
graphics card here so I see seven or
twenty-five bucks I mean if we go ahead
and price it you know we can call this
around 250 bucks this is another 200
bucks it's 450 we have an SSD here let's
say $500 I'm not gonna price a sound
card this is a really cheap power supply
maybe 550 he's actually asking a tad bit
more than I would feel comfortable
asking for this because it doesn't come
with a graphics card so he probably sold
the card turned a pretty sweet profit
and trying to break around even for the
rest of the components so I would not
lowball him but I would pitch definitely
lower than what he's asking and he
doesn't have real pictures so that would
probably the first thing I asked him was
like dude send me real pics of your PC
before you know you asked for this
amount of money lastly I want to end on
the state of graphics cards and that
current market
you're still gonna find people like this
right who are trying to flip these cards
big-time unless he bought this card
already at an inflated price which I'm
sure he did
because it looks like he's been using
this for a while this will be a huge
profit Ram he'll profit around 200 300
bucks maybe and that's that's a lot of
money that's a huge profit and if you're
willing to pay that fine good for you
but I wouldn't I would wait this is a
great card from a soos but it's in my
opinion it's not worth 900 bucks even if
it's difficult to find these and you
gotta be really patient and diligent
with where you're looking this is still
a little too much for me so what I would
do is wait a little more do your due
diligence and look everywhere for the
same card or a comparable card that's
priced less that would be your best bet
buying one use especially at this price
way above MSRP is just that's not my cup
of tea
so with that folks I want to know what
you guys think in the comments below I
would also like your suggestions for
future Craigslist topics maybe even
Craigslist links to pcs and other
components that you think are either
outrageously priced or are really great
deals that you would like me to
publicize in a future video on the I
read playlist I really enjoy making
these videos because we often cover the
academic stuff on this channel but this
is more of a street smarts video right
it's how to deal with with buyers and
sellers online how to think logically
and and you know how to just use your
brain when it comes to everyday
transactions with the used components
you know and don't overpay don't spend
more than MSRP unless you really have to
and the markets being gouged like it has
been with a graphics cards and RAM
recently and and most importantly make
sure that you can engage in these
transactions in public places only use
cash if possible only deal with cash I
should say and make sure that you do
your due diligence
I tried saying that like three or four
takes before this and I always kept
messing up due diligence do your due
diligence what I mean by that is make
sure that the components work or do your
best to make sure that they work before
you give somebody your cash if you liked
this video be sure to let me know buy
this one a thumbs up I appreciate thumbs
