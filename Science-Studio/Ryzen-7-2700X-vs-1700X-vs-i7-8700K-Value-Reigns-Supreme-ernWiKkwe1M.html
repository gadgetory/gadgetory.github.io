past three or so days in an effort to
compile as much data as possible into a
single video without wasting 30 minutes
of your time so let's get started with
the horizon 2700 X CPU the subject of
today's video I've got about a dozen or
so gaming benchmarks to throw your way
along with the view synthetics I even
have an Adobe Premiere render benchmark
if interested in content creating with
the CPU and I'll also have a few talking
points at the end we can extract from
this data my test bench is today
consists of the three CPUs listed in the
title this video which I hope you read
along with respective Z and X chipset
boards and 16 gigabytes of Corsair
Vengeance RGB Ram clock to 3000
megahertz all three CPUs were cooled
with a deep pool captain 360 exa IO and
all games were benchmarked in tandem
with the EVGA 1070 Ti for the win -
triple slot graphics card this one's
beefy alright but she stays nice and
quiet under load horizon 720 700 X a
part of the family codenamed Pinnacle
Ridge is an improvement on an
architectural level over its 1000 series
counterparts and it shows to compare it
to the 1700 X because it falls a right
in line from a nomenclature standpoint
and should from a price standpoint as
well the new 12 nanometer process
results in an evident IPC jump around 5%
or so in my testing it might be a bit
higher depending on what you're doing
and at no expense of additional power
and even when overclocked well beyond 4
gigahertz the CPU stayed well within my
comfort zone from a temperature
standpoint this was a relief since the
two boards included in my reviewer kit
from AMD included supplemental 4 &amp;amp; 8 pin
EPS ports and on top of the you know
standard 8 pin port consumers have not
seen anything like this since X 299 but
fear not I recorded only 150 watts of
peak power draw from the 12 volt leads
on both EPS cables while torture testing
with Prem 95 signifying an only marginal
jump in power demand with the new
architecture now a few things to keep in
mind before moving to the benchmarks the
1700 X was clocked to 4 gigahertz in all
scenarios the 2700 X was clocked at 4.2
gigahertz unless otherwise stated and
the 8700 K to 5 gigahertz this is again
across all course the 1070 Ti it was
left at stock frequencies so let's start
things off with Cinebench r15
essentially a thread image render tool
these scores rely on architectural
efficiency and clock speed we can see
the I beseech
from the 1700 X to the 2700 X in a
relative sense via the blue bars to the
left
since these tests were conducted at the
same frequency 159 to 171 isn't too
substantial but the overclocking
Headroom on top of this is where the
money is I was able to push mine to 4.2
gigahertz across all eight cores on 1.38
five volts and a level one load line
calibration the result is a whopping
nineteen hundred and five see beyond the
multi-core side of things practically
dwarfing that of the 8700 k where the
blue team shines however is overclock
ability of course five gigahertz pushes
at single core performance well above
200 CB which is why it has remained at
the gaming King up to this point but
focusing more on the improvements with
risin Geekbench four gives us a closer
look at the kinds of raw horsepower
gains one should experience when
migrating from arisin one the additional
overclocking Headroom at the expense of
marginal power loads is a huge win for
the second gen stuff that and i can
finally use XMP profiles without my
entire PC shutting down this was always
a complaint I had with Rison one from a
content creation standpoint the Rison
720 700 x renders a five-minute 1080p
video clip 60fps mind you and
practically the same time as its higher
clocked blue team counterpart clock for
clock the red team has this one in the
bag you can even stream netflix while
you're at it just to be cocky the first
game on our list as always is Grand
Theft Auto 5 all games by the way have
been tested in a 1080p resolution it's
the most common by far and it does
leverage CPU and GPU power fairly evenly
across the board GTA 5 is an excellent
port for what it is and this one yields
some of the best gains for the 2700 X
over the 1700 X jumping from 109 to 133
and then only an extra 6 FPS on average
between the 2700 X and the 8700 K it's
pretty phenomenal although as 1% and 0.1
percent of all frame rates are also
maintained here which is where the
boosted clock speech really shines pub G
is up next optimization isn't yet on
point so in game settings were lowered
in most places to compensate the 8700 K
performs the best year but only barely
only a 6 FPS Delta between it and the
2,700 X for both average and 1% charting
again pretty incredible the 2700 X does
fall a bit short though in the lowest
1% of frames which could be the results
of any number of variables including how
my own gameplay played out since nothing
in this benchmark was truly standardized
moving from pub gene out a fortnight's
Battle Royale in 1080p with a high
preset things are looking up across the
board 166 FPS on average for the 8700 K
146 for the 2,700 X and 139 for the 1700
X the gap between Intel and AMD widens
just a bit with this title and it
certainly runs smoother on the i7 up
next is doom tested an OpenGL for
benchmarking purposes where we see a
similar story with respect to averages
until takes the cake here and oddly
enough the 2,700 X suffered tremendously
down low with its lowest 1% and 0.1% of
frame x I'd like to test a Vulcan in the
future to see how this fares out I'm not
too sure at this point what attributed
to the dip and frame rates down low
F 1 2017 has a great built-in benchmark
I always run the Australian map in heavy
rain to load up the hardware and things
in this case spread out just a bit more
Intel still on top but a clear advantage
exists with the 2700 X over the last gen
sure the minimum was a tad lower but
things looked especially smooth in game
and for all we know that 92 could be an
outlier which is why percentage based
framerate charting is generally more
representative of overall trends
universe in box 2 is a relatively
demanding title for what it is thanks to
active algorithms and particle mapping
and in the same earthen sphere of Moon
simulation that I always use the 2,700 X
fell massively short of the gaming King
86 on average compared to a mere 60
however things down low are much closer
30 verse 29 for the lowest 1% and 27
verse 21 for the lowest point 1% rise of
the Tomb Raider in DirectX 12 is another
title I was interested in testing due to
its inherent Nvidia bias so I was
curious to see how things would play out
the 2,700 X actually lost to the 1700 X
in one of the scenarios but pulled ahead
in the latter two while staying within
10 or so frames of the 8700 K on the
other side battlefield 1 is a game in
which we should expect extra cores to do
us a solid and it certainly plays out
that way the 2700 X is only 4 frames shy
of the 8700 K on average falling
slightly further behind with the lower
tiers a 10 FPS Delta at 1% and 16 at
0.1%
still though we see noticeable gains
over the 1700 x8 cores and 16 threads
clocked only 200 megahertz higher than a
baseline can make a heck of a difference
on top of added architectural benefits I
threw in planet coaster for fun because
it's actually pretty intensive in the
ultra preset even on the CPU the trends
are to be expected but the 8700 K does
pull away with the lower frame rate
percentages and lastly which are three
in especially graphics intensive title
the 2700 X average 112 fps leading the
1700 X by only 5 frames and falling
short of the 8700 K by 8 a similar story
continues further down the line but it
should be noted that numerical
improvements Canon do exist with the
2700 X / Gen 1 architecture so AMD is
getting awfully close to outperforming
the 8700 K the gaming king in major
titles all the while boasting additional
cores and competitive prices for that
multitasking fun speaking of which
that's been rise ins calling all along
value and multitasking they never
claimed to be the best gaming CPUs in
the market they're just clearly better
value CPUs and with the 2700 X closing a
5% frame rate margin on average between
itself and the 8700 K things are only
looking better at this point the
platform's had several months to mature
2nd gen chips or backwards compatible
with last year's boards something Intel
should seriously pick up on and pricing
is well attractive no other word for it
so I want to close with a few additional
remarks regarding my experience with the
platform and with the 2700 X in
particular I haven't by the way even
pulled the 2600 X out of its box I'll
get to that one shortly this video is
all about the 2700 X but what I've
noticed is that these CPUs don't really
run as hot as I expected them to I don't
think I had the best overclocker though
I think 4.2 gigahertz across all cores
is pretty meh just considering one core
at least will turbo to 4.3 it's what it
says on the box anyway I haven't
actually checked that because I
overclocked immediately but it's
impressive but it's it just really
depends on the chip it's more or less a
silicon lottery luck of a draw type
thing and if you get a really good chip
Wow you're gonna be into 2000 CV
territory for centre bench and I imagine
your frame rates will be just neck and
with that of the 8700 KS and there's
something else the msi board I used
decided to pump 1.52 volt under the Auto
config to the CPU v core which is just a
bit uncomfortable I think 1.5 is
definitely too high not just for the 360
ml but also the V RMS and the CPU itself
right so the board did get pretty hot
under torture workloads with prime95
even at one point 4 volts or thereabouts
where I had it which is something to
keep in mind the temperatures weren't
too bad but having a top-down CPU cooler
an air cooler in particular would keep
those VRMs nice and cool if you have
some intakes or exhaust fans at the top
of your case that will also do your V
RMS a solid now from a value standpoint
Pinnacle Ridge definitely has it you can
pick up the 2700 X 4 anything near 300
USD you'll be sitting good in the value
neighborhood in my book almost as good
as feeling like you're ripped off a used
car salesman which let's be honest
really doesn't happen too much this CPU
is a steal for the suggested retail
price of 329 and should pose a worthy
upgrade for anyone touting architecture
as far back as I would say Ivy Bridge
and maybe even piledriver bulldozer if
you're looking for a workstation a
multitasking CPU that can still write
games in 1080p and up then the 2700 X is
for you don't be afraid by the way to
check it out via the link below at least
consider it
especially for on an older platform now
I want to know what you think its
pinnacle Ridge something you're
considering how do you feel about the
platform especially after watching this
video and other reviewer videos out
there and invite you to comment down
