building he or she doesn't just start
building it has to be designed first it
requires blueprints and if the building
is especially tall it requires several
hundred blueprints same goes for game
developers they don't simply envision
some epic game and then immediately
begin playing it ridiculous and heading
serious developer would be offended if
that was all but you thought they did
to connect this analogy blueprints for
game designers are api's application
programming interfaces Direct X as we
know it today is a library packed full
of api's and without it most of the
games you likely play wouldn't exist
let's start off with API in short
picture a district attorney by the name
of I don't know Sam Sam represents the
video game coder Sam has been practicing
law for twenty years but he doesn't know
everything every now and then he has to
refer to state and federal law books to
ensure that he's properly prosecuting
these laws are essentially the codes by
which he must abide and venturing
outside of these guidelines could be
catastrophic for his particular case or
even career you get no argument from me
there but if your obstruction allows a
massacre to happen I will crucify you
mr. Kralik I will charge you with
negligent homicide and after I convict
you I'll resign my job and represent the
families of the victims in a wrongful
death suit against you in the Union by
the time I'm done you'll be finished
much in the same way an application
programming interface is a guy that
programmers should follow when designing
video games around a particular platform
and in the case of DirectX that platform
or operating system rather is Windows
now DirectX in and of itself isn't a
single API it's actually a collection of
them rules and regulations if you will
for various media including audio video
and games direct sound direct play and
direct3d have all been integral api's of
DirectX in the past however for the sake
of this video and for the sake of gaming
we'll be focusing primarily on direct3d
as it's the API responsible for 3d
graphics generation when a developer
utilizes direct3d he or she is opening
up a world of endless possibilities the
API allows for the utilization of
onboard and discrete graphics which
we'll discuss more detail in just a sec
making for a user-friendly 3d interface
perfect for game coders who require
visual representations of what they're
actually coding in the API
direct3d is currently at odds
OpenGL a similar 3d graphics API
although most of what you'll see today
and play today will rely on Direct X
speaking of which how does DirectX take
advantage of graphics hardware is
DirectX partial towards one graphics
card manufacturer or the other and what
is the difference or what are the
differences between DirectX 11 and
DirectX 12 let's start with question one
how does DirectX take advantage of
graphics cards it's actually quite
simple when a programmer writes a code
within direct3d that requires a solid
sphere let's say to rotate Windows will
utilize the DirectX 3d API to instruct
the primary display device typically a
dedicated graphics card to execute the
program code for instance the code may
require the use of shader pipelines
within a GPU I discuss processor
pipelines in more detail in the video
right here
it may also request that anti-aliasing
hardware and other blending effects
begin working at a hardware level to
generate the rotating sphere and as long
as the graphics card in question is
relatively new and not a potato when it
comes to gaming performance these
commands will be executed almost
instantaneously and without fail if
however your card was not designed with
either DirectX 11 or 12 in mind windows
and in the case of DirectX 12 Windows 10
will inform you that no discrete display
adapter is available to utilize that API
picture like a foreign language the
Arafa card cannot comprehend nor
interpret if good old District Attorney
Sam can't read his own law books how on
earth is he supposed to prosecute now
let's tackle question 2 is DirectX
partial towards one graphics card
manufacturer well in all fairness this
question is actually worded a bit
incorrectly since DirectX particularly
direct3d and graphics cards are always
evolving in all ways proving it's
difficult to gauge whether the display
card manufacturer or the API developers
or a fault per se at any given time in
the case of DirectX 11 it has been noted
that Nvidia takes the cake and
especially moderate resolutions 1080 and
720p this however is not the fault of
DirectX but rather the fault of AMD
don't shoot me red fans just hear me out
things will get better for you
GC &amp;amp; Architecture heavily favors
something known as parallelism in which
several thousand graphics cores handle
large workload simultaneously but in
order to do this efficiently GCN demands
a great deal of CPU horsepower to feed
the graphics card information if the CPU
has read weak cores or simply not enough
of them the AMD counterpart will suffer
to a greater
and under the DirectX 11 library which
was designed to fully utilize a maximum
of two cores this is why owners of AMD
graphics cards attest to Intel CPUs
yielding much higher frame rates than
their AMD counterparts since Intel CPUs
have higher IPC's and generally stronger
single cores then let's say the FX
lineup from AMD they're able to process
and send more data to the hungry open CL
frameworks of AMD GPUs essentially the
less extreme the cpu bottleneck the more
advantageous owning an AMD graphics card
becomes from Nvidia standpoint CUDA
technology is designed to process and
execute in a much more linear pattern
benefiting platforms with a greater deal
of CPU overhead ie DirectX 11 since CPUs
are designed to process data swiftly in
small diverse chunks and since CUDA is
designed to handle serial operations at
a generally faster rate than that of
OpenCL NVIDIA edged out additional
DirectX 11 performance gains whereas AMD
was crippled by its rather far-fetched
and futuristic technology however
DirectX 12 and the new direct3d api have
sought to change that incomes question 3
how exactly are DirectX 11 and DirectX
12 different well as DirectX has evolved
from its early 2 &amp;amp; 3 versions up to its
pre teen years Hardware overhead has
dramatically increased but this is
actually on purpose graphics cards are
growing more and more powerful by the
second every new release is a giant leap
forward the GTX 1080 is a prime example
now what DirectX 12 seeks to do
primarily is two things this o is
substantially larger deal of graphics
rendering responsibilities directly upon
the CPU and increase the number of fully
UI CPU cores this reduces CPU
bottlenecking and latency obviously
while at the same time maximizing
graphics card Hardware asynchronous
compute 2 comes to mind but that is for
an entirely separate crash course you
gonna take it DirectX 12 is also the
reasons many assume the FX lineup
notably the FX 6300 and the FX 8350
would have a sudden resurgence thanks to
their many integer course and while this
may be the case in theory we have yet to
fully understand how the 12th version of
direct3d utilizes these relatively weak
course as more DirectX 12 based games
are released this should become more
clear but in the case of graphics
processing DirectX 12 undeniably favors
AMD this isn't just coming from a
scientific standpoint that
world observations out there as well in
this scenario it's the API that favors
the graphics hardware although you could
look at this from a different
perspective that Nvidia CUDA technology
wasn't changed to a great enough degree
to benefit from DirectX 12 in the same
way AMD has who saw this coming 10 years
ago
regardless AMD has the edge this time
around and that's thanks to fully
realized asynchronous compute Hardware
reduced driver overhead and maximized
parallelism parallelism parallelism if
you liked what you saw in this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
light be sure to click the subscribe
button have it ready stay tuned for more
crash courses here on the channel sorry
folks no gtx 1060 stuff today I guess
we're just not glorious enough to be
noticed by Nvidia at this point we'll
change that hopefully at some point but
for now least your pros on DirectX right
this is science studio thanks for
learning this
