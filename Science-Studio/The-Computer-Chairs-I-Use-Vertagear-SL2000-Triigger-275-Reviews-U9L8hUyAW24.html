chair I'm sitting in it recently changed
and I could have been happier about the
decision me too the verdict your s-line
SL mm a premium combination of form and
function now I should clarify before the
vultures swoop in and yell sponsored
this is sponsored content do you know
that I'm not being paid for these
reviews verdadera merely wanted to send
a couple of chairs over for my
impressions if you ask me a paid review
is an eight review at all at this point
I could basically say whatever I want
about these chairs I already have them
so there's not much to lose on my end
but I'm 100% willing to say that this
company creates quality products the FL
2000 and trigger 275 are no exceptions
now you've probably already seen a few
vertigo chair reviews most of those were
positive and for good reason both of
these chairs shipped in three parts
meaning that assembly was quick and
rudimentary one of them was completely
to Liz as well the boxes they shipped in
were very large so do keep that in mind
now let's start off with the smaller of
the two chairs the trigger 275 there are
two eyes in its name so I'm not sure how
it's pronounced I'll just be saying
trigger from now on so this one did not
require any tools for assembly which was
nice to see it's dubbed with 275 because
over 275 individual components were
quote meticulously assembled together to
construct the astonishingly beautiful
chair that's verdict you're Tooting its
own horn a bit but these claims do hold
up in court many would argue that this
chair is the more ergonomic of the two
thanks to its low-profile adjustable
lumbar support and a flexible frame you
can choose from four different trim
colors white gray red or blue and two
feature sets as well the trigger 350 is
the larger and more expensive of the two
in the gaming series I find the 275 to
be very tasteful its wheels feel almost
frictionless across even carpet an
included incline pedal is conveniently
placed under the armrest and height
adjustment is controlled on the other
side no annoying bars to reach for
underneath the seat about time someone
tackles this design flaw there's also a
button on the bottom frame that allows
for forward and backward adjustment
useful especially for those who are tall
or looking to lean back a bit more it's
wrapped in DuPont PT EE a flexible mesh
which means it'll stand up to even
aggressive hydraulic forces don't expect
much wear and tear over the years with
this one
now let's discuss the s-line SL mm this
one like the 275 is the slimmer model in
its series so they're like other racing
chairs it's quite tall and heavily
padded as mentioned earlier assembly was
a breeze one tool four bolts and a bit
of heavy lifting by far the best
experience I've had with assembling a
racing style gaming chair it's wrapped
in a stain and water resistant PVC
leather synthetic but fragile from top
to base the trade-off here of course
losing a bit of durability and
breathability for resistivity which is
actually a good thing if you like to
spill drinks let's say you drink a lot
of kool-aid red kool-aid for example if
you spill it on this chair even this
white chair model you'll be hard-pressed
to leave a stain you'll also be
hard-pressed to find an affordable
natural leather gaming chair let alone a
natural leather chair in general so my
reaction to the SL 2000 is also very
positive but for different reasons than
the trigger many proclaim that organ
Amish airs like the trigger are more
comfortable to sit in
the stretching material wraps around
your backside in a way that no racing
chair could however the SL 2000 is
different than most racing chairs in
this regard I'm a skinny guy with a slim
profile and the 2000 is built
accordingly there are also wider models
in the same category but because it's
built with my frame in mind I actually
find this chair to be more comfortable
than the ergonomic 275 super incline is
possible the PVC is still soft and
comfortable and the wheels glide just as
easily as the triggers do there aren't
any awkward spaces between my back and
the chair and long-term sitting doesn't
give me the same ache I've felt in other
less fitted chairs I don't have much to
complain about
save the armrests I wish manufacturers
would move away from this nasty plastic
feeling cover and instead wrap the rest
with protec for the rest of the chairs
made of in this case PVC leather and
since these arm rests are more likely to
make contact with bare skin particularly
in short sleeve shirts and tank tops
you'll notice the cheaper material more
here than you would anywhere else the
triggers are also made of the same
material mind you so it seems like a
cost-saving measure this isn't something
I want to see in a $300 gaming chair I'm
not knocking on Strictly verdaguer here
a lot of computer chairs use the exact
same material for their armrests I just
wish the verdict here would change this
for these lineups these trays would be
perfect if that was the case I've linked
the two chair showcased here in the
video description the s-line SL 2000 and
trigger
seventy-five aren't cheap by any means
but that's what you should expect from
vertigo you're paying for quality
whereas in most cases you're paying for
compensation for those who sit in front
of a computer daily for an office job I
recommend the trigger series but for
those who consistently game in the
comfort of their own homes in my humble
opinion the s-line series should be
strongly considered remember I would
never recommend a product I wouldn't
personally use it's why I've made it a
point to use the SL 2004 found on oh the
past fifty videos or so I also use the
trigger 375 by the way but that one is
in the living room for that computer if
you like this video we're like the
products be sure to give this one a
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
