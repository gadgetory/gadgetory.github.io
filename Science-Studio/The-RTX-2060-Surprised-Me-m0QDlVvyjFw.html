card it boasts the same GPU as its
bigger brother the 2070 but with only
1920 active CUDA cores versus 23:04 and
while the 2070 sports eight gigs of VRAM
which is a fair amount for a card of its
caliber the 2060 comes equipped with
only six as such memory bandwidth has
reduced RT intenser cores are stripped
down and TDP follow suit but so does the
price this is perhaps the first
affordable I say that in very bold
quotation marks affordable r-tx graphics
card and I mean when seen in the context
of $350 MSRP right now you can buy it
for over 400 bucks in a few cases here
in the states and even more if we're
talking about internationally it's
difficult for me to say affordable but
I'm saying it anyway because when seen
in the context of other r-tx graphics
cards
this one is affordable so then what is
my verdict on the RT X 2060
well my conclusion might surprise you
so my thinking behind these upcoming
tests was this the architects 2016 needs
to perform as good as a GTX 1084 the
purchase to make sense before the
decline of Pascal stock you could pick
up one of these for around 350 to 400
dollars so a new card from Nvidia this
price point should perform at least as
good as its predecessor all right why
would you pay more for Less performance
so you could make a similar case for the
launch prices of the ten seventy ten
seventy TI and those are still valid
cards to compare the 20 60 to but the
conditions there are a bit less strict
because those cards are a bit weaker and
we're talking about launch prices versus
current prices and I think it's fair to
base things off of current prices even
though these are dwindling in stock just
because you know this card was like 600
bucks brand new right now it's down to
$400 it's more relevant to the buyer
today and look I don't want to give this
card any more breathing room than it
deserves in this review I take that
approach to all reviews because that's
what you deserve as the viewer I won't
be sugarcoating anything here
aesthetically I think the founders 2060
is a beautiful card a few odd quirks
firstly the 8-pin supplemental power
connector resides on the right face of
the card which means it'll face toward
the front your case and since the PCB
doesn't reach this far over the plug is
actually an extension purely a cosmetic
play from Nvidia start to keep the front
face clean and depending on who you are
you may love or hate this the GeForce
r-tx text has a mirror finish but glows
neon green when powered on it can be
disabled with software but the color
itself cannot be changed the back plate
is beautiful highlighted in a silver
that seems to stand out more so than
reference cards of years past it won't
work with every build color scheme I
understand that but it's definitely
flashy and looks great in our case for
example the rear i/o plate is a matte
black as well following suit with its
bigger brothers my only complaint back
here is the lack of a third DisplayPort
port instead we get good old DVI I
wonder how many people who buy this card
will actually use this interface oh and
in case you're wondering this card
doesn't have any sag at all which is
good it means it's very sturdy and rigid
it's not gonna you know pull that PCI
slot with it oh that it's cringy to look
at so the card feels great looks great
who cares like it's heavy
apparently it's a major pain to
disassemble fine whatever I don't
believe many people will bother
swap out thermal paste on a 60 series
card anyway but so far I'd say I'm
pretty impressed but again who cares
this is not stuff that is pertinent to a
graphics card in terms of its viability
in the market I think it more less comes
down to performance so that's where
gaming comes in can it compete with a
GTX 1084 benchmarks the same system was
used throughout and consists of an i-5
80 600 K 16 gigs of DDR 4 and an ASUS
Maximus 10 hero is e 370 motherboard if
you're wondering why I chose a core i5
in this case the rationale involved the
target audience I felt as though a
majority of potential r-tx 2060
customers would end up pairing this with
either a core i5 horizon 7 or Rison 5
CPU more light more likely rising 5 than
the rise of 7 but still the i-5
generally outperforms the Rison
counterparts and games
so the CPU would impose less of a
bottleneck in most of the titles tested
and I should note we weren't CPU limited
in any of the games you're about to see
so it's really a non-issue I mean you
might have gotten an extra 2 or 3 frames
if we had bumped up to an i7 counterpart
more or less again a moot point I just
want these tests to be as realistic as
possible the only variable here is of
course the graphics card to the arc TX
2060 was swapped for our GT X 1080 super
clock from EVGA it's a reference card
with a similar cooler and double fan
design it's this one right here both
cards support a supplemental 8 pin VGA
connector and match it's on the side and
run it around the same temperature under
load the our TX 2060 reached 74 degrees
Celsius after an hour of gaming and this
card I believe reached 71 so not bad for
a reference card it's actually in the
system right next to me so that's why I
don't have it in my hand but I mean
especially when compared to an
aftermarket cooler like this granted it
is the stock the reference PCB it's not
bad oh and one more thing all of our
tests were conducted in the 1440p ultra
wide resolution or 34 40 by 1440 in
terms of total pixel count that still
keeps us much closer to standard 1440p
rather than 4k but this should keep our
graphics card heavily leveraged
throughout our tests I generally test in
1440p but this will push the cards just
a bit more it won't hurt anything ultra
wide fans we haven't forgotten about you
now on to the games up first is as usual
in GTA 5 in the high preset without AAA
or advanced graphics our GT X 1080
pushed 136 frames per second on average
with the 2060 falling only slightly
behind at 1
31 things were very close here and
remember we're pushing around five
million pixels this is much closer than
I thought it would be and your typical
viewer wouldn't be able to discern
between the two side-by-side can you
pick the gtx 1080 run I'll give you a
few seconds yeah good luck with this one
up next was doom running in the Vulcan
API again the GTX 1080 edged out a very
slight victory but across the board both
cards held their own our lowest 1% of
frame rates still averaged about 120 fps
and the lowest point one percent
averaged above 100 so this is more than
satisfactory here's a side-by-side of
each game again and you can try your
best to figure out which is which
next is f1 20:17 here we see our r-tx
2060 falling behind for the first time
specifically with respect to the lowest
point 1% of frames we aren't sure what
exactly caused this our frame buffer had
some breathing room and thermal
throttling wasn't an issue at all I was
monitoring temps the entire time
although these cards tend to kind of
clock themselves based on temperature
there was no severe throttling issue
that's what I meant to say even after
three passes of this we were seeing the
exact same dip the lowest point one
percenter frame so I'm gonna call this
an optimization issue and I mean F 1
2017 was released in 2017 so it's been a
while next up is shadow of the Tomb
Raider here things are pretty much
neck-and-neck
despite our GPU being the severe
bottleneck in this case the RT X 2060
did an admirable job keeping up with the
Pascal giant now pub G is a weird one
it always is it's come a long way since
launch but still needs a fair share of
optimization this is expressed in our
lowest Pullman percent of frames where
things actually took a drastic turn
south for our GT X 1080 I couldn't call
this the norm definitely the exception
so depending on our config these random
stutters could make or break this game
for you
witcher 3 is a very GPU intensive title
even without mods and if there's any
difference between these cards this game
will show that and in the ultra preset
less hair works it gets very difficult
the GTX 10 eighties extra cuda cores and
slightly higher clock speed win without
a doubt this time and at these lower
frame rates every single one counts 65
verse 59 on average narrows to a 5 fps
split among the lowest 0.1% of frames
this isn't a terrible disparity but it's
a bit easier to tell the difference
between the two when they're running
side-by-side at a much lower average
frame rate ok so ultimately the r-tx
2060 loss to our GT X 1080 but it's the
margins by which it lost that have me so
surprised I seriously expected this card
to fall significantly further behind the
mark but does that mean the 2060 is
worth its hefty 60 series price tag this
is without a doubt the most expensive 60
Series card we've ever seen depends on
how you look at it and for just the
graphics card and assuming a $350 price
tag for the 2016 that's giving it a
slight edge I understand and a $40 price
tag for the 1080 the r-tx 2060 comes in
at around 1.7 frames per dollar with the
GT X 1080 coming in at just under 1.6
frames per dollar
factoring in an additional $600 for each
system build the r-tx 20 60 PC earns
around point six to four frames per
dollar while the GTX 1080p C earns 0.625
so yeah for all intents and purposes
when seen in the context of the entire
system the values of these cards are
almost identical and is that a bad thing
not really in my opinion it just I mean
look it's no ten seventy right this
isn't 980ti performance for the value of
a 70 series card and the same light this
isn't 980 performance and value in a 10
60 especially for the price because
Pascal cards were comparatively cheaper
but what is worth noting is that we're
getting almost GT X 1080 performance for
between 60 and 70 series prices it's
honestly not that bad and it leads me to
conclude that the RT X 2060 is a decent
buy for the money it isn't great but
seeing as though we don't have much from
the red team to compete with right now
I mean rate on seven come on after my
own testing I'd say it's a win for
buyers in the market for a solid 1440p
graphics card you don't have to agree
with me but based on my own test and my
somewhat extensive you know I guess
experience with graphics cards I would
say this is a pretty fair buy so be sure
to leave a comment down below with your
current graphics card and whether or not
you intend to upgrade also whether or
not you agree with my conclusion this is
actually a decent card for the money
like this video if you thought it was
cool click the red button if you're
feeling lucky and stay tuned for more
content like this also stay tuned for
the rumors regarding the 1660 1660 T I
apparently basically r-tx 2060s without
arcane tensor course notice I didn't
test battlefield 5 in this video I also
didn't test the Metro Exodus apparently
that did that just rolled out like today
so I didn't test the two games that
officially support DX R or H racing and
that's because I don't think this card
is ready for that yet I'm going to give
it a few more weeks before I come back
to this topic because obviously if I
tested the GTX 1080 and the RT X 2060
with DX are enabled in battlefield 5 the
RT X 2060 would would would steal it
easily because this card is not built
for that kind of stuff you can't handle
that because those dedicated cores
aren't present in Pascal GPUs but when I
have a few more cards on hand with which
to compare maybe optimization and
takes hold a bit more with the few games
that do support the XR I'll revisit this
and see if the 2060 is at all viable for
rage racing games
this is science to do thanks for
