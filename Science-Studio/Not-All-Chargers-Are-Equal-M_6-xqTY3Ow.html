seven right here and each is slightly
different in terms of power delivery
this beckons a brief lecture in
electrical circuits got your pens and
notepads ready folks here we go on the
face of every power brick you'll find a
bunch of jumbled words and letters that
most of us to be quite frank often
overlooked as long as my device charges
that's all I care about
exclaimed sour Sally I like to take
things nice and slow man and so does my
phone when it you know like come to
charging and whatnot proclaims stoner
Stewie no said no one ever with the
exception of an increase in both battery
temperature and dendrite which are
entirely separate yet non pivotal issues
for the most part we want fast phones
are now coming out with quick charging
capabilities and that's nice and all but
why can't I use just any old charging
brick well for that matter why can't I
use my computer's own USB ports well you
can and there's nothing stopping you
from doing so but there are very evident
downsides to these cue the circuits
lesson so there are three basic terms
you need to know power amperage and
voltage power is defined as the product
of amperage and voltage that's
essentially all you need to know your
phone's charging time is determined by
the amount of power supplied to its
battery and the Chargers job to convert
and deliver a specific amount of power
to the device in question find an e old
power brick you've got lying around
maybe when you're using in your phone at
this very moment and scan for a cluster
of letters and numbers typically
engraved or printed directly on the
charger itself you should see the words
input and output for any device that
plugs into a wall depending on where you
live the input line should read
something like 100 to 240 volts 50/60
Hertz etc this is unimportant
it's the output line that you want to
pay close attention to here things will
vary depending on the break you're
looking at first should be the voltage
for almost any break that connects via a
USB hub to your phone this should be
somewhere around 5 volts it's the
universal standard for USB however the
amperage you'll read denoted by the
capital letter A will be unique this
value could be anywhere from point 2
amps to upwards of 3 amps and that my
friends is where size matters with the
exception of turbo chargers and special
power delivery systems all power bricks
for the USB interface will deliver X
amount of power where X is again voltage
times amperage in most cases voltage is
5 which means that you'll mainly want to
be focusing on amperage to determine how
much
power also defined in SI units as a
joules per second or watts are being
supplied to your phone from said power
brick these power bricks here are rated
from point 4 amps or 400 milliamps to
0.85 amps and have a relatively low
power output this one here delivers
approximately one point seven six watts
of power and this one here delivers four
point three four watts so you can see
that subtle changes in amperage even
while the voltage remains relatively
constant results in a substantial change
in power delivered to your phone check
this one out
this aki amp five way charger delivers a
grand total of 12 watts of power through
each of its four USB 3.1 headers and a
few devices USB type-c compatible
variable power delivery between ten
point eight and nineteen point five
watts this Motorola turbo charger
depending on your device's
specifications can deliver up to a
staggering twenty five point eight watts
crazy but okay Greg that's fine and
dandy and all some bricks deliver more
power to your phone so what show me the
numbers that's what I'm about to do I
use three devices a Motorola X pure and
Apple iPhone 5s and a galaxy s4 I think
it's a fair spectrum of phones to test
with I also used five charging ports the
Motorola turbo charger which came out of
the Moto X pure box by the way the Aki
amp charger a point eight five amp
generic power brick a 1m port on my
stereo receiver and a USB 2.0 port on my
personal computer which delivers only
2.5 watts of power at five volts and
point five amps I allowed each phone to
completely charge to 100% timing each
with a stopwatch I then would do as much
as I could on the phone including
running Geekbench over and over keeping
the LED on and streaming music in the
background until the phone died and will
not turn on again and then switch it up
with a different charger I charged all
three phones on all five Chargers the
exception being the iPhone 5s and the
Motorola turbo charger since the charger
is the ability to deliver more than five
volts it cannot use the USB interface
which means I cannot connect my
lightning cable to the brick no big deal
though that's why I have the Samsung in
the loop anyway here we go
so let's run through the first set of
graphs well first the one app receiver
in 25 amp generic brick times were
relatively consistent across the board
and this should have been the case the
iPhone charged the quickest perhaps due
to its significantly smaller battery
size followed by the Moto X and lastly
the Galaxy s4
average time was roughly 350 minutes or
just under 6 hours that may seem a bit
long but if you think about it that's a
short enough charge cycle to be used
while you're sleeping at night assuming
you get a full eight hours the Aki amp
charger was quite impressive cutting
charging times in thirds with all three
phones yielding a roughly one hundred
and thirty minute recharge time it was
fairly consistent across the board to
say the least so just over two hours
this is thanks to the wall come quick
charge 2.0 and 3.0 integration and high
amp output the Motorola turbo charger
performed as expected with its intended
user the Moto X resulting in a mere 48
minute recharge time keep in mind this
is from 0 to 100% folks followed by the
s4 which is also quick charge capable
but not at the 12 volt output that the
ex Pyrrhus hence the 87 minutes so not
bad mind you of course we couldn't test
the iPhone with this charger but
expected to fall somewhere between the
expir and the s4 thanks to its smaller
battery a shocking result involve the
USB 2.0 header both the iPhone 5s and
galaxy s4 did charge albeit for lengthy
amounts of time but the Moto X pure for
reasons initially unknown refused to
charge the phone started up at 0% worked
its way to 3% over the course of an hour
and a half no I am not exaggerating
there and then proceeded to decline a
percentage once again back to 0 at which
point the phone died
restarted itself and then repeated the
cycle this was likely due to the
underlying processes taking place within
the Moto X while it was charging
basically the phone was consuming more
power while charging than it was
actually receiving power from the
charger that is unfortunate and actually
quite comical but what I want you to
take away from this video is the fact
that while cheap and generic charges
will get the job done it's the beefier
ones that pack the punch for quick
charging times look no further than the
amperage rating on the brick itself if
it's a USB 2.0 port that amperage is
fixed to half an amp if it's a turbo or
quick charger then you have to take into
consideration both the voltage and
amperage ratings
special thanks to Aki for hooking us up
with their five way amp charger as well
as their car charger which includes both
a USB type-c port and their quick
charger USB port you can plug up to five
devices into there
a charger with no loss in charge time
and with type-c gaining support on
phones like the Nexus 6p and 5x you
won't regret opting for the newer tech
I've attached links in this video
subscription to both of these products
be sure to check them out and let us
know what you think if you liked what
you saw in this video and you think the
experimentation was cool and unique give
this thing a thumbs up give it a thumbs
down I feel the complete opposite or
dated everything about life click
