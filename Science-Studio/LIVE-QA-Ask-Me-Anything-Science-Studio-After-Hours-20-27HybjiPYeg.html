Sunday night or Monday morning again
depending on where you live if ice not
obnoxious and very loud please let me
know I'm peaking in the yellow zone
which is the Green Zone for me these
from an audio perspective and things are
going well it's so good it's been a good
week it's been a long week I don't know
why the video is recently the channel
been been 10 15 even 20 minutes long and
and I usually try to condense like a you
know the the revenue differences between
like a 10 minute video and a 5 minute
video are pretty marginal I don't
stretch videos unless you know the video
itself beckons the extra information so
I can shave it down it's good because
viewer retention rates are usually
around 30% which means that
approximately 30% of the way into the
video the average person times out of
the video which means that either lost
your interest or you skipped around or
whatever so actually I think fewer than
half of you actually watched the entire
video all the way through and that's
true for most YouTube videos it isn't a
unique thing for us or anything but
that's why I try to shave the videos
down just because sometimes you know you
lose the viewer just because of all the
information throwing at the viewer or
because there's like dead time in
between you don't want to do that
because they're taking time out of their
day to watch your videos you got to keep
them keep them hooked you know you know
I don't want to lose the hook alright so
what's going on folks I have a chat pull
up right here the names that you're
seeing scrolling down below are the
patreon and YouTube supporters so if you
see the join button below this window
here on YouTube that join button is for
the YouTube used to be called YouTube
sponsors it's not that anymore they've
changed it to join it's like five bucks
a month I'm not asking for that it's not
a requirement by any means but this is
something I can kind of do special for
those people because I haven't been able
to really differentiate their
contributions from just the average
viewer so I can kind of give them a
public shout out here with that it's all
their names are scrolling here and
they'll be looping throughout the
livestream so I'll go through every week
I manually input these
I'll go there every week and make sure
that the names that are in there still
in this little scroll wheel thing and
then I'll add any additional names if we
have new patreon supporters or new
YouTube donors whatever so uh yeah
alright so we have a couple of questions
to kick things off obviously if you read
the title you know this is a QA you can
ask me whatever you want preferably
about tech I don't talk about a few
different topics that are very
controversial obviously but in the tech
space anything's fair game if I don't
know something I will do my best to
research the topic and address it either
in a future video which is great for
ideas because I'm always open to new
ideas for videos or in another live
stream or on Twitter or something
assuming you have a Twitter or Instagram
whatever usually it's a video or Q&amp;amp;A so
I see let's see Trojan gaming hey Greg
do you know any good desks under 70
bucks that can hold a dual 23 inch
monitor setup at a PC people recommend a
limb linman
but I would like to know if there are
any other good desks I have had an old
l-shaped desk that I used when I was
still in college that was pretty cheap I
don't know it was 70 bucks cheap but it
was I mean it was a cheaper desk you
know just like the particle board that
they like put some like coating on and
they kind of try to clean it up and
stuff but excuse me you know
architectural speaking it's pretty cheap
so that's when I would recommend I think
an l-shape desk in general is a good
type of desk to have because you can
differentiate all of your different you
know you can have like a separate
section of your desk just for work like
you know papers and stuff and then you
can have like another section of your
desk just for your PC and your monitors
and that set up there should be plenty
of space for dual monitors and a PC so
just something to watch out for okay
here scrolling down to let's see Joseph
Oh as science studio what I buy or
should I buy a crossfire 580 or a single
1070 TI I would do my best to avoid
crossfire SLI just because you might run
into that one situation like SLI is I
haven't used crossfire very much
personally I've done a few tests with
crossfire but I've never actually used a
crossfire config as a daily driver for a
while I've used SLI configs a lot I
can't
nine out of ten games are gonna be fine
with SLI or they're not gonna use SLI at
all but very few games I would say maybe
one out of ten are gonna have issues
like severe stutter issues with SLI so
if you happen to play that one game that
you know stutters and you're gonna be
very disappointed so I would do my best
to stay away from it
just because I mean you get a lot of
bang for your buck in the gtx 1070
territory even a single RX 580 is plenty
so if your gaming in up to 1440p and
you're okay with medium to high settings
a 580 can handle that 4k is a different
story gets really tough up there you're
gonna have to really drop some settings
it's doable especially some of the the
you know honestly weaker titles but how
does an artist graphically intensive but
I would step to 1440p even a 580 spine
so maybe just consider a single 580 over
a 1070 TI if you're in a saving some
money you can always buy a second 580
later on if you're really you know
wanting to upgrade let's see here we
have ex Satori exa Tori's how you saying
your name how long did you had have you
how long have you had your chair and has
it held up this thing's held up I have
two of these one is here and the other
one's right next to me on the other PC
and they've been holding a fine I like
vertigo I used vertigo chairs only and
they don't pay me to do that I haven't
got a dime from murder here but I like
their chairs I like this style chair I
know people are like whole heartedly
against racing chairs but this one fits
my like body you know I'm really skinny
so this one fits me perfectly excuse me
and it's it's got good lumbar support
believe it or not and at least for me
I'm not gonna be super picky about it I
just like the way that it wraps around
me and makes me feel like I'm sitting
snug in the chair we also have a trigger
or trigger whatever you want to call it
275 which is the more ergonomic style
chair from verdaguer and I use that in
the film room it's another great style
chair if you're into something that's a
bit more you know long-term comfortable
especially if you have back issues that
might be a chair you consider instead
but these terms of hella fine and I and
they're like I said there's nothing
holding me to hurt of here so like
because they're not paying me I can jump
ship whenever I want but I haven't had
any issues with these chairs and I've
had Pepsi you know a little cat she's
been jumping all over these things
clawing into them
and chairs holding up fine so I would
say they're they're actually made fairly
well let's see Papa Papa year guedes go
ahead get a Jetta I don't know how you
say your last name why did you ditch the
mate book if Final Cut Pro is better
because Final Cut Pro in my opinion is
not better I think that Adobe Premiere
Pro is leaps and bounds better from just
the ability to manipulate video it's the
UI I'm much more familiar with you know
once you get used to one interface it's
very difficult to change because all the
buttons and settings are in different
places like so warp stabiliser I know
exactly where that is in Premiere Pro
but I have no idea where to get to that
and Final Cut actually I do and I've
used Final Cut quite a bit but you know
having to switch back and forth is a
pain there are several functions in
Final Cut Pro I don't know how to do
that I can do in Premiere Pro color
grading and all myself and more
comfortable doing in Premiere Pro and
that's why I was looking for a small
portable laptop that was powerful enough
to run an OB Premiere Pro and get decent
render time Stephenson scrubbing on the
timeline and whatnot and the mate book X
Pro does that with especially with that
dedicated GPU the MX 150 and it's the
good MX 150 not that terrible one I was
playing pub G like 50 FPS in low
settings 1080p it's not bad for an
ultrabook I mean we're talking as thin
floor like the same size of the MacBook
13 inch but it handled it like a champ
I mean better than any other ultra book
I've ever tested so I'm not gonna
complain about it and I was you know I
was happy with the MacBook but I'm even
more happy that I can use final cut or
premiere pro again with an ultraportable
okay let's see here smooth es are you
waiting for a game this year interesting
question I don't not really I'm very
picky about the games that I play it
takes a lot for me to like invest
heavily in a game the last game to do
that was pub key for me and I still
played even though it frustrates the
heck out of me sometimes I played a lot
just because it's a good pastime with
friends I play that with Lisa I play it
with my brothers I play it with will in
it's it's just a you know it's it's a
cool dynamic game in a sense you're
forced to kind of communicate and work
together before that was gta5 I played
that for like four years both on console
and on PC and then before that was like
so a few Call of Duty titles but like
very specific games City skylines I
really like it's really I'm really a
handful of them so I'm particularly no
nothing that stands out but I would I
will be sure to let you know if I start
binging on something because I'm sure
you'll see it in discord I'll be playing
it all the time let's see mr. mr. plow
to need a GPU now by a 10:15 upgrade
later or just wait for 1070 10-6 1170
eleven sixty well if you need a GPU now
I think that answers your question I
don't know how bad that you need it now
but if you need it now badly enough then
maybe you should buy ten fifty now and
then sell it later get an eleven seventy
or whatever so there you go Gio a JDM
asks if a 970 evo is good sure I use
plenty of IVs plenty of people drive
from Samsung and they're great I think
if you can find them you know like if
you can get like a 500 gig for around a
hundred two hundred and twenty bucks
you're sitting gold and that's hard to
come by especially with the newer drives
usually can find 950 Evo's even for
around 100 bucks now for about half a
terabyte so that's really good from an
SSD perspective because they're leaps
and bounds faster than it and a hard
drive so something else to keep keep in
mind okay let's see here Jeremy art says
oh come on Greg that's a lie is everyone
is waiting for cyberpunk 2077 it
what would you hate me if I told you I
had no idea what that was like I don't
even know if that's a real game but if
it is I have never heard it before I
just realized that my little thing oh no
it's working let's see I'm gonna fix the
crash bandicoot thing scrolling up a
little bit there we go
it looks like text on the bottom is
getting cut out but I don't know it
might be okay here we go
scrolling down just a little bit more
tap see lone says hello from the
Philippines anakin bounty 97 I can't
hear you please raise your mic my mic is
like maxed out dude so problems on your
end
no one else as far as I know is
complaining about the sounds so you
might want to check your device
let's see trigger bomb shoot on the
super chat Thank You truck a bomb
trucker bomb is a long time support of
the channel both via YouTube he is a
he's been a donor for a while and he
always shows up at the live stream so I
appreciate you and for your
contributions in discord you're very
active there as well
tried AMD story my yet can we get a
video on it I'm sorry I know you guys
asked that last week I'm still working
on it I wanted to have it up this
weekend but it's just the dewetting
video took like three days to put
together and then the painting video
took longer than I thought to so I'm
gonna have to move that back to next
week but I want to have it out by next
week because AMD is actually pressing me
on that too because they sent me a bunch
of stuff for it I haven't actually put
the video together yet so yeah I'll get
to it very soon
turjun gaming asked hey Greg when will
you do pub key streams again very soon I
want to do it with Lisa like I feel like
if I stream by myself I'm just gonna
rage at players and and like you're just
gonna hear me getting angry all the time
I don't really do that great by myself I
do really well in a duo I don't do very
well in squads I feel like there are too
many people to worry about with squads
but with duo's as long as you're synched
up with that one other person which is
why I like playing with Lisa cuz we're
right next to each other and we know
each other really well we can
communicate like hey you got the kind of
left I got to gone there right okay
shoot now boom you know and it's like
problem solved
but with four people like you can't
really get all that stuff vibing very
well and and that's kind of why I shy
away from it okay bazinga $50.00
superjet bazinga 24 I'm gonna screenshot
this just for her she'll really
appreciate that visiting guy
I appreciate you YouTube support as well
your name should be scrolling down here
you'll see it at some point and then
those of you by the way who are both
YouTube and patreon supporters will have
their name scrolling at double time so
you'll see your name twice down there I
don't really know like I know Smitty
whit's
you see Smitty whit's right there Smitty
whit's is both a YouTube and patreon
supporter so you'll see his name twice
so you know it's really hard for me to
give you like double double with stuff
double the benefits if you're gonna like
fine you know monetarily support us
but that's the best I can do at this
point I apologize let's see I'm gonna
scroll down thanks again though bazinga
ifit's that's a lot of money my dude I
appreciate it annalisa and Pepsi will
hear that Pepsi somebody gave you $24
I've been trying all this different cat
food this cat is picky I have a serious
headache like on the top of my head
she's super picky like I bought her
three different kinds of cat food now
and she's like I don't know if she just
wants a certain kind of cat food on any
particular day and she wants me to like
cycle through all three flavors whatever
she did it worked because I have like
four bags of different cat food on top
of the fridge and I don't know which one
she wants at any given time so just kind
of mix them up okay scrolling down here
but let's see let's see
Nick H science 2d I'm thinking of deal
eating my CPU should I go for a direct
die mount or a copper IHS replacement
copper IHS interesting
I don't know about the cost of actually
either one when I was using devours kid
I didn't bother to even look up the
price I think if you're gonna deal it
and like direct eye mount you're
probably you've probably got a pretty
big budget anyway it's more of an
enthusiast thing so with that in mind I
would say if direct eye mounting is it's
possible with your chip I think that's a
better option people say that it's
unsafe as like a dur Bowers kit was
perfectly fine you know I didn't have
any issues with with my direct I'm
outing kit the issue again though like
the reason why you have the IHS they're
not just to transfer the heat but also
to prevent that die from being crushed
by all that pressure that you apply to
the board with you know and to the
socket with your cooler you know if you
think about it you're really torquing
those coolers onto those sockets you
know there's a really hard press between
the CP or the IHS in particular and the
cooler so when your direct eye mounting
you want to be careful not to over
torque because you could actually split
that die and it's happened more than
once I've seen it happen before so you
got to be careful with that but that's
really the only risk involved I think
you'll get better results with the
direct die mounting but if the price is
there's a huge disparity in price than
just using a copper IHS
fine I'm sure just stick with something
that's better than MX for something like
cryo not conduct a not icy diamond if
you want to get weird with it but I
would just stick with liquid metal if
possible okay scrolling down here Oh
Anakin bounty said I raised my volume so
it's good now there you go see okay
scrolling down here scrolling down okay
lateral G asks if I was to pair the
thermal take aluminum radiator with the
EK aluminum products would I be fine
in theory yes now I don't know how
different the manufacturing processes
and the QC standards are for both
companies
you know EK aluminum rads might be more
pure than thermal take thermaltake might
have several impurities in the cooler or
in the radiator that you have to clean
out make sure that you flush everything
before you combine these components and
I would stick with look the radiators
gonna have the most surface area right
so I would stick with the liquid or the
the coolant that's included in the kit
with the radiator that you're using
because that's where most of the fluids
gonna spend its time as in that radiator
if you stick with that I mean I can't
guarantee you anything but in theory yes
you should be fine doing that because
aluminum is aluminum right I mean there
are different grades of aluminum but
it's it's just a metal oh you know with
the impurities and stuff you got
different variances there I'd say I mean
I would do it I would give it a shot
worst case you find out that you can it
starts gunking up you notice that
there's residue and build up and inside
different blocks and stuff and you have
to clean it out but I don't think it'd
be catastrophic just pay attention to it
over time
okay scroll in down here Jamie Williams
what's the cheapest best GP ever bought
I snagged a 980 a few months back for a
hundred bucks or roughly 130 us not bad
that's a really good fine 980 is
equivalent to about in ten sixty yes
it's in ten sixty territory but at 1066
gig costs what three hundred bucks maybe
a little under that but a 980 and
granted it's it's gonna draw a bit more
power a 980 is going to be much cheaper
in the used market so that's a really
good fine there I think the best that I
ever found
I bought a 980 TI
or to 230 something like that 980ti is
about 1070 so I literally paid almost
half price at the time for a night for a
90 DTI that 10 70s were going for which
is a comparable card from a performance
perspective you know I know that Nvidia
drivers now kind of degrade the older
stuff but still it's in that realm so
that was probably the best one that I
did I had it was a Miranda was oh gosh I
want to say it was an EVGA 980ti because
I had an idea before that I was an msi
in my sight it was a Gold Edition or
whatever it was a whole orange shroud
980ti but yeah that was something I was
interested in because I didn't want to
pay full price for a 1070 and they were
hard to find
now bazinga extra dollars to try to get
my nude how about about how about a
step-by-step FreeNAS setup video well
yeah that would be great if I actually
had one I haven't actually built any
network attack network attached storage
device PC whatever you want to call it I
don't have one because I really don't
need one although wills been trying to
get me one for a long time my FreeNAS
would be cool though I just need to get
the parts and actually do it I'm a
little too cheap to go out and buy 10 5
terabyte hard drives so that's kind of
the downside there yeah I know
ok let's see here what do we have Oh
Anakin wants a yes please do freenas
setup please okay we've got more demand
for that maybe Linford kingston do you
think 1440p is better at 144 Hertz I
certainly think so I would trade
resolution for a high refresh rate any
day of the week I really think that a
higher refresh rate is beneficial not
only for a gamer but also I mean just
daily use might see like Windows just
scroll across the screen that like this
screen here's 240 Hertz and 240 to 144
is a little harder for me to discern but
going from 60 Hertz or even 100 Hertz to
141
165 is a huge difference there and I
would I would stay on 1080p if that
meant that I could get a higher refresh
rate I would trade 1440p for 144 it's
any day of the week
scrolling down here every time I scroll
like skips over and then I lose all your
questions what is going on here alright
okay pop up above from the bays they're
really noticeable difference between a 1
millisecond and a 4 millisecond monitor
in terms of response time interesting
question um in most cases no I've used
one millisecond monitors I've used I
have plenty of 5 millisecond monitors I
can't tell much of a difference you'll
see ghosting and a few like it just very
rare circumstances I'm sure that there
are more trained guys out there than I
that I have that can tell you exactly
what response time is what on each
monitor but in my personal experience I
haven't noticed enough of a difference
to want me to ditch 5 milliseconds for 1
millisecond so you can keep you know
keep that back your head that's just
something I'll tell you I don't have
like you know ultra high-speed cameras
to show you this stuff there is a
difference but if it's noticeable enough
to the layman I would say no in most
cases it's usually just a marketing
tactic to get people to think that their
monitors are better for gaming when in
reality I mean any high refresh rate
monitor is gonna usually have a decent
response time anyway ok BlueScope 819
recently bought a 780 for 140 and I'm
considering painting it is there
anything I should know before I go ahead
blue scope if you saw my painting video
that's really all I mean that I I have
those videos out there for a reason so
anything I have to tell you about the
painting process that's the video that I
would tell you to watch that way I don't
have to keep like explaining
individually to people that watch the
video I talked about it the risks and
stuff and what I do when I dissect
components and how I paint and you
should have a clean result make sure you
use the right paint though
JDM wat pop yellow super Chad hey sign
studio a longtime fan well you check out
my website server builds dotnet on
stream would love to collab I will have
to check it out
then I will get back to you I tell you
what I'm gonna put it in my browser
right now so I don't forget about it
server bills are dying there and if you
are not in the discord already $145 Nast
killer vision vision to you the
Terminator yeah join on join this chord
if you haven't already and then paying
me just at me in there I'll see your
notification and then we'll go from
there Monday thank you for that $5 super
chat tap see lon I'm choosing between
deep cool castle 240 or two
88-millimeter scuse me and a courser HH
115 i non-pro 280 which one would you
recommend I haven't used the coarser H
115 I've used the deep cool Castle
though from an aesthetic standpoint
that's really where I would make my
decision I think you're probably gonna
have a stronger pump in the H 115 I so
if you if you care more about
performance the marginal performance tip
I mean really pump speed is kind of at a
certain point you kind of reach this
like area where there aren't any changes
between pump rpm and actual cooling
performance right because if you have a
slower pump then the fluids going to
take longer to cycle through your system
but it's also going to take longer to
move through your radiator so it'll lose
more energy in the radiator but if you
have a faster pump then you're pulling
heat quicker away from other sources at
the same time though your fluids
probably not going to cool as quickly
there's kind of a trade and blow there
but in general both are fine I'm sure I
know the 159 is great I haven't actually
personally tested it but I can say
without a doubt that the castle 280 is
also a great cooler the to 80
millimeters is a better one that I have
is I have a 240 so yeah I think both of
those are fine okay scrolling down here
buh-buh-buh-buh okay Ren are two in
darfur t 74 I think it's supposed to
render 74 y'all names o at science to do
what's the most you've ever paid for a
processor I paid a thousand bucks for a
processor house the most I ever paid for
one I did that twice
That's not me bragging that's me telling
you it was really stupid idea because if
CPUs weren't worth the price tag not for
what I do so yeah okay scroll them down
some more here let's see Brian Zhang
when is the M 360 bill happening Brian
it's already on the channel so you
probably missed it but I built a PC I
showed it while I showed what it all
looked like in that video it was
something about me building like a new
custom loop I think I built a rising 7
PC with it but you should watch the
video it's like four or five videos back
anyway let's see James Fondren he wants
me to talk about music for a minute by
the way it's one G not to geez
my name is Greg not Greg good good I'm
just riffing on people with that
spelling anyway talk about music for a
minute okay my favorite band
I have two favorite bands one of them is
Breaking Benjamin I saw I've seen them
three times in concert now my second
favorite band my other favourite band is
is Bring Me The Horizon
I like their new stuff I think as far
back as probably some paternal or there
is a hell I probably would I would be on
the fence about both of those but after
that right I think SEP paternal was
really good I like that's the spirit a
lot
I like how they changed their their vibe
a little bit so yeah in that realm of
possibility after that maybe it starts
going down the line I really like hinder
I like my darkest days three days grace
a lot of old school stuff scorpions Def
Leppard Judas Priest Iron Maiden all the
good stuff that define what we hear now
on the radio okay scrolling down here
let's see
Alex David what are your thoughts on the
note 9 doesn't look like anything
special to me just off the top i've
watched a few of the preliminary reviews
they weren't in-depth reviews because
i'm pretty sure they're bound by an NDA
but nothing about that iphone really
surprises me and i don't think it's
worth the price to be honest
okay let's see Dudley five dollar super
chapped my cat schrott it Schroedinger
how you say that says this says this is
to buy your kitty some catnip oh okay
Pepsi you're gonna have spoiling her you
can't do that she's sleeping on the
chair right here she did originally
respond to me she's not doing that now
but anyway she is definitely an
interesting character and I have some
catnip actually in a little bag and
every time I pour some I'll just pour
like she has a big cat tree that bought
her and every time I want to just
distract her let her you know stop
biting cables when I'm building a PC
I'll take some of her catnip I'll pour
it all over her cat tree and she just
goes nuts like so she will appreciate
that I will be sure to buy her some more
catnip and I will thank Dudley and I'm
sure Pepsi will too once she wakes up
she she's gonna be up all night and
every time she sleeps at like 8 or 9
p.m. she wakes up at like 1:00 in the
morning and then she goes insane like
crazy for four hours while I'm trying to
sleep it show sprint into the room jump
up on the bed with me and then turn
around and sprint back out knock her
head on the door and and run into
everything else you know cats have the
tapetum lucidum x' and their eyes they
can see in the dark they have those
little mirrors or reflectors I don't
think she I mean I see him in her eyes
but I don't think she actually uses them
because she runs into stuff all the time
I don't know if that's just heard not
knowing what's what or maybe she's a
little short tech yes city mama Brian is
into chat I totally you know you could
have been in the livestream today I
didn't even ask you about that we were
talking earlier today about YouTube and
other things and I should ask you about
the livestream I had posted that like a
right one you when we were talking - I
didn't think about it Brian
if you take me up on my offer you can be
in the next live stream with me I will
do you the honor but yeah and if you
want me hanging out back in your live
stream let me know my dude Brian and I
are on the same we're on the same
wavelength
Brian's Brian's good people and that's
why we have the joint discord so tech
yes or science yes City is there our tag
team discord where everybody from both
channels can come in itself totally free
you can come in there and hang out with
us and talk Tech and whatever else you
feel like talking about let's see mr. KF
gave me what's going on mr. KF gaming
looking good with that yellow battery
there do you feel like the lumbar pillow
on the SLE mm feels like it's trying to
force you out of your chair maybe I'm
using mine wrong or maybe it's the wrong
okay so it's a good question I have
mixed feelings about that I do like the
way that it bolsters me and I think the
only reason why it doesn't feel like
it's forcing me out of the chair is
because the side like the I don't know
what you call these the the bolster seat
bolsters I'm trying to think it like the
day decides where the kind of sticks out
a little bit underneath your arms I'm
pretty sure that's what it's called it's
not you guys know what I'm talking about
these are the things always get worn out
in cars that you can probably these
things here yeah that's what I'm talking
about
so these fit around my back perfectly
and I think that's why I don't feel like
I'm being ejected from my chair good I
know that feeling
just because of the chair itself is like
so slim I think it fits me perfect and
that's why I'm happy with it well let's
see here misfits Josh asks where's
McLovin McLovin is work and doing his
own meemic Levin's got a job he said he
works at a hospital and and he's a he'd
been busy
he'd been going on let's see here Spyros
visuals best way to pack and ship a
high-end PC you don't ask me because I
sent one via UPS and it got destroyed
I'd say the best way to do it ship it
via crate Friday you know like just pack
it in a especially if it's a really
expensive PC you could probably get away
with a cheaper lighter bill just
shipping it in the box that it comes in
maybe with some extra padding around the
sides and I know other companies do that
like you know in CX ease buildi service
ships pcs in that fashion and they come
out alright for the most part so I would
say that it really comes down to how
comfortable you are with the build and
how expensive and heavy the build is if
it's a custom loop build I would only
ship those fright just because you're
I've had too many bad experiences with
shipping companies to ever trust them
and though
ever again tree here dark pie 101 will
be covering thread Rupa - that question
was asked earlier I will eventually win
until send or when AMD sends me
something I didn't get anything
initially from AMD so we'll be waiting
for that for now though I recommend you
check out my boy Brian over at techie a
city because he's got that twenty nine
ninety W X benchmark and all them cores
up in that ship all right let's see
scrolling down here
Joey two two six eight eight what do you
think about the case labs bankruptcy I
mean I never used case labs case I
thought they made very unique cases I
thought they were a little pricey but
they were well built obviously you're
paying for quality I don't know any of
the guys personally over there I've
never talked to any of them but I know a
lot of other tech tubers did have good
relationships with that company so yeah
it sucks I mean it sucks to see anybody
go under I I don't know enough about
their finances to tell you what exactly
went wrong when it went wrong I know
they they kind of pinned it on the
tariffs and stuff but I have a feeling
things were much deeper than that that's
just the impression I got when I was
reading the message so I mean you know
like if you have really good years you
know and really good quarters and
whatnot and then all of a sudden a
tariff jacks up your import fees or
whatever then usually you can mitigate
that in the long run if you have decent
finances to back up the interim period
but if they weren't doing great to begin
with you know if they had very slim
margins and all of a sudden the
terrorists bump the price of steel under
the components of the use in those cases
up above that threshold then they can't
be profitable anymore
but forcing them you know being forced
into bankruptcy and liquidating assets
is a that's like that's pretty hardcore
you know like that that just means they
don't have enough money you know to pay
off anything that's that's really the
only time he liquidate assets when you
you know when you're you're struggling
so I wish them all the best I don't know
any of them personally again if any of
them you know are watching this dream or
will watch this stream I hope you guys
keep trucking along you know it's it's
not something that any of us can really
fix it's just something that they've got
to figure out for themselves and I'm
sure they will they built case labs up
to what they did I'm sure they could do
it again it sucks
it sucks that that happen but they'll
figure it out
let's see scrolling down to something
else good Jason is asking when your next
Craigslist ad reading is on the way I'm
actually gonna change it up a little bit
now I'm not ditching craigslist ads
because those are still gonna be around
but I'm gonna try something just a
little different in the next I read
video just because I you know I've been
milking the Craigslist in the Facebook
videos for a while I think I'm gonna
start another little miniseries in that
playlist and kind of intertwine that
with craigslist ads just to get your
feedbacks I don't want to keep sticking
with the same thing I feel like people
are just gonna be posting craigslist ads
that are ridiculous just to get my
attention I've seen if you had to have
already done that very clearly they're
just trolls so kind of branching off and
doing multiple things will allow that
market to kind of settle down a little
bit and then then we'll be good to go
thanks tech crimson by the way watch you
see our moderator their tech crimson is
linking the discord it's a public
discord you can join it for free just
download this cord you can join it and
talk to it myself talk to Brian talk to
will anyone else in there about whatever
you feel is on your mind let's see
trucker bomb asks are you as mad about
AMD snubbing you off the new TR to stuff
as I am I mean it's not to be fair it's
not AMD who's like not sending us stuff
I mean I rights you know I'm not gonna
pitch a fit about not getting something
that I feel like I should yet I mean I'm
not even you know look at JJ ting get
one I there in Jays three times four
times our size so I I don't think that
it's my place to get mad at AMD you know
I don't I'm not entitled to anything I
shouldn't act that way but at the same
time it you know it's like I said it's
not ambe's doing it it's a distribution
company a marketing company working on
behalf of an be called Edelman who they
suck to work with Edelman's they're just
terrible
they take forever to reply to emails you
can tell they're just stretched too thin
or they don't know how to organize or
manage and I'll tell them out to their
faces like they're they're just annoying
to work with and there's nothing worse
in a company relationship than having to
deal with people who can never respond
on time I try my best to respond almost
instantly like whenever I get an email
from somebody if specially on my
phone like I try right away to answer as
quickly as possible because I expect the
same from them I want them to respond to
me as quickly as I respond to them
sometimes I go weeks without responding
and I feel terrible but then I try not
to do that again I try to make up for it
by being as immediate as possible so you
know it's it kind of just comes down to
how professional you want to be how on
the game you want to be I don't really
care for Edelman I never have I think
it's poor choice on AMD's part to work
with a company like that not be no this
says really nothing to do with tr2 at
this point like I just I've had issues
getting them to do anything and it just
comes down to who they feel is is you
know gonna review him properly you know
we didn't get TR once or if we didn't
get the Red River one samples either you
know so it's not it's not something I
was that surprised me it really didn't
it surprised me more than J didn't get
one I thought was really strange that J
didn't get one it just shows you how
clueless they are okay
scrolling down but let's see Erik fain
fain stock good gosh I probably
butchered that last name do you think
AMD will surpass Intel and single core
performance if it happens it'll happen
soon I think it'll happen first actually
probably within the next two years
I think AMD is gonna pass and tell if
Intel keeps just taking forever with
this 10 nanometer stuff you know ambi
already on 7 is pretty that's a huge
jump I mean we've had 7 to be frankly
we've had 7 nanometre stuff in chips
right but we haven't actually had an
amine stream consumer grade processors
yet that's why I think Amy's gonna
really bring it home with this next line
up depending on how well it does I know
I'm watching AMD stock queue because I
want to start playing the market here
soon and AMD stocks looking really juicy
right now so we'll see alright Josh asks
at science studio what is an acceptable
markup on a build with all new hardware
on Craigslist I've talked about this in
a few different live streams Josh I
would say no more than 10% and make it a
flat percentage 10% if it's a cheap
build 10% of 50 500 bucks is 50 bucks
but if it's a $5,000 build 10% of 5,000
is $500 gonna take a lot
to build a more elaborate pcs to me
that's a fair thing I wouldn't go more
than ten percent though if you want to
do a full-time its I still probably
wouldn't go about ten percent a bazinga
X $10 super chat again dude you were you
were just throwing money at us dude I
appreciate it keeps K slabs issues
started with the time to ship three
months on average by Eddie cancel my
last order their issue is lack of
production capability Wow
three months to ship I had no idea
that's insane that's like I was looking
for an exhaust a full I was looking for
a full exhaust kit for my car and they
have a few different companies to choose
from that's a it's a newer car so there
aren't as many you know aftermarket
companies out there that are reputable
in the space so you kind of have to just
go with what's available if you want
something now right and I was looking at
an exhaust kit that was I think it was
from fast intentions I want to say his
name of the company and their exhaust
gets where I mean they were comfortable
in price like 1500 bucks or so for a
full catback and they wanted like eight
to ten weeks or something like that it
was in the wrong with like two months to
to ship this stuff to me and then their
excuses that they're all handmade
components right so they big hand weld
all the steel and stuff and I'm like in
my eyes like I you know I get that you
don't want to sit on inventory I get
that but it doesn't hurt to have ten
kits laying around you know like why do
you have to literally make them to order
every time to me that's just a failed
business practice and people don't and
I've seen on forums people don't buy
their products just because they don't
want to wait you know when you pay a lot
of money for something you want it now
people are impatient and and rightfully
so doing extent because they're taking
your money right away but you're not you
know getting the product right away so
so yeah and that's my take on it let's
yeah yellow Pablo Salazar he says hi
Greg Salazar Salazar Congrats haha cool
last name in it the 79 80 X 80 you
tested before what was your best
overclock and B core the highest I could
get on that thing with the cooler I mean
I'm limited not by the overclock but by
the cooler so that deep cooled 360 ml a
I Oh
couldn't couldn't even hold 4.2
gigahertz and that's not very high
people have gotten 5 gigahertz before so
that chip isn't a very what decently bin
chip but on top of that it is not
something that that was limiting from a
vcore perspective or the cpu was in
super tolerant it's just it's also the
the cooler is not big enough is enough
beefy enough to handle the overclock so
because if the chips just run so hot
which is another reason why I don't
recommend X to 99 but yeah anyway ok I
saw an all caps question here what was
this let me see this scroll and here
matlock ization asking why does Greg
shield for Intel Nvidia he says that
while I'm using an AMD r7 2700 to stream
this live stream so joke's on you
Matlock ization ha scrolling down here
let's see here
brian says be right back got a hawk PC
AMD will give you a sample in time just
work with Intel and AMD or an Nvidia to
see who their products are Forks that
are just just avoid the circle-jerk
negativity stuff that's why I love Brian
you just call this straight up
ok scrolling down here
see down post-apocalyptic Peter S is
pimping easy I wouldn't know oh jeez
let's see Jason as invaders as they see
me scrolls and they hatin elias's ladies
and gentlemen we got him and I'm sure I
folks mmm ok here
I think he's trolling if he keeps
trolling I'm just gonna block them I
don't know why he's doing that what's
going on trucker bomb I see you again
dude every time I see that yellow
battery it just looks better and better
I love that but it's you know what's
even looked better than that
a green battery you gonna get a green
battery next month actually he's coming
up pretty soon so you'll be the first
you and mr. KF gaming will be the first
two green batteries on the channel just
so you know in zou Chi were you a
science major in college I was an
engineering
you should watch my videos on
engineering stuff because I talk about
what I did there if you want more
insight into what I was doing so you can
stop all cap Singh the question what are
your thoughts on the upcoming GPU
announcements launches I really don't I
don't really follow the rumors in crap I
looked a little bit the 1080 you're
supposed to 1080p see me but and we did
confirm like that the GTD r6 there was a
180 I think it was a 180 pin PGA so I
mean oh it's GTD r6 so it's got to be a
next-gen card but what card specifically
it is we don't know what anybody is
gonna call it we don't know but and
there was like our TX like there's all
these different like weird names people
are finding and stuff but in general I
don't look at that stuff in depth until
we actually see the product launch and
then I do a lot of digging I look at all
the specs I look at I crossed you know I
do a lot of cross analyses with all the
different cards they have coming out
compare that to the old stuff talk about
how the architecture itself is different
make predictions based on that but yeah
lieutenant goldenrod you get a green
battery next time so like you should get
it soon like in the next 10 or 20 days
because it's per month so after your
third month supporting us on YouTube you
get a green battery or fourth mind well
on your fourth month you get a green
battery I should say because you get a
red battery right away so oh yeah let's
see ninja sauce as what's your next
phone gonna be I really don't know I've
been using the V 30 for a while it's a
really good phone and I'm really happy
with it
I really like the V the only thing that
sucks about the V 30 is it doesn't have
the stereo speaker I think by this point
stereo speakers you kind of gotta have
that I it's really tough going from a
stereo speaker phone like the iPhone 7
which was stereos people with the semi
stereo speaker and the the earpiece
speaker was a little trembling but still
speaker you know quality from both sides
and then going from that to the LG TV 30
was kind of tough so speakers and then
the cameras aren't that great the ultra
white is the best thing about the LGB 30
but the actual camera itself is not good
compared to some of the competitors the
pixel to excel and the iPhone 10 are
really good competitors okay let's see
mid-age think that $6.99 Canadian
shorted me one penny what
and they're looking for a seven even
just kidding then I have a 1700 X I want
to purchase an x 370 RG cross her Wi-Fi
or X 470 gaming 7 also best possible 16
gig memory get to reach at least 30 20
be ok 1700 X is really tough to get I
mean really tough but it's a lot more
difficult to get thirty-two hundred
megahertz with RAM on a 1700 X and then
a 2700 X the second generation stuff is
a big leap forward for an in that
apartment I mean I can enable xme X and
P profile any kid that I have laying
around even stuff that was out before
AMD released first gen risin and it'll
still run like clockwork but a 1700 X is
gonna be a lot more stubborn you've got
a good motherboard there the crosshair
and the X 470 gaming 7 those are both
good boards if you go with the X I mean
really either one you could hit those
frequencies you're gonna be limited more
or less by the memory kit itself so look
for kids that have specifically rise in
compatibility those are the chips are
gonna be been to benefit rise in
architecture you're gonna get the higher
frequencies with that you might not get
30 200 megahertz you might have spent a
lot of money to get that frequency but
it will benefit you because I am DS
infinity fabric is tied to memory
frequencies and timings so yeah I think
you're on the right track you just got
to find the right kit and you'll just
have to look for the ones that are
actually labeled Adam Stephenson asked
Greg did you watch Starship Troopers to
not watch stars I know the second one is
like super cheesy I mean the first one
was cheesy too I really liked the first
one though I mean it was cheesy but in a
good way
what's that guy's name Casper not Casper
Van Van Dyne or Van Dien I don't
remember his name but yeah he was he's a
cool guy
he's I mean I think he fit the part in
the movie and you know anyway he was
kind of weird and funny and creepy when
I was younger I watched it a lot so it
was always more scary to me but now that
I'm older I realized it like the bugs
and all that crap just kind of silly but
anyway
let's see contra Greg what do you
thoughts on a 2700 X and 1080 TI for
streaming games at 1080p but just plenty
it looks really good it's a good setup
there and it's very well balanced let's
see I've got a 120 rad but no screws to
mount the fan any ideas on screw size
the threading and radiators is different
than the threading and fans themselves
so if you you know the fan screws are a
bit the threading is wider and usually
taller so the gap between each thread is
is bigger but when you're screwing the
screws into a radiator the threading
gonna be a lot slimmer I'm trying to
think you could use the screws that you
used to mount your motherboard assuming
they're em oh gosh I remember their m6
or m3 screws but you could use most of
the most of the time you could use the
screws that used to mount your
motherboard to mount your radiator to
your case if you need fin if you need
longer screws to mount your fan to your
radiator from the other side that's
gonna be a little more difficult you're
going to actually buy that stuff
separately so I won't comment on
motherboard kit okay let's see post cool
oh yeah post apocalyptic peter says he's
on the b-24 the went good phone - Lance
West are you ting ninety nine hundred K
sample from Intel I don't know probably
not until doesn't send me Jack anyway
let's see scrolling down oh here Peter
asked some MOA at science studio getting
at a PC gaming found an omen 15 DC oo
5-1 in our review say it has a CPU heat
issues should I look for another PC or
attempt to undervolt also what happens
or also what laptops would you suggest
for 1250 it depends on what kind of
laptop you're going for form factor wise
1250 is a pretty good price point you
could buy some gaming laptops that are
like 800 bucks I don't have like you
know full on desktop grade 10 60s in
them but if you want like a sleeker
Ultrabook style laptop Asus has some
decent Ultrabook style laptops in that
price range and you also get discreet
graphics in some of those the MX 150 or
MX 130 so I would slip for those kinds
of laptops you want to spend a bit more
in the mate book ex-pro the one with the
MX 150 is a really great laptop I use
that as my daily laptop and that's kind
of right to keep it if you want bigger
than that there are so many 15.6 inch
laptops out there I just don't like that
form factor so just good the one that
has the best specs for the best reviews
for the best price
let's see scrolling down to Matthew
Beebe what's your opinion rise in 520
600 I expressed my opinion explicitly in
my risin 5 2600 review you should
probably watch that video I'm not gonna
spoil it you gotta go watch it that's
why it's up there
let's see Mick Nico Michael I think it
says their name anyway if my motherboard
only supports one 500 GB header how many
are jeebies headers at maximum can RGB
splitters handle interesting I don't
really know but I know that if you keep
splitting voltage right you're just
gonna have less voltage coming through
the entire thing so your RGB x' will be
dimming over time if you keep applying
more power to them I actually don't know
how that scales but I know if you have
like a single you know battery you hook
up a strip of LEDs and then you add
another strip after that and another
strip after that right so you have less
current that can flow through each strip
individually that's why they're dimmer
but I don't really know the answer to
that question I really don't I wish I
did let's see if I can find anything on
that online let's see yeah let's see
here we have beta so you saying I'm
bitter I'm gonna say bita would you
recommend a gaming laptop with a Rison
chip and an AMD GPU sure I mean it I
mean excuse me
gaming laptops in general I don't like
too much because they're just usually
they're bulky and if they're not bulky
they make compromises elsewhere they're
super loud battery life is trash I mean
there are some legitimate like super
powerful gaming laptops that only last
45 minutes when playing a video game on
a full charge to me that's terrible but
that's exactly what happens with those
beefier laptops because you can't have
anything higher than 100 mega watt
megawatt-hour milli
you guys won't talk about honey 100 watt
battery can have anything bigger than
that and the reason why you can is
because you can't take those things on
planes so that would basically ground
your whole system can never take that
anywhere the whole point of a laptop is
for it to be portable so you can take it
anywhere so they're limited by federal
regulations and stuff obviously the
better it should be a lot bigger that
government would allow and it would be
you know easy to take those on planes so
yeah I know yeah live chat latency yeah
I'm gonna blame YouTube I could drop the
latency significantly but it would it
would increase significantly the the
amount of pool on my internet so maybe
I'll try and just see how late and it is
if I just like completely like make it
and there's a setting in there when I
set up the livestream that makes it like
literally not late at all but I don't
know if I'm gonna have severe lags doing
that so we'll say anyway Albert Croesus
thank you Greg I don't know what you're
thinking about but your well let's see
Jeremy our Greg go for the galaxy s 9
it's better than the V 30 screen is
superior best on the market no doubt how
has a screen superior because I know
that like this is Super AMOLED I mean
it's the same technology I know they're
probably several differences in color
gamma and stuff like that but I think
that like the differences between
screens at this point as long as they're
all Super AMOLED in 1440p Plus pretty
marginal like I I'm not too picky about
the screen and I really like the battery
life on this thing better life is really
incredible I also hate TouchWiz I don't
like Bixby and only getting that crap I
like to stock Android experience and you
can't even root like because you trip
NOx every time you try to do that with a
Samsung phone can't even route the dang
thing so not that this is rooted I plan
to route it eventually okay it's
scrolling down here you're scrolling
down I see the questions uh every time I
do this it like skips across all these
good questions okay amnesia scrubbed 12
that's science studio do you think a
ten-month-old ZOTAC gtx 1066 key camp
edition for 188 is good yeah it's a good
price anything under 200 bucks for 1060
is a really good price so under warranty
- I would describe it physical quality
is a - yeah I mean if it's like if there
are noticeable chips on the board or
like chips in the shroud and stuff and
like one fan dead I wouldn't do that
because there's gonna be
replace those parts but 188 for a car
that functions and looks good is a
really good price especially for a 1062
a6 king card and so tech amp is that's a
good brand let's see here honey badger
says $14.99 for an I 77 okay and she
checks 10:17 ooh good deal it's an okay
deal I think it's anything exceptional I
could build something comparable you
know I mean you can with most pre-built
I don't think you're gonna make much of
a discount because they have to have you
know they have markups right but they
buy in bulk so usually they get all
these components for a lot cheaper than
we do because instead of buying one
graphics card they'll buy twenty right
and they'll get a discount for buying 20
instead of one but the margins
themselves usually don't trickle down to
the consumer so you could usually build
a prebuilt yourself for around that
price at this you know the same specs
it's just to save people time having to
build them so high almost under almost
all circumstances with pre-built
especially right now I would recommend
building your own because you can pick
the parts you want and you can ensure
that the power is flying everything else
in there is a good power supply and good
whatever else you're concerned about my
voice is just shot right now
Oh what's up Weston bear hi Greg glad I
could catch the stream would you
recommend the losted tech MX master 2's
for productivity loss to tech you mean
launch attack I never lost a tech oh
yeah let's see here it looks pretty cool
I've never been into like those huge
swooping wings on Mouse's though mice I
should say I mean yeah it's really
Mouse's or VIP mice are very very
subjective
I don't like claw grip mice I don't like
mice with like very elaborate things
stemming from them I like very simple
mice just because that's what I've used
growing up okay scroll down yeah but but
but scrolling down okay um you got a
good stuff
okay Oh Joseph can Oh what's going on
Joseph I see you when do you think the
10:50 TI will become obsolete I don't
know when I should upgrade from that
card for 1080p gaming on triple-a titles
1080 1050 T I like you're not gonna be
able to max games out in 1080p right
unless you're playing some like MOBAs
like you know if you're playing League
of Legends or something yeah you can
sure you probably close to max is on
1080p but the triple-a titles like
you're saying here are going to be
difficult to max out so you're already
limited by that side of it if you were
gaming at a higher refresh rate then
you're already kind of making a
compromise in that respect right because
the 1050 Ti is longer League benefit you
the higher frame rate that's gonna
bottom IQ from a CPU perspective you're
probably gonna be good for the next two
or three years I mean really whenever
you start to notice that your games are
lagging behind and you can't bump the
settings any longer that's when you
should upgrade and it's totally
dependent on a person and the types of
games that you play so I really can't
answer that it's all up to you okay here
I'm scrolling down to the good stuff
Contra says when you're talking about PC
peripherals it's Mouse's Greg I don't
know I've heard people say my stewed
like I don't think that's a rule I've
heard a lot of people say mice like
gaming mice you don't say gaming mouses
Mouse's isn't a word I don't thank you
that's why it's called mice it's like
saying dear and dears like no one says
beers cuz it's not a word he just it's
not really good analogy begin trying to
say okay scrolling down here I don't
know why YouTube sometimes blocks
comments so like perfectly fine matech
city at brian says wrong greg you were
going to need a twenty nine ninety WX to
play League of Legends dude I'm gonna
have to like DM you on the low so you
can give me that Cinebench score because
I want to know how that thing crushes
and eventually I'm so like the 79 80 XC
at like four point two will get around
4000 CB but we're talking like I mean 32
cores like anything past 30 cores is
always breaking
sane 32 when we get up to like 36 and
for you some of those eons I'd like what
44 cores
it's just insane I don't know I can't
picture you know I just can't picture 32
cores going crazy like that but I go
definite have to fill me in that sounds
pretty awesome yeah see Adam Stephenson
says he says it's gaming mice so ha gave
me mice sad cuz chief says logitech g502
is the best i've heard good things about
that Mouse that's a good Mouse project
zero games with gaming mouses it's just
uh western bear prefers nice you know
gaming nice I should just troll people
whenever I review any peripheral and I
like it's involving a mouse and I'm
talking about more than one I'm just
gonna say gaming Meese and I'm totally
gonna ignore all the like hate that I
get in the comments for you know
everyone every time you say something
incorrect everyone is sure to jump to
the comment section and that's
rightfully so um guy they do but it's
just funny how so many people do like
they'll see other people already
commented the same thing and they'll
feel like commenting in any way just
because it makes them feel good I don't
know but like doing that is what I kind
of look for because I have reading some
of your comments sometimes are really
interesting especially if I troll you
and like I know I'm trolling you it'll
really good Contras this not making fun
of me I'm sorry it's okay you might have
been trolling me a you should just play
that card it's easy whenever you do
something dumb and you did it
intentionally but nobody knows you did
it intentionally just say ah I was
trolling you and then you're off the
hook right that's easy let's see Hasek
oh three want to get music production
should I just get a MacBook I know
plenty of people using mac books for
music production I don't want to
recommend a MacBook you could get by
with any other only choose a mouse mouse
while only choose a MacBook if you want
mac OS software so if you want to use
some proprietary program with in Mac OS
you can get obviously on Windows then go
with the MacBook but that's really the
only scenario in which I would recommend
a MacBook over a window
counterpart okay listen gaming Muhsin
let's see Steven Johnson what do you
think about rate racing I have videos
touching on the technology behind rate
racing haven't talked specifically about
rate racing yet so I'll be sure to get a
video out soon and science episode we'll
do on ray tracing and hopefully you guys
enjoy that one the last couple minutes
science videos we didn't get many views
on so you know that's why I haven't been
doing many of them I'm not gonna make
videos lit not a lot of people want to
watch because I'm not in the business of
pleasing few people I want to keep a lot
of you guys happy cuz I can't serve I
was a person running a channel full time
if not a lot of people interested the
content I'm uploading so I'm trying to
get videos out there that a lot of
people are interested or at least
curious about even the extreme stuff
like the d-lighting stuff so we'll see
but I'm sure won't come out soon let's
see let's see yeah yeah that's true you
could always buy a cheap laptop and
hackintosh it I mean yeah you'd have to
that's true but hackintosh is I've
looked at all the stuff you gotta do to
hack some of those computers pack it you
know throw in mac OS and it's it's not
easy do not give them ideas in most
cases the plural of mouse is mice but
more than one computer mouse can also be
called Mouse's where did you get that
from West West that sounds interesting
but I'm not buying it I'm not I can't
buy it I don't believe it Quinny boy
what do you wanna do in the future I
want to be able to do YouTube part time
kind of like how I was in college which
I was still basically doing full-time
and I won't have a real job at the same
time I think having a real job it gives
me the benefits right health benefits
insurance and retirement benefits that I
don't get working for YouTube full time
but at the same time I can still enjoy
you know being able to create videos for
you guys having passive income kind of
on the side I think that would be the
best of both worlds so we'll see very
soon what do you think of advancements
in gaming on Linux I don't gaming Linux
I don't use Linux much at all I don't
really like Linux I use Linux once on a
Chrome
what can I hated it and then everyone
back that's just me it's just not my cup
of tea
Lance West why not liquid metal on the
direct dye because I said in that video
I wanted to show the difference between
stock Intel Tim and mx4 that was the
point of the video so I didn't go out
and buy liquid metal because I wasn't
planning on doing that but when I
realized that I had been sent a direct
dye kit yeah that would have been a
better option but I'm not it's not a big
deal I did want to show the difference
between regular mx4 mainstream thermal
compound and Intel Tim that was the
reason okay by Zynga again another fire
let's see which I my dude but what about
a mouse after Pepsi gets ahold of it
it's really funny actually
whenever I'm playing games or whatever
if I'm just surfing the web you know you
have your mouse on screen right and
Pepsi will see that on screen and she
will chase it and show claw I'm sure she
scratched this monitor quite a bit and I
love this - oh that Asus 165 Hertz 1440p
monitor I bought this myself it's my
baby and she scratched the crap out of
the ones and I was like oh you know when
you see it happen you're just like
there's nothing you can do about it you
have to just stop and stare and cringe
that was my experience and I dreaded it
Oh Wilson at everyone pug jihad doesn't
work here I had to ask we'll stop adding
everyone in discord because every time
we want to play this chord we try to get
people to own every time but we try to
get people sometimes from discord to
play with us and whenever we add
everyone people always complain so gotta
keep people happy got to keep the peace
let's see by the way why do you love
streaming at this exact time and 6 a.m.
here that's because it's not 6 a.m. here
because I don't live in your time zone
so for me it's like it's night it's like
9 I start at 9 p.m. CST I can't stream
at the perfect time for everybody
because the world is round and then you
know the way it works it's gonna be
nighttime somewhere so I'm sorry but
thank you for stopping by especially
this early in the morning watching a
live stream on Tech and Jesus you are
awesome Carlos Torres have you ever done
any videos for the lioness that is a No
would be cool $2 I feel like you
wouldn't because I'm so much smaller
than he is but I mean it would
definitely benefit me way more than one
benefit to him and he knows that and I'm
sure that's one of the reasons why but
it's not something that I'm gonna beg
for I strive gee yeah I've been
researching both of them I do have four
fans in my case but I'm totally reading
that out of context totally out of
context drew Garber what do think about
the ROG gaming phone I think it looks
silly I think it looks too like blah
bloated I mean it's cool it's it's
pretty the technology behind it how they
cool it all that stuff it looks really
cool but really cool but I don't think
that it's a phone I would ever entertain
as like a daily driver just because it's
so weirdly shaped and I'm just yeah okay
well gaming PC's get a small smartphones
in the future maybe in ten to twenty
years from now I'm sure I mean look how
much smaller we've gotten smartphone I
mean this isn't even like a small phone
we made him bigger because of screen
size right that we could have gotten a
lot smaller than this we really want it
so yeah I'm sure at some point we will I
think will be limited more or less by
will have Thermal limitations more than
anything I don't think we'll be
constrained by power we see how
efficient things are getting over time I
think will be more and more constrained
by temperatures so if we can figure that
out then yeah that will be where we go
excuse me
let's see here well maruka says every
time I comment he's not looking at the
screen I'm actually looking to screen a
lot like the comment sections right here
I look at it a lot but I just read that
comment so you totally miss your
opportunity to actually ask your
question in that comment instead you
wanted to say that I'll look for you
Willmar I'll look for you oh let's see
blade slash says you should do some rig
pimping on your live stream comment on
people's builds aesthetics yeah we can
do that that's fine what we can do is
maybe we'll put together a little mini
series where you guys send me pics of
your rigs and I'll critique them in
actual videos you know like the other to
be cool content I know it's definitely
something other people have done before
but you guys know what I do on
Craigslist and stuff so maybe you want
like my perspective I don't know if you
think it's worth it or not but if you do
think it's worth it then I both set
something like that up there soon
let's see scrolling down a couple more
questions here then we're gonna end with
a bang again okay scrolling down
scrolling
now what about Razer gaming phone I
don't I don't like the way it looks I
think the bezels are too big on it and
it just looks a little silly the same
thing like I'm really picky about like
how good a phone looks like I think this
looks super slick like I love the way
this phone looks I wish it was a little
smaller
I don't like huge phones I want to be
able to be able to use it I want to be
able to be able to I want to use the
phone with one hand and not have to like
slide it up and down my hand right so
that's why like I often switch between
this in the iPhone se cuz it's like
4-inch screen much smaller hard to
switch between them but once I'm used to
the smaller screen I love how portable
and tiny it is so if we could get like
an iPhone 10 style phone - the knotch in
like a four and a four and a half inch
form factor that would be the perfect
phone for me but then you lose battery
capacity and all that stuff so it's a
trade-off okay alright one more question
give me one more good question good
question let's see he says I definitely
want your take on a savage studio-style
I'm not gonna like RIP in here build you
guys will hate me if I do that but I'll
be picky if you want me to well have to
gauge do like a survey on Twitter how
like picky you want me to be about
builds and then maybe I'll do it that
way just depend on what you guys want
okay let's see I see some good questions
good stuff good stuff
Brian Staker the next live stream that
streams are always on Sunday nights at 9
p.m. Sunday nights a 9 p.m. CST Central
Standard Time I should say ok I see
Carlos Torres what is love I love his
love his love let's see here
I see good questions you goin in timeout
yeah I saw that ninja sauce okay what
about the new iPhone rumors yeah maybe
eric says asked will you grow out your
beard not know it looks silly when I try
to grow it out what game have you
grinded the most I talked about the
early in the livestream scroll back in
the last room I talked about what game I
play the most thank you for that awesome
like picture of my rig okay cool so you
guys seem to be interested in the rig
thing so if you guys want to send
pictures of your rigs we could totally
do that we'll set up I'll tell you what
we'll do you can submit your pics either
on discord we'll set up a separate
channel for you guys to submit your PC
picture and I wanted to just be like one
side shot I kind of like what awesome
hardware does right and Kyle and Paul do
that thing where they kind of do the
livestream showcase of PCs so we can do
that
but you guys got to send just one
picture don't spam it of the side of
your PC with the window or side panel
off and that way I can look inside your
build so we'll set something like that
I've stay tuned join the during the
discord the public has scored it's link
down below and you'll be able to submit
your builds there Matthew Kirkman asks
did you go to Troy University from
Alabama I did go to Troy for one year
before I went to tu well that was a
business major then I switched to
engineering school and and that was
where I ended up graduating let's see I
strive G I answered one of your
questions before I can't answer all your
questions like this says do rip me broke
he never answers my questions I answered
they're playing people on the street who
haven't answered your question like who
haven't had their questions answered so
if you expect all your questions to be
answered you will be disappointed every
single time Carlos de squirrel check the
it's the discord link is in the video
description so just click on that and
that's that's the link let's see what
streaming software are you using good
question I'm using stream Labs OBS just
straight upstream Labs I'm not using OBS
even though it's the OBS compatible
thing but I use stream labs for
streaming
and let's see is an RX 580 and i-5 8400
good for winning games on high at 1080p
sure that's a good combo there that's
some Coolermaster AI oh it's amusing one
right now in this 2700 rig and it's
pretty quiet keeps it nice and cool
pretty cheap affordable looks clean it's
a good oil and this is just a 120 milli
IO let's see here tech crimson spamela
