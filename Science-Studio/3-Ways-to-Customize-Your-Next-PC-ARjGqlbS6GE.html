interested in balling on a budget what I
mean by that it's customizing a case
customizing components in your PC build
without breaking the bank
then this video is for you I've got
three hot tips ways for you to make your
build look unique different from all the
rest by painting by adding custom slave
cables and by doing a few other things
that you might not be comfortable with
upfront but it will certainly make your
build look different than any other out
there you can take one of these to heart
you can take all of them to heart and
throw it in your next build I don't care
but these are options that I've
considered in the past and have done
myself to make my builds look unique so
if you're interested keep watching
the first thing I want to cover is
painting and I'm gonna bring this up
first because it is probably one of the
most daunting things you could possibly
do with your components right painting
things could potentially ruin the
components especially we don't isolate
the parts you want to pay properly and
it's a pain to get this painted
particularly off so I do recommend more
Stoli and painters touch something along
these lines paint plus primer is
important so it's gonna look slightly
glossy versus like a matte finish with
most of the Plasti Dip south or unless
you throw a plastic gloss on top of it
which again is another paint job in and
of itself so in the important thing
about this paint that was it bonds to
plastic and most of the stuff we'll be
painting in here that are plastic or
metal so this is kind of an all-purpose
painting tool that we're going to use
again though some people would swear by
other brands other types of pain I've
used this stuff a lot in the past and
it's good for me so if you want to copy
what I'm doing I don't think you have a
problem as long as you're at least you
know somewhat familiar with spray paint
so I think in this build you can see
it's pretty blacked out this is an r7
2700 bill with an MSI X 470 motherboard
X 470 and we have a cable management bar
that I think we'll want to paint and I
think we're gonna paint the SSD trays
here and maybe the tray that's behind
this SSD from Samsung I think that
that's really all we want to do here I
want to go overkill make this whole case
yellow we might paint something special
up front with this front panel but I
think for now the cable management bar
is begging to be painted and we can
remove it there are only two screws up
top holding it and I think two screws
down below and then when we paint that I
think the yellow bar is gonna really
stand out but I think it'll be just send
out well because it's not gonna be
overkill right the whole case isn't
gonna be all on the inside just the bar
and it's gonna be a nice touch I think
so let's go ahead and take that out
paint it and we'll see what it looks
like
now one thing you want to watch out for
especially when you're painting
components like this or just even pieces
of simple plastic this is a cable shroud
here from NZXT we want to get rid of
stuff that we don't want painted so this
right here is a little cable management
clip there are two of them behind the
shroud and we want these taken out
before we paint because these are gonna
be difficult to paint right there
there's a lot of crevices in here a lot
of creases that paints not really gonna
reach very well so it's gonna look
unevenly distributed so we can remove
these by a simple Phillips screws here
and here and then I will be good to go
so again isolate what you want to paint
don't try to paint around stuff that you
can easily remove
all right so the fourth coat of paint is
drying I recommend four to five coats
maybe more maybe less depending on how
you know vigorous you're applying the
paint and first place but four is good
for me and I've pretty much covered
everything including the side rails but
you're not going to see to be honest but
you know that the top part is very easy
because it does have quite a large
surface area but the sides are also
important and you'll see the edges here
kind of going all the way across you
want to make sure you paint those as
well so rotate this thing you can see I
use a little piece of cardboard to prop
it up just a little bit off the ground
because sometimes the paint will stick
to the edges and then we pull it up
it'll tear some of the paint so this is
just you know little things that I've
learned over time to try to manage as
you go but I think it looks really good
the color is looking more like a baby
yellow but this is actually gonna be for
Lisa it's or temporary yellow theme
build that I promised her until we get
the custom loop around and she loves
this color so that's really all I'm
concerned about you can also see I used
like an old Amazon boxed I kind of just
turned it into my own little paint
studio and I recommend trying to close
off your painting process from the
environment because if any dust does you
know get onto the object while it's
being painted you're gonna have a bad
time trying to clean that up especially
if you paint over it again you're gonna
have little bubbles and ridges and it's
not gonna look very smooth and clean
like it would from the factory so again
try to close off your environment I
recommend doing this inside if you can
although I know you don't think it with
the paint smell inside you can take it
outside but try your best to close it
off because if like I said any dust or
anything from outside
touches the paint or the paint job but
if you have any humidity outside
especially live in the south it's gonna
be a pain to deal with if you don't have
you know ways to mitigate that I use a
box even indoors it's nice to isolate
your object of trying to paint and I
think it turned out quite nice alright
so while the remainder of our paint
dries in this box right here I want to
talk now about cables custom cables go a
long way now you don't have to spend 200
or 300 bucks on a you know a custom
sleeve kit like let's say from cable mod
if you buy it you know a pro sleeve
cable kit I can cost upwards of two to
three hundred bucks if you want
individually sleeve kits with the the
you know the pro editions and the metal
combs and what have you there are
several different options you can choose
from really expensive stuff down to the
really cheap stuff that they sell just
little extensions and I recommend if
you're on a budget going with just
extensions you can get extensions for
fairly cheap
I think it
kit 24 pin a pin EPS you know - eight
pin VGA s or two 6-pin VJs but have you
for around 100 to 150 bucks that's not
too bad look if you're weighing
aesthetics though you're gonna have to
open your mind up to the fact that gonna
be paying more for these extra you know
beauty products if you will they're not
gonna enhance the performance of your
system in any way but they're gonna make
it look so much better and unique at
that so I wasn't planning on showing you
all of these this is my little briefcase
here of just extra cables that I have
laying around it's just a few kits I do
have most of them actually running in
current pcs but I wanted to show you
this one in particular this is actually
from primo chill once the autofocus
works out this is a very cheap cable
extension and a good thing about
extensions is that they work on any
power supply right there Universal
because all the extensions are universal
so any ATX ITX modern you know
motherboard this is gonna work with any
modern power supply so this runs about
20 bucks you know this isn't expensive
at all versus running a full sleeve 24
pin cable straight from a power supply
with which the cables dedicated would
cost you upwards of you know 40 50 bucks
in some cases so cheap extension much
cheaper you can tell that the quality is
not quite there these are thinner cables
so sleeving is just kind of pre done
nothing
handmade about it but it will get the
job done so it'll look different from
just the generic power supply cables
leaving if it's sleeved at all and it's
not going to break the bank now this kit
that you're looking at was actually
configured via cable mods configurator
website these are pro series cables here
and I had these runs specifically for
the g3 series from EVGA EVGA for the
most part uses the same pin out for all
their power supplies but I'm gonna be
using it with their p3 so you know the
p3 their g3 850 unit for leases bill so
these cables look much better in my
opinion
you can tell that the cables themselves
like the gauge is you know these are
much much lower Gate I guess I should
say so they're thicker thicker cables
thicker sleeving
and then we have metal combs and these
combs again these are being that they're
metal they're not gonna break like the
cheap plastic ones that you get on some
of the lower end kits this kid does cost
around 200 to 250 bucks for you know
full-on like 24 pin to VGA eight pins to
VGA six pins and an 8 pin EPS also just
generic molex and SATA cables that
aren't pro they don't have Pro for those
yet but this whole kit cost around two
hundred two and fifty bucks so it's
gonna cost a lot more
but you're getting quality with this and
I can't wait to see what these look like
when paired with that cable bar that we
just painted from NZXT so just something
I wanted to point out cable Maude is not
a sponsor this video but I do appreciate
their work quite a bit and I'm just
telling you if you if you really favor
the customization aspect of your build
and custom sleeve cables are the way to
go whether you go cheaper expensive it's
gonna set your build apart from the rest
now it's kind of a bonus customization
option here before we get to our third
major talking point I wanted to bring up
these Noctua in ff12 fans so I have a
couple of the 140 ml variants as well
but what makes you special is that you
can actually change the little rubber
vibration mounts here on the corners of
the fan so you can just remove them just
like so and actually one fan kit comes
with six different colors I believe so
white green blue or red black and yellow
and then you can see I have black on the
other side here just because it's not
gonna be seen as it gonna be pressed
against the backside of the case so we
have yellow up front and this of course
fits with our yellow theme and if I want
to swap these fans into another bill
that let's say is running a blue theme
then I can swap these little rubber
vibration mounts off for the blue ones
so very nice that you can change these I
like what notch was done here like that
the fan is black and not that weird
brown tan color you learn to love it
eventually because macho fans are very
quiet but these chrome X fans here are
just really good-looking I think and
they're gonna be a little expensive but
they're gonna sound great and again
you're gonna get that customization
option so let's jump into the fourth
point here we have all of our kits
behind us we have the custom sleeves
power supply cables here further to the
right we've course have the Noctua fans
we just discussed we have and this right
here from Arctic Arctic is the same
company that makes the Arctic silver
paste that you've I'm sure heard of
before mx4 I believe is what it's called
this is called the freezer 33 it's an
eSports cooler and it has yellow fans
and I really dig the all-black design
here of the heatsink so we're gonna roll
with this for the CPU cooler I'm gonna
swap out from the stock cooler just
because we're going for yellow theme
here I don't want to throw an RGB cooler
in there just because it's I'm not
really looking for RGB I just want a
yellow accents in general so that's
where this is gonna come in handy and
then we have the bar this is the NZXT
bar I think it's safe to touch now I'm
gonna be careful with it because
sometimes you can
but your fingerprints and paint it's not
totally dry yet now this is a bit off
yellow from the other components we're
gonna have in the system it's more of a
baby yellow like I said but it's gonna
be a nice touch I think it's just gonna
stand off on the rest of the black
interior so let's go ahead and start
assembling all this stuff back into the
case and to see what our end result
looks like
all right so it is day two and I want to
talk about our third tip and this is
gonna be vertical graphics card mounting
now there are several different ways to
do this you could completely mod your
case and set up your own kind of
vertical mount you could use the
Coolermaster vertical graphics card
mount which requires you to cut into
most cases we'll talk about that in a
second or you could use cable mods
vertical graphics curtain mount which
shifts your card just a little further
to the front which might impede some of
your cards abilities to fit in your case
all depends on your dimensions but that
doesn't require case cutting so the
cable mod bracket will be coming out
again soon they had to make a couple
revisions to finalise things it was sold
for a while but they're fixing something
is associated with a cable because it's
difficult to get cables routed through
the back so I stay tuned for that but
this one here is the cooler master
bracket we're used for now because it's
really all we have and it will get the
job done but over here you can see that
I've actually just assembled a founders
edition gtx 1070 and I decided that I
want to paint part of this so I'm not
gonna paint the whole thing it would be
just you know overkill yellow at this
point but I'm gonna paint this part
right here so this is typically black
you can see it's black now but we're
gonna paint this yellow and I think
it'll look pretty cool when it's paired
with the silver in here and we do again
remember have just a tiny hint of silver
in the cable mount cables so I think
it's gonna look really good let's take
this outside and start painting it now
all right you can see this is starting
to come along this one's more difficult
because it has several little creases
and bends to it it's not a simple you
know flat piece like the cable bar was
from the s340 so we're just gonna have
to try to manage this one as best we can
and hope that it is at least maybe like
a 1 foot monitor 2 foot mod I don't
recommend painting stuff like this
unless you are confident that you have
enough patience for it and that you're
careful enough with it right not to
touch the paint while it's drawing
because once again you get finger prints
in it and stuff like that then it's very
difficult to fix so I think we'll do
probably a couple more coats I'm gonna
rotate this around and get the backside
of it and make sure that the top is
coated because the top is what we'll see
the most and then hopefully we'll be
able to finish this build off now while
the graphics card finishes drawing I
want to talk about this last part and
that is vertical graphics card mounting
and I'll have a video fully dedicated to
this installation process
I'm not gonna bother showing you every
step that video is linked in the video
description it'll show up in a cart up
top I'm sure at some point throughout
the video but we're gonna install this
I'm going to show you what you need to
cut and then we should be good to go
reassembling the graphics card and then
mounting this vertically by the way this
cooler master kit does include as long
as you're sure that you pick the right
option when you go to buy this it does
include a riser cable make sure you buy
the one with the riser cable don't
expect you guys to just have one of
those laying around and their riser
cable will actually fit perfectly with
this bracket and that's exactly what you
want to look forwards it'll really clean
you know the flush finish and you
shouldn't have any issues because their
riser cables are actually pretty good
all three of the ones they sent me
worked out of the box not sure if they
tested those beforehand but I haven't
seen too many bad reviews coolermaster
riser cables so so far so good let's go
get this thing installed and then now we
should be able to call this one finished
hopefully it's been two days now so
let's get started
so what I'm gonna do first is line this
bracket up beforehand kind like a test
fit meant so we can see exactly where we
need to cut so with this thing already
all the way in there let's see we need
to cut about here on this side and about
here on this side to make way for our
graphics cards rear i/o so this is the
included riser cable from the cable
market and you can see it just connects
to the bracket like so there's a one
hole on this side and then one hole over
here and you can use the screws that are
included in the kit to secure the riser
cable to the bracket and there you go
and installation from this point out is
pretty straightforward
all right and the last thing to do is to
plug in the ape in supplemental VGA
power cable and we should be good to go
that cable by the way is all yellow so
it should complement this kind of baby
yellow I don't we gonna call this like
partial shroud whatever and then I think
that's it for the rest of the system
where the cable managed at the rear so
this system is basically ready to go as
is
and here you go this is a fully custom
PC I would say I mean we've done
everything we can to make this look our
own I think if you put this next to
something that you can just build
straight up right now off of New Ager
Amazon this would definitely catch
people's eyes because they know that it
took time right to get these colors
coordinated to paint the stuff that you
painted the custom sleeve cables the
custom mounted fans I think everything
in here looks really well coordinated
especially if you're into a yellow
themed bill now this is for Lisa so she
wanted yellow and that's why it's yellow
you might not like the color I totally
get it you know this is a more or less a
subjective thing but for her she likes
it that's all I'm really worried about I
do want to know what you guys think
though about the process in general the
three steps that I showed you guys you
know if you're worried about of course
cutting in your case you can scrap the
vertical graphics card mount some people
don't even like the way this looks and I
get that the air flow issue though is
pretty much solved here because the card
is pushed far back enough against the
motherboard that there's plenty of space
between the fans on the card or in this
case a single blower style fan and the
tempered glass panel so it's not really
being choked for air at all the only
issue you really have to worry about is
the riser cable being of good quality
and this one from Coolermaster typically
always is again though I do wanna hear
what you guys have to say about this
building a comment section below be sure
to give this video a thumbs up we
thought it was cool share it with your
friends if you thought it was super cool
share them at least one of the three
tips I mean painting stuff isn't super
easy and vertical graphics card mounting
is a super easy but this is a price you
pay for getting a built look unique
right traditional pcs just look a little
less now alright because a lot of people
have custom built pcs but this is a
truly custom build because we did paint
we did cut into the case we vertically
mounted a graphics card and we also have
custom sleeved cables I think all three
of those are going to set you up for an
artistic build one that's definitely not
gonna look like it came out of a cookie
cutter you know what I'm trying to say
there be sure to subscribe if you
haven't already to catch us in the next
video here on the channel this is
