I think it matters more in the case of
laptops than it does for desktops
because we can usually tune things that
did better with desktops we can optimize
air flow we have a ton of space to work
with laptops on the other hand are meant
to be small and compact well most of
them so what will attempt to do in this
video is replace the stock thermal
compound atop the CPU in this particular
laptop if you have a dedicated graphics
chip you can also do this for that as
well with some aftermarket third-party
thermal compound that should lower our
core temperatures by a substantial
enough amount that we can notice we
might not have any more thermal
throttling if that already persists and
we also might have a quieter system
overall because the fan will have to
spool up to get rid of those excessive
temperatures coming from those cores so
that further ado let's go ahead and tear
this laptop down and see if we can well
make that big of a difference now before
we tear into our laptop we want to run a
control test we want to know how our
temperatures fare before we swap the
thermal glue for some aftermarket glue
and we expect that our temperatures
should drop after the change so after
running i-264 for around 20 minutes core
temperatures leveled off at around at 95
degrees Celsius which yes is extremely
hot but I mean what do you expect in a
laptop this side so this entire form
factor is one big compromise you're
constricting airflow you can't put as
many copper heat pipes to conduct the
heat away from the CPU because space is
so limited so we're going to see if just
changing one variable the thermal paste
applied on top of the CPU and make that
big of a difference let's say enough of
a difference to prevent thermal
throttling that you're seeing below the
throttling is anywhere from 5 to 15
percent which means that our CPU is
being held back from running at its full
speed from being able to execute tasks
at its full potential because our laptop
is not getting rid of that heat quick
enough so it's compensating by lowering
frequency the goal is to introduce only
one variable the thermal compound apply
to top the CPU and I GPU is that one
small change significant enough to lower
core temperatures by a fair amount let's
also include another goal prevent
thermal throttling can we prevent
thermal throttling altogether by just
changing the CPU compound let's start by
tearing open the laptop so the only two
tools I needed to tear down this XPS
tene we're a t5 Torx screw head and a
very small Phillips head screwdriver
sorry by removing the Torx screws
surrounding the underside of your laptop
in my case I had eight of them I also
had a very sneaky Phillips head screw
underneath the little XPS panel you'll
want to be very patient this next step
prying off the back panel most of the
time you will have to do that for a
laptop of this caliber I use a very slim
guitar pick you also use a very slim
credit card something all those lines to
pry off that back panel it will be
latched in a few places well with the
back panel off you'll likely find a very
large battery to the south along with a
motherboard CPU if you have a dedicated
graphics chip that will be where that is
as well and then either solder DRAM or
dedicated memory modules depending on
how yours is configured and constructed
you might have to remove your battery
and/or speakers maybe even your MDOT to
slaughter your hard drive to get to
where you need to remove the CPU heat
spreader which is where we're going with
this video I've included the process
visually here but you might not need to
do that in my case I didn't have to
remove anything at all other than the
back panel you can literally unscrew
these four screws here and have access
to your CPU directly I'm not going to
lie I expected a bit better of Dell look
how nasty and flaky this thermal
compound is not good not the consistency
we're looking for you can tell it's
basically already past its prime
remove this compound with a lint-free
cloth and isopropyl alcohol preferably
above 90% also remove the thermal
compound that was stuck on to the copper
base when everything is nice shiny and
dry apply your third party compound of
choice I've chosen not to it for while
obvious reasons apply sufficient thermal
compound not too much to where it's just
oozing all over the place but not too
little to where it's not properly
spreading over the entire die that's the
shiny mirror again on top of the CPU
chip you want to make sure it's covered
completely you also don't want to lift
up once you press it down because you
can capture air bubbles in that compound
and that's not good for heat transfer so
once you have an adequate amount I know
people are going to say oh that's too
much Gregor
oh that's too little trust me I've been
doing this a lot it's probably my
sixtieth time applying thermal compound
it's it's fine it's fine
reinsert the copper pipe and secure
appropriately I say that because in
people on Twitter can attest to this
this very laptop would not post unless I
loosen the screws that we're holding
bracket in place literally the only
thing I changed was how tightly these
screws were secured and then boom the
laptop booted up without a problem and I
was ever switching literally everything
I took the m2 out I removed the battery
I tried just posting straight from the
AC power adapter I didn't know what the
heck's going on so do as I say not as I
do save yourself a few hours and do not
overtighten that CPU block reinstall the
components you removed beforehand make
sure everything is plugged in properly
and then give it a good old fresh boot
if all is well your laptop should post
you should either be thrown into your
bios in which case it would just say you
know your clock has been reset because
your your seamless battery was dead for
a short amount of time or whatever or
it'll throw you straight into Windows or
whatever operating system you have and
then you should be able to run your test
again and see if your thermal swap
resulted in some significant core
temperature drops I even decided to
compare idle temperatures I'm glad I did
because idle temperatures drop by about
3 or 4 degrees as well that's
substantial that's enough to not burn my
lap as much if I'm just I don't know
watching Netflix or something and under
low after about the same amount of time
core temperatures were about anywhere
between 5 and 10 degrees lower but at
the same time if you check this out
below 0% of thermal throttling
throughout now I did throttle initially
that was because the fan didn't actually
kick in until after the CPU temps that
already reached 95 degrees Celsius once
the fan kicked on as it did in our first
control test everything pretty much
leveled off at around 85 degrees Celsius
no significant temperature drop there
for our CPU cores as well as a reduction
in thermal throttling to literally zero
that is excellent news so the moral of
the story if you're willing to get a
little down and dirty with your laptop
disassemble a few things if you have the
tools necessary to do so you can
actually swap your thermal compound keep
your laptop a bit quieter it was I wish
I had run fan tests and like fan noise
test before and after because this is
actually a quiter system as well
especially when it was running high to
64 so your fan will not kick on as much
and when it does it won't be as loud
because your CPU core temperatures are
being mitigated better by the better
thermal compound on top of that core
temperatures in general will be lower
and you won't have to worry about any
thermal throttling if it existed
beforehand so apart from my little
regarding over-tightening the cpu block
which was just news to me I never run
into the issue before I do recommend
this to anyone who regards him or
herself as a very tech-savvy individual
even if you're not very comfortable you
can find forums or teardown guides the
process should be fairly simple to
follow with that if you like this video
