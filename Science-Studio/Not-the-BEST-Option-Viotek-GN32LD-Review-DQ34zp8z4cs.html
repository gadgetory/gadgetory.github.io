writing this review coming from the pic
Co px 2 7 7 H I didn't feel as though
things could get much better in this
category I mean sure there are
variations both in terms of size and
resolution refresh rates also something
to consider but I knew that the overall
appeal of the pic Co panel when seen in
the context of its price would be a
tough one to top that video by the way
can be watched right here so when asked
to review the G + 32 LD from via Tech I
hesitated could this beastly panel
actually change my mind let's start with
a clean slate this is a 32 inch 144
Hertz 1440p freesync VA panel it's
slightly curved sporting an anti-glare
coating and very big in my opinion 32
inches is a little too big even for a
1440p display assuming you sit within 2
or 3 feet of it
first-person shooters especially are
awkward to play on this panel whether it
be csgo or even Call of Duty this aspect
is entirely subjective but I do want to
disclose up front that I'm not the
biggest fan of 32 inch panels for gaming
now in reference to image quality things
are actually looking pretty great 2560
by 1440 at a diagonal screen size of 32
inches yields a ppi of approximately 92
placing its density roughly 10% lower
than that of an equivalent 27-inch panel
something elses panel Sports is a curved
aspect with a radius of 1800 R meaning
that the screens curve would form a
circle with an 1800 millimeter diameter
if allowed to extend this scale explains
the metric in a little more detail it's
difficult to visualize and you're just
hearing me talk about it the lower the
r-value in a nutshell the sharper the
curve 1800 R is actually pretty sharp
meaning only the person sitting directly
front and center will truly benefit from
this some like the curve others don't in
my opinion I preferred an ultra wide
panels but it doesn't hurt in this case
it is not though something I would pay
extra for if I had the option it makes
you feel a bit more immersive but that's
really about it this monitor has a
native 6 millisecond response time with
an overdrive function cutting that in
half although I will say that you know
I'm not one of the best when it comes to
being able to visualize imperfections
and monitors I don't play first-person
shooters at a really fast pace all the
time but I noticed ghosting on this
quite a bit of it actually more so than
I'm used to even on a typical five to
six millisecond panel also I was so
intrigued by how blurry some of the
images look during these tests that I
swapped this panel for the px 277 H just
to confirm that what I was seeing wasn't
just me I don't know using some sort of
implicit bias to justify why this panel
was bad I could visually tell there was
a distinct difference between the
vo-tech panel and this pixel panel here
running this test in particular the via
text image just looked so much more
blurry basically when it was scrolling
across a screen while the pic CIO's look
very smooth even at this high scrolling
speed that in a nutshell is ghosting
when the image from the previous frame
is kind of left it's like a little
remnant that appears just for a split
second behind the next frame and it
gives you sort of a weird blur a trail
where the image would have been prior
and it's noticeable here and in fast
paced games it will probably be a
problem look honestly unless you're
playing an FPS game you're not going to
notice and I mean that I'd only notice
this when I ran this particular test
here but it is worth pointing out
because many people do play first-person
shooters and I was a little disappointed
despite being VA technology this is the
first panel where I've actually
questioned whether it was my eyes
deceiving me or not because it was so
obvious during a few of these tests onto
some good stuff though backlight bleed
is practically non-existent here a trait
that has plagued many an IPS panel in
the past my px 2 7 7 H didn't suffer
this but many still do and that's why
I'm stating in this video simply put the
chances of severe backlight bleed along
bezels is higher in IPS monitors now
with that said you can probably return
that panel if you complain enough you
know the backlight bleed is obvious
enough usually you can get your money
back the remainder of the panel is
fairly clean a small red vo-tech logo
sits dead centre underneath along with
the bezels significantly thicker than
its surrounding counterparts though I
don't really see this as too much of a
problem and when gaming I'm really
bothered by the slim bezels just because
I think the panel is so big it really
doors the tiny bezels around the top
left and right underneath that you'll
find a single DVI port and interesting
inclusion hdmi port a display port and a
headphone jack
now biotech doesn't explicitly state
which HDMI variant this is so I expect
one point for not 2.0 check the
description though for any correction
made to this video I can also confirm
that DisplayPort is one point two not
one point four so we're not the most
up-to-date in terms of our display outs
the on-screen display is the same one
we've seen in previous vo-tech panels
there was really nothing wrong with it
to begin with so I'm kind of glad to see
a similar layout now I know that not
many people you know like the crowded
feel of this OSD but the multiple
customization options are more than
welcome and I'll take that any day the
week over simplicity if you will
physical buttons for the OSD reside
underneath the display toward the right
and are pretty straightforward they're
also very tactile so you definitely know
when you push them the primary issue
that I have with the G + 32 LD is its
sheer size and this monitor easily
occupies 2 feet of depth on a desk and
that's thanks to a few things for one
the AC adapter is integrated now I love
seeing this and it explains why the
panel is a bit thicker but a consequence
of such an inclusion is added weight on
top of a panel that's already very big
this is one of the heaviest panels I've
ever used and WyoTech remedied the
situation with a beefy three-legged
stand and neck the legs themselves
spread out far too wide in my opinion
and the thickness of the neck makes it
seem even larger
I'm not joking this setup is massive and
my 34 inch ultra wide vo-tech panel
let's say for example that has you know
comparable in size not necessarily in
weight requires a much smaller stand I
don't know why they didn't just throw a
smaller stand on this thing and maybe
trim down on some of the weird cosmetic
things going on on the back side of the
panel I mean you're not gonna see the
backside of your panel so why waste time
and money and design effort to sculpt
something that looks ok on the backside
that you'll never see in my opinion that
this culmination ruins the aesthetic
appeal of the monitor taking up too much
real estate on a desk that's likely
already crammed and looking too good on
the side of the panel that you'll never
see on top of this you can't swivel the
monitor left or right so it's not very
ergonomic instead we're just left with
height and tilt support now a vase
amounting is an option but you'll need a
thick that's to see stand to bolster the
weight of this panel looking short I
don't feel this is the best 1440p option
on the market despite its competitive
450 or so US dollar price tag its form
factor may be best suited for console
gaming where
gamer's typically hang out several feet
from their displays though the high
refresh rate here would go unused and to
be honest if you like sitting super
close to a huge 32 inch panel more power
to you it's great to see 144 Hertz and
more affordable panels nowadays and the
bump to 1440p is certainly appreciated
but the stance of this thing just
bothers me too much its footprint is
it's far too big its screen is far too
big and its price tag honestly makes it
an okay deal if you even want to call it
one in all honesty if I had a choice
between this and the px 277 I'd choose
the 277 slightly better color
reproductions with IPS technology no
backlight bleed at least on this panel
though I can't really speak to keep C
concerns as a reviewer because they may
have opened my box beforehand to make
sure nothing's wrong with it a slim
profile and an even lower price that
you'll find on that 277 that's just me
though if you're looking for a 32 inch
option with comparable specs elsewhere
the Jan 32 L D might be the perfect
mother for you and that's fine but for
me it's not you can check out our
affiliate links to both these panels by
the way in the video description you can
let me know in the comments what you
think of both of these gaming monitors
and which one you would choose if you
had the choice give this video a thumbs
up if you thought it was cool dislike it
if you feels complete opposite or if you
hate everything about life you guys can
click that red subscribe button if you
haven't already can join us if you wanna
