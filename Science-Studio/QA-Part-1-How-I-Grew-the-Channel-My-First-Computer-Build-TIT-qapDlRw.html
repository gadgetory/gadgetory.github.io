segment this into just kind of a series
of q and A's because for one I get asked
quite a few questions and a lot of them
were about different topics so which is
great by the way because that's kind of
the point here to learn about a lot of
different things that I don't normally
talk about on the channel but the first
thing I want to cover in part 1 of this
Q&amp;amp;A series if you will is how the
channel started and how I got it to grow
the way that I got it to grow because
when I first started the channel I know
if you've ever gone back in time back to
the very first videos that I ever
produced on the channel and actually I
had some earlier than that that ended up
deleting not long after I made the
transition into PC gaming just because
they were so awful and I know and
looking back I should have kept those
because it's it's a part of the history
of the channel I don't want to say I was
ashamed of them but compared to the
quality of content that we have now it
was night and day and I didn't want to
give people that perception that our
channel produced content that was that
shabby I guess so the the earliest
videos that you will find on the channel
have to do with astronomy physics
geology just all kinds of stuff that
intrigued me personally and that's what
kind of ties into the first question
that one answer here from a dray fighter
on Twitter I'm gonna post all the
questions and Twitter handles right here
you can check them out
so at Wraith fighter asks what motivated
you to start to the YouTube channel and
that ties back into what I was just
talking about with the early science
videos that kind of stuff really did and
still does intrigue me I love learning
about that content some of it was stuff
that I had learned in school that's
another question I'll answer very soon
by the way what my major is and kinds of
classes I've taken but that that stuff
was just interesting to me a lot of the
stuff that I posted in the beginning
when the channel is first created had to
do with space and and the planets and
physics and gravity and all that cool
stuff because that was what I grew up
studying believe it or not when I was in
elementary school by the time I had
reached the third grade I'd read every
single astronomy library book there
in my elementary school in fact by the
fifth grade I was reading physics books
I actually had those in my school in my
elementary school I didn't understand
three quarters of what I was reading but
by the time I got into middle school and
even in high school a lot of the stuff
that I had just kind of absorbed like a
sponge that but didn't still understand
at that point eventually did make sense
when I took classes that had to do with
those topics in middle school in high
school so I was just super intrigued and
and just in all of the universe when I
was really really young and that kind of
curiosity is what fueled my interests
and other scientific subjects I'm always
been a fan of electronics I never
understood how to how to actually you
know craft circuit boards and do all
that fancy stuff but that that kind of
led to the PC part of the channel later
on I was pretty big on consoles for a
while and then I made the transition
only about seven or eight months ago to
PC I built my first PC that's actually
another question I was going to answer
on here sorry this is all out of order I
guess I'm trying to segment these if you
will so add all mighty ruin asked what
were the specs of your first PC self or
pre-built and that first PC that I had
ever built was an Intel i3 4150 so we're
talking has well I three here I had an
MSI z97 gaming motherboard a 750 Ti from
EVGA I had eight gigabytes and to-four
gig variants of Crucial Ballistix ddr3
at 1600 megahertz and then I believe I
believe I had I had taken an old power
supply out of an old server computer
that I had lying around at the house so
it was like an 800 watt but it was a it
was an old bulky gray one you know it
wasn't fancy or anything and it was
overkill especially for what I had at
the time and then I just had an old hard
drive that I had from another build of
Korah that I was something we had just
purchased pre-built but I took the hard
drive out of that and use that as my
storage device so all in all I think
that build cost something like 500 bucks
450 bucks and it was decent I mean
moving from consoles to pcs I expected
gaming to just be you know as fluid I
wasn't really all
that up-to-date with powerful graphics
cards and you know what was worth the
money and what really wasn't and even
back then I mean only seven months ago
really but it seems like a little longer
than that the 750ti is not something
that you just want to throw into a rig
that you expect the game on every day
and expect good results from it's it's
it's kind of like the bare minimum I
would say and more recommended for games
like dota maybe some light World of
Warcraft and stuff like that but not the
games that I was interested in playing
like granteth out of five and city
skylines came out soon after that was a
great game actually may have been out at
the time already I don't I don't know
I'm not following that stuff but a lot
of those games were more GPU intensive
than I had originally presumed and the
750ti wasn't cutting it so you can see
in this picture right here I had an MSI
r7 370 from AMD that was my first
graphics card upgrade and that made
everything so much better huh it's not
twice as powerful as a 70 Ti but it was
a night and day difference in terms of
what I could turn up what I you know how
I was playing the game it just seemed so
much more fluid and even at the time I
wasn't even focused on frame rates I
didn't even know what that was that kind
of ties into the third question I want
to answer so these are all kind of I
love these because these all kind of
work together mr. Alfredo Beltran at
ASAP Alfredo 21 he asks what did you
start when did you start building pcs
when did you start getting a PC tech
building them etc at a young age or
recently great channel man appreciate it
Alfredo so to answer your question that
kind of ties into why the channel
changed from a strictly science channel
to a technology PC gaming channel
because when I when I started the
channel the intent was not to evolve
into a PC channel that I mean I wasn't
even into that at the time I built the
PC so that I could do my edits more I
guess efficiently so when I was doing my
science videos I was editing anyone on
an old cheap laptop and it wasn't
cutting it I knew it wasn't cutting it
so I said I'm gonna build a decent PC
it'll be my editing rig and then I
realized it's like you know what
building a PC it's actually pretty fun
and so I ended up selling that rig and I
built my second PC with the FX 6300 up
there
that was my second CPU I ever owned
and I built that on the asus 970 m58 97
motherboard I'm surprised I even
remember that and the same 8 gigabytes
of RAM I bought a solid-state drive this
time around and then I think I bought an
r9 380 that's what I had and actually
that build is on the channel you can
click it it Worth's which sides gonna be
on I think it's on this side yeah you
can click it right here I think and
maybe it's backwards it's like
reflective I'm looking at myself in the
camera I don't know which way it's gonna
be but you click the card and that card
will take you to my second ever PC build
and while there aren't as many views on
that video as there are on some of the
more recent videos of the channel that
video was what made me realize that
there was a huge demand for PC gaming
and just technology content on YouTube
and I said well you know if I'm gonna
make this channel a success if I'm you
know if I want to see how far I can
really push the envelope and make this
channel grow I needed to make content
that people want to see because people
the time weren't really interested in my
science stuff I know I wasn't being
found on YouTube very easily just
because my stuff was so it was so
specific you know like I was I was
explaining movies and I was talking
about tectonic plate boundaries and
stuff like people don't just go onto
YouTube and search for that stuff they
might for class but it's not something
they're just gonna want to be interested
in most of the time especially when
compared to something like PC gaming so
I basically made the transition into PC
building and technology as a result of
the substantial growth the channel
experienced after that first video I
realized that a lot of people wanted to
see pcs being built they wanted all the
tech porn they wanted to see you know
what worked well with what what didn't
work well with what I said you know this
is it's basically like exercising the
scientific method with computers and on
top of that I'm an engineering majors
then it works out even better by the way
that someone else asked that question
they asked what my major was I'm sorry
I'm trying to do this all in one shoot
so I'll have to edit very much because I
might get these out quickly so that I
can answer as many questions as possible
ok I can't fight it but I know it's been
asked several times in some of the
videos I've uploaded and I haven't
answered those questions because they've
all been the same what is your specialty
in engineering
I haven't answered because I wanted to
save them for this video so while my
major field of study is engineering my I
guess concentration is petroleum which
means that I deal with oil so we
basically extract oil from the ground is
a simple way of putting it
there's a lot more that goes into that
obviously so I take classes like
transport phenomena phase behavior
thermodynamics statics mechanics
basically a mechanical engineering
degree to an extent and then we hit a
point in which we branch away from then
I'd say mechanical engineers are
encompass of a wider array of careers
whereas ours is very concentrated so
when I graduate I expect as if unless I
I don't know start making huge sums of
money on YouTube which has yet to happen
I expected I'll be working on an oil
platform somewhere offshore or maybe in
an oil rig onshore it just depends on on
who ends up hiring me but that is what I
will be doing I expect next year after I
graduate and that's that's my that's my
actual degree that I'm working for is a
petroleum engineering degree I'm also
minoring in geology and pre-mba so I
want to get my pre-mba very where my MBA
on my premia I won't get my MBA very
soon so the pre MBA takes away those
prereqs that I would normally have to
take if I'm not a business major which
I'm not so that's something else I hope
to to have under my under my belt under
mine in my belt under my belt I hope to
have that eventually as well I'm
probably right after I graduate if I
can't find a job when I get up kisses
oil right now it's it's a little sketchy
so I want to end this video with the one
more question and I love this question
because it's pretty much it's open-ended
so at the trixie she asks what is your
main goal concerning YouTube and that my
friends is to learn and that's why at
the end of every video I say thanks for
learning with this because 99% of the
time I'm the one filming I'm always the
one in the shot I'm always the one
editing I'm always the one typing the
scripts and I'm always the one
researching but I actually like that
because it gets me involved too I have
to learn these things in order to be
able to convey them in a way that's
understandable for all of you because
that's that's why you subscribe to this
channel you subscribe to learn and I
appreciate that you can't put a price
tag on someone's dry
motivation to learn and that's what I
hope that this channel continues to do
is is accelerate those curiosities you
have four topics in the tech industry
and PC gaming industry and then
hopefully eventually we'll make a study
transition into just science again in
general things that that are interesting
that many people don't talk about or
necessarily know about that I'll make a
personal goal of mine to learn about as
best I can to be able to then share with
all of you because knowledge is
priceless again you can't put a price
tag on these things it's it's something
that you either have or you don't have
and for those of you who have it thank
you for supporting this channel I hope
you stick by me I hope that this channel
continues to grow because I I really do
love what I do they I mean I'm a full
time college student this isn't
something that I do to make money off of
I'm not making a lot of money off of it
when I graduate I expect that I'll be
working in the field as a petroleum
engineer I don't expect I'll be doing
YouTube full-time unless something
miraculous happens between now and then
next year so I want to thank each and
every one of you again for for your
support for watching this video as far
into it as you have and for sticking by
me because this channel would not be
where it is today without all of you
we've grown in seven months we've grown
from one subscriber my own other YouTube
account that I subscribe to this one for
just make myself feel special to 80,000
nearly subscribers as of July 24th that
that blows me away and it's because of
all of you in all of your interest to
learn again priceless
this is science studio folks stay tuned
for part 2 thanks for learning with us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
