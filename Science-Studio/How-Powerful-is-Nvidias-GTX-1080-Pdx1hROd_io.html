party but invidious GTX 1080 we're
talking two thousand five hundred and
sixty CUDA cores nine teraflops of
floating-point performance and eight
gigabytes of VRAM oh and I should
mention at a price tag that rivals the
GTX 980 t is seems a little too good to
be true I want this video to be a little
bit different because I'm gonna be
honest I mean come on let's be real here
you guys have already seen the other
videos by the other big youtubers in
regards to the 1080 so what I want to do
in this video specifically is compare
the 1080 s performance and
specifications to that of the two
current flagship Nvidia graphics cards
the Titan X and the 980ti as I said in
the beginning a single 1080 pax nine
teraflops of performance compared to the
Titan X is 7 and the 980ti 6.5 if you
want to dig a little deeper than that
you'll find that the 980 s came out to
around 5.3 so it makes sense that when
Nvidia said that 2 980 is an sli
averaged around the same frame rates as
a single 1080 if you just want to add
those teraflops together and assume a 60
to 80% margin for SLI because you're not
really gonna get 2 times the performance
when you SLI anything or crossfire for
that matter you get about 9 teraflops if
you want to add them it doesn't work
like that in real life but you can kind
of gauge what in video was trying to
tell you when they said that so expect
literally twice the performance of a 980
and if you want to sli to 980 s you're
barely gonna scrape the surface of what
the 1080 can handle and for about twice
the price of a 1080 as well that's
pretty phenomenal another cool thing
about the 1080 is the fact that it only
requires a single 8 pin power connector
compare this to the 980 which required
to three pin power connectors on its
reference card now
the TDP s are roughly the same the 1080
does draw a bit more power but keep in
mind it's literally twice as powerful as
a 980 so that's pretty phenomenal in
itself also keep in mind that as
third-party manufacturers begin rolling
out their versions of the 1080 the power
allocation might change so maybe an 8
pin and a 6 pin will be present or 2 6
pins it will vary so just the reference
version is what I'm referred to at this
point in time only because the reference
cooler is the one that you'll be able to
buy come May 27 the 1080 will also house
8 gigabytes of gddr5 XML
which is an improvement upon gddr5 which
you'll find in most modern graphics
cards this new memory will offer clock
speeds approaching and exceeding 10
gigahertz which is about 3 gigahertz
above what the 980 and the ti variants
of the older generation maxwell cards
were able to achieve with their gddr5
memory nonetheless eight gigabytes is
definitely more than enough for 1080p in
1440p gaming now considering this card
seems like it's targeted more towards 4k
gaming and ultra wide 1440p gaming 8
gigabytes it's probably enough for a lot
of triple-a titles in 4k as long as you
don't max everything out but until we
get our hands on the card we won't be
able to gauge how much of Ihram we
should expect to see or need for a card
like this the cards also gonna come VR
equipped which should be of no surprise
at all but one thing Nvidia is saying is
that this card is going to be twice as
fast as the Titan X when it comes to
handling VR workloads which is
impressive in itself because the 1080
only has 2560 cuda cores compared to the
Titan X's 3072
now keep in mind here we're talking
about difference between 16 nanometer
and 28 nanometer architectures that
could play a huge role in terms of power
allocation efficiency and overall
effectiveness and processing these VR
workloads but keep in mind that this is
nvidia claim and no one else's so until
we get our hands on the cards as I said
earlier we're just gonna take that word
for it it does seem a bit hard for me to
personally believe that a card like the
1080 should perform twice as fast as the
Titan X so we're definitely gonna have
to get our hands on one of those and see
for ourselves if this claim is true in
terms of physical appearance not much
has changed between the 980 and the 1080
reference cooler design save a few sharp
edges that have been carved into the top
of the 1080 which you won't see any way
in most cases unless you have one of
those cases that make your video card
juxtapose upright vertically but in most
cases you won't see that what you will
see are the green lettering and the
black backplate that are included with
the card similar of course to of the 980
no surprise there it's very difficult to
see what kind of cooling potential is
housed inside the 1080 but I can imagine
that given both cards reach about the
same temperatures under load the same
cooler from the 980 was implemented into
the 1080 but you can't really fault a
green team for that right I mean why
would they spend more money to redesign
a cooler that already would have worked
in the first place well I seen before I
go in vidi has been a bit misleading
about the actual price of the 1080 so if
you want one ordered May 27th and
shipped May 27th you're gonna be paying
199 US dollars for their reference
cooler stock founders edition 1080 if
you want one for around 599 dollars
which is a market of just a retail price
for 1080 you're gonna be waiting a bit
longer because these cards are going to
be made by third-party manufacturers now
the PCBs will be into the same in most
cases sometimes they change them just
for the heck of it but in most cases the
PCB will be the same they're gonna put
their own third party coolers on the ten
eighty and sell them for around six
hundred bucks this of course is just the
suggested price by Nvidia these Rice's
will very definitely so a card by a
series may cost $650 and a card by
gigabyte may cost 580 dollars I doubt it
but you can see that the prices will
vary so if you want to wait for those
cheaper cards you will have to wait
that's the point but if you want one
upfront Nvidia is charging a $100
premium for their founders Edition 1080
with that said you're getting a lot for
your money this card is phenomenally
fast from what I've seen so far I cannot
wait to get my hands on one in the
studio stay tuned for that if you're
interested in the 980 for whatever
reason that's kind of gonna be a dead
video after this week I imagine you
can't check out the card above me and
you kind of get a sense for what the
1080 will look like in terms of its
actual reference design but apart from
that
stay tuned for 410 ATS everywhere all
over YouTube all over the web seems to
be a pretty good deal right with that
said be sure to get the video a thumbs
up if you think it deserves one give it
a thumbs down if you think it doesn't
and click the subscribe button if you
haven't already stay tuned for more 1080
and 1070 stuff and our Z on 12:30 v5
build from skylake which will be coming
tomorrow actually the last of my parts
should be in tomorrow that'll be an
awesome video stay tuned for that
this is science studio thanks for
