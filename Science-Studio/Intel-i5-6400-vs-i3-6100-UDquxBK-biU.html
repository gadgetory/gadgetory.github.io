studio and yes I finally have it I have
the i-5 first I three match up they have
all been asking me about I have the
benchmarks ready to go they're in this
video and yeah so let's get through the
test bench real quick and then we'll
dive right into those results because I
know you really want to know which ones
better I mean come on we know which ones
better but how much better is the i-5
over the i3 so the cool thing about
comparing to Intel sixth generation
skylake processors is it get to use the
exact same test bench for both it was
literally as easy as you know pulling
the processor out of one and replacing
it with the other so it's not going to
this war using ddr3 over here or over
here you know different different
motherboards you know different
frequencies I got a lot of that in the
i3 6100 vs. FX 6300 if you haven't seen
the video already go and click the link
here but basically people were
complaining that I didn't have similar
parts to compare with I thought it was
unfair you know come on I can't get it I
can't get it perfect I don't have the
resources to get it perfect now I
honestly don't even think it is possible
to get it perfect because they are such
different platforms once so much older
than the other so in this case there
won't be any of that everything we've
used in the test bench is exactly the
same save the cpu so we actually use
that thing right there for the test
bench only we took out that gtx 960 in
there and replaced it with the Sapphire
Radeon r9 380 for gigabyte graphics card
that was used in the I 360 101st FX 6300
video just you know for consistency sake
we wanted to see if the i3 would perform
similarly to the time that it did in the
other video and it did the i3 was very
consistent in its results so the other
parts that we've used are one the azrog
z170 pro for LGA 1151 ATX motherboard we
have eight gigabytes of PNY anarchie
ddr4 we have a kingston 122 byte solid
state drive so this is just for our boot
drive so that everything would be nice
and snappy we have a Western Digital 320
gigabyte hard disk drive just for
general storage this is where all the
games are located and then we also have
an EVGA 430 watt 80 plus power supply
powering everything so that's a test
bench probably don't care much about
that but just know that everything is
gonna be super consistent okay so let's
get into the test that we ran well if
you saw the last video they are exactly
the same so you can go ahead and skip
this part if you want go ahead a click
here go and skip
head to the actual benchmarks but if you
haven't seen our last video I will run
through each of these tests with you the
first of the three CPU intensive tests
is Cinebench r15 various threads of a
CPU are going to be used to render an
image and it will basically distress the
ability for that CPU to run those
multiple tasks simultaneously so that
will be an interesting test for sure
between the IMEI five who both share the
same number of threads we have Geekbench
3 which is going to be next deep bench 3
it's just just going to be the 32
gigabyte free software that anyone can
pick up for free so there's a link to
that in description if you want just
click on that download it see for
yourself what your cpu power and
performance is like now we will test
single core and multi-core performance
of both CPUs and then the third and
final I guess CPU intensive test is
going to be Adobe Premiere Pro so what
we've done is we take in a one-minute
video file and then we're going to be
rendering it through both platforms
through both the i3 in the i5 platform
and the lowest score will win so
whichever processor can render that
one-minute video file using the same
preset the fastest will win that
benchmark test thing and then the three
games we've chosen are dying light Grand
Theft Auto 5 and dota 2 nothing fancy
but we did kind of want to spread the
spectrum out a bit so dying lights a bit
different than GTA at least in terms of
how you know powers allocated and what's
being used when and then dota 2 is just
for those people that don't play either
dying light or GTA and just want to see
how World of Warcraft or dota 2 will
perform on a computer like this so the
results for the first three tests first
up is 7jh r15 and Wow so the i3 scored
431 which I believe was only about four
points off from the first time that we
scored it at 435 so very impressive so
the after he's very consistent there but
the i5 being that it does have two more
physical cores scored 673 so a pretty
substantial increase in performance
there I would say that's probably about
a 60% increase all around that's pretty
good so even though both the i3 and i-5
share the same number of threads
Cinebench r15 likes it's actual
physical course on the Geekbench 32-bit
so single core performance for both of
these CPUs was identical uh practically
the i3 score at a forty fifty one and
the i-5 scored a forty thirty three so
the i3 did edged up a bit of a victory
but they're they're practically the same
for all intents and purposes now this
should make sense though because they're
both based on the exact same 40
nanometers Gothic architecture so if
you're just going to be stressing one
core in both CPUs and those cores happen
to be identical in both you should get
pretty close to the exact same score and
Geekbench 3 definitely proved that now
in the multi-core side of things the i-5
definitely edged out a lead scoring 1353
versus 80 801 the 801 was actually very
consistent to its previous score for the
i3 so that's good too good to know
I guess it's not really surprising that
they're getting exactly the same scores
but that's definitely I guess reassuring
but the i-5 definitely took the cake in
this case now I don't want to take away
from the i3 performance the i3 does
wonders with hyper-threading
so if you're considering an i3 or the
new Pentium skylight processor I would
go I three four threads is definitely
definitely better than two threads so
off from Geekbench 3 and onto the Adobe
Premiere Pro test this one of the three
CPU intensive tests definitely surprised
me the most the core i5 rendered the
video file in practically half the time
it took the core i3 about a minute and
26 seconds this video was a different
video a different one minute file from
the previous video I actually did it on
purpose because I wanted to see if the
actual content of the video affected the
render speed and it did to an extent I
mean it only tacked on I think 4 or 5
seconds for the i3 score but I mean
regardless the i5 just absolutely
demolished the i3 I believe that Adobe
Premiere Pro should have seen that both
processors have four threads and
probably couldn't tell the difference
between the i3 and the i-5 in terms of
which was which so it may have just
assumed that both cry 5s but the i-5 who
47.7 seconds
less than one minute per minute of video
clip to render so a ten minute video
file is going to take you about five
minutes whereas for the i3 for a ten
minute video file is going to take you
about 15 minutes so I thought the i3
performance was great but wow there is a
huge difference between the i3 in the
i-5 for this test that's very surprising
so if you're a video editor definitely
consider the i-5 of the i3 now on to the
stuff that I know you guys actually care
about the video games first up on that
list is dying light now dying light I
presumed in the last video was mainly a
GPU intensive game so I didn't really
think that CPU performance had much of
an impact on how many frames per second
that you received in that game but from
this test here I think I was mistaken
because the i-5 definitely made a
difference you can see that on our
average FPS rate at least 63 verse 50 is
that that's 13 fps that's quite a
difference and the max FPS got all the
way up to 98 on the i-5 whereas it only
touched about 64 on the i3 so I think
what happened in the last video if you
saw that one with the FX 6300 I think
that the six cores of the FX 6300 really
made a difference for dying light that
is a bit of a game changer for me I did
not expect that from dying light but the
i-5 definitely won so you know it's
really no surprise there now on a GTA 5
of the three games that we tested GTA 5
shocked me the most GTA 5 is a very CPU
intensive game as you know so that over
and over and over again the CPU you have
in your system will make a phenomenal
difference on the frame rates that
you'll see in GTA 5 but wow I did not
expect this big of a difference
literally double the average FPS rate
that was insane I don't honestly I don't
really know how to explain it I they
both have four threads that's really all
I can say they both have four threads
and I know that the eff is supposed to
win because it actually has four
physical cores but I did not expect it
to make it that big of a difference and
I'm pretty sure GTA 5 sees the i3 as a
four threaded processor I don't think
just sees two cores in two threads I'm
pretty sure it takes advantage of all
four so I really don't know what to make
of this both CPUs o'clock at the exact
same frequency - honestly this is kind
of confusing to me this one definitely
shocked me the i3 was consistent from
the last set of results that we got from
our previous video so it's nothing on
the i3 side and vsync was off of course
I really don't know what else could have
caused this much of a difference the
presets were all the same but Wow so I
guess what you can take away from this
is well if you like to play GTA 5 a lot
you better get a really good processor
if you want to see like phenomenal
superb frame rates that's really all I
can say about that don't go with an i3
if you like GTA 5 unless you're okay
with 60fps in which case it really
doesn't matter so on from that - I'm
still surprised that's such a big
difference in GTA 4 dota 2 1080p max
everything out turn everything on I
realize that there's a FPS cap on dota 2
I didn't feel like doing the weird
editing and stuff - you know eliminate
that cap but basically you can only get
120 FPS from dota 2 it's just limited
that way so I guess this test is
probably the most flawed because we
really couldn't see how much better the
i-5 did over the i3 and I honestly
didn't realize that in the last video so
the last videos results are probably
skewed as well I will make it out of
that in that video you can see that the
i-5 practically maxed out at 120 the
entire time whereas the i3 yeah we can
say that the 119 is probably 120 I think
that the cap had something to do with
that as well the i3 was pretty much it
was borderline it was close now the
minimum is definitely dropped
significantly more for the i3 you know
when things got intense and everyone was
throwing weird spells at each other I
would say that if you're just a dota 2
World of Warcraft player you know
something like that for going the i-5
and getting the i3 or even getting
something like an FX 6300 not really
going to be a problem there
so it really just depends on pressure
it depends on what kind of games you
like to play and what kind of frame
rates you would like to play those games
at so that's really it that's really all
I've got
the most surprising results were of
course granted out of five and the Adobe
Premiere Pro rendering times for the i-5
compared to the i3 now the i3 is a
phenomenal processor it really is a
great budget processor and I think that
if I had to do it all over again you
know if I was really on a budget I would
still probably go with the i3 just
because most of the games that I like to
play were playable at 60 or 70 FPS with
the i3 but if you're a hardcore gamer or
you render a lot of videos or you really
want to see those extra frames per
second on that 144 Hertz crazy gaming
monitor that you have going with a
processor that has more physical cores
it definitely makes a difference in
every part of your PC life but in
particular intensive games and video
editing and rendering most people are
going to want to do more than just watch
videos on their computers so at least an
i3 at least and I at least an FX 6300 if
you want to go AMD something like that
an Athlon quad-core Athlon to process or
something like that
don't forego the additional threads it
makes a huge difference and if you're
very picky and very particular and like
to do a lot of heavy editing and
hardcore stuff on your computer then
definitely definitely more cores is
better at least that's what I've taken
away from the benchmarks that we
received from this video so that's about
it everyone if you liked the video give
us a thumbs up let us know that you
really like this video I know you've
been waiting at a long time so I'm glad
