playlist I've decided to tackle let's be
honest a rather primitive subject for
most of us who have been building pcs
for quite a while but for those of you
who are watching this channel watching
this particular video and who haven't
tackled a PC build yet I understand
you're likely nervous you're anxious
you're not sure if the parts you've
picked are even going to work together I
have plenty of friends back home who
messaged me all the time asking Greg
does this part work with this part you
know is this the best value of this and
that I'm not going to be able to tackle
every question you might have in this
video but I am going to get through the
basics with you just to show you in
general that this PC building thing is
really not that complicated I remember
back when I built my first PC I had
watched enough videos I had a pretty
good idea of what was compatible with
what and what I wanted to build in terms
of my price category my performance
category and I used a website called PC
part picker to just develop my list make
sure that I had the price right and that
I could find those parts for the lowest
prices on any given site so that's what
PC part pickers for we're going to using
that in this video I'm going to have two
different screens side-by-side you're
looking at them right now and on the
let's say a Left screen I'm going to be
doing an AMD build and on the right
screen I'll be doing an Intel build the
Left screen will be I guess just an FX
build maybe an 8383 50 and then the
right side will be a skylight Intel
build probably an i-5 6500 I think will
go with so you're gonna be looking at
that screen for a majority of its video
I'm just gonna walk you through the
steps that I go through when I build a
PC and if you're looking to build an AMD
PC that's relatively modern then you can
follow along with the steps on the left
side and if you're interested in an
Intel PC particularly a skylight build
then you can follow along on the right
so both sides of the aisle should be
rather satisfied here even though it's
going to be a stretch to justify an FX
build at this point just because then
it's hopefully right around the corner
looking around early 2017 people should
be getting their Zen chips in the mail
it's exciting should be good news for
the CPU market in general bring those
Intel prices down a bit
maybe so what we're going to do is
swivel on over to this side here cuz
just to scoot up a little bit and right
now you're looking at both screens like
I said left side here
is going to be the AMD build the right
side is going to be the Intel build went
ahead and turn the studio light off just
so you know it's not blinding you and I
don't worry I'm not going to be on the
screen for very long so the first thing
that you want to do when you go to this
website here it's linked in the video
description by the way they're not
sponsoring this video or anything like
that this is just a useful website that
I think all beginners should should use
when you're building a PC you want to
well let's see I'm not going to have
that here because I'm logged into my
account but you're going to click start
a new part list and that's what we'll do
for both of these here so starting a
part list and start a new part list okay
now this is your this is your format
your template okay and I recommend that
you pick your parts in this order so
start with the CPU then start with a
cooler if you if you choose one I
recommend that you do and then your
motherboard memory storage a video card
a case power supply those are your key
components right there okay so the first
thing you need to decide when you're
looking to build a PC is what kind of
CPU you want to use I have a call that
you can find in the card right here this
should help you kind of figure out what
CPU you want given the expectations you
have for games and for just raw compute
performance so let's do for the AMD PC
here cool thing is you can just search
for whatever you want
let's do FX okay and right on top there
FX 8350 so let's go ahead and select
that so we have an FX 8350 over here for
Giga it's a core processor for about 139
dollars now the cool thing is PC port
picker will select the website that has
it for the lowest price so if we click
on it's right here this little Settings
icon
if I click if I click that I can choose
what vendor I want to purchase the the
CPU from to kind of give me like let's
say I'm only going to purchase from
Amazon a new egg because maybe I have an
Amazon Prime membership and a new a
premier membership so let's just select
Amazon just for kicks so you can see it
overrode the price and it showed you the
most current up-to-date price on the FX
8350 right now for 147 dollars so that's
cool you can select the the you know the
merchants the
under of the part and it'll it'll be for
the most part accurate with the price if
it's out of stock too it will tell you
that so that's that's nice as well and
over here on the intel side let's do an
i-5 6500 that seems to be a fairly
popular quad-core cpu these days
especially for gamers I think it's a
great budget CPU so that's it we have
both of our processors now let's choose
let's choose a cooler I recommend
choosing a cooler
that's not don't use a stock cooler
register I wouldn't use one let's see a
hyper 212 Evo is a good choice which
wouldn't throw that in there and this
one here we don't really need anything
beefier let's do the c7 though these are
about the same price so you can see on
the left here outlet pcs selling it for
2988 but be careful this is after a $10
million rebate so that's why you see
that promo right there this is after
that so you're really gonna be paying 40
bucks and then like 10 years from now
you'll get that money back from the
rebate if you even mail the rebate to
begin with so let's just do Amazon once
more there and okay you whoops what did
I just do okay sorry about that I had to
open up two separate browsers I'm rockin
edge on the left here and chrome on the
right for some reason whenever I had two
chrome tabs open it was overriding my
CPUs with the latest I'd selected so it
was assuming I was making the same list
on two separate two separate windows but
now that I'm using edge on one it
doesn't appear to be overriding anything
so everything should be independent one
side for each now this is the coolants
just talking about with PC port picker I
can I can select choose motherboard
which is the next step in the process
and the cool thing is it's only going to
show me motherboards that are compatible
with the processor okay so I don't have
to worry about you know figuring out in
the fact that the 8350 is an am3+
motherboard I don't even need to know
that in order to build a PC on PC part
picker it's going to do all that work
for me so any of these motherboards here
will work out of the box with an FX 8350
let's just choose a the 970 gaming I've
owned a motherboard very similar to that
one so 95 bucks a low PC and I'm good to
go
and on the right side here same thing so
we can choose anything from a z170 to an
h1 70 to an h1 10 to a be 150 all of
these are going to work just fine we're
not going to be let's assume we're not
going to basically overclock the i5 so
we're just going to tell you what we'll
do something different
let's choose an ITX motherboard I want
to show you how PC part picker does this
so asrock h1 10 473 dollars right there
Mini ITX okay so there we go
plus we have a mini ITX cooler so that
kind of works out now memory this is the
same same way so you don't have to worry
about whether you need ddr3 or ddr4 it's
going to tell you based on your
motherboard choice
what Ram you can use with with your
platform and you see anything ddr3
basically here let's just choose
whatever is on top the Kingston HyperX
fury blue.you that's gonna look a little
weird because it's blue I'm picky
alright let's find something red and
it'll it's cool it'll it'll tell you
that too so black black will be fine
let's just do right there HyperX black a
little more expensive but whatever and
over here you're gonna see that will
need ddr4 so ddr4 let's just choose a
fixture core lots of one eight gig dim
whatever we can do it alright so there
we go ddr4 25 megahertz for 42 bucks
outlet PC in the new egg over here on
the right for 56 dollars more expensive
just whatever I wouldn't recommend that
for that price but for the purposes of
demonstrations here that's perfectly
acceptable now let's move on to storage
not in the case of storage is not really
gonna matter if you have a really old
platform you might need IDE which is
parallel ata it's not SATA that those
are long ribbon cables for data transfer
if you're doing a really old PC on even
recommend using PC port picker I
wouldn't suggest doing that for your
first PC build anyway but it would tell
you nonetheless if you had any
compatibility there so let's say your
motherboard doesn't support SATA for
whatever reason then you won't be able
to select a drive that works only with
SATA so in this case let's just choose a
Western Digital one terabyte blue
actually no we're going to choose four
of them let's just do let's just do four
so two it's probably a quicker way to do
this than the way I'm doing it
but whatever okay so we're gonna choose
four of these now that's a lot of hard
drives okay that's that's four terabytes
but it's not one 4 terabyte drive it's
four individual one terabyte drives so
PC part Pickers going to warn you if you
have an incompatibility right remember
that it doesn't matter what it is by the
way it could just be it can just be a
case it could be a power supply
you know concern something like that so
if I go here to choosing cases let's say
I want the s3 40 great choice right 67
dollars okay now you see this warning
right here these parts have potential
issues and compatibilities slide down
here to the bottom you'll see the
warning message one additional internal
three and a half inch drive bay is
needed so that means that just natively
that that case is not going to support
for hard disk drives that's good to know
so I can go up back up here and say okay
well I'll take one of those off and then
boom that compatibility goes away don't
worry about the BIOS update that's
something totally different
most of the time you'll be you'll be
good to go there so that's something
else to keep in mind you know you don't
have to worry about you know is this
going to work is this not if it doesn't
work
more than likely PC Pro pick is going to
tell you it's a good indicator that you
have some kind of compatibility issue
and it's suggested that you follow those
guidelines just in case especially if
you're not familiar with building pcs
and this is your first time over here
let's just choose we're going to go with
solid state here because we are building
a rather compact PC I suppose and what
do we have here 525 crucial 125 bucks
okay all right so that's our storage
drive for that one and okay we skipped
the video card here we have any amount
of the case on this side but let's do
the video card next okay so this is
where you can go wild I don't recommend
for your first build you just SLI or
crossfire 2 cards especially if you
aren't familiar with PCIe lanes and how
those work and how those might
potentially bottleneck your system
especially you have other PCI cards in
your system so let's just let's just do
one video card for this particular build
here something like an A 1060 or 480
would be a decent choice 480 and what's
a good price for a 480 this one's not
bad gigabyte g1 gaming for 190 bucks
alright
so there we go that's it that's all we
need we can find a cheapest price on new
egg over here let's do something a bit
different now we're going to want a
small form-factor graphics card mini
okay so you can see this series here
ZOTAC 1050 that's a little under kill we
could go for something like a 1070 let's
do a 1070 but do a small form-factor
1070 so you can see the series here
there kind of give you an idea of of
what size you're going after and we see
the zotac one go ahead and mark that one
up okay not necessarily a small card you
can actually click on this too and see
not a high resolution photo I've give an
idea of what it looks like and you can
always follow the links to so new eggs
is right here if we click on that it'll
take us straight to that exact card that
we selected earlier there's otech 1074 a
little different slightly different
price but we get the point so there we
go
and next for the case here we're going
to on an ITX case so here's another cool
thing about the website you can kind of
sort through these based on all these
different categories up top you can
choose whether or not you want a power
supply included it'll only show those
cases up top that have power supplies
you can select types so right now I have
it sorted to where the largest cases are
on top and if you select it again the
smallest cases are on top so the
Thermaltake core x1 for example the
finnex prodigy you know we see a lot of
cases that are that are fairly small
let's see here the in 60 Manta that'll
be that'll be a cool one let's go ahead
and throw that in there all right and
then lastly power supply if you're
concerned about power supply choice I
have a card right here a video that
should help you out and kind of choosing
what kind of power supply you might need
fewer system most of the time now if
you're just buying a single GPU and a
single CPU for your particular rig and
it's a fairly modern rig especially if
it's an Intel rig anything around 500 or
600 Watts should be perfectly fine if
you're using a very old graphics card
might be power-hungry maybe something
like six or seven hundred watts
especially if you're going for like a
nine Fury or something like that I
recommend at least a 600 watt for that
remember TDP does not mean total power
draw that just means the amount of power
that's dissipate in the form of
so your card or whatever you're looking
at will actually consume more power than
that TDP rating it's just the laws of
nature the second law of thermodynamics
in particular but for a power supply
choice with part picker it's really nice
because all you have to do once you have
everything I've selected is click on to
the power supply and it'll only show you
power supplies that have enough wattage
just to say it's a sustain to sustain
your system you can see the bare minimum
that is recommending right now is four
hundred and thirty watts and that would
be cutting it pretty close will be just
on the edge of our efficiency curve
there so let's go down here to let's
just use a 500 watt now some of these
won't have prices it's I early because
they're not currently available maybe
they're out of stock or they can't find
these particular units on any of the
sites in their database you see they
have quite a quite a few merchants
available the quickest list here you can
scroll you know all of these they're
pretty much looking at non-stop but if
you have that part somewhere let's say
you find out a new egg for 180 bucks but
it's not ringing up for that then you
can manually enter your price here and
that'll be included in your total down
below let's see here let's choose the
Rose well glacier 500m it's a semi
modular power supply for 45 bucks not a
bad deal there okay and they were going
to go now over here I expect that we'll
be able to choose something a bit lower
in wattage yet there we go so 300 watts
is the pair minimum that PC part pick is
recommending for this build and that's
because the 1070 is a very efficient
graphics card when it comes to power
consumption and the i5 6500 practically
sips on power so 300 watts that's
cutting it super close anyway I mean I
wouldn't go for that low but you would
be safe with around 400 430 watts so
just for kicks we're going to choose the
corsair CX 430 m and there we go okay so
what we've just done is put together two
separate pcs there lists on two separate
screens that will work right out of the
box if you assemble all of them together
into a case as long as you install an
operating system there you go that's it
these are the parts that you'll need the
optical drive bays optional operating
system that's a separate thing that's
software not hardware monitor you know
all this extra stuff is is extra it's
not the computer itself it's either
peripheral or something supplementary to
the hardware whoo I didn't realize that
I had a hyper 212 Kibo there that's a
little weird okay there we go but this
is the gist of PC building in my opinion
if especially if you're newbie it should
start right here on PC part picker it's
where I started and it really got the
ball rolling for me it gave me an idea
of what parts would work with with what
parts and you know just the the price
performance ratios of different things
we're gonna buy components is another
big incentive to use PC part picker I
just I really like the the design I love
the list I love the way that they've set
all this up and it's something that I
definitely 100% recommend to anybody
looking to go the PC for at least the
first time another cool thing here you
can see the price changes over time you
can see that it hasn't really been much
of a fluctuation in those parts but okay
if you want to see right here they
gigabyte are X 480 you can see right
there November 17th it actually got a
bit cheaper and then it started creeping
back up so around right here would have
been the best time to buy and that
actually is Cyber Monday so that that's
actually really cool well Cyber Monday
Thanksgiving weekend that kind of area
now this is a total price so it says a
hundred bucks up here but that's only
because it's adding each of these up to
the total and you see right now it's 772
which is just below 800 bucks on the
chart but this is cool gives you an idea
of how part prices change over time as
well there's a lot of stuff packed into
this website you can also just go back
to the home page here and see build
guides from from other people who have
contributed to the website you can see
their list online and see how their
prices kind of match up to yours lots of
cool pictures you know lots of Giveaways
things like that are all on this site
all on PC part picker it's linked in the
video's description
I suggest checking out if you're looking
to build your first PC ever use this
website it is a
GameChanger now i'm aware that i didn't
go through every single thing there is
to consider when building a pc that
video would be hours long this is a
crash course video by the way but at
least this gets you started so the pc
part picker website is the most powerful
tool you have at your disposal
especially if you're new to building pcs
i still use pc part baker from time to
time just because it's nice to see the
price breakdown and where the best place
is to buy that particular part i've also
linked videos in this video description
that should give you an idea of what to
expect when it comes to raw cpu
performance as well as the kinds of
frame rates you should expect from any
given platform from any given graphics
card it's all in the description check
those out all of those videos plus this
one here should give you just a
well-rounded scope just a well-rounded
view of what to expect with any
particular parts list that you decide to
put together a pc part picker that's the
one thing that the website doesn't do is
tell you how powerful that system is
relatively speaking but that's what
videos like the ones in the description
are for check those out check out other
videos other benchmarks on youtube
you'll get an idea for what to expect
how much you should pay for a system
that you're looking to build and for a
resolution that you're looking to game
in with any particular set of settings i
just realized my glasses are super dirty
there we go
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
if you thought it was cool give it a
dislike if you feel like a bit opposite
or if you felt lost in this video in
which case I failed you and I do
apologize
be sure to click the subscribe button if
you haven't already stay tuned for I
keep teasing it I know the cryo rig r1
review I'm waiting on be quiet to send
their beastly air cooler as well so that
I can compare it to this thing see which
one comes out on top I'm sure they're
both insanely awesome air coolers I just
need you know I need a I guess a
baseline to compare this to and I'm also
gonna compare both of them to the Kraken
X 62 behind me see just how close an air
cooler like this can get to an
all-in-one combo on what do you even
call it their all-in-one water loops
all-in-one radiator combo loop all all
in ones I'm just going to stay with all
on one this is Salazar studio thanks for
