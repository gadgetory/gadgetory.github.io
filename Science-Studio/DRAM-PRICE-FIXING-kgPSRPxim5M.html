agreement between entities to literally
lock prices to a certain level the FTC
it's the Federal Trade Commission
characterizes it as an agreement among
competitors that raises lowers or
stabilizes prices or competitive terms
this next part is important
generally the antitrust laws require
that each company established prices and
other terms on its own without agreeing
with the competitor when consumers make
choices about what products and services
to buy they expect that the price has
been determined freely on the basis of
supply and demand not by an agreement
among competitors so the FTC links
price-fixing to antitrust laws which
were set up in the United States to
avoid external collusion between
entities producing consumer goods and
while random access memory may appear
niche on the surface I mean it's not
like milk or bread or something you need
to survive
it's still a highly demanded product
driving massive revenue streams for
companies like Samsung hynek's and
micron it's important note that these
three companies share between 90 and 95
percent of the DRAM market and therein
lies the problem you see memory
manufacturers in a perfect competition
model which we should note it does not
exist but we use it as a reference point
attempt to meet the demands of the
consumers by supplying a sufficient
number of modules per month demand drive
supply and if supply isn't met a window
of opportunity emerges for competing
firms to intervene and start producing
on their own those savvy and economics
might raise a point here though and the
perfect model all RAM prices are the
same as long as all RAM itself is the
same so what's the difference between
this assumption and what we're seeing
play out in 2018 about prices being so
high but equal and to that I say it's
from where the prices are derived in the
perfect model supply and demand
determine price not companies supplying
the goods Ram prices jumped nearly 50%
in 2017 we've heard several excuses
including but not limited to R&amp;amp;D and
while this certainly plays a part it
doesn't explain my supply for current
node modules fell with respect to demand
by the end of 2017 and why prices rose
by a disproportionate amount mind you
the same year companies tend to separate
Rd and manufacturing facilities anyway I
mean isn't the revenue from your
manufactured goods supposed to finance
at least part of your research and
development now seriously I want I want
the big
company stands for that question with
the research I've done admittedly not
the most thorough but it's nothing at
the point across these companies are
repeating almost exactly what occurred
in 2006 which not many people are
talking about surprisingly when a 300
million dollar settlement between memory
manufacturers and consumers was reached
Samsung and hynek's in particular pled
guilty and collectively paid over 700
million dollars in criminal fines today
things are looking pretty redundant not
even the Chinese government that's
censorship China for you could turn a
blind eye to the obvious collusion when
several drm manufacturers meet supply
quotas year after year and then suddenly
don't we've got a problem you see if it
was just one company right things would
be much much different maybe they just
had a bad year maybe a manufacturing
facility burned down there always
outliers not only would there be no
price fixing but the company failing to
meet demand would lose out on potential
profits which is not what they want
that's the marginal profit per customer
served so the workaround is this scheme
with competitors to fix prices
regardless of supply and demand trends
in capitalistic markets this is illegal
it infringes upon the consumers rights
to fair and equal opportunity in fact it
strips all buying power from the
consumer so let's extend this analogy to
something a little more hands-on we
would consider cars pretty necessary
right I mean if you can afford one
you're gonna want one and you might not
need cars in all countries so even
developed countries don't need cars but
if you want to keep up and most of them
you got to have a set of wheels same
goes for RAM you might not need a
computer but it certainly helps and your
PC is gonna need around so if you showed
up to a Chevy dealer in search of a
solid 8 cylinder coupe like a Camaro and
they told you that the price of that
model started at 75 thousand dollars
you'd probably get the heck out of there
right a base compared today starts at
2530 K and that is something that you're
gonna keep in mind when you show up to
the dealership and then you find out
that it's just so much more expensive
than it should be the buying power that
consumer retains is his or her ability
to choose based on price and
availability and even if a few
assumptions and our perfect competition
model are broken most buyers have a
pretty good idea of how far their dollar
can go 75 K is just too much for a base
level sports coupe from a company like
Chevrolet not hating on their stuff I
love me some 6.2 liter action but you
know who else is a powerful v8 Ford and
even if I prefer Chevy I'm
probably gonna break brand loyalty
constrains it means saving 30 grand for
a comparable model in comes price-fixing
you show up to the Ford dealer only to
find out that their v8 Coupe starts at
75 k2 but prices for these cars were
like 50% lower just a few months ago and
company after company you find a similar
trend regardless of the base price or
model all cars of shot up 50% in price
notice I said price and not valued there
these are artificial prices they're just
food natural prices are based on supply
and demand curves set intrinsically by
both buyers and sellers but when
companies team up in price fix
especially at higher than normal prices
the consumer loses bargaining power
that's the ability to choose for nearly
a year now consumers in the PC market
have had to deal with these extremely
high RAM prices if you want a computer
and can't find anything that's basically
used or marginally discounted in a
pre-built PC you'll have to absorb
elevated memory prices meaning you'll
have to pay that extra cost it isn't
your fault and there's nothing you can
really do about it and that's what sucks
look folks I'm not one to scream
government intervention anytime I see a
problem with the products price I'm not
that entitled when it comes to the free
market I tend to emphasize the free part
if Chevy alone decides to raise all of
its car prices by 50% I'd say let them
do it they'll sync themselves there are
plenty of alternatives if they were
instead a monopoly which I talk more
about right here with regards to
graphics car prices then we'd have a
problem what Samsung hynek's and micron
have done is create an oligopoly that's
the state of limited competition it's
not illegal in the United States just
look at the cell phone industry but it
opens the door to many shady things
including price collusion
so if 2018 any repeat of 2006 I expect
we'll see a verdict or two at some point
with these class-action lawsuits at
which point prices should begin falling
but this is these court cases take a
long time you know I mean and companies
getting smarter they're finding ways to
collude without leaving data trails and
a firm can't be indicted without data
trail see what I mean so it's a mess RAM
prices or a mess a geeks today cost more
than twice what 16 gigs did two years
ago and it's just it just leaves a foul
taste in the mouth this is the dark side
of big business we're feeling it
firsthand our fates rest in
hands of a few judges juries
whistleblowers and anyone else who can
make a case against these people it's
just a helpless feeling when you want to
build a PC and you find out that one of
the most expensive components today has
to be RAM when it wasn't the case two
years ago I mean that Ram was just
something you had to add on but you
never really thought much about it
because it wasn't too expensive
relatively speaking but now it costs
almost as much as a CPU if you want 16
gigs in most builds and that to me is
just a little ridiculous so I want from
you guys in the comments below if you
liked this video let me know give
someone a thumbs up I appreciate it
thumbs down for the opposite you can
sponsor us with that sponsor button or
you can subscribe to get more on
notifications and videos like these go
live I appreciate that the belt
notification icon by the way that's
something that just makes YouTube a pain
to deal with sometimes but if you want
to click that as well you will get
notified personally when videos like
these go live most of the time again
YouTube is slightly broken right now
this is science to do thanks for
