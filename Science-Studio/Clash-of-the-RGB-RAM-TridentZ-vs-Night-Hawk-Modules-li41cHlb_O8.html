since the inception of this channel
there tried NZ ddr4 utilizes high
quality sampling ICS and their best bin
sub can reach over 4000 megahertz of
course with cast compromises but that's
beside the point more gamers are
concerned with looks than they are with
the performance of their ddr4 partly
because 4000 mega hours of ddr4 isn't
going to change much in the way of frame
rates in most cases and partly because
well a gaming PC becomes furniture in
your house if you build it right KC's
are works of art and our fortresses of
solitude so what if I told you that
another company has done it too taking
subliminal games and RGB if I'd them
this is the new team group Nighthawk RGB
memory module and it's almost every bit
as capable as it's tried NZ counterpart
I'm not sure how to review RAM or
compare Ram in a video but we're gonna
give it a shot in this video
I'd first like to start with the current
champion of our GB RAM and in my book
that is the g.skill trident z module
these are beautifully constructed
extremely well bend and capable of some
serious customization physically they
feel sturdy sleek and premium brushed
aluminum covers both sides of the PCB
though one side is a darker shade than
the other not too bad though keeps
things pretty much monochromatic which
is a big plus in my book especially for
an RGB module no odd coloring to throw
off your custom rig little logos keep
things on the DL as well nothing too
ostentatious which is good as for the
RGB array itself you'll find several
multi color LEDs hidden underneath this
light bar acting as a diffuser to yield
this a beautiful and steady array of
colors well dispersed just looks like
one big light bar with our DB support
g.skill has done a great job here the
diffuser does a great job dispersing
light evenly across all LEDs producing
that solid and uninterrupted strand of
effects even the software is easy to use
it's a bit buggy sure but managing to
pull off RGB customization via the SM
bus is a feat in itself
jeez kill themselves to acknowledge this
and express concerns regarding the
conflicting software running on the bus
supports been pretty solid though from
what I've seen in all current platforms
are supported including X to 99 not so
sure about X 399 yet I'll contact
g.skill if they haven't already made it
public and advise it in the video
description
my only complaints regarding treaded Z
are GB RAM for one the diffuser isn't
super sturdy not that your modules will
be moving anyway but it'd be nice to
have this issue address and fuse your
models it will actually rattle make a
noise if you shake these back and forth
the other complaint and this would not
be review without mentioning this topic
is price now let's transition to the new
kid on the block these DIMMs are
extremely appealing I cannot lie meet
the Nighthawk RGB memory modules from
Team Group respect almost identically to
the Trident Z stuff only 200 megahertz
lower caste voltage and memory size are
all consistent between the two build
material for the Nighthawk is also
aluminium though this time it's sporting
more of a matte finish than a brushed
one I prefer this to be honest most
components in and around your system
will not have a brushed texture I mean
which took the graphics card in this
case there's no brush texture anywhere
else in here the Nighthawk dim is
physically heavier and taller than the
Trident z counterpart as well so it
might feel a bit more
Premium in the hand but it may
experience compatibility issues with
some air coolers because it is a bit
higher just something to keep in mind
these are also RGB illuminated of course
utilizing custom diffusers spanning both
the top and sides of each module the
Triton disease do this to to be fair
though theirs is rather subdued because
it's just one solid diffuser it's not
broken up by the frame itself instead on
the Nighthawks the aluminum frame wraps
around the diffusers on both the top and
sides to break up the LED dispersion
this definitely reduces LED illumination
and instead redirects much of it to the
sides which depends on who you are what
you're going for software support though
is where these modules fall behind the
trade NZ counterpart you see these have
built-in effect you can view rainbow
effects fade and fade out all the good
stuff pretty much everything with the
trends Iran can do the problem is try to
Z RAM utilizes the SM bus which in
itself is rather buggy but at least it's
an option for you and they even have
their own native software to control the
LED effects these modules don't have
that native control what they've done
instead is opted to use Asus or a sync
which you can only use if you have an
asus motherboard so you see what I'm
getting at here this means that users of
gigabyte asrock MSI and Milo Foxconn
motherboards will be stuck with a
default rainbow theme that you're seeing
here not a problem if RGB was your
original scheme anyway but the lack of
customization for most users it's a
serious issue here you buy RGB
components to customise them I don't
even have an Asus board on hand so I
can't even show you what the effects
look like I work with other vendors
right now and none of them obviously
support Asus Ora because none of them
are a sous look I get the team group an
ACS kind of buddied up here team brew
said hey let us use your software and
you know your users have access to our
RAM which looks really cool and it would
be a good way for us to kind of
communicate and work together but the
problem is you're leaving out I would
say 75% of the user base I don't think
that I don't maybe more than 25 30 % of
users out there are using Asus boards at
least Asus boards that support or a sink
that have RGB support on board so this
is a big letdown for me I don't think
that it's like an end-all be-all you
should just buy a tried in Z Ram or some
other RGB module out there I just think
that the opportunity for you to buy
these and be able to customize them is
extremely
limited so either you have an asus board
in which case you're good buy these over
the trendy Ram dims because these are
just more expensive and I don't think
they look as good to be honest or just I
don't know be happy what's the rainbow
effect because that's all you can really
do so my verdict then and I'm going to
be pretty blunt about this I'm not
worried about pissing off either company
here team group does not have their own
proprietary software with which to
control their RGB effects there Ram
that's a big issue for me
g.skill has other peripherals so they
just kind of like you know built off of
that software I presume it all looks
pretty much the same theme wise anyway
so this Ram is just better supported
overall you can tell this is still kind
of in the production phase in fact only
recently did asus officially release
software support for controlling the
effects of these modules if you can find
a lower frequency lower bin kit of
treaded z RGB modules for around 150
bucks 16 gig kit that's not too bad it's
just it's way worse than it used to be
but it's fine it's 16 gigs 450 is okay
in this market then I would say purchase
these all day long because you do get
that support no matter what platform
you're on it's a shame I have to end the
video this way but I can't compare
software which would have been a
deciding factor for me because team
group does not have their own
proprietary software and that to me is a
big problem but if I was going for just
a solid all-around like best looking
them it would still be a team group
nighthawk Ram I think that it looks
better I think that it's just it's got a
bit more flair to it if you just want
RGB I think the g.skill is the way to go
because RGB on the Triton see dims is a
bit more a bit more noticeable it's just
more obvious the entire diffuser spans
the top of the module as always you can
find both of these products linked in
this video's description check them out
let me know in the comments which you
think is the better bang for the buck
despite the drawbacks of each this one
has more drawbacks but still I guess the
price here kind of makes up for that
this is a bit more expensive I don't
know you tell me
also be sure give this video a thumbs up
if you thought it was cool thumbs down
