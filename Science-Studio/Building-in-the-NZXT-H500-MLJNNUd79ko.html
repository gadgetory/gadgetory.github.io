video probably approximately 10 to 15
minutes now him building the piece team
yeah it took him forever five hours it's
not even a customer
what's going on everyone it has been
quite a while since I've reviewed or
built in an NZXT case the last one we
did I believe was the H 700 I I think we
also built in H 200 I and then the s340
elite before that and then the s 349 80s
before T Leigh I thought was a really
great revision of it already great on a
mid tower mid sized ATX tower if you
will and I feel like the H 500 is the
next logical step in the ex 340 lineup
right so obviously it's not keeping the
s name I'm switching over to the H
series from NZXT but it does have a lot
of those s3 fortyish features and that's
why I'm so interested in building in
this one and giving you guys a thorough
overview of the chassis so what we're
gonna do is talk about the cases
features and also building it with these
parts here so we have a III 70 platform
where use asus motherboard and 8700 k
straight power 11 power supply from be
quiet we have a GTX not GTX and r-tx
2060 and then we have a 500 d SSD and
then some other NZXT goodies to make our
case tire build look rather pretty
so starting first with a few of those
cases features again very similar to the
s340 elite I'm going to put the glass
panel on so you can see how easy that is
to install I really like what NZXT is
done here all you have to do is slide
the panel into kind of a basement roof
if you will there's a part of this that
sticks out just a little bit it's a
perfect lip for this glass panel to
slide in and then all you gotta do is
press it against the chassis it clicks
into place and then you have one thumb
screw up here it's captive so it doesn't
leave I need to screw everything into
place like so a very simple installation
only one screw again and it's a thumb
screw so you really don't need a tool
other than your fingers so again this
tempered glass panel doesn't go all the
way down you do have the basement
protruding so it does comprise part of
the left side panel but I want to talk
next about the inside we have these
again these are modular SSD trays
that's a nice addition unless you'd be
flexible with where you want to put
these you just snap them into place move
them wherever you want or just take them
out outright if you're not feeling the
basement mounted SSD thing we'd also
have a dedicated VGA supplemental power
cable cut out here which is great for
running cables to the graphics card you
don't have to worry about stuffing them
further back in the case just having the
cables hanging across the entire GPU
shroud really doesn't look at all that
appealing so this cutout is nice to see
we also have the famous or infamous
depend on how you look at it cable
shroud and this cable bar is actually a
good touch in this case it's not
overwhelming like it was in the H 700 I
and I'm glad that they kept it kind of
subtle the same way to the s340 had this
it actually kind of extends over the
basement as well but again it's it's
very secluded it's pressed basically
against the roof of the basement so it's
not going to get in the way there's
space upfront for up to a 280 millimeter
fan radiator combo which is great there
is no way to extend that further down
those so only up to a 280 you will not
have 360 ml rat or fan support at the
front top of the case is pretty
straightforward just 2 USB 3 ports
actually some detail here that NZXT hit
on was the purple accents it looks like
purple mice on colorblind
USB 3 ports that's kind of cool purple
as NZXT color you guys don't know that
already
we have headphone jack microphone jack
a hard driver just a drive LED indicator
and also a power button with an LED ring
around it it's pretty much it for the
first half of the case I don't recommend
placing a radiator up here it's gonna be
pretty tight might conflicting some
motherboards that especially beefy heat
sinks other than that though
pretty much bare you're not gonna have
to 80 ml or 240 mil fan rad support up
top mainly because of the cable bar so
that's a trade off with a lot of NZXT
cases it's not gonna hurt too much
though unless you're really going for
like an all-out custom water-cooled
build you probably want a different case
in this one anyway no one to the right
side of the case it's kind of a mixture
blend if you will of the H 700 I or the
H I series and the S 340 elite so you do
have these cable channels here which
you're good for routing things like your
USB 3.0 some fan cables not the best
though for the 24 pin these channels are
kind of small for a lot of those cables
and if you have custom extensions or
just full-on custom cables it's it's
really gonna be tough to get all these
to fit in here so you might just want to
stick to using the cable bar for that
route and then using these for the
smaller cables like the fan cables and
USB 3 or 2 right side panel installation
is a little unorthodox but it's actually
pretty cool how they've done this so a
lot of those you know cheaper cases you
have to slide the panel on from the back
that can be difficult to do when you
have a lot of cables back here so when
in 60 is done instead if it included
little notches toward the front and
basically the entire panel acts like a
door kinda like it's hinged and all it
does is swing into place from the rear
use the two captive thumb screws to
secure it and you are good to go so it's
not gonna simplify the process by any
means at least when it comes to the time
it takes but it will make kind of
pushing all those cables against the
rear of the motherboard tray a lot
easier by nature of its design last few
things we'll touch on we have the hard
drive cage it supports two hard drives
it can be slipped further toward the
back so depending on how much space you
have how big your power supply is this
is pretty flexible and you can slide it
on the bottom it's just screw it into
place with four Phillips screws and then
the power supply side does have a dust
filter that is removable from the back
that's
again pretty straightforward fairly
conventional I do want to swing the back
just for a second so you guys can see
this is a seven PCIe slot case so it's
by definition of mid-tower I know no
dedicated bracket which means you're
gonna install the power supply from the
right side that's okay I know the
bracket was a nice touch and I you load
things in from the back but it means
that you don't have to fund your cables
through here as well which was an issue
with the cases with dedicated brackets
so I don't mind missing that but you do
have the mounting points again like most
cases do you have a PCIe bracket shield
or they want to call this a lot of the
more expensive cases have this so it's
nice to see in the age 500 and then we
have two 120mm fans I'm not going to
talk too much about these were actually
gonna swap these out they're not they're
not very great they do get kind of loud
and they don't have pwm support so NZXT
is just saying hey if you don't want to
spend extra money we got two cheaper
fans in here
but obviously if you want something
that's quieter that's gonna have PW
support you're gonna want to swap these
out definitely now be H 500 does have a
dedicated standoff to kind of guide the
motherboard into place so you don't need
to put a screw here you just need to
line this up with the hole on the
motherboard and you'll be ready to go
also something that I'm really glad NZXT
included work these zip ties these are
really nice if you want to be very
particular about your cable management
at the rear then you're gonna want a lot
of these and NZXT includes a lot of
these so good on NZXT for this I really
like this we have HD audio we have a USB
3 cable and we have front panel oh wow
ok so this is cool so this cable is I'm
not sure what it's including it looks
like it's including the power LED cable
set also a power switch and the hard
drive LED cable set all-in-one header
check that out that's super cool so that
means we don't have to worry about the
nitpicking the very fine wiring with
those small little cables Wow
look at that I've never installed front
panel cables any easier than what I did
just there I hope more case
manufacturers do this now usually you
want to install the CPU cooler before
you actually get them
or in the case but we got a big cut out
here at the back of the H 500 just gonna
slide this in and we can install the
rest by laying down the case another
thing I just noticed there's a super
large cable cutout hole here for routing
any cable that you want to be wrapped
around the back of the motherboard from
the top which is really convenient
there's not just like a small hole here
so to remove and install this fan
bracket upfront it's pretty
straightforward similar to how you would
deal with a top mounted bracket you just
have to get it into position and then
captive thumb screws again
I love captive thumb screws you can
secure it like so and again you have to
do this because you can't remove that
front panel it's completely bolted down
to the rest of the chassis so you have
to have that bracket there in Zechs you
thought of that that's good and we have
those two 120s up front now you know
honestly I can't believe in zxt trusted
me with another huge product after the
last time I basically blew up two power
supplies thinking that the U plus was at
fault definitely wasn't not whoa this is
magnetic that's really cool you could
mount it anywhere yeah I'm just gonna
put my q2 right there it's all good or
I'm gonna put on the outside on my case
just like that or really anywhere all
right I'm a little too intrigued by
something this simple Hey Ya pizza place
thank you
all right now just finishing up cable
management here on the right side I want
you guys to see you really took your
time up here you can make this look
several types especially toward the
front definitely glad that we have this
much space between the PSU and the hard
drive cage I kind of just stuffed all
the extra cables underneath here and it
kind of looks oh I think it looks decent
considering I'm not like you know
picking out cables that are you know a
certain size so with any remaining
cables you just have to kind of figure
out where they go let's do the right
side panel test we just squeeze it on
like so piece of cake that hinge
definitely helps yeah I could tell this
would have been a bit more difficult if
we had to just slide it toward the front
in a conventional case and there we go
everything is all tucked in it's a very
nice install I like that idea
plaid NZXT one with that for this case
now the last thing we need to do I'll
show you guys the front here is install
the graphics card so I have the
Supplemental VGA cable hanging out here
it's just a single 8 pin and I have the
hew two here as well as the solid-state
drive everything else is in place I
believe so let's get the graphics card
installed okay I'm good to go there and
let's connect this actually just ring
enough there is not a connection on this
side we actually have it back there
we've definitely got some slack so plug
that in see if we can stuff the rest of
this cable in we're not using custom
cables so I'm trying my best here to
make do with the stock cable kit but
they are black sleeve so that helps with
this scheme I know if you notice we
haven't installed Ram yet and that's
because I'm not sure what kit we're
gonna use the only we could go with
something just bare-bones
black but I think this needs to be a
little more over the top this is a
thirty six hundred megahertz kit and 32
gigabytes in total overkill for most
gamers
gonna fill up all four slots more of an
aesthetic thing at this point so I think
it looks pretty clean this cable here is
kind of pissing me off but there's
really nothing we can do about it
let's just just kind of hang in there I
think a second car would look really
nice it'd fill up that extra space but
anyway
all right let's power this thing on and
see see what it looks like there you go
ease of installation it's a lot better
than the fourth um screws on the corners
let's cross the fingers hey the only
thing is we can't change the the g-force
color so I think we're just gonna have
to go with a white and green color
scheme which that's fine I'm not upset
with that yeah ethically everything
looks good in the build another thing I
really like about this case is the fact
that the tempered glass panel is pretty
much like a hundred percent transparent
there's no tint to it and that's a pet
peeve of mine when you have a really
dark tinted glass panel you can't really
see the components inside just the LEDs
so in this case you can really see all
the components especially with an RGB
strip in there and RGB fans so let's get
the colors coordinated and then we'll
take a few more b-roll shots and we'll
conclude the video so just so you guys
you know you see a video probably
approximately ten to fifteen minutes now
him building the piece team yeah it took
him forever five hours it's not even a
custom dude okay so everything is up and
running I've already installed Windows
10 install all the drivers
I even installed cam because I wanted to
use the u2 and control the crow rig h7
quadroon me also wanted to control the
RGB strips I can do that up front but
now that I bring the PC over here I
can't even open the software I
double-click the icon nothing happens
it's not running and task manager even
if I go into the the root file folder
and try to open it that way nothing it's
not to reinstall cam it's not the most
mature software in that sense so they
struggle with cam is real but the
struggle with the aged 500 is
non-existent this is actually a very
easy case of Billa to build then I am
very impressed
with the overall quality of the case and
I looked up the price around 70 bucks
it's a really good deal for this I would
say this is probably the best case in
its category so for that I've built in
so that's my take on it I hope you guys
enjoyed this like I don't know it's a
different type of video and I just
wanted to be a little different this
time and give you guys a different
perspective I wanted to build in at
firsthand and tell you how I just fared
I guess there in the process so if you
want to see something like this in the
future let me know in the comments below
I'll appreciate all the feedback that
you guys give negative or positive I'll
be sure to check it all out because
we're gonna get serious about case
reviews in 2019 setting up a few
contracts are gonna try to be very
consistent with how we do things I did
not address air flow and that's because
I'm saving that for a separate video
although there are a few other tech
tubers have already covered the air flow
properties of this case it's not the
worst it's not the best but it'll do for
a $70 case that's how I see it
so you guys like this case like the
video let me know biggest when it comes
up I appreciate thumbs down for the
opposite or if you hate everything about
life getting click the red subscribe
button haven't already and I'll catch
you in the next one this is science
