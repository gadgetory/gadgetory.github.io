upload an overclocking guide so I don't
know specifically what CPUs you wanted
me to overclock but I do have two builds
completely assembled and on hand
currently one of them is right there
that's the 4690k build from a few videos
ago and the other ones in my office and
we're just going to use that one because
it's already plugged in I don't feel
like moving things around so 6600 K it
is we're gonna overclock the 6600 K to
as high as we possibly can with a Kraken
x31 cooler from NZXT let's see how high
things go before sparks fly now I'm just
kidding we're not gonna go that far but
we're going to go as high as the cpu
will allow us while maintaining adequate
temperatures in this case I'll say
anything under ADC is acceptable and
without going above like a crazy Veeck
or maybe like 1.45 no no no we'll find
out so very quickly a disclaimer on the
overclocking guy that you're about to
see
remember the overclocking your CPU can
pretty much avoid any warranty you have
even if it's a KC PU so if you overclock
your cpu too much and I don't know you
throw too much voltage at it something
that you shouldn't be doing and you end
up damaging your CPU or your motherboard
or your graphics card or anything else
that's connected directly to your
processor those things aren't going to
be covered by any warranty because you
pretty much voided it yourself when you
decided to throw one point nine volts of
V core at your CPU so keep those things
in mind I have to say that up front
because I could yeah I'm not liable for
any of that stuff but I don't even want
people to assume the fact that I am
liable because I'm not don't do anything
weird to your processor yo okay so a
quick quick explanation of overclocking
all we're going to be doing in this
video is tampering with two separate
things
okay a one is the multiplier and what is
the vcore you can't have one without the
other you can't have super-high
multiplier which is basically a number
times your base clock frequency which is
typically a hundred megahertz so in our
case 46 times 100 megahertz is 4.6
gigahertz which is what our i5 6600 K is
currently at and if I decided to
increase that multiplier to 48 48 times
100 is 4.8 gigahertz
so that's how the multiplier works just
a number that is multiplied by your base
clock frequency and that gives you your
CPU frequency overall but the other side
of this equation is the V Corps and the
V Corps is the amount of voltage that is
supplied directly to the processor
not enough voltage and your CPU won't
even turn on it's a bit like not having
gasoline in a car if you catch my drift
but having too much voltage can result
in an extremely hot processor and
probably a processor with an extremely
short life span so that's why I said
what I said up front in the disclaimer
these kinds of things can reduce the
longevity of your processor and just may
cause your system to altogether just
poop out on you so things things get
pretty risky when it comes to
overclocking if you don't know what
you're doing that's why I'm going to
make this video this hopefully should
alleviate some of your concerns so let's
get right to it so the first thing we're
going to do is shut down our computer
let it down we're going to restart it
and we're going to click delete in our
case maybe it's f2 for you maybe it's
something like f12 I don't know it's
going to be the button that forces your
computer into it the BIOS refer to your
motherboards manual if you don't know
what button that is okay we're going to
go right here to overclock and then
alright so remember I was talking about
with your multiplier and your V core
well this right here is our multiplier
so this number times a base clock
frequency of 100 yields the gigahertz
part of the frequency of your CPU so in
our case 4.6 gigahertz 46 times 100 the
other factor in this particular
overclocking guide will be the core
voltage this is your V core may not
always be called the core it may be
called core voltage or something else
just make sure that you know which one
you're tampering with make sure that
you're confident this one is the vcore
but obviously if I plan on going any
higher than 46 on my multiplier I'm
going to need more voltage in fact if I
just left this excuse me if I just left
my voltage at 1.32 and turn this to say
48 my computer would crash instantly it
wouldn't even boot in the operating
system but we're going to go ahead and
try 48 so 4.8 gigahertz and we're going
to set our V core let's say one point
isn't going to be tough here one point
three eight two one point three eight
and okay so we have booted successfully
into our OS we are currently at four
point eight gigahertz and I will confirm
that with little hardware monitor right
here go ahead and zoom in the middle
sorry this is so unprofessional ish I
have one camera and one screen and one
one body so kind of when I'm stuck out
right now so we're at four point eight
gigahertz that's what it's showing right
here and our temperatures are looking
phenomenal at least at idle now we're
going to give our CPU a little stress
test I always like to do this because
this will confirm if our CPU is actually
stable now you could use something like
i-264
or even prime95 if you're hardcore
but Cinebench will do just fine for
right now so we're going to run this
test and we're going to observe our CPU
temperatures at the same time and now
this is very difficult for you guys to
see because this is so far zoomed out I
don't want to run the screen recorder
because well that's going to make things
a bit worse okay folks so we have our
CPU usage right here so you want to keep
track of that these will all jump up to
100 when I finally runs to the bench and
then these are our temperatures
currently all around 20 C set for the
package which is closer to 30 C those
are still very good idle temperatures
keep in mind we're only cooling this
with a cracking x31 so this is a single
spyware no this is only being cold with
an X 31 cracking from NZXT it's only a
120 millimeter radiator and we're still
getting these very low temperatures at
idle with a 4.8 gigahertz overclock so
let's go and run set a benchmark 15 and
let's cross our fingers and hope that
our computer does not crash in the
process oh it did okay so that is what
it looks like when you when you don't
have enough voltage that is what happens
it may say something like watchdogs it
may see something else kind of weird but
for the most part if you are
overclocking you need a blue screen of
death randomly at any point when your
CPU is under quite a bit of stress that
is likely what is going on you do not
have enough voltage being supplied to
your processor so it's actually not very
difficult to
to fix all we got to do is just increase
our vcore so go back into overclock and
I don't know why that's read maybe
saying that's too high I don't know why
the effective is lower that's a little
strange
let's do one point for getting pretty
high all right folks this is getting a
little uncomfortable now
okay now we're into operating system
should be more stable than it was in the
previous run just because we do have
more voltage being supplied but at the
same time our temperatures could be
quite a bit higher these things tend to
exponentially increase once you pass a
certain threshold I think we're right on
the verge of doing that with this
processor attempts are still pretty good
we're still mid mid 20s on most of our
cores and still right under 30 C for our
package nope gonna crash yeah it froze
here comes the blue screen everyone
blue screen there it is there it is
clock watchdog timeout
so our CPU still does not having a
voltage to operate at 4.8 gigahertz you
guys see how intense this is this is
this is we've hit a wall here 4.8
gigahertz is just that's just too high
for most of these processors let's see
what we can do here
msi is telling us oh you're in red 1.4
is just too high
well I don't care let's try 1.4 to like
I said 1.45 is as high as I'm going so
that is it and yep telling that's 1.4
1.4 to go ahead and reset check our
temperatures once again things are
definitely a bit higher so our idols are
just under 30 see our package every now
and then is jumping up about 40 see yeah
so we're still pretty good considering
the amount of voltage we are currently
supplying to the processor actually not
bad this thing has a very high heat
tolerance on it looks good
temperatures are still under 50 C under
full load
but can it pass the whole test that is
the question
and we are at 777 C CD C I said CP I
have been saying CP in the past couple
videos CB is where I meant so we're at
777 CV currently and our max temperature
and all of our cours things never got
above 51 C and our package also never
got above 51 C that is very very
impressive
I am very impressed with this processor
and this cooler we we got very lucky
very lucky with this chip here so I'm
going to save that score because that's
a pretty darn good score and we're going
to run one more test we're going to run
Geekbench
because heat bench isn't going to
absolutely murder our CPU but it's gonna
put it under some stress as well likely
as much as some of our gains we'll all
right we finished a geek bench in 50
seconds flat and our single core score
is 4896 that is pretty awesome that's a
very high single core score in our
multi-core score is fifteen thousand six
eighty six which is up there with the
lower end i 7s so not bad at all that's
a that's a very good score that is a
very good score but our single core
score I think is even more noteworthy
that's that's almost 5000 I don't think
there's a single processor that's sold
to consumers at this point it gets
anywhere near that so 4896 is very good
very very good for our little I 560 600
K here I'm gonna go to one point four
five whoa there we go yeah one point
four five volts that's freakin high guys
that's really high
boy mmm-hmm and we're just gonna go 249
first yeah okay okay I don't know ah V
chord a for one point four five and
multiplier 449 okay yeah here we go I
would be surprised that this even booted
for point nine is super super high
that's that's very high for a 120
millimeter radiator and at 6600 K
sure all right it looks like we're gonna
get a crash because uh yeah we're
definitely gonna get a crash yep there
we go blue screen guys that's about it
I'm not going any higher than that
I don't feel comfortable pushing this to
1.5 volts it's definitely not rated to
receive that much of a voltage increase
I'm not going to go that high I'm going
to keep it for the sake of I don't know
if just being a good role model I'm
going to keep it at 4.8 gigahertz but I
am going to up the voltage just a bit so
we're going to go to 48 yep and I'm
going to keep the vcore will do 1.44 and
that's where it's going to stay guys I
think that 1.44 is it's going to be just
fine and our temperatures are relatively
low so even if it's not as low as it
could be 1.44 should be just fine so
there you have it folks 4.8 gigahertz
for the V core of 1.4 if 3 will say it
was stable ish at 1.4 - but I have a
feeling that it would probably blue
screen on me if I decided to run prime95
or a 264 or even game very intensely so
1.4 3 is where I'm going to keep it at I
will keep you updated if I have to raise
that voltage any higher but for now
we'll say that one point 4 3 is pretty
stable let me know what you're sporting
in your rig if you currently have an
overclocked CPU be sure to list that
CPUs name frequency V core and
corresponding cooler in the comments
below we'd all be very curious to know
what you're currently sporting and what
you're currently sporting it AK
you know frequency wise see I'd do that
for us and then I'll be sure to LIKE the
video if you liked it dislike it if you
disliked it I know this was a little
less professional than what the video
content usually is on this channel but
that's the process that I go through
when I overclock and I wanted to show
you guys it's really that simple all I
do is mess with the volt the multiplier
and the vcore that's really it there are
other things you could change like your
PCI line frequencies and things like
that but I don't mess with any of that
this process here is very simple anybody
with the proper hardware can do it this
is science studio thanks for learning
