revolutionary in PC case design and a
thermaltake view 37 is no exception
you're looking at a full tower with
eight PCIe slots plenty of space at the
rear for cable managing and a very
unique side window that's not the first
time that they've done something like
this with acrylic that's what this is by
the way not tempered glass that would
make this case much more expensive than
it is but it is implemented very well in
this chassis I'll tell you upfront that
this isn't my favorite case by any means
but I certainly like the direction
thermal takes taking here let's start
with the exterior and work our way in
this chassis screams Thermaltake with
its many transparent panels steel and
plastic mixture of the frame and RGB
accents included with the RGB model of
the vu 37 though which is the one you're
looking at here are three ring plus one
40 millimeter fans with 12 addressable
LEDs along with an analog controller and
sync function to be used in conjunction
with various asus gigabyte and msi
motherboards I explain this in more
detail in my CES coverage right here but
in a nutshell this box and its
corresponding software allow for full
RGB syncing with various vendor hardware
also included with the case is this PCIe
switch board of sorts it does not
connect to the motherboard in any way
instead it connects to the box which is
going to be more than likely on the
right side of the case so instead of
having to remove your right panel in
order to change the color scheme or the
fan RPMs you can control all of that
with this switch board here all in all
it's a very cool concept on paper and
I'm glad to see that they're able to
work with MSI gigabyte and asus here to
get their hardware syncing up all in one
software package which is really nice
you don't have to have four or five
different icons on your desktop that
control different things you can control
all of it with one single software
package and that's what Thermaltake
seeking to do make that much simpler so
I like where they're going with that now
let's talk about some things that I
don't like about the case
now while Thermaltake have definitely
focused on accentuating the color
coordination in the view 37 they've had
to certainly compromise in places that I
would not have personally compromised I
want to state though at this point if
you're wondering this panel here is not
tempered glass
I think it's paraphrased a bit earlier
this is actually acrylic and they've
thickened the acrylic to make it
look like tempered glass I actually
thought it was at first I must confess I
didn't know anything about this case
except for what I had seen briefly at
CES but they had a few tempered glass
panels like this too on other cases so I
wasn't sure which one it was
it is acrylic it will scratch it just
like any other acrylic despite it being
slightly thicker than most acrylic
panels and some of the older cases and
the cheaper models out there right now
so something to keep in mind this is why
the case is not you know 250 bucks it's
around 160 170 USD if you want the RGB
model if you don't want the RGB model
you're looking at around 110 bucks which
i think is fair for a full tower you're
gonna pay a bit more for that anyway
just because you're gonna have that
extra hardware support the front panel
is tinted significantly more so than the
side panel which is fine all you can see
through the front in most cases anyway
is the fan array and since these are RGB
the tint provides a special kind of
subdued character to the otherwise bulky
chassis and while we're here front i/o
spans the top portion of his face
consisting of the usual two USB 3.0
ports two 2.0 ports mic and headphone
jacks and dedicated power and reset
switches ok now i've prolonged to the
inevitable the negatives of this case i
am disappointed in the lack of a power
supply basement especially seeing as
though this is a really big curved
acrylic panel that spans the entire
height of the case i understand why
thermaltake went this route making room
for water cooling enthusiasts and larger
radiator configs but even a half or
segmented basement in my book is better
than no basement it just looks too bare
and months is 2018 something else I have
to mention in 2018 is air flow and this
case is not optimized for it I don't
even need to run tests to tell you that
this thing is gonna have a tough time
pulling in air you have just very fine
grill slits on the left and right side
and those are really the only access
points for air flow the acrylic front
panel the slightly tinted panel up front
that I was just talking about spans the
entire height of the case up front so no
air will pass through there and anytime
air has to make a 90-degree turn to be
pulled in through fans which are already
pushed between the chassis and that
front panel you're not gonna really have
a good time in terms of air flow this is
we're talking maybe 2 centimeters worth
of clearance between the front of the
fan they put to bring fans up front but
I went ahead and moved all three to the
front just because it looks a bit more
uniform all three of these are gonna
have a difficult
pulling an air period because they are
so close to this front acrylic panel I
really wonder what Thermaltake was
thinking here they probably already
decided way in advance that this case
wasn't gonna be very well airflow
optimized and that's fine I mean that's
what you're going for okay people are
probably gonna compromise on that anyway
for a case it looks like this and hey
look up top you're also compromising on
a radiator and fan compatibility because
you have no mounting points up top this
is just one solid piece of acrylic that
spans the left side panel and the top
panel and yeah you can't pull air
through an acrylic panel right so they
didn't put anything up top it's purely
aesthetic and that's what I think this
entire case was going for was just like
that wow factor other purely aesthetic
things the V 37 opts for include a
vertical graphics card mounting support
so you don't get a riser cable which I
think defeats the purpose of even having
that option there but you can buy one
separately they're pretty expensive but
I found that Thermaltake riser cables
are among the best out there they're
very consistent I had Jack send me three
of them and all three worked beautifully
I saw literally no degradation in
graphics card performance so if you want
to pay that extra premium that's fine
you can do what I've done here with the
gtx 1070 mounted sideways but it is
awfully close to that left side panel so
you might be suffocating a graphics card
just a bit more than you would otherwise
have you had mounted it horizontally but
okay enough with the negatives I think
that I've pretty much gotten most of
them out of the way anyway most people
are gonna prioritize airflow so that's
gonna be a pretty big negative and then
the fact that this is acrylic so it
scratches this is acrylic so it
scratches nothing really premium about
the case in that sense that could also
be taken as a negative but hey it keeps
the cost down I want to focus now on
something that the view 37 does very
well and that is cable managed
particularly behind the motherboard tray
this right section is immense so big in
fact that you can fit up to four three
and a half inch hard drives here I'm
seriously talking about hard drives
right behind the motherboard tray the
thickness is plenty for even the most
extensive of cable routing a format
other manufacturers should follow an
extra few centimeters back here goes a
long way I'm looking at you specifically
Corsair the building experience is just
as crucial in my book as the end result
and the view 37 capitalizes on its many
rubber grounding cutouts as well keeping
things concealed and clean for viewing
through the curved acrylic on the left
so my building experience was a great
one
thanks to that space offered by the
right-side about an inch and a half of
clearance there is more than enough I
would say an inch is gonna be optimal if
you have more than that it's just gravy
and I really took advantage of it if you
have extra cable links maybe cable
extensions you're not gonna have a
problem at all fitting those into the
view 37 one bit like most thermal take
cases this one has ample space for water
cooling gear in particular you can put a
reservoir up front easily no problem you
don't have again mounting support up top
you can put a radiator up front you can
also put a radiator along the right side
panel there is actually space for air to
pass through that panel so it's kind of
funny to say this but you might actually
have better air flow moving through that
right panel than you do up front which
is a little weird so if you wanted like
an intake system you could do that but
it would look weird having a radiator
there without fans being on you know the
left side right so I don't know how
you'd want to do that but you have the
the option there to mount three up to
three fans three 140mm fans along that
right panel also 300 140 up front along
with their radiator counterparts and
then either a 120 or 140 fan radiator
config at the rear that is pretty much
it with the front panel and the rear
panel can the top panel can't put
anything but you also have space down
below if you want to put one or two
intake fans below that is certainly an
option as well
so those are my thoughts on the view 37
I expected a bit more just from like the
hardware side I think that the acrylic
is just it's one of those things that
you understand why it's there and I get
it because of the price of like a curved
tempered glass panel would bring this
thing in a 200 250 dollar territory I
get that but if you're if you're trying
to promote this case is like an
aesthetically pleasing case but you know
in the back of your head that you have
only acrylic for the front and the side
like if they had put you know timber
glass up the front and then acrylic on
the side I would have understood that
just a bit more but you have acrylic
upfront which is a cost-saving measure
and on top of that it's tinted and then
you also have that left panel which is
acrylic which is already scratched to
hell I think it's it's really bad right
here I don't even know how I did that
but that's how a critic is for you I I
just I know that it's not a very premium
case in that sense because it's not
using glass and that's just how it is in
2018 right if a case has tempered glass
it's gonna feel a bit more premium then
it's acrylic counterpart so it's hard to
dock the view thirty-seven for that but
I kind
have to because of the situation they
put themselves in particularly with this
curved panel which I don't think is
necessary it looks cool but from a
practical standpoint it eliminates a lot
of support especially for custom cooling
enthusiasts who want to put something up
top like a radiator or even just a few
fans so is this case sexy oh yes I give
the sexy factor a 10 out of 10
is it functional maybe 7 out of 10
because it's missing that top you know
the top support right for rads and fans
and it's got acrylic which means it's
gonna scratch a lot and then is it
premium this one's difficult to gauge
because premium is more or less in the
eye of the beholder in my opinion I
don't think it's very premium I really
don't because I know that it has acrylic
front and side panels and it just I mean
there are just things about this case
that weren't thought through all the way
or that don't line up perfectly that
bothered me to an extent if you're OCD
you'll agree with me
for instance the curve of the acrylic
doesn't line up flush with the curve of
the chassis there was actually a pretty
big gap at the rear of mine and I think
that's what bothered Thermaltake too
since I decided to cover it up with a
piece of plastic held on by four screws
a bit of a cheesy cover up here I mean
you can see it right when you take it
off you have to take this off you want
to remove the entire acrylic panel but
it's just something that they really
didn't see all the way through and it
shows the the quality right the
workmanship that went into this case
wasn't top-notch so knowing these things
again at the back of my head bothers me
and that's why I'm not gonna say that
it's a premium case at 160 or 170 USD
that's asking you a bit much the non RGB
model is much more reasonable in my book
closer to a hundred bucks I think
thermal takes charging a bit too much
for the control software and the the
little control box that you're gonna get
with the ring fans to be able to sync
everything up color wise I think that's
too much of a premium this price might
shy people away knowing that there are
compromises in the chassis itself with
that if you appreciate the review or the
opinions presented let me know that
giving someone a thumbs up I appreciate
it if you disagree with me in any sort
of way I want you to disagree with me
openly and publicly in the comments
below I don't know what you think I got
wrong about this case or what you see in
this case that I don't maybe see after
building in it I feel pretty confident
with my opinions but you might change on
mine and I might have to come back in
the comments section later and pick
something you know you never know people
bring things your attention that you
don't see right away and I
when you guys do that for me because it
allows me to kind of just come out take
in multiple perspectives not just my own
