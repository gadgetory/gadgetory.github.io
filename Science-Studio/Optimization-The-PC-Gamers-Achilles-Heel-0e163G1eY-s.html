most popular and debated topics wrote in
console and personal computer gaming I
mean come on there's thousands of those
arguments out there this was done for
two reasons and they're gonna hurt to
here so brace yourselves firstly it
consoles were looking pretty hot right
now in light of inflated graphics card
pricing it sucks to say but in my
opinion it's true
seems as though I've been mentioning
this in every video lately but I believe
this point to be true many distinct
cards cost twice as much as entire
consoles ps4 pro's and Xbox one X's just
a fact cryptocurrency mining has
essentially priced us out of our own
market so many are jumping ship at least
for now hopefully they come back later
second it's no secret that console
exclusives and even ports are generally
better optimized in their PC
counterparts this is due to several
factors which we'll discuss shortly but
I found that this argument in particular
is a weapon of choice for many console
fanboys so what exactly is the reason
for this we'll discuss various examples
and reasons for this in today's a minute
science episode
be quiet dark bass 700 brings luxury and
silence to the mainstream luxury thanks
to subtle RGB integration full case
modularity and even USB type-c support
in silence thanks to 3 included silent
wings 3 fans and sound damping foam all
around click the link in this video's
description for more details scrolling
through steams hardware and software
surveys for 2018 I found some
interesting results
the most common graphics card used by
far as a gtx 1060 followed closely by
the maxwell gen gtx 960 then the 750 Ti
and the 1050 Ti now I kept scrolling and
realized that the first AMD graphics
card didn't show up until AMD Radeon r7
graphics that's pretty vague so it could
be mobile graphics or a full-on discrete
card according to this theme survey only
0.62 percent of users gamed with one
that's surprisingly low now these are
merely surveys requiring consent so take
them with a grain of salt but this trend
sheds a bit of light on the first cause
for lackluster PC game optimization
everyone's forwarding something
different that's kind of the joy of
being on the side of PCs right you can
customize things the way you want rather
than design a game around one or two
platforms though and specifications
computer programmers must ensure that
their games meet the demands of a
plethora of various hardware
configurations and on top of that they
can't control when new hardware hits the
market so future updates are almost
always required to maintain that optimal
gaming experience this reason is linked
to another in a sort of cause-and-effect
relationship imagine designing a puzzle
piece to fit in various positions no
matter what you'll have a few gaps
because not all those holes are the same
so it's a compromise involved with
serving multiple parties these gaps
indicate inefficiencies resulting from
hardware utilization in my video how to
identify a CPU or GPU bottleneck which
you can check out right here by the way
I discuss how various Hardware usages
can impact frame rates for example city
skylines failed to utilize my second
graphics card which indicated that this
game lacked SLI optimization it still
does by the way so dual graphics card
support is a different animal entirely
but it proves my point
not all games run perfectly on all
machines and in theory any game that
doesn't fully utilize your hardware
which you can identify with a program
like MSI Afterburner
is quote on
apart from these however there is one
additional reason why games tend to play
worse as a whole on PC early access and
premature launches I want to use pub G
as an example here because it's by far
the most popular as of January 2018 and
is still terribly unoptimized and no
matter what anyone says it's it's not a
well optimized game period peak player
usage does spike though around 2.5
million players which is an impressive
feat for any game let alone one that
consistently crashes don't get me wrong
I love this game I play it all the time
it's very addicting and fun to play with
friends especially but it needs serious
work which is why it's constantly down
for maintenance but ignoring the game
stability pub G also faces many hardware
utilization issues especially on AMD
side for example my Rison 7 1700 X only
average 31 % CPU utilization during the
entire course of one round of gameplay
by contrast the i7 8700 K averaged just
over 50% the frame rates aside we're
seeing a huge disparity between Intel
and AMD utilization doesn't just stop
with Rison 7 by the way the Rison 5 1600
acts at 4 gigahertz was utilized roughly
20 percent less than the 8700 K with
identical Ram frequency and core count
the red team is vastly underutilized
here and that's a big sign of not only
game bias but game optimization issues
now this may have turned into an
apparent pub G bash fest at the end of
this video but I bring up these points
to prove another point PC gaming will
always incur a higher performance
variance pre-releases multi-platform
support and hardware utilization play
substantial roles here we simply can't
expect them all to work perfectly on
every platform at all times and that is
why optimization will always be the
Achilles heel of the PC a gamer if you
have a comment or suggestion for a
future topic in the minute science
playlist or elsewhere be sure to let me
know by leaving a comment down below I
checked them out especially in the first
hour so the videos publishing but I'll
come back later and see what was very
popular in the comments section and
address those topics more than likely in
future videos if you like this video in
particular let me know by giving this
one a thumbs up I appreciate that comes
