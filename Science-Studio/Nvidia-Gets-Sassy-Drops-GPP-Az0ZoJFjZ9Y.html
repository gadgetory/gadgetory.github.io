article for the first time my jaw
continued to drop lower and lower the
further I read down the page Geron
people wrote this apparently he doesn't
have a job anymore because he was the
marketing director I guess of the
GeForce Partner Program and the news
today it no longer exists somes gonna
read the whole thing to you it's not
very long you want to read it yourself
you can do so via the link below but
this is this is pretty juicy I'm gonna
read this just as is and then I'm gonna
translate for you what John actually
means here he says a lot has been said
recently about our GeForce Partner
Program the rumors conjecture and
mistruths go far beyond its intent
rather than battling misinformation we
have decided to cancel the program GPP
had a simple goal ensuring that gamers
know what they are buying and can make a
clear choice Nvidia creates cutting edge
technologies for gamers we have
dedicated our lives to it we do our work
at a crazy intense level investing
billions to invent the future and ensure
that amazing Nvidia tech keeps coming we
do this work because we know gamers love
it and appreciate it
gamers want the best GPU tech GPP was
about making sure gamers who want Nvidia
tech get Nvidia tech with GPP we asked
our partners to brand to their products
in a way that would be crystal clear the
choice of GPU greatly defines a gaming
platform so the GPU brand should be
clearly transparent though substitute
GPUs hidden behind a pile of techno
jargon most partners agreed they owned
their brands a GPP didn't change that
they decide how they want to convey
their product promise to gamers still
today we are pulling the plug on GPB to
avoid any distraction from the super
exciting work we're doing to bring
amazing advances to PC gaming this is a
great time to be a geforce partner and
be part of the fastest growing gaming
platform in the world the GeForce gaming
platform is rich with the most advanced
technology and with GeForce experience
it is the way it's meant to be played so
most of the juicy stuff is further up
the article I'm gonna start with the
second sentence the rumor is conjecture
and mistruths go far beyond its intent I
disagree with this because I don't think
I don't think that many tech channels
out there were purposefully trying to
misconstrue and spread lies the problem
Nvidia is that you weren't explicit
about what GPP actually was
tended to be on the fence I didn't think
you guys were just gonna go you know
totally anti-consumer on us and I think
we've seen that plenty of times in the
past that's no good PR for anybody but
when you keep it vague on purpose
you leave open that that interpretation
for us and what do you expect if you're
not gonna be explicit about what it is
we're gonna assume the worst because
maybe that's why you don't want to be
specific and then he says rather than
battling misinformation we have decided
to cancel the program look if you
thought this thing was like the next
godsend you wouldn't have canceled it
I'm pretty sure what you're doing here
is admitting to at least partial guilt
what some of the things people work
including based on the GPB program were
actually true he tries to justify it the
next sentence you know at a simple goal
ensuring that gamers know exactly what
they're buying can make a clear choice
again more vague stuff right he's not
trying to defend himself by spewing
specific like bullet point in fact he
doesn't have that here he's just keeping
things vague because that's how the
entire premise of GPP was founded
keeping it as vague as possible so that
we had no clue what Nvidia actually
intended to do you know when all this
originally surfaced GPP wasn't something
that I was just like all red-eyed and
angry about some tech channels just
jumped on the bandwagon and immediately
detested GPP and talked about how it was
super anti consumer and how NVIDIA is
just you know this is another way to
stab the consumer in the back right but
I didn't do this because I didn't have
all the facts at my disposal frankly
neither did they although I kind of see
now why they said that because if
they're willing to back off of GPP again
I think this is just like the ultimate
sign of at least some guilt because they
feel like they can't sustain a program
that is being trashed by the community
and rightfully so right for good reason
because we didn't have all the facts we
should have if you're willing to
announce a program and keep it vague and
allow us to create our own conclusions
what else did you expect it so
ultimately what this means the GPP is
now dead what that means for the
consumer really nothing at this point I
don't expect we're gonna notice any
significant change in any a OBS I've
talked to a few ask them if this affects
them at all and just off the top of
their heads they're not really expecting
too big a shift in demand and you know
and the way that they partner with both
AMD and NVIDIA assuming they have
connections with both I expect we'll
still see NVIDIA branding out there will
still see AMD branding on certain cards
you know AMD now has their own thing
kind of in response to GPP which no
longer exists so they've interesting to
see how that
lays down the long run but this video
more or less is just like an
announcement and kind of just me
laughing at Nvidia for once because this
is just it's just a little I don't know
it was a little silly to begin with it
shouldn't have been allowed to escalate
to this point and the fact that they're
backing off of it is just to me that's
an admission of guilt so enough about me
in my opinions I want to know what you
guys think in the comments below if you
feel like disagreeing go ahead and do
that I want to see you guys Duke it out
in the comments maybe I'll jump in if
things get really feisty those are the
best ones to jump into it's vetiver let
me know if I get some one thumbs up I
appreciate it thumbs down for the
opposite you click that red subscribe
