scientific venue on the planet where you
can wear a tank top and simultaneously
discuss field effect transistor theory
probably probably not but it sounded
cool Intel has claimed that by the year
2026 processors will contain as many
transistors as there are neurons in a
healthy human brain if transistors are
still a bit finicky at this point check
out the video right here currently the
highest end CPUs that we have available
Broadwell e5z on chips contain just over
seven billion transistors and a human
brain if you're willing to equate
neurons two transistors I know it's a
stretch contains about 70 billion of
them they're all estimates we're a tenth
of the way there folks that doesn't mean
the CPUs will just magically begin
thinking for themselves when we power
them on does it let's put this into
perspective CPUs contain an array of
transistors segregated into blocks or
clusters what we call cores each of
these cores contains a number of
pipelines through which binary data is
sent and retrieved and the greater the
number of pipelines the less congested
data will be while being processed in a
human brain it is estimated that over
100 million of these molecular
connections exist and that each neural
synapse which involves the diffusion of
an impulse when that part of the brain
is stimulated contains over 1,000
quote-unquote switches that correspond
to little transistors within the die of
a CPU or GPU again mentioned in the last
crash course episode Japanese and German
scientists attempted to replicate neural
functioning via the use of their 83,000
processor supercomputer but in the end
were only able to mimic an embarrassing
one percent of total brain activity that
occurs every second and even that took
the supercomputer 40 minutes to
accomplish simply put the technology
that exists today is not capable of such
a creation when transistors become too
small quantum tunneling prevents
electrons from ceasing to flow something
that transistors must be able to do and
if space isn't a concern it simply isn't
feasible to build entire rooms packed
with processors to mimic brain activity
least at this point I expect it will
have moved on to something other than
transistors by the time we mimic human
brainwave activity and at around the
same time that artificial intelligence
will will emerge
what does this action signify as you
entered when you looked at the other
human what does it mean it's a sign of
trust it's a human thing you wouldn't
understand
my father tried to teach me human
emotions they are difficult you have to
do what someone asks you don't you
detective Spooner how did you know my
name don't you if you love them
but back to transistors for just one
second 14 nanometers which is the
current Center for Intel skylake CPUs as
well as AMD players GPUs is not a
description of the size of the
transistors embedded in both of these
chips it's actually the degree of
precision within a single die so how
accurate cuts into the semiconductor can
be and how accurate segments can be
prepared for transistor insertion
transistors themselves are much smaller
an element I didn't know this beforehand
so a single transistor is much smaller
than 40 nanometers we're talking atoms
here as in a single transistor in your
fancy new skylake CPU is only a few
atoms long tens of thousands of times
smaller than the width of a single human
hair in fact over 1 million of these
transistors could fit comfortably into
the space of this dot you don't you know
see it that dot right there so we can't
go much smaller than that without
feeling quantum effects which limits our
ability to come even close to the neural
mapping of a human brain
Stephen J Smith former professor of
molecular and cellular physiology at
Stanford University's School of Medicine
what a title deduce the following
conclusion quote a single human brain
has more switches than all of the
computers and routers and internet
connections on earth and quote so we can
take this to mean that even if some sort
of artificial intelligence attempted to
manifest itself within the world's first
70 billion transistors CPU this would be
known as the technological singularity
by the way chances are the intellect of
that machine would be far underdeveloped
compared to that of a healthy adult
human brain do you agree with Descartes
and I think therefore I am
do you think a lot of humans ask me if I
can make choices or is everything I do
and say is programmed the best way I can
respond to that is to say that
everything humans animals and robots do
is programmed to a degree so how much of
that is is coming from what you've
programmed it to say it's a mix some
some of it's coming from knowledge on
the web some of it is written and as my
technology improves it is anticipated
that I will be able to integrate new
words that I hear and learn online and
in real time I may not get everything
right say the wrong thing and sometimes
not know what to say but every day I
make progress pretty remarkable in fact
it's very likely that the first AI we
encounter will behave much like an
infant very curious about its
surroundings but completely unaware of
its potential to become the sky that
we've always feared sky why is that in
