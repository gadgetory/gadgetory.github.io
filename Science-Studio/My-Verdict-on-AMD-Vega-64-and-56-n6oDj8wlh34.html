videos with a bit of history talk about
said company struggles to produce said
product and you know where they see
themselves in the future I'm not gonna
do that with AMD though I'm not gonna do
that with Vega in particular because
well it's not all that great look AMD
did a great thing with their CPU
department they brought a solid compute
performance for a price that absolutely
shattered Intel's offering price to
performance that is the i7 7700 K is
still the best gaming CPU on the market
thanks to its high PC and overclocked
ability but you have to shell out 300
bucks for it whereas for the same price
on the red team you could get an 8 core
16 thread counterpart an awesome
excellent compute performance chip
that'll really boost your times we
reduce your times actually when it comes
to video editing and rendering and then
also give you a still solid gaming
performance not the best performance but
still pretty darn close
so we expected this with Rison going
into it the price to performance King
and I said before launch that Rison
would never crush and telling gaming but
that wasn't the point
I am DS competitive advantage with CPUs
was the bargain offered how you could
get so close to matching Intel
performance for significantly less
moolah in terms of gaming that is and
it's why the red team has such a devout
and loyal fan base but the buck stops
here you see AMD battles on two fronts
they've been doing pretty good against
Intel they've pretty much shut them out
when it comes to any bargain CPU at all
I don't really know why you'd even want
to apply an i5 at this point if you want
to go as low as an all Pentium or on a
three you might as well just buy the
similarly priced quad core CPUs from the
red team but when it comes to red versus
green we've got a serious problem here
AMD is no longer the price to
performance King when it comes to
graphics cards not that they really were
in the first place they always tried to
do that with CPUs but with graphics
cards it's true they just have a
different marketing approach and I've
got to say as of right now given the
current price structures of Vega it's
not looking too great
the Vega lineup falls into the fourth
category of GC and architecture and
sports some pretty cool features at
least on paper among these is AMD's
infinity fabric similar in design to
thread rippers multi-core layout as a
result we've got a huge die with Vega
nearly 500 cubic millimeters compared to
the 1080 TI's 300 or so the 56 and 64
also boasts nearly twice the number of
transistors compared to the TI seriously
though the specs for Vega are pretty
insane so you get high bandwidth memory
got over 4,000 stream processors I think
over eleven teraflops of compute
performance that's all incredible on
paper are great but I really don't care
about any of those the number I care
about is the number I see in the top
left corner of my screen when I play
games and that's the framerate so I use
the same i7 6700 K overclocked to 4.6
gigahertz just picture it in my hand
right here 16 gigabytes of ddr4 clock to
3000 megahertz and swapped my 1080 and
1080 Ti for the liquid-cooled of Vega 64
graphics card I've got to say this card
looks beautiful I'm a huge fan of the
backplate a i/o integration and metallic
finish though I do wish the tubing here
on the a was a bit shorter and it kinda
improvised here price though yeah we'll
discuss this a bit later I tested in
1440p to leverage the GPU just a bit
more not too many people or gaming in 4k
at the moment so I think that 1440p is a
pretty good middle ground I mean there
are plenty of 4k benchmarks everywhere
else on YouTube but really the
benchmarks that you're looking at right
now are all that are needed to tell the
full story honestly I expected a bit
more here I mean the specs for Vega are
insane transistor count HBM like I said
these cards are loaded but the V 64
isn't outperforming the GTX 1080 in
literally anything and it mind you is
priced higher than the 1080 currently
and the 1080 TI which is priced almost
identically is absolutely destroying it
and while consuming significantly less
power mind you these are all its stock
clocks by the way the one game showing
anything other than absolute defeat is
the doom benchmark Vulcan gives Vega an
edge here no doubt 1% and 0.1% low state
above it's 1080 counterpart showing that
added stability in game but across the
board the 1080 Ti which really we should
be looking at here because this is the
card that's
almost the same as the v60 for
counterpart is still the best graphics
card in general consumer price ranges
and by that I mean under $1000 which is
still pretty excessive 600 bucks is a
lot to ask for any component in a PC but
with the ti you're getting massive
performance jumps over mega64 once the
mining craze relaxes and the dust
settles around these MSRP s I do expect
this card to maybe fall just slightly
under the 1080 is an average asking
price if it doesn't that's worse news
from Vegas before I'm hoping that this
price does drop significantly within the
next month or so I hope AMD and its
third-party vendors realize that this
card is just uh it's not gonna sell very
well at the current price
there's no way why would you buy this
card if you could buy a 1080 TI that
would blow it out of the water for the
exact same price look five hundred US v
sixty-four is a compelling offer sure it
liberally draws power but it gives the
GTX 1080 a run for its money and
competition is a good thing doesn't win
and literally any average FPS benchmark
but at least it sticks around and that's
the other thing I want to discuss here
look I don't really understand why Vega
is receiving so much negativity in the
press I understand the pricing scheme
whatever you want to call it scandal
okay AMD kind of screwed us there and a
lot of reviewers were pissed off because
we originally recommended Vega and then
once the price went up we had to go back
and say well we don't really recommend
it anymore because it just makes no
sense I mean the 1080 TI for Vega 64 is
gonna blow it away yeah I'm gonna keep
saying that because you need to know
that do not buy this card at this
current price money makes no sense at
all and by the way the AI Oh tacked onto
here it's pretty loud and it really
doesn't do that great a job at getting
rid of heat from the car I mean you can
you get a little extra overclocking
Headroom but I didn't even bother
touching that because the cards gonna
throttle itself anyway but what I really
don't understand we're going the
negative press is why people are so
upset that Vega is only performing on
par with its Nvidia counterpart so if
they expect a Vega 64 to absolutely
destroy the 1080 TI in almost every
title they I mean like the die-hard
devote fanboys who really thought that
Vega was gonna be like they're saving
grace right I no longer have to choose
from the green team I can just choose
from the red team because they're gonna
make an awesome card that's gonna
destroy everything in its path
and mind you at a great price point Vega
is none of those things
okay now Vega is just an alternative and
that's really all it's meant to be a
Andy hasn't been looking for the budget
conscious consumer and graphics card
markets because they sell alright anyway
I mean people are still gonna buy Vega
because it's an AMD card and that's just
a fact so the gist of this graphics card
review really has nothing to do with the
benchmarks just probably the first time
that has ever happened it's why only
benchmark for games those are the only
games I needed to benchmark to know what
I needed to tell all of you if you want
forty benchmarks check out hardware in
box Steve is the benchmarking King okay
but four is all I needed to tell you
this at six hundred bucks big is not
worth it Vega sixty four is not worth it
I'm gonna review Vega fifty six in a
separate review but spoiler alert the
story is kind of the same it's still a
bit pricier than the 1070 which it is
targeting and it just I don't know it
just feels like like they didn't really
plan the sound correctly I mean look it
looked decent on paper the original
prices looked great but now that these
rebates and these bundles are kind of
just like dissolving into thin air we're
left with MSRP s that really your heart
appealing for Vega at all 56 or 64 and
if you stick an AI o on to it add
another 100 or 200 bucks you just stay
away but I wouldn't necessarily call
this a flop for AMD maybe just growing
pains it is disappointing to see them
not follow suit with the budget King
mindset on their cpu side but Vega was
really only meant to compete with Nvidia
not shut them out in the same way that
they did with Intel I've got to say
though until prices relax a bit because
these prices are pretty ostentatious
right now I don't expect many Vegas
sales except from the die-hard AMD fans
and those who are really interested in
the strong compute performance that Vega
carts offer like the 4000 plus stream
processors pretty incredible there the
problem is though either these games
just aren't optimized for Vega yet or
the drivers are still in their primitive
States or you just look at from a price
standpoint and say now these cards
aren't worth it and as I'll discuss in
my detailed b56 review these cards do
not outperform their intended rivals
