hopefully not busting your eardrums that
tends to be a recurring theme with live
streams
why did my chatbox just disappear there
we go won't be able to see what you guys
are saying I'm too loud let me know
what's going on also I'm coming through
the speakers that's embarrassing that's
embarrassing that's embarrassing okay
now it's all gone I didn't realize that
I had my volume turned up in my headset
so I hate you know what I hate about
this is so stupid I hate that the webcam
is this just a cheap webcam at the c920
logitech whatever the one that everyone
has I just use it because I don't really
care about these looking super
professional I want these to be kind of
down down to earth like conversations
between you guys anyway I don't like how
this webcam has that weird kind of
scroll you see it sometimes with the
light but if you look at my forehead
especially when it's brighter you can
see those lines moving down there that's
the basically the sink rate of the frame
rate of the monitor are not monitored
but the frame rate of the camera kind of
interfering with the lights right
because the lights are flickering at a
certain refresh rate and if that's not
in perfect sync with the camera frame
rate then you have those issues so
that's kind of why you're seeing those
weird lines and I've noticed it's been
getting worse lately I think it's cuz my
the lighting in this room is just trash
because all of my studio lights are in
the film room now so as a consequence
I'm stuck using the one ceiling light in
this room with two out of its three
bulbs dead anyway
I mean that was good
gummy well Leeson you move in together
well she's my wife so I would hope that
she plans to move in with him he was got
to get her here and she's still a German
citizen so there's a lot of paperwork
involved with with that let's see we
have a philip downing so what's your
speculation on fan curves can't find a
good explanation philip i have a video
on pwm you should
check it out it's probably gonna answer
your question or at least part of it
that you set your fan curves to the
optimally the lowest right level
possible
so that they're quiet while also
maintaining an adequate level of cooling
so there's fine line there kind of like
with overclocking right trying to find
like that minimum voltage to hit the
highest overclock the highest frequency
so you're gonna play it up well bazinga
$50 that's like probably the biggest
donation I've ever received I you did
not have to do that I really appreciate
it but I feel like there's nothing I can
do in this chat to give you your money's
worth
let's see I'll answer your question
that's the best I can do for now
but I do appreciate that we're in page
six extreme four sticks of RAM and
Dempsey one dead so using a1 b1 a2 and
b2 okay Windows sees all RAM many issues
doing that no I mean you if you're
running I'm thinking a1 b1 a2 b2 should
be still channel or quad know if you
have seen okay so yeah you're probably
running quad channel still which is yet
if you have four sticks yeah if you're
running it that configure be fine
obviously if you put a module in that
dead slot you're gonna have a problem
yeah I think I think you're gonna be
fine there just be careful though
because that might not just be like a
motherboard issue you could you know
maybe at one point you slid a module
into that slot and something got messed
up
you just never know but I would say for
the most part you're gonna be fine doing
that okay here I see the spam I see best
motherboard for i7 8700 K from Taddy
ninja mmm I'm gonna say there are a lot
of them out there the one that I use
personally is the Asus hero I don't
remember if it's 10 a 2-0 10 its a z3 70
board from Asus the hero lineup it's a
great board it looks super sexy the asus
motherboard some of the best-looking out
there and their dang reliable because
they're AC so that's that's what I would
say but see has a dude 12 ask Greg do
you happen to watch anime and the answer
to that is
know any the closest I ever got to
watching anime when I was younger was I
always watched the yugioh series and
that came on because I was really big
like an elementary school and middle
school and did like the yugioh cards and
stuff so I watched that show a ton I
know if that really qualifies as anime I
never watched I don't watch like one
piece or dragonballs a year
Naruto or like any like a mainstream
anime series out there just because I
don't know I never really caught on to
it very much my brother is like a huge
Naruto fan but I never got into it he
also was a Dragon Balls even I think I
did it kind of like in rebellion like he
was such a fan of both of those shows
that like I purposely didn't watch I
don't know it's probably dumb excuse but
I just never got into it lit reviews
thank you for that $5 super Chapman dude
right now I have a G 4560 do you think
it's a good idea to get his each's have
any motherboard and then upgrade to a
7700 K and then get up and then get up a
750ti to a 960 960 TI not sure what
you're referring to there at legislate
960 yeah look your biggest bottleneck
right now is more than likely gonna be
that that CPU so what I suggest doing is
either swapping platforms altogether if
you're gonna buy a new motherboard
I would totally switch to Rison five
they get it Rison five 1400 or 2400 and
while 2400 when it comes out
Rison five CPU and then just kind of
roll with it that way because I don't
know if you want to stay locked on a
fork or a thread i7 when you know that
you could get a 6-quart 1237 from a
slightly newer generation than that so
it depends on the prices but that's what
I would do first
I definitely CPU upgrade first though
I'm gonna fix this I'm gonna fix this
thing right here yeah you guys are doing
just fine this is just me kind of being
a little crazy here I'm gonna make this
a little larger Center this up just a
little bit cuz I want it I want you guys
to see this just to honor the folks who
have that's the best I can do
let's Center it up just a little bit
or it kind of looks bad let's move it
down okay yeah that's not too bad yeah
that's good okay all right sorry about
that I was a little a little picky but
and that way you guys can see the super
chance because I think you guys are
super cool and I want you guys to be
recognized for that because you don't
have to do that to get your question
answered it just it guarantees it
answers you're going out of your way if
your fan ahmud I totally butchered name
dude I apologize any word on RAM prices
and the answer to that is gonna be like
the same as it was last time with these
live streams like it's not something
that I can predict I can't tell you when
they're gonna go down we can look at
past trends right when this happened
last time and kind of gauge it but it
ultimately depends on how fast the new
modules that the production cycles work
their way into the market what I will
say is that the companies in big big
doodoo right now for what they've been
doing will have to respond and we've
seen prices slightly come down anyway I
mean Ram prices are already cheaper here
in the states and they used to be
they're not where they should be right
you could get eight gigs of ram for 50
bucks you know somewhere around there
you could get 16 gigs for 80 $90
sometimes less than that but now 16 gigs
cost 150 hundred 60 bucks and it used to
cost $200 or more so we're kind of a
transition phase I would say you know
we're not gonna fully we're not gonna
see the market truly level out to where
the prices should be within the next six
months it's gonna take a while so you
never know but every now and then you'll
find one or two kits it's actually
priced really well and that's what you
want to go after
so anyway okay a couple more super chasm
to get to these bazinga thank you again
I appreciate that
only five of the 50s for you the rest is
for Pepsi and Lisa okay all right all
right I appreciate that and I'm sure
they will - thanks for clarifying a
little so no I'm just kidding
zoos I think that $2 Super chat would
you go with a fan text P 350 X or the
mesh if I see it depends of your price
range I think the I think the 350 X is a
slightly better value case that's just
that's just my two cents my input based
on the - I think you get like a cleaner
looking case with the mesh fic but the
the P 350 actually get more in it
right in the sense that like you get the
the customizable RGB ease and you still
get you know a wide chassis it's
actually gonna be wider and support you
know bigger graphics cards than the mesh
if I see wall because it's actually a
pretty slim case from a depth
perspective because there are some
graphics cards you can't even fit into
that case with an AI oh if you place it
up front which is the only way you can
really do it with a mesh for I see so
yeah I mean there are a couple things
that I'll take into account but I would
say overall the better case is a mesh if
I see but the P through 50 X is still a
really good value and it's hard to look
away from that okay I see you here
Alexander Padilla
can you bring Pepsi on camera oh she's
sitting right here girl
oh here the viewers want to say hi the
viewers want to say hi let's see if
she'll actually do it she's actually
being pretty chill right now she's
probably gonna bite me in a second but
she was just sitting at the base of the
on the floor right here just watching me
it's kind of strange she's gonna I don't
know where she's going okay anyway
yeah there's Bevis or whatever however
you guys said it you guys called her bet
this or something like you intentionally
misspelled it now I was cracking up that
was really funny anyway she is she's
doing well she just took a leap of faith
and I'm just gonna make sure she didn't
go behind anything anyway I see Eric
Perry what's going on thank for the $5
super chat my dude new GPUs with old
CPUs how far back in terms of CP before
you begin to bottleneck your CPU I mean
everything is gonna be a bottleneck at
some point right there's always gonna be
a bottleneck in your system than ever
why there's no such thing as like a
perfect balance because every game is
optimized differently all these
different hardware configurations are
gonna communicate differently right you
know some AMD CPUs work better with
NVIDIA GPUs like that was something that
people were investigating way back when
and it's just because certain you know
api's certain platforms developers favor
certain configurations and that's
something we have to work with but I
would say you could go back with Intel
as far as maybe ivy bridge is still
really good and a lot of people still
use ivory bridge that's still perfectly
viable and then AMD
it's hard because there's is kind of
like oh you got risin up here and then
you just you plummet into the abyss and
then you have the bulldozer piledriver
stuff you can see it's not even on
screen that's because it's so bad that
was his wife so pretty Houston so i mean
people used until when they were on
extreme budgets but anybody with a
decent amount of money would try to go
after intel because that was the only
viable platform for like a modern gaming
rig and the framerate disparities showed
that however however I will say that you
could still make a case for bulldozer
and piledriver on an extreme budget if
you can get either the you know FX 8350
or the 6300 for like 10 or 20 bucks and
then same thing with the motherboard
20 bucks and then maybe 60 50 60 bucks
for like eight or 16 gigs of ddr3 then
you've actually got a really sweet
platform for dirt cheap you know and
it'll still run games decently but I
can't attest to how much money you'll
get back because there's such a stigma
now against that architecture so I don't
know let's see here
Kirby would ask does a round peg go in a
square hole it's a good question it
depends on the diameter of the round peg
and the would you say I guess how long
one side of the square hole is but yeah
I'm sure you could probably figure that
out
bet this there it is Andrew lot I see it
you can bet this I think that's so funny
I don't know why like Pepsi is a weird
name already but bet this is just like
it's just left-field
okay here a trucker bomb dead battery
club you now have three bars trucker
bomb how does it feel to be in the
yellow battery club you almost have a
full charge I think it's gonna look so
cool when you guys get the full green
battery if you sponsor us for what three
months or so then you move up to the top
tier YouTube sponsor on our channel and
then you get the green battery so pretty
cute here alright cements amicus szymek
Assad I don't know anyway thank you for
the $5 super chat I had a problem where
I found out I had a dead Ram stick about
1.5 years after I bought them no
original packaging or anything can i
still RMA if you don't have the
packaging it's gonna be really tough you
now they the the modules usually have
like a sticker that'll say like you know
void
if removed or whatever usually
indicating that you tampered with the
product but I'm not - I mean I'm not too
sure about it I would say more than
likely no just because you don't have
proof of purchase if you I mean I don't
know how you know transferable these
warranties are they're not really like
cars so I honestly can't tell you but I
would say more than likely the odds are
no you won't be able to get that thing
service under warranty or replaced under
warranty okay let's see here scrolling
down all the good stuff you guys are
asking you guys are asking some good
questions here let's see okay hey grey
here's one from mr. Jackie lantern hey
Greg I recently bought an 1800 X with an
X 370 Taichi which current slash
upcoming RAM would give the best
performance with an overclock it's
really tough with the first gen rising
stuff that in that architecture is very
stubborn when it comes to higher o'clock
memory usually X and P profiles a no-go
unless you're using a rise and specific
kit I know G skill has some horizons
specific stuff out there team group has
I think a couple modules but you've got
to look for the the title right it says
like optimized for Rison or whatever and
that usually indicates that you'll be
able to get the overclock that you're
looking for on that platform so look for
that specific thing and go from there
okay I am scrolling down again I see you
guys I see the good questions thank you
so much for the good stuff you guys
given me content otherwise I'm just
gonna be looking like a fool doesn't
stare it into the screen okay we have
Raj Mir asked can you suggest an IO for
an 8700 K or 87 nurses or 7820 excuse me
for 28 degree to third-degree cells is
ambient temp because someone is saying
to 40 mils enough another says go for
280 or 360 for 5 gigahertz it really
depends on your CPU because every CPU
has been slightly different you know
what you have usually you have all these
wafers right that have all these dies on
them and they cut the dies down they
smash these things into chips and like a
really rough sense and then your
specific die is going to have a certain
perfection and the extent to which that
imperfection takes over the dye
determines how stubborn it is 2 volt
using voltage increases how you know
stable overclocks will be how high you
can overclock so it depends on your CP I
really can't tell you
obviously if you have more surface area
in your radiator you're gonna be better
off it's kind of like breathing room but
there's no sentence don't answer because
I haven't tested your CPU I would say
most cases to 40 mils fine though if you
are looking for like a die hard answer
ok here we go
Jeffy's Jeffy 8 6 9 6 s why does
caregiver and caretaker mean the same
thing dude that's like that's a
seriously good question I'm doubting the
English language that's pretty good
metal mods do you think in our 520 600
and a 1063 gig we'll have a good balance
or a lot of bottlenecking
again depends on the game I can't really
tell you on the surface though I think
your 10 60 is probably going to be more
of a bottleneck and that I'll tell you
what's really gonna be a bottleneck is
that 3 gig buffer so buying a 1063 gig
is just kind of like cut in the card off
at its knees in my opinion because there
are plenty of games now that'll utilize
more than that vram available in like a
modest resolution like 1080p so I would
say your graphics card first mainly
because of that semuc us again 2 dollar
super chet oh well thanks for the answer
no problem thank you for the 2 dollars
just to say thank you to me appreciate
it
or the Wreckers I saw a good one from
the records let me see them scrolling up
here the Wreckers 32 what do you think
is the best GPU to pair with an i3 8100
that's tough I would say 1050 1050 Ti
territory rx 560 kind of in that zone
you could probably go up I think max to
an rx 580 or a GTX 1060 don't go over
the 3 gig buffer go with a 6 geek buffer
just to be on the safe side and that
that's probably where I would leave it
anything higher than that your CP is
almost always gonna be the bottleneck
with that chip ranga at science to do
you should come to australia and build a
cheap used gaming PC using gam tree and
stuff it'd be a sick video also love
your pal
I appreciate that and I will be sure to
reach out to Brian who I talked with
quite a bit you guys know he's in the
discord he's more active usually than I
am in discord and our channels kind of
use the same server so we can you know
collaborate do all that stuff and share
ideas and everything it's the
communities actually meld really well so
yeah I want to go to Australia the
problem is it's just so expensive like a
plane ticket to Taiwan for example when
we go to copy Texas around 1,000 bucks
$1,200 and then to go from there to
Sydney or Brisbane or any other you know
decently sized city in Australia it's
gonna cost another thousand bucks to go
from LA to Sydney's and at least $1,500
and to go from where I am in Florida to
Sydney's like two grand so I don't you
know it would be great to go to
Australia but I don't love it that much
like that's a lot of money so anyway
okay I'm scrolling down here hey man is
my 2600 case still good yeah sufyani I
think that's how you say your name yeah
I mean that's fine like if unless you
see a huge bottleneck in the games
you're playing if your systems acting
really slow and you know it's not your
drive you to isolated that that variable
you know all right
that's CPU in most cases is still fine
whether you feel the need to upgrade is
entirely dependent upon what you do with
your see whether your with your system
ducks exist interesting name how often
do you change your motherboard or how
often do motherboards usually last for
someone that doesn't really need the top
gear every month I mean like I've only
had one motherboard I think ever died on
me motherboards for the most part of are
reliable they're just pains in the butt
to troubleshoot like you test everything
else on your system
only to find out that it's either your
CPU or your motherboard and once you've
narrowed it down that bar then you
essentially have to either buy a new
motherboard to test the CPU or buy
another CPU to test the CPD or already
have right so yeah that's a pain to
troubleshoot misty is doing something
crazy in there I don't know I bought her
this litter box so she she's had this
small you know smaller litter box and
she always like she'll go in there so do
what she's got to do and
she'll flick that litter all over the
floor and I've had to clean that thing
at least once every few days because
there's just litter all over the floor I
have it in our second bathroom so now
don't really use that for I mean I'm the
only one here when Lisa's here it's just
her and I we just use the master
bathroom so that one's pretty much
Pepsi's at this point and she just
throws litter everywhere so I bought her
this like concealed one they're not
concealed but it's sealed up so it's got
the the top part that covers everything
so when she flicks litter it doesn't you
know leave the box and actually spread
out but I don't know what she's doing in
there and like she's trying to take the
whole lid off I'll probably end up going
in there in a second only to find that
she's managed to get it off somehow
anyway back to tech cat cow cat Caillou
I don't know if I said that right kailua
s-- how do you feel how does it feel to
be in a relationship with someone that
has a different mother tongue like Lisa
speaks really good English I mean
considering like she speaks better
English than a lot of southerners speak
down here and I was something I took
pride in a high school like I actually I
hated English class but I I learned
quite a bit in English school I did
really well on my English placement
exams our AP tests and my AC T's and all
that stuff just because I don't know to
me it just it just clicked it made sense
like I would say a sentence in my head
and be like man that doesn't sound right
I would know exactly what to fix most of
the time and and she's actually I mean I
don't speak German so I don't know how
good her German is like you know with
respect to how good my English is but I
know that her English which is not
perfect I mean she still learns a few
words every now and then it's still much
better than many of my friends who have
lived here their whole lives and spoken
English their whole whole lives so and I
tell her that like she sometimes she
gets discouraged she's like you know I
don't know how to say this word like
i'll you know jabber a little bit and
i'll laugh at something she says cuz
it's just like so weird like like she
calls sky like when you like when you
say like you look up into the sky right
like she calls it heaven and i'm like
heaven means something totally different
and i mean I get what you're saying like
the heavens right like we use that every
now and then is like a hyperbole for you
know space or stars or whatever but she
calls the
I heaven so it's it's like she makes it
sound even more intense than it actually
is so I don't know I think I just think
it's interesting but it's really cute
too and she speaks really well though so
it's not really an issue for me I just
enjoy getting to teach her simple things
sometimes you know I'm like this word is
something we learn when we're in third
or fourth grade but to be able to teach
somebody who is learning is actually
really it's a really good feeling okay
the Jaypee Achilles I think for that
five dollar super check my dude do you
have any opinions on aftermarket GPU
coolers and not the type you get on AIB
cards more like this stuff
like the Arctic Exelero 4k I know what
you're talking about I haven't actually
tested one of those I was thinking about
doing like I know like palate I think
palates the manufacturer it might be
somebody else but I know like some of
those third-party GPU coolers out there
don't even require fans and I've been
wanting to test one for the longest time
like they work up to a certain spec
right so some of them won't work on like
a 1080 Ti right at the higher TDP higher
heat output per power consumption per
wattage consumed per watt consumed but
I've looked into that I haven't tested
anything yet regarding it but I would
like to and I actually have two 1080s
from EVGA that I I don't know what I did
I don't know if I threw them away
accidentally but I lost the stock like
air coolers on those cards so they've
just been fitted with water blocks for
the longest time so I've only had two
I've only been able to use them and my
custom loops but I've been thinking
about buying those third party coolers
just stick on those you know PCBs so
that I could actually use them in
air-cooled builds because I'm sick of
using them in water-cooled builds anyway
let's see here Shane Shane luzie what
graphics card goes well with an FX 8350
it's a tough one I would say up to maybe
a GTX 970 if you want to stay in Maxwell
gen stuff 1060 from Pascal and then
maybe rx5 7580 same thing like I
wouldn't go higher than that or you're
gonna notice some pretty serious
bottlenecks when it comes to CPU
intensive titles oh sorry I got a pre
through second Andrew locked why is
there not an m-80 xx 470 board it's
because M ATX is an its niche like we
were talking about this in the discord
like mhm
is literally only about that shorter
that much shorter than a full-size ATX
motherboard and they're often just as
wide so the only dimension that you save
when choosing m ATX versus full ATX is
the dimension of height which most
people don't care about and that's why M
ATX doesn't sell anywhere near as much
as it's ATX counterpart or let alone
ITX for that matter so it's all about
demand if you guys demanded M ATX way
more then you would see more options out
there but the demands not there and
that's why you don't see it and this is
like motherboard vendors have actually
told me this it's all about demand and
they just don't get enough you know
they're not incentivized enough to
mass-produce tons of micro ATX boards on
any platform let alone X 470 which is
relatively new by comparison
Bob Flanders what's going on Bob thing
for that $5.00 super chat says hi Greg
you probably know about Moore's law and
Murphy's Law but do you know about
Cole's law oh don't think so I know I
did I did a video on Moore's Law talking
about like the you know the the limits
of transistor theory and and like how
small we can get transistors packed into
dyes and whatnot but coleslaw I've never
heard of before so I will actually write
that down when I write it right here in
this Word document
because I want to read about that that
sounds fun and just so you guys know the
reason why I say thanks for learning
with us at the end of every video is
because I usually have to learn this
stuff right before I deliver whatever
content I'm delivering I mean nobody
knows things when they're born you have
to learn things so it's it's a way for
me to kind of juxtapose myself next to
you and say look I'm no different you
know you're learning this from the video
if you don't already know it and I had
to learn this from some other source so
welcome to the club you know it's gonna
like me trying to just show them I'm no
different than anyone else learning
something because people tend to think
we have huge egos I used to have a
really big ego I don't care as much
anymore about it like I if YouTube
doesn't work you know I have I have
other plans I have my degrees I have
stuff I could do but I want to keep this
around I want to keep you guys here I
want to keep you happy because this is
fun you know and so this is pretty much
every time but I love
what I'm doing and it's into the dollar
really to be able to talk to site 265 of
you randomly on a Sunday night the fact
that you would take time to watch this
live stream is awesome
and I really do appreciate that okay
let's see somebody says rubes for cubes
says teach your cat to go outside my cat
used to use a litter box but he grew out
of it yeah I don't want I don't want a
Pepsi going outside of there like it
when you when you introduce a count to
the outside world like there are so many
other things to consider you know they
can get scratched by cats and get
infections they they can get fleas and
mites and all that crap we have an
outside cat my parents do kind of he
kind of goes in and out whenever he
wants he's like he's so lazy and sport
like he comes in eats and then leaves
and like you just faked he takes full
advantage of my parents basically but he
has the key had this problem with mites
in his ear and he still has that problem
and he only got it when he started going
outside so it's just something that I
don't want to put Pepsi through right
now and it's gonna cost more to because
you got to give them you know special
shots and stuff and I'm not into that
potato genic thank you for that one
dollar super chat potato I'm looking for
a question that you asked right I know
you can't like type a message with a one
dollar super chapter that's really
stupid you should be able to if you pay
a cent I already care but I don't see a
question from yeah no I don't see one
okay let's take a question here from
earnest L do you have a degree in
computer science or information systems
if so can you elaborate on your
experience I have a degree in petroleum
engineering which emphasizes right the
extraction of petroleum hydrocarbons
from the ground but it's when I explain
it to people I tell them that a lot of
it overlaps with mechanical there are a
lot of mechanical principles we have to
abide by when we drill into the earth it
overlaps with geology it overlaps with
chemistry and chemical engineering
especially like the separation part of
it right when you're separating the
chemicals and processing plants and
what-have-you so it's it's more like if
you can't really relate to the petroleum
part just think of it like a specialized
mechanical engineering degree is
essentially what it is and I chose it
because at the time like the economy was
booming and energy was was hot right if
you worked in the energy sector
you got paid big bucks so I mean look
you're gonna work right and most people
don't enjoy what they do when they work
that's why they call it work and if I'm
gonna work I want to make the most money
I can working so that was my idea that
was the thought process I had little did
I know that YouTube would become my
full-time job so yeah I just goes to
show you that nobody can plan for the
future not in this way so yeah but the
good thing is though I kept my options
open I finished school I'm about to
finish with my masters in business admin
so I can really take that anywhere but I
I'm you know at this point I'm not using
it I'm not using my bachelors either and
I think that's really cool
so yes see Taipei Taiwan ten patron
engineering pays close to 100k per year
within three years yeah when when we got
hired and I know this is off topic I'm
sorry I'll get to your questions when
when we got not hired but when we were
recruited to this school cuz I was
originally going to Business School and
then my dad told me he's like hey check
out this school they're telling you like
they can get you a hundred percent job
placement the energy sector is doing
really well and this and that and I was
sold on it like you know I was looking
at the salaries looking at the work that
they do and I'd always thought geology
was cool and that kind of overlapped
with petroleum engineering so I was like
yeah screw it I was a little scared of
the math but my brother is a math whiz
so he and YouTube
Patrick jmt from YouTube he and my and
my brother helped me through my
differential equations calculus classes
like that's a big helps and a lot of my
success at least in those you know
degree pursuits go to them but that was
something that I was sold on right was
like the heist the high-paying salary
and then once OPEC flooded the market
with petroleum and we were kind of stuck
just processing petroleum but not
actually extracting it like drilling
into the ground thousands of feet most
of the time offshore we didn't really
have job offers and I never really plied
really hard for like but by the time I
started getting serious about looking
for a job in the field was when YouTube
for for me was already starting to pick
up pretty high so right around the time
that I had bought all that Apple gear
right I spent like two thousand bucks
buying a bunch of
bullcrap right around the time that
video got really popular exciting that's
I think that to date is our most popular
video it's like a million 1.2 million
views whatever I'm pretty sure that was
when I decided I was like okay I can do
YouTube full-time and I didn't actually
put out job offers because you know I
didn't go to career fairs anything like
that because I just didn't think it
would be worth it so you know I just
wanted to give this a shot in worst case
it didn't work you know if this YouTube
channel dies tomorrow I hope it doesn't
but if something happens tomorrow you
know hopefully I'll have something to
fall back on I don't just want to put
all my eggs in this basket because
that's what I did before this when I
applied for the Air Force Academy and I
was there for like two weeks and I
decided no I'm not doing this so you
know I didn't have a fallback plan
that's why I went to business school so
anyway there's there's a history of my
life so sorry about that for those you
were with something and more interested
hmm okay here what about a crude oil CPU
cool or interesting Sean Campbell I'm a
cyber security major any advice before I
graduate I'm not I mean cybersecurity is
not really my forte like programming
software stuff is like beyond me that's
all we'll stuff like wills of Wilkin
like speak like ten different
programming languages like it he'll
learn languages overnight you know I had
to sit down and just like study it and
see how it differs from like c-sharp and
all these other ones that he's already
familiar with and and just pick it up
what's going on Chris I see crystals in
the chat what's going on man I see you
there we have a super chat from defi TV
what's going on defi think that fob
Dallas super chat I have an i-5 6600 K
alright and a 1063 gig looking to
upgrade to either a 2700 X or an 8700 K
and a 1070 T I went 1070 or RTI what
would be the best combo for streaming
keep it up if you're streaming I would
say like I'm using the the 2700 X right
now I think the 2700 X is a really great
step up from the 1700 X I don't like
it's worth upgrading specifically from
the former to the latter but I think the
2700 X is a great multitasking CPU it's
mmm it's much easier to just run X and P
with the new stuff you have the 12 min
of your fabrication it's also easier to
overclock
you know you don't require as much
voltage to get the same overclocks it
means the CPU runs cooler means it'll
last longer and it generally will do as
well when streaming and playing games as
the 8700 k with with a few minor tweaks
so yeah that's what I would go with and
I think the 1070 would be good enough
for you in most cases 1070 TI if you can
get it for around the same price of the
1070 which is the case in most cases
because it's it's so common right now I
think the 1070 TI came out when the
market was just really really hurting so
there's a there's a surplus of them in
inventory so that's why you see 1070
TI's everywhere
it's my pro to get one up okay let's see
Francis a is a d3 is a ddr3 system or
worth it today Francis I don't know the
answer that question because I don't
know how much money we're talking you
know like I said early if you rewind the
livestream I was talking about an FX
platform with a graphics card that's
that's where I would probably stick it
in that price range oh let's see here
legend the legend burl ESS is still
waiting for you to do the crash dance
the crash dance is on screen right so
whenever somebody subscribes or donates
then we get a crash bandicoot crash
manicure is my favorite game of all time
by the way if you're gonna spam I see
what you did mr. Antoniou nobody else is
gonna see but if you spam the chat with
a bunch of emojis to get my attention
and then have the audacity in the same
comment to ask for free stuff because
it's literally how you ordered it can
you give me free stuff I'm going to
Baron hammer you I don't like doing it I
really don't but it's not fair to
everyone else ok mmm worst patch to get
old GPU for the price from record 32 I
don't really know that's really tough I
think that I mean like the 1050 - yeah
like what's the crap they've been doing
with the 10:30 in the 1050 the different
I haven't even really been following up
the issues with the RAM the speed of the
RAM like the lower end stuff is where
Nvidia really tries to chop you look
they try to do that with the 970 right
so they're kind of doing a similar thing
with a 1030 and it might get a 1050 I'm
confused you know which what I'm talking
about but I think the lower end stuff
there's like there's a lot of sneaky
stuff going on so just be careful and be
aware of what you're looking for ok
let's see here we have computer man
asked should my CPU cooler be ok if I
left it out for a month
should it be ok if you left it out we're
talking about its it is not covered
could you help me I don't know even by
cover like if there's just sitting on
your desk I'm pretty sure it's gonna be
fine I'm not I don't know what you're
talking about
Jerry Watson are you going to buy a
Tesla no I just bought a I just bought a
q60 red sport Infiniti I don't like
Tesla's I've never been in a Tesla's
like I don't know what I like it it's
cool like it's an electric car awesome
but like to me they're not worth the
money they're really not I prefer an
engine sound to be honest with you
anyway so even if it came down to you
know equal maintenance you know even if
gas was pretty expensive I would still
probably choose the gas car not because
I'm trying to be defiant or stubborn I
just appreciate petrol engines I like
the sounds of them I like being able to
work on them I'm an engineer kind of
fits right I like learning about cars
about car engines how all that stuff
works and I think it just fits fits the
profile bit better Deniz Rick didn't
think of that $5.00 super chat for your
love of Crash Bandicoot same here and
slam the hammer what's going on my dude
he's the swiftrage swiftrage in the chat
is swiftrage doing something down there
I can't always keep up with this stuff
so if I we need a we need a couple
applicants for some moderators on the
chat and when you get the moderator link
then you're I see Chris I'm gonna mod my
mod Chris chris is a Chris works of
course there let's see add mod there you
go Chris it took me a while to find you
again but there you go so Chris can mod
whenever Chris has time
Brian's stager says you should get a
Dodge Hellcat I don't like the looks of
dodges I think they just say I never
really liked muscle cars like that I
like I think I don't know I just there's
a certain affinity I have for foreign
cars I've always felt this way it's why
I'm like my first real car that was my
own other than one I leased beforehand
was a an Audi s5 I love that car with a
v8 and then this one's a Nissan Infiniti
my dad had a GTR so I always wanted to
get something kind of like that and then
my dad has an Audi now and I want an
Audi like him so I just I don't know he
I've got I've been following him but I
really like those kinds of cars it's
just my preference the Hellcats it's
fast I know it's fast AF and it's mean
it sounds good but it's just not my
style it's really not okay
Patrick Williamson says you don't like
Dodge unsub I'm so sorry Patrick I'm not
gonna I'm not gonna tell you what you
want to hear so that you do so I'll tell
you that okay here we go
John Mark fk hey man if I were looking
to get into YouTube what would you
recommend camera wise you could I would
recommend to either of g85 or ag7 from
Panasonic microwave for thirds a war
maybe a Canon 5d like a 5d Mark what 5d
Mark 4 or they have mark for now I know
canons are really good for video they
have great autofocus systems but that's
probably where I would stand I wouldn't
go full full-frame mirrorless I think
going with like a Sony a7 3 would just
be too much money when you get started
you want to at least see if you can get
it off the ground first so investing
that much money in something that you
don't even have like a you know a solid
foundation on yet is just a little too
risky for me ok nanner plant I 380 feet
8350 k how do you feel about it I think
it's a step in the right direction but
it's still an i3 and it still costs
quite a bit of money I don't think it's
as ridiculous as a 73 50 K which was my
box opener of choice for a long time but
it's still an i3
and look I got nothing against I threes
my first modern computer was an i3 i3
was an i3 hot cheese 4041 fit 4150 what
am I thinking of i three i'm can i can't
remember it was a has well i three and I
must that was like most recent i3 pci
built and it was okay but I think that
there are better options from horizon
than the i3 so that's my two cents in
that matter neo dubs what are your
opinion the new MacBook Pros look I've
only really been interested in the
13-inch MacBook Pros I have a 13-inch
MacBook Pro the previous gen but it
still has like this the the new design
right the new chassis I just think that
the you know the fact that the the
13-inch MacBook Pros don't come with
dedicated graphics discrete graphics
like an MX 150 that's a deal-breaker now
because I use the Huawei made Book Pro X
and I think it's sitting yeah it's
sitting right there so that's the
hallway the may pick Pro X is awesome
guys for about 1500 bucks you get an i7
right the quad core KB like our i7 and
you get an MX 150 discrete graphics chip
which can actually run decent games for
what it is you can play pub Jean
fortnight with it on the lower settings
in 1080p which is actually pretty
impressive especially for an ultrabook
13 inches it's really thin so I knowing
that I could get a laptop like that now
with an almost identical footprint to
the MacBook Pro 13 inch model I think
that that MacBook is just not even in
question anymore the 15-inch MacBook
Pros they're great I just don't like the
way that you know the throttling thing
that's not too big a deal for me like I
had I think people kind of blew that a
little out of proportion
although it should be noted people
should know what's happening I think
it's fine to report on it but to just
condemn MacBooks for having this problem
like that's a little ridiculous because
almost every laptop out there that's
thin and light is gonna you know is
gonna thermal throttle to some extent
under certain workloads and a lot of
these people who were testing the
MacBook 15 inches we're putting them
under insanely artificial and heavy
workloads so you know I just don't see
it really being a viable way to test
performance because other than like
serious content rendering and stuff like
that which if you have a MacBook use
Final Cut Pro is gonna be lightning
quick anyway
when would you actually need to be
worried about that so anyway that's my
take on Apple I don't like defending
them I've never really been like a
die-hard Apple fan I like the simplicity
of iOS for it for phones but I think now
I've moved on from mac books I just
there are there are better options out
there especially now for the price okay
Dennis I know I see row row row gender
sing subdued so you playing your
PlayStation it's wack PlayStation is
wack sup what the wack PlayStation so
I'm glad I read that oh okay here Bhatia
100 says why buy the i9 then that's
because the i9 is actually if you look
at synthetics the i9 is still a better
performer than the i7 like there's a
reason why it exists and it's because
it's a better chip it does give you
better fits I'm marginally I'm not sure
I haven't run tests myself but the i9 is
there for a reason because it is a
better chip despite it thermal
throttling under certain scenarios so
you know take it for what it is I just
don't like it when people can dam a
product because it's a product you know
like it Apple does do shady stuff I know
okay
it doesn't elude me that they do but at
the same time I mean if we're gonna hold
Apple accountable for this stuff I think
there are other companies that do
similar things that we should be
consistent about yeah I use Mac books
the longest time because of Final Cut
Pro it was the best rendering content
creation solution at the time I didn't
care what Apple was you know I the the
keyword thing was an issue that came up
later on and that was something I
condemned the right away and I could
attest to firsthand cuz my space board
did go to crap and I had to take it
apart myself and fix it almost breaking
a few of those little grooves that hold
the thing in like hold the key into the
board so yeah I was a pain anyway just
Pepsi sitting right here under the
monitor she's gonna scare and me she's
my buddy cable anyway
let's see here yo gender I did read your
comment I read your question already why
you're asking why I changed my channel
name I change that a long time ago and I
talked about that and those in that
video the dedicated video talking about
the channel name I talked about why I
changed it you're asking a question I
already answered in a video let's see
thanks for getting my name right by the
way a lot of people mess up the
pronunciation Mari Africa more America
that's why I would say I'm pretty sure I
said that the same way the first time
mostly I'm consistent
epic country 11 do you plan on having
children I mean yeah I hope so I think
the kids are a cool way to pass on your
legacy and just makes life exciting word
otherwise would begin to get very boring
I guess I don't know it's just it's the
next step it just makes sense but not
hopefully for a while
I would say maybe a few years down the
road there's one will consider that okay
a nanner plant is this a balanced combo
8600 ka with a 1080 sure for gaming I
don't know you're certainly you guys
aren't giving me enough info so I can't
really tell you but I would say in most
cases sure yeah
toxic masta what is your personal rig
specs I have two of them that I switch
out between all the time the 2,700 X 32
gigs of ram 1070 TI and the 8700 k 1070
TI 32 gigs of ram and i content create
in game on both of them i livestream on
the 2700 x primarily because of the
extra horsepower behind the extra cores
but the 8700 k is my gaming rig
primarily because it's an AV 700 k and
then my rendering rig is in the other
room film room and that has a 79 80 X in
it which is overkill not something I
would buy on my own I just have it at my
convenience so I figured what the heck
okay Pepsi stop clawing my hand that
hurts I swear this cat her claws are so
bad let's see stop it stop stop you you
pick Hannah asks how did you introduce
yourself to your wife I didn't introduce
myself I mean we kind of like she she
worked for a company that that helped us
get to Computex last year company takes
2017
and we met them there is the first time
ever right underneath Taipei 101 and you
know I didn't know anything about her I
had sent her a few emails online that
was it but it kind of took off from
there so yeah it's kind of weird to
explain like that and trying to keep it
short and sweet but it was really cool I
mean she was I thought she was beautiful
and I just didn't know if she was you
know already with somebody or Ektron you
married whatever you know you don't know
you don't know somebody's story when you
first meet them so that's what we spent
a lot of time that week in weeks
following that just chatting online and
stuff on skype and what-have-you
getting to know each other and I flew to
see her for the first time in Germany
after that and just you know you just
you just experiment what you're trying
to see if it works you know you want to
see if you're compatible with this
person I knew she was I knew she was a
good girl you should be good for me and
that's why we're married now not that I
deserve to be married to her I mean she
deserves far better than me in my
opinion but she puts up with all the
crap I give her and I love her for it
quick shot gaming how well do you think
an ace detect 545 LC would cool a 1070
reference style the prebuilt I bought
can only support a 92 millimeter fan
that's gonna be I don't know I haven't
actually tested anything like that so
that's kind of tough the 545 LC I'm not
I'm not sure I don't want to give you
the wrong impression because I haven't
actually tested the hardware I apologize
we'd have to super chat me to get that
question basically shot down but I just
don't have hands-on experience with it I
would refer to forums on if it's the
best I can do for you because I just
don't know the worst case you have to
you know down clock the 1070 frequency a
little bit I don't think you'll be like
in a terrible situation
okay okay scrolling back down here
did I miss somebody I feel like I missed
I missed a super chatter - oh okay I see
yeah okay I see Dennis rigdon says
swiftrage is basically an angry face and
mode on twitch oh I don't I don't even
like I don't twitch brah so I don't even
know like any of those references now if
you're really dumb at the boy Icarus
think of that $2.99 super chat love the
channel man keep it up I appreciate that
thank you very much and then one more
here Brandon they that's his name
Brandon they donated five bucks to the
super Chet I appreciate that he says
building a Corsair theme to PC you
wanted to know your opinion on what case
I should yet the crystal for 60 X 570 X
or speck Omega look I hate the 460 X I
mean I think I think it looks really
good but it's a pain to build and I
think the basement isn't dumb and I said
that in my review of the 400 C and I
think I also reviewed which what did I
review after that the 460 X was it the
460 act I don't remember I know I did -
like videos one on the original 400 C
and I think one on the newer model and I
just I couldn't get over how difficult
it was to build it so Godspeed it's
gonna look really good if you finish it
and do it in a timely manner managed to
keep the cable management in check but
460 is a really big pain to deal with
spec Omega it's probably gonna be your
best bet from that perspective okay I'm
scrolling down okay the coffee addicted
writer asked why no twitch and it's
because we don't have a huge twitch
following so like if all of you guys
went and subbed word not sub but just
like followed us you know the payoff
money or anywhere ever but like if you
just follow us on Twitch then that's
that's cool because then maybe that'll
motivate me to stream on Twitch but when
I stream live on just twitch I get like
10 or 20 viewers like why would I do
that when I can get to 50 here you know
sometimes more than that so that that's
the thought process behind avoiding
twitch for now you guys got a jump onto
the platform show me you want twitch if
you want me to move over there
Jimmy 140 to Schmidt do you think cable
my cables are worth it yeah look I think
that they're they're pretty expensive
right for what they everything about
they're just cables but they make the
build up so much better if you have the
extra money in your budget to work on
aesthetics and your build if you care
that much about it
I think custom cables are some of the
best investments from an artsy kind of
perspective right making your build look
good I think I think that's one of the
best investments you can make and cable
mod they they put these cables together
so quick and you can kind of customize
it you can decide if you want to spend
more money on pro cables that you know
if you want to spend more money on combs
if so what kind of combs you know you
want the metal
the plastic combs or whatever they give
you a lot of options you know you don't
have to buy every cable out there you
can buy specific cables custom
extensions whatever they give you all
those options and their configurator
that's what I really like about cable
one is they're so diverse in what they
offer and if you think about it I mean
what you're getting aesthetic wise for
the price isn't all that bad when seen
in the context of what you're bill to
probably cost to begin with okay my
voice is so shot I'm try who okay I see
a few questions from I'm trying to go
back and see if I missed okay all right
Sam Fisher any thoughts on the upcoming
next-gen GPUs also should someone who
want to buy attend ADT I wait for the
1180 TI if you want to wait wait I can't
tell you how bad that you want to see
the graphics card if you want a graphics
card now buy a 1080 if you want to if
you feel like waiting
I think waiting is worth it it just I
don't know your thought process so I
can't answer that for you what I wait it
depends do I need it now if I didn't eat
it right away I would think I would wait
that's probably what I would do I don't
really look into like the rumors behind
next-gen GPUs I usually wait until we
get solid evidence that this card will
perform this well we have evidence of
like - how the architecture is gonna
relate to different you know the T
flawed values and all that stuff I like
to see the figures before I start making
speculations about stuff like that
let's see epic hunter says very nice
facial structure my dude thank you for
that appreciated I appreciate that he
says you could pull off being bald yeah
I probably could but I would look I
would I would look like I was 35 I don't
know let's see
Greg please help I can't find I can't
fit my cable extensions inside of my
p400s that's tough I know that feeling
like I know how tough it is they get
those cables smashed into that right
side panel especially when you have
extensions what I suggest doing is
trying to wrap some of those cables
behind the motherboard tray like for
instance your 24 pin run it up along the
the back edge of your cake
where you would normally run your
eight-penny PS run your 24-pin back
there as well and then have it connect
to your extension right behind your
motherboard and then you can have the
extension wrap perfectly around through
the rubber grommets and the p400s to
give you that clean look that's
sometimes what I do with built like that
when I can't fit those extensions behind
you know the section of the mugwort ride
just above the hard drive bays anyway if
you ever did if you ever did you would
have Dennis rig deny that that syntax
might do that that's it's pretty pretty
bad well I think you're asking if I'd
ever want to build Walter White again if
you ever did you would you would have to
oh if he ever did you would have to
rebuild Walter White I see what you're
saying now okay I had to dissect that I
thought it was just like like mismatched
words but now I see what you say no that
would be cool and then I could then I
could say say my name I am the one who
knocks okay I love that show
what's your opinion on the penny mg 4560
I think it's a fine CPU on a budget
although I it would be really tough for
me to recommend the Pentium over Rison
three or Rison five like it's really
tough like the lower end Intel stuff is
just really tough to contemplate in my
head over a risin play if I was building
a system in that price category I would
go with the risin three or five any day
of the week just because I know I get
the extra horsepower from the cores if I
run into a situation with the cores
themselves bottleneck me I don't have to
worry about that as much on the rise in
platform if I want a multitask try
streaming on a G 4560 it's gonna be
tough you know even if you have an
overkill graphics card like a 1080 TI so
that's how I see it anyway okay a couple
more questions here it's 9:55 I try to
give you about an hour's length or so I
appreciate all the good stuff you guys
and just a heads up tomorrow I'm gonna
be finishing my one of my finals for
class so and it's exciting because I
only have two more classes after that
and then to not not for I have two more
classes left and then I will have my
masters which is freakin crazy I never
thought of
master's degree but yeah then I saw
graduate in October I'll be finished
classes on October and I'll walk the
aisle walk the aisle walk the stage in
December
how Pepsi cheese she just dug her nail
through the bed of my nail like that
that was painful okay let's see here
Nostradamus as an engineering major are
you pleased with I'm not an engineering
major anymore I have my engineering
degree I I just didn't really I mean
Manresa ecology was moving really slow
sorry to answer your question yeah he
has are you pleased with where
technology innovations are going do you
think it's quite slow yeah I didn't I
didn't really think that it was you know
moving that slow when I was just
consuming products when I was a typical
consumer buying stuff I was never that
informed I was never like waiting for
the next thing because I felt limited by
the technology I had I just learned to
make do with it there's no sense in like
being angry about the state of
Technology because how do we know what's
coming up you know next like it we get
these rumors and stuff we don't really
know what your performance numbers so we
don't know what price to you know value
is gonna be that value perspective is
always something to question and that's
why reviewers like like myself exist out
there right to answer the question
so anyway okay by the way if you spam
the chat you get ban Hamid I should
probably just be like putting you guys
in tied up then I feel like you're gonna
be doing it again I don't think it's
banning you from the old channel so I
think you're fine there but don't spam
that's just not proper etiquette okay
why make fortnight for a mag if they are
not built for gaming um oh I mean that's
a it's a question I really don't want to
get into I think you could really game
on anything I think the MacBook 15-inch
is capable of gaming it's not a great
game or it's not a gaming laptop but
it's capable of doing it so I think the
the way you worded it's a little
misleading
I agree ok well I'll give you that
though it's not built for gaming sure
but you can game on it and that's why
they showed you that you could that's
why it's there Ruby PC customs what's
going on
I hope your Sunday night is going well
my dude Tony is uh if you guys don't
know Tony is you should by now click on
his channel check him out he has a lot
of cool stuff behind the scenes with his
experiences custom loot building he's
done like cable did I do cable
extensions
he's sleeved a bunch of kits for us and
I always try to remember to give him
shout outs when he does because he he
just he doesn't his free times a really
cool dude
and I appreciate that he says if you
could only use one case manufacturer
from now on who would it be and what is
one thing you would change about their
cases that's tough
basically asking me to sell out to a
company Tony he's trying to trap me here
I think that the company making the best
cases right now Pepsi if you bite my leg
one more time I'm gonna lock you out of
this room
it hurts it hurts stop it girl
ok I would say that I like fantex a lot
I like fractal design a lot I like Lee
and Lee a lot I like I like a few cases
from NZXT a few cases from deep cool a
few cases from insert case manufacture
here it's a really tough I don't give
you an answer I would be happy with I
think that the top three for me right
now are Lee and Lee because of their
dynamic how great the dynamic was thanks
in part to their collaboration with your
Bower and I also like fantex I think
fantex cases in general are really nice
and then I think fractal design makes
very clean cases so between those three
that's what I'll give you sorry I know
that's not one but that's as good as I
can get as close as I can narrow it down
nice tree here are a couple more
questions folks and give me the good
stuff we get about two or three minutes
in this livestream and then I'm gonna
caller because my voice is dead bazinga
says great try having to cast like I
have I've thought about it people told
me that having two cats actually is
better because then the cats can
socialize between each other and not
bother you all the time how especially
when I'm gone right she's alone usually
she just sleeps when I'm gone
but yeah that's something I've thought
about wait I don't know yet she bit my
foot and now she's looking it she's like
I'm gonna bite you oh I'm so sorry
cats typical cats let's see fantex
Eclipse p400s or mastercase pro 5 in my
experience the p400s is a really good
case I don't think I've built in the
mastercase pro 5 but I think you can't
go wrong with a p400s let's see here
when is the asus rog AIO coming out I
have no idea I don't I've never even
heard of that before
most the closes that were with a snooze
with their motherboards and occasionally
a graphics card excuse me
ok let's see Elias our can ask why is it
that in some games like League of
Legends I get lower fps because it's not
using my graphics card usage that would
be optimization you could also be
limited by your CPU League of Legends is
not a super intensive graphical game so
you're gonna be playing more than likely
at a pretty high frame rate and that's
usually gonna chop your CPU at its needs
before your graphics card so something
to look at don't look at just GPU usage
watch my you know how to bring up the
system stats video and it'll show you
all of your stats so you can see
everything in relation to one another
you can identify bottlenecks that way
it's actually a really good way to do
that ok Apple device Pro what state are
you in
I am in Florida and let's see me a
couple more give me some good stuff
mahir patel why not Chua got get a
really horrible color scheme going on
not to has always been that way as far
as I can remember you've always had that
brown kind of industrial look they do
have black fans they do have fans like
that just just throwing that out there
but occasionally they'll come up with
just like a you know brown kind of tan
tinted fan I know like they're their
newest industrial-grade fans like really
quiet and I shouldn't say industrial
give it the quiet ones come in the brown
color scheme and that's just not joy you
know people buy them anyway because
they're really really quiet there
they're almost silent
and I mean that's why knock she was not
sure right
excellent cooling is this we area
specially air cooling Johnnie fart
Johnnie fart gas I love that name I saw
that last time why aren't you a rapper
because I just can't I can't go on that
long my rhyming isn't that great
I can talk pretty fast but my rama's
never that good so Sean Campbell what is
your favorite build to date it's a
really tough one I'm not really too sure
I built a recent white custom loop in
the white dynamic from Lee Ann Lee P Co
11 dynamic that was one of my favorite
favorite builds I really like my
Andromeda custom Lee build I think
Andromeda in the fractal design C was a
really nice custom loop and one of my
best just because it was such a compact
build it was really tough to get some of
those bends in there but it was so clean
afterwards I think Andromeda is probably
gonna be one of my best built of all
time just because of how technically
difficult to what to get some of those
bends in there so anyway alright one
more question give me one more question
you show me the good stuff folks I
appreciate it show me the good stuff and
we will be out of here I need the good
stuff I need a question
give me a good question any question
I'll wait for the chat to catch up to
the live stream and then I give me a
second and then let's see I want to see
him flood in the good stuff folks any of
the good stuff any of the good stuff
alright I see him I see him rolling in
oh all right I like that Robo coffee are
you a fan of metal gear series
absolutely except I'm a fan more or less
of the older metal gears Metal Gear
Solid was one of my favorite games
growing up let's see I see I think it's
uh Samuel how how old is your cat she's
like five months four months something
like that she's not very old I think
she's still technically a kitten she's
pretty small still growing a lot and
then let's see here what is the next
best time to purchase PC parts I love
Blake it's looking pretty good right now
apart from RAM which is still pretty
expensive graphics cards have come down
a lot I think now you should start
considering building if you haven't
already
and the last question here would you
rather work with
ltte or a bit wit that's from lo Joe
dojo that's a good question I get
appends on the content like if I was
looking for something like really
creative and funny and like just like
catchy I think I wouldn't want to work
with bit wit cuz Kyle's personality just
fits the bill I think like the guys he's
just he's made for YouTube so and I and
I've met Kyle personally a few times and
he's a cool dude you know he's he's real
as real as he is on video that's him in
real life I got a lot of respect for the
guy so Kyle for that kind of stuff I
think for the more like technical
content like the you know adventure type
like trying a new thing experimental
stuff I'd want to go with Linus tech
tips because they have all of that space
at their disposal I mean come on it's
Linus and you know I think that would
just be a better environment for us to
do tests like that so if we ever were
given an opportunity like that then I
would hope it would be from him because
he just he has the infrastructure in
place and all the tools and equipment
needed to mod and create cool stuff so
anyway folks I appreciate it I want you
guys to do one last thing for me okay I
like doing this after every livestream
at the end of every livestream I want
you guys to comment in the chat box with
your best emoji and I want you to do it
right now I don't care if you spam it no
one's gonna ban you or anything like
that but just spam it with an insane
emoji like just block it up I don't care
but I want to see them I want you to
flood the chat box and that's how we're
going to end the video the live stream
yes the live stream that's what this is
so give me your best emoji you'd be the
best shot and I'm gonna watch these
things roll in as we call it quits here
Asya Chris I see Chris
