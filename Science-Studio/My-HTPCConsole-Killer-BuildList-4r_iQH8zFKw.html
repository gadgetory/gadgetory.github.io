list of PC parts that were meant to
replicate a console in terms of its
specifications now this came at a cost
to performance which would not have
competed with consoles hadn't been
actually built all we had to go off of
was an APU just like the PlayStation 4
however consoles have their games
specifically designed around their
platform so optimization is key for
console games and that's how you can get
just a single APU with some Jaguar cores
and a Playstation 4 running a game at
1080p at 60fps
whereas for a PC having similar cpu
performance you wouldn't get those kinds
of results because those games aren't
optimized specifically for the AP use
that we chose in this video I'm not
going to run through each individual
part and tell you why I chose it but I
am going to direct you to the
description of this video so check out
the link below in that description it's
a PC part picker list that I put
together it's all based on us prices
things you can purchase specifically in
the US and it's it's a came out to about
five hundred twenty dollars so I
included all the parts that I chose for
the hardware side of things and I've
also included us at a peripheral so I
found a fifteen dollar Logitech keyboard
and mouse combo on Newegg and then also
an operating system now let me be a
little more specific about why I did the
operating system the way that I did it
in the parts list so instead of paying
eighty nine or ninety nine dollars for a
Windows 10 home operating system key
which i think is just outrageous I would
never pay that much for an operating
system what I did was hop on to ebay and
searched for Windows seven keys that I
could purchase from people who haven't
used them and I found quite a few
results that were very promising you see
some of them had already sold two or
three hundred units already so these are
basically the CDs and the keys that go
along with them and I think that these
should be considered over over this is a
regular Windows to not racism that's so
much money for an operating system when
you consider the fact that you could put
Linux on your computer for free or when
you could purchase one of these keys
from Windows 7 which
is upgradable for free to Windows 10 for
about half price so what I did was I
just included Windows 7 in the operating
system description of the PC part picker
list but then I just tacked on a manual
$50 price tag you might be able to find
operating systems for cheaper than that
maybe even a bit more expensive but I
think that $50 is a fair
middle-of-the-road
estimate for how much you should expect
to pay for an operating system on a
console killer of this caliber apart
from that be sure to let me know if you
personally feel like my PC part picker
list for this console killer PC is
adequate but I appreciate all
constructive criticism let me know what
you would like to replace things you
think that you could find better deals
for or you know appropriate substitutes
for maybe CPU coolers things like that
you could point out that you could
change maybe suggest an Intel based rig
instead of the AMD Athlon based rig that
I chose for this particular video in
this particular build I do expect to be
building an HD PC / console killer very
similar to this PC parts picker list in
the coming day so I'm expecting maybe a
week or two from now I'll be putting
these things together
I also have an i7 rig coming very soon
that I hinted at in the last video stay
tuned for both of those things but be
sure to check out the piece of quartz
bigger list in the video description
down below I think it's a great little
budget build it's not too expensive but
it's not too bare-bones either so you're
not making too many compromises although
there certainly are things that you
could choose just to opt out of
including the custom CPU cooler if
you're into hearing a louder fan or just
you know want to save that money and
invest it somewhere else maybe in a
nicer case or something of that sort be
sure to subscribe if you haven't already
like or dislike the video leave comments
let's talk about whatever you'd like to
talk about this is science studio thanks
