disclaimer I don't expect to cover
absolutely everything pertaining to
chipsets in this video and that's why I
titled it the way that I did I do expect
however to provide a detailed
description of what a chipset is to an
extent and why it matters in a system as
well as what kinds to look for in
various builds beginners especially pay
close attention here this video is
brought to you by privacy comm in a
nutshell privacy comm allows you to
purchase things online using virtual
debit card numbers instead of real ones
this is useful especially if you plan on
ordering some sites with questionable
security standards and it's still peace
of mind for the popular online retailers
like Amazon and Newegg privacy comm
boasts the same security standards as
your bank and split key encryption
ensures a no single person can access
your data by the way you can download
the browser extension and have it
autofill the info for any of your
virtual cards like this it's super
simple secure and best of all 100% free
since they make money on the merchant
side like that of credit card companies
you have to try via the link below or by
visiting privacy comm slash science
studio for a free $5 credit toward your
first purchase so let's start off by
defining a chip set and in this most
basic form a chip set with respect to
personal computers is a controller for
discrete and onboard hardware you see in
the good old days right simple chip sets
were scattered all across a motherboard
you had one for controlling your
graphics card one for controlling sound
and that's why they were so many to
begin with anything you'd want to
connect to your motherboard would
require a discrete chip the layouts took
up too much space pipelines weren't
streamlined and latency was actually
pretty high if the chipsets themselves
were clocked relatively low by the way
even today various companies produced
chipsets including nvidia AMD and intel
and it makes sense really for a majority
of these manufacturers to handle things
in house since chipsets need to be tuned
specifically for the hardware that
they'll be linking to and controlling
but things eventually merged on the IC
level into Northbridge and Southbridge
where the Northbridge connected via the
frontside bus and consisted of icy
sensitive to low latency tasks such as
the communication between a CPU and
system RAM for example or a graphics
card now the Southbridge which was
located much further down on the board
instead controlled SATA ports networking
audio and others you know basically less
sensitive aspects of a personal computer
things that weren't as time-sensitive
and we saw motherboards with North
bridges all the way up to the AMD FX
lineup whose am-3 and am3+ chipsets
maintained to both North and South
counterparts today however nearly all of
what a North Bridge typically handles is
controlled via the CPU which would
normally go up here North Bridge would
be somewhere in this space so memory
controllers for example are now totally
CPU integrated and started back with the
AMD 64 and Intel Nehalem processors in
fact Sandy Bridge was one of the first
CP families to fully integrate the
controllers of a typical North Bridge
which eliminated the need for one
altogether and also managed to pack the
memory controller IGP and several
processor cores all into a die that's
not much larger actually in the case of
Sandy Bridge a little smaller than the
service area of a quarter so you can see
the trend here technology's goal is to
minimize real estate and maximize
efficiency and today we've completely
absorbed large chunks of controllers and
integrated most if not all of them into
the CPU we're talking about the CPU die
specifically and that's why I use the
quarter analogy because what you're
looking at typically when you see a CPU
is the IHS or that large piece of metal
over the die itself so what about the
South Bridge well it's evolved just a
little bit and it's named different
things depending on who you ask which is
really annoying so intel calls there's
the IC H or the PCH it stands for i/o or
platform controller hub and AMD refers
to theirs as the F CH or a fusion
controller hub you'll almost never hear
these terms in PC tech though because
nobody really cares to separate them
they do very similar things so most
enthusiasts just refer to them as
chipsets or South bridges will call them
chipsets for the remainder of this video
just so you don't have to hear me keep
saying PCH and F CH so to recap the
South Bridge handles things like USB
controllers the audio interface the
internet connection it still does quite
a bit but these processes again aren't
typically as time-sensitive it
communicates with the CPU via the direct
media interface or the unified media
interface again very annoying
that's for Intel and AMD respectively
which were the same methods used by the
south and north bridges in the past by
the way speeds here are still pretty
quick somewhere in the realm of like a
Giga transfers per second per lane which
comes out to roughly four gigabytes per
second when four lanes are in use this
eliminates any potential bottleneck for
lower to your controllers like SATA
which currently cap out at around six
gigabits per second remember divided by
eight if you want to go from bits to
bytes bit confusing I don't blame you
for getting this mixed up and often
overlooked aspect by the way of PCH or
fch I should just be calling them chips
that's it's annoying is the control over
a few PCIe lanes so most of these slots
on your motherboard communicate directly
with either your CPU or your chipset in
the case of the CPU is an ultra-low
latent data tunnel between the discreet
Hardware and your CPU this is the beauty
of peripheral component interconnect
Express that's PCIe just wanted to sound
smart there but the chips that handles a
few lanes as well and again it depends
on the type of chipset that you have so
you could in theory connect PCIe storage
drives like nvme drives in this fashion
your motherboard manual will typically
denote which slot is controlled by the
chipset or which ones can be controlled
by it so you just have to remember that
you know if you add more devices to it
like hard drives SATA drives basically
any SATA Drive SSDs or even USB drives
to your system you'll be occupying some
of these chipset lanes by default so you
won't have some money to use or to
offload on to the PCIe lanes now on to
the hardware compatibility because you
understand the basics with respect to
communication between the chipset and
the CPU it makes sense to assume that
not all chipsets can coexist with
certain CPUs right for one you've got
the AMD Intel division obviously suck
it's aside I mean you can't run an intel
cpu with an AMD motherboard or vice
versa because we're talking about an AMD
chipset
so the protocols and instructions send
to and from the chipset in question are
essentially in different orders and
different languages per se so even if
you could power a modern intel chip with
say an AM for board which would be
really weird and extremely cool you
couldn't you know let's assume you could
also like retrace pin outs and so that
Ram compatibility with solid your
storage straps for one would have no way
to communicate with your CPU your BIOS
wouldn't either so you probably couldn't
get the system to boot it would
just power on so yeah as such here are
your modern consumer grid AMD chipsets
we're gonna go and roll under those what
I have right here is a thief or 50
motherboard meaning that there is a be
450 chips that packed underneath this
should we call it a heatsink
I think that's doing it more justice
than deserves it's like a it's basically
a metal plate it looks looks very nice
so you've got a 320 and be 350 B 450 X
370 and X 470 I'm ignoring enthusiast
grade hardware like the Red River in
this video I don't advise beginners to
begin their careers in PC tech with X 3
9 9 or x2 9 n systems most people won't
even utilize that many cores to begin
with by the way I may miss a few
derivatives here and there but these are
the ones that you're more likely to see
on sites like Newegg and Amazon all of
these chipsets are compatible with all
of these CPUs assuming you flash a
compatible bios more on that in this
video right here x3 and x4 70 chipsets
are the most expensive and
feature-packed by comparison so you'll
often see added compatibility for
crossfire and SLI for example a more
advanced onboard audio system and
additional storage drive support you'll
also typically see additional PCIe lanes
meaning you connect more drives and
other things to your motherboard without
having to cut into other lanes that
other hardware might already be using in
short the cheaper the board is the more
of these features you'll have stripped
from you in an effort to save costs on
both ends of the transaction that kind
of makes sense and for reference B and X
series chipsets in the case of AMD
support overclocking I've got a few
solid boards linked down below in the
video description that I first an
experience with if you are interested
next up is Intel you've got a CH 310 B
250 B 360 H - 7 th 370z 370 z 270 and z
390 yeah Intel's a slightly different
story and to be honest compatibility
isn't even guaranteed all the way
through this lineup so you can't just go
out and buy a 9 9 CPU and make it run on
a z170 board people have done in the
past it requires modding BIOS tweaking
but it's not advised and to be honest
the power load from a CPU like that
probably couldn't be handled by the
MOSFETs VRMs on a z1
because those chips were a lot less
intense when it came to power draw so
when you throw something that
power-hungry into it those can get
extremely hot run out of spec and then
you have even more substantial issues
further down the line so I recommend
with Intel sticking to boards that line
up directly with each other boards that
were released at the same time as their
cpu counterparts and this is gonna
require a bit of digging I could list
them all out for you but I have instead
linked one of Intel's chipset catalogs
down below in the video description so
it can give you an idea of what chipsets
can be used with which CPUs and unlike
AMD only Z series chipsets boast
unlocked multipliers or allow for unlock
multipliers so make sure you buy one of
these if you intend to purchase a case
series CPU again it can get confusing
but a site like PC part picker and
really help they're not a sponsored by
any means I just feel like giving you
all the help that you can get and PC
part pickers a great site it'll even
tell you if it detects incompatibility
and it suggests motherboards based on
your cpu choice and customer feedback it
will let you know if your motherboard
fits in a certain case it's a very
helpful website so again if you haven't
heard a PC port picker you're really
missing out click that link below and
yeah you'll thank me later
so in closing I hope you've at least
learn a thing or two about what chipsets
are and why they are so important you
know in the least maybe you just had a
quick refresher and I appreciate you
watching this part of the video pay
special attention to the chipsets when
selecting your next motherboard
especially you guys beginners and
purchase based on what you need in the
immediate future so when people ask me
you know which board should I get I
can't answer for you unless you give me
total context need to know if you care
about crossfire and SLI if you care
about 7.1 audio if you care about having
two rj45 boards to care about having
HDMI and DisplayPort outlets built into
the motherboard there are so many
variables at play and frankly the
chipset is just one of those things so
if we could actually make an entire
series out of talking about all the
different motherboard features but
chipsets are a big aspect of you know
choosing a motherboard so I want you
guys to I have at least a little bit of
context into why they're important and
why you should consider them when
deciding to build your next PC best of
luck to those who are watching this
video
have absolutely no idea what they're
gonna do what they're gonna build maybe
this is your first build ever I have
plenty of videos on the channel that can
help you out build guides all that stuff
and if you just want to know about why
things work the way they do we have an
entire playlist dedicated to yeah stuff
like that in-depth analyses and then if
you want more simplified stuff you can
check out our minute science playlist
you guys like this video thumbs up
thumbs down for the outs of feeling you
know what to do click that red subscribe
button if you haven't already and I'll
catch you in the next video this is
science city I think this will be our
last video for 2018 so that's pretty
cool happy 2019 everyone I'll see you
next year
alright let's do this little ovals this
is science studio thanks for learning
with us
looking good old fashioned out over
