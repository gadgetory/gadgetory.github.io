don't you love the way that my voice now
sounds get used to it this is the audio
technica 2035 XLR mic very mainstream
XLR microphone that's used by those who
run podcast by those who stream to
twitch things like that and I have it
picked up to a mixer here
the Yamaha mg 10x you the you mean that
has a USB interface for 192 kilohertz of
24-bit audio goodness that's actually
what you're not listening to right now I
just have this running from just the
stereo out so I have a left and a right
and those are running straight into the
back of my PC behind me and the audio is
still exceptional I mean this is this is
a huge jump from just the good old USB
interface that I was running with my
blue Yeti speaking of which yeah we we
had a loss from the family well it was
slowly dying I went ahead and pulled the
plug on it because a few of you who had
very good headsets were noticing that
there was a lot of white noise in the
background a lot of static especially
when I spoke I did my best using
audacity to kind of rule out that static
when I wasn't speaking but of course
when you do speak it's kind of hard to
get rid of those those white tones in
the audio so I went ahead and said
goodbye to it and invested in this gear
here about 350 or so US dollars for the
entire audio setup here not including
the PC Office or anything like that now
but if you want a decent audio setup
this is as far as I'm aware a great way
to go for those who are on a very strict
budget now the audio technica of 2035 by
this point speaks for itself it's a very
popular XLR microphone and that's why I
went with it because it is so reputable
in this space especially looking for an
entry-level XLR microphone that doesn't
break the bank this was only about 150
or so US dollars it is linked in the
description if you are curious if you
want to buy one for yourself I do get a
small kickback on Amazon I do say that
as much as I can I'm not trying to hide
anything it does help out though in the
long run but I want to spend the bulk of
my time in this video talking about the
Yamaha mg 10x you and I emphasize with
you because the USB interface is pivotal
if you want near perfect audio clarity
you don't have any static in the
background it's something that plagued
my old videos especially those who had
decent microphones I'll show you right
here here's a clip of what I sound like
with the blue Yeti USB version you can
hear that static in the background
that's not normal that wasn't there when
I originally bought the microphone I do
say that but it's been slowly dying on
me and at this point I'm just tired of
trying to edit it out and bother all of
you with the white noise so here's what
I sound like before this
okay this is a test of the blue Yeti now
my voice sounds a decent considering
this is a USB microphone but you can
hear that white noise in the background
that's usually edited out at least two
of the extent that I can with an
audacity so yes it's just not going to
cut it and for people to have very good
headsets at pay laws money for decent
audio you don't deserve something that's
dying like this and by this point you
already have a solid sample what I sound
like here now and I was speaking about
the same distance away from the blue
Yeti in that sample by the way so
another big reason why I chose this
setup here is because I can control a
lot of different things just on the
mixer itself without having to turn
around and do everything post-production
basically after I've already filmed and
recorded I have to edit everything after
the fact but here if I notice that
something's not sounding right
especially if I have headphones in which
you can do with this mixer I can control
all of that you have access to the highs
mids and the lows which is which is a
good selling point for me because a lot
of the cheaper mixers did not include
the mid calibration so you have access
to that across all four of these
channels and you can see I can tone down
the mid and I can tone up the mid right
here so yeah there's a fairly
substantial difference you can notice
the mids and that's why I wanted to buy
a mixer that had one now if you're
wondering why I chose the mixer with
four inputs I don't blame you because
you know I'm the only one here I don't
feed another three microphones plugged
in although I do have that access if I
need it so it's more of a future proving
thing for me I was willing to put a
minute but bit more money down just to
kind of solidify my content creation
status for the near future now I do plan
on doing this full-time when I get out
of here so this is a this is a pretty
solid investment I don't feel any
buyer's remorse at all I would probably
do it all over again at this point
because I am very pleased with the way
that my audio currently sounds now the
last thing want to talk about in this
video
really has nothing to do with what we do
here on the channel but it is cool to
have I guess you know whenever I want to
use this for something other than
YouTube I can just kind of carry this
mixer with me but there are 24 presets
on the sound effects side of the mixer
here on the right and these range from
everything from flanger to phaser to the
vocal echo delay
even got the Wawa walking oh that kind
of sound when you're playing if you play
guitar you know exactly what I'm talking
about you know a lot of different pedals
if you will built into this board which
is very nice because pedals are fairly
expensive especially if you go with
someone like boss which is my my pedal
choice now but you can basically cycle
through whatever you want all 24 of
these that's very easy to do I guess
we'll just kind of do one for the heck
of it I don't know if any of these are
going to sound decent let's do the auto
wah so 21 do I sound any different I
just think the best one to be using for
for just vocals here let's move it down
to vocal echo 13 I know you're going to
hear to conceive oh I bet I am very echo
8 who's not one you'd want to use in the
studio for anything other than probably
singing which I will not be doing on
this channel thank you very much let's
do one more form let's try the phaser I
bet this one sounds super cool like I'm
in a video game or something again I
don't know what this sounds like because
I don't have the headphones in but yeah
you have all of these built into the
board for your listening pleasure but
yeah this is a very cool setup I do
recommend it I have links to everything
that I purchased here in the video
description including you know the
smaller cheaper stuff like the arm stand
this is from knee wear this is a very
good arm stand that uses for the blue
Yeti as well when I bought another one
as well as the pop filter it's all there
check them out in the video description
let me know you think about the audio
game now versus how it was a couple
videos ago and we'll move on from here
using this setup if you liked the video
or just the investment give this one a
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
click to subscribe if you haven't
already now we'll catch you in the next
video this is Salazar studio thanks for
learning with this I love the way that
sounds
