the video to get 10% off your first

who wants a graphics card mounted
vertically in a case that doesn't
natively support vertical graphics card
mounting this guy look what he did and
it costs $0 and 0 cents so I had a lot
of fun with trying to get this GPU
mounted vertically and as I said in this
video it won't cost you a dime assuming
you have the one tool that is required
for altering the case a bit that one
tool a pair of diagonal cutters
something you would use to cut wire or
thin metal in this case just plastic and
aluminum are what comprise the chassis
and so it wasn't that difficult to use
these to cut through the aluminum in the
grille at the back of the case now
that's the only other thing you're gonna
need other than a graphics card that's
actually gonna fit if you have
especially large CPU cooler installed is
a bat grill with some open holes that
you can use to kind of wedge your
graphics card in there and that's why
this is a tool estab racket or anything
else at least not for this particular
case any case really that has these
small little holes at the back should be
good enough for mounting the graphics
card the way that I have in this case so
to get things started
I suggest lining up your affix card
roughly where you expect it to be when
it's all said and done so you want to
have enough space underneath the card
for the riser card over that's what's
gonna connect the graphics card to the
motherboard self you do need that with a
vertically mounted card so you have to
have one of those on hand but the actual
mod itself is not going to cost to
anything at all so when you have it
lined up roughly where you think it's
gonna be I suggest cutting out two slots
in the back grille that are gonna be
good for those little metal feet on the
back of the graphics card cut out just
enough room for those legs to squeeze
through that's really all you need to do
at the base of the grille now up top
you've got that 90-degree hinge that you
usually use to secure the graphics card
to a case that just has native
horizontal graphics card mounting you're
going to use those to kind of keep the
card upright so you're gonna use the 90
degree bend to let the card hang on the
chassis the trick though is finding a
way to mount that 90 degree bracket and
keep it on the grill it's gonna want to
fall this way right if you don't have
anything locking that hinge in place so
what I did was I cut the grille out and
I cut it in such a way that I allowed
the grille to be wrapped around some of
those small little areas that were cut
into that hinge so you can see how I
bent to areas in this grille
I ran them both one through the central
hole where one of the screws would go
and then also one at the top where the
second screw would go so I'm using those
to prevent the card from falling this
way and if you've got the feet properly
secured at the base this card really
shouldn't go anywhere it's pretty sturdy
as is and you can see it's really
retaining its original position it just
wants to be level and flat if you find
that the card is slightly hanging then
you can kind of just bend the grille a
little bit this this thing really isn't
going anywhere
connect your 8 pin 6 pin VGA cables
whatever you have up top and remember to
connect the riser card which is really
the only purchase necessary but the
actual mod like I said is free you can
do this with one tool and then your card
should be working fine oh and don't
forget to cut out a few slots at the
back for your HDMI or DisplayPort
connections those obviously needed as
well just to take those diagonal cutters
cut a few slots out and voila there you
go a vertical graphics card mount and
the mod itself costs literally nothing
now if you're wondering about
temperatures this is a blower style card
so all the air is pulled in through this
opening here and it's being forced out
the back of the card now with the front
panel being literally about two or so
centimeters from the opening and the
graphics card you might be wondering how
temperatures are faring this way versus
if you just mounted it horizontally and
this graph here shows you the Delta so
between the two actually had a two
degree increase for the GPU temperature
with the card mounted vertically not you
know super substantial I don't think
that it's going to deter anyone from
wanting to do this keep in mind that
this is a blower style card like I said
so if you have a car that's you know
cooled with three fans it's an aib card
then temperatures may vary slightly but
this isn't gonna absolutely choke your
graphics card that's not what's gonna
happen here in fact with fans in the
front you're still gonna have pretty
solid air flow moving through the card
anyway even if these fans up the front
aren't getting much air so maybe
overcompensate with the front fans and
you should be fine now at this point you
might be thinking to yourself Greg I
don't know if I want to take the risk
here I mean you cut it and it looks fine
with the card there but if I cut mine
and it doesn't turn out well and my car
doesn't mount the way that you mounted
yours I'm just gonna have an ugly hole
at the back of my case and yeah that's
the risk that you're incurring here but
I would say I mean you're gonna be
looking at your case either from the
side or from the
and you can't really tell how I cuts up
and from the back it looks pretty rough
not gonna lie I didn't bother shaving
the edges the sharp metal edges there
but it doesn't look bad from the front
and I'd say that yeah I would do this
again for sure in a case that I knew was
compatible with this method look sure
you can go out and buy a proper two slot
graphics card bracket to mount
vertically you could Dremel through your
case and make it look nice and pretty
but you can't really see the dirt from
the back of the case unless you're at
the back of the case which would be a
weird orientation anyway most people
look at the case from the front and from
the side and from both I think it looks
pretty good and this mod only took me
about ten minutes so if you're looking
for a quick and dirty solution I say
this is the way to go assuming you have
a case that supports this cutting method
here you gotta have some kind of mesh
metal grille at the back of your case
and you should be able to pull off
something like this with a simple tool
if you at least like the effort or like
the idea be sure to let me know by
