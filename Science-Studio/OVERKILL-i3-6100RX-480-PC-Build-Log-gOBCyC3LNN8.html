up soon folks I have a lot of data that
I need to compile and I can't progress
any further than I already have
until all that sorted out so stay tuned
for that but for now hopefully to
suffice I have an I three 6100 PC built
to show off to you I built this one well
actually my friend built this one almost
entirely by himself I was just kind of
filming I like doing that kind of thing
I've done that before on the channel
he's never built a PC before so I'd like
showing people Hey look this isn't
really that hard it looks complex but
it's it's not and that's that's pretty
much what he figured out at the end of
this so enjoy this one
all right so this is Destin's first time
ever building PC I love doing these
kinds of builds just kind of filming and
watching other people do this it reminds
me of my first time too
and the only only part you'll need is
the CPU itself so the fan you can just
kind of throw off to the side there she
is and all her glory right
you're gonna put her in so this hinge
right here push that down and over yep
and then just go ahead and lift it up
there you go
okay now you're see if he's gonna rest
right in there I was wondering if you
were gonna figure it out the first time
no other way keep going
there you go set it right in there good
job alright go ahead and close it back
and then just like that and then now
it's gonna take some force don't be
afraid keep going keep going that's okay
keep going
and then tuck her underneath it's always
a scary part alright you just installed
a CPU Destin yeah yeah all right CPUs
installed next I guess we can tackle the
RAM so four dims each of these holds
four gigs of DDR 4 so we ramp it all
four of them into all four of the slots
here and the only thing you got to make
sure that you do is line up the notch
here with the notch on each of the dims
all right now take both corners and push
very hard perfect just like that and
then do the rest do the same thing for
the other three I like that red on red
action got going on mom man I win so
hard now was it
yeah that's pretty much like half your
build right there let's go ahead and
tackle the case issue we have an
anodized AI crystal that's a tempered
glass case so go ahead and haul that
thing over here oh yeah
I'll tell you what put on a cheer
I just pissed off everybody else
downstairs
it ain't light is it alright so this is
a cracking x61 from NZXT 280 millimeter
all-in-one radiator combo wondering why
the heck were water cooling an i3 6100
well my friends he'll find out very soon
yeah so we're going to keep those in
there all four of them and then now this
this is going to be a difficult part so
this has to go up there there you go
oh the screw off no idea oh okay so
radiator secure it up top and just kind
of chilling right now so let's go ahead
install the power supply next all we
have to do is just insert this into the
back of the PC like so and then secure
it on the front here okay so next time
we reinstall is this armor 240 gig
solid-state drive from a pacer this is
going to be our only form of storage in
the build but seeing as though we have
three spaces upgrade SSDs and then also
hard disk drive bay down there which you
can also install SSDs in we're gonna
plenty of room to upgrade should we ever
need to but fry now 240 is plenty here
you go okay
looking good all right sweet so we had a
lot of the small stuff already out of
the way I guess what we can do next is
merge the motherboard to the case are
you ready sir great ok got our back
plate for the g3 that's for you I guess
I'll take I'll take that I'm gonna put
this go put it yeah all right so it's
gonna take some force I say that
everybody who helps build pcs is like a
stubborn part right here so you're gonna
put it just like that into here next
thing go ahead and grab the motherboard
behind you and now you're going to
orient it in the case in such a way that
the peripherals here on the back
aligned with the i/o shield and in a way
that this Center little stand up that's
the one I use anyway goes right there
goody
hain't bed and then it perfect so let's
get the motherboard screws hold out
there real quick oh hey that's so much
better
that's so much better make sure the NZXT
logo is facing up so just the same way
the writing is and you're gonna slide
each of those hinges no no the turn turn
it that way
okay well mmmm-hmmm
like like that perfect just like that
okay so we have the a gigabyte AMDR x
480 here this is a reference cooler and
star destin you go good move that cable
up your way oh whoops I had it yep so
you're gonna want them it'll stay on the
backside of it
yep but you're gonna want to just
basically insert it yeah there you go
you did it
alright destiny got the graphics card
installed now we need to power it so
look for a six plus two pin power
connector in the back and see if you can
find folks don't make me come back there
no no it's already plugged into the
power supply so weave that through here
so go ahead and just connect that one
straight up there it is okay so that's
installed what else are we looking for
your 24 pin and the eight pin up top
cool it's all black and the last one is
the eight pin it's gonna say CPU on it
it's gonna funnel up through this whole
top okay we skip the wire because that's
boring and tempered-glass time okay back
panel secured and they go ahead and flip
it around let's go ahead and install the
front panel and we will call it a day
all right
it's so like the tint is so dark you
can't even see the inside
I mean without lights in there so these
four fans have LEDs and then so does our
cooler and the front oh yeah power cable
right here
I have big plans for this PC believe it
or not I plan on overclocking the i3
6100 using the base clock method which
you can still do video right here to
verify that it is four months old but I
still have computers that are running
just fine with the base clock overclock
still active so you can check that video
out or you can stay tuned for the next
video to follow this one and in that
video I'll show you how to do it again
just to verify that it is still possible
so if you don't want to buy a case QC P
which is considerably more expensive
than the non K counterpart and you can
opt for rather than a three or an i-5
non K processor and overclock it using
this method there are a few compromises
you have to you have to make in order to
do that but in the long run I think
it'll be worth saving the extra dough I
mean who doesn't want to save dough
right so stay tuned for that stay tuned
for part 4 the CPU core series if you
like this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
do feel the queen opposite or if you
hate everything about life be sure to

already stay tuned for well the two
videos I just mentioned this is science
studio thanks for learning with us
