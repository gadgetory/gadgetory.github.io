littered with misinformation in regards
to topics like the one in this video
for example this GameSpot threads Opie
asking whether he can see 100 FPS on a
75 Hertz display receive responses like
it's true and you can't see 100 FPS
anyways here's another LCDs do not have
refresh rates they have response times
but what really happens when more frames
and the monitor can process are sent
from the GPU and what is screen tearing
on a technical level and how does vsync
solve this issue
welcome to probably a very long episode
of minute science every point zero one
six seven seconds or thereabout sir
point zero zero eight three seconds or
point zero zero four two seconds your
monitor likely refreshes these are
refresh rates adopting the unit Hertz
the SI unit of frequency denoted as the
multiplicative inverse of seconds so
when a monitor has a 60 Hertz refresh
rate it switches images or stills 60
times per second frames are usually
drawn from top to bottom at speeds our
eyes are incapable of discerning and are
left on screen for a duration of 1 / the
refresh rate itself but what happens
when you send more than the number of
frames a screen can process what happens
when a 60 Hertz monitor let's say
receives 100 frames per second on
average from a graphics card and no I'm
not just talking about screen tearing
that's the obvious answer I want to know
what happens on a technical level inside
the monitor well if we assume a constant
60 Hertz refresh rate like with this
monitor here and a constant 90 FPS draw
from the graphics card then we're at a
roughly 121.5 deficit on the GPU side
meaning half of every other frame won't
be processed by the monitor at least on
paper now in the real world monitors
only call frames when they need them so
the very first frame at these ratios
with a perfectly fine once the
simulation starts one frame sent and one
frame displayed but since the monitor
isn't refreshing fast enough the next
image displayed will consist of only
half of the next full frame you can look
at this mathematically by separating
each rate in additive steps using our
ratio one plus one plus one for the
monitor and one point five plus one
point five plus one point five for the
GPU again
constant framerate on the second refresh
from the monitor when it's step is to
the graphics card is already halfway
through its second frame so the monitor
compensates by displaying half of the
second frame and the first half of the
third in this scenario since the other
half of the data from the previous frame
was overridden by the graphics cards
higher pace if it didn't override the
previous frame the video would become
delayed increasing input lag to the
degree that this was allowed to continue
at step three the graphics card will be
sending its fourth frame because they're
in sync again and then the cycle repeats
it goes out of sync by a half step and
then it's back in sync and it keeps
alternating now the yield what we get
from that is what we call screen tearing
and it literally looks like the screen
is being torn down the middle but I
should clarify where it's torn depends
largely on the refresh to FPS ratio at
that time in this particular example
everything's on a 1 to 1.5 ratio so the
monitor would ideally split every other
frame perfectly across the center and
something else to note screen tere
occurs horizontally because frames are
usually drawn in a top-to-bottom fashion
now this is where vsync comes in when
enable that forces the graphics card to
literally synchronize its frame rate the
frames that it's outputting to the
monitor with the calls from the monitor
it'll also typically reduce hardware
utilization but this isn't foolproof so
you might notice a temperature drop or
maybe the fans spool down just a little
bit but this is more or less a byproduct
of using vsync in the event that you
would normally have a much higher frame
rate being thrown to the monitor now
there may be visual benefits to running
at a frame rate higher than your refresh
rate even though technically speaking
you can't see those extra frames so many
professional FPS gamers in particular
keep vsync off because they swear by the
decreased input lag and faster
interpolations required when aiming
here's what an overwatch player had to
say in any case I disabled the vsync
recently and wow what a difference
I can aim now I always had this issue
where I'd be tracking a target like a
running soldier and my crosshair would
always lag a tiny bit behind where they
were I always thought this was just some
practice or mental block issue where I
hadn't trained my hand-eye coordination
to compensate or something now it
doesn't happen any
or I have a couple of friends who have
reported the same feeling it's such a
tiny one sixtieth of a second delay it's
hard for your brain to realize it's not
the one making the mistake my wife
swears by vsync off despite the
occasional screen tearing and I can kind
of see why but at higher refresh rates
these advantages become less apparent in
principle so at 60 Hertz the maximum
delay incurred with vsync on would
approach one sixtieth of a second right
in time for the next frame to be in sync
with the refresh rate but at 240 Hertz
the max delay with vsync is 1 to 40th of
a second which could make a visual
difference to many though the
effectiveness of vsync at these rates
anyway is probably pretty moved
so in summary extra frames are
overridden or split in accordance with
the refresh rate in question but with
vsync on the graphics card draws as many
frames as the monitor calls so no
splitting or screen tearing is necessary
maybe only a slight delay that I don't
expect too many people would notice
except maybe those who play and on a
professionally or really intense
first-person shooters I don't know what
you think about this topic in the
comments below if you play with vsync on
or off we haven't really touched on
freesync or g-sync which are proprietary
technologies from AMD and both more
proprietary for nvidia on the g-sync
side but those technologies are for a
separate video I just wanted to
highlight vsync here because almost
anybody has access to that as long as
you're playing a relatively modern game
you can turn on the vsync function or
the you know 1x 2x or 3x buffer which
would basically store those frames in
your graphics cards memory kind of a
similar process to vsync just call it
something different on paper so if you
like the video you can let me know give
someone a thumbs up I appreciate it
