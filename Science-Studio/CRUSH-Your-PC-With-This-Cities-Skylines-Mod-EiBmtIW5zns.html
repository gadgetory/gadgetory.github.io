bit of fun I'm going to show you one of
my favorite games that city skylines and
how you can cripple your system
literally bring it to its knees with one
simple mod now that mod can be found in
the Steam Workshop for city skylines I
love the creator support there there are
so many things you can add to this game
it's one of the reasons why I keep
playing it because I might get tired of
a certain theme or a certain you know
design I can get tired of a map I can
download more many people are adding
stuff to that workshop every day it's
it's just one of my favorite games to
play because there are so many
opportunities and it's kinda like a
sandbox game you know you're kind of the
controller of your own destiny and I
like that kind of stuff that's why I
like the roller-coaster tycoon series
Sim City you get the point but anyway
the mod I'm going to show you in this
video I've linked down below if you play
City skylines I encourage you to try
this out yourself we're gonna open up
system usage as well by MSI Afterburner
we have a video talking about how to get
all that setup as well if you're
interested in scanning your system and
trying to find the bottleneck although I
have a feeling in this case everything
will be the bottleneck
Thermal Grizzlies carbonate pads offer
peace of mind ease of installation and
industry standard performance in a
market crowded with mediocre thermal
compounds our own testing confirms that
they conduct heat appropriately and
provide a safe and consistent membrane
between the dire IHS and cooler best of
all you can grab them in several sizes
and reuse them as many times as you'd
like
Carbonite pads are a peace of mind in my
book and they're very consistent and
that's why I use them for CPU testing
check them out via the link below and
the model were gonna be focusing on in
this video is called ultimate level of
detail again it's linked in the video
description for those interested and
this effectively increases or decreases
depending on how you set it the loading
distance for certain things in the game
like trees buildings networks you can
imagine when you have a really big city
and you're trying to load all this stuff
from a very far distance like if you
zoom all the way out then you can really
tax your system so the four toggles will
be messing with our tree level of detail
distance set to default right now for 25
prop level of detail distance 1000
building distance 1000 Network 1000 so
networks are like roads bridges train
tracks things of that sort buildings
pretty self-explanatory props are
smaller objects in the game and then
trees again pretty self-explanatory
trees are actually by default set fairly
low by comparison because there are so
many trees in the game and they very
sharp edges they move in the wind and
that can be very taxing on a system but
you can see we can race this all the way
up to ya 10,000 meters in the developer
who says good luck and then 100,000
meters goodbye alright so you can see
this is City skylines and I am actually
building what's supposed to be Taipei
although apart from the topography it
really looks nothing like Taipei this is
just an honor of Computex coming up
again this year and at to the left you
can see system usages GPU usage GPU
memory right here sis's vram we have
CPUs 1 through 16 these are all 16
threads in the 99 hundred km sporting
I'm also using an RT X 20 80 for those
wandering system Ram here you can see we
have 16 gigs in total using about
two-thirds of that at the moment and
then our frame rate so to write x11
about 40 mid 40s and then you see when
we zoom in and we get up close and
personal here that framerate drops
substantially down to about 25 or so and
I'm ok with this like I don't I don't
expect this to run at 100
200 FPS that'd be awesome but most of
the time I'm just you know unlocked onto
a certain position and I'm like building
roads or doing something I'm not moving
a lot while I'm building so the frame
rate in this particular game is not as
important to me as the level of detail
hence the mod we have installed so what
I'm going to do now that you've seen the
frame rate with stock level of detail
distances is bump that distance
dramatically using the level of detail
tool let's just do let's just do
buildings let's try that first so I'm
gonna go from 1000 meters screw it
10,000 meters let's see what happens
okay
and I'm gonna back out and now we're at
8f PS that was the one toggle folks I'm
not even zoomed dag now when we zoom out
even further right now it's having to
account for many more buildings and our
frame rate is about 5 fps so yeah our
CPU usage has gone up a little bit you
can see it's fluctuating but a lot of
these threads are not being utilized
much at all again look at thread 12 like
5% 15% back to 6% 15% back to 5% CEMA
thread 14 thread 16 seems to be doing
that thread for up here I saw was pretty
low thread 6
I thought 30 FPS was bad but I actually
kind of appreciate it now I don't think
I'm ever gonna feel as excited to see 40
FPS as I will after I turn all this crap
off so I know this is gonna be choppy
but just to show you exactly what we're
manipulating I have a bunch of dead
people living here oh my gosh you can
see if we get up close this buildings
level of details pretty much maxed out
for this game and we're going to zoom
out now and normally that level of
detail would diminish as distance
between the camera and that building
increases but since we've adjusted that
scale distance now it is well - the
pixelation that's you know I'm just the
screens fault that building is in full
detail as we zoom out to pretty much max
distance and that's what's taxing this
system rather the game I mean are you
can see our video memory here it's about
7800 megabytes
that's not technically maxed it's pretty
close though and that could be one of
the
why this game is performing so poorly
right now so the last thing I'm gonna do
is bump up every level of detail draw
distance - let's just do max screw it
100,000 meters can we get zero FPS I'm
pretty sure this entire games gonna
crash
I can't even click on the setting there
we go yep we're at 1 FPS - we're in the
menu and we're getting 1 fps let's move
this one up just for good measure
to 100,000 it's like if I even can there
we go this is extremely delayed alright
prop level of detail distance growing
down ever so slowly and now everything
is maxed out goodbye goodbye goodbye
goodbye let's see if we can click out of
the menu alright and I'm rotating right
now you're seeing this at 1 fps and part
of the game isn't even loading
that's weird I've never seen that before
you can see over here these buildings
aren't even loaded that's possibly a vrm
issue it's just not able to load enough
into video memory so it's trying to do
it on demand and when I rotate the you
know angles of the buildings change and
kind of freaks out the whole system
looks like we're good now let's try to
zoom in over there now it's completely
gone let's try to zoom it this is where
it's gonna get really bad Oh
2 FPS let's see if we can just watch
some cars on the Wow I can't even if I
click like a or D on the keyboard to
move left to right it just skips so much
is gonna give me a headache you see we
have a few CPU threads here like CPU
thread 3 is pretty high 74% 62% now some
of these are pretty high but some of
these are like zero like like thread 15
was like 0 a second ago all these
threads are very low in terms of usage
so definitely not a CPU bottleneck our
system memory or excuse me our video
memory is still pegged at around 70
hundred megabytes I don't expect it to
go much higher than that I don't think
it really can but our GPU usage is 28%
30% right now now looking too good but
it's not
Buse fault I would say this is probably
a video memory issue which is there's
just not enough of it and also just an
optimization issue the game just doesn't
know how to properly utilize the
hardware at its disposal this can be
broken down into several factors I would
say the fact that the engine itself is
just not prepared for the the stacks of
hardware that we could potentially throw
at this game the fact that our graphics
card came out significantly later then
this game did and I mean developers can
they can do a little bit but they really
don't want to change the entire
framework of the game because then that
ruins all the mods that all these
creators have published in the workshop
and it's annoying when cities publishes
some you know software update that
totally renders mods like these useless
and then that could potentially ruin the
save state of progress in the city so
there are reasons why they keep it this
way I mean I don't think they expect
people to completely max out levels of
detail distance but that is it we're
we're at one FPS and I'm gonna call it
this system just it's just it's not fit
for this game city skylines has
effectively crushed this pc yeah that
was fun what do you think Pepsi that's
pretty fun right
I would pick her up she'll probably bite
me should I do it I'll do it there we go
okay I say head to the camera she's
actually been pretty true right now like
that okay she's not one of those kids
that likes to be held
unfortunately anyway that's City
skylines for you like the game itself
runs fine and it's never been a game
that I've gotten to run over like 100
FPS especially in high or very high
presets but there's a lot of stuff you
can do to it and some of the things out
there like this level of detail Oh will
crush your system and look we're running
a really nice system here right 9900 Kay
it's no slouch from the best gaming CPUs
in the market RTX 2080 again no slouch
we were limited by our veer and we were
also limited by the game itself just not
being able to utilize the hardware at
its disposal that's again comes down to
the engine comes down
the developers when they change a lot of
stuff in a game or they just push out
some totally new framework it renders a
lot of these mods useless and the entire
workshop for the most part and it falls
apart people get really pissed off as
they worked really hard on a city that
has a lot of mods in it and now they
can't even load into their game because
their mods don't work anymore so it's
understandable I still enjoy the game
even at 30 or 40 fps and look a lot of
that is because of the mods that I've
put into the game which the initial
developers really didn't you know intend
to be used by a ton of people else they
would have thrown those things into the
game in the first place right so it's
nice that we have that support and again
if this is something you want to try I
mean good luck you may think you have a
system that can handle it let me know in
the comments below how that goes you can
find a link to that toggle that mod in
the video description along with the
game itself if you're interested in
buying city skylines I play it again
just in my pastime very fun game kind of
like a sandbox game and you can just be
creative that's really the point of it
you guys like this video thumbs up you
know what to do I can just feel through
everything you guys have been awesome I
will catch you in the next one this is
science studio thanks for watching and
thanks for learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
