the be quiet dark rock pro4 in the
studio now I have benchmarked this with
a 5820k and 16 gigs of RAM I tried to
keep the platform consistent I don't
think it matters as much what CPU we're
using as long as we have a baseline and
as long as we keep our tests consistent
so I didn't want to just throw one set
of graphs at you right with just this
cooler without anything else with which
to compare so that's why this video took
a while to produce I wanted to test this
thing put it head-to-head against
something like the Noctua an HD 15 which
is another beefy air cooler comparable
to this one the size and TDP a couple of
a iOS and also a few smaller air cooler
just so you get an idea of what you're
getting for your money so without
further ado let's go ahead and talk
installation and then we'll get into
those thermals now to be clear the dark
rec pro 4 makes no substantial cooling
performance jump from the DRP 3 both are
250 watt TDP s the big thing be quiet
outing with this one is the installation
it has been vastly improved from what
they're saying and we got a glimpse of
it at CES but we'll see in our own
testing if that in fact is the case the
new RP 4 has an MSRP of about a hundred
USD it might be slightly lower than that
in some cases we'll keep a look out you
can find the product link in the video
description if you want to check it out
after watching this video but I want you
to watch this video because after
installing it running my tests there are
a few things that you should know before
you just jump on the bandwagon and
purchase the improved dark rock pro 4
we're still stuck with the same 250 watt
TDP again perfectly fine for an air
cooler it's not it's not issue 7 large
copper heat pipe spanning from the base
up through some black ceramic coated
fins good for heat dissipation and you
do get two silent wings three fans one
is 135 millimeters in diameter and the
other 120 the larger fan sits between
the two heat sinks this is where it
belongs because the smaller fan upfront
means that you won't have as many RAM
clearance issues all right now I want to
talk ease of installation at this point
because this is something that be quiet
touted especially at CES and I don't
want to say it was kind of misled but I
didn't know the full story because I
didn't actually install anything myself
they had the Phillips head screwdriver
that is included by the way with the
purchase of the cooler it's a very
elongated one it's magnetic which is a
good thing you
no why here in a second but the
installation process is slightly it's
held back by a few design flaws that I
want to point out especially you know if
they want to take this criticism to
heart implement this in the next
generation you guys will you'll see what
I mean in a second so the holes that
they've drilled here these are the new
holes that were supposed to make the
installation much easier right you can
thread the Phillips head screwdriver
down and then secure the cooler to your
socket with just two Phillips head
screws well that's fine and dandy but
the problem is the only thing that fits
through these holes is two Phillips head
screw driver the screws themselves are
too wide at the head so you actually
have to hold the screw underneath the
plate and then somehow get that magnetic
screwdriver to grip into the threads
perfectly at which point you can secure
the cooler to the socket I found them
especially when building in a case it
was very difficult to get that top screw
to thread into the Phillips head
screwdriver
you know poking through the cooler what
they should have done was widen the
holes a little bit so you don't have to
hold the screw underneath the
screwdriver it just it makes things so
much easier I actually drop the spear a
few times had to flip my case around
very frustrating to get that screw back
out so if they widen the holes and then
the other thing is because these holes
line up perfectly with the fan that
would otherwise be here that I removed
for the purposes of filming this segment
of the video you have to remove the fan
and you have these stupid you know a
little metal hinge things that are a
pain to get off you have to I almost
have to use like a prying tool I can't
even do it with my fingers it you know
and you're bending the the fins when you
do that I've already you can see I've
already cut a few of them just by trying
to pry off the middle fan it just holds
this cooler back if this coolers ease of
installation was improved dramatically
like I expected it to be
you know they touted this cooler as a
massive improvement of the D rp3 then
there would literally be no other
competition out there I think it already
looks the best it performs admirably
we'll get to that in a second but the
ease of installation is just not there
yet so I'm definitely a little
disappointed with the fact that be quite
it's almost taken a sidestep here it's
an improvement over the dr p3 you know
getting at it from the bottom and trying
to secure everything underneath near the
heat pipes was a royal pain with a dark
rock pro 3
but the dr p4 really didn't expedite
things much in the way of you know how
long it took for me to install the
cooler i still found new problems
especially doing it the first
I'm around it just it wasn't ideal make
the hole slightly larger move them into
the heatsinks and then boom you've got a
perfect cooler all around for the price
I'm waiting on that cry work does it
really well rip cry rig off you guys and
then you've got an excellent cooler in
the Dr p5 revision now on to cooling
potential and its sound both of these
are really important we look for an air
cooler you don't want it to be loud but
you do want it to cool your CPU very
well now the way that we've kept things
pretty mainstream and baseline here was
I use the exact same fan curve for every
fan in the case it will remain that way
for all the other coolers you'll see
tested in this video and so it's just a
normal fan curve it's a normal preset
when you go into the hardware monitor
fan utility and that average is around
40 to 50 percent utilization for each
fan so that varies per fan especially
when they're PWM controlled you know 50
percent for one fan might be slightly
higher lower in terms of rpm than
another fan that's a little bigger and
so that's something you need to take
into consideration and you're also gonna
be hearing the case fans when you hear
you know the overall sound of the cooler
that's something that I don't want to I
don't want to not include that because
it's the whole system right that you
should be considering for something like
this so we're gonna start first with the
audible tests and then we'll jump into
thermals so the first test was at idle
and these coolers always impressed me
from be quiet it was virtually inaudible
about 20 decibels which is and that's a
whisper practically and then when things
heated up and around 64 65 degrees
Celsius under load under full load
without a 64 on the CPU side that things
really didn't pick up that much at all
around 25 dB so I'm going to keep and
keep in mind though you know the the
loudness of these coolers is gonna be
based on the fan curve so if we use a
much smaller cooler now that doesn't
keep temperatures as low then the fan
curve will peak in a much higher
utilization for those fans right around
80 90 percent so the system will get
hotter and then the system will get
louder as a result that's okay though
because we're still being consistent if
the cooler can keep things as cool as it
is you know if this one in particular
keeps things under let's say 65 degrees
Celsius then it deserves to be quieter
and it deserves recognition for that
because it is doing an adequate job
dissipating heat so that's what this
test will revolve around
so just to recap again that is 20
decibels at idle and then a mere 26
decibels
under
full load again full load for the CPU
not necessarily the cooler unless you're
doing some severe overclocking this
cooler should never approach one or two
percent fan and utilization
now on to the temperatures you'll see
both idle and low temps again this is
not full load for the fans and the
coolers this is just full load for the
CPU under i-264 conditions the CPU by
the way is running its stock speed so I
think things turbo to around 4 gigahertz
for the 5820k but as long as things stay
consistent across all coolers it's
really all we care about here the deltas
are what truly matter in relation to the
price of each so the DRP 4 stayed nice
and cool at around 33 degrees Celsius
the idle the AI was across the board
were slightly cooler at idle but this is
probably because the liquid inside the
loops hadn't actually equalized anything
higher than room temperature by this
point but under full load this is where
the dark rock pro 4 shines so not only
was it the quietest of all the coolers
tested here apart from the nokju and HD
15 which was arguably about the same the
in HD 15 was slightly more audible in
the sense that the the tones and the
fans were slightly louder the silent
wings three fans in the dark pro four
are slightly bass here there they have a
lower tone now it really depends on
which you were more receptive to but
both coolers are extremely quiet in
their own respects and both cool about
the same the dark rock pro 4 is actually
slightly cooler in this respect and I
think that might have to do with the
positioning of the fans
so the DRP 4 is fans on the cooler lined
up perfectly with the fans in the case
both of the front and rear so airflow
you know in and out of the case was
pretty much as optimal as it could get
so very cool and quiet here just twenty
six decibels that's practically a
whisper and then 65 degrees Celsius at
the highest temperature core core free
for some reason was was peaking every
now and then above the others but
nonetheless that's the one we took
because it was the hottest across all
six of them and again 65 degrees is
nothing that's plenty of overclocking
Headroom we could have easily pushed
this thing to may be 4.3 4.4 gigahertz
and for 5820k that's pretty impressive
especially for an air cooler one other
thing to note regarding our testing I
was sure to use the thermal paste
included with each cooler respectively
so the knock to a cooler are used to the
knock do with a whole paste included in
the box
be quiet cooler used to be quiet thermal
paste and so on and so forth I would cry
ever get seven in here I used the cryo
rig thermal paste in that box and that's
because I don't expect the consumer to
have you know seven or eight there
compounds laying around you might use
just one thermal compound it might not
be any of these listed but it does keep
things consistent and it influences and
encourages these manufacturers to throw
the best thermal compound they can into
their boxes so as to minimize you know
variances and temperatures so my verdict
on the be quiet dark rock Pro 4 is
surprisingly almost the same verdict
that I had with the dark Rock Pro 3
things slightly improve of the
installation side of things and that's
really about it the cooler looks as good
as it did in the previous generation it
cools about the same as the previous
generation did and it's also extremely
quiet it's got three of the four major
components for an air cooler going for
it I just wish that the ease of
installation was was there it's really
not yet it's improved but if you have a
dark rock pro 3 you know you're
perfectly fine even if you have
something that's comparable TDP wise it
doesn't look as good you're probably
best just stick in with that if you're
building a new PC for the first time and
you want to go with air cooling then I
still do strongly recommend the dark
rock pro 4 you're not gonna have as
difficult the time installing the cooler
you're gonna be impressed with the way
it looks in your case you're gonna be
impressed with how quiet it is and how
cool it keeps your CPU so you know this
still a cooler I recommend it's just not
everything I thought it would be be
quiet probably doesn't want to hear that
but I have to be honest I expected more
they touted the installation process of
being so much easier and for me anyway
it just wasn't unless I'm completely
misunderstanding the installation manual
which by the way is pretty it's pretty
straightforward if you have you know am
4 or C 370 or even x-29 9 it's very
straightforward how to install the
cooler thanks to the manual if you
haven't done to this sort of thing
before so it's nice that they included
that and in several languages too I was
surprised by how many different
languages they had in the box with that
again you can find the links to this
cooler and it's be quite dark route pro
3 counterpart in the video description
if you want to leave a comment
suggesting future comparisons between
this and other air coolers do that in
the comments below I'll be sure to check
those out as well if you like this one
be sure let me know give this one a
thumbs up I appreciate it thumbs down
