electrons and protons we call plasma
where the former would normally orbit
the latter in this case billions and
billions of them move freely around in a
dense hot climate and we aren't talking
desert hot try 15 million degrees
Celsius and it's important because
temperatures and pressures this high
allow free-roaming protons to reach a
critical speed you see protons are
positively charged and as such naturally
repel each other thanks to the column
force that's also called the
electromagnetic force think of identical
magnetic poles being squished together
right there's a repelling force there
and it's the same principle with protons
but when trillions of psi and millions
of degrees Celsius or mixed in protons
smash into each other by managing to
overcome the column force instead
succumbing to the nuclear force and
stars around the size of our Sun this
proton proton collision ultimately
drives the fusion process that warms our
planet when one proton smashes into
another a few things happen first one of
the protons in the new deuterium nucleus
becomes a neutron this is actually a
rare event typically the two fused
protons just decay back into separate
particles without anything else
happening but enough deuterium is
produced every second to sustain the
chain reaction inside our star and we'll
assume that's what's happening here
so at this point two smaller particles
are yielded a positron and a neutrino
and a process called beta plus decay the
previously positive charge of the
converted neutron is transferred to the
smaller positron which is an electron
with a positive charge instead of a
negative one the other particle a
neutrino is an electron with no charge
at all the positron will almost
immediately collide with an electron
yielding two gamma rays which are hyper
charged light particles gamma rays are
the things that cause cancer by
penetrating and breaking down cellular
DNA it's bad as for the neutrinos well
you're being bombarded with billions of
those every second but they rarely
interact with nature so you don't have
to worry they're very small and they are
neutral hence the name neutrino now back
to our deuteron within seconds it fuses
with another proton creating helium-3 or
helium a gamma ray is also released with
a significantly higher energy state in
the previous reaction and at this point
helium-3 must become helium four somehow
so yeah it gets dicey the problem is
that there are several ways to make
for so we'll discuss the two most common
methods method one involves two helium
nuclei as long as temperatures are
somewhere in the range of 10 to 12
million Kelvin they're able to smash
into each other and yield helium 4 along
with 2 protons and a ton of energy the
process takes around half a millennium
to play out most of the time which is
kind of hard to fathom and that's
because a single proton will typically
smash into Helion and then decay
immediately again that disrupts the
process between two helium atoms and
their way more protons inside the Sun
there are Helion or helium atoms so then
helium 4 will go on to fuse with other
smaller nuclei to form heavier elements
like beryllium carbon and oxygen but
when temperatures are much hotter method
2 becomes rather common it involves a
collision of one helium-3 nucleus that's
Helion and one helium four nucleus
forming beryllium 7 beryllium 7 is
interesting because it appears stable on
paper they're the same number of
electrons as there are protons but the
proximities of its four protons result
in something called electron capture in
which case an inner shell or
free-roaming electron especially in the
case of plasma in the Sun is absorbed
into the nucleus releasing a neutrino
and accompanying energy the resulting
nucleus is thus comprised of four
neutrons and three protons transforming
beryllium 7 into lithium 7 which is
significantly more stable now a
free-roaming proton which there are
plenty of inside the Sun may collide
with a lithium nucleus to produce
beryllium once again in a process called
lithium burning only this time with an
extra Neutron tucked into the nucleus
beryllium 8 that resultant is extremely
unstable and almost immediately decays
into two helium-4 nuclei coincidentally
and there we go we ended at the same
place as method 1 only with twice as
much helium as the former by the way I
wrote this script at 2:00 a.m. on a
Sunday so you'll have to excuse the more
particular details I've glossed over and
this is a 5 or so minutes after all so
please be gentle with me thanks for the
curiosity thanks for watching and thanks
for learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
