video I make building a computer is not
that difficult take it from someone who
learned the same way many of you are
right now videos like this can go a long
way when done correctly
no pressure the bill tutorial you're
about to see will culminate into a very
small form-factor computer that isn't
much larger than an Xbox one console it
will however be much more powerful all
the parts used in this build guide are
linked in the video description by the
way so check those out if you're
interested in building something very
similar let's start off with a
walkthrough of all the components we'll
be using
first up our processor KB Lake is brand
new granted IPC gains over skylake are
awfully small nonetheless we've got the
best I 5 money can buy and it'll get to
CPU use in this build four cores four
threads a turbo boost of 4.2 gigahertz
and an unlocked multiplier specs worthy
of modern high-end gaming without a
doubt as for the motherboard I'd like to
give a huge shout out to asrock for
their willingness to send over one of
the most beautiful I TX boards I've ever
seen this is the fatalities II 270
gaming ITX motherboard equipped with
onboard Wi-Fi and overclockable chipset
an excellent aesthetic full surround
sound and optical support six USB 3.0
ports USB type-c Thunderbolt 3 pretty
much anything you could possibly want
and expect in a high-end ITX gaming
motherboard oh and it doesn't break the
bank either for Ramsey skill sent over
to 8 gigabytes of ddr4 capable of a 3.6
gigahertz frequency will definitely
verify this with our board these
Triton's e modules are drop-dead
gorgeous come in a variety of colors
including RGB now and are very well
built by one of the most reliable memory
manufacturers on the planet I can say
that with certainty our CPU cooler is a
cryo reg c7 my favorite ITX cooler it's
no larger than a stock intel or AMD
cooler but keeps temp nice and cool even
when overclocked all the while
maintaining a very quiet profile
installation is also quick and painless
as you'll see shortly our graphics card
choice is an AMD Rx for a 4 gigabyte
graphics card it's a reference model
these reference coolers are preferable
and tight spaces they keep the heat away
from other components in the cramped
space model for us things that will be
overclocking both our CPU and GPU if the
RX 40 isn't your cup of tea I recommend
either gtx 1060 or 1070 but wouldn't go
for anything less than about a $200
graphics card below that point r7
600k would become pointless you could
opt for a pricey GT X 1080 as well it's
entirely up to you and how much you're
willing to spend
just make sure dimensions are
satisfactory for the case you'll be
using installation part from that will
be identical for storage I've opted for
a 500 gigabyte Samsung 850 Evo this is
discretionary as well I personally
recommend at least half a terabyte
though you may even want more you can
also choose any reliable SSD like
they're all the same size and feature
the same interfaces so Shiva Samsung a
data PM wine SanDisk are all brands I've
use myself and have had no problems with
lastly our case and power supply the
fractal node 202 is a beautiful ITX case
with conservative appeal and an ideal
layout
I recommend purchasing one with the
included Integra 450 watt SFX power
supply just makes things easier you can
often find the combo at a decent
discount full sized ATX PSU will not fit
in the node 202 but there are other
small form factor cases similar in size
that are equipped with this support so
there are your components again you can
find them linked in the video's
description if you're interested in
building something similar the for
moving on though I recommend connecting
all of these parts to verify that they
work prior to building inside the case
you can follow along and exclude the
case installation if you'd like to run
through the checklist always a pain to
have to remove and reinstall components
in the case assuming something is VOA
now let's move on to the tutorial start
by placing your motherboard on its box
unhinged the retention arm securing the
CPU socket and lift up the door double
check that all pins are aligned and not
bent in any way see this video here if
you're interested in how to fix bent CPU
pins
don't ask now remove your CPU from its
box being careful not to touch the
contacts below or the heat spreader
above skin oils can interfere with the
heat transfer align the golden air on
the CPU with a small arrow on the socket
you can also use the small intensions up
top as guides gently rest the seats you
in the socket without applying force
ensuring that it sits flat and
unobstructed now lower the retention arm
and lock the socket door back in place
the plastic cover should snap off on its
own remove it and store it in your
motherboards box in case an RMA is in
order
next comes CPU cooler installation pull
out your cry rixie 7 and set the
backplate along with the floor included
nuts to the side for now on the bottom
side of the cooler
should be a plastic warning label
covering the base remove this before
installing don't leave this on there
that would be quite catastrophic cry rig
includes thermal paste with the c7 by
the way open it and spread a small
amount atop the center of the CPU lid no
larger than the size of a pea now a
funnel the four legs of the c7 through
the four holes on the motherboard
cornering the CPU socket put the
motherboard over and take note of these
screw locations poking through the board
from the cooler itself mark the holes on
the back plate labeled one one 5x and
run these four points over the coolers
threads use the four nuts to secure the
backplate to the cooler refer to the
Craig manual for additional
clarification it can be a bit tricky to
explain us via video once secure to
connect the four pin fan cable on the c7
to the header on the motherboard
labelled CPU fan the last major
component required by the motherboard
its system Ram pull down on the latches
of each Ram slot align the indentions on
the dims with the notches in the slots
themselves and force each module into
place starting with the ends don't have
latches that make it much easier you
should hear clicks on each side by the
way you can double check that both are
installed correctly by hopping into your
BIOS after the building process if
you're unsure now it's time to open the
note 202 and install this core of our
build four screws underneath hold the
roof in place remove these and set the
cover aside for now install your
motherboards IO shield into the long
rectangular door at the back of the case
start from one corner and work your way
around can be a bit painful and
time-consuming you get used to it after
a while now slide your motherboard
gently into the case using the four
standoffs and the rear i/o shield as
guides you can use the quadric c7 as a
handle sorts when doing so once lined up
secure the board to the case using the
four included motherboard screws at this
point let's start wiring a few of the
smaller cables included with the front
IO of the note 202 a cable management
guide you can check out by the way is
right here I recommend starting with the
smaller cables first and working your
way up to the largest ones you'll first
want your HD audio and USB 3.0 cables as
well as the power LED and power switch
wires that are pre routed from the front
panel locate the header marked HD audio
and connect the appropriate cable use
the missing pin as a guide do the same
for the USB 3.0 header use the
indentions to ensure proper orientation
in this case the front panel connections
only the power led and power switch in
this case should be
installed here labels are printed on the
motherboard but don't hesitate to refer
to the motherboard manual if you're
unsure this step is perhaps the most
difficult because the connections
themselves are so small let's connect
the larger motherboard cables next the 8
pin CPU cable should be run along the
side of the motherboard and secured with
zip ties where necessary to ensure a
clean aesthetic this header is keyed but
you can also line up the latches with
the indention
on the header itself lastly tackle the
24 pin same process as before cable
managed as you go SSD installation is
next remove the drive bracket align the
four holes at the bottom of the drive
with those on the bracket and secure the
drive using four included drive screws
they should be the same size as the ones
they used to mount the motherboard
be sure the SATA hubs are facing the
inside of the case connect to SATA cable
that looks something like this to the
smaller hub on the drive the asrock
fatality motherboard comes with a few
black SATA cables that you can use also
connect SATA power from a cable
sprouting from the power supply you want
to run both of these cables through the
cutout in the middle of the case now
connect the opposite end of the smaller
static cable to a hub on the motherboard
either of the two closest to the 24 pin
will do you should hear a click when
it's fastened properly the last cable
you need to run is the PCIe power cable
follow this through the same Center cut
out to the left side of the case this
one will provide our graphics card with
the additional power it needs the last
major step is graphics card installation
although for a PC like this you could
probably get by without a graphics card
of gaming is in the top priority start
by prepping the PCI riser card this
larger extension should be inserted
first pull back on the motherboards
lever before insertion it should snap
into place screw this into the case
frame as well and then connect a smaller
extension remove the two slot covers in
the back of the frackle node 202 and
prep your graphics card for installation
slide the card into the smaller
extension protruding through the frame
and use the included support beam to
hold the card upright it's not necessary
but it makes things look a bit nicer use
the screws from the two slot covers to
fasten the rx 480 to the chassis lastly
connect a six pin cable you previously
route it over here to the six pin header
on the graphics card if your card has an
eight pin instead use the additional two
wires from the PSU PCIe cable as well
repeat if you have another six or eight
pin on board now make sure no wires are
interfering with the graphics card and
CP
fans zip ties or your best friend and
scenarios like this even though you
won't see much of this cases insides
when the top is on it doesn't hurt to
keep things nice and tidy in here for
the finishing touch
reinsert the top case cover gently flip
the entire thing over and secure it with
the four screws you previously removed
congratulations you just built a
computer
I pushed the CPU to 4.5 gigahertz
without a hitch I probably could have
overclocked it a bit more maybe 4.6 4.7
gigahertz but I was worried about
temperatures it's very constrictive case
and the cooler is quite small I 264
temps never past 75 see after about 30
minutes I'm comfortable with that
the fans are very quiet even under load
power consumption is very low thanks to
state-of-the-art
architecture and the PC as a whole is as
portable as a next-gen console perhaps
its coolest trait there is a lizard on
the floor he's looking right at me
I guess I'll just leave them in here
he's not hurting anybody
if any mais gonna kill the other things
or it might be in here anyway if you
appreciate its really we really still
staring right at me if you appreciate
this bill guy be shooting this video a
thumbs up thank you very much be sure to
share this video with as many friends as
you possibly can especially those who
are interested in building small
form-factor pcs let's say you have a
friend named Andy who's I don't have
been playing consoles his whole life you
can tell Andy he can build a PC similar
in size so the console is currently
gaming on credit for about three times
the price is filled with about 900 bucks
all the parts included but I'll pack a
huge punch a much bigger punch than what
his consoles currently punching says did
that make sense I don't know I'm still
kind of mesmerized by the lizard here
that's it I'm gonna end the video and
I'm gonna do something about the lizard
I'll take a picture when I'm on twitter
follow me on twitter if you want to see
a picture of a random
probably the worst marketing tool I've
ever used advertised Twitter
this is Salazar studio thanks for
building with us family get the loser
now
