I'm going to be comparing both of these
cases here I have on my left the be
quiet dark bass 700 with integrated LEDs
we'll talk about that a second and also
the lien lis alpha 330 X this also comes
in a white version as far as I'm aware
the 700 is not yet although there might
be one coming soon maybe a special
edition I'll talk to the folks over at
be quiet about that but for now I have
the two black cases now this one is not
as long as the be quiet cases but
they're very similar elsewhere dimension
wise they're about as wide as each other
and they're also almost identical when
it comes to the height aspect as well
but like I said this is a very
functional case this case has just a
nice finesse to it very nice form we'll
talk about the differences in which one
you should buy so what we'll do first is
tackle the Alpha 330 X from leanly this
case is a very form-based case in the
sense that it's supposed to look really
good and you can get that vibe just from
looking at the outside of the case
tempered glass on the left side of the
front panel and on the right side if you
know you're into seeing your cable
management of the rear so pay special
attention to that because if you do have
that exposed to any amount of space in
your room you'll be able to see
everything back there starting with raw
hardware support up to a 360 millimeter
radiator fan combo up front thanks to
the cutout in the basement also up to a
360 millimetre read fan combo up top
because everything is pushed a little
more tour the left side of the case
you're not gonna worry about RAM
interference very much at all unless you
have some really absurd gaudy Ram so I
was convinced at first glance that this
case would not have adequate cable
management Headroom on the right side of
the case however there's about an inch
and a half of clearance between the
motherboard tray and the start of the
tempered glass on the right side which
means that you have more than the space
for extra long cables if you want to run
cable extensions all of that should be
plenty fine I would say with even
non-modular power supplies another cool
feature these two thumb screws when
released will open a door just slides
down there's a hinge at the bottom
actually two of them and this gives way
to a cable management shroud similar in
design to the
the XTS 340s 340 Lee Campbell Shroud
except this one is not too gaudy it's
not too ostentatious and it doesn't take
up a lot of room in the front of the
case you should still run your graphics
cards all that plenty fine in fact
there's a few mounting places up front
as well for SSDs and pumps and
reservoirs so you can stuff your cables
back here any excess cable so you can
have just kind of run down the side
again over an inch and a half of
clearance here so you're not going to be
too concerned or you shouldn't be too
concerned about where your cables will
be routed just keep them kind of clean
because you've never you can't see back
here just hinge the door back in place
and then screw the two thumb screws back
into the chassis and there you go all of
your cables for the most part are gone
another cool feature you can actually
mount hard drives behind the motherboard
tray it's a testament to how wide the
right side of the case is for that cable
management this is a simple thumb screw
here just unscrew it slide it up a
little bit there you go there's your
harddrive tray released secure the
harddrive from the bottom and then slide
the drive bay back into position apart
from that there are two additional
harddrive tray mounts down below in the
basement there's also an adequate space
for your power supply and not the
biggest power supply so fit back here
unless you want to remove that hard
drive bay again it shouldn't matter too
much though because you do have these
hard drive trays behind the motherboard
shroud so I don't think it's going to be
a concern you know whether or not you
can use this because you do have to here
there's no space up the front but here
up to four three and a half inch hard
drives and then if you want to mount
SSDs you can do so here here here you
can also do so where the hard drive
trace could also be mounted and then you
can mount to back here you really just
tape them anywhere I bet the official
SSD mounts was about seven or eight of
those in this case so plenty of support
there you can also mount some up front
if you're into showing off what your
SSDs look like but the the drive support
in this case is actually quite good now
on to the front of the case this is
where things get a bit dicey I start
questioning some of the design choices
here because for one they literally have
a pump a reservoir mount integrated into
the basement which tells me at first
glance that this is a case designed
solely for custom loo builders or maybe
they just wanted to have it extra you
know in case you want to build a custom
loop in here it's certainly
friendly though it doesn't hurt to have
it it just looks a bit weird with it in
there and nothing on it and then you
take it out you got four random holes
that really go nowhere
I guess it's a nice addition though I
can't really complain it's also riveted
so you're gonna tell for sure that
something should go there if you decide
to remove it completely there is a large
rubber grommet on the basement at the
back good for your front I Oh power
reset switches all of that there's also
a big groove right here for I'm assuming
GPU cables and that's it although I'm
not sure why it's so long maybe it's
just because some graphics cards are
short some are extremely long so you do
have your really nice and big one here I
would say that if it was rubber grommet
Adana it just looks a bit weird having a
long narrow hole cut out at the front of
the basement other design choice is a
bit questionable not sure why they're
rubber grommets way over here I mean I
guess for fans you could just run cables
through there for your fans but they
don't need to be this big hey unless you
want to run your 24 pin all the way
across this cable shroud but mainly use
does something really cool here
something that I wish NZXT would do with
their cable shrouds I've given you a
cutout up top and a cutout down below to
prevent your cables from getting cramped
you know there's not much space between
the cable shroud and the motherboard
tray so having this cutout here will
prevent those cables from being crushed
especially your 24 pin should look nice
and pretty once everything is inside
lastly I want to talk about the rear of
the case there are two vertical graphics
card slots kind of defeats the purpose
of having them though if you don't
include a riser cable Lenalee does not
so if you want to spend extra twenty to
fifty bucks you can utilize that again
though for your cards on air you're
gonna be really choking it because the
card is gonna be pressed right against
that left tempered glass panel so not
recommended unless your water cooling
first and foremost also there are eight
PCI slots oriented horizontally which is
a bit questionable because this makes it
by definition a full-size power although
nothing else about this case is telling
me that it's full size so the ACE slots
just kind of there for looks you can put
four two slot cards in here if you
wanted but that bottom one would
certainly be choking for air the top and
bottom of the case are protected by dust
filters the one up top is magnetic which
is cool again that supports are up to a
single 360 milray da tur fan combo also
front IO consists of two USB 3.0 ports
on Mike
phone jack headphone jack a power button
and a USB type-c port really cool to see
that in cases nowadays so it's nice if
you want to you know do anything really
fancy like Paul's hardware did to get
USB type-c support in his case the be
quite dark Bay 700 case by the way also
has type C support we'll talk about that
here in a second underneath the case you
also get a very large dust filter easy
to remove keeps everything nice and
clean down there for your power supply
now it's the be quiet dark bass 700 turn
at first glance I really like the way it
looks it's super clean I really like how
they've included these covers here for
where the hard drive bays would usually
be they came equipped in the dark Bass
Pro 900 which I reviewed right here but
they've basically hidden holes with
these plastic covers that you can remove
really nice to have those gives it a
nice clean aesthetics you don't see all
the way through the cables on the right
side of the case now the basement also
completely modular you don't want the
basement at all just remove the thing on
an issue and by the way if you want to
invert the case and flip everything
around to where the tempered glass panel
is on this side on the backside then you
can just kind of flip everything around
and still have a fully functioning
basement and yes the text is still right
side up
you also have three large rubber
grommets here where you'll expect to run
your 24 pin your SATA USB 3.0 all that
good jazz so really nice to have three
of those spanning the entire length of
where the motherboard should be another
thing to note though if you want to use
the rubber grommets in this case will
only support technically up to ATX
motherboards EA TX will probably extend
over the rubber grommets you might not
be able to use those in which case
you'll have to remove some of these
plastic covers and run your cables
through there won't look as pretty but
at least you have the option for larger
motherboards if you so choose
I like how be quiets also included two
silent wings three fans with the case
maybe a third one but maybe that's
pushing it I don't know if this price
point I'd say that a third one will be
really nice because you can fill up that
top slot at the front of the case you
have basically everything you would need
ventilation wise to and take someone out
take and that's gonna be good enough
right but having two is still decent at
least I didn't cheat out and go with
some crappy fans that's something that
the Alpha 330 X by the way definitely
did do is cheap out on the fans you get
one fan at the rear and it
trash throw it away right away if you
buy it these fans though keep them for
life they're really good family links
three fans from be quiet you do get one
harddrive tray
what's one harddrive tray with the
purchase of the dark base 700 least you
got once you want to put one up front
you can do so and take out one of these
plastic panels you should be good to go
there you know if it came with a velcro
strip yes it does okay I was about to
rip on this case we're not including
velcro straps because they're literally
just tied here with tie straps like
sandwich tie straps but you do get some
velcro straps not sure why they didn't
just throw them in there and guide the
cables with these in the first place but
you do have them if you want them again
kind of weird they didn't use them to
begin with but the cable management and
here isn't as clean it's not you're not
gonna be able cover anything up like you
will in the Alpha 330 X but it's very
simple to guide these cables you got
plenty space again about an inch and a
half with the clearance in the right
side of the case so you're not gonna be
too worried about where your cables are
going also because you have the basement
down below any excess cabling just stuff
down there you should be alright in
other news on the right side of this
case there is a completely ripped off
SSD mounting system behind the
motherboard tray guess where this came
from as far as I'm aware fractal design
I liked how they utilize the dead space
be quiet essentially ripping them off
and doing the same thing but hey if it's
not patented I don't blame them for
copying because it's a great to design a
great use of that wasted space a simple
thumb screw secures everything where it
should be below that you'll find a third
SSD tray and where the fourth one will
be to the left of it there is a fan huh
good for what it looks like up to six
fans we want to include some splitters
maybe up to ten or so be on the safe
side there it is powered by SATA and
believe I don't see any molex down here
that's a good thing
I hate molex those who have been here
for a while I know why so SATA power
that's a great thing and all the sex
your space up here is pretty much good
for hard drives there's two extra hard
drives mounting points below in that Bay
and it does look like it is removable so
you'll have extra space if you have a
really long power supply and just want
to stow extra cables down there now the
front of this case had me for a bit by
the way this is a fingerprint magnet
anywhere you touch you're gonna
basically leave fingerprints or some
kind of smear it's just the nature of
the case I was trying for the longest
time to figure out how to take off this
front panel I wasn't sure how I actually
message Chrisman be quiet on
to inquire about how to get it off
because I thought I had to take the
entire front panel off all the way down
to the legs because that's what it shows
in the manual but in fact just a simple
yeah there we go
just pop off this little front panel
here and there you go access to the
three 120 millimetres fan mounts the
front dust filter is very easy to remove
a simple latch up top undoes it and it
spans the entire head of the case for
all three of those fans that you could
potentially put up front here regarding
the front i/o starting from the left we
have what looks like a makeshift fan
controller it was turned into one from a
previous USB 2.0 or 3.0 slot pretty cool
how they did that also they do the same
thing with the USB type-c port a three
point one port there there's a
microphone jack a headphone jack a large
power button very satisfying click there
a hard drive LED notification icon
there's also a RGB switcher here just
click it to cycle through the different
colors at the front of the case and
there are two USB 3.0 hubs on the far
right side as for the rear of the case
very similar design to the Alpha 330 X's
I feel like they could have maybe shaved
a few extra centimeters off the back but
they wanted space for a longer power
supply you can tell that they did that
because the mounting points are way
further back then the rear i/o panel is
also the vertical graphics card mounting
system sticks out a bit more - so they
wanted to be pretty flush and that's why
it is a bit longer than the Alpha as
well now let's talk price I already
mentioned that the Alpha 330 X is priced
at about 120 to 130 US dollars good
price for a leonie case because most of
these in the past have been around 3 to
400 bucks thanks to all the tempered
glass but because that's now more or
less a standard it's hard for them to
differentiate their build quality with
other competitors that were on the
cheaper side previously and to keep this
price under about 150 bucks they also
threw in a really cheap fan and no RGB
connectivity the dark bass 700 though
comes in a bit higher comes in about a
hundred and eighty bucks it does have
integrated RGB LEDs though it also has a
sound damage foam on three of its panels
it also comes with two silent links
three fans which we could say are about
twenty bucks a piece also comes with an
integrated fan hub which is proud
another 10 bucks now whether or not you
should include those already in the cost
of the case is beside the point
nonetheless this is a better equipped
case for what you're getting price-wise
it is a bit pricier but if you want the
same kind of stuff in this case you'll
have to pay more for it at which point
these two case prices kind of level out
one other thing that I did not discuss
but that I at least want to mention is
the airflow with both of these cases be
quiet cases of excellent airflow they
always have for the most part the
airflow and the front is gonna be decent
because you have about an inch worth of
clearance for air to move and that's up
to make a 90-degree turn which makes
things quite loud and slightly
inefficient but that's okay
up top though I am a bit more concerned
because you only have these six little
ventilation slots up top so if you want
an exhaust array especially in a custom
loop it's not gonna sound too pretty up
here because the air has nowhere to go
it's just gonna hit this panel and make
a lot of noise with the alpha 330 X 2
though complete opposite story so the
exhaust arrays not gonna be too bad in
terms of air flow because all you have
is a single little dust filter up top to
prevent dust from getting into the case
due to the effects of basically gravity
so if you're exhausting most of the time
dust isn't gonna get in here anyway but
when your computers off that's why this
is here in case you're wondering about
that up front though really restrictive
it's it's gonna be a big issue I'm gonna
run some tests when I do the dedicated
build video in the alpha 330 X but we're
talking I mean just a tiny little sliver
for air to move in at the top of the
case and the front and also a tiny
sliver at the bottom this is worse than
the NZXT s340 considerably worse also
worse than the Fant XP 400 so we'll do
some front panel on front panel off
tests will also do the same with a dark
base 700 especially up top here because
I'm pretty concerned about exhaust
setups with this arrangement it's just I
don't know why they did that if you are
interested in either these cases you can

new egg actually but I appreciate any
purchase via those links because it does
give us a small kickback helps us make
