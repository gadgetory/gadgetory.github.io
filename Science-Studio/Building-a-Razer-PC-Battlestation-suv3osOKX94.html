are building a razer workstation for
Lisa she used to use a razer kraken
headset and that's about it because
we've had to pay everything on a pocket
and razors kind of expensive and make no
secret of that I'm sure they don't
either they're premium products and this
PC 11 dynamic Razer Edition is
definitely a premium feeling product if
you love the PC all--even dynamic
already you're going to love the
additions to this case I believe as well
razors done a great job kind of chroma
fiying it up making it RGB without being
too in-your-face if you will so I'll
show you some stuff shots of that when
we put the build together now speaking
of which let's go ahead and do that
here's the bill blog and then the final
workstation setup are you in dire need
of yeah an upgrade look no further than
power colors red dragon Vega 56 at only
$319 from March 8th to the 11th and 3
epic games included you're getting one
heck of a bargain purchase now via the
link below
so a few things I do want to discuss
about the build I hope first off that
you guys enjoyed it I know this is
probably not in everyone's taste but we
just wanted to experiment try anything
out and see just how cohesive all the
Razer products were from an RGB
calibration standpoint and our Razer
synapse is actually very easy to use
kind of auto detects pretty much every
product that's a razer compatible or
that is a razer product right away when
you plug it in which is really nice you
can sync up all the components including
the case which is actually really cool
so it's you know unless you're buying
like corsair products or i'm not sure if
you can do it with many other cases that
are RGB cases but maybe Coolermaster
feel there's a lie to do something to an
extent like this but i've never seen
just a totally cohesive RGB build to the
point where you can actually control
everything with just a single software
suite and in this case it's Razer
synapse and I've got to say they did an
excellent job and I think the revisions
they've done to the PC old and anemic
are pretty sweet as well that said look
I'm not gonna toot razor's horn anymore
you guys I'm sure have some sort of
predisposition a belief about Razer at
this point I think they make good
products I just think they are a bit
expensive
now the PCO lemma dynamic chassis itself
I don't think he's overpriced but I did
not look up the MSRP of the racer
Edition so let's see if I can do that
right now okay says it's selling here
for one hundred and seventy bucks and
you get a free land lease trimer RGB
power extension cable as well that's
actually really cool so the stronger
itself is uh already twenty thirty bucks
if I'm not mistaken and the Oh lemon
dynamic is already a hundred and twenty
ish dollar case again if I'm not
mistaken so one hundred and seventy
bucks you're really getting a stronger
for free and you're only paying about
$30 worth of markup for the Razer
edition and if we're talking
historically here like with the NZXT
Razer additions like the s3 40 and the
h4 40 Razer cases those were a bit more
expensive as well so this is actually
pretty sweet I mean even if you don't
like Razer products if you like the
subtle RGB qualities of a case like
this then I'm pointing there because
that's where the boxes her build is like
her entire battle station whatever you
wanna call it's over there but even if
you don't like raze I think this is a
really great addition because the RTP
qualities are subtle enough I really
like the under glow I think it's my
favorite part about this you have that
internal Razer logo etched into the
front glass it's just it was a beautiful
case to begin with and in my opinion now
it's even more beautiful again
Razer aside I think that the entire case
has just gotten that much better with
the RGB inclusion so but that said I'm
going to leave the rest to you guys in
the comment sections below let me know
what you think about the build
wait think about the build log the video
in general and if you're interested in
buying a case like this you can check it
out via the link below I think we have
the Newegg link for sure and the Amazon
link is probably coming a little later
it takes a while for them to get this
stuff in the Amazon warehouses so that's
why there's always usually a delay there
with case launches but anyway yeah you
guys liked the video thumbs up know what
to do click the red subscribe button if
you haven't already
this is science to do thanks for
watching and thanks for learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
