actually does it's often overlooked
because its name is somewhat
misunderstood or just not understood at
all so let's break it down
ambient means immediately surrounding
and occlusion means blockage I'll
combine the two ambient occlusion for
gaming is defined as the point by point
technique by which object exposure is
calculated with respect to immediate
surroundings think of it as a shading
technique in games without ambient
occlusion and Mabel's shadows are only
generated by objects blocking light from
a particular directional source like the
Suns is noticeable especially outside in
games without these shadows games would
seem very unrealistic but ambient
occlusion is a more subdued technique
that doesn't necessarily involve light
direction here's an example in this
frame the left model represents a
scenario without a Oh
the right with both appear realistic
that the left model seems overexposed
and lacks a bit of contrast whereas the
right accentuates even the finest
details through the use of additional
shading but here's the catch the extra
shading isn't the result of the
directional light source pay close
attention to both of their heads the
shadows they yield imply a light source
shining in this direction and the model
on the Left feature shadows accurately
generated as a result all over the face
but the right model takes things a step
further
it also features shadows generated by
itself what I mean by that is that the
creases and abrupt changes in the shape
of the model's face are also producing
shadows very small shadows but enough to
enhance the models textural details and
that's kind of the point of ambient
occlusion while tessellation seeks to
physically alter and improve structural
accuracy and 3-dimensional ISM enabling
ambient occlusion generate shadows
produced by the tessellation itself not
necessarily the directional light source
the technique uses ambient light hence
the name and immediate changes in space
to produce shadows that aren't
necessarily amplified by a directional
source you can actually mimic this
effect by tinkering with contrast levels
which will accentuate those slightly
darker tones but the two are not
directly related you can however
experiment with AO and games like GTA 5
which let you turn it on and off with a
single click I actually encourage you to
do that I think you will see a
difference AO or SSAO can actually have
profound impacts on visual detail
without slicing into your framerate your
results of course will vary depending on
hard
we're and the game in question but
ambient occlusion isn't something you
should just ignore in the graphical
settings panel do let me know what you
think about ambient occlusion let me
know if you like this style video and if
you let you see more of them in the
future you know the routine thumbs up
thumbs down subscribe if you haven't
already and I will catch you in the next
video
this is Salazar studio thanks for
