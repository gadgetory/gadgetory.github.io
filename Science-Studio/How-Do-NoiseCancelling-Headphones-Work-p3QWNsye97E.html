and there he goes
noise cancellation Believe It or Not has
been around for quite a while to
surprise me since the mid 1900s the
first applications were aircraft
oriented and rightfully so it's why I
bought a pair myself this is the Bose
quiet comfort 25 headset equipped with
an inline microphone remote powerful and
clear speakers and of course noise
canceling technology it works by the way
very well but how exactly does it work
how do you just cut out ambient noise
first we have to address sound waves in
general they're compressional forces
anything that makes a sound is
compressing and expanding the fluid
around it picture like a moving pressure
wave but it requires a medium and that's
why outer space is virtually silent so
instead of this
you'd actually hear this we can map
these forces using sine waves where the
peak of every wave is its compression
and the trough of every wave is its
rarefaction the amplitude represents the
strength or loudness of the sound that's
basically how tall away it is and the
wavelength represents the frequency or
pitch that's how stretched out the way
it is this for example is an extremely
low
bassy tone whereas this would probably
make your dog freak out different
animals pick up different frequency
ranges and those typically narrow as we
age separate video for now let's depict
an oversimplified high-frequency
jet-engine tone that you'd likely hear
on an airplane it's peak to peak
amplitude is this let's say and it's
wavelength is this what noise
cancellation technology seeks to do is
first detect the sounds being produced
by objects in the environment via
microphones on the outsides of headsets
like these and then to reproduce those
sounds again in ear but with a twist and
that twist is offsetting the phase by
180 degrees essentially shifting it over
by one pi lengthen radiance this new
phase is called the anti phase so in
essence the replicated sound wave
produced by the speakers in this headset
will look nearly identical to the way
produced by the turbine however since
the anti phase is being generated here
destructive interference occurs where
the ambient peak occurs the anti phase
produces a trough so you're actually
hearing two sets of tones in your ear
the first is being produced by the
speaker that's the anti phase and the
second is being produced by the object
in the background this equal but
opposite pattern exists for the entire
span of the wavelength and yields the
virtually inaudible tone ie noise
cancellation think of it like addition
and subtraction where compression occurs
for a particular tone only positive
numbers exist where rarefaction occurs
negative numbers if two over lapping
waves exhibit equal but opposite
amplitudes and the resulting amplitude
must be zero at a peak in trough let's
say two minus two that result is zero
somewhere to the right one minus one
equals 0 and here well it's already zero
that is wave interference in a nutshell
now the technology isn't perfect but
neither are the tones being produced by
objects surrounding us predictable
patterns are best mitigated airplane
noises constants in most parts so it's
easily canceled but if the person next
to you blares music out loud headphones
these won't do well at suppressing that
noise it's unpredictable and all over
the place by the time it figures out the
pattern it's already changed so the
applications here are wide and varied
but it's not foolproof so don't buy
these to tone out your barking dog or
your roommates loud television set
rather buy these for a nice long flight
across the Pacific or a room in which an
AC unit is extremely loud only four
places in which tones are rather
predictable and just annoying a brief
rundown of these headphones here by the
way they sound great even better with
noise cancellation turned on takes a
single triple a battery on one side and
you're good to go
otherwise you can still listen to them
plugged into a source just without a and
C one thing though you'll notice a bit
of added pressure in ear once you turn a
and C on and it's something that I can't
really explain in words it's why headset
reviews on YouTube were kind of stupid
but I encourage you to go to your local
tech store try a pair on this on display
you'll know exactly what I'm talking
about but are these still worth it oh
yeah even for the hefty penny I paid on
paying for the name I understand that
but I'm also paying for the quality so
no buyer's remorse here I purchased this
set out of pocket in an airport actually
but I still do recommend them to
frequent fliers and audio files alike I
don't think it would disappointed at all
with the quality this sound quality the
II get from these but I do think you
might be disappointed with the price
just depends on how much you want to
spend how much you're going to spend for
a name-brand product like Bose you are
paying partly for the name and partly
for just the quality of the product in
general as usual we can find this
product link in the video description
check it out let me know what you think
if you like this video be sure to give
it a thumbs up thumbs down for the
opposite or if you hate everything about
life you should click Subscribe but if
you haven't already and I will catch you
in the next video this is science studio
