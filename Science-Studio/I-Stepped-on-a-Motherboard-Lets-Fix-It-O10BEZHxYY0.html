had my MSI create motherboard sitting on
the floor no excuse for that and I also
had the CPU socket exposed with no cover
on I don't recommend doing that either
again no excuse I just I got it from my
chair my my ankle swept right across the
socket and bent several pins go ahead
and show you the state of affairs now so
that is the MSI board and go ahead and
yeah split right there
so you can see it just hurts to look at
that hole right corner up there is just
destroyed so I'm going to try to take an
old car maybe like it's an ID card or
something and see if I can bend those
pins back obviously this board is not
going to work as is I'm not going to try
to put an X on a nine chip in here and
see if it'll work it's just not they're
not going to make proper contact those
pins aren't with the with the chip so
I'm going to try to bend them back as
best I can make them look like the rest
of these pins here and then I'll put my
ten korzy on in here the Broadwell II
five twenty six thirty v4 I want to see
that's the chip put that CPU in here and
we're going to see if it works
after we attempt to rebuild the spins
into the correct orientation so yeah
let's give it a go let's see I'm trying
to see how far I can zoom in here
without the camera going out of focus
but uh yeah
so that section and see if we get a
better top-down view of it all right so
what it looks like is those pins are
bent upward yep they're definitely bent
upward that's my ankle went across this
way so it's swept it that way and the
pins were kind of oriented like this at
first and then they got pushed up so
we're going to have to bend those back
down it shouldn't actually be that hard
so I'm going to take a card and I'm just
going to go that like that like that
however many times I need to to get
those pins back in line like it's very
easy to see what pins are not where they
should be
but it's not very easy to bend them back
exactly where they need to be so I've
actually got this old Motorola SIM card
a little ejector thing I'm actually
going to use this because this pin is
about the same size as each of the pins
in the socket so let's see if this works
any better from certain angles it's very
easy to see which ones are not where
they should be
you kind of have to look at this as just
like one big piece now because if you
try to look at individual pins you'll
just throw yourself off just look at it
as one unit and then just kind of get
that mental picture in your mind and
you'll be able to pick out the pins that
shouldn't be where they are and if you
have a decent light you know I have a
lamp here and you get the the angle of
that light approaching the socket just
right it'll definitely help with your
ability to discern those bad pins and
one thing you definitely definitely
don't want to do is you know pull or
pluck a pin to the point where it either
snaps and breaks off or just get bent so
far into the socket that you can't
recover it because then at that point
you might as well just trash your
motherboard it's just trying to solder a
single pin into something like this is
gonna be a nightmare there's a slightly
on reflection coming from here don't
know which pin that is though shouldn't
be there sorry I know the camera work is
just kind of shoddy right now it's very
difficult to film something this
meticulous but I do want to show you the
process and I think it's just good
knowledge in general if I run into
anything unexpected I can say that I
captured it on camera or at least walk
you through it as I suffer here okay so
it looks kind of decent from this angle
from where you guys are looking at it
right now so I'm going to swing the
camera over to this side so you can look
at it from another angle over here and
you'll see what I'm seeing there's just
a you know there's still a big chunk of
the socket that isn't where it should be
there you go so yeah you can see there's
still quite a few pins that are out of
place so let's see if I can give you
guys that camera angle now and do bear
in mind the orientation of the
hands that will definitely help as well
in this case here just because most of
them were brushed backwards all I have
to do is just press them down again and
they typically kind of just set back
into their original positions so it's
not as bad as it seems
okay almost almost there we're almost
there okay so at this point looks are
deceiving it looks to be pretty good
there's a few few issues kind of up
there but it looks much better than it
did however I'd be willing to bet my
lunch money the CPU still wouldn't work
remember these contact points on the
chip itself are super small they're not
much wider than the pin in the heads of
these pins so we need to make sure these
pins are almost exactly where they were
before I yeah kind of brushed them with
my ankle okay so now I have a really
thin it's kind of an old SPE car this
was my old society petroleum engineering
card whatever that member number doesn't
mean anything to me but I'm going to try
to use that now to pull some of the pins
that are pushed too far down back up
just a tad I don't know if this is thin
enough it's probably not but I don't
have anything thinner that is sturdy
enough that's stiff enough to to pull
these pins back
oops get in there almost there if this
works I'm going to call myself a
professional CPU socket specialist you
know you're important when you have the
words professional and specialist in
your title another way of verifying
where your pins are located just lower
your head to where it's level with the
socket level with the entire motherboard
and you should be able to see very
distinct straight lines going all the
way through you can see here it's
divided there's one half there and then
there's the other half here so these
pins on this side are bent one way and
the pins on the back or bent another way
now but you can look down each section
and verify whether or not the pins are
aligned perfectly you can still see how
some of those up top there or not which
tells me that not good enough yet
okay I am calling it I've been working
on this for about 45 minutes now and
then no it looks pretty good to me what
do you guys think before I test the CPU
do you think it'll work the way it is we
see I'll give you another another view
the light on this side you can see how
it does look a tad bit different there
are very very tiny changes in positions
overall but I still think given the
slight change in about 10 or 20 of these
pins that they'll still make proper
contact with the leads on the on the CPU
that's what I'm thinking but we'll find
out right now
okay I have the 5820k in here because
the 6800 K which is a broad bowl II
processor might not be compatible with
the BIOS that's on this MSI create
excellent Eli motherboard this
motherboard was designed and
manufactured before Broadway II was
released so there's a chance that that
BIOS might not support Broadwell
natively so I have a 5820k in here to be
safe I put the 10 cores II on in my
personal rig chillin yeah right there so
we're going to do now I don't have on
hand just like a regular cheap cooler to
stick on there what I do have that oh
don't worry don't cringe too much that's
right I'm just going to shove this
cooler onto the 5820k and I mean it's
it's only temporary we're going to just
make sure it posts and that's it that's
all I want to confirm here so it's
nothing permanent it's going to be very
temporary but I did this will at least
keep the CPU from severely overheating
within the first few seconds of booting
so I'm going to pop this cooler off and
I'm just going to stick it on there I'm
not going to latch it or anything the
thermal paste is relatively sticky and
I'll just lay the computer down on its
side and should be good to go
okay so we're just going to push this
firmly on the CPU like so okay TV is
good to go I've plugged in the HDMI
cable and the power cable and that's the
USB hub I can't really tell it's pretty
dark in this room but there's a USB
little plug right there and that
connects to a wireless keyboard mouse so
we can control what we're seeing on TV
although all we're looking to do here is
verify that it posts so let's turn on
and see what we see what yet I don't
think I'd there we go now let's try it
okay
and
and we're just waiting on a post now I
hope
maybe oh that's a good sign okay I have
the keyboard here so we're going to run
the setup press f1 there we go and CPU
is an i7 5820k writes stock okay we only
have 12 gigs of ram which means i didn't
properly insert one of those dims well
apart from that and that's no problem
that's a two-second fix the CPU is
detected that's a great sign that means
that the pins were reset close enough to
their original positions with a CPU can
function normally so yeah I'm going to
call that a wrap if you happen to do
something as stupid as I did and step on
your socket or you know just end up with
a motherboard that has a few bent pins
in the process before you return it I
suggest because you're gonna have the
box open anyway by that point you know
just returning it with an open box is
inevitable but at that point I would say
if you think you're up for the task and
you want to kind of do what I did bit
earlier in the video you can attempt to
reset those pins yourself and then see
if the CPU is detected by the
motherboard and you get a post you won't
get a post if the CPU is not seated
properly or if the few of those pins are
misaligned so this is your way of
verifying that and if you can verify
that your CPU is detected that means
you've done a great job at fixing your
CPU socket so I'm gonna call it a wrap
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
you feel it's cool give it a thumbs down

you haven't already
I promise folks this is my last screw up
for a while hopefully I'm gonna knock on
wood this is Salazar's studio thanks for
learning with us
