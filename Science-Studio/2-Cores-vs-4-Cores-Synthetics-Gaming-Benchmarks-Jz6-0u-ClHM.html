twice as many cores actually yield twice
the performance we're going to run some
CPU synthetics as well as some gaming
benchmarks to test this hypothesis so
first let me run through the test bench
that we'll be using to run both of these
scenarios first up we have an Intel i5
4690k overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz yes
that was as high as I could get it
without seeing severe CPU temperature
hikes that was it was a little scary
once we got to 4.7 I didn't regard it as
stable so we went back down to 4.6 and
that's pretty much where it's gonna stay
from here on out I have snapchat we have
an azrog z97 extreme for LGA 1150
motherboard as well as 8 gigabytes and -
4 gigabyte variants of kingston hyperx
ddr3 clocked at 1866 megahertz now you
probably expected me to have a pentium g
32:58 lying around to mimic the 2 core
cpu that we'll be using on our other
tests but what I have done instead is
use the exact same 4690k and just turned
off two of those cores to mimic to an
extent the G 32:58
so the overclock remain the same and of
course everything else in the test bench
has remained the same but the difference
there is going to be only two cores
running at any given time versus 4 so
what I did first was I ran the
benchmarks with all 4 cores running at
4.6 gigahertz apiece and so these are
the results for the synthetic CPU tests
that we found first up is Cinebench and
our quad-core CPU achieved a score of
583 now 4.6 gigahertz this might seem a
little low but that's because we had a
screen reporter running during the
entire time that we were running both of
our sets of CPU synthetic tests so these
scores are a little suppressed they'll
actually be a bit higher I think with
4.6 eager Hertz and no screen recorder
running we achieved a score 670 so 100
of those higher than what we achieved in
this one is actually what you would you
in a C if you like this overclock to
this extent now for Geekbench 3 which
was the other CPU synthetic test that we
ran we achieved a single core score of
41 36 and a multi-core score of 13 to 36
those are the CPU synthetic tests for
our quad core now let's hop on over to
our dual core and see how those scores
compared to those of the quad core if
you're wondering how I was able to turn
off
to Poor's my CPU it's very simple go
ahead and restart your computer push f2
or whatever button corresponds to
pushing your system into its BIOS it
depends on your motherboard you can see
your manual if you're curious about that
and then for me particularly I'd hop on
over to advanced settings click on the
CPU tab and then change how many cores
are running from 4 to 2 or all the two
in my case
it's really that simple and then restart
your computer and you're good as gold
so once booted into our operating system
once again but this time with only two
cores activated we ran both CPU
synthetic tests once again with the
screen recorder running now obviously
only having a dual core in this case and
using the screen recorder at the same
time will affect performance a bit more
than it would with a quad-core CPU just
because you can't multitask as much with
only two physical cores so the scores
are probably a little bit biased towards
the quad-core in this case however I
will show you in the geek bench test
that things weren't as skewed towards
the quad core CPU as you might expect so
first up is Cinebench let's go ahead and
get that out of the way it took so long
for cinnamon to finish with only two of
those little yellow squares rendering
images at the same time I'm serious it
probably took about three minutes for
all these run and we're at 4.6 gigahertz
here this is what most people can get
their Pentium G 32:58 stew and our
cinnamon score overall was not very
promising we only achieve a score of 256
CP which is a little under half of what
we achieved with our quad core CPU at
583 but let's move on to geek bench
because geek bench is going to show us
something special here geek bench not
only measures as a multi-core
performance of our CP but also the
single core performance and if our
theory is true about single core
performance and it being the exact same
CPU it's not really a theory it's kind
of very proven our single core score
should be nearly identical and it was it
was identical to our quad core CPU it
was close enough it was 40 40 and dual
cores case and it was 41 36 and the quad
core case so you could argue that there
are a few little minor processes in
there that might require more than one
core that the single core benchmark
takes advantage of but for the most part
we can say that the screen recording
aspect of running our CPU synthetics
hasn't affected our dual core as much as
we might have anticipated it to being
that it only has two cores and it's
going to struggle to run multiple tasks
any time now when things start to
changes our multi-core scores here so
what remember a quad core scored 13 236
but our dual core scored 70 100 so
actually a little over half of what our
multi-core score was for our quad core
synthetic test so you can pretty much
say here that our performance was almost
literally cut in half in terms of these
two specific CPU synthetic tests next up
with the gaming benchmarks I know these
are the things that you guys actually
care about so I'm not going to talk
through each one of these individually
like I usually do I'm going to show them
all to you and let you guys decide which
of these two CPU variants either the G
32:58 mimic or the 4690k mimic is more
ideal for what you expect to get frame
per second wise out of the games that
you choose play here the graphs
so obviously the i5 one but it's the
margins by which the i5 one in three of
the four cases GTA 5 being the exclusion
here that have me second-guessing the
viability of an i-5 for gaming you see
if you could purchase a G 32:58 in
overclock into four point six gigahertz
and get somewhere around what we achieve
for our dual core experiences here in
games is it really worth paying any
extra money I mean we're talking 100 to
200 dollars of extra dough for an
unlocked I 5 processor when you're still
getting around 60fps and most of these
games with just a dual-core so I get
sets the question that will be left
unanswered in this video is it really
worth the extra 100 to 200 dollars
that's a lot of dough to our books is a
lot of dough for a lot of people to get
an i5 when you're really only getting
about 20 to 30 percent additional frame
rates in most of these games GTA 5 of
course being exception once again just
because GTA 5 is very CPU intensive the
more coins you throw GTA 5 for the most
part the more FPS you're going to get
marginally but for these other games
here for a dying light for black ops 3
and for dirt rally pretty much any
racing game you can think of it really
kind of representative all live games is
it worth the extra money let me know in
the comments below if you're a video
editor if you render a lot of things or
I don't know edit photos music stuff
like that obviously the i-5 is going to
be for you and I would prefer you to get
an i-5 because a dual core really isn't
going to keep up as much with those
processes but if you're just a gamer g32
58 anyone anyone is it worth it is it
not be sure to subscribe to us we
haven't already like the video if you
like the benchmarks and what you saw in
this video dislike if you didn't let me
know what you'd like to see improved in
future videos this is science studio
