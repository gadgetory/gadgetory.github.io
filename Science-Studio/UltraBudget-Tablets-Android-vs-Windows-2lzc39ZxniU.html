looking for something cheap portable and
classroom or work break worthy well
first up Apple's probably out of the
picture unless you can find whether iPad
Mini 2 is used on the black market or I
suppose an iPad Mini 1 you're likely not
willing to shell out the extra dough if
you are then I suppose you can pause
this video where it's at and move on to
something else maybe this video right
here but if you plan on sticking around
chances are you're considering one of
two platforms Windows or Android both
have their pros and cons and we'll
discuss these shortly and both are
featured in tablets you can pick up on
the cheap the two we'll be checking out
today the Acer one 10 which I have a
separate review on you can check out
right here and the Pacific tech 9.6 inch
tablet actually think that's what it's
called the 9.6 I didn't see a name
anywhere else in the description
you probably haven't heard of Pacific
tech professional and neither had I but
they offer this tablet right here for a
hundred and forty bucks US dollars okay
not bad let's check out the Acer 110
well to my dismay they aren't widely
available like they used to be but I did
find a batch of refurbished ones on
Newegg for 120 dollars so we've got a
price out of the way where do we go from
here let's start with build quality the
Acer 110 features a brushed aluminum
back with trim sides a bulky stance even
when separated from its included
keyboard and fairly wide bezels at least
and compared to the Pacific tech tablet
this one looks and feels completely
different and sporting a plastic back
cover which you can pick up in either a
gold plus white combo or black plus
black a much thinner profile and
narrower bezels on all four sides but
it's a tablet so that shouldn't be much
of a surprise the Acer posts a wide
array of external support including a
headphone jack micro HDMI port micro SD
card reader micro USB port and a
charging port on top you'll find the
volume rocker and power button and power
slash charging led the right side is
completely bare and the bottom reveals
the keyboard locking inserts as well as
the data transfer interface the back of
the tablet boasts two narrow trebly
speakers an Acer logo in the center of
the metallic panel and a two megapixel
rear camera the front of the device
gives way to the 10 inch IPS display a
resolution of 1280 by 800 pixels an
interesting form factor it's not sixteen
by nine but it's pretty close a front
facing camera whose specs aren't even
worth mentioning but ok its VGA and a
Windows icon towards the bottom which
acts as a home button for pulling up the
Start menu
I am here with a good old JJ hey
everybody say hi I'm probably not told
anything expression hey
on the Pacific tech tablet you'll find a
headphone jack power button and volume
rocker followed by only a single
microUSB port up top which also acts as
the charging port the back of device
boasts a rather subpar 5 megapixel
camera that also films at 1080p but not
efficiently here have a look fun facing
recording is that's ok so how to YouTube
mamma the back also sports a small door
housing 3 slots 2 for SIM cards and one
for expandable micro USB storage yes
this tablet supports calling and 3G data
so long as the SIM you insert is backed
by GSM towers Verizon and Sprint will
not work in this case I forgot to
mention this tablet does have an LED
flash as well the Acer tablet does not
but beware use it only in a must basis
the front of the Pacific tech tablet
only reveals a single front-facing
2-megapixel camera unlike the Acer this
one's buttons are all on screen the
screen of course is also here and it's
ironically in the same resolution
boasting the same lukewarm IPS
technology as well definitely not iPhone
quality you catch my drift
however thanks to this one slightly
smaller screen size pixel density is
slightly higher yielding ever so
slightly crisper shapes on screen you
probably won't notice the difference
between the two I did notice that the a
search screen produces much cleaner and
whiter colors whereas the Pacific tech
tablet projects a warm yellow hue so
you've seen what these two look like now
let's find out how each of them performs
the Pacific tech tablet houses an armed
mt6582 gigahertz and a single gigabyte
of RAM it's a quad-core processor with a
relatively low power demand but
underperforms all around just look at
that single core score 359 by the way
that's the Acer on the left still
running the Geekbench test and that's
where this leads us next Windows 10
takes a huge toll on the Acer 110 the
intel atom z3580 so the quad-core chip
backed by 2 gigabytes of laptop grade
ddr3 but the added stress from something
as heavy as
does ten 32-bit proves too much for the
little Adam even when executing this
simplest of tasks even pushing the lock
button requires a few seconds before you
get a response does it even there goes
so yeah a little too shabby the pacific
tablet on the other hand i'm going to
call it the pacific tablet from now on
response almost instantaneously it's
running android 5.1 so not too ancient
and responds adequately to all commands
and downloaded apps the android
experience however is limiting in the
sense that you can't simply open dot exe
files and edit documents on legit copies
of microsoft office but good ol pacific
isn't missing much i mean it's not like
the acer can run office buttery smooth
it takes time to load open and even
respond from keystrokes at times it does
have access to the microsoft store and
we'll play games like minecraft ok but
that's about it and pacific can do the
same thing with a minecraft APK file
much better optimized and smoother
feeling overall if battery lifes are
concerned then the Acer 110 is not the
one you should consider I've only
received about three to four hours of
screen on time with the Windows hybrid
and no there's no expandable battery in
the removable keyboard Pacific's 5,000
milliamp battery is much smaller than
the Easter's but the reduced software
overhead allows the tablet to reach a
staggering 6 to 7 hours of screen on
time at least for me it varies from day
to day but it's proven to be a much
better tablet in this regard it also
charges much faster now what about
speaker quality you're gonna have to
bear with me on this one
so the rest of this review honestly just
comes down to preference
oh they're decent in their own respects
for their prices and even though I would
recommend either to any power user
they'd be great for those who enjoy the
simpler things in life YouTube videos
and candy crush I actually ended up
giving the specific tech tablet to my
mom who's been very much enjoying it in
fact she wants it back right now so once
a she's not super tech savvy and
honestly couldn't care less about the
price or trade-offs words with friends
is still her thing and the Pacific tech
9.6 handles it just fine as for the Acer
thing
get a little more complicated I used it
for a while in school until I purchased
my Lenovo 100's which is a full-on
laptop but that has a much slimmer
profile but which also has the exact
same specifications as the Acer 110
although I'm sure the laptop / tablet
hybrid is appealing to some the physical
keyboard makes it more apt for a
document preparing than the Pacific and
it also boasts a single USB 2.0 port
which might come in handy at an
unexpected time do keep in mind though
that you'll have to leave the keyboard
on and plugged in in order to use it as
for me personally I would opt for the
Pacific tech tablet and let me explain
why it's not because I don't need
another low powered laptop that would be
unfair and biased but because I feel
that at this price point the only thing
you should be considering is an Android
or Apple tablet and yes that means that
I should have spent more than I did on
my 100s I'll admit it 150 bucks is just
too cheap to justify a quote-unquote
decent Windows laptop nowadays sure you
get the full Windows 10 experience but
at the cost of performance and that's a
huge cost save up a bit more and invest
in a tolerable laptop with either an i3
or an old I five or an a-10 from the red
team for around 300 bucks take the
Pacific tech tablet download minecraft
and candy crush saga and call it a day
if you like the change-up here in the
studio be sure to give this video a
thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
feel the complete opposite or if you
hate everything about life be sure to
click the subscribe button if you
haven't already in stay tuned for more
change ups here in the studio I'm sick
of doing the same old benchmark routine
with cards like this I want to bring you
guys new material different stuff and
just kind of play by ear where we want
the channel to be in the first stable
future so with that I hope you enjoyed
what you saw be sure to stay tuned for
the next one
this is science studio thanks for
