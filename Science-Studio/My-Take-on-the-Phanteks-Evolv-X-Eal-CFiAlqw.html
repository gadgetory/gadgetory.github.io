action here before we get started with
the review of the Vall vexed I wanted to
show you guys what it looks like after
one full day of building in a case and
this is why case reviews are probably
some of the most in-depth and
time-consuming reviews on the channel
because we do have to build in the case
right to properly test it with respect
to airflow cable management feature sets
all that good jazz and so yeah just a
little to little hints and all the work
that goes into putting one of these
videos together so if you like the video
at the end of this one give it a thumbs
up I do appreciate that now let's get
started the fan texts evolve X was one
of my favorite cases at Computex 2018
it's premium construction was prominent
the integrated RGB was subtle but unique
and its convenience when building
appeared to be top-notch and I can
confirm that this case is indeed one of
my favorite to date and here's why so
the evolved ax utilizes all space at its
disposal in the most effective way
imaginable while by definition this is
only a mid tower with seven PCIe slots
it can support up to slimmy ATX
motherboards to 360 millimeter a iOS and
even up to a 420 toward the front if you
want to get fancy with it the back has
an adjustable 120 or 140 millimeter
mount for the same and above this you'll
find a second rear i/o cutout for that's
right an additional I TX system so you
can technically fit up to two systems in
this mid tower thanks to an optional I
TX bracket it's actually really simple
to install it gave it a test run before
filming and does indeed have enough
clearance for an ITX board and slim CPU
cooler up top it will eliminate a 140 ml
fan slot up top though dual system users
aren't likely to care I mean come on to
systems and something this small is
pretty awesome speaking of which the top
panel is fitted with a removable bracket
that aids in the installation of fans
and radiators I always enjoy seeing
these subtle modifications to otherwise
plain jassi's to access this bracket the
top panel needs to be removed and only
two captive thumb screws hold it in
place additional upgrades by the way
include a video card a riser bracket and
cable this would allow you to take
advantage of these three vertical slots
towards the far left though you may want
to shy away from this altogether unless
you plan on liquid cooling your graphics
card because it does position the
are so close to the left glass you'd be
effectively choking your card of air so
instead what I've done is use a kit from
coolermaster that allows me to mount the
graphics card significantly closer to
the motherboard thus keeping temps in
check the two doors on the evolve X by
the way are great I've got the one on
the left side swung wide open they're
easy to remove since they just slide
under these hinges here and remain shut
on their own though included thumb
screws it can be used to ensure that the
doors remain closed staring shipping or
just transporting in general the insides
of the panels are by the way it lined
with a soft material that grips the
chassis and ensures a smooth seal it's a
nice touch the top panel is rather bare
save the power button and these events
running down the left and right edges
they're wider this time around and
should aid in the exhaust aspect of this
cases airflow pattern 3 140 millimeter
fans are included with the evolved x2 up
front and a one at the rear they're
actually pretty great considering their
stock and run fairly quiet when
calibrated conservatively I have them
running at just a stock fan curve right
now and the loudest thing in here
honestly is the pump in the AIO and to
make wiring simple there's an included
fan hub with the Evolve X allowing you
to connect up to 8 fans to it some of
which are pwm the others are voltage
controlled now as discussed in our
Computex coverage these doors right here
are adjustable sliding front to back
depending on the Headroom you need for
cables running to your motherboard they
can be tightened via thumb screws from
behind I'm not the biggest fan of this
design in practice I'd honestly prefer
something as simple as rubber grommets I
think they were fine to begin with this
is kind of like reinventing the wheel to
be honest so to me that just doesn't
look as clean this way I expect it will
be subjective though so you might like
this more now additional cable
management on the right side however is
a breeze thanks to several integrated
velcro straps tie points and two large
doors that serve as both drive bays and
cable shields if not for these two doors
the right tempered glass panel would be
a nuisance you'd see all that just the
mess of cables back there but with these
doors things look extremely clean back
here my only complaint is that they're
difficult to unlock from these plastic
arms the basement has a ton of space to
work with optional hard drive trays can
be locked into position down here and
extended power supplies will still fit
without a hitch the case is actually
fairly large considering its form factor
and due in part to its secondary ITX
support and rad space elsewhere so in a
nutshell this case really has all the
necessary cutouts for cable routing
special doors to keep things nice and
pretty and a beautiful aesthetic I had
no qualms at all building in the case
cable management was a dream one of the
easiest cases in which I've ever had
cable managed and the whole build
process was just sped up because again
everything is where it should be and
some things are significantly improved
by the way if for some reason you have
six SSDs laying around you can mount all
six to these two doors for a total of
nine dedicated locations in the entire
case so yeah if you're just like an SSD
hoarder this is the case for you fan tax
also supplies a graphics card anti-sag
bracket which you can install behind
cards to straighten them out it's kind
of difficult to explain in person but in
principle pushing this bracket as far
down as possible against the rear prongs
on a card should straighten it out
though I found this was difficult to
replicate in practice the bracket just
isn't strong enough and you have to just
apply a ton of force to get the card to
you know straighten up just a tiny
little bit ultimately the card was still
sagging after like trying my hardest to
get that thing to straighten up so I
ended up ditching the bracket altogether
I ended up ditching horizontal
orientation and just installed the
vertical bracket so things look much
more straight and consistent now on to
airflow fantex was claiming up to three
times the airflow over the original
evolved back at Computex though I don't
see anything that's specific on their
website I don't have an original evolve
on hand to verify this claim maybe in
the future we'll do that but what I will
say is that this case is actually
effective in supplying air the front
panel has been pushed further to the
front funny enough this time around
providing upwards of 30 millimetres of
headroom for air to straighten and pass
through the front dust filter this in
combination with cuts made elsewhere on
the front panel allow the edges of fan
blades to pull air straight into the
chassis top and rear ventilation by the
way is satisfactory allowing for either
passive or active exhausting depending
on where you place additional fans I use
the three sixty millimeter H 150 i from
Corsair so I move the two stock fans
from the front to the top and an exhaust
array so you know you don't need those
up there but you do have support on the
built into the case to allow for those
fans to get rid of the heat it might be
trapped otherwise inside CPU
temperatures with the front panel on
under a stock fan curve approach 71 C
when the fluid reached equilibrium with
the panel removed things settled to just
below 70 degrees the Delta here is
pretty small suggesting a near optimal
front panel design in fact by including
a second variable the dust filter up
front and removing that our our TX 2080
graphics card settled down by another
four degree suggesting that the filter
may be more at fault here than the steel
panel itself actually the front panel
may be aluminum I'm not sure I know that
both are used in the case but either way
the thing feels premium heavy and sturdy
other subtle improvements really have me
raving over this case in a good way
fan --tx added a little indention on the
bottom up front to make it much easier
to grip when moving the case before all
you could really do was hold it on
either side which was extremely awkward
I know Tony had the original evolve and
that thing was a pain to deal with
especially when we were carrying it to
and from land fest and why not because
you had to grab it around the edges and
the case was already heavy to begin with
his build was even heavier at a custom
loop inside of it and it just I really
was afraid I was gonna drop the thing
having to hold it around the sides like
that so having that little indention up
front actually makes it so much easier
to transport this case if that's a
concern this is definitely an
improvement front I oh by the way it now
includes USB type-c which is nice and
the large iconic door shuts to hide
everything from view this is traditional
of all fashion here the LEDs included
behind the front panel are not wired
directly to the rest of the frame making
removal very easy so you're not gonna
snag cables they glow very nicely on the
inside diffusing beautifully that's what
I like to see and the strip integrated
along the top of the basement is another
nice touch so LED integration is here in
the evolve X but these are also
addressable LED so you can customize the
look and feel these to a much greater
extent more on that in this video right
here so I'm actually looking forward to
building something like a custom loop in
this case it has a couple of special
features with that in mind like
dedicated fill and drain ports and the
space in here is almost perfect for a
full loop so we'll see but for now I
don't know what you think about the
evolved X I know you've seen other
reviews more than likely by this point
maybe this build in particular has
thing that you like about it you don't
copy something like that I'll include
those parts if you want to build
something like that they'll be Amazon
affiliated so it does help me out just a
little bit if you want to buy anything
through those links but again your
opinions matter I want to know what you
guys think in the comments below give
this video a thumbs up if thought it was
cool dislike it for the complete
opposite feeling or if you hate
everything about life it's okay should I
click that red subscribe button having
already stay tuned for more content like
