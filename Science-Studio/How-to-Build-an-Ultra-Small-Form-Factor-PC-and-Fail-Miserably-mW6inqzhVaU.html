video we're going to put together an
extremely compact PC and I'll show you
step-by-step how to do it now I've
reserved a dedicated video for this
because it takes a special finesse to
build a system as compact as this and I
can already tell you right now we're
going to use an AMD APU now but we're
also going to be dealing with a very
very small sort of unconventional power
supply in this space so the AC adapter
section would be external so we'll have
a power brick but we'll also have a
separate board inside the case it's
gonna run next to our ITX motherboard
that we'll have to deal with and I don't
know how we're gonna fit all these
cables in here but I'm gonna show you
some tips to make this process a bit
easier and of course I'll run through
the typical how to build a process so
you know exactly what to do from start
to finish so let's get started so these
are all the components you're gonna want
to buy and you don't have to buy the
exact parts that I have here but you're
gonna want to follow a similar format if
you want something that's small starting
first with the case I think you should
in this case build you know pick your
parts around a case like this because
you're gonna need to pick a board that
will fit in this
you'll also need to pick a CPU cooler
that will fit in this case because the
clearance height wise is not a very
tolerable you're also going to need to
pick a drive that will fit in here
obviously this tiny little case here
which we'll talk about more in a second
it's not going to support a hard disk
drive of any sort so only two and a half
inch SSDs or m2s
any kind of like PCIe based nvme drive
or even a SATA and got two like this
will do so these are the parts again
just want to give you a brief summary of
what we're going to be working with
you're also going to need a Phillips
head screwdriver it's really about it
you don't need anything else you can
kind of get by with just that tool there
and also you're gonna have a bag of
screws and maybe even zip ties and stuff
that come with your case I just like to
collect all of them so you'll see me
periodically reaching out of here for
some screws but you should have all that
included in the case when you buy it so
let's get started let's start first with
our motherboard in today's build guide
we're gonna use the MSI be 350 I which
stands for I TX and then Pro AC the AC
standing for a built-in Wi-Fi support
now I think for smaller cases like this
having onboard Wi-Fi is kind of
necessity because this might not be
hooked up to a LAN cable if it's sitting
in your living room if you're using it
as like an HT PC or even if it's mounted
to the back of a monitor or something
like that which we can do with our an
Tek case so it's important we have the
ITX form factor and in my opinion Wi-Fi
is also a plus so we're gonna pull out
the board placing it on top of the box
this will act as our makeshift workbench
we're not worried about this cutting
into the box the solder points on the
bottom of the board can be a bit sharp
and we don't want to work directly on
our table surface because we could
scratch things other than that it really
doesn't matter where you work as long as
the system's not running and you're not
know know using a metal table or
something like that
so this is our ITX board this is where
we're gonna install the CPU this is
where we're gonna install the RAM these
retention clips we can kind of we can go
ahead and remove these because our cool
we're going to use which is the stock
horizon Wraith stealth cooler will not
require these clips so first thing we're
gonna do take our Phillips head
screwdriver and remove these four
Phillips screws I recommend saving these
put these in either CPU box or back in
your motherboard box because you might
at some point need these now most older
Andy coolers will use these clips but a
lot of the newer coolers won't require
it you will likely need to use the back
plate those will have a small little
standoff sticking through and this is
where you're going to screw in the new
cooler so keep this backplate that's
this piece right here underneath the
motherboard now our CPU cooler by
default remember will not fit in our
antec case so what I had to do is remove
the plastic outer ring that has the AMD
logo on it I have more info in the video
description of how to remove this
depending on the CPU cooler you use you
might have to modify it just a little
bit in our case we had to but I wanted
to get that out of the way upfront
before we install the CPU so you know
exactly how we got this to fit in our
build now we're going to install our CPU
so go ahead and slide that out of its
box you see this is just a chunk of
silicon and metal most of the metal
you're seeing here is the IHS this is
designed to spread heat across the
larger surface area than the die
underneath most of these chips are
soldered so you won't find too many
direct die solutions now the key thing
you're going to want to pay attention to
is this Golden Arrow if you align this
Golden Arrow with the arrow on the
socket which you can see right here it's
a
tension triangle you're gonna want those
two to match up so this is the
orientation the CPU can see if I can get
their reflections just right you can see
the Rison word is facing this direction
right toward our rear i/o it might
differ from board to board but in this
case this is the orientation we're gonna
want to drop the CPU in its socket so
what you can do first is lift this metal
lever pull out and then up it'll stand
straight up take the CPU align that
golden arrow with the triangle on the
socket drop the CPU into place very
gently you might have to slide it around
just a little bit to get those pins on
the CPU to slide into the socket there
we go once it's all the way down the
silicon practically makes contact with
the socket you can risa cure the CPU by
sliding this lever down you might feel a
bit of tension there and then snap it
underneath and you're good to go you
just installed a CPU next up we're gonna
want to install the CPU cooler now
depending on the cooler you're using
again you might have pre applied thermal
paste I've already removed it in this
case so there's none applied but if you
want to use stock compound it's there's
no issue there it's not gonna be the
best quality you might have slightly
higher temps but in general it's
acceptable to use that and all you have
to do is just sandwich this on top of
the CPU align the screws on both the
bottom and top over those little pins
sticking through the board and then you
can screw them in with your phillips
screwdriver in our case we don't have
any pre apply thermal compound anymore
so I'm going to use thermal Grizzly's
cryo knot solution this is high quality
thermal compound and we're going to
apply it like so I suggest with Rison
cpus a slightly longer line from top to
bottom just as I've done a little more
isn't going to hurt you just don't want
this running over it just gets messy
it's not conductive so I wouldn't worry
too much about that you don't want to
put too little that did this paste
itself doesn't cover the entire IHS
because heat will spread across this
entire metal plate so that's why I put a
little more than you might be
comfortable with and then we're going to
sandwich the CPU cool or a top align
those screws with the pins running
through the board that secures it to the
backplate then we're going to take our
Phillips screwdriver and start twisting
now this point your board might be
flexing just a little bit on account of
all that torque we've got in this cooler
it will bend the board slightly and
that's okay these boards are designed to
be somewhat flexible but you don't want
it of course like you know doing some
weird u-shape that would be an issue I
probably wouldn't torque the cooler that
hard but as is we're fine now we have
this cable here this is a 4 pin pwm
controlled fan cable we're gonna want to
connect this to one of our CPU fan
headers we do have two up top here and I
really doesn't matter which one you pick
some boards won't even let you boot they
won't even you know although post but
they won't leave boot into your
operating system less you have a fan
cable connected to the prime CPU fan
header in this case I'm pretty sure with
MSI it doesn't matter we're gonna plug
ours into the CPU fan 1 header so we'll
take the cable like so it's keyed to one
side so you can't really install this
backwards we have this extra slack here
and we could do any number of things
with this it really doesn't matter as
long as it's not blocking something else
that we need to access on the board
we'll be fine
next up is Ram installation now I must
confess this system is actually going to
my wife's mother and she is she's not an
avid gamer or anything like that so 8
gigs is gonna be enough for her and in
this case you'd really want to go with
dual channel memory using an APU it's
gonna benefit you quite a bit you didn't
want fast Ram as well but she's not
going to be stressing the system at all
so that's why we're going with a single
dim but in most cases for a build like
this you're gonna want to go with 2
sticks even if it's 2 4 gig sticks
sticks that's ok because you're going to
have dual channel support and that will
benefit you to a pretty decent extent
with respect to these ap use in our case
again doesn't matter so we're just going
to install a single dim and if you look
right here on the board and see it says
a dim a1 and dim b1 a and B are two
different channels that's why this board
supports the dual channel memory but
we're only going to install one and the
optimal place here is a1 obviously a
comes before B install a first there is
a notch on the module mind the notch
there is a small little indention here
on the socket it's
right there once we have this notch
aligned with the indention in the slot
we can slide the module into place this
will require some force here take two
thumbs one on each side push down on one
side first till you hear a click just
like that now holding that thumb still
in place push down with the other thumb
until you hear another click there ya go
so now our module is installed what you
can do is turn it sideways see if the
module is kind of sitting crooked if you
can see a lot of the copper exposed and
it's probably not seated correctly in
our case it looks good if it doesn't
post this would be one of the first
things I would try maybe remove this
module move it to the other dim slot or
just make sure that it's pushed in all
the way modules are of a very frequent
cause of failed posts you know pcs just
won't boot up at all probably because
one of these modules isn't installed
correctly now this right here is our
entire system practically we just need
power and we need a storage drive of
sorts so what we're going to do next is
install our m2 SSD now this is actually
a fast SSD and the only reason why I'm
including in this budget build is
because I got this for a really great
deal on new weight these are going for
around a hundred bucks each so I bought
two of these and they're 480 gig drives
which is I think plenty for a budget
build also extremely fast
these are Gendry by for four-lane nvme
SSD so we're gonna get insanely fast
reads and writes our systems gonna boot
up very fast and we'll be able to load
games and anything else on this Drive in
a snap so if you want an ultra-fast
computer for just day-to-day tasks I
highly recommend an m2 SSD particularly
an nvme one because you're gonna use a
different interface and it will be
significantly faster than SATA more on
that in I don't know which side the
videos gonna be on one of these sides so
we're gonna pull this drive out and you
can see it is extremely small there
isn't much to it it does not come with a
heatsink of any sort so if we had a
heatsink available we could put that on
top of this well actually it does come
with a very small one but it's not gonna
do much so I don't think in this case
it's gonna matter
we'll go ahead and slide it on just for
good measure but it really won't make
much of a difference
I can see most of the chips are on this
side so we're going to install it like
so make sure we don't cover the cutout
for the screw now where does this go
where do we install this there's no slot
anywhere here whatever where do we push
it right it's actually on the back of
this board it will depend on the board
you can refer to your manual if you are
a bit confused but you can see we do
have an MDOT to pour right here and we
have the screw pre-installed this is
what we're going to use to lock it in
place so your big Phillips head
screwdriver might not work in this
application if you have a smaller one I
recommend you start with that otherwise
you'll probably strip this tiny little
Phillips screw here you can see there is
a key in this port on one side there's a
very small area for a few connections
and the other side is much bigger and
you can see the end to drive follows the
same suit right so a very small key off
to one side so we're gonna align it like
so in this case we're going to whoops
backwards slide it in just like this
toward the top of the connector it'll
snap all the way in you shouldn't see
any exposed copper we're gonna push this
down about as far as we can and then
we're going to secure the m-dot to drive
with the removed Phillips screw another
thing to be careful of there are
actually two screws that go into this
hole and the first one you're gonna want
to keep installed before you install the
drive so I actually messed that up
myself when I was installing this the
first time I realized that when I
unscrewed this I actually took out both
ends you just want to remove the thin
Phillips screw that sits on top of this
plate the reason why you want to keep
this in is because you don't want this
making contact with anything else on the
back of the board just for good measure
we don't really have anything insulating
this side other than a sticker so just
mind that you can see now when we
install it the in that to drive is not
touching anything under the board see
there it looks like it is but it's it's
not it's much better now than it was
before we can take this tiny little
Phillips screw I'm going to seat it like
so there we go our drive is secure and
again the only thing we have left to do
is install this into our case and then
set up our power supply our wiring which
will be difficult to do
and we'll be ready to boot now to prep
our case what I suggest you do is remove
both the left and right panels move the
cables out of the way as much as
possible without snagging them and
tearing them in mind the standoffs you
can see these little gold standoffs here
there's gonna be four in total for an
ITX board and you're gonna want to line
the standoffs off with the four holes
and mother which I'll show you in a
second but the other thing you don't
want to pay attention to is the rear i/o
cutout that's this large rectangular
cutout here on the back of the case
you're going to want to remove your
motherboards IO shield from the box
it'll look something like this and
you'll notice there are pins that stick
out on one side these are designed to
press against the rear i/o ports on the
motherboard so you want these pins you
can see in how they stick out here
you're gonna want these facing inward so
the smooth side is facing outward all
right so we're gonna want to install it
like so the other thing to keep in mind
is orientation so you could really put
this in this way or this way either way
will work but your motherboard has its
layout designed a specific way so when
it's facing out and the rear i/o is
facing out like this you want to pay
attention to where these ports are these
are the microphone headphone jacks
wherever this is your AC Wi-Fi is right
next to that you're gonna make sure that
you align the rear i/o the orientation
that you insert this so that this fits
into this right so now we're gonna slide
this through and you're gonna want to
press on it it's gonna be a bit
frustrating depending on the case you
push one side in the other side pops out
that's kind of how these work this is
frustrating but they really did it so
you do it enough times and you get used
to it so the more you practice this will
get easier so there we go REO REO is
installed and then now we can thread our
motherboard into place using the rear
i/o as a reference as well as the
standoffs that I talked about earlier we
can see there's standoff right
everything's mirrored on the screen
right right there that's one of our
standoffs so we install the motherboard
keep
yeah be careful of these cables the
especially in this case this is why I'm
making a dedicated video for this this
PC build here I think what I'm going to
try to do is slide it you know front
side in first kind of push it to the
back if that's possible is it possible a
lot of cables preventing us from going
straight in like that okay let's try
going in from right to left make sure
none of these cables get stuck behind
the motherboard when you finally install
it by the way okay so I finally got it I
kind of pushed the board in like so kind
of pushing the rear i/o into place first
and now what we're going to do secure
the mother more to the chassis with four
included screws I will get four of those
and show you what they look like they
kind of look like this and they have
little disks wrapped around them almost
looks like pre-installed washers of
sorts you don't want to use four of
these and screw those into the standoffs
on the four corners of the motherboard
that's what those cold things I was
pointing to earlier
alright so board is secured to the
chassis that was actually kind of easy
anti gave us these convenient little you
know hemispherical cutouts here that
make it much easier to slice Phillips
screwdriver into the tight spaces it
needs to fit so now we have all these
cables and these cables are going to be
the bulk of the remaining portion of
this video getting these into their
correct places so a quick rule on cable
management what I like to do is start
with the smallest cables first because
it's very difficult to work around these
thicker cables or you know these like
angel hair sloughs of cables especially
the 24-pin of the AP ApS so start with
smaller cables first you can kind of
squish those down with the larger cables
as you progress through the wiring
section of your build so we have a power
switch we have a hard drive LED we have
power LED positive and negative and I
think that's it so no dedicated reset
switch not a big deal for this chassis
here but we're going to want to pay
attention to these wires want to make
sure we plug these into the correct
headers on the board now in our case the
front i/o header
motherboard is right here you'll see it
usually denoted as jf p1 and this right
here is the correct pin out for front il
connections so make sure that you abide
by this key when you're installing the
cables that I just showed you otherwise
you could fry an LED or your system
might not power on at all because you
wired it incorrectly
another quick pro tip if the positive
and negative terminals are not listed on
the plastic little shroud for these
connectors what you can do is reference
the small little arrow that points
toward the terminating point of this
clip if that arrow is on one side the
states on the left side then the left
side is the positive terminal that means
the opposite side the right side is the
negative terminal and with the front i/o
connections the positive port is almost
always the left pin so the one that's
closest to the rear i/o of your
motherboard just a rule of thumb not
always the case but it could help if
you're in a tough spot so that there was
our hard drive led my kind of tucked
that cable around the perimeter of the
motherboard next we will do the power
switch in this case polarity doesn't
matter you're just completing a circuit
with this switch so you don't really
need to pay attention to which side is
the positive side lastly our power LED
positive and negative wires that'll do
okay next the smallest wire is HD audio
and it will typically be denoted as such
you can see there HD audio and that port
is going to be typically very close to
rear i/o as far down as possible with
ITX they can get a little weird but
you'll see usually on the board a label
that says something along the lines of
HD audio it is keyed a certain way by
the way so there's only one way to
install this don't worry about
installing it upside down just mind the
key ok HD audio is installed you can see
those wires have kind of tucked against
the chassis sort of underneath the
motherboard these are all insulated
wires to be not gonna worry about
anything shorts they're getting or
anything like that but I have just tuck
those in and run those along the
perimeter of the motherboard you just
don't want these small cables kind of
just you know free hanging anywhere
because they could get caught by the fan
this is really the only
part of the system but the cleaner the
better and it makes things easier in the
future if you intend to work on this
case may be upgraded or something along
those lines
our next smallest cable is USB 2.0 and
this is key to certain way as well as
you can see the bottom left or the top
right up in your orientation that is the
heed slot and you'll typically see this
denoted on the board as such USB 2.0 you
can see in our board it just says USB
and it's actually written into the
header itself so you just have to pay
attention to that this is not USB 3 USB
3 uses this port which is much different
so you're not really going to confuse
the two unless you just do this
blindfolded next up is USB 3 that's this
connector right here these are pretty
difficult to work with the cables are
rather thick we do have two USB 3 ports
in this case so that's why there are two
wires connect enjoin at the head and USB
3 port is basically what I just showed
you it's this longer kind of port here
and there are many more pins than there
are with USB 2.0 this is probably also
going to be labeled on the motherboard
now the last cables to worry about our
power for the motherboard CPU and our
drives we have the 24 pin which powers
the motherboard and to an extent
peripherals we have the a pin eps this
could be a four pin depending on the
board and the platform that you choose
this power is the CPU directly then we
have our SATA connectors you have
actually SATA here which is this is a
SATA power cable and then you have molex
which is a small little four pin power
connector this is more old-school but
you still might see some hard drives and
other peripherals powered via this
interface in our case we have an either
external SSDs hard drives or anything
else powered by molex so we don't need
to worry about these we can leave them
as is kind of tuck them somewhere where
they're not in the way of the other two
cables we can tackle the AP DPS next the
port for this is typically located near
the upper left section of the
motherboard which you're looking at it
like so upper left is here and you can
see there's the a pin that right there
is for the CPU so all CPU power for the
most part comes through this port and
we're going to mind the clip if you see
a little lip on the port that lip is the
same side that you're going to see
these little little levers so make sure
that you plug it in like that again
we're gonna cable manage as we go kind
of tuck these cables around the
perimeter of the board and last we have
a 24 pin this is going to power again
our motherboard and to an extent
peripherals same thing you have a clip
on one side you'll find a lip on the
connection point as well on just one
side and that's the side you're gonna
want to align this clip with you know
this is properly secured when there is
no gap between the connection on the
board and the physical connector into
which the wires run okay things look
good and I'm just gonna kind of figure
out where to tuck these remaining cables
and yeah I think we'll just have to call
it a day so next thing we want to do
let's put our left side panel on you can
see this is mesh and I'll show you how
close I mean there's literally no
clearance at all between the top of the
CPU cooler and the mesh luckily and tech
indented this just enough to wear a
wraith stealth cooler with the removed
plastic cover fits perfectly can start
by securing the front of this panel
first and then you can push down on the
backside and you'll hear a few snaps you
can see we actually had a dedicated tray
here for SSDs for SATA 2 and a half inch
SSD so if you had a couple of those you
could secure those to this bracket four
Phillips screws hold this bracket in
place and it just sits under the
motherboard very discreetly clip that in
first and then the back snaps in there's
nothing really back here pressing
against it so that was fairly easy and
then we also have four Phillips screws
on the back next to the rear i/o plate
that we'll need to secure in order to
keep these panels in place and there we
go that is the entire system and this is
smaller than most consoles on the market
and it's not gonna be and I'll have to
run our test the 2200 g is not a very
powerful ap I mean it's more powerful
than something we had maybe in 2013 with
the Kaveri chips but it's not going to
replace a discrete card most discreet
cards will I'll perform this apu by a
longshot
said though there's a lot of power still
packed into such a small footprint an
tech actually did a really great job
with this case all right now at this
point we have the case sitting nice and
snug on the included stand and we do
have the AC power adapter to worry about
now so if you want to power this up
we're going to want to plug this part
this end obviously into the wall and
then the other end into the brick and
then from the brick we have this very
small connection that will make with the
back of the case so this is gonna be
similar to like a laptop and that's just
a one I guess downside of going with a
smaller compact case like this we can't
fit an entire power supply in here and
that's why we have the external AC
adapter included now let's see if this
thing power is on okay that didn't work
that's weird the power brick works I can
see the light on the brick so it's
probably something wire wise that was
either removed or that was neglected so
yeah I've tried straight-up jumping the
motherboard that didn't work I think
what I'm going to have to do now I mean
all these connections these are all
solid connections in here I check 24
1880s CPU fan cable that's just in there
I think what I'm gonna do is bypass this
small little power supply bit and just
run an external power supply and see if
I can get this power out and if it does
and that means that the both Pico
whatever format power supplies in here
just isn't working I know the bricks
working because the brick is on it's
lighting up so that means that something
in here is not properly delivering power
to the motherboard that is a shame okay
power supply on this button is not going
to work so I remove the front connectors
so let's just jump it there we go
system I'm assuming it's posting I mean
we actually get lights on the
motherboard the fans turning so
that means we likely have a dead power
supply which means we were one of the
people hit with the dead psu plague upon
arrival well guess I better call an tech
I'm gonna unscrew this board
that's a little Kico I still know if
it's a big opai's boy but it's just a
small little board in here that I'm
going to remove and see if I can see any
defects I didn't say this earlier in the
video because I didn't really think it
mattered I thought this would still work
but one of the screws on this small
little power supply board was dislodged
it was just completely removed actually
and it was kind of flopping all over the
place when it arrived so maybe maybe
something happened to it there ain't
transport not sure let's see if there
are any defects I want to be careful
with this because I don't know if
current was actually running through any
section of this but there might be some
diode or inductor or something that's
not making proper contact yeah so we
have a system that can't boot with its
own native power supply because it is
dead and hey at least you learn how to
build the system I was going to also
show you how to install Windows and kind
of include that all on the same tutorial
but I do already have a video talking
about that you check it out one of these
sides here so I will direct you to that
if you are wanting to know how to
install software an operating system or
other software but maybe I give them a
semi just a replacement board that
they've tested in-house beforehand and
then I can send this with Lisa back home
to Germany so her mom can enjoy a very
fast PC maybe not the best for gaming
obviously but fast in terms of reads and
writes we have a really fast drive in
here and I mean come on it's an APU and
2019 C APU came out what last year it's
really good for what it is really good
for the money
and so is this board with built-in Wi-Fi
and the works you guys like this video a
thumbs up you know what to do I'm sorry
I it's just kind of one big failure
there at the end but I you know to build
a PC now so there's that
this went horribly wrong click that
subscribe button if you haven't already
hopefully we'll have a power supply to
be honest in the future
stay tuned for more content hopefully
not like this this is science video
