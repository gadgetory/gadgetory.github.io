the videos in this playlist if you get
easily offended by anything these are
not the videos for you and you have been
warned I asked all of you this time
around to link some of your own local
resale ads regarding PC so people who
either build their own pcs or got the PC
second-hand somebody else or purchase
one from the store basically in a
nutshell they're trying to resell the PC
and they're using Craigslist or some
other site to do that most of the asking
prices were actually reasonable that's
not what this video will focus on
primarily I might show one or two good
ads just so that you know there are
several of them out there but this video
will focus primarily on those that are
asking outrageous sums of cash for their
rigs take this build for example Dougie
has this one from Saginaw let's see I
770 700 K gaming pc 2 terabyte hard
drive 16 GB RAM GTX 1080 TI 11 gigabyte
we are already 1430 asking price you
know this one isn't too bad just off the
top if he's got those specs in there
it's a pretty solid asking price no
trade no parting out and a monitor
included new computer build and he's got
the specs here - looks pretty old you
know I don't know which is more
cringeworthy here the fact that he's got
like a semi ITX /n ATX motherboard and
things as an arrow as an ITX board so
might as well be so we've got these
cables just kind of like sprouting up
from nowhere in the case and then he's
also got them wrapped in like red white
and blue like what I mean it lead to use
the case cutouts though at least he did
that nope never mind I found the most
cringeworthy thing about this one he's
got an i7 7700 k in there right and he's
paired it first off with an h1 10
motherboard which he cannot overclock on
top of that he put a stock Intel cooler
on top of it though cringe I'm not
trying to be a PC elitist anybody could
be one of those it's usually didn't it
take anybody's build over the smallest
detail I just have problems with most of
these prices you'll see how bad some of
them gets
all right so Daniel Rojas sent us on
this one here let's see gaming computer
power only ok leases for without that
$2,000 asking prices better be a good PC
here I 545 90s ok and then I always get
a GTX 780 in here and he wants to grin I
can tell you right now I think that's a
look at the rest of the specs here that
is not rageous asking price
alright Kellan and the Kansas City
Craigslist ad says this one's a pretty
horrible deal here $1000 for a gaming
desktop complete setup here includes a
32 inch samsung tv not even a monitor
gaming mouse keyboard desk turtlebeach
headphones also cups as well
he didn't list the specs though Senate
GT 730 and an FX 4300 quad-core
processor should take that in for a
second GT 730 okay FX 4300 and the guy
wants $1000 I'll tell you what the
keyboard right here better be worth 500
bucks the reishi p-- in Los Angeles says
this one's a bit ridiculous ultra AMD
horizon 7 liquid cooled gaming desktop
with 4k monitor he wants $2,800 so
unless and this is rising 7 here not
even looking at the specs he's got to
have to 1080 T is for me to even just be
entertained by this asking price for
sale it he didn't have a picture of the
PC oh come on rule number one if you're
trying to sell anything online post
pictures of the object you're selling
not a list of what you're selling please
see the screenshot of parts for the full
picture of what is included in this PC
wouldn't really call that a full picture
buddy but basically it's a Rison 7 1800
x with liquid cooling and radon 588
gigabytes i don't know where he's
getting this price from maybe he thinks
Windows 10 pros like $600 that still
wouldn't even come close to twenty
hundred asking maybe he thinks because
it was assemble at Fry's Electronics is
this worth twenty eight hundred bucks
oh and look at there it is just too much
PC for me that right there the red flag
too much PC come on Conor price says
that this asking price on eBay is a bit
ridiculous so Apple iMac 27-inch a
thirteen twelve and two quad-core i7 and
it's an i7 2600
nine
129 pounds for it I got it I know why
it's so expensive came from an Apple
product crackling ice in Fort Myers an
AMD gaming computer $1,800 it's got a
corsair carbide spec alpha k saccades
and it's okay
asus m5 a 97 I've had that motherboard
it's pretty cheap AMD FX 8350 okay
unlocked Black Edition oh yeah msi RX
488 gigabyte card and 1/8 gigabyte stick
of ddr3 he wants $1,800 for this thing I
know why though it's got that Razer logo
should I call him and ask him why he
wants so much for this PC he's got his
number listed right there
he'll have reached the voicemail box
oh yeah well we sure so we'll get him
next time okay one from Springfield
Illinois gaming PC for sale $500 he's
got an FX 6300 16 gigs of ddr3 a
terabyte hard drive 120 gig SSD and a
680 watt power supply all it's missing
is a video card you know what he did
right he went sold that cord on eBay
does he not realize that the FX 6300 has
no IGP so unless the guy who's going to
buy this PC brings his own video card he
will have no way of confirming that the
PC is in fact working ok this one is
from Lexie you got a fork a VR ready
gaming PC asking price $3,900 they
didn't even post a picture of the PC we
got spec wise 32 gigs of dual channel
ddr3 bite Samsung SSD ok not too bad i
770 700 K ACS prime Z 270 ROG Strix
tended to TI 650 watt power supply and
an NZXT s340 elite I'm confused where's
the other $2,000 Oh even better
VR bundle additional 3 grand what dr
bundle cost 3 grand I believe this one
is Lincoln Nebraska custom gaming PC
$1,200 asking price he says that the
condition is excellent and he says that
this is a full tower I mean it's an okay
looking bill but he's got these random
cables sprouting everywhere look he's
got one of them wedged between a PCIe
slot
this dude's literally listing his entire
fan configuration you get an FX 8350 in
there
gtx760 okay big man's going to post from
seattle full set up gaming pc $1400
selling a gaming pc which is in very
good condition got AMD FX 4300 quad core
eight gigs of ram and what kind of
graphics card you got gtx 970
the dude wants $1400 for this thing
chorus toss in atlanta sent us of this
one here custom gaming computer
liquid-cooled $2,000 negotiable but firm
on price so which is it as an i7 4790k
with thin water cooling very vivid
description there GTX 970 one terabyte
hard drive 8 gigs of system ram 250 gig
SSD looks like a Corsair 760 T he wants
to grand for it it doesn't look like
cable management was his strong suit
psychonaut has this one from Rochester
New York 4k streaming gaming pc i7 16
gigabytes 250 gigabyte SSD EVGA gtx 1050
TI what a title 1050 TI that right there
is the Achilles heel especially in an i7
in there he wants eleven hundred and
fifty dollars for it this is this goes
with Windows 10 Pro trial Edition so
that you may choose an operating system
of your choice if you like Windows 10
you can activate this copy and keep
moving forward he's not including an
operating system folks he's telling you
that price is on you that's not like
dodgy he was with reviewing the CPU
cooler here so he's got this shot which
is like kind of revealing but not really
and then these immediately pans over to
these front fans that is a stock air
cooler on an i7 processor I don't care
if it's a lock skew or not that's still
painful ish especially for that asking
price okay Steven and Tampa has a
Thermaltake view 27 custom gaming PC
asking price twenty four hundred and
ninety nine dollars that is definitely
retail mark for you make PCG Thermaltake
view 27 gaming system fitzy 270 board I
770 700 K 16 gigabytes ddr4 250 gig hard
drives none mess st we get is it an HDD
250 gig WD SSD what is that screen gtx
1088 gigabyte RGB what is screen
condition gorgeous advanced cable
you see what they're doing though they
did this in the first video as well
they're bundling these just off-brand 22
inch 19 inch whatever 1080p monitors
they're not being specific about what
brand what model because I presume
they're just trash and they're just
trying to bundle with them say hey we're
recording monitors so we can ask $2,500
now it's definitely justified I mean the
build looks fine a cable management spot
on the case looks decent but it doesn't
come anywhere close to a $2,500 asking
price okay I've got another one from
Lexie for kV already gaming workstation
computer asking price $3,200 but it's
negotiable let's see he's got an i7
5820k and he has two gtx 980 s in sli it
doesn't look like anything else in here
would well that's a pretty expensive
power supply but that was kind of
overkill and 16 gigs of DDR 4 course x99
motherboard case doesn't look too
expensive nothing fancy there and I mean
the cable management's pretty good at
least they use the rubber grommet
cutouts but I don't understand from
where the $3,200 asking price is coming
so now included with price okay one
Razer BlackWidow mechanical gaming
keyboard okay
100 bucks max one razor or a Burris
rubber Asst whatever Gaming Mouse never
actually said that word before robber
Asst that's what I'm going with and then
one three terabyte hard drive yeah there
you go
now that's why it's priced at $3,200
that was a joke and we've got one more
from gum tree comm gaming computer very
good condition 750 dollars still
negotiables got 500 views I wonder how
many views will have after this video
let's see FX 8 core processor I'm assume
8300 because it wasn't specific
r7 360 or six gigs of being Ram what
would you like some ketchup and mustard
with those fries Christopher Saunders
sent one let's see built gaming computer
$1200 got an i5 4690k a gtx 970 and
nothing else too exciting there $1200
asking price let's see-oh cost him over
1700 dollars from iBUYPOWER
last year with iBUYPOWER even selling
something with a GTX 970 in it last year
or invent us a few on offer up let's see
a hundred and twenty dollar asking price
on a GT 440
videocard check it out folks hardly used
works and looks great asking 120 OB oh
yeah you better put that OBO after that
price okay
$1,800 asking price it looks mediocre at
best case choice again it's pretty
abysmal and the power supply Lucchese
that's just like a fire waiting to
happen right there not partying I get
that like okay you build a PC you work
pretty hard on it and then all of a
sudden somebody says hey I just want
that part of it and then nobody else
wants the rest of your parts and you're
stuck with you know a bunch of stuff
that you can't sell I get that I have a
complete custom-built gaming PC specs go
as followed 6600 K GTX 980 that's about
it least he's got Windows 10 installed
he's including an LG 25 um 85 which is
the smallest ultra wide LG makes and the
second monitor is a Vizio Smart TV 45
inch still though 1,800 bucks I'm not
feeling it okay one from Cody Kessler in
Columbus ultra compact gaming a
rendering PC asking price $2,500 get an
i7 6700 K GT x 1080 for the win I'm not
seeing the $2,500 price tag where does
that add up with these specs right here
wow that is a super compact build though
I give him credit again maybe because
he's got that Razer logo on there and
just raises the price by $1,500 that's
all I can think of all right one hear
from a Markovski says gaming PC upgraded
$1200 it's an I buy power AMD FX 6300
processors got an RX 478 gig in there 16
gigs of ram I don't really care for the
power supply that's the only played csgo
h1 and pub battlegrounds does that mean
that like he can charge more for because
he only played these three games not too
bad the asking price is still ridiculous
$1200 unless he bought that rx 470 on
eBay for like $500 this is not a good
deal at all so that's all I've got for
this edition folks I appreciate those of
