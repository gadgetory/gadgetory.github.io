Hey
just kidding maybe someday this is dad's
out e r8 v10 a 5.2 liter 10 cylinder
sports car and it's very very fast
but it isn't all about speed it's about
beauty and design its contours rims
headlights paint job and iconic interior
I'll bring a sense of style to the
forefront this model here is only a 2011
but you'll find very consistent features
throughout the entire r8 lineup
regardless of the engine size speaking
of which the 5.2 liter v10 here is
capable of up to 525 horsepower and 391
pound-feet of torque
because this is a naturally aspirated
engine the power band is wide and strong
from 2 to 8,000 rpm 0 to 60 about 3.7
seconds only a fraction faster than the
coupe equivalent which saves
approximately 200 pounds convertibles
are typically heavier because they
require reinforced chassis to prevent
warping among other things now this next
one will give Treehugger something to
grimace about mpg it's a sports car what
can I say with this model year expect
about 13 miles per gallon in the city
and just over 20 on the highway and 93
octane is a must
ethanol free if possible ethanol
attracts water which in turn dilutes
fuel and corrodes engine blocks and
since sports cars typically have higher
compression ratios than their cheaper
alternatives they are the most adversely
affected by the compound perhaps the
only downside to this model the single
clutch coming from a Nissan GTR a single
clutch sports car is a solid drawback
out he didn't introduce the dual clutch
S tronic transmission until 2014 but it
radically transformed the car but I
digress back to style once again my
father owned a 2013 Nissan GTR before
trading it in for this some of you might
disagree with the choice but passed a
certain point it's not all about a 10
second quarter mile for others it's
about looking good while getting there
some wouldn't even know the GTR was
Godzilla just by looking at it on the
road but this Iron Man's machine and you
all know how I am about Iron Man
regardless of the model year in my book
you cannot go wrong with an Audi r8 I
just wish this one was mine
I also wish I could overclock this thing
but it's not a pc back to my roots if
you like this style video give this one
a thumbs up subscribe for more content
like this and stay tuned for a dope PC
build what a subject change it's called
diversity folks this is Salazar studio
thanks for driving with us
Oh hold on here what is that that a
