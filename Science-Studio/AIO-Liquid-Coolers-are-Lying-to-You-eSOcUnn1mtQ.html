it's true but allow me to explain let's
pretend a guy named Andy has been
sporting a cooler master hyper 212 Evo
for the past year he's satisfied with
its 4.7 gigahertz i7 7700 K temperatures
but wants to push the overclock a bit
higher right now his core temperatures
idle at around 30 °c and thing to jump
up to around 80 degrees Celsius
immediately after starting i-264
still not bad for a run-of-the-mill air
cooler but things could definitely be
better and he realizes this hops online
and decides to purchase an a io like
this one here the deep cool captain 240
X just insert your a IO liquid cooler of
choice these coolers use liquid let's
assume water with a few additives it's
usually what it is as a medium of
exchange between CPUs than the outside
world the water isn't making direct
contact with the CPU there's usually
nickel plated copper or an aluminum base
of sorts sandwiched in between but
nonetheless it's the water that
ultimately transfers heat away from the
source and in comes the radiator these
vary in size and fin density but
essentially reverse the process that
occurs at the block instead of heat
being transferred from metal to water
the radiator transfers heat from water
to metal and relies on installed fans to
dissipate or radiate heat into the
atmosphere but here's where the lye
begin
Andy removes his hyper 212 Evo installs
the AIO
let's assume a constant max pump speed
and a normal fan curve and immediately
checks idle temperatures much lower
right let's say 23 24 degrees Celsius
wouldn't make much sense for core temps
to be lower than room temperatures Andy
then runs the i-264
and notices that his immediate
temperature jumps are much more
controlled whereas his core temperatures
jump to 80 degrees Celsius before
they're only jumping to around 55
degrees Celsius now job well done right
the AIO was definitely worth it let's
see if he's still saying that in about
an hour or so in comes the misleading
nature of a iOS and comes specific heat
it's defined as the amount of energy
required to raise the temperature of a
substance by a single degree Celsius or
Kelvin it is often listed as an
intensive property with respect to mass
hence joules per gram Kelvin or joules
per
Graham Kelvin if we assume a copper
cooling system and a perfect translation
of energy from the CPU heat spreader to
the cooler space that's what thermal
glue seeks to do and the cooler in
question would be able to absorb only
point four joules of energy per gram of
copper before increasing in temperature
by a single degree Celsius so in a
nutshell copper heats up very fast it's
a thermal conductor and most metals
behave in this way this is why Andy sees
an immediate temperature jump with his
air cooler when he first starts out of
64 copper is absorbing energy at the
same rate that water would be in its
place but copper has a much lower heat
capacity which means it heats up quicker
it's absorbing a certain amount of
joules per second denoted as watts which
is where TDP comes into play and is
either passively or actively radiating
this heat water on the contrary has a
very high specific heat capacity which
means that it can absorb a substantial
amount of energy per unit mass before
increasing in temperature by a single
degree it's specific heat capacity
it's 4.2 joules per gram Kelvin nearly
10 times that of coppers as a relational
example picture is stove with a pot of
water if the pot is made of metal
usually a sort of stainless steel Teflon
combo the metal will heat up at a much
quicker rate than the water will not
only because the metal is in direct
contact with the stove but because it's
specific heat capacity is much lower
your cookware reaches water's boiling
point long before the water itself does
even though it's in direct contact with
the metal if both the water and alloy
had the same heat capacity
they'd heat up at the same rate and
reach water's boiling point at the same
time water's high heat capacity and low
viscosity make it an excellent coolant
in several applications including PCs
however ironic that may be but do not be
fooled
there are several misleading claims on
forums and even other YouTube channels
in regard to a iOS and they're ultra
cool yields the first has to do with
load testing when Andy first started
i-264
the a iOS temperature spike was much
more controlled if you recall 55 degrees
Celsius verse 80 degrees Celsius but
this isn't the entire story the entire
story would reveal the thermal property
differences between water and the metal
in question usually copper or aluminum
first off Andy's initial temperature
spikes were lowered because water
requires nearly ten times the energy to
reach the same temperature as the copper
in the air cooler not only that but the
Loup requires a length of time to
equalize I demonstrated this with
Heisenberg's i7 6700 K and the NZXT
kraken X 62 it took nearly 42 minutes
for the core temperatures to stabilize
much longer than a typical air cooler
whose respective core temps would
plateau much sooner you can verify this
yourself if you have your own air cooler
in your PC doesn't matter what size it
is your temperatures will peak in a few
minutes or so now this isn't to say that
a iOS are unnecessary that's not the
point of this video of course this a IO
from deep cool will better cool your CPU
than a hyper 212 Evo hands down it does
a better job at dissipating Heat plain
and simple but not only thanks to the
water involved also the 240 millimeter
radiator further down the loop what I am
trying to say is that a iOS are often
misunderstood because their testers are
often too impatient to wait for
temperatures to stabilize at least those
who are posting on forms all the time
that their temperatures drop by 40
degrees Celsius which is usually not the
case if you let those things run for a
couple hours with i-264 you'll find that
that Delta is much smaller I was
watching a video from Joker Productions
a few days ago he built a sweet new PC
and was discussing CPU temperatures
after running i-264 for just over an
hour he said on his 7700 K captain 240 x
combo his core temperatures leveled off
at around 75 degrees Celsius that's what
I want to hear he let the thing run for
more than just a few minutes 100%
necessary for liquid cooled systems the
t delta can be much lower for air cooled
systems because metals heat up rapidly
by contrast but in comes the other side
effect of a iOS the fact that they stay
hotter for longer after prolonged burnin
even if all Andy does is play video
games for a few hours at a time they
don't even have to be CPU intensive his
core temperatures will be higher for a
much longer time after returning to an
idle state because water tends to retain
heat much longer than most metals do
thermal diffusivity is a variable at
play here of which specific heat is a
function but without using numbers you
can test this yourself as well if you
heat up an equivalent mass of both iron
and water to the same temperature let's
say 80 degrees Celsius and then set each
aside to passively cool the iron will
reach room temperature again much faster
than the water so while water requires
more energy to reach a certain
temperature it all
wants to hold on to that temperature for
a longer amount of time which means that
your idle CPU temperatures could be in
the 40s or 50s long after you finish to
gaming running benchmarks or rendering
this isn't necessarily a bad thing it's
just a side effect of an AI oh you can
tweak fan curves to speed up this
process by the way it is something to
keep in mind though as it's often
overlooked by first-time users of closed
and even custom loop assemblies blue sky
will also have this problem but not to
any significant degree thanks to its two
large radiators you can't change the
properties of the compound but you can
change the environments in which the
compounds react if you liked this video
be sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs
down for the opposite be sure to click
the subscribe button if you haven't
already I will catch you in the next
video waiting to finish good old blue
