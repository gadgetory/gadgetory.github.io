purchased was an MSI board I bought it
because it looked awesome I loved the
black and red color scheme I bought it
with an unlocked chipset for an i3
processor that tells you anything about
how experienced I was at the time I just
thought the motherboard looked awesome
that was really all I cared about the
feature sets and what I'd be able to use
and what I wouldn't be able to use
really didn't matter other than how good
it looked in my case and your
motherboard should look good in your
case especially if you have a side panel
it's probably the biggest piece of
hardware in your entire build but what
if I told you that you can have both the
looks and feature support on the best
bargain platform out there all for under
a hundred US dollars do I have your
attention yet this is the MSI be 350
gaming plus built specifically for
rising 5 CPUs though any a m4 chip would
work fine including the upcoming Athlon
and a series AMD processors just a quick
glance and you're bound to fall in love
even if you hate the overused overdone
read aesthetic which I get it it is
overdone you've got to admit MSI nailed
it in the looks department here you
likely won't even notice the absent rear
i/o shield on the contrary your eyes are
drawn elsewhere on the board to the
quiescent but stated red streaks across
the PCB painted PCIe slots one of which
is still reinforced and the understated
MOSFET heat sinks up top
even the chipset spreader usually
covered by the graphics card mind you
looks phenomenal
it doesn't need any fancy LEDs or
something crazy to overstate its
presence on the contrary this is a board
built for both connoisseurs and amateurs
alike not only with price and
performance taken into consideration but
also those darn good looks if we could
fit this motherboard into a Venn diagram
it sit comfortably here rock-solid and
I'm not being paid to say these things
by the way I have never and will never
ever recommend a crap product period no
matter how much you try to pay me I know
I lose the trust of all of you it may
take five years to build integrity but
it takes five seconds to lose it now in
a sports case the positives do not just
stop with the looks in the performance
Department you get what you pay for and
then some
let's start with overclock ability
boasting the Rison 5 1600 CPU which mind
you is only a 65 watt TDP chip I was
able to hit 3.9 gigahertz comfortably I
strived for 4 but I blame this 65 watt
TDP
not the motherboard if you want four or
above with a six or higher core
processor on a rise inside then your
best bet is probably the better than
1600 X nonetheless this frequency is
what I'd expect with a be 350
motherboard also with Rison tuned to
ddr4 this board will support well above
3000 megahertz for slight framerate
bumps and games now on from that let's
talk about those feature sets first up
beautiful red LED accents spending
across the red streaks to the left of
the board also a little bit on the right
nothing too flashy though and instead of
dr. debug and a cost-saving measure MSI
has chosen dedicated LED notifications
for diagnosing problems with your CPU
graphics card and RAM you also get a
single MDOT two slot with this board as
well as solid 7.1 surround sound support
you'll find six fan headers plenty for a
board of this caliber two USB 2.0 hubs
and two 3.0 s one of these which i think
is super cool is actually oriented
sideways inline with the board in other
words you don't have to worry about an
ugly black USB 3.0 cable sprouting from
the motherboard next to your 24 pin to
keep this short and sweet I really have
no choice it's a motherboard review
video after all you can find additional
information via the link below it's also
tied to my Amazon affiliate account so
any purchase made via that link does
give me a small kickback helps me make
more videos like this one right here if
you have any additional questions don't
be afraid to hit that comment box down
below I make no secret of the fact that
I am a huge fan of this board both from
a price perspective as well as a
performance perspective you have a
Reisen v CPU don't to spend as much on
maybe an X 370 board but you still want
to be able to overclock you can still do
that with a be 350 board you keep that
in mind if it arrives in seven CPU not
really interested in some severe
overclocking this would still be a great
candidate for you with that if you liked
the video be sure to give it a thumbs up
thumbs down for the opposite e subscribe
if you haven't already and I'll catch
you in the next video something very
cool and it works
this is science studio thanks for
learning
