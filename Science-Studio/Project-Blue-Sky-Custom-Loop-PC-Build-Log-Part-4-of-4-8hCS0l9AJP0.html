that is thanks to Thermaltake so we were
waiting on the graphics card blocks to
get here from alpha cool they've had
some issues they were moving warehouses
and a bunch of other crap went on so I
went ahead reached out to Thermaltake
and Jack over a Thermaltake said that he
could send these over overnight they
sent these via UPS they some 5tn
yesterday and we have them now these are
beautiful thermal take water blocks for
reference reference PCB GTX 1080s of
which our EVGA cards are using we have
two of them we also have an SLI bridge
here if we want to use that but we might
not but these are just gorgeous
I actually think these look better than
the optical blocks just saying that
there you can see through them and you
know the intricacy here is beyond belief
I love the way they look so we're going
to put these on we're gonna install
these and then we're going to run the
tube and should be good to go with
starting up blue sky for the first time
running some leak tests and yes that's
it go ahead and start assembling the
water box I'll also do a review of the
PCO 11 for those interested that will be
up after we actually finish assembling
project blue sky this case is I mean it
has a lot of space in it I think it's
very strategically laid out it is on the
expensive side but you get me pay for
tempered glass aluminum steel
construction and obviously plenty of
room for a custom loop like this one
there's one GT X 1080 it is extremely
dirty in here right now alright and
there's our second GT X 1080 so now
we're going to pull off the ACX cooler
here and install that acrylic I think
it's acrylic an acrylic block on the PCB
so you know what we're doing here right
no you don't
are you wondering where this is going to
go okay so this this HDX cooler here
there's a bunch of a fin and their fans
here so the fins basically conduct the
heat generated from the GPU the VRMs
vram stuff like that and then these fans
help dissipate the heat from those fins
we're taking off this entire thing down
to just the search
bored which is this lighter color strip
here and then we're going to smack this
block like right where the cooler or the
air cooler is now hmm
and we go see that now the thermal pads
here gave this bag played a bit of
function so it hope to absorb a bit of
the heat okay so you can see here this
is the GTX 1080 reference PCB down to a
just a bare board here and next comes
thermal take water block installation
you
so kind of at the halfway point here for
part four say I've got the the tubes
running from the reservoir to the GPU
block and they're been running from here
to the CPU block everything else was
pretty much good to go before and I did
redo this bend and I also did this bend
over again as well so that one's much
smoother as are these a kind of like 30
degree bends up top so I'm going to
double check everything make sure that
the settings are on secure everything is
just good to go that I can see up front
and then I'm going to add some cool it
now I was I was really debating going
with something opaque like this or going
with the stuff I showed in the last
video in this video right here that UV
coolant
this I think is going to match better
but it's not going to look as
crystalline oh there's supposed to be
like crystal meth that's what blue sky
is named after in Breaking Bad the blue
sky was the street name for the
methamphetamine a Heisenberg cooked but
I think I think for aesthetic purposes
I'm going to go with the opaque coolant
I think it's just going to be a better
choice in terms of what it's going to
match it's kind of a good blend between
other CPU block up top and the light
blue cables and the graphics card
backplate so that's what I'm going to go
with and this you know this is just
something that I think will pay off in
the long run worst case I'll flush but
the fluid out and I'll replace it later
on but I think this is going to be a
better bet so now I'll have to do
instead of lining UV strips I'll just
line probably just a single white LED
strip going down this little corner post
here and that'll be it worst case other
one up top if it's to them but I want
kind of like a minimalist lighting
perspective being that this will be the
corner that'll be closest to me to be
equivalently right here I think it would
be cool just kind of see how the light
spreads out over the case so I'm going
to turn the PC around for a bit I'm
going to kind of wire I get a fan hub
here going to wire all these fans for
the radiators up make sure everything
else is good to go and we will add the
coolant and I'll try to
get as much slow-mo footage as possible
because I know that's what you folks are
looking forward to
you
okay so it's like 2:45 a.m. I'm talking
with my man Tony over there on the PC
say hi Tony
oh yeah that's Tony so we've been kind
of conversing about this this custom
loop here of course you just saw the
leak that we had with this fitting right
here and then on top of that once that
was finished and Tony can be my witness
here the power supply stopped working
just out of nowhere I was kind of
switching it on and off getting the pump
a disciple through the fluid and I
turned it on once and the pump wouldn't
turn on I thought it was just a bad
cable or something swap it out
still nothing so then I bring over the
testbench thermal take test bench and
this is a 800 850 watt RGB a B+ cooled
power supply this thing works perfect
and pump is on right now you see the
fluids a turning through the loop so we
just had a thousand watt p2 power supply
from EVGA died on us I'm going to call
it quits this is still going to be the
end of part four and the end of the
series of the blue sky billed part for
project blue sky did not end the way I
thought it would but uh I mean she
finished she's just not looking pretty
right now it's like a car without paint
basically or without that it's like a
car without wheels tires that's more
like it
this is Salazar studio I'm going to
sleep thanks for building with us I
think we'll go with that one
