Squarespace look folks domain website
online store it really doesn't matter
what you need you can do it all over at
squarespace.com tack on a forward slash
science studio to get 10% off your first
purchase it's linked in this video's
description I'd like to preface this
playlist with a bit of insight into why
I even bother making these types of
videos these aren't science videos per
se they're just street smart videos if
you're a new to PCC building and you're
interested in buying a new or used PC
and either market then I recommend
watching a video like this if you're
gonna shop on Facebook on Craigslist on
ebay anywhere else in the world for a
used PC especially be aware of when
you're being scammed that's not to say
that everyone out there is going to rip
you off in fact I would argue that more
people than not are going to be
genuinely interested in selling you a
component a PC or something along those
lines for a decent price because they
know that it's either been just devalued
over time or they need the cash quickly
so what I'm gonna show you mostly bad
deals there are a few good ones that I
found but Facebook marketplaces it's
littered with some garbage so that's
what this video is
I read terrible ads facebook marketplace
edition by popular demand alright so
we're gonna jump right into this now for
those who are not familiar Facebook
marketplace is basically Craigslist just
pretend it's Craigslist but anybody
anywhere can sell anything first on our
list this is a fifteen hundred dollar
asking price gaming PC from Pensacola
Florida a 50 watt power supply AMD FX
6300 and r9 390 volcano graphics card
he's got a 250 gig SSD okay not too bad
16 gigs of ram but there's really
nothing appealing here and I'm not sure
where he's getting the $1500 asking
price what do you have next year okay
custom-built gaming and developer
workstation PC asking price twenty eight
hundred and thirty-five dollars from
Dothan Alabama this is an oddly specific
price for this PC and good game you got
yourself in the shot there this PC
utilizes the MDOT 2 specification for
its hard drive that's not a hard drive
that's an MDOT - it's a solid-state
drive which means it's nearly 100 times
faster than any HDD you can buy current
Preval computers don't even compare with
MDOT to available because it's such a
new technology down to the specs i7 7700
K GTX 10
32 gigs of tread NZ ddr4 one terabyte
him got to okay he didn't cheap out on
the m-dot - that's for sure
we got an H X 850 850 watt power supply
you put it in a 570 X from Corsair
that's really the extent of the build
though and he's asking for nearly three
grand just in case you're new to pcs
terrible deal here we go four hundred
and fifty dollar gaming PC for low to
medium games gtx 660 eight gigs of ram
not sure what the cpu is you should
probably list that if you're gonna sell
a computer like this that looks like an
AMD cooler so i'm gonna assume maybe
like an FX 6300 or FX 4300 i can't
really tell
all this is good though can throw in the
320 gig hard drive for the right price
that the hard drives gonna cost like ten
dollars Jesus alright let's go on
yukio cards for in gaming pcs pretty
straight up about he's not trying to be
sly or anything I'm not sure what the
value of these yugioh cards are I
haven't played in a long time but 420
bucks should get him a decent starter
rig if you can find some used parts
that's really all I wanted to show you
here it's pretty funny alright what do
we have here 2500 dollar gaming PC this
rig can play in 1440p at no ease and
also 4k 6700 K at 4.5 gigahertz intel
SSD 400 gig hard drive it's not a hard
drive though it's an SSD there's a
difference hard drives are not solid
state drives totally different 16 gigs
of ram 750 watt power supply in a GTX
1080 alright but I'm looking for what he
has in this rig that's making him come
to the conclusion that it's worth $2,500
I know I thought this one was pretty
cool at first glance he's got an i7 7700
K in there - GTX 1080 T eyes and NZXT
s340 elite custom loop looks really
clean right and then I found out that
he's only including one graphics card
when you buy it with only 110 atti sorry
dude not gonna cut it custom yeah me PC
workstation computer Intel Core i5 set I
don't know if you can call a computer
with an i5 in it a workstation PC seems
a little clickbait D to me 3/8 gig
sticks of RAM nothing wrong with that is
just kind of weird
1070 at 760 T case a 1 terabyte SSD a CX
850 M power supply
he's including Windows 10 that's good 8
fans and let's see I don't think he's
including this 144 Hertz for
okay monitor no he's not no apparently
he sells them on the side interesting
$2,200 my conclusion is nay what is this
pc parts i7 gaming pc alright so the CPU
motherboard must be sold together that
kind of makes sense right I 747 90 K and
an ASUS Maximus hero 7 so he wants 270
bucks for that this is actually a pretty
solid deal here that i7 that's as well
but you could still probably squeak out
around 200 bucks that's I think a fair
price for an older i7 but even that has
well if not that old so anywhere in the
two hundreds is solid for an i7 plus
he's including the motherboard basically
free of charge or just really cheap
which is nice I wonder if he's including
the RAM no because that's not in this
list maybe he's just moving that to a
different build but that alone just the
two hundred seventy dollars for that
combo is pretty cool $750 gaming PC in
Tallahassee Florida can run many games
at Mac settings you know this is good
when he starts the whole ad off with
this sentence here 16 gigs of ram FX
8350 kind of saw that coming
and let's see he's got an NVIDIA GTX 660
and a GT 610 was using one for physics
850 pro 256 gig SSD in a 1.8 terabyte
hard disk drive $750 is not gonna cut it
what do we have here t 5810 gaming PC
pretty sure that's a Xeon rig that's
that's a server build not necessarily a
gaming rig I'll have to double check on
that 64 gigs of ram sounding more like a
server than anything else one terabyte
solid-state drive and a gtx 1070 video
card prices not negotiable
this whole built just doesn't make sense
Oh what with that classic UV green
coolant did we up for sale here is a PC
I built from the ground up building
computers for almost 20 years and let's
see Plasti Dip the case so you put a lot
of time and effort in this had Plexiglas
custom cut LGA 48 20 K 16 gigs of course
there Dom Platts she's got two 980 s an
SLI interesting an issue sorry gee
grandpa ch4 Black Edition LGA 2011
motherboard and a bunch of fans he's got
a course there HX 1000 I for absolutely
no reason
250 gigabytes Samsung SSD 840 pro I'm
more or less just concerned about the
value of the custom loop gear I'm
wondering if he's accounting for all
those costs or a piece kind of given us
a discount here it'd be difficult to
break it all down but he's got a lot of
stuff going on in here I don't recommend
anyone looking to buy a PC pre-built go
with a custom loop rig it's just it's
really hard for me to recommend that
because this is gonna require so much
maintenance in the long run this is a
gaming PC and monitor McKinney Texas
$1,000 bought this gaming PC and monitor
in June just don't use anymore okay
works great
we'll send specs to serious buyers are
you kidding me why on earth would you
even bother posting an ad if you're not
gonna list of specifications really it's
just more work for both of us just make
it simple I'm gonna assume this is just
a terrible bill because you're too shy
to put the specs on screen brand-new
high-end gaming desktop this is uh it's
actually near my hometown Panama City
Beach Florida $2,000 amazing
custom-built gaming desktop this will
shred any game and it's ready for 4k
gaming or VR i7 7700 K gigabyte gaming
motherboard a little sketched out though
by the motherboard because it doesn't
look like a top to your board I'm
curious as to whether or not that is
even a Z 270 board it might be a be 250
board mapa check he's got one 16 gig
stick of ddr4 little strange three
terabyte hardest drive 500 gig SSD a
gigabyte horas 1080 is 650 watt power
supply you plus and the Corsair crystal
460 X oh but check this out he hasn't
installed it yet but he's planning on
putting in a nice Wi-Fi card I love this
I got a ramp for a second here never
been overclocked or abused so you're
telling me that you have a 7700 can you
rigged with an aftermarket CPU cooler
and you never tinkered with the
overclock either that or this guy's
doing the same thing the guy in the last
video did he just paired an unlocked CPU
with a locked chipset so he can't
overclock even if he wants to we got a
custom 4k gaming PC from would--we Texas
$59 asking price but this one I did a
little research beforehand he actually
priced it out fairly so he can I 570 600
K which will do decent in games not the
best but it's close to GTX 10 80s and
SLI and then he's got what 2 terabytes
of hard disk drives in raid 0 this is
the two on the basement and he's got a
120 gig SSD for the operating system in
zxd Kraken X 52 and he's accepting
paypal for those interested yeah I gotta
say this one really isn't a bad deal if
you want to buy a monitor from he's also
selling that
so I want to hit this guy up seriously I
mean for the two graphics cards alone
especially what the mining craze the way
it is
although graphics card prices are
starting to go down just a little bit at
least in the 1080 side because they're
not the best mining cards
hache per watt anyway this is still a
decently priced PC now to end this video
I want to show you how I was searching
through Facebook Marketplace maybe want
to do something similar on your channel
or just in your spare time find some
decent deals out there they do exist on
this on this site you can sign in to
your Facebook account it is required
actually to do anything here if you
don't sign in and it's not gonna let you
search it will probably pull your
location we can search really anywhere
so let's type in Seattle Washington and
there we go now you can type in what
you're looking for let's do gaming pc
and the top searches should have to do
with what you were looking for here we
go this is a juicy one so ultimate
gaming pc 4k and virtual reality ready
GT x 1080 custom loop so you see my
point super simple to use I invite you
to just give it a shot see what you can
find in your local area so we've seen
the good the few that I showed of the
bad there were plenty of those to choose
from and the ugly now what I want you to
do this is my call to action in this
video is to go on to your local Facebook
market place hype in gaming PC or
something along those lines and see what
kind of deals you can find if any exist
at all my takeaway from this Facebook
market place it's got a lot of crap I'd
say as much if not more crap than
Craigslist and that's saying something
if you liked this video be sure to give
this one a thumbs up I do appreciate
that also leave suggestions for future
