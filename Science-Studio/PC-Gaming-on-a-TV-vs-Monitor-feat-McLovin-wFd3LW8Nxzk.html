McLovin is actually on his way I want to
do an experiment but what I did was I
purchased a 55 inch 4k Ultra HD TV
it's a vizio to the e-series I'll have
the let's see yeah that's the model
number right there and I purchased it
for 420 bucks at Sam's great deal it was
a one-day sale I had to pick one up it
was just it was just too good to resist
and you get that 4k 55 inches needless
to say it was a great Buy
now McLovin is going to be gaming on
this TV right here which we know is you
know most TVs are notorious for input
lag and then we're gonna have him game
on a 144 Hertz 1440p pick CEO monitor
which should be much better than the TV
now Jacob stirlitz if he knew to pc
gaming we just built his PC couple days
ago actually you're interested in that
series you can check it out right here
but I want to see without telling him
what will happen before he plays if he
notices that input lag that's something
that people who play PC games quite a
bit already know about if you swap from
something like a monitor to a TV just in
general you'll notice the the lag time
if you tell your character to move left
it will take a noticeably longer amount
of time for that character to move left
on a TV than in a monitor so with that
let's let's start setting things up he's
about to walk in and then we'll we'll
let him take it from there
yeah I get your controller all right
Jacob button yeah playing some video
games all right yeah I'm you playing
video games in okay so we have the
computer hooked up to the 55 inch 4k TV
shoutout to visi over this awesome
remote because remote I have never seen
a more pitiful remote there aren't even
arrows on the teeth on the remote look
at that you get that's that's more basic
than its like super mario nintendo 64
except on a Vizio like it doesn't even
slide out either there's no keyboard
there's nothing I set up the Faro wrong
oh this is weird this is really really
it's so trippy like it's so much more up
well I'm normally really good at this
but apparently I'm not I think wait to
get on the other screen it's so dang big
so touchy and with it Oh pop pop Wow
oh look it's already goes back up to 60
all right turn out ooh that is way
better
that is way better okay so Jacob has
just started playing black ops 3 for the
first time ever ever on a 144 Hertz
monitor and Jacob I want your raw
impressions while you're playing wait
what you think I mean it's it's the best
flight screen I've ever played on it's
so touchy this is just so responsive I
mean everything about it so we just
switched a single time
ah so what'd you say in this scenario it
would be better to have a lower
sensitivity yeah higher my goodness oh
dude this is better word i baby feeling
it ah little spray out action but now
this is like I mean this is like this is
so good it just seems so easy to like it
so fluent fluent Jesus fluent Jacob
polluted fluid good God didn't get that
right up there's a lot more than I
expected
so what were the difference is what did
you notice
with the TV compared to that of the
monitor what were the differences there
I mean like the lag time it's like it
just frustrates like that what do you
mean by that whenever I like
just with movement it seems that I would
actually hit the analog stick in one
direction and you can just it hesitates
you can tell that it's taking its time
so by the time I can react I'm already
dead with the computer monitor it's like
instantaneous it's as soon as I start to
move it's reacting so I can actually
play as fast as I can move my fingers as
far as the TV you have to like
second-guess yourself because everything
is so slow that you have to like make a
second decision with the monitor it's
like you it's just instantaneous you can
just sit there and you know if you're
gonna take a right you're gonna move
right then you don't have to like
second-guess yourself I don't know how
did you feel about playing on a smaller
screen versus a larger one for that kind
of game I personally like smaller
screens I always have how do you perform
in first-person shooters with a small
screen versus a large one little way
better way better so smaller screens are
actually beneficial for those went up
well back when I played black ops one I
actually bought a vizio 32 inch and it
was too big so I actually went back to a
really crappy 19-inch really crappy TV
and it was just it's so much easier to
like play on and that's what I went
through all of high school so the 55
inch is a is definitely a no from black
ops 3 yeah yeah I mean just like the lag
time was just like ridiculously crappy
just like by the time I actually started
to move like I'm already like oh crap I
know I'm gonna die like you know that's
like oh okay yep they're cons like just
it just it frustrates me that it takes
so long for it to respond although we're
in milliseconds mm-hmm no it's a place
in milliseconds it's just so angry
noticeable yeah you can just sit there
and you tell you're like if this is a
little bit quicker or if it responded
faster I could have killed him which if
you're a gamer you know it's like the
most frustrating thing ever
I've rage quitted a bunch of times
before so let me tell you so Jacob
here's something I didn't I didn't tell
you before I mean I
tell you about the response time issue I
wanted to see what you thought of both
before I actually told you what would
happen because I already knew the TV
would be that the less the the less
desirable of the two Harvard but here's
but here's that here's the thing that I
didn't tell you you can purchase both of
those screens back there for about the
same price
I haven't actually gone out and bought a
computer monitor because I thought my TV
monitor would do just as fine but now
that I personally gone through both and
seeing what a computer monitor can do
compared to a TV I'm just going to go
put the TV back and just go buy a
computer monitor I think it's funny when
you pulled up when you when you turned
on the 4k TV and started playing with it
I mean it's a big screen so I think that
was that was part of the issue but you
didn't really complain much about the
lag time which may which leads me to
assume that you were kind of already
used to oh I'm that's all I'm used to at
lag time so whenever I switched over to
the monitor it just amazes me that I'm
not having to deal with other
electronics that I'm already having to
deal with crappy internet connection so
that's one thing that pisses me off and
then another thing that kind of pisses
me off is when I know that I'm moving
the joysticks but it's not responding
how I needed to I can actually play the
game of how fast I can react so I don't
have to like wait for the TV to react
it's my reaction time it's that quick so
if I'm moving the joystick it's moving
with how fast I'm moving it everything
is just so fluid it's ridiculous
I mean it's next to none I mean that TV
monitor I've had in my house and
probably a trash it's just such garbage
but is it now that you've seen the light
yeah I mean I think Greg's right like
I'm used to the reaction time of a TV so
when I got onto the TV I probably didn't
complain because it's like yeah I'm used
to like really crappy reaction time or
lag time so actually playing on a
computer monitor was just I mean it's
the amount of reaction time and just how
quick it can react it's incredible just
the fluidity fluidity oh my god who did
it do digiti it's just so much clearer
that's a wrap folks thanks for watching
like I said I kind of expected him to
say something
like that but uh that's it if you play
first-person shooters especially you
will notice the lag associated with a TV
and if you play with something like a
gaming monitor this pic Co monitor
behind us 144 Hertz refresh rate afford
millisecond response time and Jacobs
head's kind of in the way and a 1440p
resolution as long as you have the
horsepower to drive those frames you
will have a very enjoyable first-person
shooter experience this is my uh my PC
to support this you got 144 Hertz 4k
yeah check out this video right here
folks let me know if you think that
computer will will support a 14-4 degree
views it's not making fun of it so it
doesn't matter
editing rig don't forget cheap it we are
going to be bringing you new footage of
gaming that's right we are bringing back
our high school days and we're gonna
take you with us that's right I'm
talking black ops 1 Guitar Hero grand
theft auto and other stuff so sit back
relax his we're gonna do it for you
what's the name of that channel Jacob
it's called entertainment studio who uh
who came up with that name kind of both

I've ever had no I'm not I didn't tell
you to say this right now fix you to
tell saying this now I mean I really now
it's really incredible I mean actually
well also Greg's pcs like next to none
so I'm sure mine may be able to support
how much I wanted to but just three
in total of course not or why would I
think that but the reaction time was
incredible I need one like I need one
like I'll even send you like a little
bumper sticker that says some club in
