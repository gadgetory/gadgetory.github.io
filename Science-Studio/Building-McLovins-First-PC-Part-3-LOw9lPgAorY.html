everybody do I want the best for you all
right for anyone let's watch this
channel this is a Greg serious face we
have a great being serious
this is his face look at Stevie's he
looked he wouldn't possibly want to
screw McLovin out of his new PC woody oh
it's actually a Jim I got into a
graphics card
there we are my god Greg it's just
wedged in there Oh people are gonna not
be seeing this actually you never know
can we please do like a montage at the
end of this video where it's like like
we're trying to be serious with like how
good it looks and play like really weird
dubstep music it's got like chopped up
vocals in it
can we do that really good yeah like
it's like it's like we're like trolling
people thinking that it's like you know
one of the best pcs ever built and it's
like actually completely trash could we
please do that you got the part they
just broke oh dude sweet they bring
stickers oh no they're not stickers I'm
gonna say we're about to sticker this
bad boy up
looks like like a radiator from like a
1905 like Ford t-bucket for these thank
you did you plug it up yeah most um most
of them except for one what's the one
the hard drive led what well it's only
the it only shows up up I'll show you
what I want the hard drive led I think
the most subliminal thing you've ever
seen it what does it do it just it's a
little tiny little light up here it goes
baby yeah I want that if your heart
that's working when are you ever gonna
use that I don't know I just agree cool
be cool your great love is getting
poorer
I also replaced the LED fan bag I
noticed that piece of crap like cheap
black well it's not even name branded
it's just a dude out of all of these
boxes that you have yeah okay including
you on the foul yeah you didn't want to
give me a fan that was decent no okay
I'm giving you a $150 case and a water
cooler radiator that for nothing I'm not
even charging you for them I
no and I never hated that radiator I
bought yeah that was an expensive
radiator $100 I'm giving you all my fuck
oh yeah oh yeah look at it I cannot wait
for this montage video yeah we got
attention color this is color it now oh
yeah oh yeah green baby I see yellow
that's like whatever
it's green I do like this this is
actually kind of nice yeah that looks
well Wow
okay are you kidding me Greg this looks
like it's for like 2006 because it's my
lot this is my old uh this is my old
tested so I used this before right it's
this good on real data on it keep going
okay folks we're using a phone to film
for this segment of the video I'm sorry
I thought I had both camera batteries
charged but apparently neither of them
were McLovin started filming and then
five seconds into the shot battery just
gave out so we're using the phone for
now but we we have the build set up Jay
go ahead and show them yeah oh yeah you
can totally see just me in this
reflection but that's fine like all you
can see with me ah yeah let's get your
green there yeah I got that green kind
of hides the hideousness of everything
else
oh yeah Vance was pumped in Davey I just
moving alright okay and we have Windows
10 already installed we have NZXT cam
software so able to change the led to
that nice-looking what do you call it
Monster Energy green yeah that's what
I'm talking about baby
so this is an on overclockable CQ in the
sense that we can't just up a multiplier
and have a higher frequency of the
result we have to over plug these in the
base clock meant that what we're looking
at stock right now our core temperatures
that are hovering around room
temperature Jacob we're about to stress
yourseif you for the first time we're
going to use a program called Cinebench
which is right here in some icon and
that Cinebench will basically give your
your CPU a score for example my bill
that you saw plenty of when you're at my
house scored about a thousand see
I think the highest I got was like 10:10
CB okay that was a 340 issue dollar
processor so given that your CP was
about 5 bucks how how well do you think
yours will score 244 I think it's wrong
to port like I'm thinking strong 244 I
think you're being a bit optimistic I
think with this 30-something inch TV
we're gonna I say 244 TV is nothing to
do this I don't I know 244 go 244 strong
234 right here she goes
as I'm gonna load you still think 244
this thing is running so quick right
look at this I'll fix a picture does a
picture take up the whole black box yeah
244 yeah I think I've seen this a couple
of times my guess
i bench mark this before i couldn't
remember what we just core it on it but
you can check that out in the video
right here if you're interested but
don't look over there because it's not
gonna be wearable but I'm expecting
somewhere around 180 190 CV I think
maybe 190 if you're lucky you have an
overclock yet so remember these are
stopped and they were rang a two point
yet 2.9 gigahertz those are great
what'd I say 244 what does that say oh
my goodness all my goodness great are
you feeling right now Greg oh my
goodness 244 did I not call that are you
kidding me
like are you kidding me I'm not kidding
you apparently look Oh
what were you saying Greg Lee you should
be screwing 180 like maybe one ending
skip are just just a little my goodness
know that I'm being honest with my
viewers I will include this entire
segment of the footage I'm not gonna act
like I didn't even Linda got it right
okay mmm yeah I was clearly wrong here
I'll use for better at a stock frequency
you scored better than Bo did with his Q
6600 the video which will be coming up
very soon by the way he didn't even get
that school with an overclocked to Q
6600 that's right that's impressive
actually for a $5 CPU oh yeah look at
this
I'm on the board baby online
take a look at this yeah feeling it in a
super cool baby
super cool yeah
so we raised the frequency of the CPU
its base frequency from 200 it was at
stock to 221 times a log multiplier of
14.5 gives us almost exactly thirty-two
hundred megahertz 3.2 gigahertz from our
stock 2.9 gigahertz that we originally
vented that you just saw so with that in
mind we have no nothing utilizing the
CPU let's go ahead and run some inch
again and see if we can - can't hit that
300 mark we probably won't with this
with this current frequency but we're
going to keep pushing this thing because
we do have that beast cooler is
completely unnecessary so what's your
estimate I'm thinking 280 285 ah if it
scales when I think it will I must say
278 so 278 285 okay might we'll be back
to you when it stops I said 278 I
haven't worked over 1 or 278 - 78
what is it oh yeah man
I'll ring you this thing 300 so we're
gonna hop back into the BIOS and we're
going to increase that base frequency
from a 221 I think we're gonna go to 240
this time we're going to up the voltage
a bit which we can do with this
motherboard and then hopefully hit that
300 CV market so at this point we have
our CPU clock address this is
essentially our base clock frequency if
you will then we have a PCI you want to
leave that under that's fine the CPU
multiplier if you look here the
multipliers log so we can't go any
higher than 14.5 so no matter what I try
to change this - it's like it just
that's as high as waiting up fourteen
fourteen point five so we do have a
locked multiplier it's not a black
edition CPU but we still can change our
CPU base clock frequency so at 221 times
fourteen point five we're getting just
over 3.2 gigahertz I believe so now
we're going to do 240 what's 240 times
fourteen point five I don't know he's
like we're going to 45 and one other
thing I'm going to do just in
because I don't want to undergo this
thing and I don't want to just crash on
us randomly I'm gonna give it some extra
juice or bump it up by 200 and let's do
150 no volts I don't know what the base
voltage is like what you're finding it's
stock but I don't know if those uh when
you increase the frequency of your CPU
you have to accommodate that by
increasing voltage typically sometimes
you have some Headroom past a certain
point if no way we're going to that
enough voltage to keep up the frequency
but at what we're running it currently
3.95 3.4 gigahertz 150 plus over the
stock it should be okay it's not well
reset seamless we'll try again yeah I
think I think we're okay at at this
configuration I say 301 Greg what do you
feeling oh you can get one today 301
yeah 300 up what is this oh it's like
the price is right yeah what is this
time you hungry I hope it's 302 for
anything hi oh yeah I'm feeling strong
301 filling 299 oh yeah oh my goodness
all I dislike is this like I recorded
this whole thing - oh my god you you to
be letting Gregg look at this for
knowing nothing about computers - like
all about it oh my goodness I need to
get a lottery ticket we literally we
need to go buy a lottery ticket right
now I can't believe you got it on the
dot
I said 300 I was still so close to you
oh my goodness to beat me oh I'm feeling
it this thing's gonna be flying when we
get done okay so the overclocking of 4
gigahertz didn't didn't go there how old
did I go great so not well at all so
we're gonna have to reset CMOS well now
the glasses off we can actually get like
good footage and we can see the blue
motherboard yeah that is a drawback but
that one is not on Giggy and X cubed
NZXT looks good floating okay now let's
see one of these files is 4 gigabytes so
we're gonna try to import this 4 gig
file in
- Adobe Premiere Pro you I'm worried
give you a crash just to be right
oh great what is it oh my god for all
those haters out there look how good
it's working so yes this computer can
multitask 112 you yeah so what are your
impressions so far of how the computer
is handling everything you expect to be
able to do on it well from what you were
telling me the whole entire time I
expected a lot better but what were they
telling you oh yeah this plays 4k videos
like a dream I did not say that like
yeah part 1 or part 2 after we went to
Best Buy you like oh yeah this thing you
can handle 4k at 60 frames per second
I'm like okay this is great hi Jill I
was joking that card is definitely not
capable of handling poor kid 60p but
other than that actually I'm kind of
surprised to be honest with you but I
thought I did a lot better than I was
anticipating especially loading this I
thought it what do you got honestly I
thought of crash okay so it's finished
now yeah all right Tom just posted to
here okay
so it looks like you can still edit at a
half the native resolution now I put two
full and let's see if the computer can
handle full yeah Jacob looks like you
can handle full 1080p 30p footage and
it's a full resolution we need to go to
4k full 4k full baby and to win it now
we want this exported in the YouTube
h.264 formats so click h.264
that took a while you know here I go all
the way down far down is it ere we go
YouTube 1080p pause what I'm talking
about
alright so we are about to export in
1080p pull this up a little more and
okay for some reason it's squished
anyway we're at 30 P you can see the
dimensions here and we're gonna hit
export it's underneath the what is all
this oh no no that's like all of them
have been like the estimated time
remaining so for a one-minute video file
we're looking at a render time of
roughly roughly 2 minutes based on what
Adobe Premiere is so it's telling us
it's a quick I don't know this is quick
I have no idea but hey that render time
is actually not bad at all and no your
laptop would not perform this well I've
seen the specs of your laptop it's
pretty good isn't it no it's not look
this is OK this is what you'll have to
deal with when I'll be like a 10-minute
video it's gonna take like an hour now
it'll take about 25 minutes I got stuff
to do drag I'm still young
then multitask this is a good this is a
good time this is impressive so at a
basic 1080p 30 P looking it about 2
minutes for every 1 minute of video
footage and that's exporting in the
YouTube 1080p preset so not bad are you
satisfied
I'm actually pretty satisfied it looks
cool I think my mom's gonna be on way
more than I am that's the live with my
mother
alright see videos been exported well
that's all we really needed to test was
just how quick it would take to a render
you know a sizable file one minutes not
a lot but we can extrapolate that
roughly to you know about two minutes
for every one minute of footage you know
I mean that's pretty good I mean it's a
lot quicker than I expected by the way
we hooked up the the fans on the
radiator as well as the three chassis
fans up to the included fan huh but with
the entities case so now right now
they're on low if we turn it to high all
fans will turn on high simultaneously so
Jacob are you satisfied overall oh I'm
satisfied so I want to get your opinions
uh what you think about the case how
much money you spent and what your
expectations were and where those
expectations met exceeded under exceeded
following my previous video or people
thought I said tenth instead of tint I
do like tinted
glass so I do like to look at that
negatives on it
good gone now this is a reflection it
really but other than that it's a lot
quieter than I expected it to be am
actually surprised that it ran YouTube
videos as quick as it did that that was
my neighbor one feature of this whole
entire bill is like I can run stuff a
lot quicker for the money I bought
according to the comments that people so
rudely put in I don't know I don't know
how much these cost
I guess I got a really good deal on like
the power supply and then I guess like
the SSDI you got you got ripped on the
SSD of course we didn't press much
that's by scrutiny again guys what's the
first thing I totally wanted yeah Best
Buy scrutiny before Emily screwed me
again you kind of screwed yourself
though we didn't price match the p-n
wine SSE we could have hey no I wasn't
spending the money and thought to you
man
I'm glad you can't see the motherboard
yeah the motherboard is I know it's hard
to tell because it is reflective glass
you're pretty much seeing everything
behind me but you cannot see the
motherboard with this current LED setup
which is great so the board looks black
you can't see the mix match colors that
we're going on that Foxconn board
they're gonna appreciate that oh god oh
god Greg really right at the end
literally right when we started filming
so this means that the the overclock was
pretty dirty so we're gonna you have to
lower your over Paul really okay so
we'll just lower your clock speed from
let's see two forty five megahertz base
to 230 okay I don't know what that comes
out to frequency wise but uh should
notice that much more performance to cut
yeah of course Vaughn
alright I'm gonna try to have Jacob and
the video like I usually do so I've seen
like three of your videos so wow really
with a thumbs up if you thought it was
cool
uh-huh or give it a thumbs down if you
hate life no if you isn't that it you
give them the option okay now you say
give it a thumbs up if you thought the
video is cool give it a thumbs down if
you feel the complete opposite give it
the thumbs down or or if you hate
everything about not just like
everything about
life getting them sponsoring somebody
like oh I'm so to start over I give it a
thumbs up if give this video with on
dunphy video a thumbs up if you liked it
or you know giving thumbs down if you
did like it or hate everything about
life click the subscribe link the
subscribe button it's not I'm not
putting it there if you haven't already
watch retarded oh no Saul so stupid this
is sound studio thanks for letting like
- thanks for don't don't skip over sighs
thank you for this is McLovin signing
off a science studio stay tuned for more
content at sign cities thanks for
subscribing thanks for learning with
this was it Bill Nye the Science Guy no
just just say thanks for looks for
learning let the restart restart they go
thanks for learning with us that's all I
