the tech space at least has something to
do with computers and that's great for
taxes but it's also great for satisfying
our morbid curiosities and I'll be
honest I had a lot of hope going to this
one at least you see I've been preaching
the used graphics card market for months
videos like these have been popping up
in the channel a lot recently the
cryptocurrency craze is settled
essentially miners are selling off in
large quantities and that's dropping
prices all across the board with respect
to graphics cards up to about three
generations back now I just bought four
rx5 80s I made no secret of that on
Twitter and what I'm gonna do in this
video is run two of them in crossfire
and yeah we're gonna see how that goes
this video is brought to you by privacy
calm in a nutshell privacy calm allows
you to purchase things online using
virtual debit card numbers instead of
real ones this is useful especially if
you plan on ordering some sites with
questionable security standards and it's
still peace of mind for the popular
online retailers like Amazon and Newegg
privacy calm boasts the same security
standards as your bank and split key
encryption ensures no single person can
access your data by the way you can
download the browser extension and have
it autofill the info for any of your
virtual cards like this it's super
simple secure and best of all 100% free
since they make money on the merchant
side like that of credit card companies
you have to try via the link below or by

toward your first purchase the word
crossfire probably triggered some of you
as with the acronym SLI and the tech has
a bad rap for a reason noteworthy titles
have avoided adding the support
altogether and it's a shame really
because III thought that I had something
here in this video so here was my goal I
talked about the gtx 1080 in the past
and how they're going for around 300
bucks on ebay they still are by the way
but i was interested in pushing the
value notion to the brink at what point
you stop seeing huge returns like these
for 300 bucks this is an insane deal but
how cheap can we go a hundred bucks 200
bucks we on to the 200 ollar gtx 1070
rocks socks off of any budget build it's
a heck of a value if you're willing to
take that risk but there aren't many
other cards used or new that can compete
at that price point the only options in
my mind involved SLI and crossfire this
is where the rx5 80s came at now not
pating on our x5 IDs individually
they're great cards but you shouldn't go
into this thinking that you can throw to
our x5 80s into a rig you know pair them
with a motherboard that sports crossfire
and somehow expect to receive double the
frame rate that's just not how it works
doesn't work that way with NVIDIA and
SLI and AMD is no better in this regard
so i'd around a hundred bucks each again
these cards are absolute steals I should
however note that brand new rx 570s can
be had for around 150 bucks on newegg
again it just depends on how risky you
want to be but to date I've yet to see a
card I bought on eBay kick the can gonna
knock on wood there
these are excavators in particular our
four gig variants which you'll find it's
plenty for most 1080p in 1440p games at
a certain point these cards themselves
can't really keep up with the bumps and
textures tessellation and anti-aliasing
all of which eat up the RAM and in my
testing it takes a heck of a lot to max
four gigs in 1080p you'll also see
shortly why adding a second card to the
equation really changes nothing with
respect to my opinion on this matter but
again we gotta wait a little for that so
push the worst case scenario I bumped
the resolution of 1440 P and in my
testing I ran these cards with crossfire
both enabled and disabled COC 3 charts
here the latter of which though will
effectively remove one card from the
equation so we'll have a GTX 1080 while
have a single rx 580 I know that
comparison and I myself is a little
unfair but we want to see under the
best-case scenario how close a crossfire
580 config can get to a stock GTX 1084
about 300 bucks so $200 all in 4 to 5
ATS versus a single $300 card I had in
my mind the idea that these cards were
gonna somehow compete with $300 core now
it's gonna conclude this video by saying
yeah by 2 RX 5 80s because they're
cheaper and yeah low consume more power
but you'll get more performance and
that's really what most people care
about at the end of the day but yeah
that wasn't the case and I'll admit it
had been a while since I had run
anything in crossfire so there was a bit
of a learning curve I was also surprised
by just how many games lacked crossfire
support in the first place especially
considering the value proposition from
the red team I that you would think AMD
would be pushing the developers to roll
out games with crossfire support native
crossfire support but I just in my Steam
library all the games we typically test
here on the channel very few of them
performed even somewhat decent with both
cards active so the first game I tested
was pub G where the GTX 1080 obviously
fared admirably granted this is an
Nvidia optimized title I expected the
game to pull resources from the 580 and
slightly faster rate than it was so a
little supported there again though not
really AMD's fault
and this really shouldn't be too
surprising the margin here the two cards
are
different categories different price
categories and thus have different
target markets but what shocked me to a
greater extent was how horrible this
game ran with crossfire enabled we
dropped from a low to mid-60s PS
framerate down to a mere 42 or so after
enabling it making the game unplayable
in its current state very choppy we had
a lot of frame skips and yeah just a
horse state overall and I mean come on
pub G's one of those games you want
running it as high a frame rate as
possible and you know the mid 40s was
just not gonna cut it especially when
you're getting by with about 60 to 5 to
70 or so with a single card so for this
game disable crossfire that doesn't make
any sense but do it because you're gonna
get a better result which means
technically speaking this was $100
completely wasted in this case so either
send the $200 into a used gtx 1070 or by
a single RX 580 and pocket the
difference let's move on to a different
game shall we
how about shadow of the Tomb Raider in
this instance we noticed a considerable
jump in framerate using the dx12 API and
now I'm well aware this is also
technically an Nvidia title given the
fact that it was showcased and promoted
by Nvidia during one of their key nodes
but this game actually favors to an
extend AMD even the dx11 API so that's
something to note my Vegas 64
outperforms my GTX 280s in both the X 11
and 12 but that's a different story for
a different video on average though the
single rx 580 pulled roughly 62 FPS and
the ultra preset in 1440p and then
adding a second card bumped us to about
80 which is about a 30% improvement or
1% lowest frame rates drawn revealed a
similar story by the way now moving on
to fortnight similar story to pub G
unfortunately the Unreal Engine doesn't
support crossfire SLI natively under
really any circumstance so we're stuck
with this nearly identical frame rate
with and without the second card
activated but hey I mean at least it's
not as large deficit as pub G's you
don't have to manually disable crossfire
when you want to play fortnight whereas
with pubs you definitely want to do that
because the framerate asperity there was
just abysmal with that second card
active I don't normally test fortnight
since it tends to run fairly smooth on
even cheaper hardware
the potential customers with SLI or
crossfire in mind it should instead
forego these features all together and
stick to a single card next up is GTA 5
and I always test this one because it
handles both Nvidia and AMD Hardware
fairly well by comparison this time with
very high settings in 1440p the
crossfire rx 580 pair edges out a slight
improvement over the single car config
really not what I had hoped for but it's
at least something I should also know
that SLI scales significantly better in
this title so at this point the prospect
of crossfire really isn't looking too
bright GTA 5 was where I really hoped
this would kind of pull ahead all the
games we tested this far either had you
know no bump in performance or just a
tiny bit with the setting enabled with
crossfire enabled so you're better off
sticking with a single card in my
opinion I think it's pretty obvious in
fact I had to hunt specifically for
crossfire optimized titles an attempt to
shift the narrative ever so slightly
toward neutral ground so games like dirt
rally which is AMD optimized dying light
which is technically Nvidia optimized
and the metro 2033 and overwatch tend to
exhibit excellent scaling by these after
mentioned standards but this is cherry
picking I mean if I wanted to point out
games that run crossfire very well I
mean we could completely change the
narrative of this video but I'm just
going by what we typically benchmark on
this channel and I can tell you straight
up that of all the games I have in my
Steam library well most of which I don't
even benchmark with of all those games
about six of them utilize the second
graphics card on average maybe twenty to
thirty percent of the time nothing
really used it more than that that
second card and in most games were
either having that second second card
Pegasus Eero percent or between zero and
ten percent I was using Whatman by the
way AMD's own proprietary software to
check those things you tend to have
conflicts when you install MSI
Afterburner with AMD cards with the new
drivers it's kind of a convoluted thing
but yeah just sticking with AMD for all
of these measurements by the way SLI
it's the same story with respect to my
Steam library so this isn't me hating on
AMD again I just happen to be using
AMD cards for crossfire versus you know
GTX or r-tx cards for SLI or
be linked whatever you want to call that
so it's just it just happens to be AMD
that is the subject of this video but
the story really extends to both
technologies because neither of them
scales very well and this isn't really
the fault per se of the manufacturer of
the cards the developers of the cards
but more or less the developers of the
video games designed to utilize the
hardware at their disposal the the API
soon extent are also to blame but the
engines ultimately are going to control
how effective crossfire and SLI are and
most of them just don't do a great job
because devs don't expect most people to
have two or three or four graphics cards
in their systems in fact I I haven't
looked this up recently but I do recall
on a steam surveyed a number of people
using more than one graphics card or
more than one GPU to be more specific
was under 3% if I'm wrong I'll put
something down here but I'm pretty sure
it was around 3 or under 3% which is a
very small fraction of the gaming
community and that makes sense and you
can't really blame devs either even
though it is technically their fault for
not including optimization with the
engines they're using they just they
don't need to because most of the hair
consumers aren't running more than one
card so why would they go through the
hassle of adding something that might
cripple single card users if most of
their users are in fact using just one
card so like the reason why this video
exists is somebody could go out today
and buy two rx5 80s or four eighties or
whatever pop them into a rig and assume
the best ignorance is bliss right but
the truth of the matter is that nothing
from what I've seen this experiment
points toward promoting SLI or crossfire
unless you're applying a very specific
set of games and you've done a heck of a
lot of research it's just not worth it
now if you've been around a while this
should really be no surprise right I'd
never recommend buying two of the same
graphics card unless it was for very
specific say productivity work or if you
just had cash begging to be spent that's
the real truth of it and I'll admit I
wasn't this hard up about the whole
ordeal until now until realizing just
how piss-poor pub G handled the
crossfire config and for - just how
other games either neglected to
acknowledge the second GPU altogether or
failed to utilize it passed maybe 10 or
20
percent which is I mean that's 20% of an
rx5 80s like a GT 730 like do you really
want to spend a hundred bucks on a GT
730 that's how I see it
and it just isn't worth the money and
that brings us to the ultimate take away
don't go into this thinking the
crossfire SLI is truly worth it
for the average gamer especially in a
budget build right where money is tight
we're trying to just get the most out of
every dollar spent I mean that money
could be spent better on a 500 gig SSD
like a Samsung 860 Evo or a killer case
an RGB lighting kit if you're an
aesthetic person like me or a better CPU
or an extra 8 gigs of ram assuming
you're only on 8 to begin with or how
about this spending the saved money on a
better graphics card to begin with how
about instead of buying to rx 5 ATS you
buy a single gtx 1070 or maybe a gtx
980ti i've discussed and benchmark both
in previous videos like this one right
here and while they don't always
outperform a dual rx 5 ad setup again
very few cases in which that happens I
can almost guarantee you that they're
gonna outperform most to her ex 5 ad
setups that's just how it is because
again most games don't like crossfire
and SLI that is the blatant truth of it
they're just better buys in my book the
92 TI in the 1070 this is an AMD small
per se and I want you to you know
include us-ally in the conversation by
default since the story really doesn't
change much for that case either but
we've got to work with what's at our
disposal and by the way if you're just
wanting like a more affordable setup in
general an rx 580 as a standalone card
is one heck of a deal for a hundred
bucks you know used or new in my opinion
and like I said earlier all four of
these are x5 ''tis you're saying here
we're used for mining all four of them
work all for sellers disclose the fact
that they were mining cards and I've had
no issues so far I will say that I want
to close though with this I don't want
you to take anything negative regarding
the rx 580 from this video they're
excellent cards for the money and better
buys in my opinion over say a gtx 1060
assuming you don't have a preference for
nvidia titles or software but buying
these two cards or any card for that
matter for the purpose of I don't know
boosting your frame rates of your entire
Steam library by even 50
percent which in my opinion is still
pretty conservative that is a huge
stretch and a huge overstep in my book
what do you think by the way I still
have the two rx5 eighties in this this
right here I'm taking them out
immediately I'm gonna put the cheetah X
1080 back in the system not because you
know I just want better frame rates
overall because it's just generally
unstable trying to game with two rx5 ATS
most of the games I play pub G
especially it's it's annoying having to
go through you know crimson drivers AMD
drivers whatever they're called now
we're using the adrenalin drivers I
think at this point I don't like going
through and manually disabling crossfire
to play a game I shouldn't have to do
that and I'm not gonna do that because
I'm gonna take them out I'll run a
single rx 580 and a more affordable rig
in the future but for now a single
graphics card is gonna cut it for me
something just a little more expensive
in the use market will go a long way
what do you guys think again comment
section below I will be checking that
out I also again want to thank privacy
dot-com for sponsoring this video give
this one a thumbs up you thought it was
cool thumbs down for the opposite click
that red sticker I'm choking myself I've
been really sick today yeah it's been
like it's really a tough day yesterday
my throat was just so swollen I couldn't
even talk so yesterday filming I wasn't
gonna happen but yeah it's been really
tough to even film this video so I
apologize I sound a little nasally if I
sound like I'm choking if I feel like
I'm joking but anyway I appreciate you
bearing with me click that red subscribe
button if you're feeling special feel
lucky and I'll catch you in the next
video this is science studio thanks for
