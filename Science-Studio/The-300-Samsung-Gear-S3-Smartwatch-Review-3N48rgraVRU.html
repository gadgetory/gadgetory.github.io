spontaneous and rather unjustified
purchases but this is not one of them
meet the Samsung gear s three classic a
water and dust proof 1.3 inch Smart
Watch my original plan was to go with a
frontier model which looks a bit more
like a diving watch but this one caught
my eye in person and it all comes down
to preference and chances are you're
watching this video you're curious as to
whether or not a Smart Watch purchase is
a sound and justified one coming from a
sport watch from the Apple experiment
series I felt like something was missing
when I sold it so I went after the
biggest and best available Samsung's
done at this time so let's run through
the specs first the 46 millimeter faced
Super AMOLED 360 by 360 pixels equated
to a 278 pixel per inch density
dual-core 1 gigahertz processor 768
megabytes of RAM with 4 gigs of internal
storage built in djaro accelerometer
heart rate and barometer sensors and a
380 million power battery will discuss
battery life here shortly the most
prominent feature of the watch is the
screen of course and it's vibrant and
beautiful I run it at full brightness
24/7 but even half brightness will do
even in direct sunlight which is
typically LEDs downfall and 278 PPI is
more than enough for a watch's viewing
distance you'd be hard-pressed to see
pixels from a foot away Corning Gorilla
Glass keeps the screen strong and the
rotating bezel surrounding the frame is
smooth and precise it actually gets
addicting just doing this right here
speed was a major concern of mine even
lightweight watch OS struggled to keep
things under control on Apple side but
Samsung's done a great job packing more
than capable Hardware the one gigahertz
a dual core is steady and strong I
haven't encountered a single crash or
stall although a few glitches are here
and there something the gear s2 could
not maintain that steady vibe the jump
in ram also gives the s3 an edge
switching between apps and pages is near
seamless regardless of whether you
choose to use the rotating bezel or just
a single swipe one complaint I do have
though involves the band included with
the s3 classic of which the frontier
does not have to work that band is more
of a rubber durable band this is quote
genuine leather which in and of itself
is an ambiguous term it also tends to
crease easily just keep it in mind if
you opt for the classic variant the
frontiers band is much more agile and
resistance designed more
or the outdoorsy kind of person and
speaking of the year s3 watches are both
water and dust proof as mentioned
earlier
so when advised swimming in an ocean
with them or even showering with them
it's just nice to have that extra peace
of mind in the event that you find
yourself in the middle of a torrential
downpour with no umbrella there's a
single microphone on the gear s3s right
side along with the speaker dead center
left both are very good I tried a few
test calls with my brothers and they
couldn't tell the difference between
phone and watch audio clarity this is
great news especially for those looking
for hands-free calling
however awkward that may look just wear
a suit and tie and doing this all the
time like you seem like a Secret Service
agent to dive a bit further into the OS
here for those who are new to the
wearable tech scene you'll find it's a
lot like operating an Android smartphone
tilting the watch toward your face will
activate the screen swiping less and
right will bring up various customizable
pages and swiping down will prompt to
the Settings window if you're at all
familiar with the Android operating
system then there won't be much of a
learning curve here
there are also Bluetooth and LTE capable
versions of the gear s3 a separate
dedicated SIM card is provided by your
carrier for the LTE models but I find
the Bluetooth model to be satisfactory
most people aren't going to leave their
phones behind anyway be honest with
yourself how many times a day have you
gone without having your phone either in
your pocket or somewhere you can easily
access it so I think saving the extra
hundred or so bucks and the contract to
go with just the Bluetooth model of the
watch is just fine
one of my favorite software features the
several hundred watch faces to choose
from not only are dozens built into the
watch but the Samsung gear store offers
plenty of third-party content despites
things up a bit
check out this predator theme or how
about this blingy Roman numeral backdrop
chances are whatever you're looking for
this store will have and it's growing
everyday
now I'd like to end on battery life for
comparison the gear s2 watches packs a
250 million power battery that's last
generations watches still a decent size
but of which prompted many complaints
from customers they're plagued in Amazon
and Newegg reviews if you can't make it
through a single full day's use the
batteries too small plain and simple but
in the case of the gear s3 classic and
frontier you're looking at a 380 million
power lithium ion battery in the real
world my world at least that equates to
nearly three full days
of use that is so beautiful needless to
say you could easily make it through
even two days I would say a full screen
brightness and LTE blazing in the
background
assuming you forget to charge it once or
twice and that's the point
watches shouldn't have to be charged
every single night like a smartphone and
the gear s3 does a great job in this
regard the frames a bit thicker as a
result the watch as a whole is quite
large compared to my wrist but it's a
trade-off I'm more than happy to make if
you ask me 300 u.s. dollars is a sweet
price point as for the Samsung gear s 3
for worthy buy and that's coming from
someone who paid for one out of his own
pocket you can find links to both the
classic and frontier variants of the s3
