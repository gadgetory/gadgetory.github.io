are in the office because we got a
couple things to set up we've still kind
of been in like the the construction
phase here the desks are not entirely
finished we do have raw MDF just kind of
like on the surface here which is why I
have one of these mats at least for my
side now the computers on the opposite
side of the room have admittedly been
for show for the past month or two and
we are going to be basically putting
these into full use very soon maybe not
that one over there it's pretty cheap I
have another one I'm gonna set up
instead for that side of the desk but we
are going to be using both and one way
we're gonna be using both is thanks to
Coolermaster peripherals so you can see
that this computer over here really has
nothing except for her
Zoe Mouse and this computer has well
it's the Bluetooth Microsoft Mouse yet
it's not good at all and then we have a
g.skill brown switch keyboards keyboards
actually really good but I'm gonna move
this somewhere else
I want all Coolermaster stuff in here I
hit them up I said hey I need help
because these computers are naked they
said we got you so I've got my I 373 50k
box-cutter CPU here and get through this
it's gonna shred some tape I wonder if
this thing still works I should throw a
PC and see if it still work I've opened
so many boxes with it alright
okay first thing I see here this is
master pulse MH 320 now these admittedly
are not like top-of-the-line headsets
they're more like budget oriented but
that's kind of what I wanted and want to
go all up top because frankly a lot of
people can't afford peripherals like
that and and that's not something that I
want to just like to show off in here
because I'm not paying for them they're
sending them so it's really nice that
they sent more budget oriented
peripherals like that we have master
keys Pro now these immediately aren't
very budget friendly but keyboards I
would say are probably the most
important thing at least for a content
creation and some would say even gaming
what about you do you think that the
keyboard of the mouse is more important
when you play first-person shooters I
guess I could see that another image 320
headsets so both of these pcs will be
using the image day 20 by the way you
can find the links to all of these
products in the video description I
won't post multiple links for the same
things we have three headsets we're not
going to see the riehen set links but we
do have to read those which is really
cool we also have looks like another two
master keys pro now one of these is
brown yep one of these is red and one
more Brown one okay let's find Browns a
nice nice middle ground here so we've
got three of the master keys pros and
then for mice we have three of the mm5
30s these are also relatively
budget-friendly these aren't going to
break the bank by any means I think
around 3040 bucks or so and these will
get the job done
now these yeah pretty much all the same
well they sent the same of everything
that's interesting so we have exactly
the same setups for three different pcs
here but that's okay because it's gonna
look uniform and that's kind of the
point so the next thing we need to do
apart from setting up the peripherals
will test them out let you know what I
think about them especially with the
price in mind is pick some sort of
desktop and get it desktop for these
desks that we've built we're like I said
using just raw MDF right now and that's
not good because if you spill anything
on MDF it will swell off and weaken and
it'll just end up
breaking overtime so we need to pick
some sort of like coding for this to
make you know gaming and and all that
stuff all the use of this desk viable so
we will be basically running a poll I
guess we're gonna do a poll on YouTube
we'll probably do one on Twitter as well
now that we can do a poll on YouTube it
should be interesting to see how many
people participate in that so stay tuned
and we'll decide on what we're gonna use
for our desk is based on what you tell
us we'll give you like four or five
choices and we'll go from there so let's
go and set these up and I'll give you
just a quick review of each of the
products and let you know what I think
about each for the price mmm these boxes
are admittedly pretty heavy so you know
build quality is top-notch here are
these are these Wireless oh they're just
modular are they are they modular I
don't even know like what
tell us worst no way I don't know it it
okay yes so the cables modular so it
plugs in there underneath and then you
just funnel it through the the base of
the frame into your computer and you
also get a nice braided cable so things
are gonna look nice and classy on your
desk so we'll sit both of them up you
also get a key switch remover really
when I get fancy with it never seen one
of these before but pretty easy to use
so these are legit Cherry MX brown
switches you're gonna close up on that
babe mmm-hmm oh yeah look at that look
at that Pro focus she's manually
focusing this camera by the way so I'm
pretty proud of her I love the feeling
of browns
oh so good and I pull out reds and you
do it yeah it's like no tactile feedback
with Reds I don't see how you do it
alright your mousepad Jesus woman it's
just - your mousepad is just too big
it's too big to be just a mousepad but
it's too small to be a mousepad plus
keyboard but then you're gonna like I'm
a gamer so just kind of playing around
with it it's actually really intuitive
the software is all kind of built into
the keyboard I don't think that there's
any dedicated software on the PC that
you'll need to use and if there is it's
it's pretty unnecessary because
it's very simple function you got mode
on F for effect if you just hold
function down you can see the keyboard
like indicates to you what you have
available in terms of like your options
so you can change the keys to red green
some late whoops okay maybe I need the
manual does mesmerising alright time for
fitting session so they feel really good
and they're very tight but they're not
like uncomfortably tight so these things
aren't going anywhere really microphone
is flexible pretty much throw this
wherever you want it will do a mic check
in a second now there is no fancy RGB or
anything in this it's it's like I said
it's a budget oriented option but I'm
gonna be interested to see how it sounds
both in terms of my quality and audio
quality now for the fit which is what
we're focusing on here of course their
headset that I have which is a
competitor but it's a it's a higher
priced competitor has integrated RGB
lighting and it's really flexible and
whatnot just doesn't fit this thing do
you see how much it's wobbling like it
just it'll literally fall off my head
and it's been like that since day one
I'm not sure if this is like this
particularly units issue or if it's like
this overall I've just kind of put up
with it because I'm not really like
swinging my head too much but if someone
calls me and I'm like soft and I got a
refit it you know it's just it's not
ideal so in terms of comfort I would
actually choose this over the Corsair
competitor it just it just fits with
these and it's it's kind of like a one
size fits all thing because it's
spring-loaded and you have these like
flexible elastic straps up top that keep
things nice and centered what's a cool
hip saw I can check all right we're
gonna test out now the audio quality of
this headset of course when you got
cables it's really hard to go from a
wireless headset to a wired one
steve-o's puppy sounds like okay I'm
intrigued okay let's get to the music
this isn't bumpin all right time to test
what it sounds like in game I assume
it's gonna sound as good as I did when I
played the song and we're also gonna
test microphone clarity so I'll pop up
like a voice recorder just talk while
I'm in game and we'll also see how I
sound out there people how'd it all
sounds good sounds really good
I could hear footsteps that's a good
thing last thing I'm gonna do let's pull
up the camera one two one two
Oh am i muted no who's that thing up do
microphone do some 20 dB alright so
we're gonna start recording so we're
testing the audio clarity quality right
now of the master headset that I have on
and now apart from the audio the audio
sounded great this is the only other
thing I'm worried about what a lot of
companies had to do is compromise on the
mic quality for the sake of keeping like
decent speakers in the system so let's
see how much of a compromise
Coolermaster made on the microphone okay
good let's play it back now okay so I'm
gonna be completely honest like they
just sent this stuff out right so still
you know sponsored video source but uh
the microphone makes me sound like my
analysis clogged
basically it's just super trebly oh gosh
I wonder what it would sound like if I
did it like this and recorded it with
the microphone it would be like a double
nasal like destruction but okay like
honestly not disappointed I mean like
when you spent 50 bucks in a headset
you're gonna have some compromises and
that's not what you know this isn't
intended to please the audio files out
there this isn't supposed to be a studio
quality headset by any means but it does
sound pretty baller at least on the
audio side microphone side hey it's not
trash you're not gonna hear any weird
buzzing or anything like that in the
background it will get the job done it
won't be the clearest sounding
microphone over 50 bucks I really can't
complain okay so as a wrap-up here
considering these products are not like
the highest end products at coolermaster
offers a apart from the keyboards which
are really great look I'm not the
biggest fan of Reds but those Reds do
feel pretty darn good I'm fairly sad
what we have in here I don't want the
best of the best it's just it's not
something I want to just rub into
people's faces for no reason I want to
have hardware that most people use
because that's what you all can relate
to at least most of you and and I'm
happy with the mouse I like the DPI
settings on here
I like the RGB integration I like the
keyboard a lot of courses this is a
high-end keyboard I would say with
cherry MX genuine Cherry MX switches oh
wow the DPI is like super high right now
there we go and the headsets are like I
said good in terms of audio quality and
okay to subpar in terms of my quality
but again keep the prices into
consideration can find all three of
these products link in the video
description I encourage you to check
them out if you are a baller on a budget
by the way one big change we're gonna
make to the layout of the office I'm
actually gonna move that desk into the
film room so we'll have our editing
workstation in the film room and this
will be more or less a dedicated like
gaming room you could still edit in here
and do whatever else you wanted but this
will be more or less a gaming room and
we'll have still a bunch of our hardware
in the closet kind of just sitting in
here and we'll put some cupboards up and
have it like I don't know I don't know
exactly what this will be like a
multi-purpose room but I'm not really
into the idea of having two desks in
here anymore just because I'm starting
to see the space that close in and
that's something that Lisa told me about
beforehand I didn't really see it play
out until I put the desks in here so
this is sound damping foam it prevents
the sounds from echoing off of walls and
then returning to your microphone giving
in that River of effect or any sort of
echo that you might hear in your audio
so if you're interested in damping your
sound it's not dampening it's damp being
your sound then you can check out Aero
zoom in the video description we have
actually a 10% off discount code if you
type in AZ science at checkout you get
10% off your whole purchase this foam
isn't cheap it's not really expensive
either but putting that discount code in
there can really save you some bucks so
check them out I preached you guys
watching the video and hopefully the
next time you see us do like a vlog like
this the office will be officially set
ready to go ready to game with that if
you liked it be sure to give a thumbs up
thumbs down for the obstacle you
subscribe and after and in stay tuned
