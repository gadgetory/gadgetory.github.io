is not the AMD sub $100 PC build that
I've been teasing about in past videos
instead what I have in this video is a
PC that cost around $150 in total all
parts included except for a sound card
which you could probably just find lying
around somewhere although you could pick
one up for about five or ten bucks
depending on where you look what makes
this PC special or rather not special at
all as the fact that it's running on a
Pentium D 830 which is a subpar CPU by
today's standards it features only two
cores and two threads and two megabytes
of l2 cache if that alone doesn't seem
like a big deal check out our Cinebench
score yeah to be completely honest I had
much bigger plans for this PC much
bigger than a pentium d I purchased this
q 6600 off of ebay for just over 16
bucks
bragged about it quite a bit on Twitter
if you're not follow me on Twitter do so
at sc/st Salazar and then I ultimately
ended up looking like a complete idiot
because I did not know up front that the
q 6600 was not just by default
compatible with every LGA 775
motherboard out there what a letdown I
presume that because the CPU would fit
in the sockets that the computer which
is boot up no problems learn from my
mistake folks if you're building an old
PC make sure that the CPU you are using
is 100% compatible with the motherboard
it doesn't require a BIOS update or
anything like that because if you need a
BIOS update on that motherboard but you
don't have a CPU that's compatible with
a motherboard before the BIOS update
you're kind of out of luck because
you're not gonna be able to update the
BIOS without a CPU in there
a few exceptions might be possible some
of the older workarounds still work but
for the most part just know your stuff I
didn't know my stuff so I'm stuck with a
Q 6600 and no motherboard for it to work
with I ended up finding a Pentium D 830
and Dell motherboard combo on eBay for
about 40 bucks and you can find one
similar to that price this guy right
here is asking for 50 bucks you can
probably talk them down to at least 40 I
doubt that combo is in high demand
anymore the motherboard is designed for
specific Dell XPS towers and I found one
on eBay for about 20 bucks the one
you're looking at here is not the one I
purchased but it was similar to it it
had a bunch of dead parts in it CPU was
not in there nor were any hard drives
that was no big deal for $20
take it I purchased the Seagate 500
gigabyte 7200 rpm hard drive for $20
just over that actually and a power
supply that was compatible with the
tower for also around 20 bucks not bad
so $40 for storage and power
I had the tower I had the motherboard
the CPU the RAM and the last thing I was
debating on purchasing was a graphics
card now for this kind of computer if
you saw my seven dollar CPU video if you
haven't you can check it out right here
you know that that CPU pretty much
bottleneck to anything that I threw at
it any game and I was using a gtx 960
which I felt was pretty much the maximum
you want to spend any more than that
because there's no point you're not
gonna get any added performance out of
it because the CPU is such a bottleneck
so as a result what I decided to do was
throw into the good old g2 10 the
graphics card that has a total of 16
cuda cores in it you can check that out
in more detail in the card above me if
you haven't already but yeah I think it
was a perfect fit and I'll show you why
right now
minecraft is a very finicky game it's a
very CPU intensive game which is very
odd for a game of this caliber and
ultimately we ended up getting around 20
to 30 FPS on the average in this game
now it was very stuttery if I was doing
anything in the background including
downloading a game from steam while
playing Minecraft it was it was
completely unplayable I do not recommend
doing anything else while playing games
on this PC in an effort to remedy the
situation I decided to give the computer
the benefit of the doubt I closed scene
made sure that no other background
processes were utilizing the CPU in any
significant way and then turned down a
bunch of settings in Minecraft including
everything that was set to fancy down to
fast and then also reduced the rendering
chunks from 12 to 6 the results was
actually impressive
the game was now seeing around 40 to 50
FPS a significant improvement from what
we were seeing in the earlier scenario
so yes obviously under certain
conditions this computer will handle
minecraft you will experience some
artefacts the games background will not
be loading as swiftly as you might like
it to in fact in some instances and
created when I was moving super fast
through the air I ended up being in a
space that wasn't rendered yet and it
looked very strange I could actually see
down into the ground for a while before
the land was actually rendered around me
so you'll experience things like that in
a computer this slow and with only three
gigs of RAM but for the most part if
that is what you want to do and that's
what you're willing to experience yes
you can play Minecraft in this PC no
problem but before I get grilled in the
comments for only showcasing one game in
this video I mean the title of this
video is kind of play Minecraft I
understand that I'm gonna deviate a
little bit from that original question
by showcasing a different game a game
that I don't believe is very taxing by
today's standards but I think could be a
challenge for this PC in its own right
that game is left for dead now before I
show you the results pick a FPS range in
your head that you expect this computer
to experience with this game I'm curious
to see if you overestimate or
underestimate or just get right on the
money what this computer experiences
with the game so without further ado
here it goes
impressive to say the least I expected
this computer to yield around 15 to 20
fps but we were experiencing well over
30 for much of the game even when I was
surrounded by dozens of zombies tanks
somewhere out there and fire that was
expanding all over the place my gaming
experience was not affected in any
significant way in fact even when it
dipped below 30 fps it still looked
rather smooth much smoother than
Minecraft did around the same framerate
so perhaps a little fishy in this case
but I think a lot of it has to do with
the fact that this game is not a CPU
intensive as minecraft is now a lot of
you are probably thinking Greg why are
you showing us something so obvious a
$150 computer will struggle to play
almost any game even at this resolution
but that's not the point here the point
is sheer curiosity I want to know how
cheap I can go on my computer parts
before my gameplay experience is
diminished to a point where I don't feel
like playing the game on it anymore so
considering the fact that this
motherboard CPU combo was about 40 bucks
I would say about five dollars for the
CPU and maybe 30 to 35 for the
motherboard I'm actually impressed with
what we saw in this video
heck even the g2 10 was pulling its own
weight a lot of you were saying that
that car was not designed for gameplay I
strongly disagree you can play plenty of
games with this card even though it's
only about $20 currently now this would
be the point in the video when I would
say something like do I recommend this
or should you build this I'm not gonna
answer that question because I want you
to in the comments below now don't take
this out on me this is just something
that I do just for fun okay I'm not
trying to build the best budget PC so
don't get that confused with this sheer
curiosity they have for these parts
obviously akyuu 6600 is going to perform
much better than pentium d unfortunately
given the circumstances and my just lack
of knowledge at the time I couldn't use
this processor to benchmark with
nonetheless this Pentium D did not let
me down like I thought it would this
computer which if you would currently
for around 150 US dollars if you find
the right seller at the right time will
play many games on Steam in lower
resolutions including minecraft
left4dead League of Legends and dota 2
and is also perfect for anybody who just
types out documents on Microsoft Word or
edits powerpoints or does some
accounting and Excel for example
not too shabby XPS 409 if you like what
you saw in this video give it a thumbs
up give it a thumbs down
if you feel the complete opposite or if
you hate everything about life be sure
to click the subscribe but if you
haven't already stay tuned for that AMD
build that I have been teasing about for
quite a while don't worry I'm not gonna
make you wait much longer also stay
tuned for the benchmarks of this build
behind me which you can check out in
more detail in the card above me this is
