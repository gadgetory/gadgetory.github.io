ultra-wide go it was actually a
Christmas present for my parents a few
years ago blue sky was demanding
something a bit more extravagant not
just 1080p at 75 Hertz so I gave the
ultra wide to my brother and purchased
one of these an asus rog swift PG 278 q
are at around six hundred US dollars or
so it's not on the cheap side but as
you'll see shortly nothing about this
spec sheet is cheap either first and
foremost this is a 1440p display
spanning approximately 27 diagonal
inches yielding a pixel per inch density
of around 109 you won't see much in the
way of pixels past around two feet of
clearance making it a sweet spot for
both gamers and content creators with
this two gtx 1080s blue sky could have
handled a 4k display and no problem but
I'd much rather trade in the additional
PPI for a superior refresh rate that's
exactly what the 270 AQR brings to the
table 165 Hertz insane to say the least
now they do have 240 hertz monitors on
the market but most are 1080p on account
of the pixel refresh demand at higher
resolutions so it all comes down to
preference this is the sweet spot for me
now back to build quality my first
impressions right out of the box we're
literally all positive and I'm not just
saying that because I bought this with
my own money the monitor ships
preassembled which is nice and sports an
extremely organ on expand but if that
doesn't suit your fancy the chassis also
supports evasive mounting systems if you
do choose to keep the stand you'll find
a red halo ring at the base courtesy of
the ROG color scheme 120 millimeter
height adjustment mechanism extremely
smooth by the way 180 degree pivot 60Â°
swivel left and right and 20 degree
tilts up 5 degrees down you'll also find
a cable management guru for routing
various cables a nice touch
perhaps the only downside here on behalf
of its versatility the stand is quite
large meaning that you won't be able to
position your monitor as far back as you
might want it isn't insanely heavy
though which seems to conflict with its
build quality which I find to be
excellent usually those go hand-in-hand
but in this case it's not a very heavy
monitor so things balance out in my book
connectivity options range from HDMI 1.4
no 2.0 here and DisplayPort 1.2 you'll
need to use DP if you want anything
about 60 Hertz is 1440p by the way along
with two USB 3.0 ports headphone jack is
also onboard
no DVI though it wouldn't make much
sense on this
anyway 278 QR is also rocking a 1
millisecond response time which implies
lightning-fast color changes for each
pixel common measurements and display
response time vary from gray to gray and
black to white etc where pixels must
shift from one color to another there
there are different ways that they do
this there is technically no industry
standard but I do have a video
explaining the difference between input
lag and response time those are often
confused you can check it out in the
card right here needless to say you will
not see any bit of ghosting I'm not
going to put my mark on that but I
haven't seen any ghosting so far on this
monitor navigation is on point as well
you'll find a single joystick at the
back followed by a few dedicated hotkeys
for integrated software then to improve
your visual experience I don't use them
but I do thoroughly enjoy navigating the
menus asus has made it very simple and
the script up front is subdued against
the monitors thin bezel nothing
ostentatious and just you know
disruptive so now let's talk about the
display itself how good does this thing
look in person well there are few things
we should get out of the way first my
first thought was wow this is
overexposed brightness levels will
require a bit of tweaking out of the box
as well contrast and white balance this
however is typical of most monitors what
I do like to do since I don't have any
fancy hardware is hold a white piece of
paper next to a blank white page on
screen and adjust RGB values accordingly
for brightness and contrast calibration
pull up a window with very fine text can
tune to the point where writing is
explicit and legible this can all be
done within the on-board menu just use
the joystick around back to navigate
black levels are decent we're looking at
a thousand to 1 contrast ratio typical
of most LCDs a downside here though this
is a TN panel
you can purchase the IPS equivalent
which cost you an additional 150 US
dollars as of right now but like I
always say it just comes down to
preference you could spend a bit more
for an IPS display which really won't
look much different when you're sitting
in front of it I've compared several IPS
and TN panels I can only really tell
which is which when I'm sitting at the
thing from anything more than about a
30-degree angle from head-on though as
long as the screen isn't too wide colour
reproduction is fairly consistent
between both TN and IPS displays at
least nowadays by the way this is coming
from someone who literally just switched
from IPS to TN about two days ago it's
not as big a deal as you might think
for FPS and racing gamers especially
this one will do just fine
while many will swear by IPS technology
TN panels can also offer a decent color
reproduction if calibrated correctly so
it will admittedly require a bit of
patience most TN panels nowadays are
pretty good just don't sit SuperDuper
close to the screen or colors we'll be
all out of whack I should emphasize
though this by no means is a negative
for a suit
they still do offer an IPS counterpart
the next thing I want to briefly discuss
before and this review is a g-sync
I have never seen it in person before
ever not until now the purpose of Nvidia
g-sync much like freesync
is to synchronize screen refresh rates
with frames being sent from onboard
graphics vsync we'll do this natively to
eliminate tearing but may induce
stuttering g-sync takes things a step
further but in the expense of Weltman
added expense personally I don't see a
difference when I game even in high
refresh rate first-person shooters and
that's for what these monitors were
intended so in a nutshell this is an
excellent monitor despite hefty price
tag although if you're not into the
whole g-sync and 165 Hertz refresh
marketing ploys you can buy the 144
Hertz counterpart for significantly less
but this is still one you should
consider my big three or Asus LG and
Acer and you can find what you're
looking for from one of these three
companies you'll be good to go and if
you've got the computer horsepower to
back up the high refresh rate and
resolution the PG 278 QR it's a long
name is a swift buy get it because it's
the rog swift come on if you liked the
review give this one a thumbs up thumbs
down for the opposite or to just hate
