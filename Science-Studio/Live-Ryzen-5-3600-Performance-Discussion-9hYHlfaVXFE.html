now I am going to turn down see do I
have desktop audio coming through yet
let's turn that down and audio is
looking nice and crispy drop that down
no there goes okay so yeah sorry I'm
trimming with the webcam look it's
nothing fancy okay I used to have the
yes I want a DSLR I used to have the a7
s a7 s here with a 7-3 up here and it
made me look all nice and crispy for the
live streams but honestly a lot of what
I'm gonna be doing in this video is on
the PC and I'd rather not have a big
camera just staring me in the face
someone says something about it add is
that how YouTube does it now I have no
idea how they monetize live streams I've
never I really don't even go back and
watch my own live streams like whatever
I say I say and so yeah if it's like
showing you an ad that's really funny it
should only be one now hopefully it's
not like a 30-second ad that would
really blow like you're gonna be even
further behind in a live stream so we'll
see we'll see
Renne is asking about how the law stuff
is coming and the lawsuit update is
coming very very soon we are waiting on
the magistrate to rule on the hearing
regarding jurisdiction so for those who
are kind of behind them that I filed a
motion to dismiss on grounds of
jurisdiction that means I do not believe
that the state of Indiana has
jurisdiction over a small business
operating in the state of Florida and my
lawyers have done a great job I think of
putting together that case so we'll see
it really depends on how the judge rules
and we should have good we should know
soon I mean the hearing was like three
weeks ago so it's it's two or three
weeks ago so it is taking a while but I
can't tell you much more than that
because I don't know the outcome if if
you know the judge says that they have
jurisdiction
and that means I will have to defend
myself or have counsel defend me in
court and again this is small claims
we're talking about so there's literally
like six grand on the line it's not like
a huge class-action lawsuit or anything
like that it is small claims and so
we'll see but yeah interesting okay
so for that from that we're gonna move
on to a little eizember v 3600 now you
guys probably wondering why I emphasize
that particular CPU that's because I've
talked about this before I really think
that that CPU just like the 2600 just
like the 1600 before it is going to be
the best value chip of the lot and like
I've said this before six cores is
becoming the new four core right
requirement it's really difficult now to
get away with two cores at all which is
why they've been largely phased out of
consumer grade chips you go for an i3
it's a four core now you go for an i-5
it's a six core now you go for an i7
it's an eight core now right so Intel
has been forced to kind of play the same
game AMD has and that is force higher
core count consumer grade chips to
market and AMD has done a great job
doing that they have radically changed
the game
there's undeniable but I don't want to
focus too much on the whole core count
argument I will say they're very vaguely
that I still think a majority of you
we're going to benefit the most and in
terms of value from the six and eight
court ships anything higher than that
and to me it is just not justified in
the majority of consumers eyes yeah it's
gonna sound really good really good to
have a 16 core or even a 12 core chip in
your system but you have to be able to
justify the uses for that chip you have
to be able to utilize at least eight or
ten of those cores and that's just the
course we're talking 36 what 36 32
threads here at the most on a
consumer-grade chip that's unheard of so
yeah it's going to change the game but
it's going to take a long time for
developers to really push the notion
that a higher core count computer is
worth having and one of the reasons for
that is because if you
develop an application or a software
suite or whatever just a basic program
around a 16 core CPU as the mainstream
chip involved then you're going to leave
behind a majority of people who are
running dual core setups and they are a
majority dual core quad core computers
most people are look on steam surveys
most people are using dual cores
quad-core hexa cores is where you start
to see it drastically taper off and it's
going to take a long time for for those
to become again the norm so I I just I'm
not totally on board yet with the whole
idea that 16 core chips belong at suit
and consumer grade platforms as much as
I love the idea that AMD is pushing this
higher core count race and they're
leading it frankly they're forcing Intel
to keep up I really think that past a
certain point software starts to leave
you behind and developers do that on
purpose because not everyone can afford
a 12 Courtship most people can't
actually so there's something to
consider there also something else I saw
here there's a really good comment in
the chat let's see here yep I grumpy
monk says I have no idea why people are
going for the 3600 X and not the 3600 so
look we don't know yet we have no idea
if the 3600 X is gonna be a massively
good overclock or compared to the 3600
what I can't tell you though is that
based on precedent alone I don't believe
it's going to be that much different so
you'll pay the extact s-- but you
probably won't see huge gains or the
gains that your money is trying to
justify so $1.99 really good deal for 6
cores 12 threads especially with this
increase in IPC that we've been
expecting from 7 animator architecture
but when it comes to paying another 40
or 50 bucks for a slightly higher clock
chip are we going to see those extra
gains added on top of what we can do
with manual over clocks is XMP going to
be able to or exit far excuse me going
to really scale up those frequencies
much higher on the X variants of these
of these CPUs and in my opinion I don't
think that's gonna happen
I really don't
and so we're gonna have to see yeah you
know this stuff's coming out soon you'll
see review soon and I'm looking forward
to running my tests I want to talk to
you guys about how I'm going to be
approaching my benchmarks for these for
these chips particularly how I'm going
to be conducting my Rison 530 800 review
because this is this is something we
talked about earlier in our members
livestream which we just had if you're a
member then you should have been in that
because I would have been awesome if
you're not a member you consider
becoming one
maybe it's like five bucks a month but
you're gonna get a weekly livestream
with me personally there's only like
there like today there was only two
people in it right
two people mr. K F gaming its Smitty
weights I know exactly who they are
because they were the only two in it I
know we have more members than that but
it's just that's the time that I can do
it and a majority of my viewers are US
base so I think this is a decent time
and on the weekend I don't expect you to
make every one but it's something I'm
trying to do to incentivize members and
make them feel like they're getting
something for their money anyway we were
talking in that conversation that just
happened about how we're going to
approach the interviews the 3600 is
going to be by far the most popular chip
I believe and the reason why is because
it's it's literally undercutting I think
everything to date on both AMD's to own
site and Intel side the 8700 K is
obviously the direct competitor to this
CPU alright so you would think logically
that oh well it makes sense then to
compare the risin 530 600 to the 8700 K
because they both have six cores and
twelve threads and they yeah they both
have pretty high out of box frequencies
right that makes sense who wouldn't do
that okay but here is cents in your swag
buns you got my name wrong so I'd prefer
you uh I prefer you didn't anyway so
might might my approach this is going to
be on the basis of price alone and what
I mean by that is I'm going to test and
compare CPUs in the same price
category I might throw the 8700 K in
there but for all intents and purposes
when you agree mentally to spend 200
bucks on a CPU you shouldn't be looking
at $300 or $400 CPUs ie just shouldn't
because you're either going to really
want it and probably compromise on other
aspects of your system to get the better
chip because it's the more expensive
chip right why not or it's just going to
be an affirmation factor for you're
gonna feel better about your $200
purchase because well for 350 I could
get comparable performance in the 8700 K
which is what I expect it'll it'll be
fairly close that's not I'm not my job
is not to make you feel good my job is
to give you the most informed purchase
decision basis it's to give you the
facts and to rule on those facts and
insert my opinions where I think it's
applicable if you don't like my opinions
go watch other tech tubers they we all
have different opinions I really
encourage you guys to watch more than
one or two reviews even if they're from
channels you don't like and that would
give you a well-rounded again opinion
about the product an informed opinion as
a difference between just an opinion and
one that is informed so when you see my
rise in 536 and review I will be
comparing that chip to a comparable
Intel CPU on the basis of price I will
compare a $200 or so CPU to the 3600 I
still will probably throw in 8700 K
benchmarks but my conclusions will be
based on the direct comparison between
the two CPUs that are priced similarly
because if that is the the conscious
decision that you make to spend 200
bucks on a CPU then you should only
really be comparing the two CPUs that
are in your price category and so in
order to kind of clear the waters right
get rid of the mud and the crap that
frankly doesn't matter to people who are
more budget conscious I'm going to focus
on price alone and that that will be the
one fixed variable and of course we'll
compare platforms will test temperatures
I'm gonna shove a 3,800 into an X for
fit and the hex 450 and do a B 450
motherboard I'm gonna overclock the crap
out of it and we're gonna see what
happens like we're gonna do stuff like
that separate videos for all of that
stuff I'm really curious as to how well
a be 450 board is going to handle a
twelfth courtship really curious even
the 8 quart ships
I wonder how then 2 is going to fare in
terms of thermals do I think it's going
to be that much cooler no I really don't
the reason why I don't is because the
frequencies are higher and there are
trade-offs involved is it going to be
more efficient performance wise yes I
expect that we got that with Pascal from
Maxwell we got that I well I don't
really want to say we got that from
Pascal tutoring because Turing added a
ton of different stuff that really
changed the game and some of you feel
very strongly about that I understand
but I I don't expect the rise in 5 3,600
to be a significantly cooler CPU in fact
it will probably fair similarly in terms
of temperatures too it's then plus
counterpart the you risin 5 2600 will
Patterson is asking is be 450 better
than an X 470 and the answer is no X or
70 is the the more expensive chipset the
chipset loaded with more features so you
will want an X 470 motherboard if you
plan to do hefty overclocking in my
opinion with any of these higher core
comp chips okay let's see here Sam woods
asking why not be 350 and the reason for
that is I'm not entirely sure we're
going to have full support for that I
don't know yet the motherboards that I
have that be three of the board's I have
in the closet might not work so we're
just gonna have to wing it with what we
have I am I think I have a you know like
the cheapest be 350 PC mate motherboard
in there and I'd be more than happy to
do it if it would work but I know it's
gonna work with be 450 so that's a
straight up now maybe a separate video
on getting be 350 work to work with Zen
to but yeah we'll see I missed a super
chat up here I'm gonna get to that
I see fern Eva doll it's 50 Filipino I
don't know what that is but I appreciate
it thank you
he asks is it worth upgrading from Core
i5 6600 k2 horizon 5-2 or
600 it's kind of a vague question these
kinds of questions are very open-ended
and I know you guys don't realize it but
there's a lot that Heather's Pepsi right
right there it's a mess behind me it's
cuz I've been troubleshooting and
filming for video coming up later anyway
where was I I was just thinking okay so
we need to know more about your use case
scenario in order to give you an
informed purchase decision or an opinion
and I 560 senator Kay's is great for
gaming but the games nowadays are going
to start pushing for something a little
more than four cores 6 cores I'm telling
you is a sweet spot now but unless
you're starting to see games and really
choked up over your 4 cores I would wait
I mean if you're fine
gaming if you're comfortable gaming how
you are now then in my opinion there is
no point in paying able money for a
platform that you'll probably feel the
same way about in 3 or 4 years
I just don't know so I need to know more
about your a use case Robert wills
donated like two different $1 super
chats I wish there was a way I could
just like turn on like if you donate
like a dollar you can still ask a
question in the chat Cara it's stupid I
really don't like that like you have to
donate a minimum that like you have to
donate $1.99 to actually get to put
something in your super chat bubble I
hate that I'm trying to look for your
message if you if you asked a question
Robert I can't see it I I can't see it
I'm sorry but I appreciate it and yep
so Casey yes good question good question
is it better to overclock or let
precision boost do its thing and my
answer as of now based on my experience
with Zen Plus and Zen is that precision
boost and exif are a well EXO far it's
going to do a better job than you will
manually overclocking the layman who
just jumps in and does a 4.2 gig all
core overclocked and keeps v core on
auto which is cringe but it's the
easiest way to do it Rison has some room
to play with temperatures so whatever I
would recommend you start manually
tinkering voltage though and testing
if you have the time you're going to
have a better experience or an equitable
experience just enabling xfr so our
precision boost so if you know if you
really want to reap the most out of your
CPU and a lot of what you do is
multi-core enhanced then all core
overclocks makes sense actually far too
won't do that but in my opinion I think
that precision boost is good enough on
its own and I think that will be the
case for the 3600 as well especially the
non excuse because again I don't know if
it's going to scale these CPUs or know
that you have an X Q and there's a
little more TDP Headroom it's really
almost the same chip it's just slightly
better bin basically and not even that
sometimes it just it's just more heat
tolerant right it's more voltage
tolerance maybe that's what makes it an
X Q right because all of these chips are
bent right some of these four core chips
are six core chips that you see in in
AMD's lineup like the 3600 would it
could have been in an alternate universe
an 8 core or a 12 core chip right all
right well when you add the second chip
it's a it's a little different because
it's it's not just one big die with CC
X's now it's it's a triplet design so
it's a different architecture entirely
but if we just keep it with on on a one
triplet design like if you want to max
it out to eight cores it could have been
an eight core chip but maybe two of the
course just didn't pass the mark so AMD
deactivated those right so now you're
left with a 6 quart chip still
multi-threading but it's a six core now
not an eight core so that's how bending
works in a nutshell right
they just say do these cores pass the
mark if they do then great and will sell
it as an eight core chip does it handle
overclocking well does it handle heat
well can it handle you know lower
voltage as well maybe that makes it an X
cube let's give it a higher out-of-box
boost frequency there you go and now
it's an X Q right or maybe it's not an x
QB cuz it doesn't do that very well so
that's how companies creates queues
that's how they break them down that's
why you have more than just one offering
like AMD isn't just selling in a course
Q or
twelve core 16 threats q they're selling
multiple levels and you're paying for it
you're paying more for the better bin
chips right so that's how that works
mr. most mustache most mustache sheesh I
butchered the crap out of that but I
appreciate that $5.00 super chat you ask
is that a Breaking Benjamin shirt also
do you think AMD can catch intel for
single core actually yes it was a
Breaking Benjamin shirt it says Benjamin
down down there but yeah my favorite
band and I've seen them in concert three
or four times now and the latest I
actually the first time I saw Breaking
Benjamin in concert was with three days
grace and Flyleaf back in like Oh 809
made me when I was in high school so it
was at least 2010 but I went with
McLovin do you guys know my club and
Jacob we went with him and my dad and
one of my brothers and we drove to
Pensacola and we saw them that was
awesome that was like one of my favorite
concerts and I've seen them two more ten
since then back to your other question
do you think AMD can catch intel for
single core I don't think they're gonna
beat them I'll say that I don't think
based on what I've seen assuming some of
the leaks that will address here in a
second are accurate and some of these
websites I think are more reliable than
others when it comes to leaks
I think these leaks are pretty spot-on
though I don't think they're going to
beat Intel I think they're gonna come
awfully close to matching them and
that's good enough I want to make very
clear that I'm not wishing and that AMD
does worse I still think that there is
going to be a very very small case for
Intel in place of AMD part of it is
gonna have to do with the IGP I talked
about this at one point in a previous
video the fact that Intel skis have a
GPS helps certain workloads especially
when it comes to Adobe Premiere helps me
a lot
that's why my current system is a ninety
nine hundred K system because it helps
me significantly but I mean this chip
costs four hundred fifty five hundred
bucks like it's a ton of money you know
and sometimes more than five in a book
availability so it's a really expensive
chip do I get that much more performance
for my dollar out of it I don't think so
I think there's a there's a disconnect
there and I don't think people the
average person probably doesn't take the
time to actually weigh that out so I
don't think they're gonna beat them I
don't know what do you guys think about
that do you think they're going to beat
intel on the single core chart and what
I mean by that we you can say I PC say
whatever you want let's just use
Cinebench let's use Cinebench r15
because that's the one our twenties out
now that our 15s long we can we have
more scores to relate to there I really
don't think that we're going to see the
rise in 336 hundred I'll perform on a
clock for clock basis the age 700k I'm
not getting that vibe based on the the
leaks that I've seen I do think though
that it's gonna come within 5% and again
I'm happy with that and to some people
like that's that's not enough they still
they they want AMD to be ahead and
that's fine but you gotta be really
careful with but what some of you guys
are wishing for some of you guys really
want to see Intel just get destroyed and
like it's cool to see Intel kind of like
have to bend over and take from AMD
right that that's that's it that's it
part of me is like excited because it's
it's really just been Intel pushing it
for the longest time and now to see a
and B really changed the game in the cpu
consumer space and see Intel have to
kind of scramble to come up with
something especially while they're 10
nanometer node is just taking forever
it you don't want to wish though that
AMD just completely annihilates them and
and wipes them off the face of the earth
because first off that would be really
bad for the consumer in the sense that
we would suddenly have no more
competition and look whether you are you
know for AMD if you're a fanboy or not
you just you just pick the best value
and that's fine that's how I do it
you AMD is a business they're just like
Intel they're just like Nvidia they have
different numbers they have different
employees but their goals are the same
their goals are to make money for their
shareholders right to keep the business
afloat to keep the investors coming
they're just like every other business
in the in the world really and in the
any capitalistic society is going to
look at it this way and you know you
have to be capitalist to look at this
way to be completely Frank with you but
and AMD would I guarantee you if the
roles were reversed and they happened in
the past you'd have people on it on
Intel side rooting for Intel the same
way that AMD fanboys are not even just
fan boys just fans of AMD and I use
those terms of loosely but if you're a
fanboy I think it's a blind fandom of
something I don't like that I think that
is toxic and just not productive
but you can still root for a company you
can root for a company to catch up to
Intel and that's what we that's what we
have now but I think asking for Intel to
be just crushed again not good because
if you if you want until crushed then I
guarantee you Intel excuse me AMD is
gonna behave the same way and tell us
now they're gonna be whatever an
employee consumer they're not gonna be
making huge upgrades with CPUs every
generation they're gonna be very small
and incremental like they have been from
has both the skylake to coffee like to
coffee like to whatever you want to call
it right so we'll see anyway enough of
that rant it's a good question I'm just
gonna super shy here from more d'emic
Mort to 220 DKK aqui I have no idea what
that is Intel will rise again I am sure
just like like with p4 so it keeps
coming in waves right it's up and down
all the time
Intel really started falling off the
ball around 2011 2012 Isis a little
later than bulldozer piledriver but it
was good at first but it quickly showed
its age and Intel still had the IPC
crown and it was it was a bet AMD made
up they literally they made a bet and
they said yes this is how programs are
going to prioritize resources this is
how they're going to handle data and and
the pipeline workloads and then it ended
up not really being that way the
operating systems saw these CPUs at one
point is four core chips and you got a
like four core chips when they were
advertised as a core chips what the heck
is that where's that disconnect
and AMD made a bet that the programs
were going to utilize CPU architectures
differently than they do in actuality
and it didn't really play out for them
but look they learned from that they
came out with Rison they came out with a
Verizon Zen plus I came out with Zen -
you're gonna see results from that very
soon and I see I see comment from blaze
Intel isn't going to die they own the
market for years yes I know I know Intel
is not going to die they won't they
they've owned they still own the server
space ok they're not going anywhere
but I just want to caution people when
they say they want to see Intel fall
that is dangerous because that mentality
it's kind of like just like you're
seeing in a tunnel AMD is the savior of
the PC master-race and it's it's gonna
be good to see Intel just fall right
there
but you'll very quickly realize that AMD
is a business just like Intel so they
might be the good guys now but ten years
from now they might not be so that's why
you don't want to throw all of your
cards into one basket you want to
promote could you want to promote a
competition that's the word I'm looking
for
competition is healthy the more
competitors you have in a space the more
competitive the prices are that's good
for the consumer and that's good for
innovation too
you could argue that companies are
challenging other companies and the the
the need to be different is what drives
innovation so when everyone is we were
watching a documentary last night on it
was surfing something something about
surfing
it was Laird Hamilton and Laird Hamilton
one of the all-time great surfers right
and they were on I think it was Maui and
I remembers Maui or kawaii and in Hawaii
and they they were surfing and they
loved surfing he was doing some cool
stand-up stuff and they were
experimenting and they love to
experiment and they started taking these
jet skis and these jet skis were like
just coming out and they were using jet
skis or wave runners to pull surfers on
to the bigger waves further out and the
bigger reefs the bigger shelves a mile
offshore right that's that's a long way
to swim doesn't matter if you're a
strong swimmer
that's a long way to swim and they were
using wave runners and they were using
straps built into the surfboards they
were using to pull themselves onto these
big waves we're talking 30 40 even 50
footers waves that surfers before that
wouldn't have dared to even swum up to
then also to know that if you fell off
of one of those ways first off it's
gonna hurt bad I mean you're falling
three four stories sometimes that water
is gonna feel like concrete and then
you're gonna be just tossed and turn for
hundreds of yards under this stuff
thrown hundred feet underwater sometimes
like it's very scary and when you don't
have boats out there watching you and
you're just on your board and you lose
your board all of a sudden what do you
do you're a mile offshore right and then
the next wave comes up and pounds you
they started using wave runners to pull
surfers onto the big waves and it was
that innovation it was that just
out-of-the-box thinking to make
themselves different to allow them to
catch bigger waves that completely
changed the industry and now you watch
any surf show the wave runners are out
there they're pulling surfers onto these
massive waves that they couldn't get up
on their own and so yeah anyway that
little tangent there I just came to mind
cuz I was watching that last night with
my brother we like watching those kinds
of documentaries it's it's that kind of
competition the drives innovation when
everyone's doing the same thing and you
want to be different like I hate to say
it like the whole thing different think
differently things from Apple like
that's a real thing it's a powerful
thing because that is what drives
innovation I want to see its we have a
super shot from Ben Grogan 5euro I
appreciate that thank you Ben if a MVC
is a lead in peak performance do you see
them match and tell us peak prices or
keep below for fast market share gains
good question I never really thought
about how AMD you would approach this I
think they saw this coming I think they
knew they were gonna be just
neck-and-neck with Intel especially now
that Intel's been falling behind in the
R&amp;amp;D debarments this is no secret 10
nanometers is further out than we
thought it would be and honestly the
stuff that they push to market right so
the the the notebook SKUs of 10
nanometer stuff it
really kind of a cut-down version of
what they initially wanted it to be I
mean these these chips are running
essentially underclock there's way more
there's a lot of performance gap there
that they like to see closed in the
problem is the fab is just not getting
it right these chips are not being
literally fabricated as well as they
would like them to be and that's part of
the issue with the entire node of the
entire process it's taking them longer
to produce chips that they think are
viable for market and so it kind of felt
rushed the whole notebook 10 nanometers
thing anyway that is uh that is
something that Intel knows is coming is
AMD is here and now that they're here
does AMD decide to raise prices in
response to Intel's stubbornness right
being that they've they've been the the
market leader for a very long time and
they have objectively the better chip
when it comes to just raw IPC a better
single core performance which is useful
for a lot of things because a lot of
programs rely on just one or two cores
now that AMD is at that point now do
they suddenly respond by raising prices
because they can because Intel left that
gap there Intel saying I'm not budging
anymore I'm already really high up there
and in terms of price and we've come
down a little bit but we're a premium
company we charge more because we can
because we're Intel and I'm not saying
until it actually says this but this
could be the scenario anybody's saying
well there's nothing too special about
you now you might own more market share
but we're coming up on your heels and
we're gonna start taking over some of
your server spaces well and and look our
IPC differences are within the margin of
error you know why are you charging way
more than we are and Intel's gonna say
because people are still buying our
product and that's true they are people
are still buying Intel skews even though
you know inventories are there they've
been dried up to an extensive but
they're starting to come back and the 14
enemy or stuff started starting to make
its way out again part of the reason
again because they're fabricating both
the chipsets and the desktop consumer
grade SKUs on the same fab which is kind
of holding up production to
and that is something that I don't think
Intel is going to respond to favorably I
think they are going to lower prices
they have to I think strategically
financially they have no choice but to
lower prices but honestly a 10% price
cut isn't gonna cut it it's just not
gonna it's it's not gonna fill the gap
consider the 8700 K again if I went onto
let's go into Amazon right now I know
you guys can't see this I'm just gonna
do this off-the-cuff let's go to Amazon
and let's let's look up what an 8700 K
is going for right now I want to buy an
8700 K right now it's not in stock it'll
be in stock tomorrow 350 bucks so three
hundred and fifty dollars for that you
guys you guys be the judge
350 bucks okay four and 8700 K it's a
great great CPU one of the best gaming
CPUs in the market or 3,600 which might
not be as good it's gonna be awfully
close this time around we we we know
that's its own almost certain okay I
would be surprised if it wasn't within
five percent okay even when we're
talking about frame rates in-game I
don't think there's gonna be a huge
disparity and there wasn't before
Amiens n+ was was closing the gap but I
think this time around it's just gonna
it's gonna be that extra step that they
need to get on the same playing field as
Intel with that at 200 bucks
you have to Intel has to slash prices by
at least $100 they had to slash prices
by at least 30% and they're not gonna do
it there's no way they did they can't I
don't even I would be surprised if they
even budget it for that kind of slash so
I honestly expect that AMD is going to I
think they're gonna keep prices the way
they are and the reason why first off is
because Intel they know Intel isn't
gonna raise I mean they can't raise
prices if they do it's just in response
to a supply shortage but the demand
especially after this new launch I think
is going to shrink in the consumer space
they're going to have it's gonna be
difficult but I I think and I think AMD
is going to stay at the same place they
already were
in terms of price and I think they're
just gonna milk it because they can
because they've budgeted it that way
back to the budget thing with Intel I
don't think and I don't think Intel has
the the financial flexibility to cut CPU
prices by that degree they just didn't
go into this expanse
I'm een maybe they expected it but that
if they had expected it to this extent
then they would have probably slashed
prices a little more now I know we're
seeing some articles talking about how
high Intel is gonna have to respond with
maybe a 15% price cut that's still not
gonna do it for me it's not enough it's
not justified in my eyes yet so when I
review the 3600 against the insert $200
Intel CPU here then 9600 9600 K I don't
know there's just one of those core i5
chips because that's what it's gonna be
we're gonna be running streaming
benchmarks we're gonna be running game
benchmarks we're gonna be doing a ton of
stuff productivity benchmarks I'm gonna
give you the full spiel I'm sure most
channels out there will and again I
encourage you to watch more than one or
two channels you guys really need
multiple points of view here but I am
I'm gonna show you everything and I
would be very surprised if my conclusion
around the 2600 and the 2600 X is the
same as it is for the 3,600 because now
that the gap is narrowed and the prices
remained the same that's it that's a big
jump that's a that's a I mean that's a
Maxwell with a Pascal jump that's why I
was so excited about what Nvidia did
back then it was a big jump and prices
were beautiful and AMD is giving us that
much more they're giving us performance
that is so close to Intel's now and
we're just gonna be oh man we're gonna
be barely hitting 200 bucks for a 6 core
12 thread chip comparable in performance
we expect to be based on the leaks based
on Cinebench runs at least to the 8700 K
which is a cpu that cost 150 dollars
more you can buy almost to our 536
hundreds for the price of one 8700 K and
that's assuming an 87 or KDS even its
stock right because until still trying
to catch up and the supply chain
so whoa okay
all right I know it seems sensationalist
it does it probably comes across that
way and I apologize I don't mean to hype
this up beyond what I think it should be
but the rising 5:30 600 is going to be
one of the best selling chips I expect
that AMD ever ever sells the 1600
already was it was a very very popular
chip and I just read Brian's good that's
good that was good
I appreciate the dollar ninety-nine it
says Brian from bps custom says I hear
my videos will be the best ones to watch
and you're probably right look if you're
neglecting my boy Brian's stuff oh you
know what Brian that reminds me I got to
get that I got to get that sweater okay
I'll post a picture I got I'll post a
picture of me wearing it after the
stream but Brian sent me a dope looking
sweater and I think you guys are really
gonna love it
anyway I think I missed another super
chat up here let me get to that very
quickly no one's looking you know a tube
is asking if he should upgrade is 17
Ardex with the new stuff which which
mostly gaming if you're doing most of
the gaming I think you'll benefit from
an upgrade especially if you don't have
to upgrade motherboards so if you can if
you can find a way to get your
motherboard to work on the new stuff I
think an upgrade CPU wise would be
really good um I really think a 3600 is
going to do to be a big improvement over
the 1700 with respect to games based on
what we're seeing so far I would wait
for reviews obviously don't preorder or
whatever even if you can do that that
would be really weird and Dom in my
opinion but I think you would benefit
from an upgrade from mostly gaming yes
let's see yeah scrolling up I missed one
from the demo dem on Flair de demon
flair huh I don't know if that was even
directed at me but he added somebody and
said I just got a rise in 569 474 bucks
and I think was a really good deal today
I waste my money not waiting for the
news and processors ok good question
so 3,600 for 200 bucks right 2600 for
140 maybe even cheaper than that and
then 1600 for 70 bucks 80 bucks you can
get these things dirt cheap and micro
Center
is it justified opting for the first gen
stuff for less than half the price of
the new gen the only way you can justify
this is if you don't have the money to
spend on the new platform that's the
only way you can justify it
josh is saying I'm speaking to quiet but
I am in the yellow on my end so it's on
your end there you have to a tube and
says here have another $1 free super
Thank You a2 if I appreciate I saw your
earlier one as well I'm glad I got there
Jack I'm glad I got to find your
question I appreciate that I always lose
my train of thought when this happened
that's okay though I appreciate it
the cheaper sentence and plus CPS the 60
hundred an incredible deal but it all
depends on what your budget allows so if
your budget is 500 bucks the 1600 is an
absolute steal at that price hands down
if your budget is even if your budgets
five six hundred bucks you could
probably work in and horizon 520 600 in
fact I think we've done something very
similar to that on the channel if I
haven't already I'll try to make that
work if you have a budget of around $800
to $1,000
I think the 3600 is justified so it all
depends on your budget if you can't
afford the new stuff that's okay I've
been in the exact same boat it makes
more sense to buy the older gents tough
at a much better price you will get more
about more value for your money frankly
in my opinion I don't know exactly how
these things are gonna play out but I
honestly believe that the 2600 and the
1600 both at around a hundred bucks or
less are going to be epic organs just
like with used graphics cards even if
the the CPUs themselves aren't used even
if they are who cares it's a CPU like
you have to do some really awful stuff
physically to a CPU to damage it to the
point where you can tell that it's
actually been used so if you're if
you're in the use market and you're
hunting in the use market for a CPU
maybe a full-on platform like a 1600 and
a B through 50 motherboard and 16 gigs
of ram and you can get all of that for
200 you know or 250 I don't know what
would be a good deal I'd if it's 16
of RAM 250 let's say 250 for that
platform is really impressive look you
could only get the rice and 5 3600 for
that price and then maybe a nice cooler
right so in in my opinion it all depends
on your budget if you can make room in
your budget for the more expensive stuff
in my opinion it's justified if you
can't if your budget is tighter I would
almost always recommend you go with
horizon 5 1600 or 2600 over the Intel
counterparts in my opinion it's just
better bang for the buck they depreciate
faster and like if I wanted to build my
first Intel system since I started doing
the channel it was an i3 4150 you know
what that cpu sells for right now on
ebay it's insane like why would anyone
pay that much for an i3 that's five
years old right and Intel CPUs a little
different and Intel CPUs tend to
depreciate a bit more but that doesn't
that's not a bad thing that doesn't say
anything necessarily about the brand
it's just that aimed he was already
cheap to begin with right and so to
upgrade chips it's really not gonna be
that expensive for one so that puts more
sorry about that that that puts more of
the cheaper chips into the hands of use
buyers and for to mean they were already
cheap to begin with and they're still
selling some of these CPUs new on sites
like Amazon and even new egg and eBay so
if you can find these new for a hundred
bucks then and you're concerned about
buying use then in my opinion that's the
better bet but if you have the money to
buy the new platform I really think you
would do yourself a service to invest in
the new platform especially after you
see reviews I don't again I don't want
you guys going to this just headstrong
completely closed-minded about buying at
3600 or a 30 whatever doesn't matter and
12 core 16 core variant doesn't matter
in my eyes if you have the money keep an
open mind because our reviews might
might persuade you to buy that the 6
core variant versus the 8 core variants
we might persuade you to buy the X
variant or the non X variant right it's
all kind of fluid it's subject to change
that's what I enjoy about this this job
so stay tuned for that
again those those reviews will be coming
out very soon and you guys should be amp
because I expect the competition
we'll be more fierce than it has been in
a very very long time okay so that was a
touch on the used market hmm let me
scroll up here I wanna dress a few
questions I see bends I see been super
chat and I get to that a second I get
some questions here from folks who are
not sending super chats let's see here
no one cares is that science today do
you think 3700 X will overclock the same
on 36 3800 X on all cores or with a 3800
X need less voltage it's going to depend
I think there is going to be a little
bit of both involved do I think it's
gonna be substantial enough to justify
the price difference not really
so I mean again if you have the money
just to kind of throw out there and you
want peace of mind then going for the
higher SKU just makes sense but if
you're a budget conscious buyer and the
target audience of AMD risin is
definitely the budget conscious buyer
the value conscious buyer I should say
it's probably the more accurate
appropriate term then the 3700 X is
probably gonna be your better bet again
just kind of I'm just just raw doggin 8
here I don't know yet but I'm telling
you based on what I've seen in the past
that this is you know especially with
the X versus non-experienced which is
essentially what this is they're both
excused but like maybe this is like a
Indies way of saying well we want our
excuse to be a little more special so
we're just gonna make all the higher
court count ships excuse I don't know
like maybe they come up with that excuse
in the counter or whatever I have no
idea but in my experience if the clock
speed is the only difference then yes
there's a bidding disparity but is it
substantial enough just 550 $60 even
$100 disparity in price in my opinion I
don't think so I don't see that
happening so and keep an open mind
well like well you guys know about these
things before you buy and we'll let you
know as soon as possible the faster we
get our content out the better it does
on YouTube like there's an incentive to
publish first we don't have publish so
fast that we don't get all the
information out to you but we wanted to
be as comprehensive and as possible and
we want to push it out as quickly as
possible for you because it benefits you
as the as the purchaser so that things
don't go out of stock quickly and it
also benefits us in the YouTube space
because the videos that obviously are
like the first to break the story are
going to be more successful on the
channel on the platform
yeah um so you scroll down here I missed
I'm gonna get to bend superjet here one
more quickly what makes server chips
besides ECC support anybody confirmed
ECC might East consumer board plus 16
core chip replacing Intel entry-level
servers there are a few different things
server like server chipsets are
different so server CPUs that are
intended to be used in conjunction with
server chipsets can be different the way
in which they allocate lanes all of that
will differ from just a generic
consumer-grade board so there's a lot to
consider and it's not going to be the
same for every server great board out
there but what I can tell you is that a
lot of it is just going to be who they
market it to so same thing with ISPs
right if I went to Comcast and I told
them yeah look I run a small business
and I'm looking to start up like a a
business home Internet solution
nambeesan Comcast cuz my parents had
Comcast back when I used to live with
them before I was in college and Comcast
was pretty trash so I feel this is a
good use so Comcast will say ok so you
want a business plan what do you want
Meigs ups and ups and downs I would say
like let's just say if they offer a gig
solution up and down gigabit internet
right they might charge the business
like four or five hundred bucks a month
now the advantage is for the business
you get quicker support so if you call
Comcast business you're probably gonna
get someone on the line pretty fast and
that's because these are like these are
entire businesses relying on your
internet businesses have more weight
than an individual consumer in general
so they're going to prioritize the
business first they separate the Suites
so that they can treat them differently
right this is this is the case with a
lot of different stuff I'm just using
ISPs because a lot of people can write
in on this channel than I speak now a
Comcast consumer or whatever they call
it Comcast residential will be a lot
cheaper for the same internet speeds but
the exact same internet speeds you get
different support and I'm not trying to
say that with server board you're gonna
get better support although on a very
general sense that is probably the case
if you're buying a server board and a
servers
skew obviously ECC memory is a big
advantage but it a lot of it has to do
with the chipset a lot of it has to do
with support like server server chips in
general won't usually have I GPS server
chips in general it can be cheaper than
their consumer grade counterparts one of
the reasons why would be I GPS but they
can also be more expensive because of
ECC memory they give you more expensive
because maybe the platforms are more
expensive maybe the motherboards are
more expensive so from a finance
point of view you could say well because
the motherboards are more expensive it
just makes sense to charge more for the
CPUs are gonna be using in the
motherboards right why not because
people are gonna pay to anyway they're
paying this much more for the
motherboards so just a way to get you to
look at it you can pull up spec sheets
and look at all the advantages of a Xeon
ship for example but a lot of it has to
do with how they market it honestly
that's a good so a really big deal let's
see yeah a good point mister insights
that business is PS get priority traffic
and that is the case for I know of at
least I know Comcast does it for sure
that's why you see example I'm not sure
how other ISPs handle it but businesses
again are more important you're going to
treat them like first-class citizens
because they pay more right and they
usually have a lot broader clientele and
if the business isn't getting service
from the ISP then the business is going
to use that excuse to its clients and
then its clients know that that isp is
just terrible so you really want to make
sure that they're happy let's see here
follow neuroscience studio got a 69 50 X
4.3 gigahertz last year for 600 euro
cheaper not to downgrade from X 99 to a
consumer board is the 16 ffd X going to
stand against arisin 3 not expecting to
win yeah I mean that's like those are
very very different platforms 3
different target audiences I don't think
yeah I don't know I can't say for sure
I've been charged at the 6900 X you can
compare that to something like consumer
grade ship like the 8700 K or the 6700 K
but if you're already on that platform
you put all that money into it
just stick with that as long as you can
there's no reason to really downgrade
per se unless you want to just sell out
right now if you can sell that platform
and get a lot of money then I think
that's a wise choice because that
platform is a dead end and if you invest
and say the aim for platform or whatever
I could be whatever Intel offers next
and I think you'd be doing yourself a
favor depends on how much you can sell
that platform you're currently on x99
for so we'll see rx 299 is X - no no no
X 99 yeah X 99
that's you them all confused anyway now
a couple more questions here and then
we'll wrap this one I appreciate you
guys for watching about 600 people
watching it's pretty awesome and I I'm
seeing a ton I literally had the chat
pulled up right so what I've been
looking at this whole time the cameras
there but I've been looking at a chat
the whole time I'll make sure I didn't
miss any super chats your real quick Ian
Thompson asked is it worth the money to
go with X 570 over X 474 3700 my answer
is no it does not and the reason why I'm
saying it's not it's because AMD told me
that it's not AMD said if you have X 4
70 unless you want like support for PCI
for maybe have like a Gen 4 M to drive
and you want to reap the benefits of
like a faster drive then I might be one
of the reasons why you should go with X
570 but AM be straight up told me to my
face that people on X 470 are already
good enough like they're not gonna any
issues so I take that at face it I mean
if anybody's telling you that like I
wouldn't trust the motherboard vendors
per se because the mother word vendors
want to sell any boards like that's a
goal Affairs it's like when MSI like MSI
told I forget who it was a MSI told
somebody that or I saw it in a chat or
comment or something MSI said that they
recommend upgrading to x5 74 there for
the latest is n2 boards I think they
said something along those lines and my
response to that was well of course they
did they want to sell those motherboards
they have to make a case for them and in
my eyes now the only case that I see is
using some really freaking fast put the
nvme in about two drives because that's
really the only place you're gonna see a
Gen 4 PC agent for actually work out
apart from that chipset wise
feature wise you're not going to see
much of a difference when X 4 7
seventy so if you already have X 470 my
advice to you even before I get these
CPUs is don't upgrade because I've been
told enough about these chips from AMD
directly
I've been till now for those chipset
excuse me that I'm confident enough to
say that that you shouldn't expect to
buy a new motherboard if you're already
on even be 450 I would wait be 450 might
work as well I expect it will but
overclocking potential we're not sure
yet I'm gonna throw a really expensive
rise in CPU and would be 450 board and
I'll tell you how it fares and I'll try
to do the same with a be 350 I did that
with the 2700 X I'm pretty sure I threw
that in a beef 350 board as well
terrible VRMs on that board and it still
worked I know the pretty hot toasty vrm
is but you know we'll see oh gosh
alright let's do um oh plus 2 C I super
chatted mm-hmm asked if Rison based a
core CPUs for consoles will make six
cores of bottleneck no I don't really
think so because the way that consoles
have done this in the past especially
like them I know the ps4 I think I think
the piss where did this like what the
ps4 does and what other consoles tend to
do is they will allocate one or two
cores for certain tasks and then the
other six cores for processing games
rendering things of that sort
right draws calls from the GPU well it's
an APU so it's really kind of that's not
really accurate I didn't think about
that but typically you'll see cores kind
of blocked off for certain tasks so like
one core might be to run the home screen
and that's why whenever you click that
the home button on the playstation
controller whenever you click little
PlayStation icon you go straight to the
home screen now it's cached in memory
obviously but the CPU is there to handle
that so there are different ways to
allocate CPU usage and that is why I
don't think it's going to radically
change the way devs look at core count
it has changed it to an extent since the
release of Rison 1 but I don't think
it's gonna suddenly make 6 core chips
obsolete I don't believe that will be
the case and one more super to hear from
go to e3 64 Dynasty which I appreciate
that thank you he says what's up man
quick question is it worth the upgrade
to go
my 1600 X to an 1800 X I have a 2070
depends on what you do again if you're
if you're just gaming you're not gonna
see a big difference at all these games
the difference between six and eight
cores in most games is negligible so
your frame rate might not even go up in
fact it might go down a little bit you
never know and so and if you're if
you're trying to stay within the same
family yeah I would definitely say pass
on that if you're doing some heavy
streaming and you see your your CPU
utilization being maxed out in a lot of
games that you're playing then that
might be a case for it but in general I
would say no that's not a good idea I
would consider either the you know if
you can sell your 1,600 X for 50 bucks
60 bucks maybe a little more than that
and you want to get a newer CPU I would
look heavily into Zen - that's rising
3,000 or some higher core count Zen plus
so like the 2700 possibly that would be
a pretty worthy upgrade and you would
see definite gains especially with
respect to XMP support and slight PC
bums frequency bums will help across the
board alright folks you guys been
awesome I appreciate all of those who
have watched especially through to the
end again if you want to become a member
and you want to have those like
one-on-one chats or gonna be pretty much
close to one-on-one every Saturday just
before we do these live streams then I
click that number click that joint icon
just below this window but I mean if not
it's not a big deal you guys can still
chat with me here in the live stream we
just have to deal with more people and
that's a good thing I appreciate that I
appreciate all of you watching and stay
tuned for plenty of this content like I
haven't really released many videos
about AMD since copy text and that's
just because it's like it's easy to milk
that stuff reviews and there's a lot of
content I look at a lot of channels are
actually pushing out good content about
this but I don't want to push anything
out personally on the site I know enough
about it and I've had enough hands-on
experience in regards to it so
speculations I'll stay for live streams
looking forward to the future and for
general content we'll keep doing things
that we typically do on the channel
reviews cool experiments and some minute
science and crash course stuff thanks
again for watching and I will catch you
all in
and the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
