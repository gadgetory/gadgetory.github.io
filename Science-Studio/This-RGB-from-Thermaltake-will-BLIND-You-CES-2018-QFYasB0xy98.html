wow this is awkward what's going on
everyone we are in the Thermaltake suite
here at where are we we were I don't
even know where we are this is a
Venetian yeah what's going on everyone
we are here in the thermaltake suite at
the Venetian in Las Vegas for CES 2018 I
try to say it like four times but we are
I'm tired of saying the same thing let's
say alright what's going on everyone we
are here in the thermaltake suite at the
Venetian for CES 2018 we're gonna kick
things off here with a very cool mod by
Mike Petr ins I actually know the guy
not personally but I do follow him on
Facebook and elsewhere he has created
something that many of you overwatch
lovers would in fact love apparently
this is one of the characters you can
play as I'm totally gonna do this build
a disservice cuz I don't play overwatch
but I think it looks absolutely dope it
is custom cool and he's even modded this
case here to make things look a bit more
overwatch II I guess so if you want
things to be bumpin he's even built in
full-on DJ setup up top he's even 3d
printed hinges for the view 71 panel
just pretty sweet RGB LEDs everywhere of
course we're sticking with green to fill
the theme and I mean he's he's literally
he's just paid so close attention to the
detail here in this we have a modded
power button 3d printed basically fan
grills up front I feel like there's just
so much here I'm not gonna be able to
touch on all of it but this is a
beautiful a beautiful mod in the thermal
taking you 71 and another mod this one's
built in the Thermaltake core p90 kind
of a three dimensional case it
essentially wraps around itself
now ggf events actually modded this case
to fit their needs to make this thing
look absolutely stunning they pretty
much do custom loops galore I mean out
there YouTube channel that's pretty much
all they do and they are pros at it so
they have the Intel extra nine and
platform and they have a GTX 10 in DTI
with as otech waterblock and then
wrapping things around here for
individual it looks like 60 mil thick
120 rads and they've basically run all
these tubes into the center console of
this chat
see to just make things look super super
clean big fan of this I also love the
black and was it purple or pink color
scheme now if you remember our Computex
2017 coverage you probably also remember
the level 20 case this was actually like
one of the main centerpieces of their
booth it was a huge booth and one of the
show halls and they've actually refined
things just a bit here so they've taken
in some feedback they've made the case
slightly thicker to provide the the
vertical graphics card if you so choose
to do it this way to give it a little
bit more breathing room so most of the
vertical graphics cards are pressed
right against that tempered glass panel
basically that left side panel so
there's not much air intake through
these fans
well they've widened things so there is
about an inch or two ortho thermal
shouldn't be as big an issue as they
were before of course your custom water
cooling your graphics card then you
shouldn't have to worry much about that
at all
everything is kind of compartmentalized
here but that's what gives it that like
furniture like showpiece feeling got the
power supply up top they've got tubes
running in absolutely all directions and
we have a reservoir and our radiator
over on the right hand side all of these
by the way are all hinged tempered glass
panels now I'm sure most of you remember
the Corp III actually built in it kind
of reviewed it in this video on this
side of the screen but they have made a
few revisions the most prominent of
those being the inclusion of tempered
glass so you can get a standard just
squared off tempered glass panel for
this case you can even purchase one with
it or you can buy it separately I'm
pretty sure and then if you want to pay
a bit extra they're not hiding the fact
that this is an optional optional
upgrade that is pretty pricey you can
get a curved tempered glass panel like
this one here now it literally bends 90
degrees you know a few other companies
have tried into the 45 degrees but this
is very very difficult technically to do
and because of that it was gonna cost
around a hundred bucks if you want one
and they did say that it usually
requires 20 or 30 takes before one of
these actually is like passes the mark
right so 20 or 30 of them get thrown
away or just break in production because
this is so difficult to do being that
you're trying to get glass to curve
evenly all the way down the chassis now
let's throw out a hypothetical here
so you have an MSI motherboard and you
have a bunch of thermal take gear that
you want to sync up with that MSI
motherboard this box right here allows
you to control all of their Hardware
with MSI software or gigabytes software
or a su software built into the
motherboard you have usually an RGB W 12
volt fan header at least any recently
developed motherboard and all you got to
do is connect this box right here the
sync controller to one of those 5 pin
headers on their board powered via SATA
thank God it ain't molex so glad they
did this and then you can literally hop
into let's say or a software which is
what this computer to my right is
running this is a gigabyte motherboard
with a bunch of Thermaltake hardware in
it and we can just click pulse and have
it sync to music we're literally using
gigabyte software to control Thermaltake
hardware which is super cool and
intuitive it basically eliminates the
need to download multiple applications
on your desktop to control multiple
Hardware interfaces something else we
want to highlight this is the new 71
tempered glass Edition you get it now
but you can't get it in white yet this
is in development of course it's you
know they're just trying to keep
components white but keeping things
white it's actually pretty difficult to
do talking with some hardware vendors
it's difficult to get all the different
components to perfectly match because
there are different shades of white
right there's a bluish white there's a
reddish white so it actually takes some
time to perfect and that's what they're
seeking to do here with the Vue 71 TG
white Edition it's got all the typical
view 71 accents you can adjust your
radiators up top you can push them
really far back or really far forward
you can shift your radiator that's
mounted vertically and against the right
side panel you've even got a drain port
down here at the bottom that you can
utilize if you want to throw a custom
loop in here which I recommend doing you
know I'm not the biggest fan of large
cases not having their space completely
occupied by gear right you're gonna buy
a large case at least fill it up with
try your best with hard drives or with
custom loop gear it kind of makes sense
and we actually have a space to drain
your fluid at the bottom which is really
cool I like seeing stuff like that so
case vendors making things just a bit
easier for us custom loo builders out
there I also like the fact that you can
swivel the tempered glass door now an
issue I've come across when building
custom loops
particularly when I have like SLI
graphics cards let's say you have a tube
right that's kind of specked out to fit
inside two sleeves right but that tube
is gonna be longer than the distance
between the the sleeve so you have to
kind of wedge it inside one and then
tilt your graphics card up and then
wedge it inside the other and then it's
a perfect fit but what thermaltake is
has done to remedy this issue is produce
something called the C pro there's a C
pro fitting it consists of three
different parts so the typical two right
so you have the sleeve and you have the
collar well in this case you have a base
that you screw into any standard G
quarter fitting also has a built-in
oring and then you have they're calling
this the sleeve this is what you slide
all the way down your tubing to the base
you're gonna just line that up with the
base itself and then slide the collar on
top now the threading is actually on the
base right so the collar is threading
into the base you have the ring
protecting the fluid flow they're just
literally secure it just like that you
can you can slide the tubing into the
base you don't have to worry about
trying to get this thing to to fit on
one side and then fit on the other and
kind of like you know bending your
tubing to do that I have done that many
times not just with like SLI or
crossfire graphics cards so it's as
simple as pulling that tube over on top
of the base drop the collar down twist
it in place and boom there you go you
got a really secure - all right we
always have a blast touring thermaltake
setups particularly here at CES I like
how they've taken in that consumer
feedback and they've improved
pre-existing products their whole goal
right it's to sell product that's the
goal of any tech company out there and
you sell products by listening to your
customers and that's exactly what
Thermaltake seeks to do time and time
again I'm a big fan of level twenty over
there I'm a big fan of the new p90 that
three-dimensional looking case and I
always love the custom loops and mods
they show off at these events if you
liked this video be sure you give a
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
this is gonna be our last video at CES
2018 thanks for checking us out we will
catch you in the next one this is wow
it's you in the next one I've literally
said it like five hundred times
yeah I've said it like five hundred
times let's play the first time ever
messed it up
this is science to do thanks
or touring with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
