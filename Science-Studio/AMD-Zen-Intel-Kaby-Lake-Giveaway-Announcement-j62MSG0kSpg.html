of the candid GT x 1080 giveaway that
person is an AFOL right hand sia sorry
if i butchered that name it looks like
you're from india and if also i'll be
giving you a DM in instagram in the
coming hours after I edit this video
here congratulations on the win again it
doesn't matter where you live folks I
mean it's either gonna be the card
itself that I deliver to you or if
that's not possible I'll be sending you
the equivalent US dollar amount of
whatever the card costs in this case
candid delegated 620 US dollars for GT X
1080 so worst case that's what you'll
get but I'm gonna try my best to get the
card over there because another card is
extremely expensive in many places
around the world now let's discuss the
topic of this video and that is AMD Zen
vs. intel kb lake in particular i want
to test the viability of AMD Zen claims
there are 40% IPC jump and also they're
very intriguing head-to-head comparison
between their 8 core 16 threads and
behemoth and the i7 6900 k which I
should mention is a $1000 processor this
video is not going to be very long I'm
not a huge fan of strictly speculation
videos although there are a few things
that we can say are substantially
different between Zen and old FX
architecture namely bulldozer and
piledriver architectures we'll also be
using excavator as a stepping stone if
you will to get to that 40% IPC
improvement between excavator and Zen
that AMD has been touting for months and
on Intel side will be discussing whether
or not waiting for KP lake is even a
smart idea especially if you're sporting
a skylake processor right now and
whether or not Zen has anything to worry
about when it comes to that new Intel
architecture which spoiler alert isn't
really all that different first things
first let's validate AMD's claim that
Zen is in fact a 40 percent IPC
improvement over excavator thankfully we
have a physical benchmark for this but I
will say as a disclaimer this is a test
conducted by AMD in an effort to promote
an AMD product I'm not sayin that AMD
would skew their results in an effort to
make their product look superior to
their competitors but this is a company
we're talking about I would say the
exact same thing about Intel Starbucks
you get the point if you want my two
cents I say wait into our viewers like
myself and others get our hands on these
processors put the
head-to-head clock for clock and we'll
really see what these things can do
until then I would take everything that
you see with a grain of salt so in this
test right here an AMD eight core 16
threads n CPU with simultaneous
multi-threading it's basically AMD's
equivalent to hyper threading barely
outperforms an i7 6900 k both of which
are running at the exact same frequency
this is just one test mind you and i do
expect that AMD took that engineering
sample and threw it in a batch of tests
against the 6900 k found that the
blender test resulted in the greatest
disparity and decided to showcase so
that went to the public just because it
does make send look the best i don't
blame them i would do it too it is
possible that the 6900 k outperformed
the Xen counterpart and something like
Cinebench r15 they just decided not to
show that one because well it's not
gonna make their cpu look as good as the
thousand-dollar competitor nonetheless
we can use this performance test to
validate AMD zenzai pc claim now because
IPC which stands for instructions per
clock is a measurement essentially of
single core performance at a given
frequency we can correlate multiple
architectures this isn't an exact
science and you can't correlate these
relationships to frame rate increases
for example they just give us rough
estimates of general architectural
improvements and how much faster a CPU
can process data let's start off with
piledriver as our baseline this is the
FX line up the FX 6300 8350 you get the
point because it's our baseline we're
gonna say that this IPC is 100 it's just
easier to correlate that way but we
could say it's one a million it's an
arbitrary number as long as all of our
other scores are in reference to that
baseline we'll be good to go
the first major jump for AMD was the
release of the excavator architecture a
notable 15% IPC improvement over
piledriver you get these numbers by the
way by multiplying the equivalent
decimal increase in IPC by the previous
baseline so in this case point 1 5 times
100 take that product and add it to the
previous baseline that's 115 you're
seeing here and now for the jump from
excavator to Xen AMD does of course
claim the 40% IPC boost so take point 4
multiply it by 115 and then take that
product add it to the previous baseline
of 115 field roughly 160 or so which you
can read this two ways you can say that
it's either a 40 percent improvement
over
excavator or because piledriver is our
baseline of 100 roughly 61% IPC
improvement over piledriver now let's
quickly move on over to Intel Ivy Bridge
had an IPC improvement over at
piledriver of about 50% or so and these
architectures were released around the
same time at this point
AMD favored higher core counts and Intel
favored higher single core performance
which is why you see these IPC
disparities here
one company baked on one thing and the
other company banked on another so with
Ivy Bridge is our baseline on the Intel
side at roughly 150 we can correlate the
other IPC improvements from Haswell to
Broadwell easy to skylake if you notice
here these three jumps are indicative
about a 4% IPC improvement over all
Intel really hasn't been pushing it
lately and that's something that I hope
Xen changes if we do the math this Lance
has well at 156 Broadwell e at 162 and
skylake at 168 now let's merge both our
Intel and Xen IPC graphs and check that
out
Zen and Broadwell e are literally
neck-and-neck I would say within the
margin of error if our original IPC
improvements are correct and that falls
exactly in line with what AMD showed us
in their blender test now because of
what we just saw I would say with
relative certainty that what AMD did
show us with their 8 core 16 thread CPU
is accurate now this goes back to
something we mentioned just a bit
earlier when we talk about the
generation jumps from Haswell to
Broadwell e to skylake and even a kb
lake the focus for them has been more on
single core performance improvements and
not necessarily packing more cores into
a single die
this can have substantial impacts on the
frame rates that you've seen in games as
well as how programs utilize their
various cores at their disposal now
frequency also plays a role there
essentially cores versus clocks we've
discussed that in a few videos but when
it comes to AMD it seems like Xen is
taking the exact same approach that its
predecessor piledriver did several years
earlier what this tells me is that AMD
is still focused on future proofing
their CPUs banking on the fact that
multiple programs will be able to
utilize more than four cores efficiently
in the next few years that by the way is
what ultimately led to the downfall of
bulldozer and piledriver back in 2011
see this video right here for more
details nonetheless based on what we
know and can safely speculate I do
expect that a fork or eight threads n
CPU will compete admirably against a
6700 case skylake counterpart clock for
clock that's good news for those are you
interested in something that's well more
affordable than the Intel equivalent now
let's change vantage points from Intel's
point of view kb lake not a huge
improvement over sky lake there are few
architectural changes we're still
running on a 14 nanometer process a few
changes in the h.265 codec how videos
are interpreted TDP power draws slightly
different but for the most part it's
just a refined 6700 K and you won't see
more than any difference with the KB
Lake processors over the skylake
processors maybe when it comes to
motherboard features and things like
that but if you're currently sporting a
66 or 67 hundred K or I would argue even
a 4647 90k that jump from house well or
sky lake 2 kb lake is not justified by a
350 or so US dollar price tag you could
make the case that kb lake brought
substantial improvements to the mobile
side of things actually you know what
not you really can't
apart from marginal battery life
increases I would say same thing
buying a 6200 u instead of a 7200 u is
actually going to be the smarter thing
to do if it means saving 300 bucks it's
just the trend until it's been on lately
and I expect that a large chunk of that
reason is because AMD really hasn't
given them anything with which to
compete I mean just look at these IPC
changes for Intel in this case we want
to see a very shallow trendline
indicative of substantial improvements
from generation to generation but we're
not seeing that we're seeing a very
sharp trendline so when's n finally
works its way into the mix we can expect
one of three things to happen with
respect to Intel the first is that Intel
finally lowers its CPU prices be very
skeptical of this one I am for sure
because if you look at something like a
44 60 that the processor is still gonna
put you back 170 or so US dollars and if
you compare that to a 6400 the skylake
counterpart that processor is about 180
bucks or thing at a $10 disparity from
generation to generation these
processors don't depreciate very well
and people
still buy them the second thing that
could happen is until radically changes
the architecture of either its mobile or
desktop CPU lineup in the future against
setting itself apart from AMD creating a
sort of barrier to competition and
ultimately not lowering its prices at
all and then there's the third thing
until continues to charge the exact same
price as it used to charge for its
future CPU generations that's actually
the one that I think will happen I don't
think Intel cares that AMD is finally
competing I think that they think a
majority of its consumer base will
remain a majority of its consumer base
that's bad news for AMD and that's
definitely bad news for us if you liked

dislike if you feel the complete
