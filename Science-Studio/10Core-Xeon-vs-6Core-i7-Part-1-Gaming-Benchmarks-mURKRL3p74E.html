sentence gaming and xiana there are very
very few exceptions see this video right
here for one of those I gamed on a 12:30
v5 but only because I can base clock
overclock if the one for that the lower
frequency of the Xeon processor just
really wouldn't have competed with an
overclockable I five or an overclockable
i7 but I have a ten core Xeon here now
that's ten cores that can be utilized in
games although most games won't take
advantage of all ten because they're not
optimized for all ten typically around
three or four is your sweet spot but the
core clock is so low on this chip that
it just eats into my framerate you're
going to see that in this video now of
course we're going to need something
with which to compare the Xeon as a sort
of baseline and in my last video I
benchmarked the sixty nine hundred K
against the 6700 case so I'm not going
to bother including both of those chips
because you have an idea kind of where
those stand with each other in regards
to just CPU intensive tasks in general
but I'm going to pit my 5820k that's the
CPU that's currently in Heisenberg
against this ten core giant and see how
much better or worse that six core 12th
each processor does when overclock to
four point five bigger it's compared to
this ten core processor with a
significantly lower clock speed let's
take a quick stab at the specifications
for our test bench this is my personal
race when sporting two gtx 1070 from
EVGA these are not super clocked ER for
the win
so I had to manually overclock them to
1800 megahertz they don't get much
harder than about 75 C at least the top
cord doesn't get much harder than 75 C
under full load I'm also sporting 32
gigabytes of Trident z ddr4 from g.skill
these come in a beautiful white and
silver array can get these configured
yourself beautiful memory modules the
motherboard I'm using it's an ex 99
Taichi from as rock and the CPU cooler
with which I use to cool both of these
CPUs even though the Xeon I mean I was
severe overkill for the Xeon is an ex 62
from NZXT this is a Kraken a io it's not
released yet but you can find its
specifications in this video's
description along with an update when it
is released of where you can buy it
one last thing we can overclock the i7 I
can't imagine why you would purchase a
5820k and not overclock it so ours is
overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz at 1.3
volts it doesn't get much hotter than
about 70 72 degrees Celsius under
so tonight is 64 after about 30 minutes
and for the xeon e5 2630 v4 well i tried
to base clock it as much as I could and
I got a whopping 50 megahertz of
additional boost out of it yeah that was
as far as I could go with that so at
least I need Star Trek right and also
because we're running a Xeon in that rig
with that configuration I could only
keep the ddr4 clock to 2133 megahertz
not 3200 + which the 5820k supports even
though the board supports it the CPU
itself won't allow the memory to run
that fast we're also not using ECC
memory with the Xeon because that really
wouldn't change any gaming result and
with that finally the moment you've all
been waiting for here are the gaming
benchmarks first up on our list is dying
light at 1440p and max settings our i7
5820k definitely won this round 130 FPS
on the average and 91 in the minimum
that's compared to 71 on the minimum for
the easy on 26:30 v4 it's a 20 FPS delta
and about the same as well for the
average framerate Dynalite is also a
very optimized game as i've proven in my
GP over CP bottlenecking video and
although the Xeon definitely has lower
single core performance thanks to its
much lower clock speed it does a decent
job at kind of staying in the game dying
light definitely doesn't take advantage
of all 10 of the Zeon's course
up next is city skylines in this game
for some reason only utilizes about
three cores the fourth core work and of
lingers in and out but every core after
that pretty much stays at around 5 to 10
percent CPU usage which reduced the
Zeon's advantage to nil so we have 44
FPS on the average for the i7 and 39 for
the Xeon not a big delta but for a game
like this it is definitely CPU bound I
do expect higher frame rates from both
of these chips being that this computer
cost about twenty-three hundred US
dollars cities also doesn't take
advantage of SLI verified here while GP
ones usage was around 70 to 80 percent
consistently the second GPU really
wasn't being used at all so that also
cut into a frame rate quite a bit third
up GTA 5 another game that I regard is
highly optimised and in 1440p we saw
about a hundred FPS on average for the
i7 but a mere 65 for the Xeon I was
actually playing online with some
friends yesterday and notice that this
yawns frame rate was significantly lower
than the i7 it actually caused me to
turn off my computer and swap from the
Seon back to the i7 for the sake of
gaining those additional 40 or so frames
now witcher 3 is a bit different in that
it's GPU bound even though we have two
gtx 1070 s in our rig so it really
didn't matter which cpu we were using in
this case 78 for the average on the i7
and 75 FPS for the xeon this GP
bottleneck was identified by both
graphics cards being utilized at near
100% during the entire benchmarking run
while our CPU usage remained well under
50% for a significant amount of gaming
time total war war hammers an example of
a DirectX 12 title in 1440p where the i7
pulled ahead by about 35 FPS on average
that is thanks to the i7 significantly
higher clock speed being the Total War
only utilizes to the max a single CPU
core you heard that correctly folks
total war stressing a single CPU core
and the Xeon fell far behind because his
clock speed is 1.5 gigahertz lower than
the i7 above it last up is battlefield
one many of you told me to benchmark in
conquest mode because that was so much
more CPU intensive than Team Deathmatch
I honestly didn't see much of a
difference at all between these two CPUs
in that regard even the i7 5820k pulled
out a 102 framerate average and the Xeon
not far behind 96 frames per second also
keep in mind here that our minimums were
literally within the margin of error so
what we've learned from these benchmarks
is that core account really doesn't mean
anything without the frequency to back
it up our i7 only had six cores it's
still a lot of cores that's much more
than the 6700 K and that processor would
give this one a run for its money but
even though we only had six cores
compared to the 10 on the Xeon
hyper-threading on both processors it
still managed to outperform the Xeon
every single scenario thanks to its
significantly higher clock speed it
might seem strange to some of you that
a10 core $700 CPU was annihilated by a
$350 hexa core processor but that's how
most games work these days developers
don't have the incentive to optimize
games for more than 4 cores because most
consumers only have 4 cores at their
disposal I like to use the console
analogy for this example picture a
PlayStation 4
it's sporting an APU Jaguar cores eight
of them although six or seven of them
depending on whether or not you unlock
that seventh core six or seven are
dedicated to specifically graphics and
one course dedicated to running the
media interface things of that sort but
that configuration for a PC would be
severely underpowered right you'd be
lucky to run some games in 720p at 60fps
1080p forget it most of the time you're
not even going to have an enjoyable
experience because you can have to drop
so many settings too low the games going
to look like trash but because games are
so well optimized for that specific
platform for the PlayStation 4 in
general they can boost the frame rate
and resolution because developers know
exactly what they're building and
designing the game for which means they
can take advantage of the hardware to
the max whereas PC game developers
pretty much have to keep an open mind
and code very generally around their
api's because not every person has the
exact same computer specifications with
