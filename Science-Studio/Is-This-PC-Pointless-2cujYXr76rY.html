where entire pcs can be fit into devices
not much larger than USB thumb drives
and connected to TVs and monitors via
the HDMI interface something that people
didn't even dream of 20 years ago
granted they are relatively weak and
lack expandability options but they're
as portable as USB thumb drives I show
case one in a video right here they're
clearly not for everyone but a niche
market of the frequent traveler type
just plug one into any TV or monitor and
voila you've got yourself a computer but
what about those looking for a very
compact standalone computer with plenty
of USB options HDMI out wired and
wireless LAN something like this it's
not very powerful at all but nonetheless
it is a computer it contains only 32
gigabytes of built-in storage a Windows
10 operating system that frequently
crashes and locks up and falls into the
same price category as this remember
this one folks
but alas let's give the byte plus from
Azul the benefit of the doubt is it
worth a 180 US dollars you tell me
let's start off with the design now
right away the device feels premium it
feels heavy it feels compact and just
well built in general honestly I can't
knock it here it's comprised of a
textured metallic roof and aluminum side
plating even the bottom of the PC feels
premium and sturdy it feels kind of
strange calling us a PC but that's
honestly what it is it sits firmly
upright thanks to its rubberized feet
weighs in at almost exactly two pounds
and a small enough to fit in the
tightest of spaces directly under a TV
for example I find the bite plusses
front power button to be very tasteful
so very minimalistic changes color based
on the status of the PC an excellent
tactile feedback the left side of the
device is bare while the right side
welcomes a single micro SD card slot
this is very important because as we'll
discuss shortly both variants of the
bite plus only shipped with 32 gigabytes
of built-in storage now the rear i/o was
honestly a pleasant surprise you'll find
both VGA and HDMI ports good for a dual
monitor setup although you might not
want to try this you'll see why later
two USB 3.0 is a single USB 2.0 and
internet portal Wi-Fi antenna whose
adapter supports both 2.4 and 5
gigahertz bands a single headphone jack
and a power input right away I suggest
plugging in some sort of wireless mouse
keyboard combo into the USB 2.0 port
allowing for both 3.0 ports to be used
for things like external drives as well
so far so good I was expecting nothing
less from you in terms of both build
quality and accessibility good job there
but let's move on to performance what
should you expect from a computer this
size obviously compromises had to be
made right well depending on the model
you purchased you're looking at anywhere
from 2 to 4 gigabytes of ddr3 L 32
gigabytes of internal storage as
mentioned earlier in an Intel cherry
trail Z 8300 quad-core processor running
in a mere 1.4 gigahertz which will
temporarily burst up to 1.8 gigahertz
under heavy load it's a very efficient
ship consuming only a few watts of power
under load similar to laptop chips hence
the compact charger that ships with it
and as such boasts no fan of any kind
meaning this is a silent PC it still
gets hot according to i-264 around 60
degrees Celsius when fully stressed but
it's not like you'd hear anything and
the aluminum chassis does an excellent
job passively cooling the system the Z
8300 only scores
even 100 CB and Cinebench definitely
subpar but an improvement over the Intel
bay trail lineup nonetheless Geekbench
was a similar story marginally higher
single core performance yielding an
overall more powerful system by all
accounts but again not by much and if
you intend to use your PC where you
wouldn't ordinarily have a TV or monitor
at your disposal a cheap until atom
laptop will be better suited for you in
terms of overall responsiveness this is
where the byte plus begins to fall a bit
short the entire system just feels
bogged down and just slow overall even
boot times drift toward disk drive
territory and opening single programs or
even the Start menu for that matter
involves a degree of latency what I
believe to be the fault of both the
processor and lack of available RAM this
model I have here is the 2 gigabyte
variant I don't know why as well sent me
the 2gig variant but so be it directly
in line with my Intel Atom laptop
nonetheless and this one here is
available for around 170 US dollars oh
and something else I feel I should
mention here especially for a lot of you
who are interested in purchasing this
for something like lightweight gaming
don't try it not not even lightweight
gaming is suited for this device as all
made it very clear to me in our emails
back and forth that this device was not
intended for gaming and I see why
minecraft hovered around 30 FPS on low
settings and only 12 chunks rendered and
literally became unplayable once I
started recording with fraps something I
did not experience with the IdeaPad 100
s strange because the Intel Atom
processor supported in that laptop is
actually a fair bit weaker than this one
is this goes without saying even though
this is a true quad core CPU
multitasking options are limited thanks
to weak individual core performance we
saw that in the Geekbench scores so to
wrap this one up what I purchased this
myself for any reason whatsoever like
even if I put myself in someone's shoes
like I've traveled every week and you
know I need something on the go what I
buy this no I would not and here's why I
cannot think of for the life of me a
scenario in which I would rather have
this than that and this goes back to
what I said earlier in regards to TV and
monitor availability if you purchased
something like this because it's a
lightweight and portable then why would
you not purchase a laptop don't they
both fit the same description it's like
having a screen included at no
additional cost from this point of view
I
challenged you in the comments below to
list scenarios in which having something
like this would be more beneficial than
just having a laptop that is in the same
price category and the same performance
category for that matter honestly I
cannot think of a single one sure it
gets the job done
at an affordable price but I'm gonna
need some kind of display in order to
use it whereas a laptop has everything
you could possibly need and is arguably
just as if not more portable so Azul I
understand the whole race to build the
most compact PC thing I get it people
are constantly on the move and looking
for things that are more and more
convenient to carry around with them
it's why I TX PCs are catching the
interests of more and more consumers the
Azul PC stick is a great product because
it's something you can throw into your
pocket or nonno cup holder but this this
form factor destroys any competitive
advantage it has over a similarly priced
laptop that wouldn't be far off in the
performance Department either does that
make sense
if I want ultra ultra Portability and
discreteness I would just purchase the
Azul PC stick it's linked by the way in
this video's description I think it's a
great product I reviewed it earlier I
actually use it it's plugged into the
back of my TV in the living room it even
has a wired LAN support if your Wi-Fi
isn't pulling through but if you're just
looking for ease of use and convenience
a laptop in my opinion is the way to go
this is the awkward middleman and given
the specs doesn't compel me to purchase
it over something like this
which conveniently comes with a screen
camera a full sized keyboard you get the
point
maybe Azul should be considering laptops
for this particular price bracket
nonetheless if you're still interested
in the byte Plus here you can find its
link as well in this video's description
if you liked this video and/or
appreciate my rather brutal honesty when
it comes to products like this be sure
to give this one a thumbs up thumbs down
if you do feel the complete opposite or
if you hate everything about life be
sure to click Subscribe if how to write
stay tuned for more content like this I
also a few interesting computer related
builds headed your way well no one's a
build and once an upgrade rather so
Walter White I'll be upgrading to
version 2.0 that's all I want to say
about that follow me on Twitter for more
info and then I'm also going to be
building a relatively cheap PC out of
100% used parts I think I'm gonna stick
with eBay and just build something for
around 300 bucks called a console killer
piece um let you guys Duke it out in the
comments
this is science studio thanks for
learning with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
