series looking pretty hot and promptly
stole the show at Computex this year
video viewership is a firm testament
those videos were getting hundreds of
thousands of views and everything else
seemed to not do as well and while it's
good to be back home there's still
plenty to discuss
and I plan to pack much of it into this
video alright so firstly I'd like to
touch on the chipset compatibility again
we outline much of it in this video
right here but one thing I didn't
mention was a lack of original Zen
support on the new x5 70 chips if that
means running a one series Rison chip
with an x5 70 motherboard it was clearly
depicted in the chart AMD sent to us but
I didn't bother touching on it because I
expected it to be a rather niche
combination to begin with why would you
upgrade your motherboard and not upgrade
your CPU but after posting my TL DR pin
command a few of you expressed serious
to staying with this revelation and to
an extent I can understand I mean AMD
promised us platform support through
2020 right but I think this was meant to
be taken the other way around and a lot
of you assumed it this way socket
support for new CPUs through 2020 not
motherboards support for old chips
through 2020 and with a few exceptions
this is what we're seeing right both x4
70 B 450 motherboard supports Zen to
either natively or the BIOS update and
motherboard manufacturers like gigabyte
and MSI have pledged at least a few of
their higher-end boards will support the
new chips as well so for obvious reasons
a320 isn't included here although I
highly doubt anyone bought into that
chipset expecting a future-proof
platform the power delivery on that
board or any of those a320 boards for
that matter just not gonna hold out
especially to the 12th core variant that
AMD will be selling soon anyway case in
point
AMD promised platform or socket support
through 2020 and it would only make
sense to think this in the way we just
discussed upgrading CPUs and keeping the
same motherboard it's much easier to
swap CPU than to swap a motherboard and
you'll see real gains with a CPU swap
all the major perks by the way you'll
still have generally excellent overclock
you support with
x4 or v4 and a more compliant XMP what
you won't have though and what I want to
confirm to you guys who's AMD directly
referenced this in the meeting we had
them is PCI agent for support on
anything pre x5 70 this flies in the
face of many reports that vendors like
gigabyte would be activating it more or
less in some other higher-end products
that had the trace support and indeed
this was their their plan they were
trying to be good guys but I am B thinks
this will be too confusing for the
general consumer you might be fooled
into thinking his or her board sports
you know PCI 4 supports it natively in
my opinion this kind of sucks and the
ration has a bit flawed right how is
this any different than SLI or crossfire
you'll only know the board includes
support for either of those if it's
printed on the box or in the manual or
on the accompanying website this
shouldn't be a reason the shaft
motherboard manufacturers who were
diligent enough to future-proof some
other higher-end products that's that's
my take in light of everything good I
think Amy's done lately this just isn't
one of them in my book but what is good
is the pricing structure the ami rise in
530 600 it comes in at a cool $1.99 it's
six cores and twelve threads and if we
assume a 15% IPC improvement as AMD
claims then we're getting just that
about a 15% bump for no change in price
between generations
this isn't biblical but it's a great
lead for AMD if current prices remain
fixed for the next few months you'll
have a tough choice between the rise of
526 hundred at 150 u.s. or less which is
a really good deal and the rise of 536
hundred at 199 a few rumors had this
chip at eight course which would have
made it an incredible value at this
price but as is I'd say it's just it's
just decent horizon 730 700 X is the
next chip I'd like to discuss 16 threads
for just over 300 bucks is pretty
awesome especially considering how
expensive intel's 9900 k has been as of
late and with IPC jumps like these i'd
say until better brace for impact
i don't expect these 7-series chips to
crush blue team offerings by any means
especially with respect to gaming but i
do expect them to come awfully close and
that's good enough for me a cheaper
equally viable alternative is all I'm
looking for and that's nice and a bonus
and only 65 watts this chip should stay
comfortably cool while boosting to well
over 4 gigahertz all that of course is
going to go out the window if you choose
to manually overclock this is an X
variant which is kind of weird for a 65
watt TDP chip but yep
you're gonna consume significant more
power than 65 watts especially when you
overclock and I expect that that power
draw will be again slightly higher
anyway TDP is not an occasion of power
draw but it's a good reference point
you're gonna consume more power from the
wall to pull more power from that wall
then the 65 watt rating just FYI horizon
9 3900 X is the monster 12 core 24
thread 105 Wahb behemoth we've been
waiting for almost it's certainly no
consumer grade 16 courtroom went across
the web although I expect won't come
soon but 12 cores should be plenty for
the vast majority of gamers and creators
in the consumer space which begs the
question what's gonna happen a thread
ripper after all this maybe that in a
separate video $4.99 seems like a pretty
steep ask for 12 cores in 2019
especially with you know 8 cores
becoming extremely cheap right that's
1700 or 1700 X is like well below 200
bucks now granted it's first generation
but still that's 8 cores and a consumer
grade platform on the cheap I'm actually
way cheaper than I ever thought those
chips would get new and that's going to
impose a tough choice for a lot of
people looking to build it for a system
especially you wanna stay on a budget
should you buy a cheaper older 8 core or
a brand new 6 core and yeah $4.99 is a
lot of money but you won't see me
complaining regards to the 12th core
variant why because consumer boards are
cheap relatively speaking
AMD assured us that these chips could
run overclocked and even be 450 boards
that means assuming you've picked a
decent board with decent power delivery
you'll only need to spend around 600
bucks for the CPU and motherboard attack
another 100 bucks for 16 gigs of ram and
you've got a platform that a surely last
three or four years before its age
begins to show likely longer on the tr4
platform you'll spend around 350 for a
1920 X that's first gen thread Ripper
it's 12 cores 24 threads right but
several hundred dollars on a thread
Ripper motherboard this offsets the
price difference between the chips alone
it means that assuming you off for the
1920 X you'll be paying around the same
price for a chip that performs around 15
to 20 percent worse per core and I'm
just not about that game it's also
ignores latency issues associated with
tier 4 as well and that ladies and
gentlemen is my price justification for
the third a 900 X so
there you go I couldn't really do this
context because I didn't have to I
didn't have enough time to just sit down
and crunch all the numbers but there you
go so if we assume similar gaming
performances in between like current
coffee like offerings and upcoming Zen
two or four core then what about content
creators this one's going to be largely
dependent on the software suite you use
for obvious reasons but in the case of
premiere which is rather popular it's
one I've used for a long time you'll
likely want an Intel chip still it may
sound super silly at first but hear me
out
Rises Achilles heel and I've been saying
this from the beginning with respect to
content creators has been its lack of an
IGP and hardware accelerated tasks like
video encoding and scrubbing Intel will
almost certainly perform better core for
core and that's because it isn't just
the cores at work in the case of
mainstream Intel offerings HD graphics
helps significantly as seen in this
workstation render so it's very likely
even the 9700 K will outpace the 3100
acts and hardware accelerated video
editing and rendering workloads I'm not
being paid to say that in fact I kind of
hope that I'm proven wrong in this
regard I mean I feel stupid even even
say this in a video that neither AMD nor
Intel pay my bills and in video I'm
lucky to even get samples from them and
yes you could argue that software
optimization has a lot to do with this
especially in the case of premiere it
definitely runs smoother on my Intel
machines I can attest to that firsthand
but it's the reality I confront on a
daily basis right so in my case I kind
of have to conform time will tell again
I hope I'm wrong I I mean at least kind
of hope I'm wrong but I'm fairly certain
that I'm not going to be and look to be
honest most of you could care less about
an AI GP right if you're gonna be gaming
an IG P is virtually worthless it won't
transform a gaming experience we've got
discrete cards for those kinds of things
speaking of gaming one final thing I'd
like to address is core account
viability for the average game where we
touched on this in my initial rise in
coverage at Computex this year
anyone who purely games should avoid the
3900 X instead the sweet spot is looking
like the 3700 X now you might want to
3900 X for something a little more than
gaming maybe just streaming and gaming
at the same time although I have my
doubts about whether or not that is
and viable for a lot of you because you
can get you can get so much done even
streaming and gaming at the same time on
an eight-core 16 thread ship so my
opinion the sweet spot is that 3700 x4
go the former save 200 USD in the
process throw it into a much better
graphics card you'll get way better
frame rates and games the difference
between an RT X 2070 and a 2080 is
pretty substantial in the difference
between an RX 5:18 and RT x 2070 is
equally so you'll see huge gains and
your frame rate compared to tiny ones
you'll see between the 37 and 3900 X
that's assuming you see any difference
at all
clock for clock and going off of
experience with Zanon Zen plus here I
mean I think that's a fair assessment
I've tired of the risin 5 sixteen
hundred and twenty six hundred as the
best all-around value chips of 2017 and
2018 you've been streaming games
seamlessly and the frame rate
differences between them and something
like an i-5 maybe 400 usually aren't
distinguishable by the human eye we're
talking maybe 80 fps verse 85 you get
the point the 3900 X has geared morphs
forward heavy multitaskers for obvious
reasons so folks do a lot of compiling
scripting programming work with VMs
right those are the people who were
truly stress 24 threats maybe more than
that and the 3900 X in those cases might
not even be good enough for you the
games though that you'll be playing
won't do that I don't know a single game
in existence that will fully saturate 24
threads even 16 is difficult tasks for
modern triple-a titles I'm only trying
to save you money here so it just seems
like the you know having the biggest and
baddest of them all is is such like a
it's just such a social trend now but
when you don't need that much horsepower
it is in my opinion just a waste of
money spend the extra money saved on a
better graphics card and I think a cores
will do you a solid for several years
again at least three or four in my book
so that's that for this one that you can
find a few solid articles reference down
