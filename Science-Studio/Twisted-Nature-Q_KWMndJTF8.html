synonymously envision the devastation
that follows after all with wind speeds
approaching 300 miles per hour and
vortex diameters of over two miles it
seems like the natural thing to do they
can level entire towns toss cars ten
miles away and even rip up the
foundations of concrete buildings but
the natural phenomenon though as
infrequent as they may appear to be are
not unique to earth consider this
pulling up a plug from the tub of water
creates a vortex but now while it makes
sense for the water to move downward
what causes the rotation ultimately the
billions and billions of water molecules
that are being pulled toward a very
small opening become repulsed by well
billions of other water molecules they
bounce off of each other as they attempt
to cram themselves into a tighter space
as a result the water utilizes a vortex
to reduce the amount of intermolecular
friction and more importantly increase
the total travel time between the water
at the surface of the tub and the plug
at the base of it you can try this at
home yourself at first lifting up the
plug won't do much of anything to the
water at the surface yet over time
disturbances at the surface will
eventually yield this spiraling tornado
effect the point of this analogy is
similar behaviors can be experienced in
gases aka atmospheres of planets when
water evaporates it must absorb heat
this is what allows each individual
water molecule to break its polar bonds
with the surrounding water molecules
think about what it takes to boil a pot
of water water has a very high heat
capacity meaning that it requires a
relatively large amount of energy in
order to increase its relative
temperature by just one degree now let's
envision this process taking place in
the opposite direction when water
condenses that is changes from a boiling
stage to a liquid state it must release
a large amount of heat rather than
absorb a large amount of heat when this
happens in a supercell a cloud that has
a considerably high altitude typically a
cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud cold air
can do the same but move downward toward
the surface so you can kind of see
things play out here the hot air is less
dense than the moisture and cold air in
clouds when the cold air and moisture
are forced downward fast
this can pull those clouds with it and
form a vortex the vortex becomes a
tornado once it finally touches the
ground so this whole process can also be
said of dust devils which are just
basically tornadoes minus the moisture
so at first a dust devil on Mars doesn't
seem all that strange I mean Mars is
mostly a desert right but when you
consider this the fact that Mars has
almost no atmosphere all things get a
little strange in fact our own moon
would rival Mars for who has the denser
atmosphere scientists at NASA say that
if you were an astronaut on the surface
of Mars and experienced a dust devil up
close you wouldn't feel much wind but
you would certainly feel the rocks and
sand and other large debris that would
be carried along with the dust devil
itself so where else in the solar system
do you envision tornadoes and dust
devils forming certainly not a planet
like mercury right a place like Venus
seems to be a good candidate it has
clouds it has an atmosphere it has high
winds but it's a very very harsh and
cruel place just watch this video to
learn more about that does Jupiter's
Great Red Spot count as a tornado or is
that more of a hurricane I mean what's
really the difference between the two
others in fact that one's really big and
one's pretty small and compact Neptune
is dark spot maybe Saturn's hexagonal
vortexes at its pulse there are several
candidates to choose from just an our
solar system alone and maybe someday
we'll be able to narrow those results
this is science studio thanks for
learning with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
