the video description so I 5s are
definitely different than I 7 obviously
and are fives are definitely different
than our 7s but it doesn't just stop
there
277 hundred KS could still be radically
different from other standpoints this
also extends to GPUs so what does
binning mean and what is the silicon
lottery this is our minute science
playlist and yes this is gonna take
longer than a minute to finish when
risin 7 launched the hype was real and
although they were never really true
gaming CPUs as in most games won't come
anywhere close to fully leveraging 16
threads they offered a unique value
proposition to those previously
considering only i7s and Zeon's but AMD
not only brought octa core CPUs to the
mainstream they did the same thing with
hexa core CPUs in the 1600 1600 X which
are priced comparably to intel's I 5
CPUs what many aren't aware of though is
the fact that risin 5 CPUs use the exact
same die as Rison 7 counterparts meaning
that if you were to disable sequential
cores and opposing CC X's you could have
a risin 5 CPU from Horizon 7 CPU that
means similar IPC similar overclocked
ability and similar power drop per core
with respect to TDP thresholds so AMD's
disabling cores and risin 5 and rising 3
CPUs but why not to save money of course
but from an architectural perspective
they're doing this because some cores
aren't passing the mark think of this as
a sort of inspection if a single die
with 2 CC axes has six cores pass with
flying colors and two that don't then
the die will likely be thrown into the
16 Series pile from here the degree of
metal vapor deposition and current
leakage among other things will be used
to further determine whether or not the
die becomes arisin 5 1600 or 1600 X
lithography with better overall
structure will appropriately handle
larger power draws so those will become
1600 X's with higher TDP s-- this is the
bidding process of every CPU GPU
manufacturer on the planet does this to
some degree but what about our previous
example with 277 hundred KS why can one
overclock above 5 gigahertz with ease
and
low voltage and one barely touched 4.8
gigahertz and get extremely hot this is
where the Silicon Lottery earns its name
and four CPUs it applies when they're
unlocked if you buy a 7700 K from an
online vendor like Amazon or new egg
your guess is as good as mine regarding
overclock ability and resulting V core
requirements this has to do with the
very tiny imperfections within each die
not all connections between transistors
and caches memory are up to par
resulting in varying degrees of latency
and power loss in the form of heat if
the inefficiency of a single core or
complex is great enough then it will be
quarantined and effectively disabled
within the die but if latency is minimal
it will be left intact and Silicon
Lottery takes effect it answers the
question how high can I overclock my CPU
with said voltage now no two CPUs are
alike so if you want to get really fine
into detail which no you if I would ever
let you do you could eventually narrow
down each specific voltage for every CPU
ever designed on the planet that means
that every CPU will have a certain
voltage at which it could reach a
frequency and remain relatively stable
this is typically regarded as binning
when you hear it use it's referencing
the silicon's degree of perfection until
an AMD already do this by unlocking
certain skews and disabling cores but
graphics card manufacturers run the same
analysis consider three EVGA graphics
cards a GT X 1080 a6 3.0 a GTX 1080
super clock and in GTX 1084 the win the
face a CX card has a boost clock of
seventeen hundred and thirty three
megahertz while the SC and for the
windows 1847 in 1860 respectively by
nature of how ebj bends its cards
certain boards are grouped into any of
these categories the ones that can clock
higher are costlier as a result you're
essentially paying for a better bin it's
under the radar but it's actually pretty
cool so if you want a car that can run
stable at a higher frequency got to pay
a little more for it kind of like
capitalism on a small scale it's the
same thing you do when you choose to
forego a 7700 in favor of a 7700 K the
7700 K has a higher bin than the 7700 so
if both chips were unlocked
we should expect the k-series skew to
overclock a bit higher as a bonus here
you can actually pay a premium for CPUs
that are prebend silicon lottery comm
you'll pay a premium sure but the
overclocked sassette voltages and
settings are guaranteed according to
