studio and yes this thing is kind of in
the camera while you're facing this way
you usually face over from over there
you're facing that way but the cameras a
little different because the video is
going to be a little different but this
is the blue Yeti microphone that I
reviewed a few videos ago I do have that
hooked up currently to a knee where I
guess is how you say it a microphone
stand and then I have a pop filter in
front of that so that's what's that's
what you're listening to currently and I
will be using this from now on of course
you won't be seeing this in most cases
the video camera will be over there and
I will make sure this is a bit higher
and the gain I'll turn up a bit more so
that the sound is still fairly clear but
with that being said this video is a bit
different a lot of you have complimented
me in regards to my video editing
qualities and you know how things look
very professional when I upload them you
know being that we only just started out
three months ago and I really don't have
much to my disposal really just this is
really all it in the studio and I
appreciate this compliment I do want to
pay tribute to those comments that I've
received by showing you how I edit
videos so let's go ahead and get started
so the first thing I want to point out
here is the fact that I will be using
shadow play Nvidia shadowplay to record
all of this going on it does use a bit
of CPU horsepower but not too much you
do notice it takes forever to load
because I have cpuid installed on my
hard disk drive and on my cell estate
drive but you can see here that my
temperatures are relatively stable and
while shadow play is running in the
background we're getting around 10 to
15% CPU usage among all four cores on
this 6600 K so I want you to keep that
in mind
while we go through this entire tutorial
the video editing software that I use if
you didn't already know beforehand is
Adobe Premiere I highly recommend Adobe
Premiere I do what I wanted to say
though about Nvidia shadowplay the fact
that this is going to be recording in 21
by 9 so this is my LG ultrawide monitor
the problem with that is most of you
only have 1080p monitors or at least
monitors in the 16 by 9 aspect ratio so
what I'm going to do is
basically cut off the entire right side
of this video from now on I'm gonna try
to edit everything over on the left side
of the screen so if things are cut off
or you know something doesn't look right
it's because I'm cropping this to just
sixteen by nine for the sake of most of
your I guess video sources so with that
being said I we can go ahead and start a
new project and we can name this project
SC ST and then I always select capture
format HDV and just that just make sure
make sure videos look a little bit
better go ahead and click OK and then
it's gonna throw us into okay this is
what I was talking about here I'm gonna
drag this I hope that's about 1080p it
looks about right guys right here this
is the blank canvas this is where the
magic happens ladies and gentlemen and
this right here is pretty much where
everything goes down here in the studio
all in this application right here so we
have Adobe Premiere Pro and first thing
that I like to do I'm gonna slide this
over just a little bit someone get this
science - to your folder here first
thing I like to do is drag in well most
of my my stock footage I don't have much
currently because I don't have the space
for at all just to be stored I don't
have an ass or anything like that so
most of my data is you know upload and
then dump I dump all the data that I
previously use just because the videos
are already on YouTube and I'm not
really concerned with keeping a lot of
my footage so what I'll go ahead and do
is throw in a little bit of a mix of
Clips here these are from the original
skylake PC bill the RGB ville they will
build we're gonna throw in let's throw
in two or three these clips somewhere
I'm very quick at all this is a clip of
the screen for some reason okay so yeah
so now we have basically our core clips
and you can see right now it's streaming
in full now if your CPU is not very
powerful
I recommend dropping that to half or a
quarter what that's going to do is
basically reduce the resolution of the
image as it plays so you can see right
now it's actually playing at 480p for a
denote 540 piece excuse me it's playing
at 540 P right now and then if we drop
that again to 1/4 it's gonna play it
whatever 1/4 of 1080p is when you drop
this resolution down here you're gonna
save yourself a lot of trouble if you're
using
an especially weak processor no offense
there you know that's just if you have a
weaker processes what you got to do
I usually stream in half but for the
sake of this video I want you guys to
see everything in full detail I'm gonna
stream it at full CP you should be able
to handle it one way to test how strong
your CPU is is just scrub do something
like this here if you're getting a lot
of like lag and delay well that means
that your CPU is having a very difficult
time keeping up with what the heck
you're doing here in the application so
you can give it a test or to try it out
now if I drop it to one half things are
gonna be much more responsive of course
because the CPU is only rendering
effectively half the video quality and I
have to have the detail so I'm gonna go
back to full now I have these clips here
right and they're usually they're
usually accompanied by an audio set but
this audio set is from that's well it's
from my camera it's the the shotgun
mounted a microphone atop my nikon d50
100 so this is kind of like my backup
now because i have the blue yeti
microphone currently but in most cases i
will just use the stock audio or I will
use audio that I have made myself
through audacity now you can see here I
am currently recording what I'm doing
so audacity I would use to record my
audio footage and then I would that I
would save this so I'll go up here and I
would hit export audio I would export it
as a dot WAV document which is a very
high bitrate document music file and
then I will drag that over here into
Adobe Premiere under a two and then once
it's over in a two I will basically
synchronize everything so you have to
align all the different voices but I
keep a one here so that I know where to
start that way I hear an echo and as
long as it's a pure echo that means that
I've overlapped the audio successfully
then I can just mute this audio and then
later on towards the end of the editing
process I will delete this line
altogether of course by locking this one
first that I don't delete that and then
yeah bring that over so that's what
would happen if I had audio audio
footage I was gonna say but if I had an
audio file that I would overlay here if
I was
just you know talking if it was
narration voiceovers effectively now but
I don't have that so what we're gonna do
is just put some music over it but
that's really beside the point of this
current point in time so uh my
transitions my effects here I really
don't do editing editing very much I
just there's I just stay in effects cuz
it's pretty much all like I like to do
um we can have it I fade in from black
over here no it's gonna just fade in
yeah very nice and pretty
I should probably that way you can see
so this is this is how long the
transition will take place you can of
course extend this and it will take much
longer for that transition to elapse you
can see it's slowly fading in from black
so you can do that and then we have
other transitions over here between
stock footage so okay this is this is
what it'll say when you don't have
enough media in between clips to fade
that's not a problem though it's gonna
say the same thing it's just gonna
manually do it itself you can see here
it's gonna bake it on over and then
don't do the same thing over here
hey you don't over there we go nice
cameras all Rocky usually I would just
edit that stuff out all right so let's
go ahead and do that right here we have
my pretty still clips so what I'll do is
take the trim tool and I'll trim it of
course we're gonna lose that fade to
black transition but that's not a big
deal go ahead and put another one in
there okay get a lot closer you can see
that okay so it's gonna fade in from
black and it's gonna be pretty still and
of course at this point I would be
talking about the computer blah blah
blah blah and then at some point I'm
gonna cut it so I'm gonna pause it and
I'm gonna slice it and then I'm going to
determine what's good so this is a still
shot too so we'll stop it right here
then we're gonna right click and ripple
delete all that good stuff actually not
good stuff at all and then now we have
another still shot still film of
computer fans turning and we'll stop it
right here don't need too much actually
start to wobble at me in there and we'll
scrub it a bit to the left
okay trim that let's check to see if we
got anything else over here it's worth
include
now one's nice but I want the one with a
graphics card where's that at
there we go okay right there delete all
this good stuff when you hit ripple
delete by the way it's gonna pull
everything into the area that you just
deleted that's quite nice and up to
right there it's pretty good now we're
to delete this remaining clip I'm gonna
throw that cross-dissolve back in okay
now you can see that once we hit play
we're going to have a very smooth
well not smooth but it's just gonna
split between clips it'll look much more
professional than it did when we just
were editing the raw footage so the end
result is much cleaner and looks much
more professional and of course you
wanted to add cross dissolves there you
could do that I like to use cross
dissolve so you could all see use film
dissolves either one my personal opinion
they look great so I'll just mix it up
really one cross from one fade this is
the original clip look at that fade yeah
look at that
pretty nice huh and then the film
dissolve I believe it's the second one
look they look almost the same in film
dissolve actually looked a little better
in my opinion the crosses off but yeah
it's it's just up to you so yeah that's
that you'll have another fade it's a
little rocky we're gonna cut that out
okay no no we're gonna have this one's
what's the pull out so we're gonna have
that edited crop that out and then we're
gonna slice this back in let's see oh
yeah look at that not the smoothest fade
away but it'll do
now that screen is rocky so we're gonna
say yeah that's good okay that film is
all back over there so it's gonna fade
from here and yeah yeah the computer
shut down I guess this is a clip of the
computer shutting down how interesting
okay so let's assume that what we have
currently is is what we're satisfied
with this is what we want to put this is
the bulk footage of what we want in our
upload and our Youtube upload so with
that being said what I like to do next
is typically I'll hop into our
in studio folder and I will import some
music now this music is uh this is the
more recent music I've been using in
most of my videos beat your competition
is the name of this this song here that
I pulled off of the YouTube library I'm
gonna edit it on at it I'm gonna crop it
right here you'll see why it's second
I'm gonna go ahead and delete the rest
of that then I'm gonna come up here to
my audio effects but audio transitions
crossfade constant power this is gonna
let our audio fade in and out okay and
then I'm gonna slice it right there
again and I'm gonna do another
transition you'll see why again in a
second so what I like to set my audio to
is about it's not gonna let me do it
right here all I can just do this
manually about 31 about right and then
it's gonna of course transition up so
this is basically going to time up so
once we end once our last piece of
footage ends it's going to increase an
audio volume just by the way we set it
up there are other ways to do this this
is just the way I do it and then we're
going to pull all of this over we're
gonna make room for something special
and that is our science studio intro
this is the intro that I've been
throwing into all of the most recent
videos of mine on the channel you're
open Dilys we can pull out all back
together and then let's go ahead and
give it a listen shall we yeah not bad
huh
yeah so that's that
not too shabby eh and if you want this
to fade longer we can just stretch that
out just like you would with any other
transition up here or effect I guess is
what they're called so you can make that
last longer so that fade out will take
longer yeah so much more steady fade in
that case not too bad so with that on in
mind and all being said we're going to
do one final thing and that's create an
ending title I don't like to do anything
very complicated at this point because
to be honest most of you probably don't
even watch the videos all the way
through you probably just stopped
recording or something like that so all
I put here is just an sc/st and center
it up I always use the same font preset
it is case you're wondering one second
here it's not technically center because
this box goes down a bit further a
little higher okay right there yep so
that's good now but the font preset I
use is this one right here
poplar black poplar sometimes it's
Rosewood black but whichever one's
usually it's the first one it looked
almost identical I really don't know why
they're two different font types but
yeah that's the one I always use that's
the one I use for my title Clips my
little title thumbnails for the videos
and also what I tend to use most of the
time within videos if I have access to
Adobe Premiere and then once that title
is created we hop on over here to our
project and we'll find our title and
we'll go ahead and drag it let make it
stretch the length of our ending little
split here and then we'll do a nice and
steady dip to black right there and then
another dip to black towards the end
let's stretch that one out a bit more so
it's not too quick yeah we'll go ahead
and do it for this one too so there we
go
now our ending credits
all right so that's all said and done
okay now the last thing I like to do is
start doing some image overlays on top
of our source video footage so let's say
we want to throw in a graphics card into
the video itself let's go and type in
graphics card now be careful here some
of these pictures will be copyrighted or
you know you'll run into some problems
with ownership rights all that good
stuff so be careful what you put on
YouTube videos and whatnot
okay okay so we have this one right here
this is an ASIS what is this Poseidon
gtx 780 so that's republic of gamers
very nice one this isn't the newest but
it'll do let's save this into our so we
have science studio folder and we have
picture folder
sub folding throw that into there pull
up our full nerves okay so it's right
there now this is what I like to do with
these photos because I don't like the
white backgrounds and on top of that
most of them aren't in the sixteen by
nine format so I will open this with
paint.net if you don't know about paint
on it and go ahead and check them out a
very safe user-friendly painting
application select this magic wand tool
here and click that white background go
ahead and hit the delete button on your
keyboard and then take out any of those
extra white spaces that may have
lingered around and processed here over
there sneaky thing that and that seems
to be at that little section right there
I'm not gonna worry about that's too
particular okay so we have that now if
you have deleted a background from an
image and it's so it's basically not a
square or a rectangle what you're gonna
have to do is save as and then you're
going to want to change your save type
to PNG if you save it as a jpg your
background will remain white not blank
as a PNG file the background will be
removed and all you will see and
whatever source whatever application you
inject this image into will be the
graphics card with no background at all
and that's exactly what I like to do
with with Adobe Premiere so this image
right here this is the original jpg file
you know hey
and delete that don't need that anymore
and we're gonna drag this image to the
v2 which is one step above our base
value and you can see boom there it is
now this image is way too big takes up
too much space and ultimately has
nothing to do with this video but that's
ok because we're going to shrink this
graphics card by using the scale tool
under the video effects control tab we
can shrink it check it out we can rotate
it yeah we can slide it up and down left
and right you can actually do this with
the clicking - why I don't like using
that though I like using these tools
over here and then uh let's see we'll
just roll rotate it
that looks pitiful let's do it like that
yeah okay I'll have it right there and
then we're gonna put it over in the
corner okay
and now pay attention to this bar right
here this is going to tell the program
how long to show this image so if we
just played it with where it is right
now
right it's gonna pop up and then
disappear now the cool thing is you can
actually take these effects overlays and
you can apply these to second third and
whatever tier the video footage you
would like to add into your into your
final product so we'll just do a film
well that's not just on let's do a
crosses off crosses all fading in and
then let's slide it further back so we
can extend a little bit and then crossed
is all fading out now at this point
look at that and that pretty cool and
then the last thing you could do in this
case is go up here to the titles tab
it's like new title default still just
like we did with the with the ending
title and then go down here and select
the science to do approved poplar font
and then let's type in gtx 780 okay
we're gonna want to scale that way up so
people can see it cuz that's a really
nice graphics card we're gonna put it
right there okay
I'm gonna drag it on top of the two
video clip so it's right on top v2 and
we're gonna do the same fading cross
dissolve in and out we're not going to
bother changing the lengths of those
effects and here's the final product
yeah not bad if you want to extend it
boom
use that boom is is that they're gonna
still be synchronous isn't that cool
okay so let's go ahead and watch the
final product and also remember to save
everything that you do after every big
step I recommend come up here and hit
English Save
Adobe will Auto Save as you just saw but
it's it's periodic you can change that
when it when it saves but you know if
you have it save every 15 minutes or so
you'll be okay
these projects usually take me about an
hour to two hours to edit and upload
YouTube so that's pretty much everything
of course there's much more there's much
more footage and there's there's an
extra layer of audio that goes into the
actual videos that I'll upload
especially this one this one's gonna
have a few overlays but that's pretty
much it now let's go ahead and watch the
thing all the way through once more so
you can see I don't know the end result
of what we've just done here
exciting right that's a video that's a
science studio video in a nutshell
that's how I edit so appreciate the
compliments thank you for letting me
know that you think I've done a good job
I hope to only improve with my Adobe
Premiere Pro skill so if you have any
tips for me in particular go ahead and
let me know in the comments below one
more thing before I go though however I
want to show you the presets that I use
to export my media so I go into the
media tab and the format's you know
default h.264 maybe for me it may not be
for you but I recommend h.264 click on
that thing and then drag yourself down
here to well you might not want to do
this I do it just because YouTube's
gonna compress the crap out of whatever
video you upload regardless so I just
choose the YouTube 1080p HD preset now
you can change things like your frame
rate if you want just hit the you know
hit this little checkmark here and then
you can drag it to 60fps say if you have
a 60fps 60p camera but I just say it
29.97 effective because I have a 30 30 P
camera so that's what that stays that if
you have 4k whatever of course it would
you would just select the 4k preset or
whatever resolution video you have in
your workflow I always select to use
maximum render quality because it makes
your pictures look a bit crisper render
at maximum depth for the same reason I
don't touch audio or any of this other
stuff this is just extra stuff if you
want to get fancy you could change the
overall look of your video if you want
changing these lumetri looks and whatnot
I don't touch any of that cuz it's not
really what I'm about and then I click
export and the computer does it doesn't
jazz so depending on your cpu horsepower
however powerful your CPU is this could
take anywhere from a minute for a one
minute video file to 10 minutes for a 5
minute video file at various course
depending on a lot of things but your
CPUs the the primary determiner
determiner God why do I keep okay you
know what I mean your CPU is is gonna
determine this this length of time
mostly you see mine was I don't know how
long the video was it was 52 seconds and
has taken about 35 seconds to to rent
that's not too bad for us for core i5
and then once the video is officially
rendered and whatnot
I really picked up speed very quickly I
could hide an exit out here and all of
my Adobe files save to to my Adobe
folder so I'll go over to YouTube and
then I will select upload you see some
of the videos I was watching I click
select upload you guys probably already
know this why am I doing this I have no
idea I want to be comprehensive Adobe
Premiere Pro 9.0 and then where's the
video this one right here I rendered to
816 p.m. which is the time it is
currently while I'm filming this in
Lafayette Louisiana select this video
click open of course and it will begin
uploading boom you're welcome so if you
have any questions about anything that
you saw in this video or you have
suggestions for suggestions suggestions
for future videos let me know in the
comments below give this video a like if
you liked it give it a dislike if you
disliked it for whatever reason let me
know why you disliked it and comments
below as well and stay tuned for more
videos like this for more computer
related videos and more sciency related
videos in general this is science studio
