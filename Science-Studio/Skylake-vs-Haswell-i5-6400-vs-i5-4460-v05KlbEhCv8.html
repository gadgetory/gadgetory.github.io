budget and looking for a pretty sweet
intel core i5 CPU without breaking the
bank
you've probably considered either the i5
4460 or the i-5 6400 they're both very
very similar spec wise and price wise so
which ones better should you go with the
older Haswell platform or the newer
skylake platform let's find out in this
video
so the Intel Core i5 4460 comes packed
with 4 physical cores of course and a
frequency of 3.2 gigahertz which is
turbo boost able up to 3.4 gigahertz
turbo boost able is that does that
actually like is that actually thing it
also comes with six megabytes of l3
cache but ok so what about this guy the
i5 6400 well apart from being slightly
newer and having slightly more efficient
14 nanometer architecture firstly as
well 22 nanometer architecture this guy
right here packs 4 physical cores but at
a stock frequency of only 2.7 gigahertz
which is however turbo boost able up to
3.2 gigahertz so let's see which one's
the all-around better CPU a newer
high-five with a slightly lower
frequency or the older i-5 with the
slightly higher frequency we wanted to
get the specs for both of these
platforms as similar as possible and I
think we did a good job on the skylight
platform we of course have the Intel
Core i5 6400 clocked at 2.7 gigahertz
and azrog z170 pro 4 ATX motherboard 8
gigabytes of PNY anarchie ddr4 down
clock to 2133 megahertz and an a data
120 gigabyte solid state drive on the
has both side of things we have of
course the Intel Core i5 4460 clocked at
3.2 gigahertz and azrog z97 extreme for
LGA 1150 motherboard eight gigabytes of
kingston hyperx ddr3 clocked at 1866
megahertz and the same a data 120
gigabyte solid state drive both rigs
were also equipped with the same AV J
500 watt
plus power supply and a single Sapphire
Radeon r9 380 4 gigabyte graphics card
so you can see that we made things very
very similar we chose a z97 motherboard
on the Haswell side and is the 170
motherboard on the skylake side now we
didn't get the memory matchup just right
but I would like to point out that 20
133 megahertz is like the base that's as
low as you can go for ddr4 without
underclocking for whatever reason and
1866 megahertz on ddr3 side of things is
fairly consistent 1600 megahertz is the
most common but 1866 is actually a
pretty good little boost from that stock
frequency so I think we've gotten the 2
round kits as close to each other as
possible without severely overclocking
the ddr3 and causing operating system
stability issues so 1866 verse 21 33
that sounds good enough to me the first
CPU independent test on our list is
Cinebench r15 and the scores were very
similar between the two the i5 4460
scored 483 while the i5 6400 scored 505
running the free 32-bit Geekbench 3
tests we achieve a 44 60 single core
score of 32 52 while the 6400 achieved
3656 onto the multi-core side of things
the 4460 scored 10,000 158 while the
6,400 scored 11 thousand and seven next
we took a one-minute video file and
rendered it through a W Premiere Pro
using the h.264 YouTube 1080p preset in
this case obviously the lowest time wins
the i5 6400 was able to shave off an
additional 5 seconds that the 4460
wasn't I would like to throw my personal
two cents into the mix on this one
however and that despite its setbacks
the 4460 did a darn good job now under
the thing that I know you definitely
care about and that's gaming performance
so should you expect to see any increase
in frame rates with the newer i-5 6400
well let's find out first up is dying
light a pretty awesome zombie game it's
kind of like GTA 5 but throw zombies in
there
a pretty cool slightly cheesy storyline
and there you have it that's dying light
so things turned out a little strange in
this particular benchmark the i5 4460
managed to achieve an average frame rate
of 76 while the i5 6400 only managed to
achieve an average frame rate of 55 so
something's going on there
switching gaming genres altogether if
you're a fan of car racing and things of
that sort then the dirt rally benchmark
might be of interest to you both
processors perform very well in this
test however the i5 6400 does edge out a
lead in terms of max frames per second
as well as the average just barely the
minimums however did dip slightly lower
for the 6400 and this could just be
because the 6400 is a turbo boost as
high as the 44 60 and some of those
pretty intense moments you know like
when you hit a tree or drive completely
off the road like I managed to do quite
a number of times in that benchmark we
like to save the best for last here in
the studio and that's why grand theft
auto 5 is the last gaming benchmark on
our list I say this all the time and I'm
sorry if this is getting annoying but GT
5 is very very CPU intensive so if
you're looking to stress your CPU and
see just how well it performs and
communicates with your graphics card GTA
5 is the benchmark that you should
consider so how well did both processors
do well the i-5 6400 definitely
definitely is the better processor in
this case the 14 nanometer architecture
of the skylake processor definitely
helps out in this regard but I think
what's more important behind the scenes
is the ddr4 faster memory for games like
GTA 5 definitely aid in frame per second
boost and even decline so if you have
really low frequency ddr4 ddr3 you're
going to see severe frames per second
cuts in games like this this not only
explains the 20% increase in average FPS
between the 44 60 and the 6400 but also
explains the higher max frames per
second that you would see in a newer
platform which is why the 6400
124 frames per second at its peak while
the 4460 was only able to reach 94
frames per second keep in mind that all
these games are being tested at just
1080p I have the presets you know in the
descriptions of the graphs but we're not
testing anything in 1440p or 4k or even
something like 720p or anything crazy
like that just a standard 1080p if you
are curious however about how well the
i5 4460 performs when combined with an
r9 380 4 gigabyte graphics card in 1440p
gaming you can click the link here and
check out the video that I posted well a
day before this video is posting date I
think you'll enjoy that video it is
quite the 1440p performer if I do say so
myself
but see for yourself so this is how I
want to conclude the video I know that
I've said a few times that I don't like
using PC part picker to know put
together any of my builds or link them
in the descriptions because prices
change all the time so I'll put together
a PC part picard pc and it'll be $600 at
the time of its creation and then like a
week later it's either gonna go up in
price or down in price by 20 or $40
something crazy you know I'll strike a
deal and then the deal is gone and then
that whole PC part picker list is is
ruined for the most part so that's kind
of why I don't like using PC port picker
but in this case I did because I wanted
to show you that you could actually put
together both of these platforms for
almost exactly the same price about 630
dollars for both so if you're
considering purchasing either an i5 4460
or an i-5 6400 in at least the United
States where the US dollar reigns
supreme I would recommend going with the
i-5 6400 get the newer platform take
advantage of the skylake architecture
and ddr4 you will see for the most part
frame per second increases compared to
those of the Haswell equivalents and
you're really not gonna pay much more
for the build I mean if you want to just
go bare-bones which I really don't
recommend but you know you're on a
budget and you just want a game and
that's really it you can pick up a
skylake PC for about the same price as a
has well equivalent
at this point in the United States maybe
not somewhere like Australia see I
mentioned Australia hello my Aussies
thanks for checking out the video I'm
sorry that PC parts are so expensive on
your side of the planet that is
unfortunate I wish I could do something
about that then maybe someday but that
goes without saying if Haswell is
significantly cheaper where you live the
performance gains for Sky League aren't
really going to be justified in that
case just purchase a house well i-5 like
this rig behind me you're going to play
games just fine but if you can put
together a skylight build for the same
price as a has well equivalent purchase
the skylight rig it's just just makes
more sense in most games except for
dying light which is still still a
little confusing but we'll address that
maybe in a future video
like I said leave a comment in the
description if you think you know why
that happened
I still can't explain it I reran that
benchmark three times and I just took
the third benchmark because they were
all pretty much the same the i5 4460
took the cake and all three instances by
about the same margin so it is a little
strange but that's why we call this sign
studio this is about trial and error
it's about experimenting and trying to
explain the results that you get and try
to make sense of it all so if you think
that you know why this things happened
leave comments below we appreciate it
I would sure like to know why I think I
have an idea but I don't want to say
anything that's incorrect and that
people bite my head off in the comments
below
I'll spare that speaking of comments be
sure to leave one suggesting future
videos things like that let me know if
you think we did a good job be sure to
leave a like if you liked the video
dislike if you disliked the video and
subscribe for more I like building
computers and stuff this is science
studio thanks for learning with us
