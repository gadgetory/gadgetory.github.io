sending us to Computex 2019 what's going
on everyone here at the team group booth
I'm very nervous cuz she's taking a
picture while I'm filming Wow why the
video cameras not making me nervous it's
like phone camera this is awkward
anyway they have something really nice
there's actually plenty of stuff to show
off here but the thing that caught my
eye is the thing I expect will catch
your eye too and that is the Delta max
our GB SSD check this thing out
I like the whole SSD for the most part
it's like eighty or eighty percent or so
screen coverage but this is beautiful
and they use LEDs on the perimeter to
light up this entire panel for the most
part and then the center has the T Force
logo and that's less I guess glossed
over so it looks brighter
you see Delta max logo there on the
bottom right looking really good two
ways I connect this to your system
you can do it by either via USB 2 or you
can do it via a 5 volt addressable power
GB if you do it USB 2 it's only got one
effect it's just to power it
sorry not to power it just to I get the
LEDs in action and then if you do it by
a 5 volt then you can control individual
LEDs I just broke that doing this and
the another cool thing about this one is
that if you have it off like let's say
your systems off or you don't even plug
it in then it looks like this right here
it just looks like just a regular black
gloss SSD with the T Force logo and you
can't even tell that there's a film or a
screen behind it so really nice when
it's off you can't tell and when it's on
it's blingy AF this is like the most
clickbait SSD I've ever seen but it's
super cool and if you guys looking for
an extreme kit of RGB memory look no
further than yeah it's it's actually
called the extreme a RGB memory kit T
force extreme a RGB this is actually
supposedly the world's first a RGB dim
and you can see right here the LEDs
fairly well diffuse you can kind of see
individual LED lighting here on the side
but from the top which is what you'll
mainly see it's very well diffused and
you can control again because it's a RGB
individual LEDs and you can do that by a
software they'll have coming out with
the kit or you can do it via a
motherboard software whether it be like
msi gigabyte i think
this also works so I'll be talking with
them about that check the video
description for more compatibility but
for now I know for certain that they're
coming out with their own software as
well to control individual LEDs and
their memory kit
now an interesting note about MDOT shoes
when it relates to Gen 4 PCI Express
this is a PCI Gen 4 m dot 2 here and
supposedly when these things run really
fast like around let's say five thousand
megabytes per second they get very hot
and so that's one of the reasons why you
see the speeds here on this one are 3800
megabytes per second reads 3,200 for
writes respectively and the drive
doesn't have a very beefy heatsink on it
a lot of the drives that run it 5,000
megabytes per second reads will have
very thick heat sinks the one from
gigabyte that we saw earlier had a
really large copper slug on top of it
and then also copper underneath it and
they have to keep it cool I mean what's
running that fast it gets very hot in
this case we have just a graphene slab
that's supposedly really good for heat
dissipation but it's just one a little
slab of that on top of the PCB and these
are the t4 scardy a liquid and a 2 PCI
SSDs and these look first off super
colorful and other attractive piece here
at the team group booth but also there's
some practicality here you can fill this
up with pretty much any fluid you want
these small valves you can see on the
ends here that you can unscrew add the
fluid supposedly this fluid Lake
evaporates into thin air that's what
they're telling me if it does you can
always fill it back up not sure about
the applications but they do look mighty
pretty another thing to note if this is
water-based water has a very high heat
capacity so under those quick sprints
where your m2 SSD it's fairly hot this
water can absorb a lot of that heat and
prevent your m2 from thermal throttling
very quick I should actually state there
are different I'm about two drives nvme
or SATA am tattoos would work in this
case you can see these are pretty much
all SATA MDOT twos they have two keys
but anyway looking really colorful and
yeah we'll be sure to test the
practicality of these in a dedicated
video on a channel soon if a t4 spark
RGB ufd and the treasure external RGB
SSD so that's the one you're seeing on
top of the ps4 pro there and then the
thumb drive down below has an RGB
indicator as well that can sync up and
tell you how full
your drive is so let's say you're
approaching 80 90 % storage that light
will actually start to turn closer to a
red color indicating that you've almost
used up all of your space so kind of a
convenient you know industrial use of
our jeebies and something that again
you'll either love or hate and then we
have t4 volc√°n Z T force dark Z we got
nice modules here these don't have any
hard to be on them so if you're not into
that bling game this is your this is
your cup of tea right here you even got
bare PCB Ram over they see that t41 ddr4
just 26 66 megahertz good for Intel
platforms for sure and you get that read
printed on top of the the dims so
looking good in this case now we're
gonna swing over Kyle's gonna try to
walk with a camera it's gonna be
interesting here yeah just just keep me
on there we go we just keep on going
these are all the awards the products
that have won awards from Team Group you
see we had the Excalibur ddr4 you guys
saw this at CES 2019 in Vegas and then
to the left of that we've got the T
Force Nighthawk RGB modules as the black
modules looking really good we've used
us and many builds in the past further
down the line I believe that is the
extreme modules there yep those are the
extreme ddr4 modules you see 48 hundred
megahertz blazing-fast good especially
for rising kits if you can manage to get
your kit to that speed and then also the
delta r gb SSD this is uh one of the
flashy Urartu B SSDs in the market one
thing I didn't mention that I want you
guys there was the video I'm not sure
who it was from where they discovered
that the SSD was throttling itself
because of the built-in RGB LEDs when
you look at this from Team group or the
one we showed you in the beginning of
the video these RGB LEDs are not
integrated into the PCB whereas in the
case of that I don't know if it was a
hyper X Drive or whatever that was
throttling cuz it got too hot because of
the RGB LEDs built into the PCB this is
an extra thing of it's like an external
case and then the PCB is underneath that
right so the RGB s are built into the
case not into the PCB and that's why it
doesn't get very hot so while the RGB I
mean this isn't even hot here I'm not
sure what was going on with that kit in
that video but these are very cool you
can't feel heat really emanating from
this at all and the same goes for that
first SSD we showed you where that
screen pretty much took up
entire case of that SSD wasn't hot so if
that's a concern of yours don't worry
about that timbers got it under control
again it's not it doesn't involve LEDs
built into the PCB and that's the
concern that a lot of you will probably
have after watching that video I think
it was from Jay I'm not sure who did it
but if you saw the video you know
exactly what I'm talking about
so that is it for our team group
coverage they've got a lot of stuff we
try to show you as much of it as we
could it's a huge booth cop you want to
show you know kind of up hand of what
they've got going on here it's a huge
space there's like some kind of weird
intercom thing going on here but two
stories up there is where they do a lot
of the marketing deals and stuff but
they've done a really nice job here they
used to be in a suite and they pretty
much thrown their budget into a show
floor piece like this and I really like
what they've done the publicity is nice
you can see how busy it is here people
like what they've got to offer thank you
guys for watching stay tuned for more
coverage here at Computex 2019 this is
science to do thanks for watching again
and thanks for learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
