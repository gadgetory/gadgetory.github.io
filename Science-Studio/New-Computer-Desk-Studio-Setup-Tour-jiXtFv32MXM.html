the studio we'll go kind of there you'll
see that more when we start setting it
up but this is from a company called
tribe sign I think it's kind of hard to
see that far right there but that isn't
our this is about a 55-pound desk it's
about 20 or so kilograms for those who
don't live in the US and we're going to
be setting this up we're going to
hopefully be able to fit all of our
computer gear on top of this desk it
should be quite a bit larger and have a
bit more surface area than our other
l-shaped desk in Louisiana so without
further ado let's go ahead and put this
thing together and then on up I'll just
kind of some impressions as we go you're
interested in this desk I have it linked
in the video description along with my
other desk this one was about a hundred
and forty bucks which still isn't bad
for an l-shaped desk mind you now this
isn't you know top of the line or
anything by any means they also have the
other else a desk before link in the
description as well that one is
considerably cheaper it is just a bit
smaller not as sturdy as far as I'm
aware and I'll confirm that after we put
this thing to get it so let's go ahead
and do that
so you can see what we got here so far
this is just basically a metal frame and
then those that's plywood or what but
that will be our desk surface now this
was very simple to install
I'm almost finished but I wanted to show
you how easy it actually was you can see
we have all of these screws here the
larger thicker ones are used to hold the
metal beams in place those are these
these beams here that we are basically
locking to you this is like the chassis
if you will of the desk sorry about the
terrible auto focus and any smaller ones
I assume are going to be for holding the
wood in place etc so what I want to do
is just give you an example how simple
this is so I've got this last beam here
to connect this is kind of like a
footrest you think there's a hallway to
the back and it's as simple as funneling
the screw through there are a little
groove inside here that the screw will
catch on to and boom just like that you
could included tools as well and it's
literally that simple it's really nice
this is actually easier to install than
my previous l-shaped desk I'm very happy
so far with the installation process
okay I found one flaw and this is
something that I was reading about in
the reviews I figured I'd run into this
eventually
so this hole right here is basically a
guide for screw that supposed to go up
through there and into basically a
little cutout in the board to secure the
board to the chassis
well this hole is not aligned with the
hole drilled in the wood which means
that I'm going to have to improvise here
I'll probably end up just probably
loosening this bolt trying to twist this
beam kind of around this way so that I
can angle it more toward the cutout in
the board let's see how this goes
so in addition to purchasing the desk
online I also picked up some of these
cable sleeves here they're just a Velcro
adhesive nothing special about them but
you can cut them down to size which is
great and they're fairly cheap as well
they're also linked in the description
so if you want to kind of cable manage
as you go not stuff inside your PC
obviously but just cables that are kind
of sprouting out from your PC or your
screen or maybe a receiver something
along those lines then something like
this is excellent for that and the fact
you can cut it down to size is great so
that's what I'll be doing I'll be lining
kind of just with floorboards here
underneath the tables to hide some of
those cables just make it look a bit
more tidy
all right and I'm going to call it quits
at this point I think that I've done a
good enough job cable managing there's
nothing sprawling down behind the desk
and I've used one of those velcro DS of
things to conceal the cables that are
running from the subwoofer and other
speaker wires things like that so I'm
going to call it kind of like an 8 out
of 10 maybe 9 out of 10 obviously I said
done much better behind this little
plastic shelf thing there are just so
many cables going in so many directions
back there that there's virtually no way
that I can cable manage that without
cutting into the wall and hiding things
behind the wall so that's just kind of
how it's going to be for now maybe if I
come across some kind of desk shuffling
to put here that has like some kind of
backing you can't see those cables just
laying down behind it that would be a
solution but for now that's about as
good as it's going to get I think it
looks clean though I think that the
setup is is decent considering what I
have to use I'm a big fan of this desk I
do recommend it I actually prefer this
desk more than I preferred the other
cheaper desk you get what you pay for
here in this case you're paying about
twice as much as you would for the other
case linked in the description that I
used earlier in previous builds here's
an example right here but this desk is
it just suits my needs better it's
bigger it just has more space to work
and that's exactly what I need in this
room so without further ado here is the
new studio will be here will be this way
for quite a while thanks for watching
and stay tuned for my next video gtx
980ti time with the accelerate version
it can be pretty cool I think you'll
enjoy that one this is science studio
thanks for building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
