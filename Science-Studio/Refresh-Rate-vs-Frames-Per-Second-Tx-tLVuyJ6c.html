what's the difference between FPS which
stands for frames per second and refresh
rate which is usually denoted by Hertz
if you've been recently shopping for a
new TV or new computer monitor you
probably notice the specification
denoted by Hertz usually 60 Hertz or 120
Hertz 240 Hertz even 480 Hertz in some
cases but what does refresh rate have to
do with the number of frames per second
that the monitor displays well the
answer is nothing at all in the case of
a computer the graphics card or
integrated graphics processor in some
cases is typically the sole determinant
of how many FPS you see on a monitor now
what the monitors job is is to translate
that data into a moving picture but this
is where refresh rate comes into play
basically the refresh rate of a monitor
or television is the number of times
that a signal can be transmitted to the
screen per second so in a way refresh
rate is a type of frame per second
parameter but it has nothing to do with
the number of frames per second that
enter the screen from the source the
computer DVD or blu-ray player or
channel service provider so let's set up
a hypothetical let's say I have a
computer that's pushing about 30 frames
per second from the computer to my
monitor and my monitor happens to be a
60 Hertz monitor that's typical of most
cheap displays so if my monitor is
capable of refreshing its screen 60
times per second and my computer is only
sending to 30 frames per second via DVI
or HDMI cable then we're in the clear
often times what happens is the monitor
or TV will interpolate frames in between
those that it's receiving from its
source so if my 60 Hertz monitor is
receiving 30 frames per second from my
computer then it will interpolate
in between each frame if the computer is
sending 40 frames per second to my 60
Hertz monitor then my monitor might
interpolate between every other set of
frames rather than between every set of
frames but then this raises the question
what if my computer is sending more
frames per second than the refresh rate
of my monitor so let's say now that
instead of 30 or 40 frames per second
and my source is sending to my 60 Hertz
monitor the source is sending 120 frames
per second
what will the monitor do there well
there's actually not much it can do it's
really only going to send out a true 60
frames per second because this is what
the monitor is capable of now there are
instances in which you can overclock to
an extent the refresh rate of a monitor
but you'll be lucky to get maybe 15 to
20 Hertz on top of what you're already
rated at so if a source is sending 120
frames per second to your 60 Hertz TV or
monitor chances are you aren't seeing
the full picture the same case applies
to a 240 frames per second source or
anything above that so what's the sweet
spot
well obviously 60 Hertz is pretty common
in fact most monitors and TVs that
you'll find on Amazon Newegg and even in
local stores happen to be 60 Hertz it's
just cheaper this way and to tell you
the truth the human eye can't discern
much of a difference between 60 frames
per second and 120 frames per second but
this doesn't mean that you should just
settle for 60 Hertz 120 Hertz is
becoming more and more common if you
shop for TVs over Black Friday or Cyber
Monday you probably notice that be where
fresh rates were directly correlated to
the price tags of those televisions
meaning that a TV with a higher refresh
rate was likely more expensive than its
a lower fresh rate counterpart if you
have a newer TV with a 120 or 240 Hertz
refresh rate you've probably noticed
that when watching HD you'll say blu-ray
movies subtle wobbles in the camera or
the occasional sutter of something that
you wouldn't have known
in a sixty Hertz display these little
micro jolts and micro anomalies are the
result of a higher refresh rate so it's
a higher refresh rate worth the extra
money well that's up to you
some people hate seeing those little
micro anomalies and micro movements and
the cameras it seemed less professional
others like myself personally enjoy
seeing things like that it makes the
movie seem more realistic and not so
artificial stable check out your local
electronics store that sells TVs and
even hatch them on display and decide
for yourself whether you prefer
something that seems more stable or
arguably seems more realistic this
assign studio thanks for learning
