get this question a lot and it always
calls for some heated debate in some
forum or livestream or Twitter feed but
it really shouldn't have to there are
objective facts dividing the two sides
each consumer is free to navigate
between them according to the utility
each may provide in any given scenario
no two people are alike and what I mean
simply by that is this some may see more
value from Intel and others may see more
value from AMD so which should you
choose I'll try to narrow down the
competition in this video to make your
decision just a bit easier one thing I
want to make perfectly clear before I
discuss anything else is that I'm not
being paid by anyone to make this video
I'm not even throwing a sponsor in this
video because I don't want anything like
that swaying what I'm going to say here
this is straight from the heart and my
experience over the years for once we
have healthy competition in the consumer
CPU space and I finally feel comfortable
enough to give you guys the inside scoop
so you don't have to agree with what I'm
going to say but I'm going to say it
anyway so the first two questions you
should ask yourself when deciding
between platforms is what you'll be
doing more of think long and hard about
these two gaming or creating and what
your budget is I've said this time and
time again but if you want to purely
game and that is it you should forego a
core i7 from Intel purchase an unlocked
AI 5 still one of the best CPUs out
there for gaming though the save money
into a better graphics card and a better
cooler period that's my recommendation
but not all are cut and dry like this
the i5 8600 k as I proved in this video
right here keeps up with the i7
counterpart and nearly every title in
1080p the higher the resolution remember
the less stress you'll put on it but
fewer and fewer people are doing just a
gaming anymore many are multitasking
streaming content creating and this is
where AMD arisin comes in without a
doubt the red team hosts better value
that's just I think we can all agree on
that
the rise of 5 1600 is in my opinion the
best value chip on the market and while
not the greatest for gaming will still
keep frame rates in desirable levels
even when paired with something like a
1080 Ti your CP might be the bottleneck
in some cases but don't worry you'll be
just fine
so let's break this down by price
category if you are only looking to
spend roughly 500 US equivalent dollars
on a rig you should stay in reisender
territory I wouldn't even recommend
Intel for this budget just because we
only have Z 370 chipsets at our disposal
right now
so with all rising CPUs and you can
overclock healthily on both be 350 and X
370 motherboards I recommend be 350 for
up to Rison 5 and X 370 for risin 7 and
risin plus processors for the extra
overclocking Headroom you might need
later on with that said though one thing
you should know is that choosing horizon
means that you'll have a difficult time
overclocking past roughly 4 gigahertz a
feature in which Intel reigns supreme is
overclock ability that much of this can
be attributed to the fact that we've
been refining the exact same process for
several years now you won't need a beefy
air cooler with any Rison 3 CPU and I
wouldn't spend any more than about a
hundred bucks or so on an 1800 X cooler
unless you're going for something as
ostentatious as custom water cooling in
which case all bets are off for unlocked
Intel SKUs however you may want to
consider something like the be quiet
dark Rock pro 4 on the air cooling side
or a 360 MLA o like the new course or h
150 i pro if your budget is closer to
1,000 USD equivalent then you likely
have two CPUs from which to choose the
r5 1600 and the i5 8600 K both are
extremely capable but for different
reasons the i5 will be the better gamer
you'll see anywhere between a 5 and 15%
framerate bump in most titles in 1080p
but the r5 will cost less especially
when the price of a be 350 motherboard
is taken into account and despite having
the same number of active cores the r5
1600 boasts simultaneous multi-threading
or SMT which is essentially AMD's hyper
threading equivalent these extra virtual
threads reduce both processing and
efficiencies associated with data stream
line through individual pipelines more
on that right here but what you need to
know in this video is that the i-5 will
still squeak out victories in most tasks
including content creation thanks to
higher frequencies and better software
optimization you may get lucky on the
RAM side as well which could influence a
few tasks as for the top tier stuff this
really comes down to preference
I used Rison 7 in my daily driver for
several months thanks to the 8 core 16
thread offerings and it was superior in
every way to my i7 6700 case a gaming
but that wasn't as big of a concern for
me with the release of the 8700 K though
things have been shaken up a bit I now
switch periodically between both plat
for gaming and editing and have to say
that both perform very well many of the
kinks have been worked out from the
initial rise and launch including RAM
compatibility and bio stability so you'd
be hard-pressed to tell the difference
between an r7 and i7 machine in short if
you want great value and performance for
everything literally go to Rison 7 but
if you want the absolute best at the
expense of may be fewer cores which may
impact things like streaming several
years from now people arguing on the
future proofing thing then go with the
core i7 oh and one last thing try to
avoid a risin 1c if use ending in X
they're marketed as better overclockers
but since you can do this with literally
any of them from r3 up through r7 it
makes no sense in my book to spend more
money on chips that will overclock much
higher than their non ex counterparts
unless you plan on doing no manual
overclocking and while the r5 1600 X has
a higher TDP an out-of-the-box boost
frequency you should know that this is
only for a single thread similar to
turbo boost you shouldn't have much
trouble reaching similar frequencies
anyway with the cheaper 1600 nan XQ
assuming you have a beefy enough cooler
and solid motherboard with Intel though
things are a bit monotone if you're
looking to completely upgrade platforms
coffee-like is in my opinion the only
viable option out there otherwise Rises
value reigns supreme so you have no
choice with the blue team but to invest
in the Izzi 370 chipset at which point
it only makes sense to buy unlock CPUs
namely the i5 8600 K and the i7 8700 K
which is why I've only mentioned those
two from Intel in this video with that I
hope this video at least clears up a bit
of your predicament it's gonna be a
difficult decision no matter what
especially if you want a game and
multitask you know do something else in
the background you can find all these
CPUs by the way linked in the video
description along with motherboards I'd
recommend for them and they're tied to
my Amazon and Newegg affiliate so I do
get a small kickback or punch back if
you decide to purchase something through
them with YouTube's algorithm hitting
medium and smaller channels pretty hard
lately it all adds up and I appreciate
your support
even if all you do is view this video if
you like this one by the way be sure to
give this one a thumbs up I appreciate
it thumbs down full of the obstacle you
subscribe but if you haven't already in
stay tuned for more content like this
also a pretty cheap PC build which many
of you should be interested in this is
