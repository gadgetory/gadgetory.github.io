studio the holidays are approaching and
that means so our Black Friday and Cyber
Monday will show you here how you can
build yourself an Intel skylight gaming
PC for around six hundred dollars which
seems to be the sweet spot for the
average consumer typical sky like built
here on YouTube feature either the 6600
k or the 6700 k that the cpu prices lead
to build costing upwards of eight
hundred to a thousand dollars and we
here in the studio don't want to leave
the budget-conscious consumers behind
the solution settling for modest to core
for thread CPU the Intel i3 6100 stay
tuned for a future video featuring this
build so as we've just highlighted the
intel core i3 6100 is a dual-core hyper
threaded processor from the new skylake
lineup and while this one in particular
isn't a fancy quad hexa or octa-core cpu
it's 3.7 gigahertz dual-core
architecture certainly holds its own
especially when you consider its price
we found the lowest offer yet on
supervised supervised superb is I don't
know for 123 99 which is actually only a
few dollars more than the Haswell
equivalent i3 processor the i3 4160 the
hyper threading advantages on the 6100
mimic to an extent a 4 core processor
and should allow us to run games
efficiently and without severe or really
even moderate bottlenecks will need a
motherboard to house our cpu and in this
case will specifically need a socket LGA
1151 board there are several options to
choose from and we opted for the asrock
z 170 pro 4 board due to its
upgradability and admittedly its fancy
design the Z 170 chipset allows for
overclocking which can't be utilized
with our I 3 but could certainly be
taken advantage of with an upgraded k
cpu such as the 6600 k or the 6700 k the
board comes in a variety of variants
including as rocks fatality edition
which packs an
extra ddr4 boost and built-in Wi-Fi
regardless of your decision between the
two these pro 4 boards certainly hold
their own and at a price of just 117 99
this LG a socket 1151 motherboard will
not steer you in the wrong direction the
next piece to our puzzle is RAM now
since ddr4 is available and supported by
our asrock board will be seizing the
opportunity here i scavenged newegg in
amazon for quite a bit in search of
relatively cheap reasonably fast ddr4
dimm and miraculously came across these
bad boys pan Ram ninja five sticks they
come in a pack of 24 gigabyte variants
allowing for a dual channeling and also
boast a hefty 2666 megahertz memory
clock speed which should give us a few
extra FPS in CPU intensive games GTA 5
comes to mind the graphics card choice
is entirely up to you what I like to do
is purchase everything else first and
then splurge with my remaining budget on
the best graphics card I can afford I
opted for an Asus Strix are 73 74
gigabyte variant not only for its quiet
nature in adamant standards of
reliability but also for the potential
to crossfire this card with another one
in the future if you watched our review
video of this particular card you know
that its fans don't even turn on until
temps reach around 60 degrees celsius
and the four gigabytes vram is more than
enough for running almost any game at
high quality in 1080p resolution if you
want a bit more horsepower but don't
mind cutting back on the vram snatch up
and r9 380 or a gtx 960 for around the
same price deals are fastly approaching
you can get some of these cards for
quite a steal we have the online 382
gigabyte XFX variant featured in our
latest build here next comes storage I'm
not particularly a storage hog kind of
guy so 240 gigabytes of solid-state
storage will be plenty for my extraneous
files and few games on steam i really
only play GTA 5 I that's a huge game 62
gigabyte
or something like that but that's really
the only game i ever have installed on
my storage device so if you're a guy
who's more concerned about storage or
maybe a girl who likes to play multiple
games at the same time then I go ahead
and snatch up a seagate 1 terabyte hard
drive for around forty dollars keep in
mind however that boot times and file
loading times jump up significantly when
you decide to forgo the SSD I like to
choose my case and power supply last the
reason I choose the PSU last is because
I'd like to get an idea of how much
power my computer is going to draw under
idle and full loads I then multiply the
load wattage summation by a factor of
about 1.5 basically a safety factor and
then select a power supply base on this
calculated value in a case of this bill
the 500 watts is more than enough and
even leaves the possibility of adding a
second card with a bit of room to spare
we do however recommend purchasing a
modular crossfire or sli configured
power supply if you plan on utilizing
two GPUs right away this power supplies
cables plenty long enough to reach our
terminals in the case we've chosen which
is in a segue of sorts the NZXT s3 40 so
super buys is currently running there s
3 40's 463 99 which is the lowest I've
ever seen this case sell for for
reference i actually purchased mine for
around $75 plus shipping and handling
and NZXT case for this price is
phenomenal and features were not
compromised for such a budget sticker
price NZXT provides to stock fans to
dust filters a large side window and
minimalistic aesthetics with plenty of
room for future expandability Linus
Sebastian and many other popular
channels on YouTube have covered this
case simply due to its amazing appeal
and stellar price of course however the
s3 40 is one of many cases you can pick
up for a competitive price just make
sure that what you purchase will fit all
of the parts accordingly it would be a
shame to you know have to have all your
parts ready to go only to find out that
your motherboard power supply of what
have you won't fit
our latest build features the NZXT of
the white windowed edition and we have
been more than satisfied with the looks
as well as the temperatures that we're
getting under load add a few LEDs prop
it up on a desk and watch as your
computer tower turns into a valuable
piece of eye candy and furniture so
that's it folks our grand total as of
november nineteenth 2015 comes out to
just over six hundred and twenty bucks
not including shipping though most of
these items can be shipped free of
charge the case is really the only
exception that immediately comes to mind
oh and one other thing don't doubt this
little sky like i three this thing is
the little engine that could just check
out some of these benchmarks uploaded by
Hardware unboxed their channel link is
in the description if you're interested
we greatly appreciate your interest in
this video and we look forward to
building it actually very soon if you
haven't already be sure to leave us a
like or a dislike depending on whether
you thought we did a great or terrible
job and be sure to subscribe for more
from our channel this is science to do
