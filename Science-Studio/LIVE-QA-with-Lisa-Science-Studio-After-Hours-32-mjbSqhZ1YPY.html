now we have the normal latency this time
which means we will be slightly more
delayed the expense when we went with
the shorter latency er that the minimal
latency was video quality it wasn't too
sharp looking the last time we did it
that way so we're swapping on back to
the good stuff or what are we looking at
here oh that's 480p that's why it looks
terrible
okay yeah it looks a lot better well I
look like an idiot cuz I'm like sitting
there wait I can't it like says almost
like you mean goals it's live
immediately you never know what happened
but it didn't tell me that it was alive
it's a preparing to stream and then it
was one - you saw that you saw that
delay oh look I look so dawn you have to
be ready once you press the button I
know I know I assumed that I forgot to
bring my forgot to bring my laptop in
here so we're gonna have to look at chat
now on on my phone so cool oh I can hear
as I was talking okay so we can just
look at that little tiny thing right
there and yeah my man Zack says love the
channel guys but got to keep going on
these finals projects hey man school
comes first
but I appreciate you stopping by and
we're just gonna hang out answer some
questions I'm gonna leave all the
technical stuff for Lisa she's like over
prepared for that
she's been studying all weekend to
answer all of your questions so you guys
have anything at all related to tech in
general that you want to ask her she's
ready to go
and I'm gonna sit back and sit back and
watch and no yeah I'm waiting for
questions I'm going for something in
depth questions here this is gonna be
really fun no no this is new to me I
hear that's this the first time they ask
really good questions though some like
oh well I'd say a lot of them are like
like somewhere really really difficult
yeah I'm gonna do all their research
yeah someone says alt f4 gets you more
RAM and that's definitely I know that
don't do that
let's see we have Bailey Harris hey say
your name Bailey how hard is a YouTube
channel to run definitely difficult if
it was easy everyone would do it it's
something that I don't know you just
kind of just kind of start up and you
don't expect it to turn into something
and then maybe it does maybe it doesn't
it all depends on how much effort you
want to put into it the kind of content
you upload there are tons of variables
but yeah we have tons of videos talking
about the different hurdles I've
personally gone through how I've tackled
certain things like with regards to
inventory like how do we get like stuff
to review and that's buying and selling
on Craigslist that was a part of the
reason I got into it and so there's a
lot there's a lot of stuff that goes
into it how did you start your YouTube
channel yeah I open it I sign in and I
just left it there just to leave likes
and subscriptions that is bingos waiting
for you to slap me upside the head how
would you do that for $2 Oh even for one
I don't know why you would Sinaiticus
beus oh no no it's proof livestream you
guys saw it firsthand it's a good
question Treyarch pvp would you say the
average consumer would notice the
difference between ddr4 thirty two
hundred thirty six hundred assuming
until chipset I know you wouldn't notice
much of a difference at all if any
difference at all most games aren't
gonna know you wanted to let me answer
sorry no this you wouldn't you wouldn't
notice any difference at all you
wouldn't notice any difference at all uh
let's see
Marv I was get this question actually
this is your question have you ever
considered hacking toshing no do you
know it no okay what does hackintosh
sound like you're an Apple fan girl yeah
Megan touch I talk okay yeah that's me
Macintosh
is that when you jailbreak the iron you
- I can't think why you'd say that ah
yes it is yeah well okay hackintosh is
basically flashing a Mac OS onto a
windows-based machine or a machine that
you build from scratch that's not like
Apple proprietary not like so you can't
install everything yeah well what you
could do when you jailbreak it it's not
really you're not really jailbreaking it
though I mean you look up a Thresh
operator a fresh hard outcome is the
same
not really I mean it's just you're just
putting mac OS on to a desktop don't do
it you know a PC that otherwise would be
running Linux or Windows right and
there's certain like it's it's difficult
because like you have to wait for Mac OS
to like support the hardware so only
certain hardware up to a certain
generation works with it and it's it's
not easy it's why I haven't done it it's
just a lot of like jailbreak it first
and then hackintosh you there's no never
mind jailbreak Mac OS like is it even a
thing I don't know I I was a long time
ago when I jailbreak the first iPad and
that's it yeah I remember my uncle had a
he had an iPhone 4 I thought he was the
coolest dude around and he jailbroken
like the next day he was dude annual
transitions like you would slide like
from one one home screen to the other
and like all the apps would zigzag up
and down like like you're playing like
what's that game called snakes nuts oh
yeah yeah yeah
yeah I like that yeah that was so cool
those animations I missed those it was
really fun I think uh thrown enough $5
your way slap him heartily okay I
shouldn't read that bazinga sad story
there are there are not many Christmas
trees around okay I feel like you got
your five dollars worth in on that
buzzing I will do this privately I'm a
record
I'm gonna send it to you can do this in
live stream though now you just proved
it in Ted let's save is there a lawyer
in the chat there are there are no
Christmas trees I mean they're very few
I should say because everyone's homes
got wiped out in most people's homes all
the trees and stuff in the attics when
the roofs caved in
they all got soaked and moldy and
damaged so they threw him all away and
then everyone out and bought brand-new
Christmas trees to the point where there
was no more inventory and I know as of
today I had a friend on Facebook was
looking for a Christmas tree anywhere
she could buy one couldn't find one at
Lowe's Ace Hardware even Walmart was out
and like I I I didn't I don't know about
this side of town but yeah that's one of
the reasons why we don't have one
because I want one I want to feel
festive yeah we cannot drive to another
city yeah we order with the pink I just
order one on Amazon you order a tree on
Amazon
no yeah and you you can't get order
anyway we didn't order anything on
Amazon I bet you I use to yeah that's
true oh here's a good one this one's for
you
human Mitch ma ma q MIT human Mik human
face I see it now I see it okay once you
make you move me what do you prefer
iOS or Android why is this for me it's a
question for you you're answering all
questions I prefer I prefer if I use but
I'm used to it that's why if I go back
to Android now it always takes me a long
time to get back into it but if I would
be like a beginner for the start I would
prefer Android more it's more similar to
Windows I remember you had a g6 when I
met you right yeah I had a g6 we were
sponsored by a g6 and I had this cell
phone and of course I had to use it and
with it was so confusing because I
changed from iOS to Android I've
switched between both so many times like
it's just kind of it's pretty fluid for
me don't show that on camera people are
gonna be disappointed in you know
they're going to be disappointed and you
could show that on camera
okay yeah I'm just sparing you the
humiliation on screen if you flash such
a device it's forbidden
can't do it let's see when you think
about the freesync on non-free sync
monitor thing I have no idea
jolly Ollie Bali but I'll be sure to
investigate let's see here a quick
question would you recommend every time
someone said I know I literally have to
hold the chatter like skips down would
you recommend transcend 256 gig or
Samsung 850 Evo I've used Samsung a 50
Evo is for a long time I have like three
of them just sitting in the closet and I
always put them in my budget bills
because they're pretty cheap drives now
so I'd say Samsung Samsung make some
really good memory I would just go with
the just the name-brand on principle but
I have used a transcend Drive I think a
single transcend Drive in the past never
had any issues with that my memory is
one of those things like it really
doesn't matter to an extent what what
you really what do you what you do what
you really pay for is like the the
software like so Samsung like operating
like you can transfer operating systems
and all that a lot easier using
Samsung's proprietary software I figure
the name of it is do I really that's
really what you're buying into more than
anything because most drives are going
to be ok
the thing that will donate $100 if you
hit him in the face with a pie next
Sunday night
make it a cherry or blueberry pie must
be on stream oh I would look off a
cherry pie yeah but I can eat the rest
there's not gonna be a rest you're gonna
smash my face yeah we make a blueberry
please I like blueberry pie alright
whatever we find that's a deal we're
gonna make some blueberry pie that's a
deal any has to keep talking right with
the blueberry face the whole live stream
you know that hmm no oh it was part of
the deal I think I'm gonna go off I'm
gonna go off camera and
clean up while you know an old by singer
right uh oh uh oh I know this these are
the stipulations I'm gonna screenshot
this just so we just so we have proof
right there ref 920 what bits of electro
engineering have you studied in your
major so we studied circuits that was
really the extent of it Circuit's logic
gates stuff like that we got it into a
little bit of AC current that was when
it started getting pretty dicey for me
DC was pretty straightforward I could
visualize it if I can visualize it it's
really easy to explain and understand
but AC current is a totally different
ballgame and that was where I started
getting tripped up we only had really
one class like all engineers had to take
Electrical Engineering but that was the
only Electrical Engineering class we had
to take in our major if you were a
mechanical or a civil you might have had
to take a couple more
but Petroleum's only had to take one and
that was just a core engineering class
we all had to take let's see good
question here this is for YouTube a
remington fernandez off-topic question
what's your dream car jeep I'm just
saying that me so really when did you so
bad me when I keep telling her that
jeeps are like the worst cars to
maintain especially when they're used
and had like a hundred and fifty
thousand miles only one thing which is
what she wants she wants like an old
junker Jeep ok the r8 I mean yeah yeah I
mean yeah I mean yeah then was always my
favorite car it looks super sporty some
day it's super fast someday one day a
yellow one I don't know I think math
blog would also be really good yeah yeah
you know but that's gonna be the Lambo
genie
ya know he lost buying cars don't don't
give him ideas guy oh gosh let's see
Tikaram eyes asking question about he
can't see anything show up on his
display he's tried everything I have a
troubleshooting video type in
troubleshooting science to do sure
come up the first video that shows up
there I talk about what happens or what
you should do if that happens it's
difficult to diagnose over a chat I'd
have to be there in person but more than
likely that your graphics card or it's
if your graphics card fans are turning
it's lighting up it looks like it's
posting but you're not getting any
signal then it might be the cable it
could be the monitor maybe you're
plugging your HDMI into the wrong port
maybe you're trying to run off of
integrated graphics and study your
graphics card or vice versa a lot of
different variables to consider but I
invite you to watch that troubleshooting
videos should help you out quite a bit
that's literally why I made that video
ah let's see mr. KF gaming says hey I am
not so late this time see how many stars
he's got hmm it doesn't mean he's a four
star he's a four-star general
oh he say he's a four a month
recurring member oh so he's been a
member for actually coming up on five
months now if I'm if I recall correctly
maybe six I don't know I like YouTube
only lets me split it up into four
different like chunks of time so I did
one month two month three month and I
think the next one was six months it was
a minute I couldn't do four months or I
would've you know there's no difference
really but yeah so he's a long time
member so is Cody cilok see Cody is also
a fourth star member she's been around
for half a year so yeah Chris Collins
sorry would know nothing I ever thought
about analyzing core count verse clock
speed in various Suites of apps I'm
curious since we're in the core war is
how operating systems and apps are
adapting to extra extra cores actually
the video where I disable core is down
to one core and scale all the way up and
show how frame rates differ it was more
game oriented not necessarily
application base the only application
I'd be interested in with regards to the
core optimization would be like Adobe
the Adobe suite is it raining really
hard on something wow the power goes out
and stream cuts off you guys you guys
know what happened but yeah I've already
done a video similar to that I might go
back at some point and just revisit it
especially now that core counts you know
a core CPUs are pretty mainstream but
that's a good good idea too good topic
that was why
originally decided to pursue that but
will circle back to it I'm against soon
if you haven't watched that video that I
invite you to I think you'll enjoy it
let's see scrolling down on Zack Hartley
ask how is it being Gregg pretty good
how's your day oh yeah good good yeah
it's good no no I was reaching already
the next good what's already streaming
today a lot and I'm full focusing on
bazinga is like fully on your side here
this is getting ridiculous yeah this is
right so we have that too now so it's a
proof you have to have the live stream
with the blueberry cheese cake the
cheese cake or pie oh they don't have
the capacity on here do they they used
to no I thank you 64 gig right yeah it's
got a 64 like she doesn't need one Tony
and honestly his phones are already
expensive enough like yeah I think it's
fine wishes you don't really put a ton
of music on there now anymore do you
I used to use all the storage on my
phone for music but now we should need
with all the streaming services like
Pandora and Spotify and all that like
you don't even need a music library
unless you want to put videos on your on
your iPhone but then you could still
stream movies for no I wouldn't do that
because it copies it on my watch so when
I go and work out I just I don't have to
bring my phone with it and I can just
stream the music I've on the cell phone
with my watch mistress so you actually
have music stored on the phone like real
not yet but on my old iPhone I had and
you can stream it to the to the watch
yeah and then it's true that from the
Watsons oh that's not bad copy how many
songs do usually have in your library I
had you know for working out and that's
it
okay yeah that's like me I always
download like like maybe a dozen and
then I'll like move on to another dozen
later
you know cycle that way yeah but I use
the storage and we're more for pictures
that's the most thing if you yeah
pictures yeah
but after time you put him on the PC and
stuff random it's good oh yeah
Mad Chris 49 says I love your posters
well thank you very much that poster
right there in case y'all are wondering
that is an assassin's Creed origins
poster
she's got a good taste one behind me is
sorry
minecraft yeah he plays that game why do
you have to go and tell them that's cute
nah I play minecraft I I'm not guilty or
what's the word I'm looking for I'm not
ashamed
yeah I'm not ashamed and then also
what's the what's the call of duty crash
bandicoot's in the way uh yeah call of
duty I didn't I've never played that
game I just thought the poster looked
cool I played black ops 3 that was the
last Call of Duty I ever played and then
Bo came over and I played black ops for
I played like that battle royale
interesting it's interesting yeah it's
it's a little different doesn't feel the
same as black ops 3 did which was
arguably a crap game because the physics
were totally you could like sprint
across the map like with a jet pack he
wasn't that good probably that's that's
why I hated that game and at the same
time loved it because I was really good
at it
like my KTR average deathmatch was like
2.6 hardcore was like 1.9 I've done
pretty well for myself it's still proud
of that but now the game's obsolete so
nobody plays it except the hackers and
that's that's a memory shooter game
yeah Jason says Carl love duty
no csgo posters we need one for you
mm-hmm but we I don't have to see skull
poster yeah wait why don't just know
there weren't available on Walmart well
yeah I know yeah we bought all of our
posters in Walmart shoes just like
whatever they have yeah let's see but
Baba as a black ops one and to die hard
for is nice yeah I think that's I think
four has the physics of one or two it
just doesn't it doesn't feel fresh or
yeah maybe that's where to me it doesn't
feel fresh like black ops 3 did and
black ops 3 in my opinion was fresh in a
bad way but those who were used to it
those who could kind of add
just like the jumping across the map
thing to me black ops 3 has the physics
of like halo that's gonna sound really
weird but that game had a lot more in
common I think with Halo than it
actually did with other Call of Duty
titles even from Treyarch so yeah again
probably a far-fetched idea I used to
play consoles all the time then let's
see here how many hours per day do you
spend playing video games how many do
you spend today today only today no okay
I was dreaming three hours of video
games I probably been a little more yeah
that counts to a mean I'm playing well
yeah but you're streaming yeah I
streaming using yeah oh he's playing and
streaming like like well let's just
assume he means casually like do you
ever just like how often you casually
play like you say like three hours maybe
yeah three hours per day maybe mmm but
there are also days off so yeah yeah and
we always try to go to the gym and stuff
like we try to we try we go out and do
stops right I don't just sit on our
butts all day we try I can't show them
on screen no cuz then I channel channel
might get flagged
oh is that someone wanting gun
propagation feeds on YouTube on Twitch
you can't show fear you can't your feet
because people will show your feet and
we donate money and then we're reading
people donating money just if you show
your feet even with considered poor in
there I'm know it's like a foot fetish
that's like porn yeah it's basically
Pournami
I mean I could see I could see like guys
get now I don't know I don't want to
show my Pikachu socks because otherwise
yeah and then yeah we don't want that
that is interesting though I I heard
that story at one point but I never
actually thought about it on vacations
of showing feet until like what if it's
just unintentional what if you just like
you stand up on your chair while the
street wise and you're like oh sorry
if you
purpose so it's so it's when you solicit
for money by showing your feet it's like
prostitution not really not prostitution
now it's like it's like people that pay
to watch porn I guess it's no different
it's not actual anyway I don't know
anyway yeah so it says this is white
which is great yeah twitch bandit lol
that's so funny
Zach 77 keeps asking if I keep saying I
missed his huge question I see you said
love me I thought I see that Zach that's
what you're talking about
oh okay I can chair yeah we have a new
member by the way I see starfish it's st
four one three fish has become a member
a fish yes it only costs five dollars I
say only to some people that I get it
it's a lot you know if you don't want to
spend any money to help out or whatever
it's not necessary all you guys got to
do with watch and that goes a long way
but if you want to be a member and it's
five bucks YouTube gives us three
dollars and fifty cents of that so
YouTube's only getting a buck fifty and
that money's basically treated like it's
similar to patreon although you do get
in in-app benefits I guess you would
call them maybe kind of sort of their
you get low icons like if you see I want
to find here let's see if he's if you
see starfish now has he has a star next
to his name right and that shows that
he's a one-month member so for a month
he'll be a member no matter what he
could choose to renew it or not doesn't
matter
and then Cody just above him Cody cilok
is a mod and he has four stars next to
his name and if I recall correctly four
stars means that you are either a six
month recurring member or a three month
recurring member I don't remember which
one but basically he's been a member a
long time and there are a few like that
so it is appreciated and I hope you guys
feel a little fancier than the average
fella in the chat with those dope little
stars next y'all's names as good as I
can do what else can I do I mean they
have the emoji thing like you know the
badges or no no it's yeah like the
special images that you can use like on
to looking at them yeah I can design you
okay perfect if she's gonna make out
some cool stuff I guess and we can go on
from there I've been meaning to open it
up and like have like people submit
their own designs but and we can add I
think oh yeah we can make a Pepsi mm oh
yes that would be so good where she by
the way
yeah probably chewing on a cable no
she's sleeping there she's being a good
kitty purr once alright okay Kay mr. K F
gaming says it's six months you guys
have been members for six months that is
insane actually KS sorry K F gaming gets
five stars it's a good question I think
it's five stars at one year I'm pretty
sure that was like the minimum I could
again YouTube limits like the time spans
for the next upgrade in the badge so I
think the minimum I could do for the
five star was one year so if you
remember for that long you're gonna be
super senior and it's gonna it's gonna
be the Pentagon five-star style so that
should look again pretty dope of course
no one's like that yet because we just
started enabling the memberships within
six months so and mr. K F gaming I
believe is our first ever channel member
so he'll be that from the beginning
yeah so if he if he makes it all the way
through a year as a member then he'll
get that five-star Pentagon style badge
I guess you could call it but uh it'll
be cool
Jagr nor it asks is Lisa your wife or GF
sometimes you have sometimes wife what
what does that mean sometimes you want
to be my girlfriend bad boy and I'm just
your girl with nothing wow I'm it's fine
Oh Jaime this is really painful to hear
especially in front of so many good
people 239 people are just whatever it's
forever it's done it's over I just heard
you roast me on string they seem scroll
in hey I see ya Jason I see that's good
one
what's going on Mike Mike aces he is new
here I hope you feel welcome really we
really have no agenda ever when we hop
under these live streams we just
interact with a chat as much as we can't
answer questions we try to be cool and
more relaxed I feel like our videos are
pretty Stern and for the most part just
informative so this is a good way to
kind of make it feel more down-to-earth
be a little more human with you guys and
crack up a little bit on the side - you
got so how you say your name you got I
have two monitors plus one TV came to my
PC when I turned the TV power off
Windows 10 still detects and treats the
TV as if it is on I can drag Windows
into it is that normal uh actually I've
never tested that I've never I haven't I
could test it right here I actually
could do that okay I'm gonna turn the
monitor off and I'm gonna slide a window
into it
let's see if it see if it actually does
it does it I think it does yeah you can
just press Windows Aero true I can't
reach the Windows key you trap me all
right
yeah it's done it's gone yeah so if you
don't find your windows you just press
windows and the arrow button Mac and you
will find it back on your contra screen
I had no idea you can do that mm-hmm yes
why you need me so that's normal
no need to feel weird we all experience
it I'm curious they're like how do you
make a video about that how do you know
that like that your TV's off but you can
still track Windows I'd like did you
just try it or is it like it's some
application trying to use all three
screens or whatever the problem is
sometimes when it's used applications
used to open a certain window and you
turn it oh yeah yeah you want to open up
the kitchen thing and you can't see it I
can't see it where is it
I don't just press windows left or right
arrow and you get back to it yeah yeah I
remember that
mm-hmm KF gaming says great do you
remember of the back in the day when you
overclock that Z on twelve-thirty v3 to
match uh 6700 K yes sir I do that was a
fun video hey can't forget you were
going to buy it in 69 50 X 4 it's cool
box this was back when like it was a 10
core beast and I was feeling a little
lucky so I drove to Houston and I went
to Duke I just drove out there well I
think my intentions about there were
just to buy new parts for some builds I
had planned but I ended up wanting to
buy a 69 50 X which is like a $1,500
processor yeah I know the only reason
why I wanted to do it was because I
wanted the black box it was like it was
the only like quartz you know apart from
like the old-school i7 like it was one
of the only CPUs that came in a black
box it said extreme do you know how cool
again thank you I can tell he liked
boxes we went on the cruise he saw a
watch in the box oh that's why he wanted
to have the watch he told me he did
include the box - that's like bro I
think you know dope they were looking
video just because of the bog it was
dope but it was like the nicest watch
box boxes it was a fad Invictus I would
never wear that watch in public it was
bigger than my wrist was but it just
looks so elegant in the ball
to have it in the background already I
would post it right there people be like
take a set maybe oh it's just my watch
no it's just a dog box yeah but I'd have
the box open you know like like a
clamshell I mean the bugs was really
looking dope it was so much good it was
a really nice box let's see here
Co fossa that 128 gigabyte is only fifty
dollars more expensive than the 64
iPhone XR I think I don't think it is is
it I don't think I'm pretty sure it
wasn't it I guess I would have probably
bought the higher storage model if it
was I what storage I have I'm not sure I
mean yeah I I really don't I don't
recall it ever being 50 bucks more it's
always been traditionally with Apple 140
64 yeah I know you did but like if you
if you pull up like type in iPhone when
XR 128 gig and just see how much it
costs what was yours 800 yeah it was 800
cuz we got Apple care with it so another
120 dollars yeah and then it was
thousand no it was oh maybe with tax I'm
sure it was the freaking crap ton of
money that's what it was
that's that's shown 800 no but that's
you gotta go to Apple's website and then
just oh wait and then just like price
you're gonna buy and then just pry it
likes price it out like spec wise and
just see ya
I'm just see what it what it what it do
cuban legend it's like when you have
multiple monitors and you enter a
condition where the monitors went form
extended to one display at times the
windows can be a lost outside of the
single display in like the ether exactly
and then you're like where the heck is
my window yeah you like
control-alt-delete like entering that
task manager and it's showing that the
program is running if you're like where
is it I know that feeling I spent a
while trying to figure out where one of
mine was I think it was I think with
stream labs actually kept opening up but
I couldn't find it and turns out it was
thinking I was connected to her second
display that I had previously unplugged
it wasn't even plugged in and stream
lines were still defaulting to the to
the second secondary display and I could
never get it to pop back up on to the
first display and unless like
reinstalled and uninstalled and
reinstalled you know it's just fifty
bucks more why didn't we do that no cuz
I didn't pay seven forty nine for your
phone they $7.99 I paid a hundred bucks
for it I know I did cuz an Apple care
was a hundred or one twenty and then
taxes brought it almost right up to
maybe they dropped it a thousand bucks
like Friday and we ordered it like we
got screwed over basically I mean to
paying more than we were supposed to
yeah we should have waited anyway yeah I
wanted to get me as fast as possible
because I my my iPhone from Germany
won't work here with all the cell
service that's why I need a one that
keeps saying it will still love his
channel even if I never read my even if
he never reads my question Zach asked
the question and stop complaining that
I'm not answering your question and then
maybe I will answer it I can't I haven't
even found your question unless I'm
being trolled if I'm being trolled than
there's a problem but I have not I
haven't seen this question anyway
okay retype the question I think it's
written I think it's a really good troll
I see Bo says yes Greg Stream Labs was
doing the same for me had to uninstall
and reinstall boom see how it wasn't the
only one Stream labs does that it's like
messing with us that's okay it's like
survival of the fittest and trying to
rule us out you know the dumb ones
you're just gonna quit not always a
solution
yep let's see you guys says Apple
dropped prices but if it's only 14 days
you can return for free now this if she
bought it already it was about to go in
the garden yeah anyway Jason Zack don't
steal your mom's credit
Zack you stole and ask your question he
says I'm not trolling I swear okay I'm
looking so you can ask it now hey long
time benefit channel question though I
thought I just bought a GTX 1080 41 -
and I'm really hoping my TMX 460 was
powerful
80 plus cool you didn't tell me what
your CPU is so I don't know I mean if
you're running like a 69 50 X
overclocked then you're gonna be pushing
the limit no not really still probably
wouldn't push up lemon 650 watt for a
normal conventional let's say you have
an 87 hundred K or 2700 X that's enough
power for that no problem Billy asked
Lisa and Greg what are your favorite
songs oh thanks for the great content
appreciate that Oh what the depends you
start it depends on no know favorite
song from your favorite band all
breaking the habit from Lincoln Park I
need yeah yeah yeah I don't know that
song and then mine would have to be
Breaking Benjamin something which song
yeah I don't know which you always told
me diary if Jane was you like that one
morning then it's with the devil but
diary of Jane is like the de-facto
answer I can't I can't say that song cuz
it's just so obvious it's gotta be
something different something you know
what song I really like I told you that
song the song called you fight me from
Breaking Benjamin sounds like nothing
else they've ever written before and you
and I really like it cuz it's just like
wow they're actually like doing this
it's it's so unconventional for them
really liked it I really did
I must every time it comes on I'm like
oh yeah oh yeah I'd approach I think
that's uh I think that's probably my my
song a choice yeah good question
it's very thought-provoking I'm gonna
answer some questions which one what are
your thoughts about aces still being on
AG sir please don't you say that yeah
one 100 to 470 platform I haven't looked
too far into it I haven't reviewed I
don't even think I have an extra seventy
board from a Seuss but I've read a few I
believe they're not a do wander a little
bit on reddit and I have read a few
posts regarding that and how to help
it's an issue but I haven't seen it
firsthand play out so I don't know for
sure if it's something I'm ever gonna
actually get into first hands first hand
breaking measurement of water but I
would have to read more about
specifically that platform really don't
know too much about it because again I
haven't really dabbled with that board
hands-on or with any actually any Asus X
470 board I don't think I have any
issues AMD board period I think all my
issues I think all my Asus boards are
Intel boards I'm pretty sure like if I
went in there right now like I'm pretty
sure they're all yeah yeah yeah I'm
pretty sure than have to change them
yeah let's
rip Chester of Linkin Park he spelled it
wrong bro Jason you spelled it Lincoln
like the real Lincoln Oh didn't I read
like a story or an article a long time
ago saying that they originally called
it Lincoln with Ellen yeah because there
wasn't hoppy right right there was from
the part they went to the park actually
and they didn't it was like oh like a
park you can walk in you know no there's
a really important and take this name
actually that was there yeah I think I
think they weren't able to for some
reason yeah and that's why they they
just they're like screw it
they just like intentionally misspelled
it yeah yeah which is really funny
that's kind of rebellious I see the
conquer 269 1080 1440p higher settings
yeah depends on the framerate but yeah I
have videos talking about this see my
1070 TI benchmarks we test in 1440p
it'll answer your question in more
detail oh my name is chick another
member we got our notable all right all
right my name is chick you guys you got
a comment now
in the chat so we can see your beautiful
star next to your name we got it is
gonna look so good I'm gonna see it it's
always the way to buy it yeah it'll
float in there eventually
Derek's a via worst motherboard you ever
reviewed oh I'd have to go way back and
check yeah I haven't reviewed too many
motherboards recently we just did that
one from gigabyte it's not really a bad
review it's just a cheaper board so it
comes with more compromise people
thought I was ripping on that board but
like it's a cheap board what do you
expect you know like I'm not gonna I'm
not gonna treat it differently than all
my other motherboard reviews just
because it's cheap like I am going to
treat them all the same even the most
expensive ones will be out of the same
standards people were like oh of course
it doesn't overclock that's not a con
but it is when seen in the context of
how cheap and affordable be 350 boards
are as well hey 320 you can overclock
could be 350 acam it comes to Rison so
that was something I pointed out
apparently that's like that's a no-no I
don't make a few people said that but
still kind of like I didn't really
understand that that logic but then guy
asks you
mmm-hmm what part of Germany did you
grow up and I am I'm left closed I grew
up at close to Stuttgart
maybe Stuckart is a name that people can
notice because there's like poor she and
everything I think boys know that oh
yeah but I'm actually really done from
the south I'm close to this with a
border so I could actually walk to
Switzerland in maybe 30 minutes walking
distance I'm a bit long but yeah Switzer
boy Swiss borders wits wit support oh
yeah he spits is border the Swiss border
he Switzer yeah I think it's cute how
you talk bit me it's cute is it cute
sometimes she's like what's the real
word and I'll just throw her completely
I'll throw a curveball and she won't see
coming and she'll just roll with it and
she'll sound a little silly for a little
while well I will look forward and he
knows exactly what I wanted to say you
won't let help me out with it and I'm
like tell me what is it what is it it's
so great it's so great and I try to even
try to find different worth they would
describe it somehow I didn't say it was
worth it it's always worth it that's
okay I couldn't I mean you can speak the
languages that you speak like most of us
can only speak one especially in America
we speak English because we expect
everyone else will speak English yeah
but I mean I see it why Americans don't
feel like learning other language
because everyone learns English yeah
doesn't speak English
learns it in school it's still in my
opinion it's still closed minded though
like if you're gonna travel anywhere
else on the planet that doesn't natively
speak English they're gonna speak in
their native tongue and you're gonna
want to adapt to them because it's their
country so you know like that's why
whenever I talk to you about like
Germany and how most Germans speak
German even though you say that half of
them or so can speak English too
the fact is that like most Germans still
choose to speak German and so even
though I know I could still communicate
with roughly half of them
I still feel slightly uncomfortable
talking in English because they have to
go out of their way in a sense
switch languages to talk to just me and
then switch back to German to talk to
everyone else like when we go out to eat
remember like that one wait that
waitress spoke both languages but like I
didn't want to talk because I wasn't
even sure first off if she even spoke
English cuz then that would be really
awkward but then she spoke English and
then she had to switch right back to
German when like you're your mom or
somebody would ask a question and it
just makes me feel like like she
shouldn't have to go out of her way to
notice we like to do that it's fine
actually people like to use the language
when they have to yeah and you have to
see the different way what is this
German will be the world language
instead of English would you still
choose to us speak English down in your
home country you would it's the same way
the same way you see it yeah just have
to you know I mean I don't blame them
for speaking for choosing to speak
German that's like I expect that like I
didn't even know that half of them could
speak English but but that's the whole
thing like it doesn't to me it's still I
I just feel uncomfortable in my own
right because I haven't taken the
initiative to learn the language that in
most people or all people in Germany
speak the one language they all speak no
matter what right so and now that we're
married like I know I need to get I need
to get on that train because I hate
having to use you as a translator for
for your mom I don't like having to talk
through you to her when we could just
like yeah it would be so much better you
know everybody in your kids I can talk
to them German in ten years what I'm
still like 70 right yeah yeah can you
see that yeah I thought I can totally
see it
mm-hmm you look younger than your age
fucking Thanks
can we ask a question can we ask
everyone to guess you ask how old do you
think she is you can say the truth I'm
not gonna just tell the truth she can
take it she's strong she's she doesn't
me she's got the oh yeah maybe I have to
leave the room but it's okay I thought
you were I thought you were around my
age
honestly and
then when I found out because that's why
I knew I never asked the question
because I had just I just thought
inherently that you were gonna be I
don't want to say the age cuz I'm gonna
ruin that but you know I thought you're
gonna be around my age and then I found
out you were actually older than me and
by oh you said but they have to know my
age to like only a few of the know my
village so then you know no we're
already seeing it rolling 27:22 18 25 25
26 27 be pepper says 75 17 oh that's so
good I see a lot of leg I see a lot of
mid-20s like a lot of people are
guessing 27 some of them probably know
your age Luke W says 42 they're in the
ballpark there is nothing to be ashamed
of right now right now though alright
now when do you tell me other bad
sumbitch I'm just joking I'm Joe I'm
Jimmy no flowers no I'm Jack I know I
gotta get more flowers no yeah I have to
get alot flowers see this is the moment
when I'm only the girlfriend I feel like
my sarcasm is a little too brash

27 thanks for that newsela about our
super chat victress hope all is going
well with your family my dude and 27 is
right on the money she is 27 a lot of
you guessed it a lot of you guessed it
right on some of you were saying 26 24
27 I really thought he was my age when I
met him so I was also never I never
asked yeah two of it you say I think we
spend like one month or something
together until we figure it out though
that I'm older than him no yeah so you
by the way Cody spam in the discord link
please join the discord that is a public
it's free to join and it's shared by
Brian over at Tech yes City so if you
guys want to
get a little more involved the
conversation and tech space and
everything else under the Sun basically
we also play games together over there
we'll join the chat and we'll talk and
ball up on like pub G and stuff and you
can do that click the link below and
just now that we get involved yeah we're
gonna start with pop G soon again we're
gonna pug you like tonight no I'm not
tonight but we're gonna so maybe next
week we can start next next Sunday with
custom matches again okay sounds good
everybody gets ready for pop G pop G no
matter if you have played it before or
not um yeah just don't suck or you're
gonna be on the others yeah but it's
good okay it's not as imply for a big
while I'm a baller yo ya'll home mess
with me you give me a sniper rifle and
it's over probably for me I suck with
snipers I'm pretty good though with like
an m4 but he's not good with a ton for
even the m16 surprisingly great at long
range I people yeah just don't play
normal games with him Hey he won't help
you yeah you know I'm very selfish Luke
W asking what the Mac save temperatures
are or excuse me max AV core 487 okay
it's literally in their manual if you
want to look there Luke they actually
talk about like what the safe voltage
threshold is for skylake but our that's
kind of a coffee like but I believe it's
in the realm I think their limit is like
1.5 but I would not go a millivolt over
one point for like that's about the
limit for me and at that point if you're
running at 1.4 and you're not deluded
you're gonna be really pumping out some
heat so you have to play it kind of safe
feel it out every trips gonna be
different of course but you'll have to
kind of space it out let's see here but
think again by the thing Greg I'm
waiting for her to itzkoff head yeah
cuphead and Damas slap you know a slap
on the back head increases your brain
you know now no oh no you know see what
no one is bred it increases the brain
pressure that's what you say you never
you never heard that
someone's asking how old I am I'm 24
Kofa has all the answers it looks like
he actually knows but I'm sorry ah see
Dickens just like some how do you say in
hairstyles for you because I'm gonna
going to do the same hairstyle I always
anyway Nimbus asks how do I feel about
rising 7 7 7 nanometre I have a video
talking about that just type in risin 7
nanometre science studio and again that
video is up there just for that specific
question I invite you to check out when
I let me know what you think Jason
Acevedo 5 Alec Canadian I was playing
Resident Evil 4 and realized he had the
same last name as a villain Roman Salva
oh we have to now I remember because
Leon Leon's a main character right he'll
walk in and he'll see the little boy a
little boy's name was yeah he was part
of the salad event you know he was
always like so bizarre I thought that
was so cool I would I would purposely
not save the game and I would just
replay that scene so I could show my
whole family to talk we don't have a
last name that's very common here so
it's well at least in this part of the
country so it's just like you know if
you hear it it's kind of surprising and
cool like if you heard I mean iris of
the Caribbean the last part is in German
called yeah that's all we don't have
yeah but you don't call it English title
was different here's I thought that was
really weird and know that different
well I guess in China they do that some
somewhat I know it like different
countries have different like viewing
dates for movies and stuff but I know
they call them different things over
there of course is it the language
barrier like it doesn't translate the
same or is it just like they're just
like screw it we're gonna ours was I
think it was dead men tell no tales and
then you guys called his Salazar's
revenge
only if we would translate that it would
be such a huge title yeah that's why we
call him by the name okay instead of
what he actually is yeah that's
interesting German like super big see I
did not know
that uh I didn't no no that's a code
Cody's asking for an appraisal let's see
FX 8350 16 gigs of ram R X 480 256 gig
SSD 2 terabyte hard drive 240 oh all
right so I'm gonna break it down for you
Cody this is what I would pay if I was
buying your system outright or would I
be comfortable paying FX 8350 plus the
motherboard I'd pay 40 bucks for the
pair honestly 16 gigs of ddr3 for that
platform 100 bucks
so we're at 140 our X 480 I'd pay you
that's a 8 gig I'd pay used I'd pay
about 150 for that maybe a little more
let's say 160 so we can make it an even
300 and then 256gb SSD that's 50 bucks 2
terabyte hard drive 50 bucks so a
hundred bucks there so four hundred
dollars and then 240 a IO you know you
can put it I mean I'm sure you pay close
to 100 bucks for that but used I'd
probably pitch you 60 bucks if that
maybe closer to 40 but I'd have to feel
you out so it'd be I'd really shoot for
a solid $400 but I know that's gonna be
less than you'd take so we probably have
to settle closer to 460 or 480 I'm sure
you'd want about 500 if you were
reasonable I'd say you'd probably put up
there for about 500 bucks but I would I
would start closer to 400
that's my breakdown you don't have to
agree with it but that's that's what I
would that's what I would ask if I was
trying to sell something similar but
Zynga wants to pay $200 for a Marine
haircut you know when I was in the Air
Force Academy and they and they they
straight up down to the scalp on those
is that what it is yeah it's like yeah
all the way so you're just all the way
yeah I saw pictures I didn't like that
but for 200 bucks would you do that no
I'm not that cheap have to make it a
solid solid - jeez Oh grand yeah yeah I
do ever - it grows back coming come on
it's not that point do agree yeah what
bazinga we still didn't had their date
night yet
so I have to go with him with this
haircut to the date night then I know
you now you want me are you making me
just shaving just to just to spite you
walk around me everywhere baby I had a
short haircut for a long time when I
came back aha
you know I just alright if you do it I
do it too
you wouldn't do that I do know you would
do jeez do it to grant no I'd have to
pay you 20 grand and do it then I then I
would say it's okay you would have my
kid at 20 grand you would have my
blessing do you play Rainbow six siege
Lisa um yeah I used to play it in the
beginning when they released it but I
haven't played it like since a year no I

Cheetos are oh what a Cheetos I just see
cheese it's all over and I know she's
it's are the bomb net but Cheetos are
the bomb calm all right what is that is
is the same thing
no they crack us with cheese Cheetos are
like they're like Airy

puffy kind and we have to do
there's Cheetos there's cheese puffs but
the reddest want the fire oh yeah yeah I

except not fiery but yeah that's a can
we be sponsored by Cheetos I don't know
let's see I saw okay that was it right
there
ah my name is chick he's the guy who
just I think it just became it's kind of
confusing you're you are you a dude or a
chick cuz you said my name is chick
it's chick chicks a guy's name right
chick chick chick fil-a yeah I'm I don't
know I don't have to think right now but
anyway appreciate a super chat my dude
assuming you're a dude I will never
forget when McLovin told one of the
Micra said our employees he was an Xbox
one player have you seen that you've
seen that right yeah brother I didn't
know back down what she does loss oh
gosh
do you watch the power yeah every now
and then I watch some of this videos we
met there Bauer I know in Vegas yeah and
yeah I'm not only in Vegas and we met
him first and compute X no we met him we
met him in Vegas first I think we met
him again we saw him again economy tax I
think maybe you're right uh let's see
here look what's the recommended
radiator fan speed I have a VW Polo TDI
I don't know what you recommend rate of
your fan speed is because uh I don't
know what your current temps are just
say 500 500 500 rpm PWM that thing was
it a good number no not really it's
gonna run pretty hot go fasta what's the
biggest amount of money you've got in a
super chat or donation i think super
chat bazinga donated like a hundred
bucks yeah ton of money and next week
you're gonna maybe I don't know if the
zingers actually say doing what he said
but yeah so we'll get another hundred
dollars from bazinga I'm gonna write you
in but
whispers I'm just kidding but yeah
anyway pie to the face that's $100
apparently throw I'll take it cuz that's
like that's like 4 bucks and raw
materials and like what 10 bucks and
labor I think I would have done it for
20 but gosh what are your thoughts on
tech support scams I've been victims of
those I think you just got to be
diligent and I think they're gonna I
mean people are falling for him that's
why they keep doing them but I you gotta
know your stuff you know know when
something sounds fishy
you should probably dive into that a
little more especially when they do
those like sharing the screen scams it's
so I remember the barnak Uli's a
barnacle ease binoculars good guard
partner please today a video or he he
filmed himself being scammed like a tech
support tech support guy like was
scamming him and what they do is they
tell you like they should they get you
to share your screen right so they have
access to your screen and that this is
just one way to do it and then they tell
you to type in your credit card
information like an hour later right but
you're supposed to forget that the
screen is actually being so then they
see you in - yeah it seems like that so
then they see you enter all your crap
and then they rip offense super nicly
was entering like just BS numbers like
like I don't here's it's not the right
number you know some I think it sounded
Indian I'm not sure but it was really
really funny people fall for yeah they
phone oh yeah yeah let's see a run Boff
divert oh it's a one month member all
right that is nope I can't tell if
you're a guy or a girl but I'm assuming
your guy and say thank you for being a
member I like that star next Jam looking
pretty sexy and we see the question here
any idea how to troubleshoot a pwm fan
that doesn't respond to the pwm signal
it works on DC mode but PWM mode it goes
full speed that could be the motherboard
though it might not be the fan to check
you have to swap it with another PWM fan
and see if it does the same thing so you
can confirm you can have to take that
fan that you are having issues with pop
it into another system that's also got a
PWM hub and
see if that fan is able to be controlled
by a PWM if it runs full speed then it's
probably the fan controller itself but
if it what is she what is she doing it
anyway yeah you should have troubleshoot
that way just part swap I think she's
like ripping the shower curtain in the
other bathroom you might want to Mona go
check on that she's just being a cat
anyway bazinga
I don't like I keep my word as soon as
the pie hits the face I hold Tony to 105
this would be good I'm sure she'll enjoy
that one
Jacob Stoker says so that's a no on the
dab that's right sir I will not dab on
live I'm I'm expensive want to say hi
alright alright she's gonna get lit now
her tails like right in the calf
oh gosh uh let's see alias asks are you
a boy or a girl are you talking to me
I assume talking to me right my long
beautiful locks you really hurt my
feelings but you gave me five dollars
so I feel slightly more inclined that's
okay are we gonna cut your hair honey
I know I look like Beavis Beavis and
Butthead
don't you guys think he looks like
beavis and butt-head what to block out
quiche OS we play block out what is that
I'll go yeah I don't know what it is leg
out I'm gonna block out huh no we PI
boggle we do we play boggle long do you
guys know boggle that's like a game you
have to find English words as fast as
possible on this often do they know that
does everybody know that I didn't know
most Americans so so I played against
him right and I've beaten twice I felt
so good just I just wanted to mention
this and I thought this is the right
moment I know why Elias that's what I
was boy or girl or a viewer boy or girl
oh baby ask me I don't know I don't know
but he I think he asked it because I was
I wasn't sure if they were guys or girls
when I was reading the chat
remember that oh because I'm looking at
like profile pictures that have like
letters for their like like Jade and
Harper hedges the J next to his name so
I can't tell most of you guys have like
random pictures next year and obviously
that's confusing let's see guy and I
live in PCB work at Tyndall fan came in
a 3-pack from Lee and Lee with the O 11
others work find that fan plug others
worked fine on that fan plug but the fan
does it on all slots okay
yeah I would still just double check I
know that's pretty much isolated but I
would still double check make sure that
fan doesn't or make sure it runs full
speed in another system another
motherboard it could just be that
particular fan not gelling well with
that BIOS which would be weird because
if the other fans work fine then yeah 9
out of 10 times it's the fan and it
probably isn't your case to but I would
just if you had a better computer laying
around you work at Tyndall I'm sure you
do I would just just just check just to
see that was like the lamest thing okay
my name is chicks with bobble do you
know yeah they know boggle know I get it
a ladies I'm sorry or alyas Elliott I
think it's aliens yeah I totally missed
that joke up front that's why I kind of
just I've worded it over to me but I get
I get it now I get it
I'm a little slow sometimes I identify
as a Lancia Delta Integrale a rally car
I know exactly what car that oh no it's
this profile picture yeah the only
reason I know what a Lancia is is
because I played Gran Turismo like a lot
not just this one I used to play Gran
Turismo growing up like hardcore on the
PlayStation 4 interesting 1 2 3 &amp;amp; 4
yeah he would sit there and play and
play yeah and yeah I have to sneak
underneath on the car pant to pass
otherwise he would screw his lap want
some water yeah she want some water
that's again oh all you want just that
tang a little bit umm she wants a little
more oh you have to put it there
actually she like pushes her nose into
it
hmm she's trying to see if it's a she's
dripping all over the phone she's trying
to see it's water-resistant room yeah
it's fine why why does she not drink her
own water in her Bowl no just the
creative musician end of me we adopt you
already crimson yeah crimson you're we
just wanted to add buzina in the family
Yeah right
is that cool with you present at school
is seeing us becoming your brother right
are not asking about checking his V
cores actual V Corps if you overclock
your a just 8086 K to 5 gigahertz with
one point V one perfectly stable the
hardw info is saying upwards of 1.4 you
still might if you have a fixed voltage
and it shouldn't go any higher than that
unless you have something like
multi-core enhancements still enabled
which I'm not sure if you can still
overclock with MCU enabled but that
might be a reason why your voltage is
still being bumped because your BIOS is
pushing it up unless your V core is
still locked to auto in which case you
biases are almost always gonna push more
voltage than necessary to attain that
frequency so I would check I you know
double check with other software as well
it might just be hardware info telling
you something different double check
with like hardware monitor or CPU Z I
think does the CPC tell voltages I don't
remember but uh yeah I'm trying to think
of all the ones that I use for that kind
of stuff I use CPU Z when I'm looking at
frequencies I always confirm them with
hardware monitor and then I use hardware
monitor for temps so a lot of mixed ones
there let's see here I want to what
camera would you recommend for vlogs
good question camera to recommend for
vlogs Nara na Nara ah Erik Nara
Erik somewhere is him no no Nara Nara
yeah ok no that's a cool name action
yeah it sounds like a girl what camera
would you recommend for vlogs that
camera would be uh I like the g85 it's
my B roll camera
really cleans a light small camera
mirrorless and if you can get the kit
lens with it it's usually fine
Pepsi what do you what are you doing
Shoji 85 is a good starting point if you
want like a fixed lens and something
like an FC 1000s C 300 I think other
fixed lens Panasonic Panasonic
derivatives that are cheaper but I would
recommend something with a removable
lens just because you can swap them out
you can change your aperture all that
stuff have a wider wider array of shots
to make if you invest in lenses in the
future so I think G 85 is a pretty sweet
pretty sweet point let's see so for you
two lovebirds is there a day set in
stone yet we're already married so I
don't know so we're married yeah by
weird since we don't have a day for the
actual wedding where we gonna have fun
yeah we wait to live but because of the
hurricane and everything likes going on
so we yeah I mean push it I love it yeah
the wedding is like it's still gonna be

it near the beach here would be really
nice and you like the beach and stuff
but I think it likes the beach I think a
winter themed wedding would be kind of
doing yeah I like the winter themed
wedding yeah but that's expensive so no
yeah
bazinga says he's older than both of us
