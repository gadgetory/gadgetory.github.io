synchronous dynamic random access memory
say that instead of ddr4 from now on and
you'll sound like one cool cat it's the
RAM required by x99 and most z170
chipsets along with the up-and-coming
a.m. for platform from AMD we've been
told time and time again that eight
gigabytes is the bare minimum for modern
gaming and that sixteen gigabytes is
beginning to take hold as the standard
presumably anything less than eight
gigabytes results in stuttering induced
lag and sharp decreases in frame rates
let's find out how much you actually do
need and on a platform that's neither
outrageously overpriced nor over
balanced
Walter White stepping up to the plate
again this weekend
he's packing an i7 6700 K overclocked to
4.4 gigahertz an asus strix rog gtx 1070
running at stock out of the box and 16
gigabytes and for 4 gigabyte modules of
ddr4 clock to 3200 megahertz for these
tests the only changing variable that's
kind of a written thing changing
variable the only variable was the
amount of RAM installed that's it we're
ready to go let's start off with city
skylines I always repeat this because
some may be new to the scene but cities
is one of those CPU intensive titles it
will utilize as many threads as you
throw at it verified right here so I
expected in this case that memory
increases would make a substantial
difference they did not at 1440p even
four gigabytes of memory yielded very
playable frame rates no stuttering in a
minimum that blended in with the other
two scenarios and as for the difference
between 8 and 16 gigabytes no change
worth noting dropping the resolution to
1080p yielded much of the same so even
when the CPU is being heavily taxed
available SDRAM in this case makes
virtually no difference when it comes to
frame rates for this game now let's see
if this trend continues GTA 5 an
excellent blend of GPU and CPU intensive
scenes reveals much of the same the
difference between 8 and 16 gigabytes is
negligible and we only saw 25% reduction
at 4 gigabytes but while our average and
maximum was on par and frequent
stuttering occurred resulting in a
minimum of 0 according to both fraps and
the in-game benchmark lowering the
resolution to 1080p revamped the story
though and across the board 4 gigabytes
was acceptable not recommended but still
acceptable I should also note in this
scenario that 16 gigabytes pulled away
slightly from the 8 gigabyte run as a
consequence of the higher framerate
Witcher 3 is much like GTA 5 but on
steroids everything in this game is what
GTA 5 would be if options like hair
works were made available but get this
running the ultra preset even four
gigabytes was enough for steady gameplay
at one point the game froze resulting in
the 0 you're seeing at the bottom but
for a majority of the tests I honestly
couldn't see a difference if we're
focusing solely on the averages we'd be
hard-pressed to discern between the
three oddly enough
at 1080p identical story average margins
were the same and I kid you not at the
exact same point in the benchmark the
game locked up for a brief second during
the 4 gigabyte run being that Ram
available
was the only variable here it makes
sense to conclude that this was the
cause
total war Warhammer which taxes the heck
out of a single CPU core yielded results
that were all within the margin of error
and this blew my mind I honestly
expected Ram amounts to make a
difference here it's very likely that
since only one core is being heavily
used many of the memory intensive scenes
were being delegated to the graphics
card not system Ram the story was nearly
identical once again in 1080p the last
game I tested was Forza Motorsport 6
apex it's in beta currently it could be
downloaded via the Microsoft Store for
free so check it out if you haven't
already I tested this one because I knew
Walter White could shell out some
serious frames and I wanted to see if
that made any more of a difference
between the three scenarios however I
was just a point to define out that
according to Microsoft four gigabytes of
system ram simply wouldn't cut it for
port so I find this difficult to believe
if it's enough for Witcher 3 and we're
pushing over 200 frames per second in
1440p for four to six four gigabytes
would likely be more than enough perhaps
they'll relax the constraints once the
official game releases now if you're
shocked by these results don't worry you
aren't alone I actually ran all of my
Witcher 3 and City skylines tests to
ensure that these frame rates were
consistent I honestly just didn't
believe them the first time around I
also lowered in game settings only to
find much of the same higher frame rates
across the board but no marginal
increases between 4 gigabytes and say 8
at this point really 16 gigabytes seems
like a complete waste of time save a few
games like Ark survival evolved
erroneously dumped tons of data into
system memory by default I didn't
purchase Ark because many have recently
complained about the addition of paid
DLC introduction on a pre-release which
I think is stupid but even so unless Ark
is the only game you play managing with
8 gigabytes will more than suffice
currently now if you're into content
creation by all means opt for 16
gigabytes I see that is the bare minimum
actually for content creation especially
in 4k but if you're only into future
proofing your gaming PC I don't really
see that making much sense now future
proofing has been just thrown around a
lot lately and it's just kind of like
well it's peace of mind I don't have to
worry about upgrading my computer
anytime soon but upgrading RAM takes
about 15 seconds to do I mean upgrading
from 8 to 16 assume you have 4 slots and
two of them are occupied literally just
requires you to pop the slot open and
insert two more modules that's it if
you're if you want to pay more upfront
go ahead but
veidt's according to these results we've
just seen is more than enough for modern
gaming my logic behind this is that
since four gigabytes still resulted in
relatively smooth gameplay save the one
game that refused to open we've got a
long way to go before eight gigabytes
begins acting like four gigabytes is
currently it's your rig so by all means
do what you want but if I was in your
position personally and all I did was
play video games on my PC I would only
purchase eight gigabytes of RAM take the
save money and reinvest it in something
like an SSD which would make a huge
difference in boot times load times
pretty much everything take it from a
guy who used to only use a harddrive
night and day difference if you liked

up give it a thumbs down if you do feel
