post right now
give me a momento ignore Pepsi in the
background doing god-knows-what
what are you doing what are you doing
well what's your remote huh I should
point out that she she wasn't doing this
like ten seconds ago so it's just
something she's doing for the camera yes
all right
I'm making that Twitter post now we are
live giving away two thousand dollars in
tech for new eggs fantastic sale in case
you were mispronouncing that fantastic
get it fantastic it's playing Words okay
all right I feel like I don't need to
I'm gonna click the tweet button and we
are good to go folks
all right how does it sound how does it
sound we sounded good
oh I'm coming through my own speakers
that's awkward how we doing I just want
to make sure that the audio is fine
before we dive into this you can see I
already have the new egg wish list ale
sales up here so this is a wish list I
put together myself I want to emphasize
that this by no means was paid for by
any of the company you're gonna see here
this is a new egg sponsored livestream
meaning new egg said hey we want to
throw some money at you you can do
whatever you want with it and we want
you to promote our fantastic sale so I
said let's go ahead and just give a ton
of money away to our viewers and you're
gonna see throughout this livestream
many giveaways and you can actually join
by clicking the link down below there's
actually a few links down there one of
the links takes you to the page you're
seeing right here and that's the
fantastic sale wish lists when I put
together again but none of these
companies again have paid me any money
to show any of the products you're
seeing here in fact a lot of companies
aren't even include in this list I just
found deals that were actually still in
stock because it Steel's been going on
for an entire day at this point and so
yeah now that we have the fine details
out of the way you can find again the
swish list in the description you can
find the
the enter giveaway link we're using a
website called Rafflecopter its first
time ever used it but apparently it's
pretty simple to do and I think what
we're gonna do because if you look right
here it says that our subtotal of items
it's two thousand seventy one dollars
and for those who are wondering I didn't
say this yet if your country is listed
in the link that is in the video
description that top paragraph there
there's a link at the bottom of that
paragraph and it says countries of
residence eligible for these raffles can
be found here click that link and it
will show you the countries eligible if
you live in one of those countries
you're good to go if you don't live in
one of those countries and you enter
anyway and you happen to win something
you will not win anything instead I will
have to roll that money over into some
future giveaway so don't ruin it for
people who are eligible this is just how
it is okay and I don't want to hurt the
chances of someone else winning if they
actually are in a country that is
eligible so and to be honest I'm
surprised Newegg has this many countries
like it's pretty awesome that they're
able to reach this many actually I might
go ahead and open this up just so I can
show you let's see here
if I do this all right
slide the so over here I'm an in caucus
tin case I do anything stupid
yeah so you see new at global all of
these countries apply there are many and
if you are one of them then you're
eligible to win something and again all
you got to do is click that giveaway
link takes you to Rafflecopter you enter
email address the only thing I'm
requiring from you guys you don't have
to subscribe you don't have to like the
video you don't do anything just
outlandish just send your email and I
only need that so I can email the
winners cuz I would not have a way to
contact you otherwise so that's one
reason I'm even asking for that so this
isn't some data mining thing I'm not
trying to get huge followers or whatever
it's just a fun giveaway that new egg
and science Duty I've decided to put
together for you guys so you want to
thank anybody thank Newegg for making
this happen and yeah so without further
ado let me go ahead and close that one
out and we're gonna start with the first
item now my plan is to give away every
one of these items it comes out to about
a little over two thousand dollars will
dip into science to use budget for the
one dollar difference not a big deal and
the way this is gonna work is so let's
let start with the first one just so you
guys get an idea so this is a risin 530
600 right and I'm showing you a close-up
of the box there yo you guys you guys
you're ruining what the box look like
this is gonna be the first thing I
wanted to show you guys not necessarily
because it's a good deal person it's not
like a discount off the MSRP but it is
in stock and at 200 bucks I think it's a
really compelling offer this is
essentially an 8700 K from Intel but
hyper discounted and you can actually
pair it with some cheaper boards and
still get overclocking support so I
think that I think I have at least one
or two B 450 boards you will need a
small BIOS update more than likely and
you can get dud CPUs from AMD and we've
linked that in past videos but anyway
we're gonna start with this one and not
necessarily because it's like an epic
deal but because it is actually in stock
and it's at MSRP which is pretty awesome
some sites are trying to sell it for a
little more you can fight it here on
Newegg for $199.99 so what we're going
to do is to demonstrate how this will
work I have no idea this is gonna work
well or not Oh actually yeah let's just
try it I do have the giveaway your
raffle thing let's refresh the page so
many people have entered 956 entries oh
right so about a thousand entries and by
the way if you post more than once with
multiple emails we know your IP we know
you're doing it if you multiple if you
multi post you're gonna be disqualified
so don't don't worry ruin it it's gonna
be pretty obvious on our end figure who
did that and we will review these after
we announce the winners so if I find out
that the same person won two different
things from two different email
addresses then that person won't win
anything and will instead give that
money or those products to other people
who entered and will have the list saved
for after the livestream as well so just
a heads up yeah I'm not gonna be able to
manipulate the system sorry about that
okay so I know you can't see what I'm
looking at here but I do have the
entries I don't want to show personal
info this is their personal email
addresses and their names but what I'm
going to do and so and you might see
them in the stream like they might
actually end up chatting like that's me
whatever you know something like that
anyway
I'm going to pick a winner at random all
right and I do that by clicking this one
button here I don't know let's let's
just let's let's
right at a random winner okay the first
winner is Kyle Kyle
H and yeah I got your IP that's another
reason why I don't wanna show this live
but okay cool so I'm going to make a
note of this IP and there's my notepad
so I'm going to jot this name down Kyle
H last name ends in an O in case you're
wondering actually ends in Brobee ro so
I'm gonna write that down gonna make a
note of your IP and you sir have won a
horizon 5 3600 so if your name's Kyle H
and you're in the chat congratulations
that's pretty awesome
it's the first giveaway that's how it's
gonna work we're gonna do one of these
at a time and I'm gonna give it away
right then and there okay so you don't
have to wait till the very end of the
live stream to see who won everything
it's gonna be a progression alright and
bear with me there will likely be
technical issues this is the first time
I've ever done something like this and
I'm not sure if is the first time new
eggs ever been on this side of it either
but hopefully it's entertaining for all
of you guys and look if you don't win by
the way I see I'm peaking just slightly
just a little bit if I'm too quiet then
I'll turn myself back up but anyway if
you don't win I still encourage you guys
to check out these deals there they're
actually some of these deals are really
good they're so good at the point where
I actually bought some of this stuff
some of these drives some of this Ram
that I will show you guys is really
cheap ddr4 right now is really cheap
really compelling fast Ram as well so
we'll get through all that anyway I have
a Kyle HS IP listed here and again this
is how I'm gonna confirm that you're not
double posting so don't double post or
don't double and don't double entry you
know what I mean what I'm trying to say
anyway all right I'm going to meet my
phone so that doesn't happen again and
yeah we're gonna move on so Kyle H wins
the risin 5 3600 cool cool all right
and we're gonna move on to the next
thing ok next thing is this is this is
how you pronounce it in German guile I
think it's how you say it my way
his German so I should know this guy Oh
super loose I don't know how to say that
laughs word they're super loose RGB sync
that's what I've always said I've owned
a gal super loose ddr4 before not these
particular modules these two the RGB
modules but check it out look at $62 now
look folks if you need to pay if you
need a pair of ddr4 dims and you're on
the fence about it you were on the fence
about it because of price and then you
look at this and you say wow Oh
sixty-two dollars I should buy that and
you don't happen to win the giveaway
that we're about to do for this thing
then look pick it up 62 bucks okay and
use our link and give this a small
kickback it's an affiliate link that
would help us out tremendously and it
would tell nuoc that we're doing a good
job promoting this because remember this
is sponsored by Newegg after all and the
reason why we're giving away two
thousand dollars worth of tech is
because of Newegg so do them a solid
shop during the fantastic sale and I
guarantee you won't be disappointed
especially with like ddr4 like this
nineteen sixty-two dollars is a dirt
cheap and check that out look at that
cache timings not the best timings let's
be honest here 16 18 18 s not super good
but you still get nice and fast 3000
megahertz frequencies there so I would
say you know the cast of 16 the timings
are okay they're not super tight but
obviously when you increase frequency
your timings interview up as well you
want to have really tight timings or
really high frequencies preferably both
but I would say this would still be good
for really any modest or semi expensive
Rison or Intel rig and if you're
building a white themed rig and
especially these are gonna look really
good I think the modules I had from
guile were black but but they also had
the RGB strip up top so still look good
I might have even I might have even had
white ones at some point I'm not sure
but they had it was just a blue LED not
the RGB thing you got going on there so
again if you want to find the links to
any of this stuff click in the video
description our wish list link that will
take you to my new egg wish this link my
new egg wish list I should say and that
will give you a heads up of all the
products we're gonna be showing here and
giving away so this is pretty good price
again and I'm gonna stop let's see let's
just click the ddr4 3201 yes he goes way
up and
that's what Brice's used to be so I
would say - and these timings are still
pretty much the same so just slightly
faster your same timings but yeah if you
drop down to 3,000 here you saving 100
bucks I mean that's not technically how
you should look at it but still that's a
really good deal and we're gonna give
this away right now so let's try to yeah
let's do this at a random winner all
right we're gonna click we're gonna
click this again
someone says microphone is resonating
yeah I'm not sure why that's sorry I was
coming through one channel there doesn't
have one point oh yeah I'm not sure
what's why it's resonating that's really
weird it's really weird yeah I mean this
is just something that I hate to say it
I probably got to deal with for the
stream I can't hear it on my own I don't
have headphones actually well in the
closet if it's that bad you guys just
yell at me in all caps but if it's
tolerable we'll just deal with if it's a
live stream and I'll address it later
anyway we're gonna add another winner
here so who's gonna win a pair of guy'll
super lose dims here we go clicking
random winner and that person is
mohammad m and your email address ends
in five eight nine Pepsi is doing
something weird so Mohammed M if that is
you you have just won a pair of super
loose dims from guile and I'd say these
are pretty good so I'm going to do the
same thing I did before open up my
notepad here and we're gonna do the
whole typing in the name thing and
trying not to say names out loud users
kind of tempting to do that while I'm
writing guile that was a super loose DDR
for RGB and I have your IP here so I can
track and make sure we're not getting
double entries
Pepsi she wants to go out let me let her
out real quick you watch she's gonna
walk back in here in about five minutes
okay so I have the IEP down so we're
good to go this is just insurance for
you guys I want to make sure that you
don't double post it keeps it fair for
everybody or double enter I should say
so yeah
look if you didn't win this but you're
still wanting a pair of dims that look
really good and that are really fast for
a great price check this out again click
that wish list link in the video
description and buy yourself a pair I
mean look if you even if you win
something else in this stream you can
still pick up these deals like there's
nothing keeping you from doing that and
there's no telling how long some of
these deals will last so again
yeah there's my there's my plug for
these modules and I can 100% condone
these guy'll modules they are really
reliable and I've had issues with the
pairs that I had and really good price
again alright moving on we have another
I'm actually going backwards here so I
created this list and like it would
stack them as I created them so it
actually kind of backwards anyway I'm
not not gonna freak out or anything
alright so the next thing we're gonna be
given away and we're also gonna showcase
here is the fantex eclipse p3 50x fantex
again none of these companies have any
idea I'm including any of this stuff no
one paid me to do any of this except for
what Newegg is sponsoring for the
giveaways but we have the fantex
eclipse p3 50x here I have reviewed this
in a dedicated video not sure if you
guys have seen that or not but it's
technically around 60 70 bucks most of
the time you can get it now in the
mid-50s USD and I think that is a really
good value for this case get that
integrated RGB check out those RGB lines
it's actually really subtle but it's
enough to where you see it and it
catches your eye like wow it looks
really good
and at the same time so I can get the
mic out of the camera shot there yeah
there we go I'm a little picky I'm
trying to try to do well and the same
time to get that customized customizable
control there we go up top see we get a
shot of that
probably not a yeah there we go that's
cool yeah so you see you get the RGB
integration there and that's really nice
and you get all of it for what 55 bucks
so I think there's
really good deal this is the black
exterior white interior let's see it's a
black one I see the black ones normal 69
bucks you could get it for 60 with a $10
rebate if you want to wait for the
rebate that's cool and all but you can
just get straight up right now $55 case
the peace 50 X more precisely is a
really good case even at 60 or 70 bucks
but at $55 if you want to build an ATX
case or an ATX PC then this is it
airflow it's not too bad either it's not
gonna be the best for airflow but in my
testing it's also not the worst you can
see you got these big side girls on the
left and right that are rather permeable
so it's not too bad all right who's
gonna win a case now let's see yeah I'm
gonna swing on over to our giveaways and
I'm gonna click another random winner
here goes cross the fingers cross things
whatever else we want cross and another
winner is Armando K all right and the
gmail ends in VI n at gmail.com so and
it's not his last name's not Kevin hates
that's what you're wondering
but it's Armando okay and I have your IP
here so Armando if you're watching this
stream you just want a fan text eclipse
p3 50x courtesy of a new egg check that
out and I'm gonna take that in nice so
I'm also going to you know I didn't do
was include the email so I'm gonna type
that in as well for each of these fellas
who wants something okay and do the same
from Mohammed who won me ddr4 off
okay cool and IP that's the other thing
I want to make sure this again is
insurance for you guys make sure that
nobody is double entering and it's fair
for everyone I really like that the
website shows us IP so it's really
convenient I think for the people who
want to track this stuff and then want
to keep it under wraps make sure that
nobody is taking advantage of the system
okay
and this email that way I know who I'm
sending this to good all right make sure
I've spelled that right okay it's also
an archive here so there you go
congratulations Armando you wan yourself
and X clips P through 50 X if you guys
have not won anything so far but you're
interested in some of the stuff you're
seeing here click our affiliate link
down below and get started and shopping
our whistle wish list and yeah does me a
solid and it helps out new as well of
course new egg is sponsoring this entire
video so you can thank them for the
$2,000 worth of tech that we're giving
away and we're gonna move on to the next
thing now not holding back folks all
right what do we have here the B 450 M
now I chose this because it's actually a
pretty decent price now look it's kind
of a bare-bones motherboard I mean let's
be honest here it's not like a
top-of-the-line X 4 70 X 5 70 God like
from MSI right but on a budget this will
do just fine in fact with that 3600 that
that Kyle won this motherboard would in
my opinion be just fine for that it's a
low TDP chip what 65 Watts there abouts
and it's got I would say mediocre power
delivery but for 60 bucks I ain't gonna
complain alright so you guys see what
I'm saying so that is uh that's my
explanation for this it also helps me
keep everything under the $2,000 budget
I'd rather give away more things that
are slightly less valuable than a few
things that are really expensive so I
could have picked an x5 70 board for 300
bucks but I wanted to give you guys more
options more chances to win something
and look I mean it's just something to
get you started
worst case you get this product and you
flip it on Craigslist or Ebay or
whatever I don't care you know it's
whatever but it's an option and if you
are looking to get into a m4 and you
haven't bought a motherboard or CPU yeah
this could get you started so there's
that and six
box I think it's a pretty good deal it's
one of the cheapest be 450 boards I've
seen and yeah so we're gonna be let's
see here sports up to what 3234 66
megahertz ddr4 so that's plenty fine
there and I can see what do we have here
what's where are our ports look like
DVID USB to ps2 ports you guys got them
ps2 ports in there that's a that's a
that's a necessity for some people can
you believe that but it's still a thing
it's still low lately
we got the VGA port as well and an HDMI
ports if you run run something like a
3400 G or a 2400 G not a problem with
this board again you will need a BIOS up
if you want to run Zen to natively but
apart from that I think this will be
plenty for anything around a 65 watt TDP
so yeah I'm not gonna dragging on any
more we're gonna swing back over here to
the giveaway tab and we're gonna be
giving this away so here we go here we
go alright the winner is bump on either
like overlapping music here Caleb a-and
the gmail account ends in ack-ack at
gmail.com Caleb a you are the winner of
the MSI Pro be 450m it's an EM ATX
motherboard I didn't say that earlier so
it's a slightly smaller form factor than
ATX there you go B 450 chipset
I mean mediocre power delivery let's be
honest but still it's gonna get you by
with the 65 watt TDP chips something in
that range and 60 bucks I think is a
really good deal so you guys are looking
for an intro be 450 a motherboard then
this should be one you consider in my
opinion and I got nothing against MSI I
think that these boards are rockin it
just be a little weary of the BIOS
updates some of those are still a little
rough people are having hit or miss
experiences with those so far so if you
have a Zen plus then this would be
perfect for it but you have Zen to and
you're waiting for a stable BIOS might
want to hold up just a little bit all
the Pens you might want to just go with
x57 if you want something now you want
something totally stable and you have
the money for it but we'll see this
one's still plenty so Caleb a
congratulations you have a 1a
MSI motherboard
down the gmail email ha ha write down
that IP just to make sure that you guys
are not double entering mm-hmm I know
what's going on here already someone
asked if it's American only this is not
American only read the description
that's the way I can the descriptions
there for a reason
read that and it will answer your
questions hopefully all right here we go
we're gonna move on to the next thing
and that happens to be an HP x9 20 now I
must confess I do not have any
first-hand experience with this
particular drive from HP maybe a spotty
pass with some SSD some SSDs from them
non lasting too long but in this case
the reviews look good and that's why I
decided to include it I'd be willing to
put my reputation behind it for the most
part and this is a 512 gig PC i3 it's a
4 Lane nvme so that's awesome
and it's only 55 bucks for half a
terabyte I mean it's a really good price
for an nvme Drive so we're going to
let's see I'm going to show you the
reads and writes here check that out
so the reads are really fast up there
toward the top in terms of reads pretty
much maxing out that that interface and
then the rights there okay I mean this
is way better than like an S is like a
SATA SSD right but still I think really
good for the price I do want to
compromise on my rights to this extent
to keep the price under 60 bucks I mean
anything in the $60 price range for a
four-lane nvme is pretty incredible in
my opinion and see Stephen Andrews in
the chat says I have this MDOT to with 1
terabyte and it's fantastic awesome look
I would say just make sure you have
adequate cooling for this put a heatsink
over it something like that make sure
you get at least some passive cooling
going on because well as they pass it I
would put a fan in your case I wouldn't
want this thing heating up to the extent
where it throttles I don't think this is
gonna throttle too hard though and again
most motherboards that have them got 2
ports will have it be something on top
of it that will allow some of that need
to be soaked into that instead of the
drive itself so looking mighty fine here
and again 55 bucks I mean he's gonna I'm
not gonna complain about that so we're
gonna go ahead and give this one away
folks this is I am
moving through here we're gonna click
the add a random winter button and let's
Austin see Austin see is the winner of
the HP ex9 20 m dot 2 app a terabyte
drive congratulations my friend that's
Austin see the email address ends in PE
for Austin C at gmail.com
congratulations Austin see I'm gonna
write your name down see I'm going to
make a note of who won what we have the
C Armando won the fan tax p3 50x Caleb a
won the B 450m motherboard and Austin
see just won the HP ex9 20 px 920 m dot
- that's envy me I'm that - which means
it's gonna be much faster than your
typical SATA MDOT to put that in
parentheses
I don't confuse myself got a nice little
system going on here and Austin sees
email address huh alright and then his
IP so I make sure again I'm gonna say
this every time so no one's like what
were you looking at his IP doing this so
to make sure we don't have double
entries multiple entries from the same
person I should say the same location
and there we go okay
now we're gonna be moving on to the next
thing by the way guys if you're looking
for an app to drive I mean this is it
right here 55 bucks it's one of the
cheapest em got to envy me drives that I
found on on a on nuoc or Amazon for that
matter so Newegg I've noticed has really
your deals when it comes to memory RAM
just storage memory doesn't matter this
is a really compelling price here and
the ratings reflect a pretty solid
product overall so even if you didn't
win this but you're looking for one
click our wish list link down below and
that'll take you to to the wish list
that we're going through right now you
can click on that it's an affiliate link
it gives me a small kickback and it
tells new AG that you appreciate new egg
for having this product up there it's
such a good price and
all right here we go moving on to the
next thing this is actually a monitor I
didn't expect to be giving away too many
monitors this is the only one actually
in the list I'm pretty sure the reason
why I chose it first off it's a hundred
and ninety bucks so that's come on
that's that's cheap right I mean one
second here okay so I had let's see like
my brothers likes prank alone or
something what that's right no what was
this is the Septor see 275 beat now I
must confess I do not have first-hand
experience with this particular monitor
but it's got pretty good reviews on
Amazon especially for the price it's a
budget monitor like look it's a TN panel
it's not gonna be back great response
times are okay for this price point here
5 millisecond response time shouldn't
see too much ghosting although I can't
speak from firsthand experience here but
I can't say that that refresh rate and
that resolution is pretty baller for the
price so this is a 144 Hertz gaming
panel it is actually a curved panels I'm
not sure if it's a 1800 R or if it's
3,000 RI let's see if they listed it -
you're not seeing the curve ratio oh
yeah I don't see it there anyway you're
the specs so pretty decent viewing
angles for the technology and be
freesync compatible other it is
curvature radius 1800 are there you know
pretty uh I'd say that's the industry
standard for this kind of stuff and
decent brightness dynamic contrast this
kind of stuff I would usually typically
grain of salt it's gonna look different
in person for it really every panel
including those from the same
manufacturer but that you get that 144
Hertz refresh rate and well that's
that's the fruit of course fresh way but
anyway I think is a good modern for the
price what can I say here so yeah
someone said you have your mouse right
over it yeah I know I'm trying to do
like 10 things at once I'm sorry I found
it though I found it beyond gaming AMD
freesync 144 Hertz refresh rate yes C 3
millisecond response time here so that's
kind of reduced uh I'm wondering if this
one's true if the one knew I had some
industry but either way it's it's not
going to be the best not gonna be one
millisecond but it's going to be decent
and
yeah all right not gonna drag this one
out too much more let's see what do we
have port wise do we have a port
selection your end curious about that we
have one HDMI that supports 144 Hertz
and then the second HDMI supports 120
and then we have one display for it of
course that'll support 144 right so HDMI
or DisplayPort is good with this panel
that's good to know for whatever wins
this case you're wondering you do also
get a $5 promotional credit card our
gift card with purchase that's not
really like a huge dent in the price but
the price is already super competitive
the inlet so yeah and look even if this
wasn't like I should disclose this just
because I'm showing it here it doesn't
necessarily mean that it's like a deal
that's unique to only fantastic sale
right so it's not just sometimes you
might find this like outside of new eggs
fantastic sale for 190 bucks right so
I'm not saying it's a fantastic sale
exclusive it might be I don't know for
sure but I know that the price is really
good as is so if I include it
yeah I'm just picking it because I
happen to find a product that I thought
was a decent deal that would interest
you guys all right yeah we got swing
over here to random winner licking it
now
and we have Greg W it's a good name Greg
it's a good name Greg W the email ends
in X sorry Oh X 1 at yahoo.com if that
is you Greg then you my friend have one
yourself except acceptor 275 B monitor
Oh
huh that's the monitor see 275 be right
the email address down it so I can email
you after the live stream and it's gonna
be a lot of emails here I didn't really
think that through and then we got the
IP and of course it doesn't match any of
the other ones so you are not a double
entry and awesome awesome no no no I
focus here we go if someone says it's
rigged there's nothing to make about it
chances are if you're watching you've
entered and there's only what I've asked
you three thousand people watching Kyle
what are you doing stop making noise
okay banging stuff in the kitchen you
should just sit down just sit down go to
sleep it's like 6:30 it's my brother so
I give him crap for nothing all right
yep awesome congratulations Greg you won
that sceptre 275 B and yeah so something
to consider like even if you didn't win
you can check it out in our wish list
link in the video description
moving on now we have another case here
and this one is the TCO 11 dynamic razor
edition now the O 11 dynamic is
typically about a hundred 120 bucks but
this one is the eraser special we have
built in it we did showcase it I believe
it was that you I don't know if it was I
think we first saw it at CES I want to
stay in course they had it at actually
no they had it at Computex before that
yeah I'm pretty sure they did and this
case is a beautiful look I'm rockin the
Oh 11 dynamic right now this is a black
one in my personal rig my editing rig
and the razor Edition just makes it look
bling-bling now I'm not saying you have
to get this particular one you could
also get the regular black or leavin the
white 11 dynamic I really don't care
again Lenalee has no idea I'm including
their products in this video but for 140
bucks was a pretty solid discount here
they do have like it's kind of weird so
I'll show you the the white one and you
can see typically about a hundred and
twenty hundred thirty bucks right but if
you come over here to the black one you
have multiple options you get the black
standards $120 you can get the air RGB a
slightly different front also comes with
these they call them Bora fans I believe
and
just the regular air is a hundred bucks
so if interested in that you have that
for $100 here on new egg and then you
can also click the o limit dynamic razor
edition and that's a hundred and thirty
nine ninety nine I think it's really
good price for the razor Edition and
look it's just a beautiful looking case
you're paying more for The Bling yeah
sure some people are gonna like the RGB
yeah sure but I don't think anyone's
gonna complain about winning this for
free so I'm going to select the winner
now for this case and then I'm also
again going to urge you guys if you are
interested in buying this particular
case to do so now because this is
probably the lowest I've ever seen the
eraser edition of the O 11 and dynamic
so swingin on over here - I'm gonna go
ahead and let's bring up the giveaway a
raffle I put that bop bop go refresh
this one that way we get all the new
winners in here do it every time add a
random winner alright Brian J Brian J

Razer logo and bedded in there so it
captures the light really well from that
front IO there it's looking really good
so mr. Brian J you are gonna love this
one
congratulations I'm going to add your
info to the notepad so that I am keeping
track here and I'm gonna put in
parenthesis that's the O 11 dynamic
razor I'm gonna put joke email in here
huh alright congratulations Brian I
think it's a really good case this is
one of the best looking cases to be
honest and in my opinion I think this is
like yeah I think this is a really good
case for everyone telling me that I need
to rush I'm gonna I need a rush and get
through these things not gonna happen so
don't bother I'm going to include your
RP as well just to make sure that we're
not
double post here I also go back and
check these later on alright
congratulations one more time there
Brian J for the 11 dynamic razor edition
you can find this product as well as the
rest of the stuff for showcasing this
livestream linked down below and yeah
what's next here we have yeah this is
the corsair hydro series 100x now look i
am going to show you a cheaper 240 ml
oil in this but this one is from corsair
so if you trust course there of course
there i mean they make some of the best
a IOT's in my opinion in the business
and if you trust course there you want
to pay a little more for that course
their name i don't really blame you and
this of course is gonna fit into any
case that has 248 mill fan rad support
if it could support to 120 ml fans and
probably support a 240 mm anyway this is
the 100x extreme and i don't have
experience with this particular one
although i am rocking the 150 i in my
personal rig and that's one of the
reasons why i can tell you firsthand of
course their makes them pretty awesome a
iOS and for 80 bucks it's already a
pretty good deal right but if you want
to throw in that mail-in rebate I know
some people something you don't really
like to include mail-in rebates cuz you
have to wait for your money and then but
$15 million rebate you were bring this
thing down to 65 bucks this is like the
cheapest I've ever seen any 240 ml area
from Corsair and it's and that makes it
one of the cheapest AOS I've ever seen
straight up I think the cheapest I've
seen so far was like $60 so I think this
is a really good one for 80 bucks and
again if you want to bother if you want
to buy this yourself and throw in that
$15 rebate that brings it down to $65
net and yeah I think it's worth
considering here you get them to course
their SP series 120 ml fans actually the
mounting with these coolers is pretty
straightforward as well it's not gonna
be super time consuming and looks really
good I'm not sure if this is an RGB when
I don't think it's RGB but it lights up
white and in my opinion that's like the
best anyway because white pretty much
matches anything and yeah white LED lit
pump head you can see we had a nice and
beautiful copper block there and here's
all your install stuff you got all your
long screws short screws you got your
standoffs and your cap screws and back
plate the brace there you go two 120mm
fans good to go you guys know it

stuff like that so if you guys are
wondering you can enter via that
Rafflecopter linked in the video
description again you can find our wish
list link you can find our fantastic
sale permalink in there as well if you
want to just go generally shop and you
want to support us that would be
appreciated and alright alright here we
go
moving on to the next thing what do we
have here what's up next oh okay okay
one of the few graphics cards I have in
this list I don't generally promote like
I'm not gonna tell you like oh you have
to buy this r-tx card cause it's such a
good deal and really like my my opinion
about r-tx
at this point is like I still think that
the the ray-tracing aspect of touring is
kind of like it's an ish it's a very
strong nish and it is something that I
personally wouldn't be willing to pay
much more for so when I find r-tx cards
that are priced almost like cards that
don't have ray tracing but that are
around the same performance level and
those are the ones I want to show off so
if you're interested I mean this is a
pretty big giveaway here this is one of
the bigger giveaways in this live stream
just saying but this is the gigabyte
r-tx 2070 I'm not sure what there's just
the GB in 20 or GB and 2070 wf2 I'm not
sure why gigabyte didn't like name this
something specifically maybe there's
name something specific anyway you have
a promo code there for $50 off that
brings the price down to 400 and $29.99
if my math is correct I'm pretty sure it
is and yeah so I think if it's if you
can find at 20 74 around 400 bucks
that's a pretty good deal and that will
give you what kind of around 5700 XT
performance but you also get ray tracing
on top of that it didn't video drivers
and the car that runs significantly
cooler than at least the the the stock
5700 XT from AMD so we're actually gonna
be comparing this card here to the 57
our next team very soon the price
performance analysis talk about temps
and things like that so stay tuned for
that giveaway you also get another
Nvidia gift down here Wolfenstein
Youngblood that's a $30 value
effectively bringing this down to $400
even for just the car so that's a pretty
good deal you were already gonna buy
Wolfenstein Youngblood yeah and then you
include the promo code here fan tech 14
get yourself a 20 70 from gigabyte for
just yeah for just for two dollars I
think it's a pretty good deal for 2017
anyway here we go people
oh you guys are you waiting for this one
for this one okay I think I'll just uh
I'm gonna take a bathroom break I'll be
back later I'm just kidding let's go

the next thing by the way I'm not like
I'm not looking at the chat but I'm
assuming at least some of the people
wending here what are in here are yeah
I'm assuming these some of the people
who are winning are still in the live
stream if you don't want to stick around
for the the live announcements you can
enter and then leave that's fine I
understand some people aren't in the
optimal time zones for this live stream
but yeah I mean it would be cool to see
your name announced live and like as
immediate as possible I guess that's why
I would stick around if I was you and
you get to check out some awesome deals
from
come on I wouldn't you want to do that
so yeah I think this is a really good
one and you guys should check it out
again one of the most expensive items in
this list now drop it down to we have
another a I oh this one's from
Coolermaster you see this one's only 60
bucks excuse me this is one of the
cheapest I've been talking for what 20
30 minutes 40 minutes 45 minutes and my
voice is already going out and I
apologize this is a master liquid light
ml to 40 L I don't I I think I have
experience with this one I think I was
sent this one and I used it in a build
and I know I use I know it came with
those fans in particular it was a very
quiet AIO
and it just looked very sleek it's like
straight up blacked out and again it's
like the pump is pretty quiet the fans
are really quiet and for this price I
think it is us to you Seth is asking how
do you enter set read the video
description that's why it's there this
is a 240 ml a IO again it's RGB so you
can actually change I believe the the
fan LEDs as well as that front court
cooler master logo LED and let's see
let's scroll down a little ways here see
what they got what are they offering
kink resistant tubing I'd really hope
that you're a IO tooth would n't go
there now it suck I really surprised
that's a part of core Kohler masters a
marketing material yet that dual
dissipation pump so a dual chain a dual
chamber I'm assuming that's what they
mean dual chamber pump maybe and then I
get these two 120mm RGB air Balance fans
included so that's cool Oh kink
resistant to me okay so they're showing
you what's inside the tubing and then
they have it course wrapped around and
pretty sure it's a nylon but yeah looks
really good and see the specs there
should fit pretty much any case it has
two 120mm fan mounts right next to each
other and we're gonna be givin it away
here we go I'm clicking the next one
they're gonna refresh and a refresh I'm
refreshing it right now here we go all
right and add a random winner I really
like this Rafflecopter website it's
pretty awesome the next winner the
winner of this AIO is Wayne C and Wayne
Singh's email address ends in at RTS at
yahoo.com
so that's Wayne C email ends in RTS at
yahoo.com
you mr. Wayne are the winner of this
cooler master master liquid light in all
240 L 800 kind of a mouthful but for 60
bucks it's really not and if you're
considering an AI yo and you're kind of
on the fence about and then it's kind of
a lot of money and look it's an AI o so
it could leak in my system look I've had
literally I think only one AI o ever
leak at all and it wasn't a big leak
like it was something really small still
potentially hazardous to the rest your
components sure there is a tiny bit of
risk there but a lot of these bigger
name-brand companies have reputations to
uphold and I'm not gonna guarantee it's
not gonna leak but it's like it's a
really really rare thing that's like you
always hear that one horror story and
then everyone spreads that one horror
story but they ignore the fact that
thousands of other people buy these
coolers and I've known she was a tall so
there's my defense of an AI oh I mean I
know I'm not gonna convince some people
they're gonna swear by air coolers but
it's an option and I think 60 bucks is a
really good price so if you are again on
the fence check out our wish list link
it'll take you to the wish list that we
are navigating through right now that's
this one here and you can click it and
buy it if you're interested not sure how
long some of these deals are gonna last
we have more gal super loose RGB Ram I
got I don't even know if I told you guys
I was gonna do this but I had two
different kits of RAM here and from
Geils specifically that I wanted to give
away so these right here are the same
3000 megahertz I can see the the the
timings here 16 18 18 cast laid 216 so
decent timings again they're not super
great they're not in like the 15 or 14
territory at this frequency but it's
still gonna be decent for again like
your run-of-the-mill Rison build or
especially like Intel I think you're
gonna be just fine with really any
modern Intel apply form so yeah I think
it's a good good good deal here for 62
bucks if you're interested in again a
kid a ram you don't like the white Gale
modules that I showed you earlier I
think the black gal modules look really
good as well and you still get that RGB
support on top they'll sync up with a
soos or in case you're wondering so if
you wanna use or a sink and get
everything in your system looking nice
and flashy and synchronized with your
asus motherboard then these modules here
are for you alright we're going to give
these away we're just gonna jump right
into this one am I gonna drag
I'm clicking the random wonder button
let me refresh real quick and all the
new entrants in there and here we go the
random winner is Logan a and Logan a is
his email address ends in in TS at
gmail.com so Logan a at email address
ending in TS at gmail.com you are the
winner of these guy all super loose RGB
ddr4 modules congratulations my friend
look if you didn't win this and again
you're on the fence about buying memory
memory is really cheap now especially
daring these deals the fantastic sales
is a ton of modules to choose from I
think I have a few more kids of RAM in
the wish list in case you're wondering
but god this is a really good kit in my
opinion I think this is like one of the
better kits for this price especially so
you can find it in the link below it
takes you to the wish list you can click
on this it would give me a small
kickback and let's Newegg know that you
appreciate not only the giveaway because
this is a ton of money they're giving
away but also that you you appreciate
the competitive prices so awesome moving
on again we have another B for this is a
B for 54 this is a full-sized just ATX
so it's not Mata X now I TX obviously
this is a regular conventional dimension
ATX motherboard from gigabyte and look
it's not in my opinion this isn't like a
super super good deal this isn't like a
oh it's a $70 be for 50 motherboard
that's like got really great power
delivery this board by the way has
excellent power delivery and especially
for the price so about a hundred bucks
for this and the B 450 chipset is I mean
in many ways comparable to the x4 70
chipset you're gonna still get the
overclocking support you're gonna still
get let's see I'm not sure if you get
crossfire SLI not too sure I mean not
that it would really matter most of you
I imagine aren't running to cards I
wouldn't really recommend it in the real
world in practicality anyway but one of
the cool things about this board you get
that onboard Wi-Fi and Bluetooth which
is cool and you also get 7.1 audio and
pretty sure at 7.1 and it the Internet
jack back there USB type-c which is
convenient DVI out as well as HDMI out
if you want to run your APU some of your
2400 G or a 3400 G and
USB 3.0 just remember if you're gonna
pair this board with a Zen to ship that
you're going to need to update your BIOS
and in my experience these gigabyte BIOS
updates for Zen to support have been
pretty stable so I think gigabytes done
a pretty good job so far with the BIOS
updates and I wouldn't be afraid to
update it for Zen to support as long as
you have again either a dead ship or Zen
one or Zen plus for the update journeyed
to CPU to boot into your BIOS in the
first place so with all that out of the
way we're going to give it away here we
go when I click the button let me
refresh again here we go add a random
winner I'm clicking it I'm clicking it
and the winner is William C Williams see
your email address ends in a I L at
yahoo.com William C that's AI l that's
the ending of your email address ail at
yahoo.com you mr. William are the winner
of this is a be 450 or whisper
motherboard so this is a really good man
I'm actually gonna ask goodbye to send
me one of these because I want to run a
lot of tests for Zen 2 on this specific
board right here so stay tuned for that
night give me one second here got to
take a brief pause so I can jot down the
names of the last few winners I haven't
been doing that I need to catch up huh

here for mr. William Curtis then we'll
be caught up sorry for that small delay
folks okay and mr. William won the
gigabyte be 450 or is pro cool man and
top that IP in there huh okay all right
awesome awesome okay what do we have
next on the list by the way if you want
this board you want something similar to
this board you can find a other words
like this on a new eggs fantastic sale
so you cannot click any of the links
down below that will take it to any of
the bit ly links will take you to new
eggs website and you'll be able to shop
the fantastic sale you can also find my
specific wish list that is what this is
right here and you can shop these
components indirectly so it will help me
out it up new egg out and it'll be a
nice thank you to new egg for the $2,000
there throne as alright this is a little
beefier board here I still think this is
a really good price for x4 79 look it's
text 470 right it's not the
newest chipset but x4 70 will handle Zen
too just fine with BIOS update again
it's been great power delivery on this
board I really like the Taichi boards
and I've had experience with up to the
first type Chi board I think it was a
first time she bored with x99 and ever
since then I've really liked as rocks
Taichi boards the x5 70 we actually have
in the shop and we're gonna be running
some tests with that in the future but
this is a a 170 kala motherboard so yeah
I think you guys will like this one if
you don't have an AMD rising CPU at
least this is something you can work
towards or possibly just sell I don't
think I don't really care again what you
do with this after you win the product
after it shipped to you this product
here is it's it's just gonna be a solid
reliable board I haven't had any issues
with Tai Chi boards in the past I can
show you guys rear i/o if you are
interested so this comes with this is a
Wi-Fi you also have let's see one two
three four five six seven USB 3 ports
you also have a type C port which is
convenient you have HDMI out I think
this is a CMOS reset button and then you
have 7.1 audio or what looks like 7.1
audio with this board here and yeah
looks really good too good looking for
Tai Chi boards always look really nice
and 170 bucks so if you're in the market
for x4 70 again this is a pretty
future-proof platform here you can use
Zen Zen plus or Zen 2 chips with this
motherboard x4 7yz kind of like right in
the middle so it gets to feed off of the
earlier stuff as well as the newer stuff
for 170 bucks plus a $10 rebate in case
you're interested
$10 rebates not bad either and that will
get you this board here's 160 bucks if
you enter if you buy this and throw in
the rebate alright clicking that random

mr. aaron w you are the winner again of
the answer dog x47 Itachi
i am for motherboard the really good
motherboard and i
I really like again the Taichi series is
really nice so I'm gonna chop yo info
down here so that I don't forget uh-huh
you won me as rock x47 Itachi okay write
down your email your email address this
one at yahoo.com make sure I spelled
that correctly yep okay and I'm jotting
down your IP make sure we don't get any
double posters up in here okay all right
we're good to go
moving on now to what do we have next
week next year by the way you can check
out our wish list link in the video
description if you're interested next up
we have someone these are really
affordable on tools here and look the
reason why I kind of hesitated to
include this in the first place is
because it specifically says Intel z170
platform memory that doesn't mean that
you only have to use this with Intel
platforms though you can use this with
horizon and I assume you'd be fine with
it although the timings aren't again
super tight this is still pretty fast
memory for AMD so I wouldn't sweat it
you know throwing this and into a rigged
ahead like a 3600 X or a 3700 X or even
something like Zen plus this this would
be a great kid for that or even an
original Zent doesn't matter you know
depending on the board and a
compatibility there you might have
trouble reaching this frequency with the
originals and stuff but yeah I think
it's a really good price here what 53
bucks for this kit yeah I'm not gonna
complain at all this is like some of the
cheapest 3,000 megahertz of ddr4 I've
ever seen so yeah someone said that the
link I included for seeing countries is
not working but it works for me so if
it's not working for you I might mean
that your country is not supported I'm
not sure but it works for me here so I
don't really know what to say about that
anyway this Ram is this a g.skill what
do you say how you say this aegis I
guess they just and I think Aegis sounds
right but yeah nice low profile models
good thing about these is you can really
sleep these in any system have as beefy
a CPU cooler as you want and your
much guaranteed to not have any
interference at least with to optimal
slots because these modules are
literally as tall as a PCBs themselves
so nothing ostentatious would be great
for some low-profile small form-factor
builds and at 53 bucks again I ain't
complaining I am complaining about no
$53 ddr4 3000 mega ain't gonna happen so
really great 4G scale here and I get
four new egg to hook this up as well so
we're gonna give this away let's swing
it back over here to the giveaway page
and a refresh one more time here get all
the new entrants in I click that add a
random winner button and Wow okay we
have an Austin there is no last name
with it but your email address ends in
two to seven at gmail.com so if your
name is Austin and you have an email
address it ends in two to seven a
dreamer comm and you entered to win
something you just won yourself a kid
I'm a pretty affordable ddr4 modules
here at a pretty decent speed from
g.skill so awesome congratulations
Austin I'm going to type your name into
this here let's see Austin and I write
your email if you guys have really funny
email some of you like I wonder if you
guys apply for jobs with these emails I
really hope some of you don't
because thank you these emails are I
gotta let Pepsi in because she is
scratching at the door I got your IP
Austin so I know you haven't double
posted I will confirm that later and
awesome argument one cycle at Pepsi in
so the cat doesn't scratch the door
yeah I told you she's bipolar and
indecisive it's like the worst
combination okay anyway back to this
stuff so congratulations Austin you won
the cheese scale ages 16 gig kit of ddr4
modules I think it's not bad for 50
bucks so uh yeah if you want a pair of
modules like this and you want them
pretty fast and you want 16 gigs which
pre-much the bare minimum recommended
now for most gaming rigs at around least
six hundred seven hundred dollars or
more and this kit is one to consider in
my opinion this is really really cheap
Ram and you can find it linked in our
wish list in the video description no I
would have next year this is a dirt
cheap case but it oh it's a really good
price $40 for the master box light five
now I actually reviewed this case in a
video on the channel and it's a good
looking case in my opinion check that
out like you're gonna get let's see do
you get yeah I think I'm trying to see
if you get those three fans I'm not sure
if you do I don't think you get three
fans in there but let's see double check
because I don't remember if I got it or
not fans included you get yeah one rear
one twenty mill fan okay cool
alright so that's nice you get the I
think it's I'm pretty sure it's acrylic
and that's one of the reasons why the
cost is so cheap so that's actually one
of the cheapest products on the wish
list but it's one you should consider
again for budget builds this still looks
like a pretty solid case for $40.00 and
that's why I included it I mean like
it's not like the Razer edition from
leanly it's not the PC of an eraser or
anything like that but I want to have a
nice diverse list here for those who are
budget oriented as well as those who are
more enthusiast oriented so 40 bucks is
really good price and if you don't
happen to win this but you still want
the case and you can find it in our wish
list I am going to click the random
winner button here we go alright the
winner is from the UK his name is Samuel
B Samuel B
your email address ends in 9 9 0 @ sorry
I almost said Yahoo 99 zero at hotmail
Co dot uk' use them rockin know how many
email address ok ok Sam you old school
on me that's that's cool and let's type
your info in here so that I know who to
contact
ok good good and your IP to confirm you
don't have multiple entries excuse me
double check that later looking good all
right now look I know this is like one
of the cheapest things I wouldn't feel
bad though even if you won this say no I
think this is this is a pretty good case
so you could throw maybe throw like a
cheaper build into it and then flip it
and you make some more cash you know
that's something that's just an option
but if you want to build this for
yourself you'll have like a six hundred
dollar budget or so and you don't want
to spend too much on the case I don't
blame you this is a good option so yeah
again you can find it link in the
description if you were interested
swingin on down here we have another
graphics card this one is much more
budget oriented I showed this in the
last video on the channel as well this
is a power color a red dragon look it's
an RX 570 it's nothing super fancy by
any means it's a four gig car but it'll
have 1080p games with ease for the most
part in modest settings maybe medium to
high which is plenty for most people
130 bucks and this is a really good
price is the cheapest I've ever seen RX
5 seventies new although you can get
them used on sites like eBay for even
cheaper when I was buying our x5 70s and
80s on eBay about six to 12 months ago I
was spending I was spending about the
what was it about hundred about a
hundred bucks maybe a little more than
that for a few rx5 70s and 80s the
difference between five seventy-five
eighty it's not very much 580 s will be
obviously a little bit better but for
this price I'm not gonna complain and I
highly doubt whoever wins this giveaway
is gonna complain so you're getting it
for free plus you get $10 off with the
promo code vgap cjp 7-7 then to bring
this cost down to effectively 120 USD
any one or 20 bucks again really good
price for the power color card your
nothing against power color this don't
make good stuff although they might not
be as popular as some of the
I guess household names like a soos and
MSI and whoever else it's still a good
car then again
whoever wins its getting it for free so
there's that but if you're interested
you can find a link in the wish list in
the video description we're gonna go
ahead and click another winner
okay this is someone from the US his
name is Robert W Robert W you have one
your email address ends in l82 at
hotmail.com and IROC on the hotmail
address to you I got two hotmail winners
in the chat okay so yeah if your email
address ends in LA to you at hotmail
comm and your name is Robert W then you
just won yourself a power colored red
dragon rx 570 congratulations my friend
and I'm gonna jot down your info make
sure that I type it correctly uh-huh
that's hotmail.com not another code at
UK like the last winner okay cool all
right and I have your IP here so I can
confirm that we don't have multiple
entries
uh-huh okay cool
all right here we go folks moving on to
the next thing by the way again I'm
gonna say one more time because I really
do appreciate Newegg making this
possibility if you want to buy this card
check it out in the wish list linked in
the video description it is a good card
for the price in my opinion this is a
pair of Vengeance RGB Pro modules from
Corsair $69.99 this is gonna be some of
the best memory that you find now the
timings are not the greatest timing okay
it's not that great it's a 16 20 20 cast
latency 16 so slightly higher timings
and some of the other models we showed
you and they were a bit cheaper than
this but this is a name brands this
course they're gonna get a good warranty
with these you're also gonna get the
beautiful RGB up top it is very very
well diffused so you're not gonna see
individual LED
top that's kind of like RGB trying to
see from a g.skill so again benjin's RGB
pro modules these are typically pretty
expensive so Rams come down quite a bit
in price and they look really good you
see that's what they look like in a
system in case you are wondering so I
think this is really good price 70 bucks
again if you're interested check these
out if you want a name brand like
Corsair or g.skill we have these kits
linked in the video description in our
new egg fantastic sale wish list if
you're wondering all right we're gonna
select a winner here we go refreshing
the page get all the new winners in
there how many entries do we have by
then curious four thousand one hundred
and something okay that's a lot of
entries here we go picking a winner John
W John W and your Gmail address ends an
OTT at gmail.com and you just won
yourself a pair of course their
vengeance modules check that out my dude
that's pretty good there 16 gigs plenty
for most gaming pcs and the like and
gonna look mighty fine at the same time
so congratulations John W I'm gonna jot
down your info all right now huh that in
let's see I got you email huh a good
email address my friend some good email
address and I've got your IP for
confirmation as well as double checking
to make sure we don't have double
entries I know I sound like a broken
record I'm just saying this so you guys
know why I'm keeping track of it uh-huh
Corsair Vengeance EDR for also know they
go back up here who was it that one knee
that was g.skill yep ok so Austin won
the G skilled modules down huh alright
we're all caught up and hit ctrl s cool
Pepsi once in again let me let her in
she wants to play
please don't and then she runs into her
house I put her house like right under
right under my desk so she said she
sleeps like right there and then every
now and then she'll stick her head out
and she'll look at me and she'll try to
sneak up on me and she'll pounce and
then she'll retreat back into her house
and do it all over again it's cats for
you congratulations John W for winning
this pair of course their vengeance RGB
pro modules really good price in my
opinion 70 bucks check them out in the
link in the video and description all
right what do we have here our last
thing this is a pair of modules again
more ddr4 I figured you guys wouldn't
mind this because ddr4 isn't pretty
expensive as of late so it's really nice
to show you some affordable modules here
these are a team group t4s delta to RGB
series modules and they are mighty fine
for the price in my opinion I really
like team team group modules I've worked
with team group many times in the past
and they make really good stuff so my
personal rigs have used team group and
ddr4 and I haven't had an issue today
even with the storage with the permanent
storage drives that they sell and I'm
actually using to team group m2 and Mimi
drives in my raid 0 config for my
personal rig and that raid 0 config is
held up just fine so I'm one of the %
behind team group and I would I would be
perfectly fine mixing them up with some
of the more household names like Corsair
again and G skills so they make really
good stuff if you guys have own team
group stuff you know that I'm not being
paid to say this team who doesn't dawn
think looting their stuff no no these
companies do I just wanted you guys to
know that's how I felt about this
company in these products so 60 bucks
for this really good price ddr4 3000 and
this is gonna be the last giveaway
raffle so if you haven't entered yet
click that link in the video description
it tells you what to do if you're

in our wish list so yeah that's a lot of
stuff it's gonna be a lot of emails
after this we're gonna have so much
admin to do and then I'm have to find
what we're gonna do what we talked about

minute

handle the US giveaways myself so what
I'm gonna do is use my own new egg
account I'm gonna send you guys who live
in the US your stuff right so it's just
gonna be like a reimbursing so I'm gonna
pay for that pocket and then knew I
could reimburse me what we mail out for
the u.s. I'm not gonna give you like the
overnight shipping screw that it's gonna
be too expensive sorry guys you have to
wait a little bit for your stuff but
it's free stuff so I wouldn't complain
about where you
and then the International winners if
you live in either like the UK or the
France Germany where whatever countries
were in that global list I showed you
earlier in the livestream then what
you're going to win basically is a gift
card or gift card equivalent from Newegg
so you'll be able to spend that money on
new egg in your respective country and
you can really pick whatever you want
you don't have to pick the stuff that
you won here but you'll get the
equivalent price of that item from new
egg so that's how we're gonna work it
out I'm not sure how perfect this is
gonna be but yeah we'll see let's see
I'm getting a lot of F's here did I miss
something I feel like I miss something
