up and last time we touched on a few
good ads mixed in with the bad ones you
guys seem to feel okay about that but a
lot of you watch these these videos
because you want to see the terrible
stuff you want to see me rip into it
talk about what I would pay for
especially like extremely old used
hardware and that's all we're gonna do
in this video I have about four or five
terrible ads lined up and I gave you
guys a taste of this on Twitter
yesterday if you follow me there so
without further ado we're gonna get
started off here with this this one
eight hundred dollars powerful gaming PC
I I don't know what these people think
when they list these these ads but like
in my opinion this guy's wasting its
time all right cut to the intro and then
a word from our sponsor and we back to
this stuff stay tuned we're asking
people on the street would you rather
have the car on the right or the car on
the left which comes with a mess is to
set a serious question taking this there
you have it people prefer the mess is
too
so what we have here powerful gaming PC
800 bucks now what made me click on this
ad was not the fact that he was wanting
800 bucks for a powerful gaming PC you
can find plenty of this on Craigslist
and frankly a lot of them are decent
deals but for 800 bucks I expect a lot
more than what I see in this opening
picture here first off I see dust
everywhere I have no idea what kind of
CP cooler so it looks like some like
classic zom and cooler not terrible
looking but it does look quite bad when
you've got dust caked into it as much as
this guy has we have a GTX 580 that is
ancient by today's standards also looks
fairly dusty and then we have these just
these are cringe-worthy molex to PCIe
power adapters it's not looking too
great but he's definitely trying to sell
it so let's check out what he says here
too much to list to message me if you
have any specific questions just yeah
I'm just taking offers at this point 3.8
4.2 gigahertz ACS crossfire 5 formulas
II I don't know why you'd listen CPU
frequency before you list the CPU you're
talking about two different things here
anyway FX 4100 processor and he says
easily overclock of what a 4.2 never
needed to go for higher I'm sure you
didn't buddy 16 gigs of ram ddr3
obviously 2133 1 terabyte WD black he's
got a cheese 600 Logitech mouse NVIDIA
GTX 580 after market case doesn't say
what kind of case we can see a few
pictures there though and loaded with
times 7 plus big fans with red LEDs
several aftermarket fans and heatsink so
he's definitely trying to sell you on
the the RGB aspect of this build and
anyone who's dabbled in the use market
of pcs know is that RGB does help sell
most computers first off the FX platform
is virtually dead you can get rise in
CPUs on the use market for around 50 60
bucks that'll blow the FX 4100 out of
the water you might even get Verizon
CPUs cheaper than that depending on
where you look who you buy them from I
wouldn't pay more than 10 bucks for an
FX 4100 and I'm being dead serious about
that the 16 gigs of ram is nice ddr 390
dr 4 again this is a platform we have to
deal with but 16 gigs is you know I'd
pay upwards of 60 60 bucks or so for
ddr3 16 gigs worth and that's probably
overpaying but given how dear impresses
a
fluctuated recently I'd say that's an
okay offer there so right now we're at a
hundred bucks right for the CPU
motherboard and RAM he wants 800 so we
got to come up with $700 somewhere else
in this list here of components the GTX
580 honestly not worth very much I
wouldn't pay more than 40 50 bucks for
that and I would only pay that much just
because I'd like to have something that
vintage on the shelf for testing in the
future but I would never use it as a
serious gaming card only a 2gig buffer
it's not gonna be a lot for some modern
1080p gaming even and that's why I
hesitate to even make an offer on this
PC so yeah I'm feeling maybe 200 to 250
for this rig which is 1/4 of what this
guy's asking and then on top of it is
didn't look like I was taken care of and
the parts are very very out of date so
yeah that's my verdict on that one I'd
pay about 1/4 of what this gentleman is
asking on to the next build this is
custom gaming pc with nvidia geforce
1070 graphics card okay now gtx 1070 is
good he's got a monitor NEC 850 right
but here's here's the problem
3.2 gigahertz Sandy Bridge Intel
processor ok I have no idea what
processor that is ok Sandy Bridge that's
great but what are we talking here core
i5 core i7 if it was a core i7 I feel
like he would state that which is why
I'm not going to give him the benefit of
the doubt and assume it's a core i7 I'm
going to assume it's a Core i5 and then
256 GB SSD to one terabyte hard drives 8
gigs of RAM however he says
performance RAM and then a Coolermaster
case I don't know what Coolermaster case
this is but it looks like it was built
in the early 2000s and then comes with a
27 inch 1080p monitor Logitech G 17
keyboard that's great but it's not gonna
add much to the price here he's got a
smart 750 watt Thermaltake power supply
again not looking too juicy here cable
management is kind of black but I can't
really blame him because the case
doesn't look like it's very easy with
which to manage cables so starting price
here 850 yeah I'm not seeing that at all
let's say gtx 1070 love let's give them
254 I bought GTX 10 70s on eBay for as
little as 200 bucks and this is a super
clock EVGA card so it's nothing super
fancy
these typically go for between 2 and 260
on ebay so let's say 250 is given the
upper end 250 bucks let's assume a core
i5 sandy bitch processor I don't know if
it's overclockable or not he doesn't say
what kind of motherboard he's sporting
but it doesn't look like a very high-end
motherboard either this one's tough it's
a tough call I'm gonna assume it's a
lock processor and that that is not a
z-series chipset doesn't look like it is
and that would lead me to assume that
the CPU is gonna be worth maybe on the
used market a hundred bucks at most and
then maybe another forty bucks for the
motherboard guy that's a stretch too so
140 plus 250 let's call it an even 400
he's got a hyper 212 Evo is what it
looks like so another 20 bucks used for
that so what do we have 420 and then 8
gigs of ram gonna be ddr3 so 40 bucks
for 60
he's got 256 he guesses 250 bucks off
used I'd pay 40 if that let's say 40
heck I'm just splitting hairs here 500
bucks
to one terabyte hard drives I would pay
50 for the pair so what do we had near
550 I'm sure I'm doing some of this math
wrong I'm just kind of spitting out
numbers but we're around 5 to 550 here
at 27 inch 1080p monitor he doesn't say
what refresh rate it is I'm gonna assume
it's trash otherwise he probably would
have stated it so cheap 1080p monitor
wouldn't pay more than 50 60 bucks for
so we're at 5 550 in the $600 price
range when you include the mechanical
keyboard assume you even want to pay for
that and yeah the asking price is 850 so
I definitely start much lower than this
the 1070 is cool but a lot of this older
hardware is difficult to flip and also
difficult to use with some modern games
especially if you plan on buying this
strictly for gaming so in my opinion I
would start at 400 bucks and just see if
he's even willing to entertain an offer
close to that amount because I wouldn't
go a over 500 bucks for this and even
that's a stretch I'm not even sure I
want to pay 500 bucks to this I think
I'd hold for him at 400 knowing that he
would probably end up turning it down
but hey that's what you get when he
asked way too much for a bill that is
several years old
save the graphics card now the next one
is a gaming PC for $1,800 what made me
click on this one was I noticed that it
wasn't custom cooled it looked like a
typical Pascal card you know an OK CPU
cooler and then a fairly you know
run-of-the-mill case from Corsair looks
like the 4 60 X to the 400 see and white
so we're just gonna run through the
specs here let's see GT X 1080 founders
Edition I wouldn't pay more than 300
I've gotten GTX and 80s for 300 bucks so
for a founders card 3 let's say 320 320
okay and then a 250 250 gig SSD another
30 40 bucks
so 320 let's make it 350 360 800 watt
power supply had no idea what kind of
power supply it's probably run in the
middle again so let's call it 400 even
16 gigs of DDR 4 that's gonna be used 80
bucks and that's that's probably a say
we don't know what kind of ddr4 it is
what kind of 16 gig kid it is but let's
say 80 bucks for that so that's 480 a 6
motherboard 50 bucks 60 again I don't
know like you're not detailing the parts
so I don't know what to offer you and
that's the problem when you don't list
these specifics with these components
and I don't know how good or bad they
are and I'm going to assume the worst
because who in the right mind would just
vaguely list the name of parts if they
spent hundreds of dollars but there were
genuinely good parts let's see this is
my gaming PC I built and I rarely play
it anymore I absolutely love this thing
but money is low as of right now but the
specs are and then he lists aspects that
we just went through so I I'm I'm
struggling to even reach $1,000 in this
build my dude and you you want $1,800
for it the parts right now especially in
the use market are nowhere near this
expensive and this last one here at the
x58 Xeon have to call Brian in for this
one our X 480 gaming PC $700 selling
gaming PC perfect fortnight pub G Ark
Rainbow six siege destiny GTA 5 blah
blah blah okay
comes with a Z on a 55 20 quad-core
hyper threaded CPU we'll talk more about
that in second XFX AMD rx 488 gig GP
you 16 gigs of mixed ddr3 okay
gold gold fur never even heard of that
before gold for 128 gig SSD paired with
a 300 gigabyte mechanical hard drive
only at three pieces is this is an old
system
I mean clearly on a picture but he's
like pairing some old stuff with with
some new components including that
graphics card this is gonna be a little
weird and then the power supplies of
course their CX 450 and semi modulated
plus bronze board and 50 watt power
supply comes with 10 free games already
installed would make for a good late
Christmas present for a kid yeah because
I think a kid is the only like person
who's gonna spend $700 in the system
that's probably why you said that asking
$700 firm this guy's in for a rude
awakening all right II
55:20 CPU let's cut right to that real
quick this is of course a Xeon it is
actually based on the Nehalem
architecture which was launched back in
2009 which makes this a 10 year old CPU
it has a very very low frequency
operating frequency at its base is 2.2 6
gigahertz a turbo frequency of up to 2.5
3 gigahertz and I believe that is only
on one core so not only do we have
ancient architecture of 45 nanometer
lithography but we also have a low
frequency this CPU is the definition of
a bottleneck when it comes to pretty
much any game that's relatively modern
on Steam or origin or wherever this is
my thinking he bought this card maybe a
year and a half ago when they were
fairly expensive when the mining craze
was approaching its peak he probably
paid three to four hundred dollars for
it and he found out that he couldn't
flip it for that much so he decided to
throw it into a super cheap workstation
PC from 10 years ago and hoped that he
could flip this the whole thing and try
to get all of his initial investment
back from the graphics card maybe he got
the workstation for free and that's just
thinking and he put like a cheap but
power supply that you could buy from
Amazon for like 30 bucks in it that's my
thinking now he says that it's perfect
for fortnight pub gr Rainbow six siege
destiny GTA 5 etc that's a load of crap
I wouldn't pay a dime over 10
20 bucks for the Xeon CPU and that would
be again just for kicks and giggles
because I would end up just fiddling
with it for science but I would under no
circumstance try to flip this as a
gaming PC and then on top of that try to
get it sold for $700 that just leaves a
nasty taste in the mouth so yeah Rance
over now I gotta calm down a little
better these these were pretty bad I
mean what scares me more is that people
still might find builds like this and
say oh these must be perfectly valid for
gaming why else with this person asked
$700 for this rig if it you know if it
wasn't good and that's what I that's
what I'm afraid of that's one of the
reasons why these videos exist the other
reason is because you guys just
genuinely like you know checking out old
hardware and see me roast some of this
stuff so avoid these at all cost
I would not put my stamp of approval on
any of them and I frankly this last one
here is just insulting like trying to
pass this off as a gaming PC is
downright disgusting you're gonna fool
some kid it's exactly what you said you
wanted to do was you wanted to sell it
to some kid or at least sell it to a
parent that would give it to a kid and
assume the parent has no idea what he's
buying into because this is not a gaming
PC and the only people you could
possibly fall into thinking this was a
gaming PC are kids anyway what do you
guys think about these builds leave a
comment down below and then you can also
link your own Craigslist Facebook
Marketplace let go finds whatever you
can send this to me
either via Twitter you can send them on
facebook Messenger I don't recommend you
guys email this to me we have filters
for that kind of stuff so they come from
you know just generic Gmail addresses or
anything like that I might not see it we
try to save the the business email for
business inquiries but if you do have a
few that you want to show off set them
to me on Facebook I have the Facebook
link down below you can also tweet me
add on Twitter and that's a another
place where I'm pretty active and
usually I respond fairly quick my
phone's always on me and then yeah we'll
hope we'll look forward to the next one
hopefully you guys enjoyed this one let
me know if you did give this video a
thumbs up if you did I appreciate that
click that red subscribe button for more
content science or just fun like this
that will fit you in the next video this
is science studio thanks for cringing
