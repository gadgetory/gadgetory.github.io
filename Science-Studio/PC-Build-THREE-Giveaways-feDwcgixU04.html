let's go ahead and give it away how
about that gigabyte and enter max have
sponsored this entire build and it told
me to give it away so what we're going
to do here are actually host two
giveaways the first one is going to be
this build here I don't know what
Pepsi's doing back there anyway this
system will be given away to someone in
the US for obvious reasons I believe
it's just too expensive to ship this
overseas now for those who live overseas
not to worry I have another giveaway for
exclusively international viewers and
they will be running at the same time so
this giveaway here and the graphics card
giveaway for the international viewers
so if you live in the US you have a
chance to win this entire system here
and if you are an international viewer
what I'm going to do is throw in a
graphics card actually maybe maybe two
maybe I'll just do two graphics
especially to international giveaways
and we will be shipping those to the
winners doesn't matter where you live as
long as you can receive physically
packages and as long as it's not going
to be like a thousand dollars to ship
the thing because if that's the case
it's like four or five times the price
of the card and I'm just gonna PayPal
you some money you can buy your own car
in your own country but that aside we're
gonna focus on the build video because
this is gonna look really cool I think
it's gonna be a white and black theme
build we do have a black motherboard
from gigabyte but pretty much everything
else in the system is going to be white
including this beautiful lynktec AIO
from inner max and this white r-tx 20 70
hiding behind the power supply so uh
yeah let's get to building
figure by its XIII 90 horas pro packs
the necessities and more for next night
Jen Intel rig boasting a properly
doubled 12 plus one phase power solution
stylish aesthetic with built-in
backplate dual BIOS eight fan hubs the
list goes on
click the link below to learn more
quick pause I wanted to show you this
cool memory kit from gigabytes just
called our srgb memory like that's
literally what it's called so
interesting naming scheme anyway you get
four modules in here but only two of
them are functional only two of them
have memory chips on the PCB so the
other two are just for show the cool
thing is you're paying a lot less than a
typical fordham kit you know even if you
get 16 gigs usually four by fours and it
cost more than eight by two so this is
actually really nice because gigabyte
isn't charging much more for the
additional two modules here they're
gonna fill out all four of our RAM slots
on our z3 90 motherboard which is which
is cool I mean if you're if you're
someone who likes to you know deck it
out as much as possible but you're not
worried about buying like a 32 gig kit
like two or three hundred bucks because
those prices are still pretty insane
then this might be for you
all right so here she is and all our
glory we have a blue theme set up here
the cool thing is it's all hooked up to
the motherboard via an addressable RGB
hub so we can actually control all of
the LEDs in the entire system through
gigabytes RGB fusion software now I know
gigabytes software is and the best a lot
of you tend to feel pretty strongly
about that I don't blame you but I will
say that the RGB fusion - that we're
using here is pretty intuitive and
straightforward if you want a certain
theme a certain effect to happen or
maybe you just want a certain color
static like we have here it's very
simple to do a few seconds click
minimize and it's good to go I do want
to touch on a few hiccups I ran into you
might have noticed in some of the b-roll
Clips first off the i/o tubes would not
fit between the motherboard and the
graphics card that's just because the
graphic artist pushed too far back and
that's kind of a good thing to think
about it for temps right so there's a
ton of space here between the left side
panel and the fans for the graphics card
that means a graphics card should not be
choking for at all and we have
independent videos regarding these kinds
of vertical kits that reveal that
temperatures really don't change much at
all in fact in some cases temperatures
improve with this configure if you don't
like this style maybe have a capture
card you want to include in your system
or whatever then you can totally switch
this back to the standard horizontal
layout not an issue at all now as a
result of mounting the a i/o up top the
fan rad combo we could not install a
rear fan that there was a rear fan
included with the case but the
motherboard in conjunction with the a
i/o being placed how it was now was just
not allowing enough space for that 140
mph and fit you could put a 120mm fan
back there without the a IO on top of
course the tubes are blocking you now
but the motherboard itself is actually
too big the rear i/o shroud for a 140 mm
fan so it looks a bit bare back there
but again we do have the tubes at least
to kind of take up some of that space
and at least you get to see the
beautiful rear i/o shield on the rear
are shielded the shroud over the rear
i/o ports on the SZ community or s Pro
from gigabyte need see the Auris logo
light up - so if that's your thing there
you go now as for storage it's probably
my fault
and I think there was a miscommunication
to myself and market reps but we only
have a hundred twenty-eight gig SSD in
here and my justification for that is
like okay look if you already have a
system which if you're watching this
video you probably do you probably have
a hard drive with your Steam library
loaded up on it all you need to do is
swap that hard drive in here you
actually need to swap it just include it
in here keep the SSD as it is we've got
activated Windows 10 Pro running on this
thing and you'll be fine there's really
nothing else you need to do I could have
thrown in a hard drive but that's one of
the things that can be pretty sensitive
especially if I ship this via FedEx or
UPS you know those kinds of moving parts
tend to not fare well dering shipping so
just the SSD I mean you could tape this
really anywhere but I mounted it to the
front here to kind of cover up some of
the cables that you might see behind
this little panel next to the
motherboard and that's kind of the best
I could do I don't have many SSDs on
hand I only have two hard drives and
both of those I use for testing so it's
just it's a bring your own hard drive
scenario sorry but the good thing is
they're not too expensive with that I'm
looking forward to hearing what you guys
think about this case down below in the
comment section also if you're wondering
how to enter this particular giveaway
we're going to include a link down below
yes it's going to be a gleam link
I don't like gleam I've told you in the
past and I like using gleam in fact from
my own personal giveaways I don't use
gleam at all I gave for Christmas I gave
away like for graphics cards and I did
them all on different social media
accounts so if you're following me on
Twitter just retweet the post and you're
entered into the giveaway for this
though because we have companies
involved I said this and one of my older
videos regarding how we're gonna handle
giveaways we're going to use gleam but
we're not going to have like the 15
entries and all that just garbage that
you'll see on other channels other
giveaways that I can't control I'll be
in control of this giveaway it'll be my
own gleam account that we'll be using
and all we're going to be doing is just
requiring you guys to subscribe to to
science studio and then I think for
gigabyte and enter max just follow them
on Twitter I'm pretty sure that's gonna
be it so just three ways to enter I
might throw in my own Twitter as well
because Twitter it tends to be a pretty
popular source for media guys like
myself so three Twitter and then I
subscribe from science studio that's it
for entries and
there's any more than that you guys
cannot you guys can yell at me uh-huh
but I think that's all we're gonna do so
if you already subscribe you already
basically enter just go you know enter
normally it's pretty straightforward if
we have any issues with YouTube and the
giveaway thinks and that's been kind of
a hot topic and how YouTube is handling
giveaway links and stuff like that it
can be in violation of Terms of Service
I will tell you in a pin comment as well
as a description where you can go to
enter the giveaway so if it's not in the
description itself look somewhere else
the screen just went black look
somewhere else either a pin comment or a
video description and that'll tell you
where to find the giveaway link alright
now for the international viewers I have
a solution to your concerns I know you
were probably upset that you can't win
this right here but like I said shipping
is going to cost several several hundred
dollars and that's assuming it's just
going across the smaller pond right if I
gotta ship this but I don't know India
that would be fairly expensive to say
the least so I'm going to ship you
smaller stuff that it's still pretty
valuable in my eyes and you get two
chances to win so I think you'll
appreciate then we go get the graphics
cards alright how about we do a 980ti
let's see I know it's Maxwell but a 90
of Ti is as good as a 1070 which is good
as a 2060 almost so this is this is a
pretty good card in my opinion and even
if you want to buy these yous around to
250 bucks USD so that's not bad but
that's why I'm including another one as
well and this is a gtx 1018 up and
buying these not not frequently but i've
every now and then if i find a good deal
on ebay i buy these out of my own pocket
well i should say my own business pocket
it's a business expense technically but
nonetheless these aren't sent to me i
buy these myself and i had plans to give
a lot of these away in the future
because i think these cars are still
very very valuable in terms of like what
they offer for the price in the use
market particular and actually the
prices of these have been going up as of
late this card brand new was actually
actually was a clearance item i'm not
sure where this came from specifically
it looks like it looks like this is a
micro center sticker but it says it sold
for 485 bucks it was originally $539 now
you can get these for around
to 400 bucks although because they're
very hard to find now because they don't
make Pascal cards anymore
these are often times as much as they
cost brand new in the use market so
anyway GT X 1080 super claw from EVGA
that's one giveaway and then also the 92
TI from ZOTAC this is a beefy and
extreme card and this will be the other
giveaway so if you are an international
viewer you can win either of these and
if you're wondering how you can enter to
win those it's gonna be very simple
because this is this is my own channel
giveaway right this this is different
because we have companies involved but
for these two because it's just graphics
cards that I bought in a pocket we're
just gonna be doing these internally and
because of that all I'm going to require
international viewers to do is retweet
the Twitter post which will be up it'll
be linked and then also on Facebook
we're gonna have these posted so if you
share the post on Facebook that's a way
to enter as well as if you retweet the
tweet on Twitter then there's your
second entries now I'm only asking
international viewers to do this if I
draw your name and I find out that
you're actually live in the US or you
give me a u.s. address then you will be
disqualified for obvious reasons that's
not to say you can't share it for the
sake of your international friends that
would be appreciated just know that
you're not going to be able to win if
you retweet or share on either Twitter
or Facebook so that's how you can win
those again international viewers only
and this one due to shipping
restrictions just my own financial
restrictions this is a USA only giveaway
so if you live in the u.s. if you have a
u.s. address and you you only live there
then I only live there if you're there
and you can receive it personally that
will make you eligible I'm not going to
do the whole if you live in England but
you have a friend who lives in the US
can he win it on my behalf like we're
not doing that the person that I speak
to who enters a giveaway with his or her
address needs to be the person that
receives it okay I don't care what you
do with it after that you can sell it
you can part it out I really don't care
but just make sure that you live in the
US if you enter this giveaway here if I
find out that you are not in the US and
you enter and then I also find out that
you retweeted this because I will do my
research
I gather all the data I can pile it on
so then you'll be disqualified from the
international giveaway so don't abuse
this okay USA only international only
great I know this is the Internet so
it's probably not bound hold up very
well but anyway now that you guys
appreciate the giveaways that we're
offering here I tried to keep this as
inclusive as possible I do not like
doing USA only giveaways in fact I don't
think I've ever done one of those before
so because the shipping is gonna be
pretty much on me and we have a fixed
budget from gigabyte to work with we're
going to keep this USA only and then
we'll do the international giveaways at
the same time I'll open up for about 4
weeks for all the giveaways so that'll
give us about a month to let the shares
and stuff saturate that way we get the
most people enter as possible and yeah
should be good to go if you guys like
this build maybe like the fact that
we're doing giveaways at all let me know
by giving someone a thumbs up I
appreciate it leave a comment down below
expressing whatever feeling you happen
to be feeling at the time and I click
the red subscribe button if you're
feeling especially fancy and there's
nothing wrong with feeling fancy let me
tell you folks this is science studio
thanks for watching and thanks for
building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
