as certified refurbished I believe it's
a dell optiplex PC but it was about a
hundred and ninety eight bucks on new
egg used to refurbish however you wanna
look at that I thought it was a pretty
decent deal and I wondered could we turn
this into an awesome gaming PC for just
an extra couple hundred bucks and my
thinking is if we fairly used gtx 1070
in here for $200 which is in my opinion
the best money spent on a graphics card
at this point if you're willing to
consider both the new and used markets I
think this could turn into a very viable
gaming PC so we're gonna find that out
in this video all right well it's
packaged very nicely and this here is
the system and you can see it is all
wrapped up how good does it look on the
inside all right here we go and yes kind
of what I expected
I'll walk you through each component in
here and we'll talk about what we're
gonna do to make this system viable at
least somewhat for gaming so this ladies
and gentlemen is a beautiful if I do say
so myself
old school I 5 PC actually not that old
school technically speaking I've got a
core i5 3470 in there 8 gigs of ddr3
looks like an M ATX motherboard we do
have four PCI slots oh that's nice we
can put a graphics card up here at the
top 16 lanes slot and then we have a 128
gig SSD with Windows 10 loaded on it and
it's activated we get this case here
which I mean to be honest if you didn't
like it you could just pull all this
stuff out and put it in a new case it
doesn't look super pretty I want to see
though I'm not sure if they have
dedicated PCIe cables with this power
supply the power supply is Wow looks
like max outputs 275 watts that's gonna
be cutting it awfully close so I think
we're gonna need to have a power supply
upgrade with this system if we want to
run a dead discrete graphics card but
yeah as is when we have integrated
integrated graphics here so if we just
wanted to run a system to like you know
use for Microsoft Word or Excel or just
browse the web this could certainly
handle that we want the discrete
graphics if we're gonna play some games
so we're gonna need to upgrade the power
supply and then throw in that graphics
card maybe even upgrade storage 128 gigs
is it's great as an SSD but it's not a
lot of storage so we might need to boost
that up as well all I don't expect us to
go much over $400 there total but total
budget here maybe 40 bucks for a power
supply and then another 40 for a hard
drive so between four and $500 I'll
tally it all up at the end of the video
and tell you how much we spent with that
let's go ahead and start upgrading
all right and this is the new and
improved system I'm gonna run through
the upgrades and I'll have to tell you
how I'm gonna run the test because I'm
not sure if I'm going to test in 1080p
or 1440p just to prove a point because I
think this could handle 1440p but I
might just do 1080p just to show you the
higher frame rates we drop the
resolution so the upgrades obviously the
graphics card first we have an Rx 484
gig here which you can pick up for
around a hundred bucks on eBay so really
cheap staying in the tight budget space
I also threw in a one terabyte WD blue
hard driving at least for 30 40 bucks on
Amazon also a 600 watt power supply you
can get by with maybe a 500 watt here
but 600 walk if it's a bit more lead way
nothing fancy by any means
sorry about that background noise
Pepsi's Pepsi's playing with something
what are you doing but anyway this is
still cheap enough and safe enough I've
used plenty of these in the past that I
don't think you'll have anything to
worry about and it's significantly
better than that stock 275 watt PSV that
was originally in here also I didn't
mention this earlier but you get a five
and a quarter inch little disk drive
which is nice so if you want to run your
DVD CDs in here it does come with that
now many cases today do include that
support so that's nice and yeah
everything's powered up just for pin
stuff I'm gonna EPS up top
I just sets for your dedicated CPU power
I think I'm just gonna stick with a
stock CPU cooler I think I think
something slightly better would do this
build a lot of service but and just to
keep things in check budget wise I don't
think I'm gonna touch that this keeps us
still I believe under 400 bucks in total
for this so the whole system
brand new we're not brand new but
refurbished was 200 bucks or so and then
we have a hundred all the graphics card
that's 300 bucks
340 380 390 let's just call it an even
400 and yeah so here's your $400 build
and right now we're gonna throw it
through the wringer and see how well it
performs in some of today's modern games
now while we're setting this up I
figured I should also mention the fact
that you get a mouse included with the
purchase this is not gonna be anything
special by any means but I mean hey it's
a mouse it literally weighs like 10
grams I'm not even joking it probably
weighs yeah I'm pretty sure this box
weighs more than this Mouse does still
you get one you also get this beautiful
membrane key
bored you know real quick though one
thing I did notice when I was installing
the hard drive I just kind of let this
hang here it's a SSD doesn't really
matter is that this SSD is unbranded not
that it really matters I mean it's going
to be use a SATA 3 interface so I expect
speeds between 250 and 500 megabytes per
second this one really isn't I mean is
that like a brand I've never heard of
it's kind of unbranded but we'll be sure
to test the speed of this as well
because this isn't something that the
listing was specific about another thing
that I seemingly overlooked is the fact
that this case really has no air flow so
I mean there's one exhaust fan I'll
pivot the camera here in a sec so
there's one exhaust fan and it's right
there and that's it like there's there's
nothing else really to this build except
for the CPU fan and of course the
graphics card shroud so I'm hoping that
the graphics code has enough air of
being pulled into these bottom PCIe
slots that it won't absolutely choke
itself and then I think I mean despite
not having fans up front for intake I
still think that the CPU is gonna be
able to get by on the little amount of
air it's gonna need to cool the CPU just
by having a small CPU cooler I mean it's
a 35 70 right so it's not gonna it's not
gonna really demand high amounts of
power TDP s-- pretty low especially for
this generation so I'm expecting like
mid 70s or 80s which isn't too bad for
the CPU and then the graphics card
should stay kind of around the same
temperature range I'd say in the 70s I'd
be surprised if this was any hotter
under load again we'll test all of that
so let's get to the games first and then
we'll check system stability
alright that's powered on see how this
goes okay actually at idle it's not it's
not bad put the left side panel I think
it'd actually be pretty quiet is the
monitor oh that's lower this down a bit
okay hard drive not found you know what
I am an idiot I did not reconnect the
SSD SATA cable now this should you know
just realizes keyboards like smashed
over here that's a shame well good thing
is rebooting in Windows 10
and as far as I know this act this is
activated already so we don't need to
pay for a Windows 10 key which keeps the
price of the total system down honestly
this is a pretty sweet option like
you're not gonna have the most
up-to-date computer obviously the
platform is kind of a dead end at this
point I don't even know what motherboard
that is I'm not even sure what chip said
this is although I'm sure it's nothing
fancy but if you just want something to
game on and you have like no serious
budget you have to make some compromises
when you try to stick to this price
range in the new market so the use
market just gives you so so much more
especially under 500 bucks so that's why
I wanted to try this I really had no
idea how this was gonna like perform I
really I still don't I haven't tested it
yet but I do think it's worth
considering I mean a Core i5 4 cores for
200 bucks you know a whole system
basically I think that's a great deal so
the first test
Iran was Cinebench are 20 member the
scores gonna be a lot different than its
DaVinci r15 so don't try to compare
these with the older version but this
score was subpar to say the least I
think we scored just over 850 I believe
it was 867 somewhere in that range and
you're seeing it right now at times 10
speeds this is definitely a lot faster
than it was in real life and just have
four threads here four cores four
threads it's definitely dated in 2019
and showing its age I wouldn't recommend
this for productivity I would recommend
this platform purely for gaming if you
are on a tight budget next thing I
wanted to do was test the speed of the
SSD now look when a company is not
willing to put their name their brand on
a drive it's probably not gonna be that
great I had my sneaking suspicions and
sure enough this is a pretty terrible
SSD like 240 or so megabytes per second
for reads 232 for writes and things get
a lot worse further down yeah this drive
is dying for an upgrade although on this
tight budget I would say this is still
worth keeping it's much better still
than a hard drive which would probably
be around a hundred megabytes per second
reads and writes so yeah we're just kind
of stuck with us for now it could be a
lot better but it's certainly better
than an entire ISO I'm not gonna hate on
it too much next up would have to test
grandtheft out of five this is a game
that usually bodes pretty well for Intel
platforms and you can see here we're
getting
60 or so FPS a high preset 1080p and if
you if you notice CP utilization is
pretty much maxed out so we're
definitely CPU bound here you can see
every thread for the most parts at 100%
and our GPU up there top is around every
now and then it's pecking a hundred
percent but it's usually somewhere
around 70 or 80 percent and sometimes it
drops down to like zero and that to me
just says that the CPU is definitely
slowing things up the graphics card
can't work as hard so I actually decided
to frame scale and that's an option the
Advanced tab when you go into the
graphics settings for this game and it
actually didn't trash the the framerate
much at all in fact if anything it
offset the load more to the graphics
card reduced load on the CPU because the
graphics card is now having to work
harder and we just had a more balanced
system overall you can see quite a
number of places here the CP utilization
across all four threads drops to under
80 percent that's good I'd say the sweet
spots between sixty and ninety percent
you don't want to go much above that
because that's when you're really gonna
see the limitations of the CPU unfold
and affect your framerate so this is a
lot better I'd much rather see a GPU
bound scenario personally because it's
easier to mitigate those in my opinion
when you you know drop anti-aliasing
other things that are graphically
intensive maybe like grass foliage all
of that can affect your framerate and
and it's mostly limited by a graphics
card so in this case I'd say G and GTA 5
is not bad considering reusing a CPU
that is several years old and around 50
60 fps and 1080p for the high preset
mind you it's pretty good next up was
doom and look the Vulkan API is
beautiful I say that pretty much every
time benchmark this game I always try to
benchmark with Vulcan because I just say
I feel like the the the API utilizes
resources much more efficiently than
your standard DX 11 or 12 or even OpenGL
so in this case we don't have the MSI
Afterburner stuff on the left for some
reason it wasn't opening for this game
but we do have some info on the right to
look at a framerate for the most part is
into the 140 s 150 s which is really
nice this is the high preset in 1080p so
very pleasant you can see our
frame times there are averaging under 10
milliseconds which again if you just do
one over the millisecond that's your
frame rate so really good and yeah not
much more to say about this game this
game always impresses me just how smooth
it runs even on older hardware next up
was pub G and because this game is not
very well optimised I figured this is
where the system would show its faults
it stayed actually about 100 FPS most of
the time when we start getting into the
foliage the grass the shrubs of trees
that's my frame rate typically drops
below 100 FPS but this is the medium
preset here and that's still pretty
intense you know pub G's again not very
well optimised I try to say that every
time at benchmark at this game and yeah
so you're seeing utilization there on
the Left CPUs between 80 90 % that's
pretty good although most of the time we
are GPU bound so that is something to
note what we could do is just turn off
anti-aliasing a few other things to
compensate I usually drop foliage to
very low because that tends to help the
framerate as well but with everything
set to medium 100 FPS or so is pretty
good and surprisingly our CPU is not the
bottleneck last step I wanted to test
which are three as usual GP bound here
you can see GPU such up top is 100% I do
want to point out the temperatures
though for the GPU and CPU mid to low
seventies it's better than I thought it
would be especially for the CPU with
that cheap Dell cooler that slanted 15
degrees typical Dell fashion there but I
expected temps to be a lot higher than
they were despite you know not
overclocking I thought that just that
cooler wouldn't be enough with the Left
panel on but the temps are better than I
thought they would be another thing to
note CPU utilization for all four
threads in the mid-70s I'd say this is
very balanced from the CPU side of
course our graphics card is really going
to have to flex here to keep that frame
rate up and surprisingly we're in the
80s at this point right 80 FPS for
witcher 3 and the high preset 1080p for
a $400 system pretty dang good and
that's that's what you get when you know
you have a GPU on scenario like this
that's the really the graphics card is
the only thing that is going to
determine your frame rate unless you
just have an absolutely terrible you
know single core or dual core CPU in
your system so yeah this is a very
pleasant experience very good for a game
like witcher 3 so i'm
evident you were a little disappointed
with at least one aspect of this system
and that's okay it's okay to compromise
especially when we're talking about a
budget under five hundred bucks for a
perfectly viable gaming PC I would say
now for talking reliability the one
thing I would definitely upgrade is the
power supply the ones in here are just
gonna be good enough for integrated
graphics notice great card I mentioned
that earlier so we threw that 600 watt
power supply in here you get probably
get by with 500 watts we're talking
about an Rx 480
that's not even overclocked and a non k
i5 skew from a few generations back the
30 470 is a capable CPU again
bottlenecks quite a bit but it's not
going to choke the system out right like
yeah you might be CPU bound but your
frame rate is not going to be absolutely
terrible
I mean Intel CPUs in general tend to
give very smooth experiences unless
we're talking about you know super old
Celeron czar like Atom CPU who's you
know like those generations obviously
are not the best for gaming but Core i5
even five six years ago are still fine I
know plenty of people gaming on like
Core i5 2400 they're fine so the power
splay upgrade for sure first thing I
would do hard drive throw that in there
takes 10 seconds very easy upgrade the
other thing that I tried to do that you
might have noticed in the time lapse was
included gtx 1070 that would have bumped
this entire cost to around 500 bucks
I think the jump from a 580 to a 1070
for a hundred bucks is worth it though
if you can squeeze that out I think a
$500 build being able to get over 100
fps and 1080p and even sometimes 1440p
if you want to drop in game settings
just a bit more is a great great
solution for ballers on budgets and look
we've all been on budgets at one point
or another I totally respect those who
are willing to extract the most value
out of their dollar so that's it this is
our Dell Optiplex build and I really
want to know what you guys think in the
comments about this what you would do
differently if you had four or five
hundred bucks to spend on the best
system possible and many ways to spend
this money I've probably done budget
builds like really tight budget bills
like this one close to a dozen times
I've made videos on at least half of
those occasions and so you kind of know
what's out there and again use markets
always changing you got to be flexible
you got to find stuff that is within
your budget that you're willing to
allocate some money to without
compromising on other aspects of the
bill you know you put so much money in
your CPU
and money left over for your graphics
card so there's a fine balance there and
I figured I would try out new egg with
one of these old out optiplex systems
because first off I'd never done it
before and second off I wanted to see if
this thing was actually in decent shape
when it arrived now apart from the
keyboard had a big ship out of it I'm
not too concerned even though keyboard
was included I'd say this system here
overall being that it's refurbished is
in great shape and you get Windows 10
Pro loaded on it free already activated
well free but you know it's included in
the price which is nice because a lot of
these builds won't won't have that so I
would look for that for sure also if
you're gonna buy one of these systems
don't buy the narrow m ATX versions
because that's gonna mean that you can't
fit a discrete card in their traditional
1070 or X 584 he's not gonna fit because
it's not wide enough so I recommend
getting a full size M ATX or ATX case
ATX build like this one right here I've
linked a few options down below in the
video description most of them are from
Newegg and they are certified
refurbished I recommend getting all the
nests as a deed because that means the
operating system will be on the SSD sort
of be very fast versus having to
transfer everything from a hard drive to
a new SSD gonna be a big pain look if
there's nothing else that attracts you
to this bill let it be this alright look
in all seriousness I do really want to
know what you think about this solution
I know plenty of people actually on
Twitter who saw the original picture of
this build and were like hey I flipped
these like this is what I do it's just a
hobby I flip them on the side and make
some B's in cash I'm actually going to
try to flip this just to see how
saturated the market is here in Florida
at least my part of Florida and I'll let
you guys know how it goes I think what
I'm gonna do all-in I'm about four
hundred and eighty bucks so I mean
literally every part in here I paid for
out of pocket like there's not a single
part in here that was sent by a company
for free or for a review whatever so I'm
pretty much all in I'm on my own so
anything I make on top of that just be
gravy just be profit so it feels weird
asking more than 500 bucks for the
system because first off it doesn't look
that pretty but I I still want to try I
don't want to try to make maybe 50 bucks
or even a hundred bucks I might throw it
up there for 600 bucks and take like 5
20 or 5
for you that would be a $60 profit or
you know there abouts that's not bad
right and I got to make a video and play
with it in the mean time so I think it's
a win-win in my case and arguably for
the buyer I mean unless they want to do
this themselves which could take some
time to source the parts and put it all
together install the operating system
what-have-you
I think they're kind of making out of
thereunto so there's a little bit of
wiggle room there for negotiation and
I'll be sure to log that for you in a
subsequent video thumbs up if you liked
