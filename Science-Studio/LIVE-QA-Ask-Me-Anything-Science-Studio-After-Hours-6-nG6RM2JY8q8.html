hey hey hey sorry for the awkward pauses
in the beginning I like to make sure
that I'm actually live-streaming before
I start talking of course Lisa's doing
stuff beside me she's playing some video
games right now and we will be streaming
games after this to stick around if you
want to watch some gameplay and have
some fun it's nice to let off some steam
by the way if the audio is trash let me
know I like you know the guys that are
here early you guys are dedicated and I
appreciate that so let me know if the
audio is trash and I can do my best to
fix it like we had to do last time I
think I have the right settings but you
know I might need to tweak something
it's not gonna sound perfect because the
mics above me but it should be good
enough right to where you don't have to
turn your volume up too loud or turn it
down to low so again this is the same
exact format we had last week keep
things really simple we're gonna get
some sort of schedule system going here
soon we're live streams will be very
very streamlined and we'll have like a
certain way of doing things every week
but for the time being I think that
keeping things very straightforward and
personal you know just try my best to
answer questions in the chat is how
we'll do things for now I think it's the
best way to approach this while things
are still in the developing phase Audio
is pretty good okay cool
it's too low I mean some people are
saying it's pretty good some people are
saying it's too low so if it's too low
for those for you who think it's that
way just turn it up on your whatever
device you're watching the song cuz I
don't want to turn up too loud and then
those people who are already studying
their volume accordingly will end up
hearing me much louder through their
speakers it's better to work in hardware
software both Hakim
I think hardware is much simpler just
you know for a layman coming in I think
understanding the hardware side of it's
gonna be an easier approach I think
software is a totally different approach
to looking at how things work and why
they work right because it's harder to
picture software working itself right
it's just code for the most part and
having to memorize code so if those of
you out there are not keen on memorizing
things
it's literally learning another language
which I've tried it and that didn't go
too well I tried to C++ for a little bit
and a little bit of Java but not enough
to you know develop anything I just kind
of picked it up one day and tried to
teach myself and thought I would pick it
up a lot quicker than I did so hardware
is that one's gonna be tough
it's just cheetah you told me to sleep
it I'll watch for a bit I see okay we
were just chat chat on Twitter then I
appreciate it don't let me cut into your
school night though if you gotta sleep
school is more important again so make
sure you sleep the mic is on a Buddhist
turn on your speakers bro it's on loose
Lucy oh sorry if I mispronounced that
Luxio a says how old are you I'm 23 and
yeah I'm like right in the middle 23
right now I'll be out 24 in October what
tips could you give a 14 year old in
school stay in school that's first and
foremost I think if you keep school your
number one priority until you're 18 at
least you're gonna be fine you'll be
successful you'll find a way to be
successful and if you decide to go on to
college after that I would recommend
that for most people if you can if you
can afford it you have the opportunity
to go I wouldn't forgo it unless you
have some opportunity that you think
will bring you more value than a degree
would so it's you know it's gonna be a
personal choice but I would say school
just prioritize it above anything else
while you're 14 because it's gonna make
a big difference later on it really will
X takin thread Ripper I nine thread
repress said this multiple videos the
red Ripper is it just packs much more
value at half the cost of intel's 18
core equivalent why do you use why do
you do these a mas crispy because people
ask questions and that's why i do a mas
right because people want to have their
questions answered that's that's salami
it says it in the title video game
growing up my favorite one favorite one
was crash bandicoot my second favorite
was probably Spyro the Dragon and yeah
my third is more current I think GTA 5
is probably my third favorite no problem
Akshat Verma thanks for dropping by
anyway you have a
Sam to get to I encourage you to jump
all into that don't let this end your
your ability to study that is more
important by far Gregg is coming out of
the closet I don't know why you guys
insist on carrying that rumor over into
this livestream but that's uh that's
good to know
I'm glad she didn't hear that let's see
Justin Parrish do you have any thoughts
regarding AMD 2000-series leaks and or
do you have a be read anything about
them yet I usually don't touch leaks I
really try not to I just I'm not that
impatient I'll just wait till the thing
goes out till I can test it myself or
see other you know reputable reviewers
test the product but I think horizon 2
is gonna look pretty sweet
Rison mm I think that we're gonna see
over 4 gigahertz easy I think maybe 4.3
4.4 I'm expecting slightly under Haswell
overclocked ability like when you think
about the 46 and 47 90 KS you could
usually get those to about 4.5 maybe 4.6
year it's that would be like the upper
upper echelon I think for risin to I I'm
expecting you to fall more in line
between 43 and 44 hundred megahertz
favorite headphones open clothes I like
clothes headphones I have a couple bow
sets that I use that are really nice
sennheiser makes really great headsets
as well use oh man i play guitar
it's good at isolating the sound sounds
around you so you don't hear echo it's
just straight-up what you're playing
depends on the scenario really well if
your stuff Greg just want to say keep it
up thanks Erik Rogge arrow you have to
reply again and tell me how to pronounce
your name because that's a I could take
that three or four different ways like
is the G hard or is it soft like ruiji
arrow or interesting Soto's app says gtx
1050 TI or 1060 what should I get I am
gonna say it depends on what you want to
do with it I can't answer the question
for you when people ask me these things
I'm always I'm always like well you have
to give me a case like you can't just
say or ask the question without giving
me a scenario in which you would prefer
one or the other so I can answer the
question for you to be more specific
than that what do you think about
Intel's new SSDs frankly don't care much
about SSDs I really don't look too far I
know I'm like if I need an SSD at a time
I do my research but I
I don't really follow that very much at
all I don't think it's that interesting
to most people anyway
hey great hey gray my name is Greg but
I'll assume that you just did a typo
it's all good don't worry will your
friends fiance also bring content to the
channel later on I don't think she'll
bring content herself I mean there might
be a few videos where I think she's
better equipped to do or to present them
but for the most part I just want her to
kind of be either behind the scenes or
to be a part of the video I don't want
to completely this unselfish like I
don't want to completely replace myself
because I think people subscribe for
that person that they're you know that
they were used to in the beginning but I
mean she's super charming so I don't
think we'll have a problem with working
her into some videos and that's my goal
within the next 6 to 12 months she's
gonna be gone because she's not a
citizen she you know if she still lives
in Germany and and we're not officially
married yet so it's gonna be complicated
this next these next couple months but
we're gonna figure it out my favorite
vacuum I have a dust or dirt devil
that's double what do they call and
shark those are the two that I usually I
think they're the best bang for the buck
right Dyson is always upper-echelon and
under that you have like the Hoover's
and the other ones that try to compete I
usually go for one of them because
they're a little cheaper and they do a
great job still but yeah thanks to
Tucker bond for that $2 donation
appreciate that nice and wool may I
interest you in our Lord and Savior PC
Jesus Lisbeth Salander says what's up
Greg I know there isn't an exact short
to see which graphics settings tend to
be more GPU CPU bound if you have some
info on this could you do an end up
video I've I don't know if I've done a
video specifically on like which
settings really hammer your CPU and
which ones hammer your GPU but I've
talked a bit about how CPU usage affects
frame rates you could look into that you
could also just kind of the one thing
you want to keep in mind is if you
increase anti-aliasing that's going to
increase GPU usage big-time you frame
it's gonna drop heavy anti-aliasing is
the big one and then after a a if you
start boosting textures and stuff that
like make the game look pretty
you usually that's gonna that's gonna
offset your GPU leverage your CPU it's
gonna be weighted heavier if you're
increasing framerate by decreasing the
settings on the GPU so if you if you
decrease GPU leverage most of the time
you're gonna offset that over to the CPU
I don't have a video on that because I
think it's gonna vary from game to game
too much but in general AAA is the one
big one for GPUs textures and you know
foliage stuff like that but then if you
take those out of it out of the picture
usually you're gonna be more CPU bound
unless you have like a you know 20 core
behemoth diesen Opie Opie I see all that
I see it I see it I see Josh Berman
thanks to the $5 donation my dude ever
consider doing a used build with a Linux
OS for those under strict budget
constraints I'm the only time I've ever
worked with Linux ever was when I had an
old Chromebook and I flashed Linux to it
because I I don't remember if it was
remember what what oh s it was which you
know Aboriginal enix but it it was a
Linux OS and I flashed it over the
Chrome OS because Chrome was just so
restrictive I couldn't run any dot exe
and granted with Linux it wasn't much
easier but I had a little more
versatility with that I haven't used
Linux OS because I'm frankly not very
familiar with it I think it's way over
complicated for the average user just to
pick up and start using right away you
know it's all you have to you know type
in all kinds of lines of your commands
basically you type yourself for a lot of
what Linux does and I had to do that
with a MacBook granted it wasn't the
most intense stuff you could do but it's
not the easiest thing to just pick up
and roll with and that's why I haven't
done a build on it yet I use pcs I've
done those on the patch you can check
those out on the channel they're all
over the place but with Linux I you know
just buy Windows 10 off of kinguin or
wherever for 20 30 bucks you're gonna be
perfectly fine and I frankly in my
opinion I think an easier operating
system you use does you're out I have a
turbocharger Leonardo asks no it does
not it's a v8 the v6 supercharged ones
have a charger in them not a
turbocharger or supercharger is
different so the difference if you guys
don't know is I love cars I love like
figuring out how cars work right so the
difference tween a supercharger in Gen
because there are multiple types of
supercharged you get twin screw routes
superchargers and you have centrifugal
superchargers and turbochargers is the
turbochargers use the exhaust gas right
so that's that's why you have a boost
that kicks in at a certain rpm because
your your engine basically has two
output enough exhaust to spool the turbo
to then pull in more air it's a forced
induction right and then that air is
pushed into the engine you have a higher
oxygen ratio and then your engine pushes
more fuel into that mix to give you more
power right a bigger explosion if you
will that's how a turbocharger work
supercharger is literally the same
principle it forces more into your
engine but it uses your own engine to
turn that spool if you want to picture a
belt tied to your engine to your
crankshaft and as your engine rpm
increases that supercharger spins more
and more and that sucks in more air and
then you know increases your air fuel
mixture again more air is pushed into
your engine not more air but also more
fuel and that is how you get more power
out of it so superchargers usually have
a pretty like straight line right in
terms of power you get a lot of power
right away and then it kind of tapers
off more toward the upper end with
turbos is totally different it's usually
pretty flat and then you'll get a point
where that boost really kicks in you'll
see a sharp curve and the level off more
your higher rpms too so yeah there's a
quick little engineering lesson for
those who are wondering about the
difference between the two the s5 2013
and up only uses a v8 it's a v6 3.0
turbocharged not turbocharged 3.0 t I
don't know why they put T there it's
actually a supercharged 3 liter but
mine's the 2011 model and those were v8s
and then the cabriolets were v6 T's but
mine was a v8 ok favorite car - any
Nissan on the S chassis specifically
180sx with the sr22 ET i I'm I have a
lot of friends who have two 40s and I
like two 40s a lot I just I think
they're too old to be like you know
there's a fine line right you buy a
really old car because really old cars
you'll you know they feel vintage they
feel classic and that's why you buy them
but there's a certain era of cars I
think in the 80s right now or I don't
feel comfortable buying an 80s
generation car because the technology is
so outdated right but at the same time
it's not really a it's not really a
vintage like super classic car I think
by definition it might be an antique or
classic but it doesn't feel like one
like this does you know the older cars
like the 60s and maybe even 70s those
are the ones that genuinely are stripped
down they're pretty bare but that's how
they're supposed to be in the 80s 90s
it's a little harder to get that so I've
never really been a big fan of the 80's
90's or our cars I just really had the
only ones I really like or like the JDM
like the ricers rx-7 supra the NSX the
300zx
or ZX depending on where you live those
those are my favorites and that's pretty
much where it stops in the 90s I also
like the 90s era Ferraris like the
Testarossa fives Holt er trucker bomb
thanks for the donation my dude
three-fitty I mean tree fiddy 100 plus
her it's 4k welkins will consumers see
it in 18 or went I have no idea but it's
gonna be soon I mean look consumers if
you really wanted a 120 Hertz or 100
Hertz 4k panel they have them out there
they're just really expensive so you
know whether or not the general consumer
has access to them I think is dependent
on that consumers budget but 4k 120
Hertz already exists I'm sure they have
4k 240 in production but it's it's just
gonna be a lot more expensive so
whenever those prices get down to a
reasonable price I mean they're gonna be
a thousand bucks up for several years I
expect I don't think we'll have cheap 4k
120 Hertz monitors any time soon BMW m5
for the wind
cyber shark that's a good choice I like
the m5s I would prefer the m3 so just
because I don't like four-door
I don't like sedan sports cars like if
you're gonna have that much power to man
5 make it a coupe and then at that point
you might as well just get the m3 I'm
pretty sure they have the same engines I
want it I know the older ones did I
don't know about the newer ones
AutoCheck but that's how I see that's
why my car has two doors I think I'm
like well I'm gonna get like a you know
a sporty looking coupe it's like a like
a
whore in coop I want it to be a coop I
wanted to be a two-door car just makes
it feel a bit sporty er let's see
I had a 300 ZX turbo from 85 loved that
car dude that's a lid I have a buddy who
had one up think was like an 80 it was a
it was a little later it's like 90 I
think 90 or 91 fair lady and she was
nice Mustang Shelby what year mani what
year Mustang Shelby that's what I want
to know when will 8k be mainstream
that's asked by Julian Johnson aka is I
mean if you think about the law of
diminishing returns when you have a 4k
monitor that's about 28 inches or so
about two and a half to three feet away
from you maybe close to one meter you're
not gonna see any pixels it's gonna look
crystal clear from your view distance
going up to a K and around the same you
know diagonal screen size isn't gonna
change much at all in fact all it's
really gonna do in the long run is just
put more pressure on your graphics card
so I don't think it's gonna be
mainstream anytime soon a case I think
gonna be the application for a case on
bigger screens I would say 50 inches or
higher for computer gaming and stuff I
don't think any case gonna be ever
mainstream it'll just be an exclusive
thing for enthusiasts Dougy the gamer
thank you for the $5 donation my dude
going to college next year for
engineering don't like Electrical
Engineering so does that mean I won't
like Computer Engineering same for
computer science this is it's good
question they do overlap
you'll take classes at least in my
college you would take classes that
often swap between the schools so of
course you'll all take electrical
circuits you'll take transistor theory
you'll take AC voltage analysis all
those different classes leading up and
then you eventually a branch apart
electrical engineering is gonna be more
about I'm trying to think here and I
don't want to overstep because I'm not
an electrical engineer but when you're
in electrical engineering school you're
learning more about the components yes
you're doing a bit of coding I know
friends I had to do coding electrical
circuits classes and whatnot you do
logic gates stuff like that but it's
it's more or less theory when you get
into Comp Sci and computer engineering
you're gonna really dive deep in
the actual software and to do that you
have to know how to write software and
you're gonna have you know pages and
pages of homework of software homework
do and you're probably not gonna you're
probably not gonna want to do that if
you don't already like electrical
engineering because a lot of them do
tend to overlap so I would say kama is
gonna be more difficult than electrical
circuits Electrical Engineering in many
respects disclosure on if you saw the
previous video I my engineering degree
which isn't petroleum which is like a
it's like a mechanical engineering
degree mixed in with some some chemistry
a lot of geology so it's kind of a blend
of three or four different disciplines
but on the engineering side it's mostly
mechanical which is nothing like
electrical even though we both have to
take electrical circuits that's really
where the two roads diverge their mind
Nova says why you sexy I don't know
that's just I'm just shaking what my
mama game you know
golden gamer named the best GPU and CPU
for emulation go no idea what kind of
emulation what do you wanna emulate a
ps2 like you don't need anything but you
emulator ps2 on a freaking Intel Atom
processor so I need you to be more
specific there okay we scroll them back
up because I missed trucker bombs
donation here another five dollar you
just you're a patron just the patron
just just ask these questions like this
court I'll pull it up right now so you
have to stop donating you're already
donating every month to this to this
channel so thank you but you tell you
don't need to do that everyone should
retweet science Studios notification to
Frankel Josh and get him in here yeah
if Josh shows up I'll be pretty
surprised he's a busy dude but he's a
character he's a really cool shield
down-to-earth guy and he loves cars who
doesn't love cars so that'd be cool we
got him in here from the bay a 5y is
that gyro baby's is your Oh where's that
you're over pal
you're I should know that but yeah
probably appreciate that that's actually
like one point to what that's six bucks
thank you for that I appreciate it hey
Greg did you ever get a chance to drive
full speed on the Autobahn when you were
in Germany unfortunately no she talks
about it when she got to do it
but I mean she lives there but i-i've
been wanting so badly to take my Audi
there first off the Audi would blend in
like an s5 in Germany that's its real
a-hole right that's its birthplace it
would be so cool to bring it back home
and get to drive it where it belongs but
no I haven't we were in we were on the
Autobahn actually in her it was her
mom's like it was just just POS like
tiny little I don't even know what it
was
scooter it was a scooter yeah it was
just like the the smallest car and she
was booking it I was so scared that she
was gonna hit like a rock and we were
gonna go flying off the freeway the
audubon we say freeway here but yeah
that was really scary that was the only
time I've ever been on the Autobahn and
we were flying but I want to take my car
out there I think mine tops off at like
160 it's like electronically limit at
160 but it'd be still nice to go 160
it's around what - what's 160 mile per
hour
it's like 280 kilometers I don't know
let's see 160 mph mph to kph is 260 yeah
so 160 is 260 on it's easy yeah I'd love
to do that I haven't done it yet though
Jeremy are thank you for that donation
my dude Greg when are you gonna get a md
horizon apu is for testing look dude
I've been waiting I can pull up the
email these guys said they were gonna
send me APU like a month ago and this
all comes from the same I'm pretty sure
every tech tuber uses the same middleman
if you will so we don't it depends
we have direct contacts with AMD but at
the same time AMD usually puts a
middleman in there they're usually a
marketing company a distribution company
and they handle the sampling to channels
and my samples have been in the waiting
period for four weeks now and I keep
asking my dude like this is already long
gone you guys I'm already out of the
loop what's going on why haven't I
gotten samples yet and they keep saying
we're working on it we're sending we ran
out of them the first batch so they give
him the channels other channels there
some of them are much smaller but they
have there a list and then I guess we're
not on the a list so we have to wait a
little longer and that's all I can
really say I wish we
but we don't some kind of stuck just
yeah I would recommend the CPU or this
APU even though I don't have it yet I'm
just going off of what other tech tubers
have have thrown up they're just such
fara and that's really all I have is
just what they've what they've shown
Manny Quan thank you for that $2 nation
my dude I appreciate that
do you drop things like Linus does
golden gamer I've actually I mean I'm
probably not as clumsy as Linus but I've
done some pretty dumb things like I
fried a motherboard a power supply
thinking that it was the NZXT hue and it
wasn't it was just my I use an incorrect
cable of course I thought it was the
right cable and it was just pure
ignorance I've done that that was
probably like the worst thing I've done
I stepped on a motherboard completely
crushed some pins but I've recovered it
it was an MSI crate x99 motherboard and
I mean I'm like killed stuff like I've
done stupid stuff before I killed to
1080 T eyes and I have no idea how they
were both frumpy and why they were both
founders edition cards and both of them
stopped working and I sent them in there
like yeah it looks like the soldering
points around the GPU came up in a few
places and that's why it's not posting
I'm like what I've never done that
before what are you talking about how
did I do that and like well maybe the
PCB flexes when you apply you know water
blocks and whatnot I'm like I don't I
don't know how how that happened I've
never done that before and I've put
blocks on cards galore and this is the
first time both cards from P&amp;amp;Y that have
done this so I don't know what to tell
them but that's probably the worst of it
those three or four attempts there I
didn't really talk much about the 1080 T
is breaking because I don't even know
what the heck caused that I just know
that that's what they said was the
reason why they weren't posting what are
the specs on your main gaming rig check
out my most powerful rig to date Intel
ops that will answer your question let's
see I've been thinking about getting the
NZXT hue but I remember you having some
sort of catastrophic issue with it just
watch Cameron he was fine that has
nothing to do with the hue at all if I
think you that worked perfectly fine
even after it what was going on was I
had a molex connector from a different
power supply that I thought was for the
correct power supply using and I plugged
that in basically it was swapping I
think the five
he was going through the 12 volt lead
backwards and so we were getting
negative voltage on one run I had a
ground swab that's basically what
happened when I plugged the wrong cable
into the end of the PSU and what
happened was I fried a motherboard tube
no I fried two motherboards and a power
supply that's what ended up dying the
graphics cards were fine SSDs all the
good stuff course the cases are fine but
those three components ended up dying so
nothing to do with the hue I never had
anything to do with that and I made a
video basically apologizing to in 16
particular into the viewers saying
that's not you know my preconceived
notions were not true and I had to back
step there what's my favorite car
can you do top five okay Chuck wants to
know that I think my favorite car one of
them's got to be the McLaren p1 I loved
that car
I think all three the portion I'm 1/8
the p1 and the laferrari are really nice
car is really fast cars those are in my
top three just because they're so
beautifully built
I think the Cohen seg Agera R should be
up there because it's just the fastest
thing around and then fifth I'm gonna go
old school and I'm gonna say Ferrari
Testarossa you know because there's just
something so beautiful about the
Testarossa it looks so much different
than any other Ferrari out there I mean
like the you know some of them look
similar I think the 348 look pretty
similar and the 512 TR they all kind of
share the same body but really I really
like the Testarossa them v12 to come on
so those would be my top five I know
they're all over the place but is the
audio technica at2020 good I just bought
one $400 on sale of course it's good
Chubbuck you just um yeah you just gotta
read reviews do that'll answer your
question before you don't gonna ask me
that I use the twenty thirty five and
it's still very excellent in fact the
one I'm using right now is a Behringer
b2 pro this one's really good as well
it's a little deeper I think it's the
at2020 in 2035 there gonna be more crisp
and hey messiah i'm reading the chat bro
just because I'm not answering you
doesn't mean that you know I'm put you
on timeout that's what happens
put you some time off boom how you like
that now huh how you like me now this
guy's saying I read the chat I'm
literally getting all my questions from
the chat bro many consoles when you come
into LA LA or Louisiana I don't know
which my Karma
la not anytime soon I don't really have
a reason to be there
Louisiana that's my alma mater that's
where I went to school and I might be
going back soon
maybe I have to be there in December for
graduation I'm getting my MBA so I'll
get that graduation trophy basically my
degree that's really it it's Shelby
Cobra Daytona
well my dude okay let's see here we have
how you ever made a review on the old i7
3770k over the current Intel CPU the
8700 K can't see it and overclocked them
would you like to do a review on those
oh so you're talking about seeing that
the difference right comparing the 3770
to the 8700 yeah apparently the post be
really close to each other and that's
just that's how Intel does it right they
take tiny little steps improving over
time just because they can write they've
owned most of the market share for
decades and that is just something that
we've had to put up with that said
though I don't expect the differences to
be too substantial so interesting point
Jeremy our Tesla Roadster fastest
quarter-mile yeah but dude it's a
freakin electric car you're not going to
even hear the thing all you're gonna
hear is a little wind going over your
windshield you really want that in a car
that does is 0 to 60 in 1.9 as much as I
would like to go that fast that's pretty
incredible that the acceleration is
insane I don't think I would I would
pick that in my top five I would rather
take a freakin p1 and get dusted by a
Tesla Roadster and have my engine roar
in the background because that's what
attracts the ladies now who comes first
as much as it is the car that sounds the
best she's looking over here like I said
ladies let's talk him out would you take
okay I mean let's ask her I'm gonna
swing this around here okay okay
all right here just just just answer
this question for me would you prefer
your man that's me right okay all right
would you prefer your
man driving a Tesla Roadster that is 0
to 60 mile per hour in 1.90 200k roughly
1.9 seconds but it makes no noise it's
perfectly silent ok apart from like
little squeals from the electric motors
or would you rather have your man that's
me driving I'm driving on McLaren p1
okay I'm McLaren p1 as in like just I
don't even know the specs but it's it's
got a killer engine in there super sweet
it's a hybrid so it's got electric
motors in it too and it just roars but
it only does 0 to 60 and 2.4 2.5 you
would know not test our road that heads
la Rosa she thought I said testa Rossa
yeah or does it come down to looks she's
gonna pick the McLaren p1
look the Tesla Roadster is a pretty
sweet car but it's not I McLaren p1
I'm just gonna say it that's all I'm
gonna say someone asked how I manage
YouTube and other things while I do
school and whatnot and look you just
gotta sacrifice all your free time and
throw it into YouTube that's really how
you do it yeah but you'll hear those
tyres squealing dude oh that's just like
a high-pitched squeal that's like a
little girl scream right you really want
people thinking that that's I don't
think that's like that's not something
that you should want in the car I don't
think I prefer engine roar that's why I
got a v8 I think mine sounds really good
especially the exhaust in there and I
could not I couldn't do it your man
that's me oh yeah I got a reminder
sometimes she needs
oh yeah nothing wrong with that nothing
wrong with a refresher
Kyle B says nobody has cared nobody's
ever cared less about anything then
'wait want than her but I don't even
know what you were ask me
derpy wolf says damn it Greg why do you
stream on Sunday nights I have school ok
let me tell you it's 71 percent of your
week is a school night
okay so I automatically have only a
twenty nine percent chance of falling on
a day that doesn't fall on a school
night on top of that you know other
channels out there that are already
doing live streams on the weekends so
this is as best this is the best I can
do don't forfeit school for me I'm
frankly not gonna care less anyway I
just live stream because it's fun
talking to people who have the time if
you don't you can watch the archive
livestream later that's really all I can
say I can't help it that you have school
the next day I'm trying my best just to
find a time slot at this point is
everyone's live streaming all the time
do you think the fantex
end though evolve m ATX is a good custom
water cooling case I think it's got
plenty of room I think would be even
cooler though if you did the ITX version
of that case I think the m ATX is cool
but I mean unless you're gonna throw two
graphics cards in there like there's no
point even going mitx just go ITX and
fill the rest of the case up with you
know tubing and whatnot your larger
reservoir that's what I would do mah DX
is just such a weird form factor like
you might as well just go ATX at that
point unless you have like an M ATX
motherboard that's dying to be thrown
into a build
scrolling down you're scrolling down
here scrolling down here did you learn
any German from East from Lisa nadir
Halabi says or is asking that I know a
little bit of German I'm like probably
three or four phrases maybe a total like
fifty words that's about that's probably
about right how many words you think I
know fifty words in German three I said
three three sentence it's okay or she
says the reasoning or twenty under like
fifty words
flat flyer srr says did you ever give
your sister back the pink soap you said
was hers I left so hard on that video
section I'm pretty sure I didn't I think
I used it again like the next day to
finish some other tubing for a different
build i film a lot of my videos weeks in
advance some of them I upload like the
next day right but some of them wait a
while before they're published I think
that was one of the videos that took a
while to be published so it's kind of
funny that you still remember that
but I was thinking about I was like
literally filming I'm like you know what
they're gonna think this is my pretty
pink soap I gotta clarify this right
here Oh what do we have here a troll
says ma T X is a rich man's mini ITX
okay bro oh my god let's see here what
do we have I have I know a little German
- he works a little German he works at
the fact that was clever I like that
Razer headset or course their headset I
think that raised her head so it's a
little nicer in my opinion and I've
tried I actually paid for the Razer
headset and I'd prefer that one it feels
more comfortable it doesn't slide around
and rotate your head Devon Hernandez
asked Greg you live in Florida right yes
I live in Florida but I am CST not
Eastern so it's only ten o'clock here
Greg that new coolermaster m ATX case
the q3 and adele looks nice and has
amazing air flow try to get a sample q
300 l let's see looking at it oh okay
this is looking good this is looking
real good nice nice nice
okay so for those who are wondering I'll
go ahead and switch screens here so that
you all don't have to um let me see I
want you guys to see this it's a case
like it looks really nice I'm really
surprised okay
swing this over if you don't see the
stream itself display left all right you
guys getting that you see in this is the
master box Q 300 L and boy does she look
good I'm really really looking forward
to building in this I wonder though what
is that in the front it's a pattern
magnetic dust filter wow this is looking
weird you guys see in this alright now
you're seeing it this is looking really
cool so
the eye oh it looks like is on the left
panel toward the front which is cool
looks like two USB 3.0 ports now a power
button headphone jack microphone jack
and then a reset switch I'm assuming the
hard drive led is built into the power
button
maybe not doesn't really matter that
much and we have one two three four
slots and no basement that's the one
thing I'm kinda yeah no well maybe
Sika see you look there right the
basement this is where it really matters
the basement is not there but it does
have a weird graphics card support I'll
if you guys can see this right here that
graphics card support looks pretty odd
but I like what they're doing at least
it can prevent the sag the cool thing is
you can put a rate a reservoir up there
you have plenty space what it looks like
the up the other thing though is that it
just looks a little bare on that side I
don't know if I would want to do a
custom loop in here it's a cool idea
with the mesh though I actually like
that idea so let's see someone says set
my clock and now we're ahead it already
is an hour and we had daily savings last
night let's see here yeah this is
looking really cool I like the idea with
the mesh but that's probably where I'd
leave it I don't know if I would really
want to build on this just good like
there's no rubber grommets yeah I think
the outside they really nailed it the
inside though it needs a little work
just you know objectively looking at it
on this screen so I don't know that's
kind of like my two-second review of the
case but it looks it looks pretty cool
I'll give it that
trying to merge all these tabs in chrome
there we go
interesting looking so sorry for those
who are asking questions while looking
at screen I'm just curious about that
case because I had never heard of it
let's see
I really think though that people people
keep saying Dyson I have a serious
question here about to upgrade and was
gonna get our G wait I was gonna get our
GB RAM was one
oh it's growing too much I have I have
seizures and was wondering if much
flashing light would be enough to
trigger one that's a serious thing like
if you're that worried about your RGB I
am giving you a seizure and you probably
shouldn't be playing games so I don't
know if you're actually being serious
but I think that's you know I'm not a
medical professional but I think you'd
have bigger things to worry about the or
GB RAM unless you had to just flashing
on and off super fast
let's see gamer voice they should make
cases taller to make room for the fans
on GPUs and always have a shroud for the
PSU I think a PSU shroud is pretty much
a necessity but at the same time
something I argued about in my you know
2018 case revisions video I think that
more case manufacturers should move to
having the power supply at the the rear
of the case or the right side panel
because that still eliminates you know
the power supply being in the open aired
system on the left side so you're not
pulling in hot air through your power
supply and it keeps it isolated right so
it's pulling its own supply of fresh air
from the right side coming in coming out
it allows you to shorten your chassis
overall because really all you need now
space for rads may be on the top and
bottom and your ATX motherboard and it
makes it slightly wider so you know you
might prefer that you might not but I
think that having a slightly wider case
is worth it for isolating the power it's
by completely getting rid of the power
supply shroud and giving your you know
the left side panel just a pure clean
just presentation of your motherboard
graphics cards and custom loop gear if
you have that Linley's new PC oh 11
dynamic is looking really sweet I'm
about to get my hands and wants to stay
tuned for that what are we looking at
what are we looking at here
hi I'm building a new PC I'm getting a
GTX 280 but should I get an i5 or i7
also what is recommended to four reach
like i7 what is reckon four reach oh you
mean like the game I don't know I've
never played reach wasn't like Halo
Reach wasn't that like a Halo game
I don't know I'm probably losing my mind
but I don't know what game you're
talking about I would say if you're
gonna get a 1080 you should go for the
i7 just because
might as well take that extra leap
you're gonna really future-proof PC for
the time being
and if you're gonna get the i7 then go
with the coffee like i7 if you aren't
gonna go with coffee like i7 I would go
with a risin 5 1600 or even a risin 7
CPU you can get them for cheaper usually
and they're gonna perform within 10 to
20 percent of what the i7 is will and
heavily CPU demanded games em copyright
says do you think Intel will shoot
themselves in the foot by not releasing
the budget 300 series motherboards for
over six months now its Craigslist even
worth it now or wait from those six
months
o CL copy late sorry not Craigslist or
wait you know the six months for isolate
whatever the next revision will be I am
gonna say yeah if you're looking for a
budget Intel system it only makes sense
to wait because or to go with Verizon I
mean really Intel is kind of shooting
themselves in the foot because we don't
have those lower grade 300 series
chipsets we only have the unlucky 370
and that's what I was arguing about and
my think of as a video or two ago it's
just you know if you're gonna buy a log
to i-5 8400 like why would you spend
more money on an unlocked chipset when
you can't even overclock the CPU because
it's locked on the chip side it's just
like you're spending more money for no
reason you're getting extra features
with zi 370 but not enough I think to
justify the price hike so in my opinion
I would just avoid it I would go with
Rison if you're gonna look for a budget
Intel rig I think Rison is the better
value anyway is it worth it to shell out
$100 more for one of those gtx 280 USB
drives tyler Proctor I don't think so I
mean what like a USB Drive overpriced
what about r7 1710 atti 4k gaming I
think you'll be fine
like 4k gaming anyway your graphics
cards gonna really be the deciding
factor and a 1080p is gonna set you up
to 4k so yeah I think that config is
perfectly fine
Joshua K Greg would you like to dance
with me I totally would my dude but you
know I can't dance by myself so I need
you to be here if you want to dance with
me you wanted an someday yeah she does
I act like I can't but I know I can
when will RAM prices decrease is it
possible to know not really possible
really is gonna depend on how
regulations work out in China and
elsewhere Korea with price gouging
they're looking into that now and supply
to man right if you have enough supply
to combat the demand that's right now
taking over the reason why Ram prices
have been around prices RAM demand has
been pretty constant there's not like a
surge and RAM demand they're just there
hasn't really been and graphics cards
have had a surge in demand right because
of my name but we haven't seen that as
much with a gram so really this comes
down to a supply issue because of the
refinements with the newer architectures
and in-memory we have a shortage on the
memory side and part of this is
deliberate part of it isn't I mean they
are actually looking into this it's Rd
and they're developing actually already
have it developed but we're taking the
hit as a consumer because they're not
keeping up with that demand like they
usually do they have quotas they haven't
met them on purpose to keep the prices
elevated I don't think they'll go down
very much anytime soon sub Kids donates
$4.99 because you know I ain't worth the
full $5 I appreciate that one dude
what's going on 4k high refresh someone
I said earlier like that that's the next
step right that's the next thing that
we're all waiting on is 4k 100 120 Hertz
it's already here I mean that's that's
the thing like I want you guys
understand that sort of that technology
is here already people are using 4k 120
Hertz but not the mainstream consumers
right you can't go out today and buy a
4k 120 Hertz monitor for anything
reasonable of any price that you would
deem reasonable uh we're gonna be
looking at anywhere between fifteen
hundred to two thousand dollars for a
decent 4k 120 Hertz monitor look it's
just so many more pixels right 3840 by
2160 multiply those two numbers together
that's a huge number and then if you
take 1920 by 1080 right that's literally
one-fourth the number of pixels 4k is
for 1080p panels basically stuck
together in a wider rectangle not a
wider rectangle but a bigger rectangle
same aspect ratio that's sixteen by nine
so you have four times the pixels to
drive and at the same time you have to
have the
was refreshing 120 times per second
that's a lot of data to demand from a
monitor let alone a graphics card or two
that can keep up with that refresh rate
so even if it does become mainstream
it's gonna be I mean the average
consumer is gonna be so far left behind
with that even though Nvidia is
releasing you know and we're waiting on
AMD but Nvidia mostly leading the
graphics market right now even if we
assume they're releasing consistently
and we see huge jumps like we did
between Maxwell and Pascal which was I
mean we gotta give them credit there
that was a huge performance jump a 1070
equating to the 90 TI which was their
best card and then we had a 1080 from
Nvidia and then we had a 1080i which was
that much more powerful they really
stepped up the game and they stepped up
the the horsepower necessary right but
at the same time were we you know the
average consumers not gonna have all of
that I'm sorry about the phone by the
way I haven't muted my phone so I think
4k high for high refresh rates are gonna
be a niche thing for a long time and I
think that's why the prices are gonna
stay so high so you might not see too
many of them sleepy 21 with the $20
donation Mon dude you did not have to do
that but I appreciate it I got all my
water cooling parts
tomorrow I started doing it any tips
look I've got a few videos out there I
don't want to just leave it at that
though because you threw money at me so
I appreciate it
watch my tube ending video for sure if
you're going to use acrylic then be very
careful very careful pe teaches a bit
more forgiving but acrylic is it's
pretty tough I've tried to bend it a
couple times it doesn't work as well in
my opinion as ptg does it makes sure
that you have enough fittings already
ordered I'm assuming you do but you
might find that you need a few extra
things and it sucks to have to wait on
the extra components and just have like
a PC that's not working yet because
you're missing a few vital pieces make
sure you got all that have it all set
out go through it all right now because
buying it tomorrow first thing is gonna
be better than buying it you know at the
end of next week the next thing I would
say is make sure you have enough rad
space try to have at least a 120 mil rad
per GPU or CPU preferably though if
you're gonna have a single GPU and a
single CPU have at least a 360 mil a IO
at around 34
five millimeters thick they're gonna be
perfectly fine they're also watch your
fan curves because if you don't then
your fluids gonna heat up too much and
you won't be cooling your components
adequately and your fluid will literally
just churn the heat that your CPU and
GPU pumping out and they won't cool down
which isn't good in the long run for
your components thank you for that
donation by the way appreciate it
bear good it says OMG something I missed
it I have been waiting for a text all
night and it was your phone that went
off I am so sorry my dude son Lisa sigh
Craig just finished with my node 202
bill inspired by your bill awesome now
that was a late 2016 build I think the
problem I had is the hellfire nvme Drive
ran too hot 70 degrees Celsius do you
have any solution to this I have two
noctua f12
with 970 Strix any solution it's gonna
be hard to get cooling on in the vme
with a small form-factor case like the
note 202 normal I'm gonna check the
normal running temps though because I
don't want to tell you something that's
not correct I'm pretty sure the harder
the harder the drive runs I'm fairly
certain that's a good thing for I don't
know what that threshold is like when
too hot becomes an issue for an MDOT 2mv
me according to the 960 pro datasheet it
supports operating temperatures from 0
to 70 degrees Celsius every decent MDOT
to envy me it has an over temperature
protection so it will throttle at speed
if running too hot for my experience a
normal working temp is around 35 to 40 C
and around 60 to 70 degrees in heavy
workloads so to answer your question I
think that 70 70 C is okay as long as
it's not permanent it should be a
temporary thing when you're transferring
huge files right it shouldn't be that
way constantly when you're running games
and whatnot because you have buffers
right on your graphics card and your
system ramp to offset some of that
memory so it's a basically a quicker
transfer to and from your sources so I
would have to ask you if it's consistent
or not if it's always if it gets idling
at 70 that's too hot if it's just coming
to 70 every now and then don't worry
about it I think that's normal
oh come on my mechanical assistance joke
is awesome I missed it the shoot The
Shootist I missed it
yeah V sky that's hard drives though I
think he's talking about in in bout twos
nvm ease will run hotter than the hard
drives
unless you're answering someone else's
question do you play csgo professionally
no but she did not me I suck at csgo is
it okay to give me a shout-out skm vlogs
yes it is
here is your shout out my dude a BK 9000
hey Greg have you worked with E 5 Zeon's
for gaming no I've worked with a threes
I'm pretty sure B threes in the past but
not a 5s I don't think that a fives are
as valid for gaming because usually
those clock speeds tend to drop off too
much to where it cuts into your frame
rate to a degree that I'm not
comfortable with that depends on the e5
gen though and if you're getting it for
a really good price so value might be
there but performance overall usually
not gonna be as good unless you can
match the i7 the comparable i7 frame
frequency what am I looking at Eric
won't accept a Greg have you thought of
using or having vinyl decals for your
channel if so I'd like to make them if
you're interested someone's actually
already made vinyl decals and they're
sitting in a box and I haven't done
anything with them because I gave me
like 50 of them and so I put them on
builds every now and then you see that
vinyl decal right there that one is one
that he made me I have a vinyl decal
from Tony right there that it's
heisenberg's face so we have them around
I think I mean if you want to make them
you can just shoot me an email and we
can we can talk a little bit about it
but I don't really have much use for
them at this point because they're
they're so small right that you know
shipping them out really makes no sense
because it costs way more to ship than
it does to actually make the damn thing
so I don't know I think they're cool if
I had my own tool to make than I would
probably do it but for other people to
make them and then me have to distribute
them and stuff I just it's not worth it
they're so cheap is your refrigerator
running zombie civvies no who does not I
don't know what you're hearing right now
you might be hearing the clicking from
her next door but that's it she's not
doing anything really hardcore
have you ever considered delving into
xoc stuff very interesting in my opinion
I haven't but eventually I'm gonna want
to get into stuff like that I haven't
done it yet because I've been so buried
in this hardware but eventually yeah
that would be a cool way to diversify
the the content on a channel just a
little bit are you more in video or
Radeon I'm more in video at this point I
mean apart from the fact that all cards
are really expensive that are decent
I've I've been in video lately because
in video really is the only company
right now releasing graphics cards worth
buying I mean the Vega 56 was decent the
I should rephrase that because like the
DeLorean cards are kind of they share
market the Vega not Vega the rx 580 the
575 60 obviously those have a place
those compete directly with the 1060 the
1050 Ti and what not even the 1070 in a
few scenarios but for the upper end
stuff which and most of the stuff I use
this you know 1070 and up there really
isn't much to compete with those cards
other than big it 56 and 64 which are
impossible to get your hands on
basically and that's why I I am more in
video right now but I would like for
that to be the opposite at least for a
certain time I want them to trade blows
and right now they're really not doing
that I think the the mobile graphics AMD
has it maybe a slight edge in I think
that the APU has just released have
certainly a plausible existence just
because graphics for prices are so high
but that's really I think the extent of
it right now it's it's really tough I
mean yeah like someone says right here
the RX 580 was a good card from $1.99
excellent cards from $1.99 that was I
was recommending that over the 1060 for
the longest time because Nvidia always
had that right NVIDIA tax it was like
another 30 40 bucks to get the 1060 but
getting a 584 gig card for 200 bucks
that was really nice for a budget build
now it's sad but we don't have that on
either side mind you clerk inefficient
says hey Greg do you think mac OS is
better than Windows for software
development I don't develop much
software really at all so I don't feel
comfortable answering that question but
I know that my friend will you guys know
will he's my guy does a lot stuff behind
the scenes here good good friend of mine
he uses Mac a lot and he uses it a lot
for software development if I'm not
mistaken so he would probably say I
prefer smack that would just be like an
objective thing i what I've noticed is
he uses Mac more for that stuff
probably Mac I bought a my Vegas 64 for
five hundred ninety bucks you probably
bought it when like for a split second
it was actually being sold and able to
be purchased and then prices jumped way
up after that
Gregg's turning tricks still interested
in tech porn builds of course I am you
can always tweet me on Twitter if you've
got a sweet build be sure to do that and
I mean if it looks if I think it's
looking decent me not to be the
prettiest thing ever but I think it
looks good at all usually like it and
retweet it show up show it off to other
people download - oh sorry let me see
that watch is it Rolex finished this is
my s3 your s3 watch and it's still I've
I've liked smack this thing against
concrete steel beams and it's still
going strong
so I must tell you let's see here
PC master-race followed me what a boss
who runs the PC master-race Twitter I
wonder I wasn't following them though I
should probably do that okay there we go
cool and we have a new patreon okay cool
what are we shut up at that Robert s
tagging I think I said that right Robert
esta esta GaN he he pledged dollar on
patreon and I appreciate that like
anything bigger small is awesome if you
guys are willing to go out of your way
to contribute to the channel I really
appreciate that especially with the
super chats here as well like I know
it's hard to get attention on the chat
when everyone is chatting but I
appreciate it I really do all of you
even those who aren't donating and just
contributing with your questions thank
you for that
Matt devs asks is onboard Wi-Fi good for
gaming depends on your Wi-Fi strength
I mean if it's enough to you know not
see stuttering in games right network
lag then there's your answer it's kind
of self-explanatory but I've gave done
Wi-Fi a lot with onboard Wi-Fi cards
they don't seem to be to give me too
much of an issue as long as you're not
you know really far away from your
router is your three slot 1070 TI that
thick because it has a beefier heatsink
it is a slightly beefier heatsink this
is a question asked by just Chris it is
slightly thicker and it if you really
could be a two slot card but the reason
why it's a three slot card is because if
you only made it a two slot card then
the shroud from the graphics card which
is barely make its way into that third
slot on the bottom so if you put two
cards right beside each other you
wouldn't be able to do it because the
shroud is just a little too low so they
add a third slot it's like a buffer zone
right first off for adequate breathing
room and second because you literally
don't have that clearance on the third
slot so it's literally because it's
slightly beefier and yeah the card is
thick and it is like th ICC thick and it
keeps thing really cool it's a really
quiet graphics card really nice I just
wish it was cheaper so I could frickin
recommend it I can't even recommend the
damn thing because everything's so
expensive now on the graphics card side
but when prices come down when that
thing is more around MSRP it's an
excellent card I detailed it my silent
build by the way I almost pointed to a
card but this is this is live
one man writes this question what do you
think of all the YouTube science
channels sprouting pseudoscience I don't
know exactly to what you're referring so
I can't answer that question
this shoot-first thank you for that one
dollar donation my dude I appreciate
that
can you buy me dead by daylight you
shouldn't even know that game I feel
like I'm out of the loop is that a game
I don't even know what it is so I can't
buy 4e I'm sorry I got a 1070 GT 1030
for $70 congratulations Matt see
congratulations you might have been
better off though with a rise in the APU
yes maybe unless you already had you
know a platform you didn't want to sell
I don't blame you there Greg I sent you
a message on Facebook I entered an Asus
contest my entry never made it what do I
do
like I don't have the contacts that will
help you with that I'm the only context
I have or they're totally separate from
all that stuff they might know somebody
I can try for you but I really don't
know if I'm gonna be able to help you
out at all and I really don't want to
waste their time either explaining all
of this to them so I'm kind of an
I'm gonna write here my dude I want to
help you but I don't know who to go to
because my contacts are from a totally
separate department have you ever eaten
Burger King foot lettuce you know a
Burger King foot lettuces you know I
don't like a sling for somebody do it
I feel like foot lettuce is like
something like inside thing you guys are
all laughing right now
I have no clue have you been playing any
fortnight no she played a little bit of
and she hated it it's totally different
the pub gee it's like a cartoon and
there's different things that you can do
in there but I just from watching her
play I was like nah there's no way I'm
switching the fortnight what's up rub my
koala nice to see you
if it burns when you pee jab you might
want to go to a urologist that's
probably an issue that you should get
checked out my dude Jeremy love a lap
stark I mispronounced that says hey Greg
how do you clean your vert of your
racing chair I have the exact same one
and my pants stain the white on it okay
so this chair has a black centre I don't
recommend getting a white chair because
yes that will stain but this chair see
how the black is is taking up the whole
middle section it's just like this on
the bottom so I'm sitting on the black
part of the chair not the white part so
this really hasn't gotten dirty at all
how to clean it I don't know I would you
could use some like Clorox bleach wipes
maybe or some kind of like spray they
probably something special out there but
I would get that checked out first can
you review the new some guy just asked
if I can review the new and then he left
he just left me hanging thanks for that
bro
are you looking forward to the Freddy
Krueger game no idea no idea what that
game even is but I love Freddy Krueger
so maybe thanks for answering she ate it
um what am I seeing here what's the high
ii overclocked my rides in 1700 ex with
a 120 mil a io from jose Salas I would
say a 700 X I can get mine to about 3.9
gigahertz and no matter what cooler I
use it could be a 360 millio African
beefy like 250 watt TDP err cool
or even custom cooled I couldn't get it
to 4 gigahertz and I was on three
different X 370 motherboards so you're
probably gonna find that you'll get to
about 3.8 3.9 if you're lucky you'll get
to 4 but things are gonna run really hot
and probably really unstable
Rison gets really difficult and it'll
passed around 4 gigahertz or so gaming
laptops what do you think about it I
think they're kind of it kind of fits
the purpose I get that you want a game
on the go and that's cool but they're so
thick it's like carrying a desktop like
you might as well just freakin carry the
desktop with you and then plug it into
your hotel TV when you have time they
just they run really hot generally they
run really loud another getting better
but you know old-school gaming laptops I
really was not a fan of they're just so
big like we're talking several inches
thick and like why would you why would
you want to use something like that just
wait to game later or buy a you know a
laptop with 940 MX graphics or 1050
graphics and keep it ultra low-profile a
laptops meant to be portable gaming
laptops older ones anyway aren't
portable they're not very portable
anyway some guy says sorry dude I hit
enter by accident I'm on an iPad right
now I met the new fan Tex and though
case I missed it and though pro
tempered-glass I'm sure I'll get into it
at some point I I don't know I have so
many cases dude like I have so many
cases on the way I a couple from thermal
take one from Lee and Lee sided here one
from Aero cool it's gonna be tough
sorting through all the cases but yeah
I'm working on that working on it
scrolling scrolling scrolling I see here
a $14 and 99 cent donation because of
course I'm not worth the full 15 dollars
I appreciate the donation thanks for the
1 penny short I'll put that on your tab
noble hero number 15 Burger King foot
lettuce the last thing you'd want and
your burger King burger is someone's
foot fungus it's a fungus it's like like
like a foot fungus that's what foot
lettuces well that's all that actually
makes sense though that's why you would
call it foot lettuce my dude that
so you didn't have to donate $14.99 to
tell me that I could have just googled
it but like that's insane that's really
gross
thanks for the thanks for the
clarification but lettuce
it's like foot fungus but it's like
really bad like where you puts all
wrinkly and I'm like picturing in my
head right now that's really gross
I used to have that really bad by the
way I played soccer I was always playing
and you know what isn't Florida sorta
rains everyday here especially in the
summer and you know you wear cleats and
you were socks and sometimes you wear
two pairs of socks and it just it's not
good to have your foot like soaking in
that water and while at the same time
not being exposed to sunlight which
kills fungi so I usually haven't really
had a pig's foot really bad and I still
have to deal with it kind of it doesn't
look like what lettuce right my foot is
my foot lettuce that's really gross
that's thanks for telling me though now
I don't have to keep bringing it up it's
really nasty drove minutes like you I'm
picturing all of you guys really young
Rome is the i-5 okay with a 1080 I'm
getting one because I think the i-5 is
good enough for gaming though yeah if
all you're doing is gaming my dude then
you're gonna be fine with the i-5 if
you're gonna go with the i-5 though go
at the cannon or coffee like i-5 the
older i5 s 7600 K 6600 K those are gonna
be borderline because there are only
four core chips with the 8600 k you do
get those two extra cores and I proven
in my most recent video that it's enough
for gaming with really no fps Delta
let's see what do you think of the idea
of a high end bacon stuff bacon stud
says please record this new time it's
gonna be archived on the channel you can
watch it whenever you want like you
don't have to record a hit unless you
want to post it somewhere and then by
all means the hot shot I missed it hot
shot asked a question scrolling up
scrolling up nope I missed it I'm
scrolling down again here we go
hot shot 240 asks what do you think of
the idea of a high end horizon power at
APU something with 20-plus Vega cores it
may need to be made with for the tr4
socket because of the die size but it
could still see use in servers I mean
yeah
you might be able to make the case for
servers but at the same time I mean what
you don't need servers that's iffy I
don't know if the application is really
there for a and B to just be like all on
board with that I think if they saw a
you know utility in that they would have
already done it
I I don't know yeah you would definitely
have to jump with dye size for sure I
mean you see those four or eight mega
course however many are in there right I
think 2,400 has I just did this Vega
chorus he's a bigot 2000 G have 11 yeah
they go 11 so there's 11 bigger chords
in there and those things are just
packed into that die so you know that if
they jumped up to 20 Vega chords they
would have to increase the size in the
die and they would probably jump to them
to the tr4 socket but then they would
have to I don't even know they could use
a tear for soccer because that's
designed strictly for for those risin
chorus right I'll tie it together with
the Infinity fabric so I don't know if
that's even possible
I mean look just jumping from you know
there's a 7800 gear this the 7700 K to
the 8700 K required a new motherboard
right and all they did there essentially
was sandwich two extra cores another die
changed a few things with power
delivering whatnot but for the most part
the same thing and they had to
completely change chipsets so they'd
probably have to do the same thing again
and I don't know if it's worth it you
know getting the manufacturers and the
motherboards on board to release a new
CPU like that that ultimately not many
people would use because it's really
only valid for servers then even then I
would say yeah let's see
hey man excuse my English this is from
scientists the scientists do you do you
know why cooling system GPU are so bad
out of the box and why the GPU cooling
aftermarket is so under exploited by
brands some of the aftermarket you're
talking like AI B's right so like some
aftermarket graphics cards are gonna do
an excellent job of cooling I don't
think that they're under exploited I are
underutilized I mean if I some cards you
can't really overclock much more even if
they're AIB cards so I think what your
grass
is why they don't do that I don't think
that they don't do that I think that
they try to get as much performance as
they can the reason why some of them are
underutilized because they're all been
to an extent but some of them are better
been than others and so like example for
EVGA right they'll put a for the win or
for the win to cooler on and for the win
to PCB right because they make custom
PCBs for these cards to they'll sandwich
the GPU and one of those and then you're
you know you're gonna still have some
variance there so just because they're
all for the win two cards they're not
all gonna overclock the same though
overclock excellently because they
passed the mark to make it into the for
the one category but some might still
overclock more than others what EVGA
does is say okay all of them are getting
to this frequency so we're gonna set
out-of-the-box frequency that this if
you can get more breathing room then
that's good for you but we're gonna keep
it to where it's all out of the box the
same because not all GPUs overclock the
same they're all been differently that's
why they're not all utilized to their
max potential it's a little bit on a
little bidding tutorial there but that's
why they're staggered the way they are
they google chrome greg flipping
crabcakes you should get another car to
track or drift in yeah it would have to
be a rear-wheel drive car my car won't
drift at all I have tried I fishtailed
it once and I hauled it around a corner
and then it grabbed right act like the
all-wheel drive system and the Quattro
system is so beautifully engineered in
the s5 and almost all Audi's is that way
I got the Rio sport differential so the
torque vectoring and all that's all
taking place back there and it's really
just grabbing and it knows when you're
turning corners and stuff to allocate
power to the outside wheels a bit more
than the inside wheels because they got
to turn a little faster right so you get
that extra grip it's just such a smart
system and I really can't find a way to
outsmart it to get it to to you know to
slide just because it's such a heavy car
and it's all-wheel drive eventually I'll
get something else that's more drift
worthy but I've been thinking I wanted
to get a Camaro then Jay got a Camaro so
I'm like well there's nothing I can do
there now so I'll find something I want
to get an rs5 next but that's not really
a drift car either
so we'll see what comes up see flier s
RR s has added an extra penny for
you-know-who my dude making up for that
loss I appreciate that
he stepped in and saved the day I'm no
longer I'm actually still one penny
short so yeah you know keep that in mind
it's the one someone else shorted me one
penny I'm a little bitter about that
I'm Greg look up ahead eceive NM f5
please it goes 301 I know Julian I trust
me up all this stuff cars I follow a lot
that car is freaking beast and it looks
really mean - it doesn't look the best
to me but it looks pretty mean that's
kind of what they wanted to go I mean
when you name a car then I'm right it's
gonna be pretty sweet-looking
let's see what am I looking at what I'm
looking at here cyber shark he says rich
boy but he doesn't realize that my car
cost less than a Honda Civic I love that
when people are like oh you must have a
lot of money cuz you bought a out es5 at
the car costs 20 grand
it's really not all that impressive when
it comes to price especially people are
impressed by how cheap it actually is
for the value so you can call it like I
see it but Cavs asked if I enjoyed foot
lettuce I really don't enjoy foot
lettuce
I hate to break it to you but I really
don't doesn't sound too inviting you
really didn't on paper that's why I
thought was something worse frankly than
athletes but but that sounds pretty
gross still on its own let's see I am
looking at I've watched enough initial D
to know that four-wheel drive is great
for drifting but an 86 won't lose to
them four-wheel drive is OK the guy I
would not may be drifting on like dirt
dude drifting in a four-wheel-drive car
period is difficult it's a lot more
difficult than a rear-wheel drive car I
can tell you from experience I don't
know why you think that's like great for
drifting I say you probably better
drifting with a front-wheel drive car
than all-wheel drive car just because
you're gonna have a difficult time
getting that thing to slide I take that
back it'd be more difficult with
front-wheel but still front with
four-wheel drive is nowhere near as
optimal in rear-wheel drive so I think
that's an overstatement Hunter Johnson
says what would in your opinion be the
best type of
Engineering career to pursue that
involves arts or designing I think
mechanical sounds like it's right up
your alley dude I would consider
mechanical because you can do so much
with that it's so applicable to so many
different things so many disciplines you
can design whatever you want with a
mechanical engineering degree and you'll
know why it works the way it does so
that's the one I would go for Jeremy Rx
is great you should look at kiya stinger
LOI just kidding I thought it was a joke
when I first I don't like the way the
kid stinger looks like my friend looks
pretty good but it's a Kia first off
it's fast but it's a Kia and I think the
rear I think they just butch I think
they butchered it I really could have
looked so much better at the back and I
don't I just don't like the way it looks
Brock Bollinger you asking what type of
chair it's a vertigo chair my dude and
what do you think about the new way
controversy I've been reading up on it a
little bit watched Jays video about it
and it's I mean I don't know it's it's
something I noticed I mean like you used
to get a lot of different perks with new
way that you don't really have anymore
and that's when I stopped using them I
started buying everything from Amazon
because I started having to pay tax and
that's you know that's a big downside to
using granted now or starting to have to
use tech we're starting to get taxed on
Amazon too and it's just because of
where they have sorting facilities and
whatnot now the rules are changing so
they ought to be taxed but that was why
I originally stopped using new egg and
it's just been kind of I don't know the
whole thing is just a little I don't
really know who to blame specifically I
think a lot of different things wanted
to play there so I don't I don't want to
jump to conclusions and say it's this
person's fault or this company's fault
or this state's fault
I think was it Vermont or Connecticut
that had the issue so it's something to
to look at and tickity looking at
because it might affect other states in
the future Jeremy lebay thanks for that
$5 Canadian donation I appreciate that
thanks for interview I guess you got my
name right Labe did I say that
Jeremy Libby cool I was talking about
the white on each side of the chair
since I said the exact same one I don't
have an issue with that I don't touch
the right I don't touch the sides of the
chair like if I'm sitting in this chair
right now and my
jeans are not touching the whites on
either side he might be a little wider
than I'm pretty skinny but if you're
touching the sides and rubbing it back
and forth and stuff I saw a few people
said using some vinegar and maybe like
some Clorox bleach or something just go
easy on it right cuz this is like a faux
leather and you don't want to wear it
away or anything but you just you know
just try different cleaning things it's
it's this is pretty tough stuff it's not
gonna get destroyed I don't think if you
use something like that
let's see someone else says Kayne seer
Sierra's can i get a shout out there is
your shout out my dude ax to one of our
moderators says hey just curious besides
other tech youtubers what other channels
do you watch on YouTube I watch a lot of
Doug De Niro can't get enough of Doug
Damir I love his car reviews i watch a
lot i watch a lot of politics just
because i like i usually like watching
things that i disagree with on a
fundamental political level because it
either helps me solidify my argument put
a little italy or it persuades me to
think differently about the other did
you know the topic i guess i should say
so a lot of political stuff i watch a
lot of car reviews Doug de Muro I always
bring him up he's a really good guy and
just tutorial videos that's really the
big big three categories or things that
I watch and it's pretty spontaneous too
like I don't have a thing I keep going
back to it every day in washing I'm just
not that kind of guy alright a few more
questions my voice is getting so dry
right now we've been going at this for
just over an hour and 15 minutes or so
we're gonna end at 11:00 p.m. CST which
would be 12:00 midnight so those who
were in high school age and who want to
go to sleep could get school tomorrow
high school middle school whatever I
won't keep you too much longer you
should get some sleep school is more
important than this boskie says for $2
to nation thank you for that love your
videos and pinion on the Grand Tour I
watched the first season it was cool I
feel like they tried a little too hard
they kind of forced it some of the
things they did had
to do with cars and I was just like okay
like that one thing where they had to it
was like the third or fourth episode
where they had to go in there and act
like you know Mission Impossible and
scope people out and I had to do it like
50 times because they kept messing up I
was like you know it just felt like a
filler like they were trying to fill up
time I wanted it to be more about cars
I haven't even watched the second season
frankly because I was kind of
disappointed with that play out on it
then again though I mean Jeremy is a
frickin genius presenter and so are the
other guys all of them really they all
bring a different personality to the
table the Jeremy's that he really
spearheads it and I'm really glad that
they have the opportunity to make a show
like this at Amazon gave them light
opportunity I heard he's difficult to
work with sometimes but I mean I'm sure
the guys got an ego he probably deserves
someone but I I would you know I don't
take that in consideration when I'm
watching him I think it's just a great
presenter in general the greatness for
he donated a dollar ninety nine you
assured me another penny my dude we're
really now I'm sure two pennies this
this is my days ruined thank you for
that I think for the donation what would
you expect or recommend for a one
thousand dollar PC build I have that on
the channel it's somewhere I don't want
to spend too much time on this because
I've already answered that in videos but
thousand dollar build you can put gtx
1060 or 580 you can get it for a decent
price put a risin 5 cpu in there maybe
rise to 5 1415 or dex if you can step it
up to 1600 fine but don't kill yourself
trying to get to that mark get yourself
a $60 case $100 motherboard SSD 120 gig
hard drive and power supply for 50 60
bucks you're all set
Ram would be a different issue start at
8 gigs for now buy another 8 later on
it's still fine for gaming it's
borderline but if all you're doing
scamming that's gonna be plenty sorry
for that my voice is getting destroyed
right now
that's 9:23 a.m. you're on the other
side of the world my dude thank you for
watching sir off Kumar Roy Chowdhury
thank you for the donation I don't know
what currency that is but I appreciate
it
Oh from India okay cool hey man a
Productivity tips I have a few
productivity tips so you talking about
just like for rendering I don't know
what
I'm out like productive and what you're
talking about content creation and
whatnot you just get a flow for things I
have a system a way of doing things that
really works for me and I've you know
I've been trying to get least some more
into this stuff doing stuff behind the
scenes just to practice and she has her
own way of doing it and that's how
you'll find like everyone's gonna do
things differently and sometimes it's
difficult difficult for me to let go of
my own trends in my own you know ways of
doing things she's nodding right now
it's I get really anal sometimes for
bigger reasons just because I do think
the certain way you know it's hard to
let someone else take it over especially
when you be doing for so long but you're
gonna have your own way of doing things
I think in general productivity wise
it's subjective there are ways to speed
up your you know editing and filming
processes and whatnot but just come up
with a system that's really what I would
do just just get a system way of doing
things and you'll fly through it
okay mr. squishy - dollar donation thank
you for that I was given a 96 Subaru
Legacy wagon Aero wagon all my dude do
it please that's Oh would you please
send pictures I want to see what that
looks like mark and puff $2.99 course
you're all gonna short me a penny and
alcohol complain about a bunch of trolls
out there thank you for the donation I
appreciate it YouTube is incrementing
every $0.99 that's why oh really what
that's so weird
let me see I'm see if I can super chat
myself no I see two dollars your bunch
trolls I just confirmed it that's a good
try though
good try mark and pop good try the
greatness I wish I can get a ten sixty
at my local fries it's $600 I'm
surprised your fries even has a 1060 the
fries we went to in Vegas didn't even
have any that's incredible I think
that's just outrageous I kind of like
what Micro Center is doing with you know
bundling with other components to make
sure it's not going to a minor and
that's cool and all but the supply still
is so low and even if it did get higher
I think it's gonna be pushed out and
waves and it'll look lowered like an
artificial supply shortage just to keep
prices up for a bit because once those
prices draw
then it's gonna be it's gonna be really
hard for the manufacturers I think
because everyone who used their card for
my name's and I try to sell it and pass
it off it's just like a gaming card
you're not gonna know it was mine with
unless they're upfront and disclose it
and and that's gonna cut into new
graphics card sales that's my prediction
anyway making sure it it miss sunny I
see you guys questions I see it you can
do sense yeah you can do sense but I
think it's gonna be like a minimum of
like 99 cents or something like that
what do you think about computer
engineering I think I talked about that
in my video my engineering video go back
to videos and watch that brainpan Kevin
Ruiz what was your GPA in high school I
graduated with a four point six to five
in high school
Jackie says question when do you stream
live do you still need to upload the
video to YouTube for later no it's
automatically archived in on the channel
for few it might take a few minutes to
go like to actually be on the channel to
view after the fact but it's always
there unless we take it down for
whatever reason Papa I missed it papa
Ibrahim ah my bulge did you get a
physics or an engineering degree I got
an engineering degree it's all of you
tale out of my engineering video guys go
watch that if you have any question
about engineering at least it'll give
you a brief overview of my experience in
it talk about the math classes and what
not and if you should consider it what
kind of person it takes to handle those
classes so go watch the video if you
have any more questions on engineering I
see a lot of engineering questions in
here so go ask go check out that video
first I would say let's see scrolling
down a couple more questions we got
about one or two more minutes here and
then I'm gonna call it I appreciate it
the 300 or so viewers who are watching
thank you for that it is uh it's no it's
no small feat really to have this many
people watching and I am humbled by it I
appreciate the devotion you guys have on
a Sunday night to watch the livestream
or Monday morning depending on where you
live my I'm well I really need a bring a
water bottle with me excellent my voice
is destroyed don't worry oh you do have
okay hmm let's see here
Clinic see you I'm not buying you a
video game bro
oh we have a t-shirt giveaway I forgot
about that you guys are here probably
wondering why I haven't brought up a
t-shirt yet so we are gonna give away
one of these t-shirts if you guys are
watching I really what is this I have a
stain on my t-shirt it's still there
it might be chicken from earlier today
that's embarrassing anyway you can get
one of these t-shirts right here just
for watching the stream I'm gonna give
away one of them but if you want this
t-shirt we have it in four different
colors plenty of sizes if you have you
know an extra large figure maybe you're
a two XL or three XL click the link
below it's a genius link it'll take it
straight to Amazon and that's where you
can order one so we're doing all this
stuff via Amazon which is pretty cool
they basically print them per order I
ordered mine here in the States and it
took one day for them to print it and
then they shipped it out and I got it by
Friday after ordering on Tuesday so
you're gonna get them really quick they
print to order and the quality is really
really nice I'm impressed with the
quality of this shirt really that was a
big thing I was concerned about was like
if the shirt was gonna be trash and
we're selling these at costs we don't
make a single cent on these don't think
I'm pretty sure in $14 and like 85 cents
or whatever that's basically the per
shirt cost so because we're not buying
in bulk the price goes up a little
higher because they have to have people
you know manually doing this but for
$14.95 I think it's one of the cheapest
like tech shirts on YouTube being buy
right now we're not in it to make a
profit again
basically all the money goes to Amazon

1485 we don't make a penny on the
t-shirt sales so click the link below

these because Amazon handles all the
logistics we might know like a number of
purchasers but it doesn't really matter
for us cuz we're not gonna make any
money off of them but if you do buy a
t-shirt or end up winning a t-shirt or a
patreon it's gonna get a t-shirt for
being a patreon because tier 3 donations
result in a t-shirt so we're gonna send
those out brace ooh and they've been
waiting for a while then tweet us a
picture a picture of you wearing the
t-shirt basically and I'm gonna retweet
that and show it off to all the other
followers on Twitter
