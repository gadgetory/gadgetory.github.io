description for more details
a little disclosure upfront I do have an
engineering degree it's why I feel
comfortable enough talking about this
subject I got it from the University of
Louisiana here in the United States and
my concentration was petroleum which
overlaps with mechanical and civil
engineering to some extent as well as
chemistry in a few places we all for
instance had to take thermodynamics
fluid dynamics statics and mechanics of
materials and electrical circuits so the
general core engineering classes I
graduated with a 3.8 GPA and only
received one C while in school we'll
talk about that later but mostly A's a
few B's so the first question people ask
me about the engineering program is how
difficult the math was right this is a
valid question for sure stem programs
often require the highest level of
mathematics and this curriculum was no
exception you'll want to take care of
your algebras geometry and trigonometry
as soon as possible I recommend in high
school if your high school offers those
courses just because it tends to hold
students up in college and prevent them
from advancing in their engineering
courses sooner and as far as college
maybe your goal should be to advance
through the curriculum as quickly as
possible the sooner you graduate the
sooner you can start making money and
that's kind of a point after all right I
took calculus one in high school and
again my first year in college as a
refresher and I'm glad I did this covers
primarily derivatives and limits there
are these simple concepts to grasp but
long form problems can be a bit
difficult so if you do your homework and
ask relevant questions you should get
through this one without a hitch my
bigger issue was calculus - that was the
next required math course in the
curriculum here the emphasis is
integrals essentially the opposite of
derivatives
issue isn't so much the concept it was
more or less the multi-step process that
was required to arrive at the correct
answer so one incorrect step and
depending on the professor or TA you
could end up with no awarded points
I received a B in this course my first
test grade in fact was a 51 and I picked
it up to a 91 the next test followed by
a 96 and then an 82 on my final because
for some reason they feel like throwing
all their finals in on the same day
which is never good for any student
trying to cram last minute they're just
kidding don't do that the next math
class was differential equations my
professor wasn't the greatest but I had
several mathematicians on YouTube to
help me along the way it's one of the
reasons why I got into YouTube in the
first place I wanted to teach people
what I was learning I ended up with an a
after again bombing my first test I
don't know why that was a recurring
theme but yeah I adjusted after the
first test or so something else I had to
take quite a bit of in school with
statistics for some reason I had three
in total one with an emphasis in
business and the other two in theory and
application stat is a different kind of
math altogether and shouldn't be as
daunting in the long run as calculus one
two and three I'll say this in closing
about math and the engineering
curriculum if I can do it you can too
and I'm not just saying that because
it's the right thing to say it's just I
was never really great at it I was
pretty average just determined to pass
and keep my grades up and as long as you
have that drive to and study and do your
homework
you'll be able to make it through as
well my brother is actually the math guy
I don't really have that I don't know
that gene I guess some people are just
wired to understand math and pick it up
so quick and that was not me it took me
you know two or three hours to pick up a
full concept and then to again apply it
on paper in homework problems took
another two or three hours so yeah about
a full day's worth of studying would
would get me to where I needed to be
after that lesson in class at this point
though the roads diverged if you are
interested in computer science or
electrical or software engineering it
becomes a very different ballgame than
traditional mechanics so engineering was
always about reciprocating forces right
energy transfer is basically how we
manipulate those transfers with machines
but electrical engineering and
corporates topics that are very
difficult to conceptualize at least for
me transistor theory for example DC was
easy but AC analyses were always
stumping me it's vastly different from
what
Kanaka engineering major would study in
his or her fourth year and that's why I
recommend thoroughly reading up on each
of these concentrations before declaring
a major these are life and death
situations here I'm gonna go off script
for a second and say this about the
difference between mechanical
engineering and something like
Electrical if you're a very hands-on
person you have to see it to understand
it the mechanical engineer is gonna be a
bit more tailored to you I would say if
you are just a numbers guy and you can
pick up languages or patterns very
quickly Electrical Engineering is gonna
be more your thing it's I don't know why
it plays out like that it just does it's
how we conceptualize these topics I can
say from the few courses I took that had
like an electrical engineering emphasis
to an extent but it was not the topic
for me my dad's an electrical engineer
and I always thought it'd be cool to do
what my dad does because if he's good
I'll be good at it right but no not at
all I am much more visual and I like
having my hands on things that I'm
actually learning about and it's
difficult to do that with electrical
engineering because everything is like
digital or it's you know in a circuit
you can't really do anything with that
with that said though the one C I ever
received in my entire life I received in
thermodynamics and I think I received
that grade because I had a professor who
consistently talked about his
accomplishments at NASA and who
neglected to talk about the relevant
topics to put into our tests so yeah I
would go into the test with absolutely
no knowledge about a chapter and I would
have to use common sense kind of reason
my way through some of the subjects in
other cases my brother and I both would
have no clue how to work out problems of
course emailing him is impossible
because you know he's got a hundred and
fifty students to worry about at the
same time so our email gets washed
through the spam folder and we're left
with nothing but our own devices and
Wikipedia which ended up ultimately
saving my grade prevented me from
failing and it's sad to lean on a
website like Wikipedia but that was
really the only way I could
conceptualize some of the topics that we
were supposed to discuss in class and
this ties in with something else that
you should consider how much time and
effort you're willing to put into your
college degree if you expect to flow by
with minimal effort and care into your
work then you shouldn't be an engineer
you shouldn't even be in college if you
ask me but I'd much rather you waste
your time in the business field for
example where it's much
easier and where you won't be able to
physically harm anyone from neglect or a
lack of knowledge in my field in
particular there are several warning
signs when drilling and producing that
we learn about in school failure to
identify any of these could result in
something similar to what happened with
Piper alpha this is something we all had
to learn about in my concentration
167 people died on account of an open
condensate injection pump you don't know
what that means
just know that gas leak throughout the
rig resulting in several explosions
these are a life and death situations
the pursuit of which in any university
should not be taken lightly but that
said several colleagues in my class
alone never even bothered showing up to
class or studying for tests their grades
reflected this behavior though a few
were still allowed to pass look my point
being a business major who really messes
up one day on Wall Street isn't gonna
kill 167 people at least I hope not but
in the engineering field this happens a
lot and it's pretty sad but it usually
happens through neglect or from not
knowing what you're doing
so should you consider an engineering
degree well if you're watching this
video and have high hopes for your
future then yes now look I don't mean to
scare you from anything I've talked
about this video and I'm not saying that
everyone should go to college of course
they're gonna be people who decide that
College does not have necessary value
that they see in it the utility that
they are desiring and they're gonna
forego that for some other career path
some other option and maybe they'll be
more successful without the degree than
if they had it but if you're considering
college in general then you probably
should go to college just because you
already see value in it right enough to
consider it and I really think that that
can be the deciding factor between
getting a job and not getting one many
jobs out there require college degrees
regardless of how stupid they are you
know they could be a stupid as
basket-weaving but if you have a college
degree that's all that matters so
playing the game to an extent yes
matters look that piece of paper really
doesn't matter at the end of the day for
a lot of people out there who are
looking to hire so you know something to
consider just because I have a college
degree doesn't mean I'm any more
intelligent than anyone who doesn't have
one it's just something that I'm proud
of because I didn't have to do it but I
did it in order to set myself apart from
other people who might want the same job
I do like anything else is an investment
worth making in my book and I don't
think you should be afraid of the math
in particular if you're dedicated to
in practicing the material I'd say the
best all-around engineering degrees are
mechanical and electrical just because
you can take those really anywhere but
the ones with the most potential and
highest salaries are generally the more
specific ones like software chemical and
petroleum engineering and despite not
using mine at this point in time I don't
regret my pursuit of it it's a great
resume builder so if I decided to be
something else in the long run I'll have
that on my belt under my belt in my belt
how do you how do you say that so what
is next for me graduating December with
my Masters in Business Administration
I'm working on that right now online
it's a great program through ul and yeah
I'll be graduating at the end of this
year what I'll do with that degree who
knows I might never use it in my life
but that's okay but it's more or less an
insurance policy that at least is the
goal but I will say for the time being
I'm very happy doing what I'm doing now
creating videos for all of you for
alternately being my own boss at the end
of the day getting to be in control of
my own destiny how much money I make is
ultimately determined by how many views
I receive on videos and being creative
is what determines how many views I
receive in videos so it's it's a drive
for me and it's something that I don't
think I'd have in the regular work force
this is a very unique opportunity I
think for all of you from making it
happen speaking of which this topic
today that I just filmed this last
minute I brought it up because someone
asked this and in the live stream we had
last night so every Sunday night we have
a live streaming session that we call
after hours and I usually try to keep it
pretty casual we'll do some weird things
every now and then where you can call
and ask questions but it's ultimately
gonna be a Q&amp;amp;A every week so you guys
have a chance to ask questions get to
know me more on a personal level if you
want and maybe have your specific
questions about your rigs answered in
the live stream so thank you for whoever
asked this question I forgot who it was
but this was a really interesting topic
and I do receive this question a lot
which is why I decided to answer it in a
dedicated video like this one speaking
of which if you like this video be sure
to give this one a thumbs up I
appreciate it thumbs down for the
opposite click write subscribe and if
you have already stay tuned for more
