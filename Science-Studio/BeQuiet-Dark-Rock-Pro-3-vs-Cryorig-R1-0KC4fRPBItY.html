advance for any background noise you
might hear there are dogs barking people
are over I'm trying to push this video
out before Christmas Day it's still
Christmas even here in Florida but we
only have a few more hours to go so I'm
trying to try to finish this one up
quick but there is a lot of info to I
guess go through in this video I'll be
comparing the cryo rig r1 which is a
beefy enormous cooler with the dark rock
pro 3 from be quiet which is also a
beefy enormous cooler each have their
pros and cons as expected I have my own
preference I'll discuss that at the end
of this video but what we'll be doing is
putting these on the same platform
they'll both be on top of a 5820k
overclock to 4.6 gigahertz and 1.32
volts
it'll be an open air test bench so it's
these aren't the temperatures that
you'll see in an enclosed case but
nonetheless every variable is exactly
the same the only thing I have changed
is the cooler in each of these runs
you're going to here you'll see thermals
you'll hear the just a sound test how
loud each gets under full load and at
idle and then we'll just go through some
aesthetics how difficult it is to
install each of these coolers all that
will be discussed in this video here we
go
so we'll be discussing several qualities
with both of these coolers I do want to
first mention aesthetics go through each
of these looks like in general what you
should expect out of the box in my
personal opinion the dark rock pro 3
looks better it just does it's sleek has
a nice black hue to it throughout apart
from the be quiet logo on both of the
included silent wings three fans you'll
also find a nice plate up top with the
company logo or something I think all
manufacturers of large coolers should do
it just makes them look better more
refined you have you know a very large
heatsink in your case it helps to have
something covering all that mess just
something sleek and conservative like
this my personal opinion I prefer it and
as for the cryo rig our one totally
different approach when it comes to
aesthetics it's not my personal favorite
I do appreciate the white accents makes
it look a little more ostentatious if
you will this cooler is just about brute
cooling capacity dissipating that heat
from the CPU that's really all this
cooler is worried about not so much
about the way things look in the case
although I'm sure some would find it
more appealing than the dark
Rock Pro threes you'll find a thin
profile 140 millimeter fan up front
followed by a standard 140 sandwich
between both of its heat sinks both of
these massive coolers include seven
large heat pipes the are ones are
slightly larger and are nickel plated
copper so the dark rock pro 3 and the AR
1 are different in every way except for
the fact that they're both extremely
large air coolers what I personally
found when I tested both these coolers
is that the be quiet dark Rock pro 3
resulted in slightly higher core
temperatures just slightly I don't know
if it's going to matter to you it's not
that big a difference we're looking at
86 degrees Celsius encore 3 which is the
hottest core for the dark rock pro 3 and
84 degrees Celsius for the Keurig r1 I
ran the r1 by the way after the dark
rock pro 3 so I mean if you're worried
about I guess the CPU being torture
tested for several hours on end the r1
went second so of anything that one
should have resulted in higher core
temperatures we didn't see that though
the r1 actually did come out on top when
it came to heat dissipation but there's
still a chance for the be quite dark
Rock Pro 3 to make a comeback be quiet
dark Rock Pro 3 that is such a big name
big name for big cooler suppose when it
comes to how audible each of these
coolers is under load and at idle you'll
find that the be quiet cooler as you
might have expected already is
significantly quieter especially under
load have a listen to the sound
comparison
so this is my personal scorecard thus
far it might not agree with yours but
this is how I'm seeing it at this point
the cry rehgar one is the better air
cooler when it comes to heat dissipation
that's kind of the point we got lower
core temperatures it wins that
undoubtedly I'm even get two points for
that but the be quiet dark Rock pro
three looks better in my opinion give
that point to whichever side you think
looks better and it's quieter that's a
big deal for a lot of people another
point there for the be quiet dark pro
three so and on maybe I'll give one of
the are one for having a shorter name
but at this point it's two for two we're
tied in my book let's keep going
installation-- another big concern for a
lot of people how difficult was it to
install both of these coolers what
you're looking at right now are the
parts that I needed to install the be
quite dark Rock pro three and this is
all I needed to install the crier with
our one kind of get a sense of where
this is going the dark Rock pro three
was a pain to install it just was and
that's that's how it is I had to take
this tiny little wrench that at least
they included with the cooler and kind
of weasel my way around the the nuts to
get you know it screws onto the bolts to
keep the cooler secured to the
motherboard
I actually had to remove the front fan
in order to secure the cooler that was a
pain it took like 30 minutes the
acquiring are one much simpler process
it was beautiful if I could take the be
quiets design the way that the cooler
looks and merge that to the cry we are
one's easy installation process you
would have the perfect super large air
cooler so with the cryo rig our one now
in the lead in my book at least the last
thing we should discuss then is price
and the r1 is still on top I'm using new
egg as a source for this video prices
are always changing so do keep that in
mind but right now you can buy it for
about 75 bucks whereas the dark rock pro
3 is selling on the same website for a
$20 premium of 95 u.s. dollars every now
and then though be quiet is like a
massive sale on all of their gear if you
can find the dark rock pro 3 for around
the same price as the r1 in my personal
book I'm saying all day go with the dark
rock pro 3 you might get a few extra
degrees worth of core temperatures out
of it it's not a better cooler than the
ORA one and
regarde but it is significantly quieter
in my opinion looks much better so if
those things are concerned for you the
dark rock pro 3 is the way to go
something I didn't show you earlier on
though both of these coolers are able to
cool a CPU better than a 240 millimeter
AIO that's something special and worth
noting so unless you're planning to
custom cool your PC which will set you
back hundreds if not thousands of
dollars these two coolers right here are
the best on the block trust me if you
get your hands on either of these
coolers you'll see exactly what I mean
they're heavy their bulky I'm struggling
to just hold this thing up with one hand
but they do the job extremely well I'll
say one last thing before I end this
video if you're worried about price I
know 80 bucks is a lot for an air cooler
consider this you could purchase a 240
millimeter AIO for 100 bucks easy
right but you should worry about pump
failures possible leaks maintenance in
general they're typically loud the pumps
themselves are typically loud or you
could purchase something like this that
requires virtually no maintenance apart
from the fans if the fan dies whatever
just replace it no big deal and
something like this or the dark rock pro
3 especially is very very quiet just
food for that give this video a thumbs
up if you thought it was cool ow I
stabbed myself bad that the motherboard
is sharp on the bottom capable to give a
thumbs up if you thought it was cool
give you dislike if you feel the
complete opposite or if you hate
everything about life be sure to click

already about shredded my hand there
