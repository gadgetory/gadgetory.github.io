studio we have yet again another intel
skylake bill for you only this time
we're upping the ante if you're
interested in spending a bit more than
the I would say bare minimum for an
excellent gaming PC then look no further
we'll show you here how you can build a
gaming PC that can run most titles in 4k
Ultra HD for a modest $900 so let's jump
right into it at the core of our build
is the Intel i5 6500 the CPU that's a
part of the new skylake lineup now right
off the bat I know what you're thinking
why not offer the 6600 K if we're gonna
stick with quad-core CPUs well I came to
a crossroad here actually and honestly
either path you choose will leave you
with an epic gaming PC so you can either
go with the locked i-5 6500 like we've
done here and throw the extra savings
into a better GPU or you can opt to
settle on a cheaper graphics card for
the pricier unlocked I 5 6600 K keep in
mind though that if you decide to
purchase the 6600 K you will also need
to purchase a custom CPU cooler because
Intel doesn't supply you with one but
that makes sense I mean most stock
coolers don't do the job anyway when it
comes to keeping an overclocked CPU cool
so maybe a Corsair or into the XT liquid
cooling unit will likely also need to be
purchased just keep that in mind now in
our case because the i5 6500 that we're
opting for is not unlocked its hefty 3.2
gigahertz quad core architecture will be
cooled with the stock Intel fan no
problems there following suit with the
locked nature of our build is the
motherboard and in this case an LG a11
5-1 be 150 MSI gaming board will do the
trick
since our GPU is locked in immediate
upgrades are likely non-existent
considering how much we're gonna be
spending upfront for our CPU a locked
p150 motherboard which only means that
you couldn't overclock the CPU even if
you wanted to do just fine the nice
black and red curb appeal of the board
is also quite pleasing to the eye so for
the RAM we've chosen the same ddr4 26 66
megahertz Pan Ram 8 gigabyte kit that we
chose for a $600 build the memory speed
of our RAM unit
this point will only produce marginal
returns in the form of frames per second
we don't recommend paying a premium for
super overclocked RAM and so you've
ventured into i7 territory the law of
diminishing returns just plays too great
a role here we've gone with an Intel 535
series SSD for boot drive and a Seagate
Barracuda one terabyte hard disk drive
for general storage the Intel 535 packs
quite a punch boasting 540 megabits per
second of sequential reading speeds and
490 megabits per second of writing
speeds if you're still doubtful about
the benefits of switching over to an SSD
even at least for the sake of a boot
drive let this graph persuade you
otherwise compared here are the
Photoshop cs6 and Adobe Reader 11
opening times on both a 7200 RPM hard
disk drive which are barracuda is and a
micro SATA SSD which are Intel 535 is
expect your boot and file loading times
to be cut in half with this SSD we've
chosen for the graphics card the
gigabyte geforce gtx 970 takes our cake
sporting roughly 4 gigabytes of vram and
an overclocked core speed of twelve
hundred and fifty three megahertz this
beast of a card will run most titles in
4k at a modest 30 FPS if that won't cut
it for you downgrade to 1080p gaming and
enjoy superfluid FPS rates approaching
80 to 100 FPS for most titles gigabytes
a windforce edition of this card packs a
three fan punch as well for optimal
cooling and quiet gameplay you'll also
have access to two DVI ports three
display ports and an added HDMI port so
just let that sink in for you who want
four monitors display it all at once
no problem here so in light of our
heavy-duty graphics card you might be
thinking wow I'm going to need a sizable
power supply to feel all of these next
parts right well wrong our Intel 6500
has a load wattage rating of 95 watts
combined with our nine 70s 310 watt draw
under load our system will likely only
require around 500 watts of power at
peak demand using my simple power supply
calculator
500 watts times the safety factor of 1
point 5 equals 750 watts which leads us
to the power supply we've chosen an EVGA
supernova 750 watt 80 plus bronze
certified power supply not only will
it's bronze rating save you a few bucks
every month on your power bill this
version of the PSU sports a semi modular
interface meaning that you'll only need
to hook up extra cables if you need them
NCIX is deal after a $20 mail-in rebate
is $64.99 and arguably irrefutable price
now as we've said before the case to any
build is likely the most objective piece
as well
we chose the NZXT source 210 black in
color and sporting a nice window on its
side so that you know you can peek at
all the goodies any case with the
reasonable airflow should do as long as
it's an ATX mid tower size or above that
supports full ATX motherboards don't
worry about finding a case with radiator
mounting support as it would be
absolutely absurd to liquid cool this
log cpu it just doesn't make sense so
with all the parts now listed what's our
grand total so not including shipping of
which the case is likely the only
culprit should you desire that free
shipping option on the other parts
listed in this build the total price for
this competitive gaming computer is nine
hundred and twelve dollars and sixty six
cents now we should note there aren't
too many extra corners you can cut here
sure you can opt for a cheaper graphics
card but you've been doing your quad
core processor and injustice and much in
the same way settling for an i3 or AMD
FX CPU will likely bottleneck your gtx
970 and while you could opt for slightly
cheaper ram will make the case that the
extra ten dollars for faster memory is
worth the additional
or FPS and games so that about wraps
things up Black Friday and Cyber Monday
are lurking in this series of videos is
meant to inspire you really to build
your own PC this holiday season and
there's really no better time to
purchase the required parts than now so
thanks for sticking around and stay
tuned for our highest budget gaming PC
build featuring the Intel Core i7 6700 K
and a crazy fast GPU but if you're a bit
more budget conscious and concerned
about saving money to spend elsewhere
check out our previous budget bills for
$600 a modest price indeed this is
signed studio thanks for learning with
us</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
