it I am dressed up currently as a
college student and I expect I'll be
dressed up as a college student again
tomorrow what do you know for today's
video we'll discuss what exactly the
phrase is a GPU bound and CPU bound mean
in regards to video games it's a
question often asked by those who build
their own computers after assembling a
list of parts one typically decides in
the back of his or her mind which
component will be the limiting factor
either the graphics card or central
processing unit that is after all what
being bound means this term is unique
because unlike fixed parameters it
changes with respect to in game settings
games that run at very low resolutions
and high frame rates will usually result
in CPU bound scenarios and titles run at
high resolutions and lower frame rates
they're trade-offs will typically be GPU
bound by nature of their architectures
more on that here but how would you go
about assessing your own personal
situation how would you properly
diagnose whether your GPU or your CPU is
holding you back
welcome to the crash course playlist
without sugarcoating anything or
dragging this video out there is one
surefire way of determining whether or
not your CPU or GPU is the limiting
factor download a program like MSI
Afterburner or NC X T's cam software and
enable both GPU and CPU percent usages
in their drop-down menus
step-by-step guides on how to do this
are linked in this video's description
whenever you open a game with these
presets you should be able to see them
in some corner of your screen usually
the top left I've simulated three
different examples with my own personal
rig walter white version 2.0 it's
sporting an i7 69 hundred K octa-core
processor at 4.4 gigahertz 16 gigabytes
of ddr4 and two gtx 1070 s boosted to
eighteen hundred and twenty megahertz in
sli from just hearing these
specifications which segment of my
computer do you expect will be the
limiting factor again it all depends on
the game here is our first scenario this
is witcher 3 running in the 1440p
resolution at max settings across the
board the game looks beautiful with
everything on and according to our
framerate my apologies for the
unnecessary overlap is well above the
60fps threshold ignore
though these are inaccurate but do take
a look at our CPU and GPU usages first
and foremost we notice that both
graphics cards are being heavily
utilized staying well above 90% for both
this is typically an indication of being
GPU bound our CPU usage verifies this
it's only utilizing one fifth of its
full processing potential and isn't even
getting very hot with this game without
a doubt we're being bound by our
graphics cards even though we have two
gtx 1070 s in here they're essentially
being choked used to their fullest
potential z' for a game like this
jumping from 210 70's to 210 80s would
be the ideal thing to do given how much
CPU headroom we appear to have that on
top of the fact that most games won't
fully take advantage of anything more
than about 4 physical cores but there
are cases in which the i7 6900 k that's
right folks a $1000 processor is the
bottleneck can you guess which game I'm
referring to in particular Tri City
skylines notorious for its aggressive
demand of CPU horsepower it'll choke the
life out of any situation when dense
populations and heavy mods are in effect
which is the case here just check out
our frame rates are you kidding me sure
we're running mac settings in 1440p but
this is a $2,500 computer and I can't
even push above 60fps what garbage is
this it's called poor optimization for
one have a peek at our second GPU usage
it hasn't even passed ten percent since
the start of this run this tells me that
cities isn't SLI optimized and is
essentially ignoring the second graphics
card big waste of money in this case but
wait Greg how can you say this is a CPU
bound title if it's only being stressed
to around 30% there are two reasons for
this actually keep in mind this one
here's for overall CPU usage it's
basically an average of all CPU
utilization in the case of Witcher 3 all
cores were moderately used but in the
case of city skylines three cores are
being stressed to the max while the
other five sit at bay hyper-threading
does help in this game as i've proven
here but it doesn't change the game's
architecture this can be verified by MSI
Afterburner control hub which monitors
independent core usage I know three is a
weird number but that's what we're
getting here so our CPU is being maxed
out but only on a few cores this is
entirely dependent on the games API
encoding the other way to verify that we
are in fact CPU bound take a look at GPU
usage whether we're zoomed in or out it
doesn't really matter
GPU one rarely exceeds 50% while GPU 2
is practically non-existent this is
typically indicative of a limiting CPU
whether it be the result of a CPU itself
or the game's architecture no matter
what I do or where I hover in this game
I'm being bound by my central processing
unit this may be a one thousand dollar
chip but it isn't being used to its full
potential
an i7 6700 K while less than half the
cost of the sixty nine hundred K would
be more ideal here since that CPU still
packs enough cores to be fully utilized
but with higher individual core
performance of course using a more
powerful GT X 1080 singular would also
help our framerate here okay so you've
seen what a GPU bound scenario looks
like or GPUs in this case and you've
also seen what a CPU bound scenario
looks like but is there a middle ground
can you find a good balance between GPU
and CPU usage in any given game to be
fair you'll always be bound by one or
the other there is no such thing as a
perfectly balanced system with that said
however when the two work together in
harmony you'll see your frame rates
increase as well as overall smoothness
stuttering should be non-existent in
frame rate should be constant and high
with respect to your native gaming
resolution incomes dying light while
this one undoubtedly favors Nvidia
graphics cards the developers made no
secret of that just look at their intro
it plays very well on Walter white
version 2.0 check out our usages both
GPU 1 and GPU 2 are being utilized about
the same this is good indicating
excellent SLI optimization and CPU usage
often pegs above 50%
I don't expect dying light to utilize
all eight cores and sixteen threads of
the 6900 K that would be a bit crazy but
50 to 60 percent usage tells me that
it's actively using the industry
standard and that's for physical cores
for modern gaming while I would normally
consider this a CPU bound title for the
simple reason that replacing my 6900 K
with my 6700 K yields slightly higher
frame rates thanks to higher single core
performance our graphics card
utilization is still relatively high
indicating a healthy balance between the
two departments when it comes to
selecting parts for your new gaming PC
ask yourself what kinds of games you
intend to play do a bit of research into
what those games and generally leverage
more either the central processing unit
or graphic
card and base your component choices on
that obviously it wouldn't make any
sense to pair an i3 6100 with a Pascal
tight next I really hope you didn't do
that you'll likely be cpu-bound in
almost every game at every standard
resolution but the difference between an
i-5 6400 plus rx 480 and an i3 6100 +
gtx 1070 in terms of frame rates will
certainly vary from game to game doing
this research beforehand could save you
a heck of a lot of buyer's remorse as
well as just pure sheer frustration city
skylines I am looking at you if you like
this video be sure to give it a thumbs
up give it a thumbs down if you feel
good opposite or hit every button to
