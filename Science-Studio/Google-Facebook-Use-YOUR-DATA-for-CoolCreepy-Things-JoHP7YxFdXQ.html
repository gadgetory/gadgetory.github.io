things behind the scenes scary but kind
of cool now if you're a tech junky
you'll probably appreciate the
refreshers here but anyone nude this
sort of thing may never end up trust in
the internet or their cell phone ever
again so what kind of things am I
talking about hold your breath
many people take agreements in contract
with a grain of salt for example if I
enable Google location services on my
LGB 30 I understand that Google's gonna
track me from time to time right
or maybe it's all the time it's why this
feature actually ends up draining many
phone battery signals are constantly
paying from the source and time
intervals from various satellites or
cell towers update your position with
some trigonometry and calculus in real
time this data is then however sent to
Google in our case where it's used for a
variety of missions purposes one of the
coolest in my book is Google traffic
it's also pretty creepy I guess I should
say location did it send from millions
of phones across the world are all sent
to Google several times per minute where
it's processed and used to calculate
traffic conditions this is all by the
way listed in the agreements that you
agree to when you download these apps in
short the bulk of users and cars with
typically Android phones using location
services or changing locations over time
right so Google knows the distance
traveled per interval time and can then
calculate the rate at which various cars
and moving per section of road they have
millions of phones to access so for
instance of a car with an Android phone
inside travels along a section of
Interstate 10 and only moves 30 feet
between communications which are let's
say every five seconds then in Google
can approximate an average velocity of
four miles per hour or roughly six and a
half kilometers per hour Google knows
this is a freeway and assigns a red
congested color to this stretch of road
based on the number of users in front
and behind experiencing a similar travel
delay of course nobody in the right mind
would willingly go four miles per hour
on a freeway
it's unobtrusive for the most part apart
from battery stress which is why I'd
label this one more cool than scary this
was also an oversimplified example but
you get the point and by the way Google
isn't the only company doing this
they're just the best at it let's move
on to Facebook a company that seemingly
sprung out of nowhere as the social
media platform currently used by over
two billion people that is pretty
incredible but much like goo
Facebook uses its user data and
unorthodox and intriguing ways also some
pretty creepy ways for example Facebook
uses its messenger application to track
all user locations down to a few meters
on a consistent basis it's one of the
reasons why this app has been known to
drain smartphone batteries it's also why
Facebook decided to separate its primary
application from the messaging interface
it separated user permissions and
allowed for a dedicated location service
if you think about it's kind of smart
because most people aren't downloading
an IM application expecting to be
tracked day in and day out but it's one
of the reasons why Facebook decided to
split it from the parent application but
worse than this is what Facebook
actually does with this location data
since it relies on targeted advertising
as a source of income a big source of
that income the company actively and
consistently collects user data across
various websites and various locations
completely unaffiliated with Facebook
itself in turn the application allows
businesses to target you according to
your demographic makeup and lifestyle
down to the very square footage of your
home yes
Facebook can do that it doesn't just
stop there by the way according to
targeting data Facebook allows
businesses to pinpoint for example
soccer moms persons who plan to buy a
car as well as a style and brand of car
you currently drive users with X number
of credit lines open your credit score
and those who prefer NCIS over law and
order if you visited any web site on any
browser after logging into Facebook
regardless of whether you've done it in
incognito mode or not listen closely to
this one
Facebook still has access to that data
and likely stores it in fact they can
run around your browser entirely and
access your ISP servers directly for of
course a small charge one of the perks
of being a big company it's also why
this core user was so confused and
surprised when he noticed Facebook was
actually retargeting with relevant ads
after searching for products in
incognito mode
Facebook's a fun one to pick at because
its users are often so unaware of what's
going on behind the scenes with their
data how do you think it knows when you
appear in an untagged photo for instance
how does it know that it should
recommend you to be tagged if it's your
face it maps your entire face based off
previous photos you've attributed to
your likeness and uses predictive
analyses to better gauge potential
product audiences for interested
companies it can predict things so well
in fact that it's even successfully
guests childhood crushes based on poses
and photos and comments exchanged
between parties and unrelated posts if
that's not creepy I don't know what is
many believe you're also being listened
to I have to stress this one's not
confirmed but there are some pretty
creepy reports out there many reported
relevant ads for products about which
they've never even posted a message to
anyone here's just one example how does
something this specific end up in an
advertisement if you've only spoken
about it literally spoken about it not
posted it anywhere there are several
videos about this very topic by the way
several experiments that I've linked in
the video description just something to
watch after this if you're still
interested in the topic Facebook
strongly denies this claim by the way
stating quote we don't and have never
used your microphone for ads just not
true
data mining according to many is a 100
billion dollar business I happen to
think it's a great deal bigger than that
your data is voluntarily distributed to
firms all across the globe from various
research and advertising purposes many
of which you'll probably never know
about I know it seems like I've picked
on Google and especially Facebook in
this video there were more or less used
because of their sheer sizes and
capabilities but data is worthless
unless you can do something with it
they above all else have the resources
to do some crazy and scary things with
it if you'll just take one thing away
from this video nothing you do online is
private absolutely nothing doesn't
matter if you're tunneling through a VPN
or if you're an incognito mode someone
can always watch and someone can always
store that data unless you're I don't
know will I think will could probably
get around that if you liked this video
be sure to let me know by giving this
one a thumbs up I appreciate that thumbs
down a for the opposite or if you hate
everything about life I guess you can
thumbs down it for that too
be sure to click that red subscribe
button if you're feeling lucky and I'll
catch you in the next video this is
science to do thanks for being creeped
