see something online on the cheap i tend
to want to buy it just so i can show all
of you especially when it's selling for
much higher price and at some point you
can get it for a much cheaper price
right now that being the case for this
blue vivo air LTE now I'm sure you've
seen reviews of this phone on YouTube
already unbox therapy covered this phone
very well and so did Android Authority
but what I wanted to do is kind of just
give a a fresh take a fresh I guess
opinion if you will on this phone
because you can get this for much
cheaper than I believe either of those
channels purchased the phone for back
when it was first released I first use
this one for about a hundred and forty
bucks on Amazon brand new
it was also Amazon fulfilled so I got it
in two days so in essence this videos
gonna revolve around my first
impressions of holding one of the
world's thinnest LTE phones the blue
vivo air LTE like I said I purchase this
with my own money no one else has given
me this phone to review for any reason I
just have a very strong curiosity for
technology like this and so here we go
well if that's if that's a litter oh
there's no way this is the whole phone
are you kidding folks you see how I mean
I know you okay here's an s4 it's pretty
thin foam that is half as thick as the
s4 are you here I'm gonna just one
second
I cannot believe this phone is this thin
this does not feel like the whole phone
at all it feels like the batteries not
inserted you know when you get some
phones like this one I purchased it the
battery wasn't in the phone and the
phone feels super light here like all is
because the battery's not in there
that's not the case here this is a glass
back and glass front you can't remove
the battery it's built into the phone
it's in there somehow Mako would you
stop doing whatever you're doing down
there
Mako wants to check it out folks I don't
know if you know this but I have two two
dogs one of them is as this one Mako
he's smaller than misty who was in the
last video if you watched that one I'll
put it in the card right here this
little man
is a little more rambunctious and he
makes a lot more noise when I film it's
like he knows I'm filming and he just
decides to make bunch of noise when that
happens thank you I went outside with
little guy and filmed in 1080p with the
vivo era the phone packs an 8 megapixel
camera from Sony as well as 1080p 30fps
capabilities quality was actually better
than I expected contrast is spot-on it
does fairly well in low light and
shadows and takes decent stills decent
of course for a sub $150 phone the 5
megapixel front-facing camera is a nice
touch as well the processor in here is a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 quad core
running at 1.2 gigahertz with respect to
something like a galaxy s4 which you can
pick up used for about the same price
we're looking at roughly two-thirds of
the performance according to Geekbench
although keep in mind that both phones
come equipped with the same two
gigabytes of vram a nice feature of the
vivo air the UI is super smooth
essentially stock Android 5.0 point 2
out of the box I love the fluidity the
bare-bones interface actually makes it
run smoother than my s4 with its
troublesome TouchWiz UI you either love
it or hate it the 720p screen isn't 100%
crisp like the s4 s but it's a drawback
I'm willing to compromise on for the
sake of an ultra low price and super
thin frame all in all build quality is
on point the glass on both the front and
back as well as the aluminum bezel give
the vivo air a premium iPhone like
feeling in the hand it's about the same
size of the knife own 6 as well but
rather with a 4.8 inch screen instead of
a 4.7 inch one screen resolutions are
almost identical as well believe it or
not it just may not appear that way
because one is an IPS display and the
other is a Super AMOLED 2 super simplify
things the vive air has super saturated
colors and relatively infant
contrast because individual pixels can
turn themselves off all the way whereas
with an LCD panel your colors are gonna
look more natural and more realistic but
you won't get those true blacks that you
get with Super AMOLED displays because n
LCD cannot turn off individual pixels
nonetheless the people air does have an
impressive screen even when compared
side-by-side to the galaxy s4 which has
a much warmer Super AMOLED screen I've
noticed I do prefer the cooler tones of
the vivo air so the specifications are
of course out of date but for $140 foam
and for what current version of Android
this one is running 5.0 point 2 I don't
think you're gonna notice any severe lag
I haven't thus far I know you just saw
me unboxing it but it's been about three
or four hours since I ended that clip
and cut right to this one so I've been
playing around with the four while I
went outside filmed a lot took some
pictures very impressed with the phone
so far battery life seems to be okay
it's nothing stellar right now I have
about 58 minutes of screen on time and
currently my battery is at 36% that's
not too bad keep in mind this is a Super
AMOLED display only 720p not 1080p or
1440p but from a distance you can't see
anything if you're interested in about
screen resolutions and viewing distances
you can check out the video above me for
the most part you're not gonna notice
any pixels unless you get really really
close to it which that would just that
would just cause a headache in itself
right there but with that folks I
present to you the blue vivo air LTE is
it a yes for me yes folks it is I am
very impressed with this phone I might
actually switch my current carrier to
t-mobile just so that I can say that I'm
using one of the thinnest phones around
it's very snappy I haven't noticed any
lag yet the camera is great too the
screen is great for 140 bucks it's hard
to say no to that be sure to check them
out I have the link to this phone in the
video's description again no one's paid
me or sent me anything to do this review
in particular I purchased this phone
with my own money because I was just
curious about it and I'm glad I did
because that's I mean look even with the
case on its it's thinner than an iPhone
5s buy it so you never get margin that
is impressive in itself if you like what
you saw in this video you like the sheer
curiosity I have for products like these
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
give it a thumbs down if you little bit
off sonority everything about life
please subscribe but if you have already
stay tuned for for this thing of course
that I have teased about multiple times
I know bear with me folks
and also coming very very soon in fact
even sooner than this at gtx 1070 review
we're gonna be pitting that thing
head-to-head with this gtx 980ti behind
me which one is the better buy currently
I already said that's a good deal for
420 bucks let's find out if the 1070 is
all that it stacks up to be
this is science studio thanks for
learning with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
