MacBook this is the fourth installment
of the Apple experiment I've been very
satisfied with the portable devices thus
far but I haven't touched on issues that
many of you have with the MacBook in
particular in part one many of you
complain about my laptop choice it's
underpowered it's overpriced the list
goes on it's ok it's ok so that's what
this video will focus on negatives
involving the long term use of the 2016
MacBook and after almost 30 days of
rigorous use I have a pretty good idea
of what needs improvement remember I
paid for all of these devices out of my
own personal pocket so I'm not obligated
to say one thing or another these are
just my raw impressions of the Apple
ecosystem speaking of which here are the
things that I hate and that you may hate
too about the MacBook 2016
first up obviously the fact that it's
only sporting a single USB type-c port
and after countless complaints from
consumers in regards to the 2015 version
Apple did literally nothing to remedy
this issue they didn't really change
much at all about the 2016 version they
didn't even bother adding a second USB
type-c port my solution for now is this
a cheap type c2 HDMI USB 3.0 and type C
extension its goofy-looking on the
expensive side and is an all-around
inconvenience to carry around but hey at
least it's in the space gray color this
of course will depend on your daily
needs with the MacBook but I can say
with certainty that since I was unable
to connect a wireless mouse as is I'll
never ever take a USB port for granted
ever again
it's a feeling you'll only have with a
laptop as miniscule as this one not that
that's an excuse to only include one
type C port something else that
downright irritates me is the fact that
the glass on the screen extends to the
very edge of the frame and while it may
look more professional professional in a
long run it's a fingerprint magnet oils
are constantly showing up on these
bezels and it looks terrible in the
light this isn't a problem just the 2016
MacBook mind you but seeing is though
this is my first Apple computer it's
something I personally wish I could
change the MacBook Air is on the right
track in this regard thanks to its
silver bezels perhaps extending the
space great aluminum over to this side
that might work I just I just hate
seeing fingerprints here's one for you
the camera we're talking 480p and
obviously subpar audio so this is the
mic right now that I'm speaking into and
this is the laptops audio the laptops
just sitting in my lap where it's meant
to be this is what I would expect audio
and video quality to sound and look like
if I was speaking to somebody in a
conference call or something along those
lines so for 1,000 our laptop again it's
just disappointing another aesthetic
flaw in my opinion this ugly plastic bar
spending the south side of the panel
what the heck is this who came up with
this it's not like it's only this color
for the space gray version either it's
this way for the gold version the rose
gold version you get my point
and it just it stands out it's just ugly
why not keep things uniformed all around
the screen as seen on the MacBook Pro or
go the macbook air route and cover the
bezel entirely with the metallic silver
plating I don't know if this serves and
I
actual purpose or if it's just there to
look good because it doesn't maybe
somebody in the comments can help me out
there but needless to say I hope it's
phased out in the next generation now
let's talk performance yes I knew
exactly what I was getting myself into
when it came to ultra portable video
editing more on that right here but when
it came to even other simpler tasks I
found the laptop was lagging behind a
bit scrolling through this well log for
example results in some serious lag and
artifacting this is only a 76 megabyte
file by the way and seeing as though I
do quite a bit of this in my field I'm
disappointed by the performance here
seventy six megabytes stored in memory
shouldn't result in this kind of lag
optimizations to blame as well obviously
but PDF shouldn't be this choppy even on
a lower power dual-core processor with
hyper-threading something else I forgot
to mention earlier this Apple logo on
the front it's reflective not LED
backlit like it is on the air and pro I
think what's a super decision point
blank because now all Apple's done is
replaced a prominent and rather
appealing logo in my opinion with that
of a subdued one which is also get this
a fingerprint magnet again so let me get
this straight if I'm paying 1000 dollars
for an Apple laptop I should expect
compromises like these it's something I
would definitely change back to the
typical pro and err design and I hope
that the pro and err MacBooks both keep
this this design I think it looks I
think looks appealing and it sets these
Apple laptops apart from the rest
it just says hey I have a macbook boom
that's that's really it's all it does
but I think it looks nice lastly
something else I cannot go without
mentioning is the keyboard now I
understand that this laptop is super
thin I get it compromises had to be made
but Apple couldn't raise these keys just
a bit more I don't mind key protrusion
if it means greater travel distance and
responsiveness it really does feel as
though I'm typing on a screen at times
it isn't annoying at first but if you
plan on writing an extensive paper let's
say it'll quickly get old but I just I
can't make myself and this video on bad
terms there are cons clearly you're
making compromises going with such a
slim portable form factor that was one
of the main reasons why I purchased this
laptop but there are still many pros
that I think outweigh the cons mentioned
earlier the purpose of this video was to
elaborate on things that deter people
from purchasing the 2016 MacBook and I
feel as though Apple's MacBook sales
would increase
if these issues were resolved assuming
price stays the same by the way
something I didn't mention in the
previous videos if you want a laptop
that looks identical to this one and are
willing to make a few compromises for
the sake of saving about 200 US dollars
click on the link in this video's
description it's the 2015 MacBook same
storage similar compute performance only
major downside is the fact that it's
sporting a lower power integrated
graphics processor and a Broadwell CP
versus the sky like CPU but I don't
recommend this thing for really gaming
anyway simply put in my opinion saving
200 bucks justifies the 25% reduction in
graphics performance and it's not like
we're taking it away from a gaming
laptop or anything like that obviously
this was intended for a completely
different user I purchased this one from
Best Buy for 1,050 dollars thanks to the
student discount but if I could do it
all over again I'd purchase this one
right here if you like the insight this
video provided be sure to give this one
a thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
