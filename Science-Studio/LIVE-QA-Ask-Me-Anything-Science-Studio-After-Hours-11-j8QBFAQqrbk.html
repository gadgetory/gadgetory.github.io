are back at it for the 11th after-hours
livestream on the channel to probably a
bit more than that but this is the 11th
official one I guess I should say what
is going on with my hair what is what is
this anyway yeah if the stream needs to
be fixed if I am too loud if I am too
quiet I would like you to inform me of
that as soon as possible that would
definitely take the edge off of those
just now showing up and everyone wants
to point out that audio is an issue I
don't blame you so I'm gonna get that
out of the way as soon as possible and
let's see here I'm gonna pull the event
I'm gonna make sure that I can see your
chats as they roll in here here we go
okay sorry about any feedback you might
have just heard there what's going on
everyone this is just another kind of
sketchy livestream setup here I like to
keep things simple i I tried at one
point using a capture card and an
official you know I have an extra
mirrorless camera camera that I used at
first to get the picture nice and crispy
but I just don't think that that's
really what the I don't know I think you
guys come here to have your questions
answered I don't think you come here for
the sexy primary role or the a role
whatever you wanna call it so this is
more or less just me kind of being down
to earth you know just getting dirty
with you guys and some simple stuff
simple and personal and that's kind of
the point of livestream it says after
hours number 10 probably should have
changed that let me go ahead and change
that right now at 11 that's much better
okay and to go back to the view page
that's what I'm talking about
alright sorry about that weird title it
okay my dudes and dudettes
I'm sure primarily dudes this guy here
Adam says I'm rockin 1440p at 120 Hertz
no problem with a 1060 that's impressive
won't even game settings are though and
what CPU you have that paired with ducks
ups B hello new to the channel can you
submit craigslist ads and if so where
you can do so ducks you can do that on
twitter if you'd like
you can do it via our Facebook page and
it's facebook.com forward slash science
to do whitey Twitter comm forward slash
science to do whitey I don't recommend
trying to personally contact me via
Instagram cuz I don't use it for
anything other than posting photos
obviously so I would stick to Twitter
and Facebook I don't recommend you email
me because a lot of those get filtered
out anyway if you send it and it doesn't
look like a business inquiries to
matically throws it to either the spam
or a separate folder that we've set up
for things that aren't business
inquiries that we still typically go to
but every now and then I forget to look
through it so if you have something like
that you'd like to submit you can do it
on Twitch you can follow me down below
the links are in the video description
and yeah again Facebook and Twitter are
the best ways to do that Victor is 22
think of it that $10 New Zealand
whatever that equates to in the u.s.
doesn't matter I appreciate your super
chat there hey Greg guy has a stated two
days ago car written off out II have got
a call from insurance today it is a
write-off found a 2012 Audi s6 that I
will be buying tonight with the
twin-turbo v8 my dude alright so I've
done some serious research in the end of
the s6 is because I love those engines
the 4.0 twin turbos though there's some
killer killer specs I know it's not like
I'm talking about computers right now
but I I love the sound of it I've I've
yet to drive one now my dad has a 5.2 r8
I'm pretty sure what there's a simple
ECU flash the s6 is faster than that v10
so I the only thing I wish that the s6
was was a coupe I don't like the fact
that it's a sedan it's a classy sedan
I'll give it that but at the same time
you know once you drive a coupe and you
know people look at coupes and I okay
they're a little sportier than the
sedans and Sudan's you know it's it's a
sleeper basically it's what the s6 is it
doesn't look necessarily like a super
fast car as fast as it is anyway despite
the you know having the quad tailpipe so
that's the only reason why I haven't
actually given it some serious thought
and to buying one although I have done
my research into the car in particular
because it looks mean if you buy it
ECU flash the thing go with APR somebody
reputable and I think you're gonna love
it Asus drove it yesterday it is fast oh
yeah
and I want to say just for the record
you guys I don't know if you if you know
I Drive it an Audi s5 and my s5 is a 4.2
liter v8 it's just a naturally aspirated
v8 it's very similar to the one found in
the rs4 but the rs4 from around that era
actually earlier than my year that car
is the engines better in the rs4 because
it it it just revs higher it's got
higher its own well horse pride pretty
sure it's got like 420 horsepower might
get about 354 and that's you know
factory so it's probably less than that
now but those things have you know all
the the nice features you want in an
older v8 right it still sounds really
good that's really high insane revs and
again rs4 it's a sedan so that's the
only reason why I never gave that one
serious not either but these v8 SAR
they're just tanks I mean mine's been
driving just fine the older v8s and the
older v6 is you know all these engines
have the timing chains at the back
against the firewall so if anything any
of those little plastic guide snaps
right or just wears down then that's
gonna be an engine out process right you
take the engine and the transmission out
then you got to pull the transmit
transmission off the block and then you
got to pull the covers off the back of
the block to get to those chains alright
more specifically the the grooves the
guides that keep the chains in place of
course when those guides break you just
got out just a serious miss timing issue
your cylinders won't open when they
should close when they should that's a
big no-no for your engine so yeah that's
one of the reasons why you know I'll add
people when I first bought the car were
like oh it's not a good idea right it's
an Audi not sure if you should do that
but mine's been mine's been great up to
now knocking on wood but uh it you know
I I really enjoyed driving it with the
exhaust kit it's just a beast I get
people all the time looking at night
tell them they do it's like a twenty
thousand dollar car you know it's it's
it's cheaper than a Camaro or a Mustang
of the same caliber right but people are
really blown away by how cheap the car
is and that's something I kind of take
pride in like yeah I found this little
gem here I think it's a really good
price if it breaks it's gonna suck yeah
for sure I'm kind of gambling on that
there but it's a
for a driver really is mark Weaver's
think for that five that pounds that is
5 pounds why do you call the PCIe power
cables from the PSU to graphics card VGA
cables I just call them VGA cables
because that you traditionally right you
have VGA ports a VGA card just a video
card so when I say VGA cables you
usually what I say is supplemental VGA
power connectors like I said in the last
video that's that's my official quote
not what you said there VGA cables
that's kind of vague but it's
supplemental power right so yeah up to
75 Watts
on paper coming through the PCI slot and
then if you need supplemental power I
just call it supplemental VGA power
because it used to be a VGA card they're
not anymore and I don't know anybody
uses VGA unless you're using a card
that's extremely old or using a
converter because new cards don't even
support VGA ok scrolling down I'm gonna
get to mega T again I see the donation
there alright so they call me X I have a
question what air cooler would you
recommend I go R to go with an i7 4770k
because my stock cooler mounts are
cracking using a stock cool over that
4770k I would say my dude it depends you
know it firfer has well i7 you could
probably get by with a cryo Riggle h7
cryo rig see one if you want to go with
the quiet be quiet dark rock pro 3 or 4
or a top flow if you wanted with cooler
master hyper 212 Evo is still plenty
it's kind of the benchmark right now has
been for the longest time and for good
reason it's very cheap as well those are
the three or four models that I would
recommend you check out for that there
scrolling down here I see you guys
Prince of Dzung says longest paper ever
written words only no diagrams or
pictures included ok so I had a paper
actually it's my first year this wasn't
even an engineering school this was my
first year Business School so this was
back when I was like 19 I wrote a really
killer paper on I think it was I'm
pretty sure it was it was on Black
Friday a traditional Black Friday this
was economics class so it was the run on
the gold on the on the markets right
with people who were basically is just
arbitrage right you were
exchanging gold and silver and other
precious metals between countries where
it was often cheaper to do so and then
they would make money simply by trading
you know the currency in foreign markets
that was basically what the essence of
the paper was on was why the stock
market crashed back then was because
people were they were over speculating
and they were being very very vicious
with their buying and selling habits
arbitrage is a word that actually I've
just now started using ever since I took
one of my recent finance classes for my
MBA and it's actually something that
technically doesn't exist in a perfect
market but every now and then you have a
small window of opportunity where it
would be cheaper to invest in a foreign
market or sell it in a foreign market
versus here you can also do that with
interest rates right so if you want to
think about like interest rates being
cheaper there or you want to buy a bond
there and sell it here
that's all arbitrage and usually it's
only very temporary because the markets
self-corrects and when people catch on
to that they tend to exit okay
Viktor us again my dude you can just
come I'm you're a patreon supporter you
can just comment in the discord I
haven't pulled up actually it's
minimized now but I'm gonna pull it up
again so if anybody watching the stream
is on discord I have it up now if you
would like to ask your questions there
you guys are already you're already
supporting the channel financially you
don't need a super chat to get the to
get your questions answered and I'm
sorry it has to be like this for
everyone else watching I just there's a
lot of questions I'm trying to get
through as many as I can I don't want to
feel like I'm leaving out the people who
are going above and beyond to support us
financially
when did cars beyond $5,000 become cheap
I say cheap because it's it's a relative
word right cheap cheap is subjective
anyway but you can use cheap and an
accurate sense by relating one product
to another from a price perspective you
have two houses that are 3,000 square
feet apiece they have the same you know
amenities everything else same size plot
of land and one of them is 250 and other
one's 450 the one that's 250 is cheap
250 K is not a cheap price right that's
a lot of money people usually can't pay
in cash that's why you finance but it's
cheap relatively speaking so that's all
don't break my balls over my use of
cheap but that's why I use it
but Mr Chris's is are you a gatekeeper
okay I am gonna swirl up one more time
here don't want to miss can he be what's
going on Kenny do you think for that $5
super chat which motherboard brand do
you ever do you prefer MSI asu's
gigabyte etc look honestly I think I
unless a board is clearly a better
overclocker which is usually you know
the top tiers III 70 X 470 boards are
gonna all kind of overclock about the
same unless there's a serious
manufacturing flaw with the board or a
model I think that ASIS boards probably
look the best I think MSI has a niche
because MSI's one of the few
manufacturers it still has white PCB
boards which is a really cool thing
I think gigabyte boards are great values
I haven't used an as rocket bore in a
long time because they keep switching
people and I hate dealing with new
people because and they're like oh well
who are you okay we want this this and
this know how we don't we want you to
give us a full dedicated video on the
motherboard now instead of just
featuring it in a build video and like
you know motherboard reviews are already
difficult enough but then when you want
a review for every single motherboard
you're gonna send me sorry I'll go on to
somebody else who is not gonna be as
stringent on that so do I have one flat
rock in a while but gigabyte MSI and
Asus all have their advantages and you
can usually find one or two of them
cheaper than the others and that's
usually the one I go for I'm not brand
loyal in any way okay yeah rusty
Shackelford Greg I couldn't find the
video about it but with regards to die
scaling are we ever going to have a
chance to use graph to use graphene as
the next big advancement silicon I read
a little bit about this I haven't done a
dedicated video in graphene's that's
probably why I haven't seen it on the
channel but graphene like carbon to go
back and remember what I'm trying to
talk about here but when I was talking
about in one of my you know how small
can we get right with the transistor the
FinFET and whatnot I was talking about
how we have the effect of quantum
tunneling right past a certain point
because the threshold is so small the
the gap is so narrow that electrons
basically tunnel when they're not
supposed to so the electron is our that
the transistor is technically open all
the time which makes it not a transistor
so that's one of the big challenges
we're we imagine we would have around
five nanometers but we always find ways
to improve it right I mean
I think IBM has like a four or five
nanometer CP like a fully-functioning CP
of course it's it's you know on on the
DL and since it's not gonna be a
consumer rate ship anytime soon but we
found ways around it so that's that's
one of the things that I talked about in
that video but I didn't touch on other
technologies to get around that so I'm
looking at myself right now and I'm
doing some weird things with my hands I
apologize but yeah that's an interesting
topic really is Aaron lit Leopard left
fold Leopold
that's probably what it is sorry Aaron
Leopold says I noticed in one of your
videos you were using a vo-tech curved
monitor and was wondering what your
opinion was on it I have a dedicated
video on an errand type in via Tech
curved monitor science studio go ahead
check out that vent that review video it
will answer your questions I imagine
okay all right cute cute peel your
y'all's names Jesus what would you pick
I 580 400 or Rison 520 600 X I'm only
using it for gaming and my testing the
i5 8400 is still somehow manages an edge
in most games it's not a substantial
edge I would say if you expect to only
game ever then maybe the i-5 is a thing
it's gonna be really tough to recommend
the i-5 though in general over the r5
2600 X which is a great all-around CPU
for the price so I have to stick to my
guns though strictly gaming the i-5 is
better so objectively I would go with
the i-5 strictly for gaming Derek Cooke
says what's it like being human let me
tell you my friend it is an adventure
and it's sometimes a stressful adventure
sometimes it's a very fun adventure but
it's an adventure nonetheless and I make
the most of it I hope that you all do as
well okay someone asked if I speak
Spanish right into the name
okay that's ren claun do you speak
Spanish I assume it I should be able to
unfortunately I am NOT I'm not fluent in
Spanish so I kind of him like one of
those like quasi cuz I'm a Hispanic
right I'm 50% Spanish so technically
like I'm my you know official documents
I'm Hispanic
despite being of the white race it's
kind of weird how like when you go to
fill out your ethnicity and your race
there's all the different races right
there's white black
you know asia-pacific you name it any of
those races is on there and then you
have a separate category just for
ethnicity and then it will say are you
Hispanic / Latino and it just I guess
that's just something that goes on in
the states I don't know if anyone in
Europe asks that question if they you
know separate ethnicity from race but
it's the only ethnicity they ever put on
forms is a Hispanic Latino like it's the
only one that matters or something
so I proudly slap that thing on there
just because I'm gonna milk my 50% but
it's not something I've really like
grown up with I never grew up speaking
Spanish in the home so that's kind of
why I never learned I took it in high
school but I'd say at this point I
probably speak almost as much a German
as I do Spanish and I've been trying to
teach myself German because of Lisa and
her family on to be able to talk to her
family personally without Lisa having to
translate everything I want to say to
her mom and dad so hopefully I'll be
more fluent in German soon than I am in
Spanish of a model right I see another
one here scroll and scroll and trollin
okay
bazinga exes think of that $5.00 super
chat my dude could 1 d5 pumphandle 4 for
a tier adds a motherboard CPU block and
two GPUs od5 pumps are super powerful
dude like that I could have met and I
know you see a lot of like when you have
overkill custom loops like that you'll
see people using two reservoirs usually
that's just because they either want to
fill up the extra space or they want to
run two different colors of coolant you
know to give it just a bit of a WOW
factor on top of what you would already
have with a custom loop you know when
you turn a d5 pump up to its max rpm
I think chugs and one of my pumps in
actually the the winter build
winterville version - that pump is
locked to max speed and it's annoying
because it's loud but it pushes fluid so
I would I would probably go out and say
that it's okay I would build a system
with just one d5 pump assuming that
would be fine going through those rads
is gonna be pretty tough because right
those led those Reds have tiny little
channels and the fluid has to push
through and that builds up you know
resistance fluid pressure but I think
the defy pump can handle I would google
it just look at other people who have
tried to do it I'm sure that the people
out there just a double check do your
due diligence because I
I haven't actually personally tested
that but in my experience I would say
it's probably enough somebody else would
probably know the answer to that better
than I would though uh eh Schroedinger
me Hank Greg can you play minesweeper on
stream do we even have minesweeper on
Windows 10 I don't think we do oh no
wait we do no no we don't have
minesweeper that's a disappointing you
know when he used to be a thing like it
came standard that was something I
looked forward to so much with XP but uh
well there's pop and NIM pop with that
dollar 99 cent donation again saying
benchmark on ABC Mouse please which you
look up ABC Mouse if you haven't already
it's one of those kiddie games which I
imagine would run 5000 FPS on a system
like this but uh I don't know where he
gets it kicks I appreciate the donation
I probably won't ever officially
benchmark with something as rudimentary
as ABC Mouse
I'm sorry hate to disappoint pop named
Bob Elijah Stricker hey Greg I'm putting
my build in an s3 40 elite good choice
my friend do you think I should replace
the stock fans or should hold on to them
for intake buying to 128 ye or RGB fans
okay so the bay I think the s340 elite
I'm trying to remember what came in out
of the box I'm pretty sure there's one
fan at the rear and I think there's one
more fan up front I think they're both
120mm fans so what you could do if you
wanted Elijah is I would put the two
120mm fans at the front right because if
you're gonna have those intake then the
eight you are RGB rings are going to be
on the outside so it would do you no
good to put those at the front so I
would let the two stock fans that are
include with yesterday for you they're
not too bad I would let those intake and
then I put 180 or a fan up top and then
one a your fan at the rear to exhaust so
you have to exhaust to intake and both
of those RGB rings on those fans will
shine into the case which is ultimately
what you're going for so I would keep
those two other fans you know it
wouldn't hurt anyway just in case in the
future and let those be the intake fans
because you're not going to see the
color the colors of the AR fans if you
put those up front and have them
because they're only one-sided Aer fans
geared Inc what's going on dude watched
your channel for years and just hit 10k
on my channel thanks for all you do and
being so thorough in your views any
advice is welcome thanks my dude I have
a couple videos that would help you out
for sure I hope anyway I try to upload
at least one or two videos every month
or so you know tie it into what I do as
a youtuber the kind of decisions that I
made to get to where I am the challenges
that I currently face right so I would
say I have a couple videos about like
the the gear that I use how I receive
samples from companies how long it took
to do all that how I manage all those
how I manage sponsorships and ads and
whatnot those videos would be really
helpful for you I think so give those
give those a watch if you haven't
already and I'll be sure to keep
uploading this and stay tuned but thank
you for your super chat I appreciate it
scrolling down Kaden P when do new GPUs
come out no idea but I imagine is gonna
be sometime within the next month or so
from Nvidia anyway NVIDIA tends to
release their new architecture or debut
their new architecture around Computex
so Computex is early June that's just
the heads-up probably gonna be sometime
around then I don't have personal
connections with Nvidia so I don't know
for sure
Ford's what's up when are you going to
do a Doug de Miro style PC review
honestly the guy's got it he's got a
really good thing going for him I would
be I would I would actually love to do a
parody that's actually a really good
idea I have to write that one down
I would I would really like to imitate
and talk to her and review PC and said I
love Doug I love his car reviews the guy
you know he knows cars he's reviewed
enough of them to know exactly what he
you know what you should look for in a
car reliability he writes a lot of vlogs
blogs with ABI and yeah I mean I would
say in a way he's he's kind of like one
of my role models because he he just got
so big so fast and there's so much to
learn from a channel that does something
like that it's very difficult to do
especially now on YouTube and he set
himself apart by his you know quirky
personality and but he still manages to
get the point across right the things
that people want to know about the car
so maybe I could do something like that
with PCs not sure
work but worth a shot okay Tyler yeah
yeah Kirino do you still use the MacBook
yes I do sitting in the room right now
charging bill Edwards asked by
supercharged the test five yet the
answer is no because I want to blow my
transmission and I'm pretty sure the
minitor gonna be getting from that
engine with the supercharger on top of
it with a stock electronic transmission
it's not gonna be it's gonna be too much
I imagine or if anything the
transmission would be able to handle it
right they have out er rates for using
the same transmission but that much
torque that's the thing right so you
have the let's just put it this way the
are tronic transmission right was used
up until 2012 I believe in most Audi
models the Audi r8 let's say which is
probably one of the fastest cars using
the electronic transmission up to that
date had a 4.2 liter v8 that pushed
around 450 horsepower but the torque the
torque on the r8 is actually a lot lower
than the horsepower and so what you want
to really look for when you're worrying
about whether your transmission can
handle the amount of power that your
engine is producing is actually not
focusing on the horsepower itself which
is more upper end stuff that's like you
know high rpm the torque is the low-end
stuff that's the stuff that puts you
back into your seat and that will
definitely chew through transmissions
quicker than any you know high
horsepower car will so I'm just worried
about the longevity of the transmission
if I did something like that on top of
that it's freaking expensive so maybe at
some point I'll do something crazy like
that to a new car but I won't do it to
the s5 I I don't I don't want to make
things you know I don't want to miss
things up okay your thoughts on the ZTE
seven year ban I don't know anything
about that I'm gonna have to uh I don't
have to look through that that's
interesting maybe a dedicated video and
then I'll do some research and we'll see
what went on Samuel Messersmith any
recommendations for water cooling my
1070 fe in an ITX case I can fit one 120
mil rad you're gonna have to buy
probably again that 120 ml rad and then
get yourself a really small slim
reservoir with an integrated pump it
might have to be a DDC pump because
little smaller than g5s and you have
that mounted directly to the radiator so
it just sits right there and then you
can have your hardline tubes drop
straight down right into into the
graphics card so that could be a way
that you could do it it'd be a really
small loop not sure if you want to do it
that way but that's probably all you
could do unless you wanted to add more
rads or just make your bends go
everywhere for no reason we have a new
sponsor on the channel thank you mr. KF
and gaming with a capital G I appreciate
that you guys if you are unfamiliar what
a sponsor is it's essentially what a
subscriber is on Twitch now what a
subscribers on YouTube YouTube's been
using the subscription button for a
totally different purpose for several
years I have a video actually coming out
on this to talk about what the sponsored
button specifically does to come out I
think early this week so stay tuned if
you if you want to know more about it
but in general what you do if you become
a sponsor similar house which works that
except which takes like a 50% Commission
unless you're a really you know hotshot
and then I think they take 40% but if
you sponsor then you pay $4.99 a month
it's not you know you can renew it if
you want but it's not like I set in
something for a year it's just per month
if you want to handle it that way
$4.99 and then what you get from that is
you get added perks in the chats so I'm
pretty sure what you'll see see truck or
bond became a sponsor
thank you trucker bomb even though
you're already a patreon supporter
telling you to do both but that's that
is really cool I appreciate it
the the creators from this from youtube
sponsors get a 70% cut so we get about
tree fiddy from that $4.99 which is I
love that it's tree fiddy I don't like
the fact that the YouTube still scrapes
30% but it is a less it is a you know a
smaller cut than what twitch takes
so that's YouTube's way it kind of nudge
and twitch everything I we did you one
better
but twitch is still dominating the
live-streaming space so yeah be
interesting to see how that plays out so
if you guys are if you are a subscriber
or a sponsor excuse me I'm getting so
confused if you're a sponsor which is
again different than a Youtube
subscriber then comment in the chat box
because you're gonna have a special
little badge you should have a special
badge and we can change these badges if
you guys vote on them later and we get
more people around
yeah check that out all right so you see
mr. KF gaming here I know it's gonna be
a little delayed scroll up just a little
bit you'll see mr. KF gaming and he's
got this little uh he's got this little
battery next to his name
trucker bomb has it - he's just below
mr. K Afghani so that battery there is
it's basically like you know picture an
iPhone battery or any kind of smartphone
animated battery and if you renew your
sponsorship or your yeah if you renew
your sponsorship after one month so if
you're a two-time sponsor then your
battery level increases so it turns
yellow and it gets a little higher and
then if you're a three month or a four
month you know it keeps going up I think
it maxes out at like six months but then
it's a fully charged green battery so
there's like four or five bars there I
just I thought it was something a little
unique you know but it sets you guys
apart in the chat so uh yeah a dead
battery I know that's that's not what I
you guys at least have a battery your
powered that's what I want you to think
about it if it if it's not catching on
we can change it but I just thought it
would look cool especially when you have
like you know give it a chance right
because two or three months from now you
might have a lot of people who are still
on the red battery but you guys are
gonna have if you keep sponsoring you're
gonna have like the yellow or the green
battery so you're gonna be the senior's
right I just think it's gonna be uh
something interesting to just just kind
of see play out in the future anyway
yeah so a quick shot Gaming says gaming
channels fed sponsorships for a while
and that makes sense right because
gaming channels typically livestream and
you you get an added benefit in live
streams when you sponsor because you
again get that icon always showing up
next to your name I'm pretty sure it
also translates over to comment sections
as well I will have to see but I'm
pretty sure that's that's how it works
it's so cool seeing chucker bomb with
the and you know it's so cool seeing you
guys with with the icon just like
actually in real life anyway we have
like 15 percent battery everyone else
needs a battery replacement oh yeah look
at it like that that's that that's a
good way to look at it oh gosh but I
appreciate you guys I really appreciate
the sponsorships that's really cool and
and trucker bomb I don't know if mr. KF
gaming is a patreon supporter but if
you're gonna sponsor me I don't
recommend you support us on patreon
either unless you want that tier 3 perks
because you're basically paying the same
amount for access to the private discord
and whatnot so you don't have to do that
but I appreciate it nonetheless okay uh
that's what I'm looking at here pop him
pop keeps asking about the ABC Mouse I
do not play ABC now full battery the
cell won't hold a full charge anymore
Jax for Jax
fan Rick I was watching a live stream of
mark Dice the other day and he had to
get over 2k from donations they was
coming in like crazy that's insane I
mean yeah there are streamers out there
you guys know the big big hotshots
especially on Twitch they're making Bank
every single time they click the go-live
button they're just rolling in the dough
so you know good on them right they've
built empires basically David hunter I
see you thank you for stopping by
appreciate says love your channel scroll
on down here up he at quick shots says
he doesn't notice the comments being
different but I only have a couple yeah
same I mean we just started to so well
to see but trucker bomb mr. KF gaming if
you guys don't mind
once this thing post if you're still
awake comment in the comment section so
we can test it out so we can see if your
badges also show up in the description
or in the comment section also I haven't
made emojis yet but you guys would
normally have access to emojis and there
gonna be a course they're gonna try to
be unique right for science to do so if
you want to suggest a feature set of
emojis or you want to make your own for
the channel I invite you to do that you
can contact us directly on discord now
that you guys are our sponsors and
cajoled access privately so it would be
cool to see what you guys recommend beta
on discord beta 2017 asks why haven't
you been on snapchat lately good
question I definitely should be pushing
that a lot more and I'm guilty of a beta
I really am because that's something I
put that's like one of the things like
you get to add me as a you know I add me
privately on snapchat I just haven't
gotten around using it a lot because I
haven't just used snapchat personally in
a long time I figured that this would be
an excuse when you get back into it I
got to do it though you guys are
supporting financially I gotta I gotta
keep my word and these monthly live
streams that we're gonna do that will be
private for the guys who are willing to
donate and support us financially are
going to be starting up this month as
well so more
details in the discord server if you
guys want to check that out all right I
need more questions more questions more
questions please
hmm all right I see someone the channel
name Jacob did not change I mean this is
the original channel name so it was
Salazar studio for a brief period of
time and that changed it back to what it
should be okay cool so trucker bomb
confirmed that if you are a sponsor you
also get that icon in the comments
section which is super cool so that's
like a permanent sticky right people are
gonna get to see that mmm someone said a
roast got flipped and toasted I don't
know that was taken out of context or
what bland Paloma hey Greg love the
channel tons of info in comparison
especially with air coolers I appreciate
that bland I actually have a dedicated
rig I told you guys this in one of those
videos specifically for air cool air
cooled and AIO
testing so that all that you know I'm
I'm sure the other channels do this as
well I would hope that they would I know
that gamers Nexus and fielder's try to
keep everything as consistent as
possible which is good to see but you
you want to keep all of your variables
right in check you don't want to change
variables from test a test because then
your benchmarks aren't going to
correlate directly and there's always
gonna be some variable you can't control
ultimately room temperature maybe
something along those lines but using
the exact same rig the same case right
because a lot of these are like open
test benches and testing and air cooler
on open test bench is not an official
test because no one's gonna run their PC
on an open test bench so I try to keep
things as like traditional and as
applicable as possible for you guys so
you can relate to it okay okay
scrolling back up here I missed quite a
number of questions juvy n-- Hoving
tower how you prepare for final exams I
actually tend to cry I tend to cram I
don't to say a data dump I retain quite
a bit but I don't think that I retain as
much as I probably should I got to go
back and read a lot especially after
months of not touching the topic
but I usually focus on studying for an
exam two days before and I devote two
solid days just to studying so my brain
is only thinking about the exam and then
when I finally take the exam my brain is
still wired to thinking that way so it's
easier for me to recall that's how I do
it so I see here not happy that's his
name he says at science studio my resin
2,400 G gets green screens all the time
any ideas not happy I would check your I
can see why you named yourself not happy
I wouldn't be happy either
check hardware monitor or hardware info
check your CPU temps make sure that
those are in check if you manually
overclocked at all revert everything
back to stock also check your RAM you
might be having some issues with RAM
frequency being that that's tied
directly to the Infinity fabric and you
might just have something some kind of
issue with software right with drivers
conflicting with something inside the
CPU may be like those Vega cores so
there's a lot that I would just
troubleshoot right away both software
and hardware but clear CMOS you know you
stock BIOS settings don't even overclock
your RAM or clock it whatever the box
frequency is keep it all stock see if it
still happens if it does then try
uninstalling that driver that video
driver and installing an older one you
can find this archived on many websites
make sure it's not you know packed with
a virus or something
so that's that's what I would do in that
situation
Mahe 22 advice on what to look for when
buying a wireless Wi-Fi adapter card for
the motherboard I can't find very much
about it and I'm building a PC at the
end of the month thanks look you can
spend hundreds of dollars on super high
tech Wi-Fi cards ultimately you're gonna
be limited more or less by your your
bandwidth from your router I use really
cheap like twenty five dollar Wi-Fi
cards and these are pcie-based Wi-Fi
cards right
so those plug in underneath my graphics
card two little antennas stick up
basically plug and play with Windows 10
and I get basically my full bandwidth
actually sometimes I get more than that
from a wireless connection as long as
I'm in the same room or maybe one room
over I get 500 down 50 up with my
plan and I'll get at least 500 up you
know because it's not actually an
official cap they don't actually cut you
off right at 500 sometimes a little
higher or lower sometimes a lot lower
depending on what's going on with the
the ISP okay I'm scrolling down here
Aaron Lee Leopold asked what the discord
channel is the discord channel is as of
right now it's reserved for just patreon
donors and sponsors on YouTube I have
often debated opening the discord
publicly but then it would defeat it
would defeat the purpose for me because
I feel like a lot of people would try to
ask me questions that I would never get
to in the discord but this way and it
sounds kind of I don't know take it take
it for what you will but I'm gonna just
say it straight up if it's pay-to-play
it minimizes the pool lot so I can focus
one-on-one with people who are willing
to financially support us and you know
then they actually feel like they're
getting something for it it helps the
channel because we do have sometimes we
have terrible months we don't make a lot
of money all on videos depending on how
YouTube prioritizes videos whose ranking
above us look up next - tech tips
there's another recommended video Linus
I'm pretty sure Linus is like targeting
our videos you can rank by the way just
by inserting links unto websites that
nobody goes to Google still sees and
their algorithm that you've linked your
video or that your video is linked on
ton of websites that are basically on
the DL and will rank your video higher
accordingly because it seems super
popular on paper right and I'm not sure
what ranking is but you know we don't do
anything super active like that on most
videos really we've tried it in like two
or three videos and it's only worked
probably at once so you can I mean you
know it depends on how the month is
going but this is a separate option here
for people if they want to support us
this way it just keeps things a little
spread apart yeah patreon only a it I
mean it sounds like I'm just all about
money and I don't want it to seem like
that even though the money definitely
helps big time
on some of those months but it you know
it lets people who do pay feel like
they're getting a little something extra
okay Samuel Oh Tavares can you use a CPU
up 12 volt for a case fan okay and if so
would still work with PWM and that
connector it depends on the motherboard
I use CPU optional fan ports and hubs
whatever you wanna call them all the
time and yeah for the most part you can
scale accordingly usually their PWM
supported sometimes they won't be I
would say in a few cases with modern
boards they won't be but most modern
boards especially on the higher end
chipsets are gonna have full-on pwm
support on any four pin fan hub and most
of those boards anyway should only have
four pin fan connectors because peter
games a lot better than DC so yep
there's that one okay Flyer srr did not
get email notification when you went
live that is YouTube in a nutshell for
you and I'm pretty sure it's hid and
it's pretty hard right now because we
only have about a hundred and seventy
people watching and again this is gonna
sound really bad again but I just
objectively we usually average around
300 or so people in the live stream so
we're running a little over half that
right now something's going on I would
say it sounds weird blaming YouTube but
I really think they have a big role in
this so sorry about that but I am very
happy that you stopped by anyway Darren
Healy what job would you pursue if you
or not doing YouTube I have an
engineering degree and I have I'm gonna
have my masters in business in October
so well I'll be finished with the
program out so I'll graduate in December
but that basically kind of sets me up
for really anything I I just I don't
want to be limited by a degree and I
feel like having an engineering degree
and a master's in business is kind of
like that that good combo right so I can
go work at a grocery store as a manager
you know like I don't do anything with
engineering per se because I have the
financial business background to or I
could just work full-on in the
engineering industry and make a little
more money because I have that master's
degree so it's versatile I don't have
anything in mind particularly that I
would like to do but as long as it paid
well and as long as it came with good
benefits I would strongly consider it if
YouTube was just not cutting it anymore
okay tech Bowl what cooler would you
recommend for a beginner PC with an i3
or an AI
five hyper 212 Evo cry rig h7 something
like that
Alexander Padilla hey Greg what's going
on Alex scrolling - I see you guys
replying to each other it's very cool
y'all are helping each other out Jason
as a veto he says I have an IQ of 130
but I suck at math here's a word about
IQ test I took an IQ test when I was I
was in third grade I think it was third
grade and apparently you take one IQ
test and that's like it's supposed to
speak for your entire life which I find
hard to believe because your brains
still developing in third by the third
grade but anyway I took one then my IQ
was like 136
I think I'm not saying that to trump you
I was just what they told me it was and
that that doesn't really I don't think
say much at all about your intelligence
it's more or less about analyzing and
identifying patterns like half the test
was patterns and it I mean what you know
identifying patterns is good in all it's
great for troubleshooting let's say but
like it doesn't tell you anything about
your ability to learn a new topic so
there there are several factors that you
know qualify as intelligence limiters or
enable errs and I don't think that
pattern recognition is like you know on
the top of my list let's say TNT thief
asks how old I am I am 23 think for that
all caps question Xun sunrise at science
studio got the air 7:40 at the three
stock fans and five course raf1 20s any
140mm fans you can recommend for the
case lighting not necessary I really
love silent wings three fans it's pretty
much my go-to fan for anything silent
especially when I'm not worried about
LEDs they look pretty good too right
they're all black they're they're nice
and sleek but expensive but they're one
of the there's some of the quietest fans
out there and you know there's often a
lot of debate between which ones are
actually quieter Noctua fans or silent
wings three fans not to a fans typically
have a higher pitch sound which is a
little harder to hear which makes them a
little quieter most of the time sign
that makes three fans are usually a
little deeper sounding so they sound
like a seer and that makes them a little
more detectable by the human ear in most
cases at least for me
but there so I mean the differences are
almost negligible so T and T thing says
I look 21 that's like two years from 23
so I I look my age I guess that's what
you mean
Palestine Jenkins perhaps a little
better it's still a mystery I don't I
think I read that out of context I'm
sure I'd wait cool khari asked hey does
sed ki work all over the world are only
a few countries I'm not sure you'll have
to check I mean the website will tell
you but that is something you can ask
their customer support and they should
get back to you pretty quick their
customer sports usually pretty quick at
responding mahi oh I skipped it mahi 22
again I have one more question what is a
few places you would recommend looking
at to buy parts for building a PC other
than Amazon new eggs a great place if
you're willing to buy used I use eBay I
use Craigslist
I almost said in cix don't do that I
almost said it the I was thinking I was
like wait hold on I'm trying to think
there are a couple other places at what
you can do is go to PC port picker and
just look at the retailers they list on
their site and usually those are gonna
be pretty reputable you could you could
go with like jet comm I've had friends
buy stuff from jet comm or jet whatever
jet I forget what it's called but jet
something and there are sites like that
that you know as long as you read
testimonials people seem to be pretty
straightforward with those things it's
not gonna be difficult okay
scrolling down again yeah I see guys do
you have any thoughts on the AMD Navi
rumors no I don't because I don't
usually read it rumors I just I don't
like reading information that is not
verified because then it might not be
verified in the future because then it
might be proven you know wrong in the
future then I got to redo all my
research again I just bother with it
Aditya VATS keeps asking about the Dell
g7 not even what that is dude I have no
idea what the Dell of g7 is I suck at
games after receiving your masters are
you going to prioritize a work force job
or continue YouTube here's my biggest
conflict right because YouTube on its
good months YouTube's enough its
and it's enough to have an OK living I
don't make a lot of money especially
after taxes I really don't you guys and
so this is more or less something I do
because I enjoy it it's enough to get me
to get me by and right now with the way
YouTube is prioritizing channels and
recommended and all that stuff it's
difficult to even grow right now so the
outlook on YouTube is just pretty
stagnant right now I'm I'm content with
where I'm at but at the same time I'm
not because I want to keep growing and
with the job it's kind of the same way
right with a with a job in the field
you're gonna have a salary cap you'll
have a ceiling that you're gonna hit
inevitably but with the job you also get
benefits you get perks you get
retirement you get things that you don't
get with YouTube unless you go outside
of the YouTube realm right to private
companies or the government and try to
source these things out so there are
perks to working with a company and I've
given that serious thought I don't know
exactly what I'm gonna do yet but my my
options are open and that was the goal
that was why I wanted degrees because
that kept my my doors open don't put all
your eggs in one basket just just don't
okay scrolling down some more I see you
guys okay the random come in come in
tour comment or asks if AMD never
released their eyes and CPUs with the
Intel Copy League CPUs have four cores
instead of six interesting we'd have to
look far back enough we have to look at
when Intel decided to officially launch
six cores and consumer grade ships and
see if that at all coincided with any
Intel that might have leaked Intel I
mean like you know information that
might have leaked from AMD side of
things when it came to their production
or potential production of horizon six
core CPUs main stream CPUs so I'm not
sure I would say it definitely had
something to do with it just off the top
of my head I'm sure it would be stupid
if Intel didn't respond by doing that
joki Kelly hey science so I'm building
my first PC and my total budget is
seventeen hundred dollars that includes
the PC monitor and peripherals you have
any suggestions on the build and monitor
like you know just I can't really
suggest full-on pcs for you
I don't really have the time special
livestream to do to you know I can't go
through all that stuff specifically it
as a client you know I
do that it takes too long but you know
in that price range you're looking at
around I five territory get a 1070 1080
16 gigs around and then get a decent
1440p monitor for three four hundred
bucks they can overclock maybe 10 120
Hertz there you go
cam pay any tips for updating uploading
bios windows and overclocking on the
computer after building cam a I have
videos of how to upload how to update
BIOS is actually a recent one with the
horizon second gen and B through 50 go
look the video up that's why it's up
there are Fe way I missed it I missed it
I missed it I'm sorry I missed it so
many questions thank you for all the
questions okay shad Pinelli hey greg
planning to do a 2600 build and wanted
to go with the asus rog crosshair 7 hero
a motherboard is it worth pairing with
the 22nd red X or is it overkill it's
perfectly fine lucky added features
anyway as an extra 70 chipset I'm pretty
sure that's nice for 70 bored pretty
sure all already boards are that are in
that lineup so yeah it's not gonna hurt
at all and you could probably squeak out
maybe an extra 100 megahertz or so but
I'm it's kind of its kind of difficult
to tell I would say you're fine with
going with that if you want to save
money you certainly could be 350 s are
still viable even for the 2600 X so it
depends on what you prioritize I think
you're getting a better looking board in
most cases with the X 417 chipset anyway
so and more features just something to
think about
okay post-apocalyptic Peter it's going
on my dude think of that $10 super chat
found your channel around Christmas
great content now my favorite I
appreciate that I want to build pcs no
Channel just build wait for RAM to drop
thinking $100 build cost you mean
thousand dollar bill cost I'm confused
oh you all I see you're saying no you
want to build pcs I get it I get as a
business so 100 I build cost right so
that's on top of the build cost or on
top of the parts that's basically $100
make buyer get on windows key what do
you think
I think getting your own windows key I
think if you tell the buyer to get his
own windows key or her windows a key I
think that's a bit of a turn-off because
what a lot of customers want right it's
just that one-time sale that one-time
purchase and it's just plug and play all
right how would you feel if you bought a
ps4 console and then you had to load the
BIOS on the ps4 right so it's an extra
step that should have already been done
in the shop I recommend use sources
Windows Keys yourself plenty of places
to get them you can get them on eBay and
get them on SCE key and get them on King
win doesn't matter we just did a video
on sed key those work perfectly fine so
you could get them from any of those
sites and then still charge that hundred
dollar or so markup I would say the the
way I do it is a 10 percent markup I
don't charge any more than 10 percent if
I build a PC for a customer and if I
don't know the person I usually just
build it for free if I know the person
but if you know someone to put the time
and effort into it for the sake of you
know just trying to turn a small profit
which is what 10 percent ultimately is
it's pretty small at once in the context
of most PC builds you know having the
windows key and already in there having
Windows already installed well I don't
know I guess all you're really doing is
having them enter the key but I would
just do that yourself because then you
just say all right here it is ready to
go just plug and play simple as that
even entering a key not just installing
the operating system which I assume
you're gonna do but entering the key to
activate the software is just something
that I think that the seller should do
up front so I'm not too sure how how you
feel about it but that's what I would do
I would try to have the operating system
already ready to go excuse me Maran whoo
whooping garner what a name question
looking for advice would I get more out
of upgrading my cooler or motherboard
for overclocking currently on a B 350 or
the rise in 1600 using stock cool or 3.8
gigahertz excuse me all right so at the
with the rise in 1600 you're pretty much
gonna be close to maxed out you might
depending on your chip if your
temperatures are limiting you it's going
to be the cooler that's your limiting
factor if your temperatures are still
pretty low but you're you're not getting
stable overclocks past 3.8 or maybe have
to push
voltage or whatever it could be a
motherboard issue and be 350s are gonna
be slightly less efficient when it comes
to power delivery for high overclocks
right so I would say it's more than
likely you're cooler but you have a 1600
which is already a low TDP chip it's not
gonna overclock much higher than 3.8 to
begin with I would be content with where
you are you're already fine there I
would be content with that I actually
have the same overclock on my 1600 just
because it's a little cooler it's a
little more stable okay
scrolling - what's up creek tonic HD
everyone make sure to check out
verdaguer for your city needs Krypton
are gonna make you a want to make you a
moderator Krypton ik he's a very cool
dude he's always hanging around and I
like that Alexander Padilla
do you get up and work normal hours or
do you get up whenever and go from there
I used to get up whenever I really try
to get up early cuz it's just I am so
much more productive when I wake up
early but if I sleep in one day like if
I'm like earth to Monday I'm gonna sleep
in because I'm just I can do that right
because I work for myself the rest of my
day is crap because I woke up so late
and I just woke up such Rowsey because
it was such a slow morning so if I wake
up earlier I feel like crap immediately
right no one likes to wake up early but
I get more stuff done and I'm trying to
be better about that I really am
drew B what's going on my dude hey Greg
man can you answer my questions well
drew B it would be better if let me see
him scrolling down in here did you ask a
question in super chat I don't see it oh
I see it and I see it now have you
studied music theory being a guitarist I
did a little bit yeah I mean I I studied
for I would say about six months learn
how to read music I could pretty much
read and play at the same time on guitar
but it was never it never really took
off for me just because I I always
played by ear I could just hear a note
and know exactly what the note was I
could hear a song basically pick up the
you know the main notes the the rhythm I
would say within the first two or three
minutes
just because I played so long so that's
yeah that's how I did that's why I know
a little music theory but I just wasn't
as I wasn't as passionate about the
music theory side of things tech nose
via whatever $56 and in or 56 is it
Indian rupees or whatever I don't know
anyway thank you for that
check my question and check it doesn't
it doesn't fit $2,000 PC what am i
checking here in what chat I don't see
your chat you should have asked your
question Technosphere in the super chat
if you did already I'm sorry but I don't
see it in here nope I found to get
scrolling down Wow I was called cool by
Gregg time to clip this video forever
Crypton Acadie I appreciate your help
yeah ben b says sleeping in - whenever
kills your motivation it really does
guys it really does it's something you
won't really realize until you work for
yourself and you kind of have to be
self-motivated and it's a really
difficult thing to be when you know you
think to yourself oh you know I already
have videos on the channel they're kind
of already making money for me right
people are still viewing my video that's
really not true because the attrition
rate on videos drops heavily after the
first day so unless the video goes viral
or something it's it's shared on a lot
of forums and Reddit and what have you
the videos usually stop making any
substantial amount of money after the
first 24 to 36 hours so you have to be
motivated you have to be on your on your
game and and you have to be able to make
more videos every other day or so at
least to keep a steady revenue stream
because if you don't let me tell you
you're not gonna get enough views on the
content you've already made we have 500
videos in this channel if I stop making
videos my revenue would be cut 75% and
that's in the first week and I know that
because I've done it okay let's see yeah
scrolling down to some more what's your
opinion on the GT 1030 pretty much
pretty much pointless at this point if
you want to get a 24-hour G you're gonna
get similar performance there
maybe even slightly better I'm not sure
I don't remember if it's slightly better
or worse but the 24 to G pretty much
knocks out all cheap graphics cards in
my opinion midget says skip over me one
more time Greg I swear dude smidge it do
you understand how many comments are
showing up in the chat right now you are
not entitled to an answer I'm trying my
best but I might not get to everybody I
hate to break it to you I'm sorry about
that
okay Hank Buckley asked how are you
doing tonight my dude I'm doing all
right
thanks for asking I appreciate that how
are you doing tonight I appreciate you
stopping by the live stream for sure
that's something that I know is no easy
task on a Sunday night when he got work
and whatever school maybe the next day I
appreciate you guys doing this
Omar zine he asks what are your favorite
gaming peripherals and also what is your
PC running okay I'm not sure if this
headsets under NDA still I'm gonna fix
I'm gonna assume it it's not but I want
to give them a shout-out because like I
wasn't the biggest fan of the courser of
wood pros the the void Pro is just a
really loose fitting headset I could
never get it to sit firmly on my head I
didn't like the microphone and the
battery was okay it was a wireless
headset I hated charging it this one's
the same way I guess in that sense but
that's that that's something I can't
fault this for or the quad pro for
because it's just that's charged
headsets in general wireless ones but
these here these are really nice and
these fit very snug they don't look too
bad they've got this like faux like
cloth cross-stitch to leather or
whatever this is up here for you know
the top of the head and a nice foam
padding very comfortable headset very
conservative looking I think it looks
great in white and I'm gonna review it
in a dedicated video but this is
something I really like here and then I
also have I use cooler master keyboards
these are master keys I'd have to
double-check Mk no I don't know for sure
I'm getting all my keyboards and
mice names confused so they all use like
weird nomenclature but I used
coolermaster keyboards and pretty much
all my keyboards at this point and then
I use either Coolermaster mice or I'll
use g.skill mice that's just that's just
what I've used for the longest time so
I'm kind of just content with that cuz I
don't want to change it up changing mice
is super weird it's super weird okay um
let's see yeah I see a lot of these if
you spammed chat you gonna get click
with the S mmm-hmm see this fan I see it
mm-hmm mr. K F gaming thanks again for
sponsoring I'm sorry to see you go but
uh thanks for stopping by for sure
playing game with your girlfriend man
that's that's a sweet combo right there
it's awesome you gotta grow plays games
with you we all know YouTube can really
swallow channels up and push them to the
bottom both show I appreciate that thank
you again for your support okay
scrolling down a little more fly flier
srr asked if you and your girlfriend
still get married - I'm assuming the
same girl you're talking about but we're
married now so surprised we this is all
stuff that we talk about on Twitter and
Instagram so if you don't follow us on
social media I would probably wait on
now so why haven't you given into a good
lavell ear microphone I actually have
krypton Akai actually have a few lav
mics they're really cheap like 20 bucks
and they're great laughs mics really
start to degrade in quality up to you
know the law of diminishing returns
applies to lavalier mics I would say
around 50 to 100 bucks you can buy $100
sure lavalier mics sure makes excellent
microphones it's not gonna sound much
different than a twenty dollar laughing
like if it's made correctly so I've
never wanted to spend a ton of money on
on them okay yeah I'm gonna do a few
more
my throat is shot and I had a I had a
sprint over here
someone said wait what's a girlfriend
you guys are good you guys are awesome
okay I see a couple super Chet you
didn't get to these first let's see you
know joke eek Ellie asks science what's
the hardest part of building a PC that's
stupid rear i/o shield that's the
hardest part yeah set it
post-apocalyptic Peter $5 super Chet
thinking bud
yes all your sadiki's video appreciate
it man thanks again for the awesome
content might wait for RAM to drop I'll
let you know how it goes for sure my
dude that will be would be good to know
and yeah let me know how the how the
venture plays out I'm curious to see how
will you do there
I've given it some thought to actually
it's just it's it's a really fun hobby
but at the same time you can turn it
into a business which is the best of
both worlds so off kimura a roy
chowdhury thanking for that 100 Indian
rupee is it rupees I don't I get rupees
rubles I get all those mixed up but
anyway 100 whatever that is to thank for
the super chat hey man I got my first PC
how can I show you my build your videos
help me out a lot I got the gtx 1070
founders is that okay founders edition
is perfectly fine actually it's a pretty
sweet overclock so founders edition
despite being a blower style card it's
very well built
I love how heavy and sturdy it is it's
actually a really great card for what it
is coming direct from Nvidia so yeah no
problem there it's not gonna run too
loud either as I proved in my last video
so perfectly fine there you can show me
your bill by the way if you follow me on
Twitter you can just tweet it at me I
check all my tweets basically every hour
or so so if I see it from you I'll be
sure to retweet it scrolling down to one
more thing John des Champs about to
build my first PC what's your most
important tip most important tip hmm
that's a tough question most important
tip there's a lot of little tiny things
that you want to just watch out for I
would say just don't screw up your
motherboard pins or your CPU pins
depending on its LG RPG a CPU or socket
so uh don't mess that stuff up so that's
that's a pain to fix just be very
careful when you set your CPU into the
socket you want to go in nice and slow
you guys know all right
scrolling up just a little bit more
missed this one here but by Jay sone yes
ball man ski think that 5 pound donation
a super chat thank you my dude do you
invest in cryptocurrency if so why if
not why I do not touch cryptocurrency
I don't Mayan I don't invest in it I
don't have any money
tied into any kind of cryptocurrency
because I think that it's just the most
unregulated cesspool right now it's just
I just find so many issues with it it's
so unstable you can't predict it you
can't be confident and really anything
unless you have inside information which
I guess isn't regulated by the SEC yet
but whatever it will be that's what I
mean though it's so unregulated it's
just a cesspool of crap and I don't
wanna get into it I feel like I would
just over speculate make the wrong
decision one day and lose everything I
don't I don't like those kinds of odds
okay techy pocket asks when are you
going to live with the yes-man Brian and
I we Brian and I go way back
I'm seeking yeah Brian's a really cool
dude I got a lot respect for Brian and
he's a no BS kind of guy says straight
up how he feels and I like that I like
that uh he he's actually gonna we're
gonna try to hang out in Taiwan this
year for Computex we're gonna try to do
a couple videos together it'd be really
cool to do some collabs with other tech
tubers in person right instead of just
on a live stream so we'll see how that
goes but I really like Brian brands
really cool guys you guys don't know
tech yeah City I don't know what rock
you're living under but you should
definitely go check them out and you
won't regret that so okay fly your SLR
yeah he says YouTube Facebook Twitter
snapchat I know you I know I'm sorry we
don't have snapchat by the way unless
your patreon supporter whatever but yeah
I understand it's a lot of outlets
Twitter is the best one though if you
want to communicate with me personally
Twitter's the best way to do that or
Facebook Messenger but that's Facebook
Messenger is one you might not get a
response right away with that one
because there's a lot of people message
in that okay a couple more questions
here a couple more questions Daniel II
all good my dude no I know you're not
discourage no it's all good okay okay I
see these questions here Mary Ryan hi
Greg how are you I love your content
Thank You Vera appreciate it I'm
planning my first gaming PC build 2560 X
or 2560 by 1440 60 Hertz with an i3 250
K at 1070 but I've able to drive Triple
A games your your CPU is probably gonna
be the limiting factor but it's an 80 50
K right the i3 is remember from coffee
leaks lineup have at least four cores or
not at least they have four cores
unless I'm living under a rock but I'm
pretty sure that they now have for
course so seeing as though they have
four cores right last gen stuff KB Lake
stuff I five sided four core is
basically comparable to 8th gen I 3s ran
games perfectly fine in most cases it's
you're definitely be limited more by
your CPU I would say in the long run but
for now it's fine
Triple A games I don't think you have a
problem driving them but again your CPU
will be the limiting factor so that
might be the first thing you upgrade if
you decide to in the future ok I'm
Batman that's his name folks should I
buy a GPU now or wait for the new ones
that are rumored to come out soon
I don't know Batman do you need one now
or do you need one two months from now
depends I can't answer the question for
because I don't know how bad you lis
need one but if you need one now just
buy a used one now I would say or try to
you know refresh in videos website
consistently until a graphics card shows
back up and stock but anyway the anthro
one I know I got to go with fun hanging
out see ya thanks my dude it was uh
again I appreciate all you guys stopping
by even if it's just for a few seconds
it's awesome ok techne pocket anyone
ever get startled when Greg calls your
name T&amp;amp;T thief says I hit that red
button and gave that gray Bell a little
tap mod dude appreciate you I appreciate
that star ninja star ninja lol can a
courser h 100 IV 2 on an 80 700 K at 4.7
gig overclocked at good temp depends on
your ski on on your specific chip it
should handle it fine those are pretty
sweet a iOS from course there but you
might need a D lid and I don't recommend
deleting less you're super comfortable
with it but you might need to deal it so
it really depends on the specific chip
you have some i7s run super hot from
that generation from the previous one
because Intel puts the crappiest Tim in
between a die and the IHS moving frag
moving frag thank you for that $10 super
chat mod dude first time water cooling
is it easier to go with bending tubes or
straight tubes and 90-degree adapters
definitely easier with 90-degree
adapters I don't think it looks as good
there's not as much technique clearly
involved with it but you could I mean
you could pull off an
you know straight to cool custom loop
with 90-degree bends it you can still
make those look really good so if you're
a little on edge about it like I just
don't fall on in too hard to bending
right but that was really the only
difficult part anyway like if I go I'm a
soft tube bending like there's no
challenge there it's just getting your
runs correct but that takes no effort
basically at all hard tubing is that is
the real challenge and even if you go
with straight tubes in 90 90s it's it's
still a challenge because you're gonna
line things up you might have things
still not line up horizontally or
vertically with your case and the rest
your components that's a pet peeve of
mine but if you're a little uncertain
you're a little on edge straight tubes
with 90s is fine that's a good intro
scrolling back up scrolling back up
Canty thief I literally just gave you
got it you got a shout out when I said
your name that's your shoutout
when you want from me rusty Shackleford
what's the deal with the Vega card still
going for obscene prices are they still
that good for cryptocurrency mining the
smaller currencies those are excellent
cards for cryptocurrency mining mainly
because they have it part of it has to
do with the the way that the software
mines right and you know the resources
that utilize not going to detail because
frankly you haven't done enough research
know that I know that plays a role but
in general there are more stream
processors and these things than than
the equivalent CUDA cores with you know
similarly powered Nvidia cards so in
general they're typically better it's
like the RX board used 580 sold out so
quick when the mining craze hit an
all-time high but it honestly anyway I
wouldn't even consider Vega 56 64 I
think they were flops for the most part
you can't find him they're overpriced
because they're not replenishing stock
enough because an AMD quickly realized
that these cards were gonna have issues
in the market and you know they're
decent for what they are similar to 1070
and 1080 performance respectively
between the 56 and 64 but if you're
gonna go something that high they're
that powerful I would go with ain't with
Nvidia excuse me at this point until we
get something that's it's just a bit
more reliable from a market sense from a
price perspective and frankly that's
just priced a little more aggressive we
expect a little more out of AMD on the
value side of things and I think Vega 56
and 64 were just priced a little too
high to compete at least compete
directly with Nvidia and AMD alright
with NVIDIA not AMD anyway
is it enough using deep cool captain 240
X for CPU overclocking Alief yes it is I
have a video specifically on the 240 X
you should watch it ok Matt see hey Greg
most suitable AO for my 49 30 K and a
half x case thoughts/opinions
move man that's a tough one you could go
with any I would say fit for 49 30 K I
would go with probably at least a 240
mil that'll give you enough buffer room
it that's that's what I would say ok
then be asked what triggers you more bad
cable management or thermal paste
application I would say cable management
just because unless you have a really
terrible case like cable management is
purely just an effort thing right you
can fix your cables if you really cared
about your cables and that's why
sometimes I pointed out on Craigslist
reviews when I do I read craigslist ads
on the videos you know if you're gonna
sell a PC for more than you paid for it
you're gonna be very blatant about the
fact that you paid a certain amount
you're gonna try to act like it's worth
more but it's really not right you're
gonna pass it off as a more expensive
system at least manage your cables in
your freakin PC like that takes no
effort at all just shows that you didn't
care about the build enough to make it
look pretty and that tells me something
about the individual selling the PC and
I don't get a good impression from that
so I weigh it heavily because I just
think you know it's like a clean room
it's like a clean house if you if you
walk into a house and somebody hoards
trash and you can't even walk on the
floor because there's just trash
everywhere do you really want to buy you
know anything else from that person I
mean really anything that sits in the
house or maybe even the car do you want
to buy a car from somebody who is a
really trashy house if they just don't
care to keep up with things I don't
think so
so it's an impression that don't like so
you know good luck there Matt I see you
I see your coming again looking into
that 240ml AIO I don't think that's a a
bad idea
I think you'd be happy with that uh-oh
rusty says oh boy I'm glad Greg doesn't
know about my cable management the mesh
if I see how can your cable management
the mesh if I CD that bad though you
just shove all the cables into that
little left indented panel there right
beside the motherboard tray that's
that's why I like the mesh if I see so
much because it's so easy to cable
management anyway Drago
Fang 1060 says it's gotta go I
appreciate you stopping by we have just
over 200 viewers watching right now I'm
sorry for those who just tuned in what
we're gonna be wrapping this up very
soon my voice is shot it is so just I'm
just so thirsty I should've brought
water in here but I rushed home and I
immediately got on the PC so dinner even
though it's 10:30 I'm gonna have dinner
and I will drink some water to quench my
thirst all right one more question
let's see you guys got a good question
I'll give you a couple seconds here to
listen to that and I want to see your
questions roll in it's got to be good
all right
one more question Nickolas reef asks how
many people work a science studio how
people work part-time but they're not
like it's not an official thing will
helps me a lot on the side will does a
lot for us and he'll be come once again
to copy text and then my wife Lisa
I guess works with me I mean obviously
she you know I she has her own job right
now but she also worked with me on the
side so I guess that's the third person
in science to do I see the questions
rolling in I see them give me the good
stuff when the good stuff all right
I see it I see it oh yeah looking good
okay here we go d-david real quick you
asked whether they fastest fps and I can
see I literally have a video on that
David you should type it in how many FPS
can you see science to do in the search
bar or the first video that comes up I
hope there you go zombie civvies ready
there for Chan dude what's going on
zombies I just got a 1080 for 600 Merkin
good deal yeah it's not it's not a great
deal it's more than MSRP but with
inflated prices it's not too bad I would
say probably could have found it a
little cheaper somewhere else but hey at
least you got a 1080 right
flyer sr goodnight congratulations with
your marriage to Lisa we appreciate that
thank you I know she would appreciate it
as well okay here's the last question
angles 7 1 1 you asked how I started
building pcs I have a video literally
talking about that actually multiple
times that you should go back and watch
a couple of my how I started my youtube
channel how I financed my youtube
channel have those videos on the channel
you should watch them ok oh great let's
answer greats question hey I've been
wondering if it is good to purchase my
first gaming PC that I put together an
i-5 7500 a gtx 1050 TI a 700 a 500 watt
BQ power supply a b250 motherboard 8
gigs of ram and ddr4 2400 depending on
your budget grape that's a tough
question it's a really tough question
it's a it's a good starter build the
1050 Ti is enough for some average 1080p
gaming the i5 7500 is enough for 1080p
gaming maybe a little more than that on
the CPC side of things but it's not a
bad build I would say the first thing
you should probably upgrade is either
your RAM or your graphics card and then
from there you might want to upgrade
your platform in the future so thanks
you guys for watching I appreciate all
of you stopping by to watch the live
stream on this Sunday night or Monday
morning depending on where you live we
have these going live every Sunday night
here our Monday morning again depending
on where you live we call these the
after-hours live streams this is the
11th one if you guys want to sponsor us
you get added perks like you wouldn't
which you get the extra badges in the
chat box you get the badges in the
comments section get access to a private
discord server you get access to
snapchat you get access to what else I'm
trying to think of some other things you
guys get you would access to private
live streams I'll enter questions
specifically from you guys and only you
guys so we'll have all that stuff you
know that's all rolling out now on so
you should get it if you decide to
sponsor I appreciate it even if you just
consider it thank you guys for watching
the livestream we'll be back here next
week at this time again science studio
out that's probably the dumbest outro
open anyway I'll see you guys later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
