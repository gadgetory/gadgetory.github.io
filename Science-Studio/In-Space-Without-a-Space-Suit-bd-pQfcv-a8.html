congratulate the four winners of the two
contests we had running this week so
silly and amber as for the two winners
of the 8-gigabyte rx for ATS and Jared
and Josh were the two winners of the two
captain 240 X all-in-one radiator combos
one of which I'm sporting in my own
personal rig so let's cut to the chase
space it's empty right well for the most
part there are trace gas molecules
zooming around namely hydrogen and
depending on where you are you could
find anywhere from just one atom for
cubic meter of outer space to several
million of them within the same volume
but that's still nothing compared to
Earth's atmosphere interstellar and
intergalactic space tends to be the most
void and thus will be used for this
representation so imagine yourself
floating between galaxies say between
the Milky Way and Andromeda you were
eleven point eight ish can tell Ian
kilometers away from Earth and away from
anything else for that matter so let's
take her space it off here boom done
you're in a vacuum but nothing happens
at first at all you aren't instantly
frozen you didn't explode you're just
floating and you can still see things
you can still move around so what's
missing
well oxygen your body is still
functioning normally at this point
internally but it needs o to and don't
try holding your breath and forcing your
mouth to stay closed space comm points
out that doing so would result in your
lungs expanding and finally exploding
try this at your own risk if you're up
for a challenge close your mouth and
force as much air as you possibly can
out through your nose essentially
deflating your lungs and then just when
you think you can't deflate your lungs
anymore keep going don't don't go until
you pass out but you get the point even
when you feel like you have no more air
to expel keep going and that is exactly
what space would feel like on your lungs
just picture them shrinking shrinking a
lot but as your long shrink your body
itself will begin to expand slowly like
a balloon to twice its size nitrogen in
your blood does the same thing oxygen
would if you tried to hold your breath
it expands essentially boiling points of
fluids within your vessels reduce things
that should be in the liquid state
within your body turn into gases a NASA
test subject in 1965 was exposed to near
vacuum conditions and reported that
before he ended up passing out about 14
seconds in that the saliva on his tongue
and in his mouth began to boy
so yeah not good so first your hands
then your feet then the rest of your
body would all expand but not to worry
that is not what kills you and no it's
not the temperature of space either
we've all been told that space is cold
very cold and that's accurate but only
on a molecular level
simply put there isn't enough convection
and molecular conduction in space to
freeze you quick enough it would take
several minutes two hours before your
skin even show the first signs of
frostbite as a result of temperature in
space
your body's radiating losing heat but
not at a fast enough pace to kill you
first
that my friends is thanks to
asphyxiation asphyxiation
remember the thing about lungs they
don't like vacuums because in that kind
of environment they cannot hold oxygen
no oxygen no organ function first your
brain then your other vital organs after
roughly 20 seconds of deep space
exposure you've blacked out and another
minute after that you're you're dead so
no you won't immediately freeze you
won't immediately explode and you won't
immediately boil you'll just slowly
suffocate to death and in space no one
can hear you scream a sci-fi movie got
that right there's two empty or there's
not enough molecules this is science to
do thanks for learning with us did I do
that in under four minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
