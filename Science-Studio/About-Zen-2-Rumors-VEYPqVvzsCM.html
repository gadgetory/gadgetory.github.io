away Zen - is technically the rise in
3000 series the rise in 2000 series was
technically n + whose architecture was
heavily reliant in the original 40
nanometers then architecture I feel as
though people get those confused quite a
bit and to be honest I really don't
blame you but what we'll be discussing
in this video is Zen - those are the
suppose that rise in 3,000 serious CPUs
and I'm sure by this point you've seen a
rumor or two so let's zip through the
bullsh and rationalize just a little bit
this video is brought to you by a builds
dot GG it's a brand new site dedicated
sharing PC builds and hosting friendly
competitions you can browse builds by
location as a country form-factor color
I mean there are so many different ways
to kind of filter results which is a
great thing if you especially want to
draw an inspiration for future builds
and to kick off a launch builds GG's
creators are giving away a Titan RTX and
graphics card the site is 100% free to
use you just got to sign up and the
giveaway entry is technically free as
well so in my opinion it's a win one
click the link below and start sharing
today the seven nanometer Zen - process
is discussed in this video right here in
case you're wondering but in this video
I want to look specifically at the
rumors floating around I feel like most
tech channels have already covered the
rumors but I want to talk about the
frequency charts cue lists basically
these right here and there seems to be
at least one outlet willing to leak
information and garner hundreds of
thousands of clicks I get it it's the
business we're in but rather than
sulking in the beauty of what may be
incredible crisis for tons of cores and
frequencies as high as five gigahertz
I'll be looking at these charts very
critically a skepticism is healthy and I
encourage everyone to do a fair bit of
research before concluding with rip
Intel or rip AMD although we've been
hearing rip until a lot lately because
these leaks have been so popular because
I can assure you
Intel isn't going anywhere anytime soon
right so let's start with the officials
end to leak this is the first one we saw
several YouTube channels covered this
chart and as a result many became amped
for for the launch which we now expect
will be sometime in q1 or q2 2019 we
might even see them announce these CPUs
is CES though we don't expect to be able
to buy these as general consumers until
around July it usually
three to six months for these processes
actually at the market so just because
you see them announced at CES it does
not mean that anytime soon you be able
to buy them so when people say oh wait
for a rise in 3000 well you might be
waiting upwards of six months so if you
need a PC now it might just be worth
buying something on the cheap maybe even
use off in the time being but like this
chart right here as my BS detector going
off in all kinds of directions what
concerns me the most is that this chart
is extremely detailed we usually see a
few specs fall through the cracks here
and there but I mean come on a full ski
will break down with prices frequencies
tvp's and core counts I don't know about
this one we first saw this pop up in
late 2018 by the way so it looks like
the lowest core accountants n2 is 6
which would be a radical shift of true
six cores and twelve threads with a
boost clock of four gigahertz well I
mean that doesn't seem too far out of
touch we're already seeing rise in 1600
CPUs touching the $100 price point at
time so I could definitely see AMD doing
something similar with the new
generation it just it's kind of
mind-boggling to think that they would
completely get rid of quad-core
hyper-threaded CPUs especially
considering I mean if you're ready
charging a hundred bucks for the six
core variant why not make a fork or a
thread variant that sells for 60 bucks
sixty five dollars and you get the ultra
you know ultra budget oriented consumers
involved as well so to me it feels like
a missed opportunity unless they plan on
releasing the CTS later on which is sort
of Lee speaking that would be probably
what they'll do
oh one more thing this TDP is it's oddly
low this would be an incredible feat for
TSMC if true and what I'm really
intrigued by here is the supposin at
3600 g8 core 16 threads 3.8 gigahertz a
boost clock that's usually across one
core though keep that in mind and
supposedly 20 mega compute units that
would be pretty incredible the TDP seems
to scale correctly from that of the non
AP counterpart the regular 3 3600 but
I'd be awfully surprised with the price
disparity between these two what's this
small I think my biggest degree of
skepticism though stems from the price
as well as the fact that it could all be
contained in just a 95 watt package I
mean I'm not even seeing how even with
the new fab AMD could manage eight cores
and 16 threads and 20 mega cores into a
95
YTD p then again intel managed the same
thing with the 9900 k though it often
runs far out of TDP spec when even a
single switch is flipped in the BIOS so
maybe that's the case here as well we
start venturing into unknown territory
though at the horizon 7 mark 12 cores 24
threads and somehow a 5 gigahertz boost
clock call me old-fashioned but since
when has AMD delivered both high core
count chips and excellent overclockers
at the same time and no bulldozer
doesn't count more on that right here
what I'm honestly thinking when I look
at the section of the chart is that
these specs are too good to be true
keep in mind the boost clock again is
just relating to a single core typically
where as we'd expect all cores to
manually clock somewhere in the realm of
maybe four point six to four point eight
gigahertz depending on your luck with
the silicon lottery but even so managing
to push drift a single core in such a
dense 12 core package to 5 gigahertz
would be an impressive feat it's one of
the reasons why I'm so doubtful here and
the last one over here on the far right
just just seems totally out of touch
with reality 16 cores 32 threads and a
boost clock of 4.7 gigahertz are they
mad first of all if we assume 4 cores
per CC X that'll put this thing at 2 CC
x's for a die and 2 dies in the package
same thing as a 2950 ax targeted at
workstations mind you how on earth could
AMD managed to cram 16 conventional
cores to a package small enough to fit
in your typical amp or socket is beyond
me call that the miracle 7 nanometre
tech and to top things off a boost clock
of 5.1 gigahertz look I know it's a
single core boost but still in a package
this dense even getting a single core
anywhere close to that frequency would
be a massive accomplishment perhaps
we'll see how when AMD opens up in the
coming months about the relationship
with tsmc but for now I am definitely
skeptical about the supposed 3100 X and
3850 x now transition to 2019 we've got
apparently a Russian online retailer
leaking the exact same specs for
identically ninja few starting with the
3300 and working up to the 3100 X it's
perfectly plausible to assume that they
just ripped this chart from the leaks
previously announced in 2018 and decided
to plaster this up on their website just
to draw traffic you know people do that
but an interesting note here is that the
38 50 X with 5 or so gigahertz boost
clock isn't listed in fact I'll admit up
to this point I was extremely doubtful
it's easy for someone to fudge these
numbers
pump them on a site like Reddit or
wherever to build hype and instant fame
I could have made the exact same chart
on Microsoft Paint if I really felt so
inclined but now that we're seeing two
very different outlets published
identical specifications despite the
fact that one of these outlets is a
Russian Erie tailor with which I know
next to nothing I've come to give these
figures a bit more consideration and
again to be honest if I was AMD this is
exactly what I'd want but only if these
rumors were in fact accurate you see if
I had let's say a hot new product ready
to launch this year a car that could do
0 to 60 in two seconds flat and then I
found a bunch of random sites leaking
and correct info about how supposedly my
new car could hit 60 and say 1.4 seconds
I'd be pretty pissed why because it
would elevate my consumer bases
expectations of my product the hype
would literally be detrimental to my
sales so when the car finally launches
and people realize the acceleration
isn't what they thought it would be
despite the fact that 0 to 60 in two
seconds is still incredible they'll be
disappointed nonetheless and possibly be
dissuaded from purchasing it same goes
for CPUs AMD wants to hype their
products what company doesn't but the
moment inaccurate and potentially
harmful information hits the public and
it spreads like wildfire you'd better
believe they'll be running damage
control and maybe that was AMD's intent
behind the sudden CES announcement maybe
they feel the need to set the record
straight or maybe they feel the need to
fan the flames we really won't know
until they announce things so I'm
honestly on the fence about this one up
until recently I was extremely skeptical
you could say but as more outlets
confirm these initial reports I can't
help but get excited we're even seeing
engineering samples now of the 12 and 16
core variants just out there supposedly
there are two different engineering
samples out there now that people have
been talking about on the DL but
nonetheless if they exist as engineering
samples that means that they could
possibly be released at the same time as
the other SKUs which would mean that AMD
is in fact pushing for a 16 core
consumer grade CPU again not sure how
the heck they're gonna do that on a
traditional am4 like socket but yeah I
mean
if anything they have plans for another
16 core CPU but if it is in fact a
consumer-grade chip then that's gonna
radically change things and look even if
none of what we're seeing here ends up
coming true I've still got high hopes
for Sun - we've been talking about it
for quite some time Intel's 10 nanometer
prospect which is arguably more dense
and advanced than TSM c7 nanometer
because it's just marketing hype at this
point hasn't looked very promising as of
late so we may only have then - to
compete with current gaming kings like
the AI 990 900k what do you think I'm
honestly curious about how many of you
buy into this chart does it seem too
good to be true how about the pricing
what I'm you know what in particular has
your PS radar going off I guess is what
I should ask if anything at all as
always I invite you leave comment down
below these discussions are always juicy
and I'll be sure to jump me from time to
time as well if you like this video
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
feeling you know what to do click that
red subscribe button if you haven't
already become a channel member if
you're feeling especially lucky and I'll
catch you in the next video where we
will be filming and at CES we'll be in
Vegas so I guess that's not really a
spoiler since it's pretty obvious that
was coming up but I'm excited about
content that we have to bring you guys
next week so stay tuned this is science
studio thanks for talking about rumors
