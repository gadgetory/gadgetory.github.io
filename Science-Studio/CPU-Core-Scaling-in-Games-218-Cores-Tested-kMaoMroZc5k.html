video you probably thought yourself
there goes Greg jumping off the deep end
there's absolutely no chance we'll ever
recover from his illness of testing
pointless things and yes the 18 core
79-80 XE from Intel is rather pointless
for gaming and content creation alike
and I've proved that in the past you can
check out this video right here for more
details but I also want to stress that
there is relevance behind the test I'm
going to show you in this video because
I want to see where the fall-off point
is right when does having the X number
of CPU cores stop mattering for gaming
in particular and I don't have the most
intensive CPU games to throw in this
video I use GTA 5 and I use universe and
box to bt5 is a good leverage of both
the GPU and CPU horsepower I say that a
lot and universe and box 2 is just a cpu
killer point blank so again the point of
the video we're gonna analyze CPU core
scaling across titles we're gonna see
when games stop caring about how many
cores you have in your system and we'll
also throw in a streaming option so if
you want to stream via OBS which is I
would say pretty common then we're gonna
have that running in the background I
just stream to a youtube server but it's
not actually going live that's why
nothing showed up live on YouTube but
the streaming the encoding is all
happening there in the background and
you'll see that set of benchmarks
subsequently so let's start first with
GTA 5 again a balanced game it's
actually a pretty clean port much better
than GTA 4 was I think they had to make
up for that loss there and this one was
to be expected by the way if you want to
mimic these tests with your own setup
you can hop into your system bios if
it's relatively modern don't say
something like number of cores active
there usually a button you had a change
from automatic to manual when you do
that you'll be able to turn off
individual course course me having 18
here took a while to disable 16 of them
we had to start at 2 and I doubled it to
4 and then I activated 6 and then 8 and
so on all the way up to 18 you're
probably wondering why I only bench 2
games in this video it's because it took
so long to run all of these benchmarks
it was literally nine benchmarks per
title and then I had to multiply each of
those diamonds too because I was also
streaming in half of those so you have 9
benchmarks from each game without
streaming and the 9 with streaming of
the total of what 36 benchmarks so
yeah I was up all night and as for GTA 5
in 1080p with very high settings no
anti-aliasing no advanced graphics so as
to not offset the leverage to the
graphics card at 2 cores we saw an
average of 96% CPU utilization
I also saw one core consistently peaking
at 100% utilization and that's to be
expected right I mean look at all four
of these threads here with
multi-threading or in this case hyper
threading enabled all of them were
pretty much maxed out across the board
that again declined to 81% when we
activated four cores which is
essentially you know an older era i7
processor right 4 cores and 8 threads
and then up to 6 cores we dropped to 68%
and then to start at level off at 8
cores and 64 percent so this is actually
pretty interesting that flat line there
I think indicates where the optimization
stops right so if you have an extra you
know 4 coursepack dog they're not really
gonna be able as much at all few of
those threads will just you know idle
around 10% or so utilization and that's
to be expected if Windows is gonna
offset those background tasks right to
those extra cores that aren't being
utilized successfully by the game which
will be averaging anywhere between 60 to
100 percent if the game is utilizing the
CPU cores effectively and that's what
you want to look for if your CPU ization
is really low then you probably have
either graphics card bottleneck or just
poor optimization in general but we saw
a pretty high utilization for a few of
the cores and then the rest of them
especially in that again 10 or 12 core
territory were fairly low at around 10%
and that's why average utilization
continued to drop past 8 cores we saw it
at 51% for 10 cores then 39% 29% 24% and
18% so that's literally just you know
the average of all the core so the ones
that aren't being utilized are again
pulling an average utilization down and
now with streaming in the background via
OBS to youtube the same game GTA 5 and
1080p with the same presets we see a
hundred percent utilization at two cores
that's to be expected right don't buy
and an older i3 to stream and play video
games on that that's why you don't want
to do that because the utilization will
be maxed out it was actually maxed out
too or pretty close to it at four cores
and eight threads which is why Rison is
actually such
compelling offer right now because you
can get you know six or eight cores
which gives you plenty of lead way for
streaming and gaming albeit maybe it's
slightly lower frame rates but you do
have that overhead available if you want
to multitask also something else to note
the flat trend that we saw with the no
streaming option between six and eight
cores shifted now between eight and ten
cores so if you're wanting to do some
heavy duty streaming maybe something
else in the background on top of gaming
then the Rison seven lineup would be
pretty sweet for you because it's only
gonna cost you around what an i7 would
normally and you do get eight cores plus
multi-threading support SMT and a MP's
case so you do have again plenty of lead
way for all that extra stuff you'd like
to do in the background without
compromising too much on the framerate
in your game now the next game I tested
was universe sandbox - I do have a
dedicated video on this very game and
how it leverages CPU horsepower you can
check it out in this card right here but
to keep things short and sweet it gets
especially intense in some scenarios I
try to run the earth and many moons
simulation every single time I benchmark
this and other videos just to keep
things consistent and when you're seeing
the screen recordings by the way the you
know I use shadowplay when I capture my
screen when you see those those aren't
the official benchmarks my benchmark all
my games without shadow play even
activated in the GeForce experience app
because I don't want that to affect my
results in the long run I want things to
be consistent again so I'm rerunning
this benchmark in a few scenarios so you
can actually see what's happening
physically on screen with the game now
even without streaming in the background
with universe sandbox 2 at 2 cores and 4
threads this game almost no maxed out
core usage we saw an average about 96
percent but several times throughout the
earth and many moons simulation the CPUs
all of them by the way all threads hit
100% utilization sometimes at the same
time which wasn't good you do the same
thing by the way in GTA 5 just not as
frequently now what I bumped the core
count to four so eight threads in total
this time we didn't see too big of a dip
in the utilization overall which I was
surprised by because what I've noticed
is when you have around eight cores when
I benchmarked this game with arisin
seven CPU let's say only about four of
the cores are heavily utilized the other
four just don't aren't really doing much
in the background frankly but I was
surprised to see all eight threads here
still working pretty heavily hence that
higher average this observation was
validated with the transition
I mean four and six scores we saw a huge
dip in the average CPU utilization from
ninety percent down to just 64 percent
pretty much in line with gta5 at this
point and this was a huge cut so what
this tells me is that it really cares
about four cores and if you have
multi-threading even better it's gonna
take advantage of that as well
but when you jump up to six cores you're
gonna have a significant drop in overall
CPU utilization you'll stop a few course
they're gonna be nearly maxed out and
that just comes with you know how the
game is optimized and then from then on
now you can see it was pretty level at
eight cores we saw 52% CPU average and
then look at that all the way over to 18
cores just 38% CPU utilization so it
really flatlines passed around 8 cores
so I would call this one fairly
significant
now this next trend is actually pretty
interesting I was expecting it not to
run at all I was expecting to have
issues streaming to YouTube it would be
really choppy right my bitrate I think
by the way was 5,000 which is pretty
high most people streaming around 3 or 4
K so about 5,000 kilobits per second is
a fairly significant figure especially
when it comes to streaming with a 2 core
processor and the game actually ran fine
it ran really well and for some reason
the CP utilization overall kept changing
so with the earth and manymoon
simulation I only had around 80 to 90
percent CP utilization you can see it
here but when I did other things in the
background like when I you know collided
stars seep utilization would still max
out at 100% and the framerate really
wouldn't dip to much I was actually
watching that too to see if we were
seeing a performance hit and I did
fairly well so despite seeing this 100%
utilization for two cores it's still
technically stable and the stream looks
stable too when I was running it through
my events panel if you bump it to four
cores we see the exact same utilization
we saw with 4 cores without streaming
which was interesting I don't really
know how to explain that technically the
CF utilization should be a bit higher
but maybe it's just off setting it right
and cutting the performance of the game
just a little bit so that you can
maintain that stream quality the trend
continues from 4 to 6 cores at 66% and
64 percent but then we finally see the
delta write that Delta shows up it's
usually about a 10% Delta and that's
what you should expect an average or
above-average stream to take advantage
of CPU is especially if you have a multi
multi core CPU
so about a 10% utilization Delta when
you had streaming on versus when you
didn't and when universe and box two
wasn't utilizing any more of those
threads available to it basically
Windows just assign those extra cores as
extra threads to the stream itself which
is why we didn't see a performance cut
past that when we were streaming it's
basically the you know the cliff where
you don't really see a difference past
that because you've already maxed out
your utilization in universe and box 2
so here's what I want you to take away
from this video and I'm gonna use an
analogy from Brian at Tech yeah city he
used this a while back in the livestream
of his and I and I thought it was pretty
clever you can only get so much power
out of a fork or CPU right you could
overclock it to 5 or 6 gigahertz on ln2
you're still only gonna get X
performance out of it now the higher
core count chips they're gonna be harder
to overclock at least across the board
and that's why frequency typically dips
as core count increases they're usually
inversely proportional but with that
said if you could find a way to
overclock an 18 core chip across all
cores to 5 or 6 gigahertz then he would
have just that much more power at your
disposal you can't do that the four core
chip unless you overclock that thing to
16 17 gigahertz in which case I'm good
and I could probably start a fire and
Bryant analogy was this it's the same
for a car engine right you can only get
so much power out of an inline 4 you're
limited by the displacement of your
engine that's what produces your torque
and your horsepower over all this you
know throw in something else like a
turbo or a supercharger and you're gonna
get more power from you in genetics
you're pulling more air into the engine
but that's kind of like your overclock
right you can only get so much air
through a certain size engine and when
you increase the engines displacement
and you increase the number of Pistons
and number cylinders in an engine then
you can increase your torque and
horsepower proportionally so that's kind
of what I want you guys to think about
when you think about CPU cores if you
want that extra breathing room that
ability to expand to do more things in
the background get the higher core count
chip as we saw in this video
anything past really 8 or 10 cores is
really gonna benefit you much at all
especially if you consider only gaming
so by this point in the video you might
be looking at me like Greg why don't you
waste your time explaining all of that
obvious stuff to me we all know that
anything past 6 or 8 cores is pretty
much worthless that's why we don't have
consumer grade chips past that I think
the real value in this video is in the
graphs because you can take those graphs
and kind of extrapolate them across
multiple modern CPUs with some
poor counts the reason why we don't have
anything higher than an eight-core
consumer grade chip right now is because
it doesn't make sense for the average
consumer it really doesn't gamers aren't
going to lies more than eight cores
unless they're running three games at
the same time on the same machine or
you're running virtual machines or you
know you're doing something crazy like
that same goes for content creators I
would say the content creators don't
need thread Ripper they don't need
extreme CPUs from Intel they really
don't and Adobe Premiere Pro for example
doesn't utilize more than about six
cores efficiently and that's that's just
how it is
so these CPUs are meant for totally
different tasks but you can at least see
how gaming and streaming a particular
interact with the extra cores at their
disposal if you like this video let me
know by giving this one a thumbs up I
appreciate it thumbs down for the
opposite or if you hate everything about
