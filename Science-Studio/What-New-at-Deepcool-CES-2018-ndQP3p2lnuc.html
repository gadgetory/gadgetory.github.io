phone in my hand because we're in the
deep cool suite here at Caesar's Palace
seems like all of our meetings are in
Caesar's Palace here in Vegas for CES
2018 and I want to start things off by
showing you guys a quad stellar
rendition here this is the electro
limited edition version of this case
you'll see another electro limited
edition case here shortly but I want to
start with this one because it's got
pretty cool features things I didn't
know about this case that it's
definitely packing and doing very well
let's start things off by clicking that
I don't know exactly what the order of
things is here but I just click the
custom button and they're built in quad
stellar app and there you go it's kind
of like Ryan's like a Lamborghini and
like the vents open up when the engine
needs more air it's kind of like a
version of that and this actually is is
built this way for the same purpose so
you can actually manually open these up
via the quad stellar app to give your
computer more air if it's so desires and
the way you can set things up in here
it's allow more air to be pulled in
through the front of the case to cool
off up to three graphics cards that's
right three graphics cards in here full
size and even extended ATX motherboards
and up to nine hard disk drives and SSDs
this case really has it all power
supplies go down at the bottom and the
special edition here the limited edition
electro version comes with these nice
mirrors that give it like a very classy
feel and orange accents on the inside I
think we'll wants one of these because
you can definitely build himself an ass
in here get yourself a mining we're
going in on this side and then geez
don't even know what this is think you
can get lost in here now if you remember
from our Computex 2017 coverage we kind
of hinted at a case they had displayed
that wasn't available yet in fact they
had it planned to be released much later
in 2018 well this is it with several
revisions and they've actually added
some really cool features to the
exterior the case that we want to
highlight here so this is called the new
arc and 90 this is in particular the
electro limited edition version so again
with the orange accents on one side we
also have the mirrored panels which are
typically tempered glass so starting
with that exterior the first thing
you'll probably notice is this very
large reservoir that spans the entire
height of the case it's really cool
because it's not completely filled up
which is actually
okay you can see the fluid moving all
the way down you can see we have a
little fluid meter down here at the
bottom with the game or storm logo also
RGB accents going all the way down look
really nice against this mirrored finish
and the orange background which I'm
actually okay with orange is looking
pretty sweet here next to the mirror now
swinging around to the inside like first
point out there is an integrated a IO
here as there are with most gamer storm
cases which I'm actually a pretty big
fan of I love this CPU block I've always
loved the captain 240 X's 360 X's now
with RGB support and here the one we
have integrated it actually a 280
millimeter version so the radiators
recessed behind this this fan chassis
and then we have the game or storm fans
in front and you can see we have three
140 s going all the way down not enough
for a 420 ml radiator but you don't need
that because the a IO is already
included you can also mount three looks
like 120mm fans up front and up top so
air flow is definitely a priority for
this case I have no problem with that
that's great
also a vertical graphics card mounting
support and if you swing around back
here you'll see that this case is the
first of only 100 so all the electro
limited edition cases are exclusive you
have just a hundred of them available
and this is the very first one so you'll
find this case supports EE ATX
motherboards also a cool thing rubber
grommet 'add cutouts going all the way
around so this is probably the most I've
ever seen in a case which is actually
really good for those who want to
prioritize cable management keep things
nice and hidden from view we have three
rubber grommets on the bottom good for
HD audio you can run some fans here run
your front I Oh connectors through this
one maybe we have three rubber grommets
on the side going up so one good for
SATA one for pound or whatever else you
really want and then probably a 24-pin
running through either of these and then
if we get really low and look up here we
have two more rubber grommet two cutouts
up top good for your 810 EPS cable and I
don't know more fan connections or RGB
LED strips I mean the whole point is
this is a very versatile case when it
comes to that because you have so many
here you can keep things hidden from
view so if you're worried about where
the air is actually going with that kind
of like I don't how I would describe
it's like it's turn
degrees right the radiator and the fans
what's blowing toward the right side
panel the case well instead of just
throwing in like a regular ol mesh
design here which what most Bank case
manufacturers do deep cool have decided
to they've like pushed like they got
like little triangles going on here and
they have plenty of airflow slits so I'm
actually I can feel air just you know
effortlessly move making its way out of
this right side panel and I love this
design it definitely mister spices
things up a bit more so you really feel
like you're getting what you paid for
another thing you might remember from
Computex coverage last year nico
actually had their entire like they had
this huge like dual board looking thing
and they had deep cool spouts out there
with their MF 120 fans so they've
actually improved them and they're
making these available so the ROG bees
that are inside here are beautifully
dispersed they're they're diffused very
well so you can't see individual LEDs
which is really nice and they have
actually improved the functionality them
to the point where you can literally
like you can customize these to such a
great extent with the app that you can
connect to these fans via Wi-Fi so I'm
just gonna kind of show you some of them
that are built in here so breathing mode
obviously which is what set - you can
also change the color from a dedicated
color tabs let's keep them on green for
a second we have breathing mode we have
flash mode multicolor meteor mode and
then multi color flowing all that
control from this hub which again
connects to Wi-Fi and to the app on your
phone dedicated app for the MF 120 s and
a dedicated app for the quad stellar
case if you want both for whatever
reason I don't blame you then you'd have
two apps and you can control everything
via your phone which is really cool so
you don't have to open your case every
time you want to change the color scheme
or change the the pattern the way that
the lights interact with the rest of the
case now this thing right here is called
the frozen it is a six heat pipe cooler
specifically designed for the red Ripper
so the tr4 socket now this is a full
surface area cooler meaning that the
cooler itself the the contact that the
cooler makes with the CPU covers the IHS
of thread Ripper CPUs completely which
is ideal when it comes to to cooling the
CPU extracting as much the heat
generated from the CPU as you can to
disperse it into the fins and then have
this fan push that heat out of your
case so we also we have RGB support on
the side here with the the the fan
actually looks like it's designed with
the cooler in mind so it's like a custom
fan for this air cooler and then up top
we also have the game or storm logo
eliminated with the same RGB scheme
alright and another thing I want to show
off here this is a captain 240 X RGB
it's specifically designed again for the
tr4 platform so for thread Ripper we
have the mounting supports for that
again it just it's it follows the same
standard captain 240 X design which I
love I'm glad they didn't deviate from
that and we also have because this is
the Electra limited edition AIO the
orange sleeves going down to the block
and also orange accented gamer storm
fans these of course are multi bladed so
they're actually gonna do a great job at
dispersing air through the radiator and
it's also at a bunch of really nice it's
like a nice silver like brushed finish
which I'm a big fan of actually and it
looks great when you throw it into
something like this although you
probably won't see it this follows that
traditional orange and gray color scheme
with the electro limited edition series
so with that I hope that you've enjoyed
the stuff that people has to offer right
now I'm looking forward to possibly
getting our hands on maybe not the
limited edition one because it is hard
to come by right only 100 pieces but but
at least a quad stellar case because
I've actually been pretty impressed by
the support this case has and just by
how ostentatious it is overall maybe you
will control this build so with that we
hope you've liked the video thanks for
deep cool for sending us to Vegas for
CES 2018 we'll catch in the next one
this is science studio thanks for
touring with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
