in the mail today and this box right
here is a gtx 1080i from xlr8 i will
admit in the past that brand which is
kind of like p and wise gaming division
has struggled with their cards looks you
expect them to look about as powerful as
they are right 1060 s look decent 1070 s
look even better in 1080 s
top-of-the-line look absolutely do but
on the wide scales like that but it does
so I decided to do an unboxing slash
first impression segment in the
beginning of this video to validate
accelerates claims that this is their
best card to date in terms of looks also
in terms of performance it is a 1080i
after all let's unbox this thing and see
if what they told me is true or not and
yes we are wondering this is an i3 73 50
K yes it is also my box opener it's a
stupid processor should be used for
nothing other than to open boxes here is
the card GTX 1080 Ti the i3 73 50 K also
works as an excellent plastic and
wrapper can't confirm okay are we ready
for this the moment of truth just how
good does this card look it's really all
about looks at this point we all know
how powerful GTX 1080s are I just want
to see how good Wow Wow
that is incredibly small which is super
cool Wow I cannot get over how tiny
discards it's so small which is super
cool because most attended UTIs are
extremely thick at least with these
aftermarket coolers on them they're
usually two-and-a-half slot cars and
they're super stick you know they extend
out past the PCIe slot quite a ways but
this card is it's literally it fits the
form factor of the PCB perfectly saved a
little extension it hangs over just a
bit more which is perfectly fine for
cooling purposes
now look by this point we all know how
powerful GTX 1080p is are the accelerate
version brings nothing unique to the
table in that respect what I do want to
do is differentiate some of the
qualities that blower style cards have
these cards get rid of one of those
obviously is sound the other is actually
frequency within videos new dynamic
frequency controller that's just built
into these cards you'll find that as
temperatures approach
80 85 degrees Celsius blower style cards
those frequencies those core frequencies
and even memory in some very rare cases
will be adjusted accordingly meaning
that it will drop those frequencies just
ever so slightly to keep those
temperatures in check from exceeding a
certain limit so 85 degrees Celsius was
the barrier for the PNY 1080i this card
didn't even get close to 80 85 degrees
Celsius back to stayed below 70 degrees
Celsius while running Unigine super
position benchmark so apart from the
extreme difference in sound the
difference right here
we also have to account for the
frequency fluctuation found in the P&amp;amp;Y
blower style card it's unique to blower
style cards for the most part unless you
plan on overclocking you'll find that if
you do overclock the accelerate version
which you could probably get a few maybe
a hundred megahertz or so out of it if
you wanted to overclock it is a
reference PCB those would keep that in
mind you're not gonna have that extra
power needed to perhaps overclock to
around two thousand or twenty one
hundred megahertz you still might find
those temperature's rising past that
threshold at a certain point and in
which case you would notice that
frequency being adjusted ever so
slightly so we saw that the PNY card was
around eighteen eighteen fifty megahertz
and then that dropped to a little below
eighteen hundred megahertz when the
temperature approached eighty five
degrees celsius again none of that
occurred on the accelerate version which
is great news for anyone who just wants
to pull the card out of the box plug it
in and never have to worry about it
again now I do want to say a few more
things regarding accelerates design
choice for their 1080p I make no secret
of my opinion in this case I think this
card is one of the best looking cards
ever produced period and I was not paid
to say that I wasn't persuaded to say
that I received another ten atti from
PNY and I thought it looked ok I didn't
think it looked excellent it just had an
old-school vibe to it
some people were for some people weren't
but in this case it just it looks like
the future and it looks compact it looks
quiet and that's exactly what this card
brings to the table I'm a huge fan of
the metal sheen on top I love how it's
not too colorful it's got subtle hints
of red in it which is cool but if you
don't like the red no worries unless
you're just opposing a card upright you
won't see the red at all it's just black
and silver which means that it'll match
pretty much anything in your PC so no
worries about color coordination in this
case another thing I should mention
there are no LEDs in this card
whatsoever none of the fans none in
front where the gtx logo is there aren't
any period and I actually am ok with
this you know there are so many RGB LED
cards out there even just cards that
have white accent LEDs I'm just kind of
sick and tired of at this point you know
I look at cards like these and I'm like
ok well if I wanted to light up I can
just put an LED strip in my case apart
from that though the card itself is just
going to do what it needs to do and
that's about it I don't need it to light
up I don't need it to to be you know
seeing from 10 miles away
this card is subtle but it's powerful
and
that's your vibe this is the card for
you now the last thing I did was take
this card apart I wanted to see what was
on the inside other than what I could
see through the fans here I wanted to
see how they were cooling the VRMs how
they were cooling the vram all of that
was just I was kind of the back of my
mind I was like okay well they're
getting great temperatures let's see why
especially considering how thin this
card actually is I was pleasantly
surprised to find dedicated heat sinks
where they should be as well as thermal
pads lining the perimeter of the GPU
this is where your vram exists so this
card was built well it was built to last
it was also built to keep things
extremely cool if you ask me this is one
of the best-looking gtx ten ATT eyes
money can buy but it will not be the
best overclocker which means that it
will not be the best performer so while
you might not scrape out those extra 5
to 10 FPS in games granted you'll
probably be gaming in well over 100 FPS
anyway this is still a great car to
consider as always you can find it
