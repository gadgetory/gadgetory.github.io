ways it's an evolve on the interior with
a p-series exterior and I'm perfectly
satisfied with that especially
considering the $50 price markdown for
this model at one point the P 400 was my
favorite mid tower case competitions
become a pretty clear size of late but
fantex has done an incredible job
revamping the P series flagship with a
modestly over engineered and sexy
release sporting yeah nylon are you in
dire need of yeah an upgrade look no
further than power colors red dragon
Vega 56 at only 319 dollars from March
8th to the 11th and 3 epic games
included you're getting one heck of a
bargain purchase now via the link below
seeing as though this case in terms of
function nearly matches the evolve ex we
reviewed in this video right here I'll
spend the bulk of this video testing
fantex claims regarding the nylon
paneling up front and on top but we'll
do a quick run through a support for
those who are new to the fan tech scene
this is a 7 slot 3 vertical slot mid
tower with support for up to eight 360
millimeter fan rad combo both up top and
up front you can throw a single 120 or
140 on the rear as well you'll find 3
140 mm fantex branded fans included with
the p6 under desks they do a great job
staying quiet surprisingly under load
and yeah I wouldn't really have a
problem using these for a high-end build
with the case you'll find a large
accessory box with for modular hard
drive trays zip ties that you probably
won't even need and a case full of
necessary screws I actually suggest
saving this it's really cool that fantex
even includes one to begin with and then
you can sort by screw size and thread
for future builds it's very similar to
something I use daily and it definitely
comes in handy support for up to ATX
motherboards is present since the
motherboard tray is indented toward the
front for extra cable management
Headroom you won't be able to stuff
anything larger in here in terms of
motherboard compatibility the cable
sliders are probably my least favorite
aspect of this case if I'm being honest
I talk to this a bit my evolve X review
I just feel as though they're over in
near essentially trying to reinvent the
wheel in my opinion the rubber grommets
in this case I think would have been
just a much easier thing to implement
and then would have been just
functionally easier to work around in
this case my 24-pin was sitting
awkwardly and there really wasn't much
else I can do about it so yeah elsewhere
however things look pretty great there's
a dedicated PCIe cable cutout in the
basement which you can't open or close
with this plastic cover large cutouts
under the motherboard tray allowing for
routing things like HD audio front i/o
and USB 2.0 cables whatever really want
down here up top a large opening
provides ample space for any extra fan
cables and things like your a pen DPS
fantex conveniently list clearance
metrics on their website by the way I'll
go ahead and read through a couple the
CPU cooler metric is for the height of
CPU cooler up to 190 millimeters and
graphics cards up to 435 millimeters
long
will fit in the p6 under this you'll
find this is a rather large mid Tower
but I think it works here because
there's just so much going on inside
there's there's really no empty space
even without a custom loop so on the
back we've got our 120 or 140 ml fan
mount rear i/o cutout seven plus three
PCI slots and a PSU cutout with included
bracket just attach it to your power
supply slide it through the back and
it's secured to the chassis with two
captive thumb screws a small removable
dust filters included underneath by the
way you'll find plenty of space under
the basement for even extended power
supplies especially if you don't plan to
attach the three and a half inch base in
fact even if you were using a bv power
supply with cable extensions you know
including the traditional cable length
I highly doubt you'd find yourself
running out of room and this speaks to
the sheer volume allotted to the right
portion of the P 600 s there's so much
space on the side for cable management
and storage it really is a beautiful
thing you even get tons of velcro straps
included they're kind of integrated into
the case so I highly doubt you'll need
the zip ties it through and see why I
said that I still nice to have though
like everything back here is so
simplistic in a way despite looking
fairly busy with all the cables tucked
in and running around a magnetic right
panel on the case which we'll talk more
about a second closes with literally one
finger and that's how much space we've
got on this side so yeah
cable management on this one is
definitely
a 10 out of 10 now let's talk about
these panels both the left and right
panels are hinged and can swing open
slightly past 180 degrees I tried
removing mine but yeah unless they were
super glued down they they weren't
coming off I don't know I don't know if
they're supposed to be removable like
they were on the evolve X but at least
this sample here I could not get them
off fellas and I'll break the case so I
just left them as this the good thing is
because it swings open past 180 like
it's really versatile you can kind of
make space where you need it the
tempered glass on the Left panel is
lined with damping material to seal the
internals and trap sound it's also only
slightly tinted which actually looks
really great on this white model as for
the right panel
we've got no tempered glass which I'm
fine with but instead we've been welcome
to sound damping pads and the same trim
around the edges to properly seal off
the build and look apart from the
magnets baked into the two doors there's
really nothing else holding these things
in place now the evolved X if I'm not
mistaken included optional little thumb
screw points to keep the doors closed
during transport like if we assume the
magnets fail made they weren't holding
any more it prevented those doors from
swinging open but I'm not saying that in
the piece under desks so fantex must be
pretty confident about the strength and
durability of these magnets there are
four inside each door the top of the
case is rather bare sporting only a
white glowing power button and a
removable panel that either suppresses
sound when equipped or allows the case
to breathe a bit more when removed its
insides are covered with the same
damping material found on the right
panel and is also held in place with a
few magnets the front of the chassis is
what I'd like to focus on last because
we'll manipulate the heck out of it
during our temperature and airflow test
so unlike more traditional mid towers in
its price category the p600 ass includes
modular front and top panels and tend to
either keep things quiet or cool and
those panels will sit in place of what
you would normally see beneath them
which is nylon and then I'm behind the
nylon a very thin metal mesh which
essentially acts as a dust filter so
what I really want to talk about is this
nylon because it is something that I've
never seen before on a pc case at all
and
think it does a great job at allowing
her to pass through it unhindered so
you'll see that here in a second but I
do want to say that we saw this in
earlier stages at Computex fantex kind
of wanted to play around with it see if
they could actually turn this into a
full-scale production and implemented
into cases and here they aren't doing
that it's pretty awesome they were
claiming three times the airflow of
conventional mesh filtering wasn't
totally on board with that until I ran
our stress test and I'll say this the P
600's has the best air flow of any case
I've ever tested and the config that we
tested it in I can't say it's the best
on the market but I mean it's pretty
incredible
so the Nilan essentially kills two birds
with one stone it filters larger dust
particles and hair while occupying a
significantly smaller area meaning air
should be less impeded when pulled by
the front fans it doesn't comprise a
single sheet or layer of the same way
that like a metal filter would it
actually does look like it's into roben
twice so you have two nylon layers
stretched to spec without the use of
glue or anything that could potentially
break down with time which is nice you
can clean this stuff pretty easy and
even potentially replace it with other
colors in the future so we'll see what
fantex decides to do in the coming
months if you could swap this with like
a white mesh filter I think that'd be
really cool what I will say is that the
use of this stuff is brilliant so here
are our temperature results compared to
our be quiet dark Bay 700 which had
integrated filters and a rather closed
off front panel CPU temperatures for the
P 600 s were about 3.5 degrees Celsius
lower but that wasn't the coolest part
when we removed the front panel and a
mini mesh filter underneath core temps
dropped to sixty seven point two degrees
still a degree lower than our dart by
700 likely due to the inclusion of
additional fan pointed at the CPU cooler
we still aren't at the coolest part here
are the CPU temps with only either the
mesh filter or nylon panel install I
reran these tests three times each to
confirm that the nylon was actually less
restrictive than the mesh which is I
mean this is a very thin mesh here
probably some of the most permeable mesh
I've seen and only resulted in a point
three degrees Celsius bump over our run
without a panel installed at all
something else to note our graphics card
temps literally went unchanged
throughout these tests in the
conventional position ample airflow is
supplied however we did not test the
card in a vertical config I mean it be
pressed literally against the left last
panel effectively choking in a bear you
guys know it's not an optimal position
you could run it there if you want but
it's gonna run a lot hotter and probably
louder especially considering the fact
that it's only like that far from the
glass so I really only recommend these
kinds of slots for custom water coolers
with graphics card water blocks on a
closed loop otherwise you'll want to use
the vertical kit from either cable mod
or Coolermaster ever viewed both you'll
see in pop up here in a second so back
to the temps and this is where we'll
wrap up the video the nylon is
incredibly porous I haven't been able to
test this for a week it's like a
standalone filter to see how much dust
it actually allows into the case maybe a
separate video for that but even if you
were to still sport the mesh filter
underneath it which is basically the
panel on scenario you'll only see a tiny
bump in temperatures in our case that
bump was as small as 1.5 degrees if we
stress both our CPU and GPU to the point
where they're you know being utilized a
hundred percent each those margins would
probably spread a bit you know that card
would run at the heart of the seafood
probably run closer to 80 85 degrees
Celsius but one thing's for sure I'd be
much more comfortable you know maxing
out both my CPU and GPU workloads in a
case like this which allows these or to
define his or her airflow preference if
things are getting a little too hot just
remove the two covers so the one on top
and the one up front and you'll be good
to go I mean literally this is as good
as removing the panel entirely and then
give or take half a degree Celsius
now the nylon still looks good air flow
properties are fantastic the sound you
know the stock fans produce is hardly
detectable so I would argue that you
don't even really need the covers I mean
the covers are nice like if you want
just like a bear front and top panel
that's cool and you do have that sound
damping material which does in fact
reduce the overall audible tones
produced by the system but I I mean if
this was my bill then I was just gonna
support this for a month or two I would
totally remove these and never use them
because I think the nylon looks good
enough on its own it doesn't look
terrible I think it'd be really cool if
we could you get the white mesh but the
the white nylon with the white chassis
that'd be really cool the black is a
nice contrast
but it might not be in everyone's taste
that said though it still looks really
good so I would not have a problem at
all and I said I would actually prefer
to run the Nile on exposed rather than
covering it up and then letting my
system run hotter as a result back to
the fans for a second just for some
reference look they aren't as good as
the ones be quiet includes in their dark
bass 700 sound links three are some of
the best fans out there but you get
three here instead of two that'd be
quite includes which makes up for the
difference and arguably extra so look if
you're if you're looking to spend let's
say over a hundred bucks between 100 to
$200 on a mid tower case this is a
serious contender aesthetically I don't
think it's as sexy as something like the
PC 11 dynamic which i think is still
probably my favorite case but the
function of the p 600's is undeniable
I'd like to see the same nylon
implementation in smaller cases from fan
texts like maybe the P 300 to the P 350
X I'd like those price points then we'd
be talking and I think the P 350 acts is
still the best priced case one of the
best price the the H 500 forum is XT is
still a really good price case as well
but if we get that mesh and the P
through the X or something similar to
that for around 60 70 bucks oh that's
gonna be it that to me that will
dominate that entire price category
it'll be better than the mesh if I see
it'll be better than the H 500 just
because it'll still look really good and
prioritize airflow at the same time it's
hard to get both today's day and age let
me know what you guys think in the
