better with this budget comment I'm well
aware that many of you originally
subscribed to this channel on account of
our budget oriented PC coverage not
everyone aspires for the biggest and
best out there and in light of my custom
loop build happening this week by the
way I decided to build something much
more sensible and reasonable the
computers will cost only about 4
Benjamins that's 400 US dollars
I like to say upfront however that the
two most expensive components in this
build are the CPU cooler and the case
both of which can be easily trimmed down
bringing the price to around 300 u.s.
dollars if you play your cards right at
the core of this build is an AMD FX 6300
which I got from a friend for a whopping
30 bucks I don't recommend purchasing a
new FX processor was then releasing in
March but if you can find one with a
steep discount for a budget build handy
downs are always the best for these
kinds of pcs don't let the offer slip
away the processor still holds its own
and gaming following between the
performance of an Intel i3 and an Intel
Pentium more on that right here as for
the motherboard I purchased this Asus
micro ATX am three board from micro
Center for 15 US dollars you can find
some epic deals if you're willing to
make the trip to a store like NC I drove
three and a half hours to the one in
Houston for this budget beauty and I do
it all over again in a heartbeat it
isn't the prettiest or most functional
but it's a heck of a steal considering
it still technically brand-new next up
eight gigabytes of Crucial Ballistix
sport ddr3 for $30.00 kind of strange
that system Ram here cost as much as a
CPU you could probably find a cheap or
used kit on eBay or elsewhere if you're
willing to be patient
local craigslist ads are also great
sources of used PC components provided
they work as advertised
next up the graphics card I was tempted
to go full on our X 480 here but decided
to step back a generation to keep the
price down I've also already tested that
combo right here the CPU proved to be a
massive bottleneck in comes the r9 380 I
revealed a few videos go regardless
however our FX 6300 will be holding us
back in quite a few 1080p titles so the
power supply I went with a 600 watt EVGA
80-plus PSU that I found it best by
forget this 29.95 not bad for a brand
new unit and 600 watts at that it might
not be a top tier you
but it will do just fine in this rig
I've actually used a few of these exact
power supplies in the past without
issues they're quiet cheap and reliable
I speak from experience for storage
nothing fancy here just a one terabyte
Toshiba hard disk drive that I pulled
from the pre-built CyberPower PC you can
find one terabyte drive to use and new
from anywhere between 20 and 40 US
dollars safely the Seagate drive is 30
bucks so that's what I'll use in the
price breakdown they'll provide plenty
of storage for games movies and other
system files feel free though to add in
an SSD for Windows if you're up for
throwing in an extra forty bucks now for
the last two pieces of the puzzle the
ones you can hot-swap without affecting
performance much at all I say that
because overclocked ability on this
motherboard is restrictive being that it
isn't 990 FX and the power deliver
ability is relatively low I did this
more or less because I could that's it
there's no other explanation for it I
managed to fit a be quiet dark Rock pro
3 a massive CPU air cooler into a
fractal design to find mini C absolutely
epic but this is of course where the
budget sort of balloons flop these two
with a $40 case in a hyper 212 evo for
instance and you've got yourself a 300
ish dollar gaming PC what I wanted to
try out this case and I quickly
discovered that I am in love with it
it's probably the most enjoyable case to
build in that I've ever built in micro
ATX is a beautiful and dying breed but
I'm glad fractal hasn't forgotten
I love the basement soundproof panels
wide stance cable management Headroom
and overall build quality my only
complaint no cutouts for VGA cable
routing that's really it everything else
was top-notch so this is what it's come
down to about 400 bucks for an FX 6300
r9 380 combo in a beautiful case with an
epic CPU cooler again probably want to
scratch that one stock cooler sounds
hideous that it would keep the price
much lower to 300 bucks and something
like a hyper t4 is going to set you back
about $20 I was still however able to
reach 4.6 gigahertz on the FX 6300
anything above that and a computer would
refuse to boot but what does this price
tag earn you well in GTA 5 about 51 FPS
on the latest AMD drivers low stayed
well above 30 even with high settings
across the board which are three nearly
suffocated the graphics card
the same preset though our average only
touched 45 FPS here but dropping
settings just a bit further picked up
the slack battlefield one seemed to
manage just fine with this combination
63 FPS on high settings in 1080p and
raising this resolution to 1440p it is
because I was curious only resulted in
an 8 FPS dip in both the minimum and
average lastly if you're into some
casual racing Microsoft's 4 to 6 apex
will not disappoint this game could
practically run on anything relatively
modern without a hitch gameplay will be
smooth and consistent here no questions
asked so there you have it
even for around three hundred US dollars
you could build a relatively decent
1080p gaming machine capable of handling
modern triple-a titles sure you could
probably do better on them there's
always someone who can find something
for super cheap from either a buddy or
someone on Craigslist old Zeon's are
also a great option but I still think a
6-quart unlocked CPU is a great buy for
30 bucks not to mention a and three
boards are downright cheap compared to
their LGA counterparts if you liked this
