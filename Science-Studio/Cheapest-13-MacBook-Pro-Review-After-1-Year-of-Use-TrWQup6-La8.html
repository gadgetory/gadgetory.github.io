Mouse sale with Rockette for one week
beginning May 25th
my recommendation is the cone IMO
sporting a whopping 12,000 dpi option
which I doubt anyone will actually use
with the ally sensor well renowned and
german-engineered in case an independent
RGB zones and wrapped at the wire and a
durable braid the cone IMO will be sure
to thank you a one click at a time catch
this week-long mass drop sale via the
link in this video's description you
know there's a long history of hate
between diehard Apple fans and computer
building enthusiasts like ourselves you
see we take pride in the fact that we
can customize we have the freedom to
choose components and upgrade freely we
aren't bound by proprietary hardware and
restricted designs we can fix things
without worry and we don't typically pay
premiums but Apple on the other hand is
the exact opposite of a product breaks
you're almost forced to stay within the
ecosystem that's ecosystem that the bad
side of the ecosystem take it to a
genius assuming you live next to an
Apple Store or ship it directly to Apple
HQ where you'll pay in excess of a
hundred USD just to fix a screen you can
buy off eBay for 30 bucks and back it's
gonna cost a lot more than a hundred
bucks to fix any of the newer screens
out there especially the iPhone 10
screen look repairing these products
yourself is usually within the realm of
possibility but hours of intense labor
are almost certainly required ask Linus
how that's going
so Apple products boast proprietary
screws proprietary drives proprietary
software and to make things worse
premium prices so unless you're
literally made of money or have parents
literally made of money your tendency is
to choose a cheaper alternative it just
makes more sense for the person who's a
bit more budget conscious at least you
would think because Apple is actually
doing really well right now they're
dominating a solid chunk of the mobile
tech market despite the lukewarm iPhone
10 sales closing 2017 there's still the
second largest smartphone manufacturer
if I total market share and they started
with just one phone what like 10 or so
years ago so limited to only a few
models per cycle the company still
trades blows with corporate giants like
Samsung which mind you offer a plethora
of smartphones ranging from cheap $50
invitations to the flagship s9 and
Samsung's case so it makes sense that
they have a huge grip on the market
moreover Apple's
market share hit double digits beginning
in 2018 surpassing lifelong competitor a
sues for the fourth-largest notebook
manufacturer on the planet those three
still above Dell Lenovo and HP with the
crown at least for now
I've personally dabbled in multiple
company product lines over the years the
Dell XPS 13 was an excellent Ultrabook
save the coil line discussed in this
video here and the Lenovo yoga 9 10
surprised me with its premium hinge and
glass construction it really was a
well-made laptop I had a lead a few
cheaper variants as well from companies
like a soos and HP but my favorite
Ultrabook by far has to be the 13-inch
MacBook Pro and I know you're thinking
are you serious Greg and this is
actually the cheapest model you could
possibly buy from the 13-inch MacBook
lineup but it's still my favorite laptop
to date and here's why so this very
basic MacBook Pro is in fact the
cheapest you could possibly buy sporting
a 7 gen Intel Core i5 ultra-low power
processor with a base frequency of 2.3
gigahertz a single core will
occasionally turbo up to 3.6 gigahertz
under especially intense single-threaded
workloads though I should point out that
this is very rare and if it does happen
it will almost immediately thermal
throttle packing only 8 gigs of
low-power ddr3 is a letdown but it's
enough for most of what I do in Mac OS
it's a pretty lightweight operating
system to begin with an important note
though regarding the 13 inch MacBook
Pros is that 8 gigabytes as of May 2018
is the maximum amount of RAM that this
model boasts any 13-inch MacBook will
not go higher than 8 gigs and because
it's soldered on you're kind of screwed
you can't update or you know add
additional RAM modules to the board if
the chips are actually you know soldered
into the motherboard the screen is a
beautiful 2560 by 1600 IPS retina panel
for approximately 227 PPI with decent
color accuracy it's a little low by
today's standards but it's enough to get
the point across and at 500 nits it's
extremely bright assume you are too
concerned with battery life you'll have
a very beautiful looking display the
slightly stretched aspect ratio though
will result in small black bars on top
and on the bottom of your screen when
viewing fullscreen videos the panel
though has surprisingly good contrast
ratios despite not being AMOLED more on
the differences between various screen
technologies in
or right here the speakers in these
laptops are next to none producing solid
actually detectable low tones and
remaining clear all the way up to max
volume
they're loud clear as crystal which is
kind of a weird way to say it crystal
clear and hidden behind mostly cosmetic
front grilles the microphones are in
here as well
battery life is also incredible I'm
easily hitting six to eight hours on
heavy use and that's my version of heavy
use which is pretty dense you know a
Skype call for example will push this
thing down to maybe six hours which is
still really good that's using the video
camera and if you're just doing some
lightweight web browsing or typing up
documents easily eight to ten hours easy
and the quick charge capabilities of the
included power brick and thunderbolt
three ports only two on one side for the
base model I should say take the edge
off when working with heavy files and
CPU intensive programs because it
charges so quick you won't be bound to
the cable all the time even under those
intense workloads it's a win-win either
way in my book and speaking of wins all
these MacBook Pro Sport PCIe based SSD
starting as low as 128 gigs available in
the base model which I have here and
despite the storage space issues I
frequently experience because 128 gigs
is nowhere near enough for me the drive
speeds are actually excellent and this
tends to scale according to the drive
size right the bigger the drive the
faster the drive usually is but with
these MacBooks even the the cheapest SSD
that is PCIe based is lightning fast
this was certainly an area in which they
could have cheaped out but they didn't
that's surprising for Apple and the
build quality is another thing but we
expect a decent build quality at least
now be baked in iris plus 640 graphics
aren't sufficient for gaming really of
any kind even though they touted it is
like a huge improvement over the
standard I think it was Intel graphics
620 yeah there's not much of a
difference there at all don't buy this
thing expecting to game in any sense of
the word
I mean maybe minecraft and like
ultralight dota or leek but that's about
it now you can connect a portable
discrete graphics box to this laptop
something like the Razer core and a few
companies claim to support MacBooks
natively but I don't recommend such a
combination until I see it fully
functioning with my own eyes these
MacBooks always have issues with those
kinds of little gaming boxes so stay
tuned now what people seem to really
hate about these MacBooks is the
keyboard I didn't like it too much on
the 12-inch MacBook but the second
version of these butterfly switches
which are in the MacBook Pros are
surprisingly tactile despite the minimal
key travel it's a
comfortable keyboard on which to type
documents I'm pretty used to it any
other altra book feels mushy right those
keys have a lot of key travel but they
don't feel very clicky not like
mechanical switches
I actually prefer you know minimal key
travel with tactile feedback and that's
what these butterfly switches offer it's
a comfortable keyboard on which to type
I would normally recommend it but
there's a big problem with especially
the spacebar that you should be aware of
before buying one of these especially
secondhand and to be fair it isn't just
limited to the bar reports of other keys
completely crapping out have been cited
online including the Alt key Enter key
keys you would hit periodically in my
case something became lodged under the
space key so after fully removing it
part of the key stop actuated meaning it
wasn't being registered by the operating
system so the corners became
unresponsive which that's usually what I
hit write the corners of the space for
not the center and I had to completely
take it apart to address the issue I
don't recommend doing this unless
absolutely necessary by the way because
there are tiny spacers and plastic
grooves that can easily snap rendering
the entire key useless and without a
space key your whole keyboard is
basically done for at which point you
got to ship it back to Apple there of
course gonna make you pay tons of
dollars to get that thing fixed and
you're gonna have a really bad time in
short Apple really messed up here my
opinions of this keyboard quickly
changed once this issue came to light on
my personal device this is not something
I mentioned in my original MacBook
13-inch review by the way another
absolutely ridiculous and inexcusable
trait of a 13-inch MacBook the camera
it's garbage planning simple Apple
claims it's like a 720p capable camera
but all videos are gonna look like trash
and basically VGA it's so bad I'm almost
embarrassed to make calls with it just
because it's so grainy it's terrible in
anything other than super bright ambient
light and the microphone to be honest
isn't that great either it is it's a
little too aggressive with the
background noise suppression and I think
that has to do with where exactly the
microphones are placed in the laptop
this is a test of the MacBook Pros video
quality I will say audio is on point
pretty good for a 13-inch MacBook but
the picture quality is subpar and that's
kind of been the trend with Apple's
smaller laptops recently even the
12-inch MacBook stuff are the same issue
is this mediocre video Paul you expect
better from Apple especially when you're
paying this much
or laptop on a device costing well over
$1,000 this game it seriously needs to
be stepped up I mean come on a pro
laptop with a crap camera like this is
unacceptable okay
now by this point if you're still
wondering why I chose to use the 13-inch
base MacBook Pro over all the other
models I've ever had on hand including
the top-tier i7s with 16 gigs of ram 512
gigs of storage and just as good if not
better at displays here's why if you've
seen my past MacBook Pro videos the
answer really hasn't changed video
editing is a dream on this machine with
their proprietary applications and to
prove the point I went out and purchased
the cheapest MacBook Pro I could only
eight gigs of RAM the base Core i5 and a
hefty screen resolution to drive this
laptop still yields beautiful photo and
video renders thanks to again that
pinpointed optimization with these
proprietary applications Final Cut Pro
and even iMovie are prime examples of
this and I movies free so what you just
want to make the point exporting a
five-minute 4k video file takes less
than 10 minutes
that is insane for a ULP based MacBook
it blows away the Adobe Premiere Pro
competition on the exact same device
these are different encoding formats
sure but compression differences between
the two are near non-existent and if I
try to match up the encoding formats as
closely as possible Final Cut Pro and
iMovie still destroy the competition
Final Cut in particular seamlessly
renders in the background while editing
and that's a stringent hardware
acceleration technique related to quick
sync and I GPS for the added push and
that's why I roll with this thing
anywhere I go for business I'm taking it
with me to Taiwan for copy text again
next month for that very reason I love
editing on it
I love the screens color reproduction I
love the speakers I love the endurance
of the battery I love the thin profile
and to be completely honest Mac OS isn't
all that bad it's kind of growing on ya
it's not you know enough for me to want
to replace Windows 10 outright gaming is
still terrible on OS 10 but I'm still
more than willing to give it my time on
the go when I'm out of the office and a
comparable Ultrabook won't do the
MacBook Pro is king of portable video
editing thanks to well optimized
software and that's enough to make me
ditch the windows-based competition
Apple products certainly have their
drawbacks look they're expensive and I'd
be scared as hell to replace anything on
this device but
willing to take the risks because of how
much easier I can content create on this
particular machine even the base MacBook
Pro will do just make sure you're
prepared to constantly delete files 128
gigs is awfully small now with that I
know a lot of you are gonna be enraged
I've never been afraid though to speak
my mind and to give you guys my opinion
of a product based on my personal use I
know no one is gonna feel exactly the
same as me no no two people are alike
but with that said I do feel like I've
justified it enough in my own mind to
continue using this for the foreseeable
future there are a few laptops that do
you want to try out though the huawei
mate book X Pro looks pretty sweet it's
very similar in fact in profile to the
MacBook Pro 13 inch model I might give
that a go it's Windows 10 but it does
have a dedicated GPU MX 150 I believe
with the quad core KB Lake our i7 CPU
for about 1500 bucks so it's a little
more than the base macbook pro but it
looks like a pretty sweet package and I
love that nearly edgeless display so go
ahead and blow up the comments if you
like that's what you need to do I
totally understand you can dislike or
liked the video based on your emotions
right now
I just totally find not gonna take it
personally but I think from my initial
case scenario here when I'm on the go a
lot and I need a video at it fast
the MacBook Pro is just a no-brainer at
least for now we'll see in the
foreseeable future give this video a
thumbs up you that as cool a thumbs down
for the opposite or if you hate
everything about life don't be shy click
that red subscribe button stay tuned for

this is science studio I almost said
this is MacBook Pro out of an
embarrassing thanks for learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
