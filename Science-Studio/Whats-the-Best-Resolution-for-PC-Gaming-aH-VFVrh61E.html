60% of users have a primary display
resolution of 1920 by 1080
that's 1080p for short and according to
a smaller survey conducted on our own
Twitter handle at science studio YT by
the way nearly 60% of sampled users said
approximately two feet from their
monitor or multi-monitor setup we tend
to gravitate toward an optimal viewing
distance from our display of choice
right so if we can see pixels we back
away and if it's too difficult to see
anything on screen and move a little
closer no two monitors are alike both in
terms of size and resolution so what
resolution then is the best for gaming
and just a heads up it's not a
straightforward answer I want to
introduce you to this fancy little
equation based on assumptions derived
from the quote visual acuity a threshold
a fancy phrase referencing how far we
have to be from something before you can
no longer to certain individual details
if we assume 1 arcminute to be the limit
of detailed discernment for the human
eye from where we get things like the
Snellen chart which I'm sure most of
your classes have seen before then this
equation will accurately calculate your
optimal viewing distance now it seems
like a mouthful upfront but the
variables represent a simple plug and
chug format VD here represents viewing
distance D s is your displays diagonal
size in HR and in VR are the displays
native horizontal and vertical pixel
counts and CVR is the vertical
resolution of the image displayed on
screen assuming your up scaling or down
scale has what this accounts for so
there's a really no complex math
involved here just division
multiplication power of square roots
that's it so let's use the info we
received from users earlier to calculate
an optimal viewing distance given a
resolution of 1080p and a common
diagonal size of let's say 24 inches for
a 1080p panel we can swap these
variables for real figures VD equals 24
divided by the square root of 19 20
divided by 1080 squared plus 1 times 10
80 times the tangent of 1 over 60 and
make sure if you do this equation in
Excel that you incorporate the
conversion between radians and degrees
so in this case it comes out to
approximately 37 and a half inches and
what this tells us given these
parameters is that you'll experience
loss of detail when sitting further than
this distance away from a 24 inch 1080p
monitors playing a 1080p
image if we replace the image on screen
with something half as pixel dense in
one dimension that's 540 P then the max
distance before detail lost jumps from
37 inches to roughly 75 and this makes
sense right if you have the resolution
of the image displayed then you can
double your viewing distance a comedy
for that loss and lose no detail that's
what this equation basically tells us it
links resolution to viewing distance
with respect to display size now if we
shrink the diagonal display to let's say
18 inches right much smaller then the
detail lost threshold shrinks from 34 to
28 inches so display size and viewing
distance our of course directly
proportional because PPI changes as that
diagonal space right tends to shrink or
expand and just one more example if we
bump the display resolution from 1080p
to Ultra HD or non cinema 4k then the
loss threshold shrinks to a mere 19
inches 4k is a huge jump from 1080p book
in terms of actual PPI and overall
Hardware utilization which is why most
4k monitors on the market are larger
than 24 inches so in this example you
have to sit within 19 inches of the 24
inch 4k panel to actually reap the
benefits of a true high intensity 4k
image otherwise it's going to look the
same as say a 1080p panel there are
several complementing charts by the way
linking the two this one here attempts
to quantify the relationship between
viewing distance panel size and optimal
resolution in a visual manner by the way
do keep in mind that this calculator of
sorts should only really be used to
determine maximum viewing distance
you're likely to notice extra details on
screen the closer you sit to the display
up to a certain point of course then
viewing angles becomes a huge factor in
the fact that you can discern individual
pixels when you get too close that means
your resolution isn't high enough this
is also why curved monitors make more
sense for gamers and casual TV viewers
you'd have to assume everyone watching
the screen is sitting in the exact same
place which of course doesn't happen not
in a living room so curved panels favor
a single viewer and while I'm not
completely sold on them I mean it's kind
of a separate topic but I wouldn't pay a
great deal of money extra for curved
panel I do notice slight benefits
especially with ultra wide resolutions
like the one behind me here this one is
a 34 40 by 1440p panel so the best
resolution for gaming depends entirely
on your monitor size its resolution and
your viewing distance from the monitor
this ignores of course refresh rate
which is an entirely separate topic
explained right here by the way and the
necessary hardware needed to adequately
Drive these pixels again totally
separate topic now if you ask me
1440p is a great sweet spot for a decent
gaming rig I use the Asus 27-inch 1440p
165 Hertz monitor from my gaming rig and
the resolution is almost perfect
considering how far away from the screen
I usually sit that's about two to three
feet I also prefer a higher refresh rate
over a higher pixel count so I would
trade 4k for you know 144 it's 1080p any
day of the week I can personally discern
pixels on a 24 inch 1080p panel from
about two feet away but when I step up
to 1440p in the same format it's almost
perfect the goal is to minimize
resolution as much as possible to
alleviate stresses on your graphics card
and CPU while maintaining the maximum
level of visual detail possible without
being able to discern individual pixels
that was a very long sentence and you
may need to rewind it but you'll find
most of this to be I mean common sense
right save maybe the detail of the
equation that we showed earlier I've
linked a few excellent monitors by the
way in the video description if you are
in the market I invite you to take a
look and comment down below with your
current visual setup if you guys like
