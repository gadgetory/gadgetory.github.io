skylake cpu overclocking thanks to
numerous windows and BIOS updates much
of that however never manifested I still
have builds with non k overclocking UEFI
is that are on the latest Windows
updates the microcode rumor was just
that only a rumor so what does this mean
can we still overclock nan k intel
skylake cpus four months ago the answer
was still yes I verified it right here
and today the answer is still yes
so the overkill I 3pc build the Destin
and I worked on a few videos ago will be
our guinea pig today last time it was a
pentium g 4400 if you're interested in
the specs of this one click right here
otherwise let's get to some base clock
overclocking all you need is a z170
motherboard and any consumer grade
skylake processor so any pentium i 3 i 5
or i7 non-case q2 other things to note
are 1 cpu temperatures will be nearly
impossible to monitor after the new bios
is flash there are a few programs that
work around this linked in the
description and to your eye GPU or your
integrated graphics will be disabled as
long as it's non k overclocking bios is
flashed but don't worry if at any point
you aren't willing to make these
trade-offs any longer you can always
flash a newer bios there's nothing
stopping you from doing that just make
sure it's the correct bios so here we go
first navigate to the motherboard BIOS
link in this video's description select
the motherboard brand you're currently
sporting and then click on the exact
motherboard name refer to your box if
you're not 100% sure mine was the
gigabyte z170 X gaming 3 motherboard
select download and save the zip folder
to a USB Drive from there simply extract
the folder that's it with the drive
still inserted in your PC reset the
computer and press delete or the
corresponding key to push you into your
BIOS from here find either a tab that
says Q flash or BIOS update after
clicking this option select the drive
you wish to boot from navigate to your
newly extracted BIOS file and execute at
this point do not turn off your PC let
the bar reach 100% at which point your
computer will reset itself if your PC's
power is cut off at any point during the
update process it's very likely that you
end up with a massive motherboard
paperweight no I don't need a
replacement board or a replacement UEFI
chip either way this is a painstaking
process so be sure to allow this process
to finish unhindered next restart your
computer and enter your BIOS once again
may look different or it may look
exactly the same either way if it was
flashed successfully we should now be
able to raise our base clock frequency
freely navigate over to CPU
configuration and at this point begin
raising your base clock value in
increments that correspond to CPU
voltage appropriate CPU voltage until
you end up with a satisfied frequency do
keep in mind that raising the base clock
frequency will also increase RAM
frequency so we configure this after the
fact or your PC will likely not boot for
more detailed CPU overclocking
in general click right here otherwise
let's restart our PC and verify that the
overclock did in fact stick and boom
there it is 4.4 gigahertz at one point
three five volts fairly confident that I
can do better with the voltage but this
is just a quick demonstration our jump
in Cinebench from 3.7 gigahertz to 4.4
diggers is nearly 100 CB in almost 25%
CP performance increase thanks to the
now possible base clock overclock just
make sure you've got a beefy enough
cooler to back up the overclock I do not
recommend doing this with the stock
Intel cooler it's just not going to
dissipate enough heat you'll end up with
a really hot system or a really loud
system or even worse both my core temps
in Cinebench alone jump from 44 degrees
Celsius to 76 and I'm sporting a 280
millimeter Kraken X 61 so just some
perspective there if you liked this
video and/or are thoroughly intrigued by
the fact that you can still overclock
non K and Tell Scylla excuse be sure to
give this video a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you feel the complete
opposite or if your Intel because I'm
sure Intel hates me at this point be
sure to click the subscribe button if
you haven't already and stay tuned for
interesting DRAM tests this time around
I'm going to start testing four gigs of
ram tomorrow then eight gigs then 12
weeks and 16 gigabytes of system ram see
how that affects in-game performance
this is science studio thanks for
learning this
