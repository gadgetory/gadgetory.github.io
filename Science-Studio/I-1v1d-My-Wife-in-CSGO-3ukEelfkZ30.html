very special room here at the air a cool
Presidential Suite where two pcs have
been set up using primarily Aero cool
components this is their suite after all
and we're gonna use all of their
hardware to 1v1 it's gonna be me and my
wife who used to be a professional csgo
player she is in fact much better than I
am we're gonna see how much better
though because I suck at csgo I have
never really played it seriously more
like a pub G like Call of Duty type
person so she's definitely got an edge
but how much of an edge and will I
actually get a chance to win one or two
rounds we'll find out in this video
first up we're gonna show you guys the
hardware so peripheral wise what you're
looking at here are the arrow pool ak7
thunder x3 it's their gaming brand and
the a m7 which is the gaming mouse over
there this keyboard in particular sports
cherry MX blue genuine switches they
feel really good although I'm not sure
many people would want to use blue
switches for gaming that's more or less
a preference and then over here we have
the quartz Pro highlighted this is a bit
in our previous air-cool video and this
thing is an absolute beast full tower
full on custom water cooling support if
you're into that sort of thing they do
have an AI o in here with I believe a
core i7 16 gigs of ram and a gtx 1070
now off to the right the pc at least is
gaming on currently the s4 monitor is
just a bit bigger most people who play
csgo want smaller monitors so i might
use that one just because i don't really
have a preference one way or the other
she is using the same peripherals so
everything has been pretty much leveled
out across the field this is still a gtx
1070 an i7 16 gigs of ram and a quartz
RGB so a smaller mid tower case
all right I blame my wait are you
birthright is my hand okay it was not
even moving worse though she and I say
that this is called you strike language
why do I only have silence like m16s
over here yeah I have two
after a drones it's gonna switch the
sides and then you have a key
you pull the files you want me to treat
they came to us for just a second blood
flying
yeah you'll saw it jump Soyuz not
supposed to jump no I can still hit you
I can't hit you in your legs
I can completion
so we're na√≠vi I just felt like it
pretty good
okay guys you won't see any headshots
anymore because I have to shoot someone
in his balls what
I wasn't ready yet give me a chance you
wanted your head you wanted to make it
quick go right okay fine quicker quicker
want that fast pace action woman camping
how can you camp on this man saw that
are you are using a sniper no I didn't
use sniper it wasn't a sniper I just
picked up a sniper you want me to use a
sniper no oh you don't know this is a
sniper so you can see the difference
you're just waiting for me to pick
something up and then shoot me when I
poke out on the camp I give you a chance
to pick something up that's what it's
cold
I can't I saw you I can put I can rush
shoot I can't camp I guess my kind of
crazy
yeah just rush me just rush me okay okay
it's funny how you're not to rush but I
am okay what gun are using this is and
how old is shooting once and killing me
when I'm like spring
you can look at my GeForce experience
savings how that works that's where you
are see look you just in post that's
what you're doing
whoa-ohh posting up and then when I
avoid valueless oh I got her I was
walking you can see it on my recordings
the good thing about it I have proof Oh
what good did you use em for without
silencer are you aiming at my head or
something how am i dropping so yeah of
course I aim in your head yeah I play
your game let's see I'll play this
little dancing game of yours yeah oh
yeah
that's right she's good if she dies
twice and she starts questioning her
life I'm just standing on one position
on you okay shots did I blow your way
I still have 52 HP I'm trashed I got six
no that's what's counter strike we're
gonna strike just taking this head shot
she's an angry using a pistol yeah I was
using a piss while I do not feel as
accomplished now you know the good thing
about this is after I destroyed you you
have to edit this video and see how I
destroyed you again
sit down yeah sit down Yuji is my god
okay go ahead it you're headed you
almost hit honey here's a controller you
want to play with a controller no I
sprayed all right here we go because I'm
playing I will saw that I will show you
in real life how this looked like oh my
like I'm showing you now or this looks
nice right it's moving oh I'm I'm
sneaking left-to-right off this well
forget it I'm doing really well
oh my god you're trash Oh trash I just
killed your mind I don't mess around
oh there is nothing you can say
absolutely nothing you love the headshot
oh I bet you're so jealous right now
oh it's picking up a good oh you were
picking up a gun I'm sorry where were
you that's trash right in front of you
let's be straight up yeah I always try
to pick my gun
that's right you guys see it four to
five he ain't far off the mark gear no
I'm sorry playing professions yes go it
looks like anybody can do it oh wow
spring how are you not dying this is not
prep team you wanna have a pistol mmm no
yes
I'll come on or you give him a head shut
know how much help that you have left
for oh I knew I was close
Sheila skill are you going on my side oh
come on she was so close to Tony hey so
your head what is this
y'all so the jump shot Oh looking good
oh yes how can i fucking a random sprain
but I'll reload reload reload
Paulie ran out of bullets is that so
oh my god a kid
yeah you have only two until you have to
reload honey boy
how many shots really you ain't I always
run out of ammo before you die only
twice he's serious this game is weird
cuz it looks like I'm hitting you every
time I shoot this how many times did I
hit you there four times or something oh
god I knew what was close I ran out of
ammo again how do you reload or yes
really can you kick this into this can
you keep this in the shot
how many shots at the chest can you take
I don't know what did I hit you yes but
I got I hit you too or should have yeah
yeah I had 48 39 to be precise odd
spamming it at your body
well that was very expected I think that
I definitely have room for improvement
you did fairly well considering the
hardware you were using isn't the
hardware used to using right and
professional players usually have like a
specific Mouse and a specific keyboard
that they always practice and play on
right I have to say I have to confess
that I'm disappointed with myself
because usually you wouldn't get one
kill yeah that's right you know so I got
four kills one round yeah but yeah I
have to say that I really like the mouse
and a keyboard were pretty cool but I
don't like the mouse pad because I
prefer rubber surface and this was a
speed mouse but that was distracting me
a little bit otherwise for those though
that prefer a surf face a speed surface
they're good to go
sounds like an excuse to me anyway guys
thanks for watching we are ready to end
Computex coverage it's about time we've
been very very busy this would be one of
the last videos we upload so don't worry
when I can flood your inboxes much
longer with this content you know I'm
like a two to three hour basis so thanks
for watching hope you guys at least had
a laugh or two out of it and thanks
Erica for supplying us the hardware for
this video we had a great time filming
maybe not a great time playing but I'll
practice this is science studio thanks
for playing with us
