articles trying to answer the following
question what exactly does 14 nanometers
mean when it comes to central and
graphics processing units particularly
the Polaris and skylake lineups trusted
reviews.com claims that the term 14
nanometers quote refers to the size of
the transistors that are used to make a
whole integrated circuit or chip this is
not correct and I sincerely hope that
trusted reviews fixes this sentence once
this video airs let's discuss what this
size actually defines the Intel skylake
i7 6700 K was created on a 14 nanometer
fabrication note the AMD Polaris R X 480
was also created on a 14 nanometer note
fun fact so or the iPhone 6s and galaxy
s6 so this does not mean that individual
transistors within each die or 14
nanometers long tall wide however you
want to look at it it means none of
those things
in fact by its definition alone it
doesn't even have to describe an aspect
of a transistor so here's what it does
mean in the case of the two affer
mentioned processors the term 40
nanometers or any lithographic length
for that matter is defined as the degree
of precision within each fabrication it
details how precise individual edgings
can be on the surface of a silicon wafer
and what this number physically
describes ultimately depends on the
thinness parallel points on each
transistor well that's what it used to
define each of the billions of field
effect transistors comprising a single
processor carry a source drain and a
number of gates the gate ultimately
controls the flow of electrons between
the latter and in modern 14 nanometer
processors wraps tightly around each fin
on a transistor in an effort to reduce
current leakage once upon a time this
length actually meant something
typically the length of the transistor
gate but as senior fellow and technology
and manufacturing group director of
Intel mark Bohr proclaims he currently
quote can't point to the one dimension
that's 32 or 22 or 40 nanometers on any
of these processors but some dimensions
are smaller than the stated node name
and others are larger so does this mean
that 14 nanometers is a bit misleading
well in short yes very it used to be
quite simple with planar transistors
however thanks to 3d thin arrays it gets
quite complicated for instance and Intel
has
while i7 4790k is developed around a 22
nanometer node but individual fins on a
single transistor within the cpu are
only eight nanometers wide so by the
very definition of a lithographic length
technically Haswell CPUs are eight
nanometers not twenty-two since eight
nanometers is the finest degree of
precision for that slice of silicon in
short by today's standards these lengths
are more like milestone indicators for
companies an example this would be
Global Foundries 14 nanometer chips
Super Monte can Jerry vice president of
advanced technology architecture a
Global Foundries revealed his first
generation 14 nanometer FinFET chips
essentially recycled old 20 nanometers
framework and simply quote plugged in
FinFET making this new technology quote
20 nanometer FinFET in a way and quote
meaning that the company simply reduced
the width a graphic numeral for the sake
of signifying the change from a planner
to thin design misleading yes
although most consumers are unlikely to
notice except for all of you watching
this video this is science studio thanks
