to come across on YouTube and that
there's a good reason for that I
recommend you stick to sites like Tom's
Hardware and Johnny guru for the fine
details we can't test things like load
regulation hold up time and ripple
levels the equipment is just too
expensive and I honestly doubt we'd ever
realize a true ROI so simply put those
topics are for the specialists and I'll
happily defer to them but in this case
there are a few things we can talk about
and test I'd like you to meet the
silverstone nightjar 450s XL the vnj 450
falls under the sfx elf form factor
which is the awkward middle child
between standard ATX and sfx power
supplies it's an interesting size
especially considering it won't fit in
many small form factor cases including
one my favorite the fractal design node
202 though to be fair silverstone
themselves of do manufacture many cases
for which this psu would be perfect you
just gotta have one of those on hand but
another issue is that silverstone
doesn't include an S effects to ATX
adapter either so unless you
specifically got a case begging for SF
XL which I doubt you'll need to buy an
adapter online if you wish to use this
PSU in a standard ATX case which is what
most people have on hand I've linked one
down below it by the way if you're
interested if you want to pair this PSU
with something larger than a
conventional SF XL chassis what you will
find in the box is a manual the unit
modular cable sets and a power cable the
PSU is fully modular and the cables are
slightly shorter than ATX especially
this a pin eps cable this one will not
fit in a traditional ATX chassis it's
way too short so you can definitely see
you know how Silverstone sculpted this
power supply to fit in their style case
right in a case that supports s FX L but
not necessarily ATX this unit by the way
does come with four sets of eight pin
VGA cables so if you want to run two
graphics cards that are to eight pin
cards apiece then you could power that
through this unit although I doubt the
wattage rating would be enough to run a
dual graphics card config so you just
have to kind of feel it out but in most
cases it's not going to work you just
have that breathing room if you want
like a you know overcooked card that
maybe has
I don't know 3/8 pin connectors which is
very hard to come by but in most cases
you're not gonna worry about graphics
card power at all with the unit like
this next on the list is silver stones
80-plus platinum rating for this unit
quite a large feat for such a small unit
especially for one without a fan which
is perhaps the biggest selling point
here the idiot plus rating system scales
system load with total power draw from
the wall and a platinum rating signifies
a minimum peak efficiency of a 92% this
peak occurs somewhere around the 50%
load which in this case is around 225
watts you're likely to go a bit higher
than that in most builds you'll get
around 300 watts or so but this is still
plenty of breathing room for most
conventional single CPU single GPU
configurations recall that higher
ratings yield lower energy losses in the
form of heat when power from the wall is
rectified and transformed the only tier
higher than platinum is titanium by the
way reserved for the most efficient PSUs
on the market in this case though the NJ
450 is rating is more than satisfactory
especially given its load wattage but
perhaps the biggest selling point again
of this unit is its fanless design and
according to silverstone the unit is
capable of maintaining a full load
temperature of approximately 40 degrees
celsius while not having a fan that is
impressive you can imagine how
technically difficult that was to
achieve silverstone uses several grooved
heat sinks along the frame of the unit
to increase surface area and convection
with the air and even when enclosed in a
tight case basement the temperature
remained safely below this level under
loads I feel like this is extra
breathing room just to you know cya
right this is where I expected things to
heat up quite a bit past spec but to my
surprise Silverstone left significant
Headroom in this 40 degree rating and
actually took it upon myself to
disassemble the unit I was a very
pleased to see that they were passively
cooling almost every major component in
there from the inductors to the
transformer they were all being
passively cooled with thermal pads that
were then contacting the shell of the
PSU so they're using the entire frame of
the unit to keep the components inside
very cool and that's how they get rid of
the necessity of a fan so a very unique
engineering here and I expect we'll see
more of this in the future
only a few power supplies out there
claim you know the fan
design and this one here appears to be
very well engineered at least from what
I can tell by taking off the top and
side panels it's such a strange like
feeling I don't know listening to a dead
silent power supply this thing makes no
noise at all member this is converting
AC to DC it's splitting up power loads
along a single 12 volt rail like it's
it's doing a lot of work and it is
getting quite hard but the the
elimination of a fan in here just makes
it so I don't know alien like it's just
that it's such a big step forward and I
do expect that we'll see more like this
in the future again but for now I mean
there are very exclusive lineups that
don't feature fans this is one of them
the fact that they were able to keep it
so small at the same time right SFX elf
smaller than traditional ATX and delete
the fan is I guess it's just an
impressive feat I mean I tried listening
for any noise at all I tried listening
for coil 1 from the inductors any
rattling in the transformer it is dead
silent and it doesn't really make sense
to even throw up a you know a DB graph
because it doesn't compare to anything
else with a fan I mean this is truly a
silent unit so all of my initial testing
has proven this to be a great power
supply now long-term reliability is a
different story but you guys know me if
anything does happen even if it's a
fault of my own I won't hesitate to
expose it though I highly doubt this PSU
will have any QC issues based on what
I've seen and thus far so a great job
Silverstone in my book now what you guys
think in the comments below that's a
different story possibly what power
supply you sporting would you consider
this for a small form-factor build I
want to know in the comments down below
let's duke it out if we disagree totally
fine with that give this video a thumbs
up thought it was cool dislike it if you
feel the complete opposite or if you
hate everything about life you can click
