we're live now this is probably gonna be
probably gonna be or well beckon some
audio calibration on my part so I am
waiting for all of you to tell me what
is so terribly wrong with the audio
that's usually what's wrong with the
thing and I will be sure to help you
guys out if the audio is trashed let me
know yeah I literally like created a
second account on this computer so that
I could have my own OBS settings without
leases and you know me having the
messers up and so I kind of just long it
last minute like in 5-10 minutes set up
what I needed OBS simple wise it's why
there's nothing really complicated going
on it's crazy
it's just me audio is low okay it's
quite yeah so we're gonna give it a bump
all right you guys let me know now how
it sounded how is it sounding now and
then see I have to wait for about what
10 15 seconds to make sure this is legit
some guys think it's really bad but
you're good all right now you're gonna
see I'm watching you guys live right now
react to this I need it more are you
just trolling still pretty low Wow okay
got to turn it up some mo all right I'm
in the yellow now I'm not going any
higher than that
I'm a little I'm a little sketched out
now I think some people don't blow their
drums
still too little yeah if it's if it's
too low like if some of you guys think
it's too low turn your volume up like
that's all I can really say it's like
I'm I'm literally almost peaking right
now on OBS so bump your volume even if
you got to turn it back down for
something else later
is
want to scare the heck out of people who
might not have the right volume settings
it's nothing it okay cool I got this is
right here listen to the live stream too
so some of you guys have no idea what
you're talking about but I do think it
was a little low because I had it set
lower which is preferable because if it
gets a little high up front then you
guys really hate me I'd rather be low
than high out of the gate gif or Jif I
think that answers your question then a
bar hog watch its jib dude it's just
it's jiff
yeah it's not really that low dank
Walker gaming says I can do this but my
phone wouldn't be good you need to turn
up game on Mike and not OBS it has
nothing to do with the mic or oh it's
it's OBS is showing me exactly what I'm
getting fed from the mic there's nothing
if I turn up the gain on the mic it's
gonna peak in OBS OBS is showing me
exactly what you guys are hearing why oh
wait is it okay to buy a gigabyte gaming
laptop Shore I think gaming laptops are
an interesting proposition right now
especially in light of how expensive
desktop discreet graphics are when
laptop do you recommend for a CSE major
XPS 15 is a really good choice I would
prefer a Windows laptop for for that
kind of major if you want to go with
trying to think of something else that's
not Dell I know Asus has some pretty
sweet powerhouses I mean you could
really go with any gaming laptop that
has an SSD in it I'd say have an SSD
over a hard drive would be preferable
just it's not going to be very loud and
at least when you're you know idle and
it will have the horsepower thanks to
discreet the dedicated GPU in there so
just get one for sure with a dedicated
GPU whenever you do rendering
simulations and whatnot I experienced
that with an XPS 13 we would run well
simulations and in in class you know
just basically we'd have points of water
injection we do water floating and we'd
see how that effect
the the rate at which oil passes through
pores and a given medium and we would
have to simulate that over the course of
like ten years and having to repeat that
process per day which would be your
typical interval would be pretty extreme
for an XPS 13 what he did it I mean it
took it took about ten to fifteen
minutes and on my desktop it was like a
I think I had a 5820k in there the
desktop took maybe five minutes it's not
really too bad when you look at it you
know just from a Architecture standpoint
you get what two cores and four threads
running at pretty low frequency I would
say that it's not gonna hurt you if you
go with an ultra-low power chip but
pumping it up to a gaming laptop grade
LA would be preferable let's see turn
about 2.2 baht $2 donation I can't speak
tonight it's what time is it it's 1024
CST what's your favorite PC case on the
market my man I've answered that in like
legit I think the video title was this
is my favorite case I didn't say on the
market but like that was implied it is a
fractal design metruff I see and I'm a
surprise excuse me the defined C
tempered glass Edition the only the only
thing I don't like about the mash if I
see I love that the airflow is
prioritized in the mesh spicy but I
don't like how that front panel is is
just I don't know it's hard to explain I
would sacrifice airflow for the sake of
having more hardware compatibility so if
I had to put fans between that front of
the chassis and the cover of the define
C I would have done it before not great
for temps at all but if you're running
you know an a IO and a moderate
overclock it's not gonna kill you it's
not too loud either but with a mesh if I
see you have no choice but to put
everything on the inside of the chassis
so if you have a long graphics card any
Asus card for example a Strix edition
card will not fit if you have an AO in
there as well that's just a consequence
of how narrow the cases I saw question
of people is pretty intriguing Brandon
says how Brandon ham right how would you
differ differentiate yourself from other
popular tech tubers like Jason
with Paul's hardware tickets at etc so
that was my that was my challenge going
into this whole thing right how do I
make myself look any different or appear
any different then you know I needed the
other guys out there because when I
started all the other guys had 500k +
subs and that was just a consequence of
me getting in late in the game and a few
other channels have gotten in late as
well the tech deal is the guy we we just
did the giveaway with it so going on by
the way tech deals is a fairly new
channel if I'm not mistaken at least
that was I just started noticing that he
was you know popping up into the Tex
fear and I was like well this is pretty
cool so he he's a relatively new channel
tune he's done very well he's gotten to
he is about the same growth pattern we
had back back in the day and things
would definitely slowed down a lot
thanks to youtube in general I think
that it's kind of motivation though to
differentiate even further I try to
explain things in a more in-depth manner
than most of the tech tubers out there I
would say one the only ones that gets
more in depth it's probably gamblers
Nexus they really take things like
they're they're very particular but if
you notice many of their videos last 10
to 20 minutes right they take a long
time to explain stuff because there's so
much detail that they cover and all the
power to them that's how they do it
that's their style and that's why they
are as popular as they are but it's just
too much detail for me I mean you gotta
you know they have a website right so
their website was their thing before
their YouTube channel really took off
and so the website you could just list
facts list details and that was it but
when you when you have to present it in
video you've got to kind of Teeter both
things right you got to be entertaining
on one side cuz people actually have to
want to watch you and then you also have
to be informative so finding a way to
combine those two how to be an
informative yet entertaining channel was
a challenge for me and I think we've
done a good enough job to this point I'm
just trying to be different and with how
tough it is now to just stand out I
think it's just more of a kick in the
butt to keep trying to change
let's see trill Murray five dollar
donation I appreciate that how can you
tell if a monitor over clock is stable
my AG 27 to 71 qgs factory overclocks to
165 seems stable my GPU won't idle and I
think I noticed some micro stutter hmm
that's weird I I've never had experience
with micro Sol de I have a 165 or it's a
sous monitor and I think it's the PG 279
q QR it's the TN version they have an
IPS version as well but that monitor i
over clock that one I can overclock it
but it's I guess it's like a stock
overclock to 165 Hertz because it's
supposed to be native 144 and it's super
smooth all the time I've never noticed a
single split of stutter at all granted
it does have G sync if yours doesn't F
do you think it might be that that's
causing it but I would say even if I
mean if you're using like a an AMD card
with the g-sync monitor it's not gonna
matter you just can't take advantage of
g-sync but the refresh rate is still
there and if you're using something like
vsync in-game then you shouldn't see
micro stutters I would say that's
probably a monitor the effect unless
you've got some weird setting just
throwing that thing off let's see
Pullman's tech how's it going it's going
well I don't have a plan or course of
action I am just I'm just here talking
and trying to feed off of you guys's
questions this livestream will end when
you guys stop asking questions that is
say I won't be streaming all night but
as long as I have content which is you
guys are giving me the content I will
try to I will try to answer and keep the
livestream going we have approximately
240 people watching right now I
appreciate it fellas there are any
ladies out there I appreciate you as
well
Gavin Martin $5 donation thank you for
that Gavin how do I get the best deals
on used PC parts this is when I really
wish we had a program like PC part
picker for the use market it's a lot
different for the used market because
things aren't permanent or permanent at
least on a short-term basis so PC part
picker sources from a bunch of vendors
right new AG Amazon
NCIX when they were still alive what
were some of the other ones outlet PC
I'm trying to think of some of the ones
that would show up right on the list and
they would show you the prices for the
exact same component on multiple sites
and they can do that because those parts
are usually in stock for a solid amount
of time so things are accurate but on
the use market I can put up a graphics
card tonight and it sell tomorrow and
that won't even hit PC part pickers
radar even if they wanted it to because
sales like that or temporary so you just
got to look at yourself you have to
literally take the time yourself to to
search sites like eBay let let go or
some of the other ones
there's Craigslist of course and just
you just third third party use sites
where you can sell stuff on your own you
can use Facebook marketplace if you
wanted it you just have to actually take
the time to search is it worth it yes if
you find something you need and you are
able to get a solid discount on it and
the product works I'm assuming then
you're gonna be all set truck or bomb
again predictions unexpected overclock
for 2,700 X so I saw something about 2.0
it's getting to point well out of an ad
4.2 gigahertz on the 2700 X for those
who are not sure what the 27 RDX is that
is the the the next step for risin right
so the 1700 X and you have the 2700 X
which would be an improvement upon the
original Rison architecture so risin to
if you will well and I expect that's
that's probably an accurate an accurate
assumption around 4.2 gigahertz I would
say out of the box which we should
expect because this is a refinement
right of the original architecture we're
expecting anywhere between a 5 to 15%
IPC gain I would lean more towards 10%
between 5 and 10% I don't think it's in
be high as 15%
unless you're accounting for the
overclocks but then it's not IPC because
it's supposed to be instructions per
clock right so I'm expecting that be
true I would say if it's if it's between
four and four point three gigahertz I'll
be like okay yeah that's what we should
expect I'm not gonna be surprised
if it's out-of-the-box overclock 24.4 I
mean if it turbos or whatever whatever
AMD calls I want remember if it if it
clocks up to four point four gigahertz
then I'll be pretty surprised by that
that's a pretty substantial jump from
whatever the 1,800 X's is I names for
bigger it's out of the box so pretty and
pretty impressive if that is true
let's see Aztec asked what ethnicity I
am I am a Spanish so European descent
mostly there's a few I have a few
distant relatives from Mexico which I
guess you could argue eventually leads
back to Spain and then a little Italian
some German my mom's side of the family
is very German and anything else Western
European you can think of probably but
my dad's mainly Spanish my mom's English
in German I would say for the most part
let's see here she's laughing at me
she thinks I'm making this stuff up I'm
not making it up I'm not it's yeah I
mean it does say H on my ethnicity
though it does say H naught W oh no you
can't say W on your ethnicity right
that's your race so you're a white
Hispanic male cuz White's your race cuz
they give you European right but
Hispanic is like your sub race ethnicity
it's dumb it's like where's the bridge
between race which I get race that's
pretty distinct that's a definition
right but then you get ethnicity which
is like what's the difference between
that and nationality or race for that
matter like worse where does ethnicity
fit in between the two because you could
be you know black and living in Canada
but that doesn't make you white so I'm
sayin or the opposite you could be white
living in Ghana that doesn't make you
black so I don't know the dead all that
stuff it's kind of weird to me I think
it's all just just politics and
paperwork people trying to be different
no idea what I appreciate the donations
fellas the marking puffs thank you for
that for and
I don't know what it is about ending in
$0.99 though you guys like that's like
the second one I've seen in this stream
so mark and puff thank you for that 499
donation I really appreciate that it's
putting 2 em aside 1080 t eyes gaming
extras and good guards by the way I've
seen a few reviews of those an SLI
useful or as one video card enough so I
guess you're just questioning the
viability of SLI overall it really
depends a lot of newer games are
generally gonna be crossfire and SLI
compatible but the the benefit that
you'll reap from that SLI config is not
going to justify the cost of the extra
card in most cases solely for gaming if
you're doing a bunch of really weird
rendering and just like you know
hardcore editing with software that's
not you know gonna leverage you most of
your CPU any GPU accelerated task that's
optimized for SLI or crossfire is gonna
heavily benefit from that config but in
in most scenarios when people ask me
should I get to 10 70s or a 1080 Ti I
just tell them 1080i because first off
your power consumption is gonna be new
uh it depends power consumption in SLI
usually scales to the first card I
usually max out its TDP maybe go a
little above that if you overclock and
then the second one is gonna be leverage
around 50% or so and the same goes for
performance you know if you're getting
100 frames in with a 1070 if you put a
second 1070 there you're not gonna get
200 frames you're gonna get something
like 130 140 frames per second so it
definitely drops off hard and in most
cases I would say it's not worth getting
to one there gonna be plenty unless
you're gaming with like three 4k 140
Hertz 1 40 or 120 Hertz monitors and
then I would probably tell you that
that's necessary
Sean Martin I need money yeah I mean
anabolic SC says Greg you're gonna play
star citizen I likely will I don't even
know what star system is but sure
playhead you know what star citizen is
alright we're gonna figure that out
let's see trill Maria
appreciate that $2 donation $2 can
someone donate tree fitty please I just
want to be able to say somebody donated
tree fitty just once you don't know I
gotta do it just one person donate tree
fitty and don't make it like three
hundred and fifty dollars just make it
three dollars and fifty cents so I can
say someone donated tree fitty Thank You
trimmer for the $2 donation I appreciate
that says one more question audio or
outie track-day video I mean the the s5
really isn't a track car it's really not
because if you look at the spec sheet I
didn't know what's going into it but I
should have assumed this because it's
all-wheel drive it's got a heavy v8 in
there yeah I got heavy 19-inch rims and
it's a fairly big coupe it weighs like
40 100 pounds the Cabriolet ways that's
a convertible that way is 4,300 pounds
if I'm not mistaken that's a heavy car
most sports cars stay around 3000 pounds
or whatever convert that to kilograms
just divided by 2.2 but that's that's
the average sports car weight I would
say like a Corvettes gonna be around and
I don't let let's just see what see what
Corvette is 2017 Corvette wait got to be
in the 3s 3200 to 3600 pounds so yeah
anything in the threes is pretty good if
you're in the mid threes your average my
cars at 4 it's a little over 4 so it
doesn't turn very well granted it does
have a degree of torque vectoring
because that Quattro system
I love the grip it's really difficult to
even spin the tires but I don't think a
track-day is necessary I think I'll
probably just do some I might take it to
a drag strip and do something weird like
hook it up with some nos tanks or
something but I don't think track days
are necessary ok what did I miss what
did I miss I missed something I missed
something Noah wants me to rub
mayonnaise on his belly button can we do
that Noah wants me to oh he don't eat a
tree fitty he don't eat a tree fitty
Noah makes Lanahan donated tree fitty to
say rub mayonnaise on my belly button
you my man Betty
I'm gonna take a screenshot of this do
we have snipping tool I'm sure yeah we
did all right I'm gonna take a
screenshot of this nobody else type in
the chat wait a sec I know it freezes
nevermind okay I'm gonna take a snapshot
of that and you my friend are gonna see
this picture on Twitter very soon
sorry about the loud keyboard I know
it's not quiet the mic so that we have
now that was pretty sweet
thank you put that tree fitty trucker
bomb I'm missing oh he also donated $2
up further up thanks Noah for the $2 and
a tree fitty and if you were here I
would totally rub mayonnaise on your
belly button on on-camera live right now
where are you
trucker bomb 2.29 oh my god dots on the
fractal design define see tge trucker
bomb i don't know if you're trolling but
like go watch the video all of my
thoughts are culminated into a video
it's what I do for a living I would
direct you to that in fact here I'll
tell you what because you donated I'll
go ahead and just search for it for you
so you don't got a you don't got to do
much Matt Damon wants you to answer
question Lisa so we're all in a second
she's right here next and by the way a
hard answer them saying Tommy Carlson I
see I see your donation I appreciate
that I don't know what SEK is but thanks
for that 2890 SEK that's cool
I'll answer that second I'm going to
search for define see tge let's see wait
wait what number video is mine come out
if you type in define see tge on youtube
which which let's see alright
define see tge review i'm clicking enter
my video is the one two three four five
six okay what's really weird no it's the
seventh video if you search for this
video which I'm going to link you right
now trucker bomb if you search for this
video it comes up
if you type in to find CT GE which I was
sure to rank for first here is that
video it's titled this is my favorite PC
case but the fourth video this shows up
on that same shirt search is the measure
Phi C which is not the define C I don't
know I don't know but they're both time
for class so YouTube is prioritizing a
case that's actually not the same case
as my own case and it's out ranking my
own video for a video that has nothing
to do with the tge
to find cui they have something to each
other pretty close but that's really
funny and weird
Tommy Carlson says superb Channel any
recommendations and smartphones
I like the LGP 30 I'm using that right
now it's a pretty sweet phone I love the
ultra wide camera the ability to switch
between ultra wide and a regular you
know narrow camera and the screen is
beautiful something like an 81 82 %
screen to body ratio for 1440p AMOLED
display it's a good phone all around
except for the front-facing camera it's
trash it just is and slow motion camera
capabilities on the be 30 or trash other
than that that's the phone I'd recommend
or the pixel 2 it's insanely good camera
or the iPhone 10 because I don't know I
feel like I should take that back now
let's see here I'm scrolling I see you
guys I'm sorry that there are so many
picture or so many comments like I'm
just I'm trying to answer some that
aren't don't or questions either but
it's like every time I do that I say c7
Corvette yeah 15:39 kg yep I see is a
GTX tempe TTI good for rising 3 1200 yes
it is it's a very good GPU for that I
have a video talking about I think GPU
and CPU balance is like what's a good
combo for this CPU or this CPU and I
think that's that's a good choice for
that
let's scrolling down a bit more whoa ok
I'm missing a bunch here I'm missing a
bunch here Wow
that will pay your electric bill for a
day he's a dangle Loch Ness monster I
know I'm trying to get to the to the
live chat I'm like
rolling up a little bit so I can see
tech with Miro three dollars and 49
cents you shorted me one penny dude one
penny you shorted me so that I could say
tree fiddy now I gotta say tree 49 which
sounds nothing like tree fitty but okay
I'll take it I'll take it I appreciate
that thank you very much I can't make it
to tree fiddy thoughts on liquid metal I
know a few people who use like a metal
pretty consistently I think I don't
think that the the benefits of liquid
metal out weigh the the cons of it I
mean no there's not really a con using
liquid metal in fact you have to have to
apply yourself I'm assuming you mean
liquid metal like the you know in place
of thermal paste if you don't mean that
then I don't know what you're talking
about but I generally choose thermal
paste I think it's perfectly fine you're
getting that extra one or two degrees
Celsius dropped from thermal from liquid
Mile excuse me is not justifiable my
opinion gameplay rush it says at a a
money sign for dollar twenty four twenty
I see what you did there I like that how
big it centimeters are you jealous bro
yeah he's jealous
thank you for your 4:20 though it's good
that's that's a good number
Jase on a ten dollar and fifty four cent
Jesus what is up with the pennies you've
got fifty four cents what do you think
of dual LGA 1366 Xeon versus single i7
from the current generation also what's
that poster behind you I have two
posters behind me actually this one is
assassin creed Assassin's Creed origins
and then the one on this side which you
still can't see almost it's called duty
world war two in that freaky look and
the dudes like barely looking around my
chest but we got to take them down
because we set up some shelving which is
why the microphone oh sorry about that
the microphone is hanging from the shelf
so it's out of sight from the camera
that's pretty cool and
we have to put them back up at some
point they're sitting there now cuz I'm
too lazy as to your question LGA 1366
Zeon's getting two of them is pretty
cool I've done a few things in the past
with Zeon's I think they're great value
propositions in spite not having
integrated GPUs but if you're willing to
spend that much money on you know a dual
CPU config then you're probably not
gonna stress that buying a graphics card
even in this market I would say the
problem though is getting a motherboard
for that motherboards dual saw got
motherboards in general to be pretty
expensive people tend to hoard them and
sell them at really high prices but if
you can get one for two or three hundred
bucks which would be tough but he can
get one for that cheap it's not trash
and two of those eons to be around an i7
performer I think that would be pretty
cool then you can tell people got dual
CPUs and they're sort of a dual core
chip dual CPU sounds really cool but
yeah that that'd be a cool project I
want to do something like that soon just
like an overkill for the wind PC mr. KF
gaming a dollar 49 donation I appreciate
that my dude thank you for the donation
let's see here is CPU speed important as
a general for a normal usage I say
general is CPU speed important as
general for no I don't know what you
Mertz
Murtaza I don't know what you just asked
money but ya know uh mcclanahan another
$5 donation my dude don't you got it's
chill mom it's okay just chill I
appreciate this but you ain't gotta
donate this much to ask questions to
dolla know holla hope you get that
reference check out McClanahan make
McClanahan Noah at gmail.com I just
shouted out your email address to 300
people so sorry about that thank you for
the donation appreciate it
Justin Parrish says replacing my oh wait
MacBook Pro the summer horizon 2800 X X
470 custom loop the works he's got it
all going folks total budgets around
$4,500 gaming slash streaming slash
production Titan XP Steny to TI's or
wait
PS Congrats on the engagement thank you
for that someone says congrats on our
guy
thank you mom she's thankful too okay I
was hoping she would be like yeah yeah I
don't know if she likes being engaged to
me anymore sometimes she does sometimes
she does thank you for that $10
combination Justin yeah look if you're
gonna go all out go all out you need
twenty hundred ex is pretty sweet and if
it's gonna be if it's gonna cost what we
expected to cost then more power to you
but that's gonna be a heck of a
replacement for your oh wait Mac that's
for sure
Titan XPS I would say they'll cut those
out just stick with any to TI's or wait
for whatever's coming next from a video
that's talk to you
let's see Joma fam by the way via sky
one who I made a moderator last time
thank you for doing your job I see a
bunch of like deleted tweets or deleted
messages I don't know if they're
actually like you know trashing messages
enough but thank you for doing that I
donated and it did not show up
Carson Adams it didn't show if it didn't
show up and it didn't donate I'm pretty
sure so don't freak out unless you see
like a get an email from something but
Carson if you want to ask your question
I will look for you
Carson Adams I got that name on my head
just ask your question again don't worry
about the donation I will do my best to
answer it
okay I got a scroll back up on to make
sure I didn't miss anything
collab with Joma I don't even know who
that is
Joma do you know Joe matech collab with
him he's growing really fast
I don't know Joe matang okay okay where
we going we're going where we going
well I'm Way up here what's going on
everyone's like Jonathan all right
Austin Clement three dollars and fifty
one cent really my dude one penny over
now y'all are just making fun of me you
just wanna make fun Anoma livestream I
mean I appreciate that like look to be
honest that three dollars and 51 cents
we're gonna go to the gas in my car
because it uses so much gas but I
appreciate that very much Thank You opes
i overshot opinion on the i-5 6600 and
1070 really good combo I invite you to
check out my video about whether an i7
is necessary for gaming it's pretty old
because nowadays right the eye
five that are recent have six course but
that video would be perfect to answer
your question because I use a 1072 bench
the i7 and the i5 the 6600 K and the
6700 K thanks for that donation why are
all youtubers sitting on these sitting
in a stupid over an overpriced chairs
again these are not stupid and
overpriced charity my dude these are
premium verdaguer chairs I use this
chair I also use the ergonomic one the
trigger t RI IG ger that's an ergonomic
one feels really good on my back this
one is just more of like a you know you
just you just chilling it and like
vertigo doesn't pay us anything to use
these they I literally asked them for
these chairs because I like them so I
don't get paid to show them off or
anything I just like them I would never
ever tie something I didn't like what's
your opinion on playing space Sims game
like elite dangerous high lots of space
but still dangerous right I don't know
what you just said Ronnie but it sounds
pretty sweet if you mix the Sims no you
said sim game simulation game on I got
excited when I saw sim I was thinking
The Sims like Sims - okay
I mean that's I liked universe and box -
a lot so if it's anything like that I'll
really enjoy it I'm scrolling down I'm
scrolling down trigger bomb $2 16 I send
donation things but that metric or
Imperial which is better
I think metric is better period I was
having a conversation with Lisa recently
it's all right base 10 base it's it's
all you just tack on a zero deduct to
zero that's how you go from you know
kilogram to gram to milligram it's super
simple you just slide the decimal over
you know with Imperial you got a you
know you know these stupid conversion
factors and it's just you know or it it
might not be super difficult to do like
there's 12 inches there's exactly 12
inches in a foot but the numbers aren't
as easy to work with and as an engineer
I can tell you it really is nice to
stick with metric and a problem you have
to work out because it's just it just
keeps things nice and pretty
you might up with a bunt you end up with
an answer that's a bunch of zeros in it
which is really good so you can write
like 3.5 times 10 to the 9th
instead of like three five four eight
four eight four eight five which is what
would happen if you
Kiril units we see potent ox at $2 and
to Australian donation appreciate that
with GPU assist rendering what's the HCC
CPU use case GPU is just rendered what I
wish I knew exactly what you were
talking about GPU is system rendering
are you talking about with Premiere Pro
GPU assisted rendering is really going
to do I mean it's what's gonna take on
most of the low when it comes to reading
raise your CPU and that's really the
case with any software they can think of
it's pretty mainstream the GPU is more
or less used for when you do playback
with special effects that you've done
your video when you've like color graded
and stuff you're gonna leverage your CPU
your GPU a bit more there but for
general rendering purposes the CPU is
gonna be weighted a lot more I don't
know if that answers your question but
no what if we got here what I've got
here would have got here I'm scrolling
back I'm scrolling I got wood what did I
miss a lot I'm here you guys are awesome
thank you for keeping the chat alive
this is my substance thank you
Kristiana of are gonna says nothing but
she donated $2 I appreciate that
oh she says SEK is Sweden Crona Swedish
Krona that's the oh that's really cool
it's a cool name for currency Crona i
like that
Crona yeah it was like SEK like five I
was like was SEK it's really cool thank
you for letting me know that so thank
you to whoever donated with SEK I don't
know how strong your currency is but
thank you anyway video cards VDS says hi
Greg do you still plan on doing the
small tech tuber channel review yes and
will be coming soon like I said in the
last livestream I'm pretty sure it takes
a while to get that video to get those
videos going because I have to pull
content from their channels and I have
to actually like come up with specific
instances in their videos in which I you
know really just like what they've done
so it's a lot of nitpicking to try to
show you guys the best of what they do
to reinforce my statement about them
being underrated and great tech channels
so you hear a scrolling down until OPS's
what are your thoughts on deviating I
think deleting is worth it for
you select CPUs not worth it for most
Greg anabolic SC says Greg what are your
thoughts on the new fractal design
define r6 I got a review of it on the
channel just type in define r6 science
studio you'll see it
let's see jared says real quick did
anyone else get an ADD of Allah I'm just
gonna keep scrolling where do I ask the
questions you asked him here skinwalker
with a three hey mod great job Greg I
made up for the 3.49 man I had to make
his tree fitty ah thanks Austin
I appreciate that dare me the crazy $2
donation says Joma fam squad rage OMA
Tech he's cool dome attack there I don't
know who he is I'll check it out after
this should I get a r5 2600 G or horizon
3 hamburger I'm thinking the rise in
three hamburger tech quarters I think
the hamburgers you can't really say no
to the hamburger yo daddy squiddy says
at science studio would you recommend a
gtx 770 for gigabyte for 120 at least
for right now that's a pretty good value
my dude that's not bad
770 I'd have to go back the four gig
buffer is pretty sweet so I would say
take it now but in terms of performance
770 like that awesome of a card but it's
still gonna be enough for now I hope
they go back and look I'm pretty sure
that thing's hovering around 1050 TI
territory if I'm not mistaken don't
quote me on that I gotta go back and
look let's see Intel ops I just answered
your question mr. KF gaming says here's
another $2 it's like tripping a strip
tipping a stripper all right well I'm
not stripping but if I was I would
appreciate the $2 donation and I don't
know what else do strippers do when they
get $2 donation the strippers give lap
dances for $2
no only if they're like changed or yeah
I'm you get a you get a kiss on the
cheek John why Oh John way Chu
how you say Xu in Chinese thanks true
thanks yeah
well I'm working on it men
worth saving for Rison plus for an i7
7700 9k user depends on what you're
doing for gaming the 7700 even non-case
still going to be perfectly fine for
gaming look if you switch to Rison plus
then you're gonna have you're gonna have
to swap motherboards and CPU so it's not
just the CPU cost you got to take any
consideration there so I would say stick
with the 7700 for now it's it's gonna be
perfectly fine I 770 700 K with single
GT X 1080 bottleneck or not no it's
gonna be a pretty balanced system in
some games your CPU will be the
bottleneck another game to attend a to
be a bottleneck that's inevitable but
that's a pretty good balanced system
right there when is this like the stupid
check keeps skipping past a bunch of
crap that I want to see yo Bo I see that
he's got he's got grapes
that's a Bojangles right there for you
it's got grapes watermelon what is this
a melon kiwi strawberry tomato avocado
you guys get the point he's feeling
really fruity right now that's what he's
trying to tell you I know he's laughing
right now I'm hearing me say that ok
there was one I wanted to see I wanted
to answer I saw something what am I
looking for
as a student dandiya such as a student
entering electrical engineering this
fall is it required that you be a
prodigy at math and is just a bachelor's
degree in engineering enough to get a
good job it's a really good question
actually I I almost want to do a full-on
video on that we're just gonna sit down
from the camera talk about it because a
lot of people are trying to figure out
whether or not they should enter the
engineering field in general and if it's
worth it if they'll have a job at the
end right the at least the US economy
kind of tipsy right now you're in
general tipsy too
and you know the math the side of
engineering can be pretty daunting I was
never the best at math I really wasn't I
came out of I came out of calculus 2
with a B I came out of calculus one with
an
eh only because I took it twice because
I took calculus from one in high school
and I got a B and then I failed the AP
exam because I didn't care about the AP
exam
I was yeah don't don't do that and then
my calculus - I got a B and that took
differential equations and I got an A in
that class surprisingly my first test in
differential equations I got an F on I
got a 50 one and I was so afraid I
thought I was gonna fail the class like
wow is my first test this is great it's
a great start but it really picked up I
watched a few youtubers checked channels
regarding math look the cool thing about
their channels they're gonna
perpetuating income for ever because
that math will never change right it's
not I guess where there's new tech
coming out our benchmarks now don't
really mean much a year from now so yeah
it keeps content flowing sure but his
videos on how to solve you know a two or
three step differential equation those
are gonna be solidified forever I mean
as long as we use that conventional math
system his videos are gonna perpetuate
forever because the laws never change
the rules of how to approach a problem
really never change and I think Patrick
jmt was the guy watched a lot he really
helped me get through math so if your
teachers your professors aren't really
helping you very much and you know you
kind of got to give him some slack
because they're teaching too usually a
class of 100 to 200 people if they're
not really doing you a service then just
learn it yourself that's what I did I
had my brother to help me my younger
brother by a year he's really good at
math he's actually getting his master's
right now in the same engineering he's
in petroleum engineering so I have my
bachelor's in petroleum he's getting his
master's right now on it and he will
graduate in December I'll graduate in
December with my master's in business
because business degrees at least from
my perspective or much easier than
engineering degrees so it was pretty
straightforward anyway sorry about that
really long explanation but yeah I
wouldn't be too afraid of of that at all
scrolling up here make sure they miss
anything
okay sorry you guys I'm trying to catch
up trying to catch up trying to catch up
how do you balance study life phase as
how do you balance your study life with
YouTube videos I don't know how I really
did that um any free time you have you
just have to devote to the channel I
never went out and partied in college I
really didn't at all guys can ask my
brother I mean my brother wasn't the
party type anyway but I would have been
more of the party type than him and even
I didn't because I preferred to make
youtube videos nothing made me happier
than seeing the view counts on my videos
go up and up and up and up that was my
motivation above all else let's see here
trucker bomb says for $2 which is better
strawberry or chocolate milk dude it's a
no-brainer
actually I'm a little conflicted because
strawberry is a better flavor overall in
my opinion but chocolate belongs in milk
so chocolate milk over strawberry milk
because with strawberry milk they just
put that like strawberry syrup in there
and it's just trash and milk for most
for the most part I know she's freaking
out I eat anything strawberry but if I
had a choice
chocolate milk is where it goes I know
she's freaking out and she's like what
the heck
someone asks Frederick Strom born asks
what is the heart of a computer if we
define heart I'm just kidding alright so
a heart right pumps blood everywhere
else without the heart nothing works
the body technically without a brain
would still work it just wouldn't have
motor functions or anything like that
but it would have muscle spasms
everything right the heart keeps the
body alive and without the heart you
have you have no flow you have no like
current so you see where I'm going with
this the power supply is the heart of
the computer because without the power
supply the computer will never run you
could have the most expensive hardware
you could have the the beefiest muscles
and the most tuned brain imaginable but
if you don't have anything powering the
brain aka a supply of red blood to the
brain which is that supply of oxygen
then you have no PC so I would say that
the power supply is the heart of the
computer and the CPU is the brain all
right I am scrolling down here JSON
eight dollars and seventeen cents don't
I don't know what I'm going to do with
the change like I'm really curious
see what it change gonna be like you
know this video you guys are donating
some really weird figures but I
appreciate that $8 and 17 cent donation
my man with this enough for a gram of
your swab stance did I say that
correctly I hope I hope I pronounce
those words accurately lol take my money
alright yeah sure I'll do that it's
pretty easy to take those money
no but seriously thank you for these
donations I really appreciate it I don't
livestream usually with the expectation
of getting a lot of donations from these
things in fact most streams I'll come
out with like 20 bucks total and
donations but I really appreciate this
you guys I'm trying my best to answer
both questions that aren't donations and
those are I feel like those that are
donating deserve to have their questions
answered but any of you guys really
watching the stream desert and deserve
to have your answers questions so I'm
really trying here to get to this stuff
so just bear with me
try not to spam don't spam the chat I
will get to it I promise
let's see t does gaming says should I
get a 1060 wait for him videos new cards
this year wait right now I mean if you
don't need a new card right now just
just chill because the 1060 s are still
overpriced it's pretty ridiculous best
laptop you suggest for college depends
on what you're doing if you're just a
business major get like a freaking
Chromebook and I'm just kidding you you
just need something to use Microsoft
Word for write and Excel and PowerPoint
and then maybe Xtreme and browse the web
that's it then you could get a $300
laptop and call it a day but if you're
doing some you know rendering if you're
an engineering major or chemist or a
physicist you gotta run simulations then
getting like a true quad-core CPU that's
not an Intel Atom processor is
recommended so any true aquatic we're
out there any HQ processor usually is
what you want so and scrolling down
scrolling down scrolling down scrolling
down we're gonna be doing this for maybe
another ten minutes or so because I want
to play some games after this and I'll
tell you guys what's gonna happen with
that if you want to keep watching
scrolling down here scrolling down
scrolling down scrolling up going down
I'm sorry I feel bad for scrolling do
all these questions
okay mode Salman says Greg how do you
tell your crush you love her scared oh
you know how you tell your crush you
love her you tell her you love her my
babe yeah yeah you just you just got a
man up say it I didn't really do that no
I did I know oh yeah I did I told her
that yeah yeah I told her I told her
first and I loved her yeah see you boy
but my dude fifty dollars why are you
crazy
I hope you know you can't take that
money back I don't want you to regret
that that's a lot of money man fifty
bucks
holy Jebus and all you said was so
Raphael I appreciate that
immensely but that was um
that was certainly not right that was
that was not you know you didn't have to
do that thank you for that that is
insane you guys are awesome
Frederick Strom born our Stormborn sorry
I mispronounced your name last time well
said thank you for that I thank you for
the question it's really cool I like
thinking outside the box like that like
it's the power supply what is that like
the heart it's a brain or a nervous
system what is it that's really cool
James DiMaggio a $4 and $0.99 Oh mate is
it did YouTube change the way that they
donated Alec is it just all bike have to
end in 99 cents no nothing not getting
five dollars exactly bothers me but it's
just really funny because all of you
were donating like weird like figures
that are ending in some really strange
sense like what's going on James
DiMaggio says $4.99 I appreciate that
donation if your option on the math vid
if that's your option on the math video
try a video on a theory or concept for
computers like there once between
viruses and malware yeah that's true
dude
yeah and that is so I think that's less
that's that's gonna stick less than math
will because the malware viruses like
the general knowledge sure that'll stick
but I think there's less people
searching for that for one so you'll
have you know you know I think you'll
have a more steady stream of viewers if
you stick with them with a math based
topic
because malware and viruses while those
general like principles will remain the
same for the foreseeable future I don't
think that I don't think as many people
are gonna want to know the difference I
don't know I can make a video on and see
how many people like it but you're right
I mean to an extent like that would be I
don't know that that would be something
to consider so yeah I think I think
you're right let's see here scrolling
did - down someone else's I have trucker
bomb as you $6 and 66 that donation GPU
prices as high as they'll be or still
going up I don't think they're gonna go
much higher don't quote me on that but
I'm I'm not expecting them to go much
higher than they already are
just because if they go any higher
I lean the thing miners you're gonna
want to frankly miners are willing to
pay for them because they expect of
return right but with how up and down
the cryptocurrency market is right now
the exchange and just you know overnight
a think and plummet and you lose all all
the money you had invested I don't think
people are willing to spend that much
more on graphics cards for even mining
and I've been wrong but if I was getting
into it I'd be okay with these prices I
wouldn't pay 600 bucks for a 1060 not
for that mega hash Balad thing no way
that's just me let's scrolling down dude
did you have to beat your girl and see
us go to win her heart
no like that was the requirement thin I
would not be with her right now
no I can't I can't do it let's see
you're scrolling at roughly $50 - are
you crazy
we're app yellows donated $100 in the
matter of 30 seconds and I don't know
why he's all of that entertaining but
thank you I don't say I wish I could do
you a solid take you out for a drink or
something but that's insane thank you
no GP prices will reduce a bit if
theorem isn't going to use proof of work
forever yeah I mean I don't expect it to
go up very much at all from this point
like I was just saying I think it's
gonna it's gonna stay pretty consistent
for the most part I think when miners
start selling off their cards and mass
quantities then the
graphics card suppliers are gonna see a
pretty big drop in sales not just
because their prices are gonna drop and
as a consequence they're gonna drop
those and might start to tease even
further but also because many people
aren't gonna want to buy brand new cards
when they can just get a used one for
you know 100 or 200 bucks off MSRP which
which is what I would do even though
they were used for mining you know and
running 24/7 whatever those cards can
handle that I mean if you think about it
yeah putting them under stress 24/7 is
intense that heat that buildup can cause
some issues but I'd be willing to take
that risk for the sake of saving a
hundred bucks or $200 because worst-case
you just get another used one and then
you're back up to the regular MSRP and
that's if the the lifespan of that card
has been cut in half since it started
mining which I doubt let's see but thank
you for that donation again I appreciate
it from one to ten how good rise in two
will be relative to rise in one okay
so it's like if one means that it's the
same as risin one and ten means it's
like 10 times better than risin 1 I
think it's gonna be like I don't know
it's kind of like hard how do you scale
that any performance wise it's gonna be
about 1 point 1 to 1.5 times better so
and not even that it's not gonna be 1.5
times but it'll be like 1.15 times
better it would be the max I would ever
see a gain just from raw compute power
in arisin plus CPU so I think the
questions a bit flawed my dude but you
know I don't know maybe you guys asked
some really weird questions but they're
kind of cool cuz I have to really think
outside the box here you get Dogon asked
what's your blood type
I actually don't know I got I drew blood
I donated blood in high school and they
gave me a car at a donor card and they
didn't have my blood type on it it was
blank literally everyone else had blood
types but mine was blank
so maybe I'm like an alien let's see
where my scrolling is TV good for 3d
modelling a television I mean yeah I
guess so unless you see some purpose
some application for a high refresh rate
monitor I don't know why you would want
such a big screen now unless you have no
choice but to go with a TV if it's 32
inches or smaller then you'll be okay a
bigger
screen and that's gonna be really weird
3d modeling you're gonna have to go to
all different sorts of corners right you
have to look totally left and totally
right if that TV is like within two or
three feet of you just to access a menu
so take that into account
do you have any interest in coding
Jeremy winters says or asks I I do I
mean I would like to know how to do all
of that but I think that that stuff is
just beyond me at this point I would
have to really and literally start from
scratch and I don't know I don't think I
could really I'd have to really apply
myself and right now while I'm in school
and doing this full-time I don't think I
have enough time anywhere to sit down
and do that I want to learn German first
before I do anything else so I've got a
jump on that she's looking at me like
yeah I haven't even started yet sorry I
know the audio is kind of low cuz I
backed away from the mic The Wanderer
5:21 says question prevention and
Effects of condensation inside the PC
fins of my exhaust fan at the back has
traces of water smears or moisture not
much I would like to know why that
happened is it just from the ambient
like they had just the atmosphere that
was just pulling in water vapor do you
have like a humidifier something in your
house why would you have water filled
out unless you have a custom loop you
have a leak that's a different story
but that shouldn't happen normally I
would be slightly concerned clean that
up you don't wanted to actually you know
condense and spill into your power
supply or something it could be pretty
bad how much would it cost to build a
decent gaming PC Chris Chris that is
relative that's totally relative what is
decent to you is decent 1080p 120 Hertz
gaming or is it 4k 120 Hertz gaming
what's decent let's see here I'm gonna
answer about two more Alex Cruz says
this is a comment I see that thanks for
that cool continent Oh what have we got
here Aaron Lettie says single eye 9
build or two i7 builds for streaming
1080p hmm you could stream 1080p with a
single eyes
I mean I don't know why you would want
to go with two unless you just want the
overkill factor in which case just go
with the i9 then you're gonna pay a
thousand bucks if you think about it
two i7s if you could like reap the
benefits of like fully of two i7 8700 KS
or 700 bucks or so MSRP then that would
totally crush an i-9 in almost every
scenario but I don't really see how you
would be able to benefit from two i7s
for streaming 1080p anyway because you
would use i7s right just by themselves
singular on mainstream motherboards
interesting question let's see one more
