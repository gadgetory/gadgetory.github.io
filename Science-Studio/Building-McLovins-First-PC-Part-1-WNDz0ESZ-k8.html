building a PC for McLovin who was the
cameraman in one of the latter videos
you can check out right here
now his channel is gonna be revolving
around this is uh I don't know I'm not a
motorcycle pro what is it Jacob what's
my bike alrighty there Mather the 2007
zx-10r a little bit sketchy can't really
read the license plate but you know what
we're going with it hard he done now
yeah anyway
alright so that's what his channel will
be revolving around him riding on a
motorcycle talking about random stuff
whatever's crossing his mind that
particular day but he's going to eat an
editing rig to handle all of that fancy
footage and all of that interesting
audio that you've just got a sample of
and so we've decided hook him up with
the $350 and EPC build that you can
check out right here by the way the
video which we covered earlier on on the
channel if you are a little skeptical
about that pcs ability to edit footage
and render footage
I'm skeptical too we hooked them up
already we've got it all assembled but
we have footage that we want to show you
it's going to be divvied up into a
couple parts because we have quite a lot
of footage being that Michael Evans
going to be the cameraman it's a lot to
sift through so bear with us anyway
enjoy part 1 and stay tuned for parts 2
&amp;amp; 3 they'll be right here if they aren't
right now
I was reading some of the reviews are
like pyramid ships you can't even hold
the camera straight I was like umm what
is that
that's your computer it's not complete
I'm gonna trash it in the video oh my
god Greg can be fine dude are you
serious you're gonna be fine this looks
like somebody else built in like 1990
okay the kinds of edits you're gonna be
doing your channel are going to be like
what is this well that that's the old
power supply we're replacing that we're
replacing this whole thing we want to
Best Buy and buy another one okay unless
you want this but I don't recommend it
cuz it's old
I'm gonna fail any minute now look look
at that oh yeah mmm
without looks awful oh my god it looks
great shout out to AMD for super awesome
cover for their PC everything about this
just looks so old like it's like oh yeah
that's really nice lucky that's why I'm
giving you this
please don't sweat this time okay I was
hard dude oh so hot in here
oh my goodness this is absolutely
ridiculous Greg it's gonna look fine
look look at the vibrant color color you
got here we are painting this thing ASAP
what do you want to paint it we can't
paint really anything Monster Energy
they will just spray paint we get but we
can paint them we can't spray paint them
mother Oh we'll spray paint the
motherboard we can but I have induction
is gonna be great I don't know why I did
this
that ramp this ramp that's right I
wasn't good call
oh yeah plugging all kinds of things
from the other board and I just pulled
those out for some reason it like okay
so let's like let's look at this one
okay it's like wow looks super old look
at that difference
oh my goodness look how nice that looks
are you willing to spend $1,500 no okay
do you see the car I Drive Greg look at
this living zooming out on the karna
Greg you see that look at that look at
that TDI mmm 55 miles per gallon I think
so
oh yeah I didn't even know
a turbocharger in it because it doesn't
do anything oh it's probably smaller
than this this looks like complete
overkill / it is complete overkill its
own bad its complete overkill now this
whole this whole rig doesn't make any
sense at all we're gonna put an N Z XC
cracking x61 alright a water loop that
costs twice as much as this entire like
setup right here does to cool a CP that
we can't even overclocked okay it
doesn't make any sense at all it's just
gonna be quiet that's pretty much it
okay we're gonna put this in this case
so this is kind of just it's not
necessary but it kind of keeps
everything and laid out oh yeah I
also stole two of your LED fans because
I want those so what they're gone
why did you do that there no cuz I
wanted well obviously I need all that
wind power for how overheating this
thing's about a baby you see this great
this thing looks like it's just gonna
catch on fire we're literally just gonna
plug it in it's gonna go like
spontaneously catch on fire we'll just
jam it in there Greg together oh you oh
god why don't we what the thing was
resting against the back so I saw that
thermal paste right there so we go whose
fault was that Greg was fun sports but
it's just gonna be sitting alright
twisted like that I'm be surprised this
pump even works after this okay yeah
whatever yeah I guess see that anyway
I'm gonna see that okay now I'm bothered
me knowing it's there I mean I guess it
kind of looks retro which is cool in a
way but at the same time it looks so
stupid I don't recommend playing games
on this PC I'm definitely not look out
look at this craftsmanship oh my
goodness it says oh yeah so you never
know someone might want
oh no I actually bought that case of my
own money believing that I thought I'd
look cool I realize old were you like 12
no I was actually 20 good car Greg what
are you doing you just break something
off already I pulled off the entire CPU
came out of the socket I pulled off the
cooler it won't even come well we got
thermal paste on it now this lutely this
got thermal paste yeah this thermal
paste it's just it wasn't supposed to do
that I'm surprised it didn't Bend anyway
pan so let's see get all really close up
on that see if we getting bent pins are
you are you okay
wow wow that is like yeah that's a great
shot just just hold it
still so it will focus yeah there yeah
there you go
how are we looking it looks like we
don't have any bent pins organization is
essential for every build unless you're
greg at science studio just all
discombobulated just look at that I
think that's fairly organized okay yeah
that's what you want people things in
reality that's just a cluster
I appreciate these were wrong screws to
hold this end yeah no I guess we don't
need it then do you know okay all right
that one's not going any further if you
leave it what no it's just got stuck you
guys dug like halfway down there we're
gonna like go to pick this up and it's
just gonna pull everything down now when
only one halfway into we're just gonna
leave it
we'll make sure it doesn't jiggle and
wiggle no it's fine
oh yeah Greg it's not going anyone right
it's okay as you awkwardly like pick it
up and move it we don't have a micro
Center anywhere close to Panama City so
what that means is we have to resort to
drastic measures aka best buy supplies
with the remaining components can't wait
to spend a lot of money on probably
cheap parts well honestly it's just
gonna depend on what you want um folks
have been telling him because he's gonna
be mainly using this PC it obviously
it's nothing powerful you're gonna be
using it for obviously for Justin or his
new YouTube channel yeah it is uh now
pull up okay yep I got it I bring up at
the CPU in the socket am-2 plus socket
got it got it all right align the Golden
Arrow right there with the arrow on the
socket itself boom CP is installed oh he
said was I want like four second exactly
I'll lift this up I don't know what that
oh whoops
the brackets falling off the best I
could bracket out of the back on your
motherboard
ah it's fresh
what no if it did or not I'm just saying
it's glass and that's metal so that's
possible
well you just fight know what's coming
up I can do oh this is oh yeah pressure
to take them back
yeah probably shut up well animals crush
you right oh yeah those look expensive
yeah that's a surprise agree like look
at this even allowed to touch these yeah
and I supposed to be wearing socks on
carpet no you're not dude I don't know
how am I supposed to you know your
makeup huh oh I'm gonna pick that up bro
he's got that dumb look on his face -
she doesn't though it looks so cool
looks looks complete overkill someone
asked me oh yeah it's overkill for sure
okay
well now this is the most illogical bill
this is probably one of those builds
that you would see like being made fun
of
unlike Tom's Hardware but we're actually
taking well I'm taking this seriously
Greg might not uh yeah I'm completely
I'm not taking this seriously at all hmm
seems like I'm missing a fan here the
Reg like you're missing a fan right
there clearly I mean yeah I just
straight stole it it's not there I need
all these fans Craig you clearly that
thing's gonna overheat oh yeah
that Rams probably gone don't thing is
like your graphics cards clearly not
gonna be long enough to make use of this
uh doesn't even what that is this is to
support your graphics try to keep it
like upright yeah it definitely does not
look like it's gonna be actually it
doesn't even aligned with the PCIe slot
on here like even if you had a card that
was this long it wouldn't be supported
like so it doesn't even matter we do
need to install hard drive and then
we'll need to go purchase your power
supply your graphics card and hopefully
a solid-state drive at Best Buy has
someone
and then be good to go pretty much
coverage that okay off the best buy move
that's fine turn up get it come with me
actually I need some socks stay tuned
for part two of Michael Evans PC
building experience I think this you're
gonna succeeded time in this cars like
13 seconds 13 I get smoked by like semi
trucks uh let me get that lunch pop let
me get that french fry medium french
fried pop Oh that'll do er all right
thank you so much oh yeah oh yeah second
year pole straining yeah come on tour
that life no why why
alright back the good old best buy right
Jacob love that smell
alright ah ya know what that one okay
this I also have an EVGA superclocked
that's pretty cool yep still not
tempting now all this is like what he
does I ride motorcycles and drive cars
oh I guess I'd need a psycho because we
live that way we live over there she
enjoyed that
you know she enjoyed that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
