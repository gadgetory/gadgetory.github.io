honestly has multiple answers depending
on the kind of person you are how
patient you can be where you live and
your surrounding market for how much
should I sell my PC I'm making this
video for one specific reason and that's
because it seems like after every
Craigslist video airs in this channel I
get several people asking how much they
should be selling their pcs for and for
one I don't know where you live so if
you live outside the US I have no idea
how those markets look I don't know what
you should expect to pay new for for
said components or said build and let
alone used I don't know how your use
market is at all there are several
factors to consider we're game we're
gonna cover those in this video
but for one if you look outside the US
there's really no point asking me what
you should sell your PC for because I
have no idea what your foreign market
looks like as for US sellers it's still
not a black-and-white answer because
someone in upstate New York might be
able to get way more for their new
system than someone in say Southern
California so yeah again it's not black
and white and I'm gonna seek to cover
the variables to consider in this video
of course their iron claw RGB wireless
sports a custom 18,000 dpi picsArt
sensor which you can adjust and get this
one DPI increments along with 50 million
click tried-and-true Omron switches use
a 10 built-in buttons to fully customize
your gaming experience and enjoy
beautiful zone RGB lighting for a fresh
aesthetic in any setup grab an iron claw
to be Wireless today from your favorite
retailer via the links below so let's
throw it a hypothetical and will assess
its viability through several different
pretext also we're going to assume that
you're selling in the US market although
you should be able to extend these
principles across to pretty much any
developed countries market so first up
here's our hypothetical I want to assume
that the seller in question has a modest
bill let's say it's a locked 6 gen core
i5 build with a stock cooler a gtx 1066
gig 8 gigs of ram 500 watt psu 500 gig
SSD and an NZXT s340 if i went and found
all of these parts on say ebay what do
you think i could build it for now i
know it wasn't super specific on the
parts used like 500 SSD 5 and what
powers play that's not you know enough
it's not what I would expect to find and
a Craigslist said I want specific
components so I can actually gotten
priceless out but let's assume I did
that and I found from reputable sellers
all the parts and I could build this
exact system for 500 USD so that's not
bad and look this system could play
pretty much anything in 1080p I'm not
saying you get 144fps out of it under
all circumstances especially from newer
titles we are going to be limited to an
extent with the quad-core @xu from our
core i5 but it's a decent system again
for 500 bucks so does that mean then
that the seller should ask 500 USD for
his or her system on say eBay or
Craigslist the answer is no it's your
job as the seller to be greedy now out
on Greg you're always harping on these
craigslist ads these people asking way
too much money that doesn't make any
sense why would you tell people to do
exactly what you preach against in your
craigslist series and okay first off 500
bucks obverse $600 is nowhere near
worthy of a dedicated Crysis video in
science studio I'm not sure about other
channels out there but I'd say 600 bucks
is a decent
starting point and look you shouldn't go
into this expecting to get exactly what
you asked for
expect some haggle that's the joy of the
used market it's fun and if both sides
come out a little disappointed then it
was a good deal overall on top of that
asking 600 bucks for a $500 system or a
thousand dollars for an $800 system heck
or even three thousand dollars for a
$600 system like none of that is a crime
it's the sellers job to maximize profit
and obviously three thousand dollars for
a second dollar system is a bit
outrageous and that might make its way
into a Craigslist video here on this
channel but again there's nothing
illegal going on there
I would never fall someone from making a
ton of money on a sale unless they use
some deceptive ploy or mislead the buyer
when that sale occurred at which point I
would call you you know a few names most
of the craigslist ads i feature on this
channel packed two key elements an
insanely high asking price and
overconfidence the seller either over
inflates the performance metrics or
ridicules potential buyers maybe even
both but that in combination with high
asking price is just a bit ridiculous to
me by asking $1000 though for a $500
system and then just listing specs
that's not really much to critique I
mean in terms of price yeah I can run
through each of the components and say
this is worth a lot less but that would
make for a fairly boring video and I
would almost even argue that if the
seller sells that said $500 system for
$1000 that the buyer probably deserved
to be scammed because it's the buyers
job to do due diligence investigate the
prices of use components in order to
make an informed purchase decision if
you're not going to buy new and expect
retailers to price things fairly then
you take that burden upon yourself as
the buyer in the used market to do the
research if you're uncomfortable with
this task or you're just too lazy or
maybe just don't know how to research
effectively in your market at this point
I would almost always encourage you to
buy new and this ties in to my second
point no two markets are the same
I could sell our $500 NZXT system in
Florida for 600 bucks whereas in
California that same system might sell
for 550 or 540 it all depends on the
availability of parts and used market
saturation if several people are selling
similar respect systems and they're all
independent
each other and there might be a fair
degree of competition and prices might
be driven a bit lower that's good for
the buyer I can say that as a Florida
resident there aren't too many places to
buy new components save Best Buy and
Best Buy is kind of a stretch there I
mean sometimes they have decent stock of
especially peripherals but maybe not
CPUs or graphics cards and other times
they have absolutely nothing or totally
out of stock of those components so Best
Buy is not a very reliable place I would
say to buy most of your components
although it is an option and probably
one of the only options if you do live
in Florida we used to have a tigerdirect
here I believe we don't have any micro
centers I think the closest one is in
Atlanta that's a five-hour drive for me
and about a 15 hour drive from Miami so
this particular situation might drive
the prices of used components up right
because the availability of new
components is rather low it's all simple
supply and demand economics I'm not
gonna bother you only get all that in
this video but you should know that the
supply of something is low then the
price is generally going to go up in
response now my third point has to do
with patience how long are you willing
to sit on a build or component as the
seller so if you're looking to move
inventory fairly quick you might want to
sell your PC for five hundred and twenty
bucks or five hundred and thirty bucks
maybe even exactly what you paid for it
five hundred dollars right in this
context that's okay if you want to just
move through components and try out new
things that's a totally viable practice
in fact that's what I did as a young
science to do Channel about two or three
years ago when I was in college that was
the only way for me to move through
inventory without having to shell out
tons of money and never really see any
of that returned save subscribers and
viewership which at that point was not
really funding much at all so in the
good old days yeah that was how I always
had new components on hand because I was
willing to buy parts and build systems
sell them on Craigslist again for most
of the time small markups I think the
first build I sold for 550 and it cost
me 500 the next build was about 600
dollars and I sold that for pretty sure
I broke even on that one and I started
to learn the market right and this goes
back to the the fact that every market
is going to be slightly different
RGB was a big thing back then and still
is today I mean it's even bigger I would
argue now so that was something I tried
to include in most of my builds again I
always
turned that into the budget and I
expected to get small returns on that
but sometimes I did have to break even
now other times I made huge profits I've
made 150 bucks I think on one sale it
was a six hundred and fifty dollar
system
I still do free and Radames does that
make me a greedy person yeah did I just
call myself greedy yeah but not in a
ridiculing sort of way and more or less
kind of making light of the situation
the fact is sellers are supposed to
maximize profit does that make you a bad
person absolutely not not in my book
buyers are supposed to be frugal you're
supposed to save as much money as
possible does that make you a bad person
absolutely not
are you a bad person for low-balling
somebody no unless it's an insanely low
lowbal like if it's a thousand dollar
system used and you offer two hundred
bucks for it you probably deserve to be
called you know an a-hole but if you
offer something like $800 for the
thousand dollar system there's nothing
wrong with that even if the buyer excuse
me the seller says firm one thousand
dollars no less you can still offer less
because they'll probably take less nine
times out of ten they'll probably take a
little less than their firm bottom
dollar
now while sellers can be scumbags in the
sense that they can over inflate and and
I overhyped their builds it's a 4k 60fps
gaming PC all around but it actually has
a core i3 and a gtx 750ti in it you know
I'm talking about we see a few of those
on the channel right now and then the
buyer could also be scumming
in the sense that the buyer could let's
say show up to the public place where
you're supposed to exchange the PC for
the money let's say you agreed on 550
bucks and then the buyer says oh I only
have 450 bucks in my pocket looks like
yeah we're just gonna have to do 450
instead no that's just you being a
scumbag if you gave your word to the
seller over a certain price and then you
showed up with less than that
conveniently then you're just being
scumbag and at that point if I was a
seller I would just walk away you're not
worth my time blacklist a number and
ever deal with that person ever again do
the right thing and if you agree on
something in text it's just good
practice to follow through you're not
contractually bound to that you're not
gonna at least in my opinion be sued for
something like that that would be a
little insane if everyone was sued for
lying there would be lawsuits all over
the place and they're kind of autumn but
you know
it's just the us but yeah don't be a
scumbag if you're gonna buy something
and you agree on a price over text bring
that money with you don't try to haggle
last minute like show up with less money
in your pocket or some BS it's just not
worth it if you're gonna pay something
agree to pay it over text over the phone
show up get the exchange done with and
move on okay it's this it's not worth it
like that 50 bucks you might save is
just not worth it you're gonna probably
end up walking away with nothing seller
so this happens to you walk away it's
worth it looking you got one guy I
already meet you for that sale at that
agreed price you'll probably find
someone else in the area to do it who's
not gonna be as scummy
but all right that's how I want to close
this one I'm not gonna tell each and
every wannabe how much you should sell
your pcs for so yeah stop asking not
trying to be rude but I can't tell you
because for what I don't know where you
live I don't know your market I don't
have the time to research your local
Craigslist and see what other people are
asking for their parts and monitor
whether or not they're actually selling
those goods for those asking prices I
have no idea there's no way I could log
all of that I just know my area in
particular if someone lives around me
and asked me that's a different story
but I'd rather it be personal and not
via facebook Messenger or Twitter or
something else but again I want to
re-emphasize the fact that as the seller
it is your job to maximize profit if you
are selling a system don't ask what you
think it's worth from use parts alone
ask a little more than that you need a
starting point if you expect people to
haggle it would be dumb to start at the
place that breaks you even consider this
let's say you have one offer for your 5
meter dollar system at 600 bucks and
another offer for $700 maybe you told
both of them that you had two different
offers for the same price right and one
of them said well screw it if he's only
offering 600 bucks I'll offer 700 for
which takes $700 you would be crazy not
to take $700 for that PC does that make
you a bad person absolutely not should
you choose the $600 offer because you'd
feel bad if you took the $700 offer no
that's like get that out of your mind
that's not a good way to approach
business at all it's not a good way to
approach life in general maximize profit
there's nothing wrong with that you're
being greedy yeah but in the use market
you kind of have to be there's a lot of
competition there's a lot of scumbags
out there you don't know how to navigate
the waters hope this video helps you
