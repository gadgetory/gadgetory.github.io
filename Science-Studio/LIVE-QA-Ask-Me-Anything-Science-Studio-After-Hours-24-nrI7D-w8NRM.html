for the short delay on that one
I see I'm trying to set up both these
I've streaming this PC majority of the
time we host these these after our
streams but there are a few instances in
which I need to stream in the other room
and not everything syncs perfectly I use
stream labs for that's why you see all
these fancy things going on like I don't
know how to do most of this in OBS and
you can import a lot of that from stream
labs but I just use a I just use stream
labs itself because it's got a decent UI
and I've gotten familiar with it
recently so that's why I'm doing what
I'm doing I apologize it doesn't look
super crispy I mean this isn't a super
professional live stream by any means
it's not meant to be it's more or less
me just hopping in front of a webcam and
asking you good people while not asking
you questions I mean waiting for you
good people to ask me questions and
hopefully under the answer or I can kind
of set you in the right direction and if
I don't then this is the time for me to
go do my research possibly even make a
video about the subject because if you
don't know it and I don't know it that's
that's an opportunity you know to
possibly bring something the forefront a
forefront most people you know have a
general understanding of things but how
things work on a technical level that's
all stuff I like to learn about I take a
lot of time I used to take a lot more
time to dive into the really dense
subjects and try to animate them and
premiere and stuff to help better
explain them anyway I'll stop babbling
so what's going on folks just here
waiting to answer questions that you
guys have this is something we do every
Sunday night or Monday morning Monday
afternoon depend on where you live on
the planet where I sit in front and
answer questions that you guys have for
all of me
let's see Edvin says did you play
blackout yet and do you like it I
haven't played it yet I'm assuming black
ops I haven't played it yet a few
friends are trying to get me into the
open beta but I've heard it's actually
really good which is a I mean that's a
good thing for the cod series it needs
to be revived you found I think you know
the Battle Royale games definitely took
off and they've picked up on some of
those cues and that's good
I like to see stuff like that so
hopefully they do really well here very
soon
let's see here bazinga XO 10 mil a super
chat I think you might dude good to see
you again bazinga I think the dad of the
guy on that verge video should have
gotten them I'm not gonna read them but
everyone else can read that I appreciate
your support and for stopping by again
I'm not gonna get too into the personal
stuff I didn't want it to be a personal
attack on anybody in that video although
I did take a couple jabs at the producer
of The Verge who decided to I don't know
expose himself as a person who doesn't
bleep tech tubers or journalists which I
mean if you look at journalism from a
very broad perspective a journalism it's
the idea of reporting on something that
happens if you're a tech journalist then
you report on live events on things
related to tech that are pertinent to
your audience that they're relevant and
they're kind of like we used to have all
these assignments I'm were way back in
fifth grade when I was like 10 years old
we had an assignment every Friday I had
to turn in to my professor a is called a
current event and you had to go online
and print a news article from any
website you wanted any you know
quote-unquote
reliable news source that's up to your
discretion and write a synopsis of it
little one paragraph
you know essay of sorts kind of just
summarizing it talking about why it was
unique what the perspective of the
author was and just trying to you know
analyze the inherent bias if there was
any and pick up on the on the trends so
you know even that to an extent like you
you know you're using sources of course
to kind of report your own things
they're not necessarily primary sources
but I just thought it was kind of a lame
attempt at a jab towards detect I mean
look not all tech tubers are journalists
I don't think that he really meant to
say it like that though I think he was
just trying to take a jab at our entire
system here people that have been doing
this way longer than I have
I'm sure took that personally and it
just didn't come across right so he he
either could have worded it better or
just shouldn't have said anything at all
I think was really stupid remark
and that's why I took a jab it in there
but look the the Builder you know Stefan
Stefan blocked me I don't know stiff
I've never talked to the guy I've never
said a single word to him in person via
chat Twitter or whatever and I said in
the video I said look I don't know how
hands-on this guy was with the with the
verge PC built now the issue I had with
what he was doing not necessarily I mean
the stuff that he did in the video was
coolly wrong
but he tried to kind of just brush it
aside and and come up with excuses and
his subsequent teeth tweets related to
that video um and it just seemed like he
was trying to cover him you know just
trying to cover it up and I didn't like
that you know you screw up you do
something wrong and a majority of a
particular fan base or community points
it out that's that's like the ultimate
sign that you screwed up something and
that you need to just fess up to it and
correct it either in a subsequent video
or by deleting the previous video he
probably doesn't have any control over
that though so that's kind of why I
tried to leave him out of it the
personal attacks I think on him and you
know if you're just joking that's fine
but it doesn't make any sense going
after him if he's not the one who
ultimately controlled the production of
the video although I did look up his
name on verges website and apparently he
scripts stuff he's like the the tech
news scripter so maybe he was more
hands-on than I thought either way you
guys saw the video and I'm sure you saw
either my video or Kyle's video or any
of the other ones reacting to that
abomination of a guy that was the big
problem I had with it was they trying to
pass it off as though it was a guide
when in reality I mean it was it was a
just a catastrophe because they pointed
out so many things that were
inconsistent flawed inherently wrong
straight-up incorrect or you're just
given PC builders the wrong impression
and I don't want anyone to have to you
know I don't even have to fix those
things by saying hey don't watch that
video watch this video instead but I
felt like it was necessary because they
tried to pass it off as a tutorial if
they had just said look this is how we
build a PC that's what they said in the
title this is how we built the PC for
$2000 something along those lines and
that's cool
but the you know the host tried to make
it seem as though he was teaching us how
to build a PC and if you're going to
teach somebody how to do something you
better know how to do it yourself
otherwise it's gonna look really bad on
you oh and the company you're
representing and the sponsor right so
Capital One already paid the bill for
that video you know they they got paid
probably thousands of dollars for that
video but they can't delete that video
because it's in a contract you know it's
a Capital One pays for it straight up
that's it Capital One takes on the risk
of that video being successful
successful or not
and that's the end of it you know like I
have videos that I have contracted with
companies in the past you guys see all
the pre rules and stuff like that that
that all has to stay up there you know I
can't go back and manually delete those
videos because they're counting on that
book that recurring viewership for those
videos on the channel so you know asking
them to take it down I think I think we
know why they won't it's they probably
would have if they hadn't had a sponsor
like Capital One in the video but then
that makes them look bad from the
standpoint that well they had Capital
One a big sponsor support a video that
is inherently flawed
so that's another issue you know but
then then you have ask yourself well do
you how do you how do you fix that and
you break the contract
you know maybe return the funds delete
the video start over again maybe work
out some new agreement with the company
I don't really know I've never been in
that situation hopefully I never am but
it just wasn't good from any angle
anyway I'm gonna stop talking about that
you guys again can watch those videos
for more context but I'm going to scroll
back up here missed a couple of super
chests first truck brawl think of it
that $5 super chat truck or bomb I was
at my croissant and they had I counted
23 8th gen hexa-core Intel CPUs how'd
they get them wasn't it funny lady made
it seem like like it was some super rare
chip like I wanted to comment on that
more not in the in the video that's kind
of why I was like oh yeah oh yeah you
got that you got that 8 quart you know
six core chip don't you but not too far
into but you guys knew what I was
getting at it was just a little it
looked a little too for some czar
let's say you hammer down the brace and
you guys are savage you guys call us
savage studio over here but you guys are
pretty savage yourselves let's see mr.
KF gaming what's going on my dude thank
you for stuff well I can't say
sponsoring anymore because you're
actually just a channel member now they
change the name of the role but thank
you for being a channel member I
appreciate your continued support get
that sexy looking yellow battery that
will soon be green my friend Greg what's
your take on Edie having most of his
stuff taken due to robbery a good
question so here's my take on that you
know ed and I have very very tiny
history not all of it was particularly
friendly but I don't have any ill-will
against the guy it sucks that he lost
all of that stuff although I will say in
hindsight and it's 20/20 I'll admit that
I mean that guy had no insurance and
that's I mean when you have a 30,000
plus dollar camera just a camera worth
that much it's worth more than many
people's cars you gotta have insurance
on it
I mean that that to me is just that's
that's business 101 and you know just
like you have to legally have insurance
to drive a car you should have to have I
mean it should be automatic to get
insurance on something that costs that
much whether you paid for it or not you
know however you can't account for
inventory you need to have that stuff
covered because if people know you have
all that gear and they find out where
you work and they're not so clean you
know with their criminal background then
that that to me is I mean you're just
asking for it and in a city like LA
where crime is rather high all big
cities have those issues I just it sucks
I feel bad for the guy who really do I
just hope that you know next thing he
does once you get some of this stuff
back ensures it you know get insurance
because you never know I mean that's why
they call it insurance you're covered
just in case something goes wrong and it
sucks that he has to experience this
firsthand to realize how important it is
I'm sure he just beat himself up for it
now you know but uh yeah it's
it's unfortunate that's a lot of that's
a lot of gear I mean that's that's just
the camera alone 30 grand he probably
lost I don't know he you know upwards of
eighty to a hundred K worth of stuff
that's that's insane even even if he
didn't pay I mean let's assume he got
half of it from companies directly right
for review or usin videos product
placement whatever that's still a lot of
inventory to have to recoup later on you
know don't even look at it from a
financial standpoint that's a lot of
stuff to just replace period so I
couldn't imagine I don't have anywhere
near as much gear as that does but I
couldn't imagine losing two or three pcs
and you know six processors and three
graphics cards like that would be a huge
hit on my inventory so you know haven't
replaced that much more that that's just
got to be a pain so yeah I wish the guy
all the best look I have know it well
like I said and hopefully he gets back
up soon you know he's still producing
videos I just I know it's gotta suck and
I have all of the equipment you're used
to using to film so see let's see here
neo blue at science to do this is a
really cool question actually can you
have more than two threads per core the
answer to that I think in theory is yes
if you go back and watch my
multi-threading videos hyper threading I
think we have a one you know one
specifically dedicated hyper threading
but it's it all in principle works the
same so you have two logical cores and
the basically it's it's a fancy molten
or multiplier it's a fancy scheduler
manipulation is ultimately what
simultaneous multi-threading is it
allows the scheduler to properly
allocate data down to hypothetical
pipelines which ultimately it's one big
pipeline and it basically sorts the data
to be processed more efficiently so that
there aren't gaps and stalls in the
processing time so if you think about
one process coming in and another
process coming this is slowed down to
like you know super like first popping
like point zero zero zero zero zero one
seconds here you know you have one data
pack to come in another bit come in and
then these two are kind of backed up
right the scheduler has two
send that data down pipelines but you
have so much data backed up that said
that scheduler basically has to
determine what goes next in the sequence
and if it if it has to take time to hunt
that's the latency involved there it has
to hunt for that data to send down the
pipeline then you'll have a stall you'll
have lag it might be for us you know a
tiny fraction of a second but it's still
there and it adds up especially if
you're doing something very intensive so
you could in theory have more than two
logical cores I believe I'm sure
someone's probably thought of it before
but I don't think that it I think the
law of diminishing returns probably
plays a huge part with that I can
imagine you know if you had four logical
cores per physical core you would have a
lot of those pipelines or you know
hypothetical pipelines just empty not
doing anything because splitting that
workload up into two separate logical
cores is good enough and if you get any
more than that then you would probably
have to you know scavenge resources from
somewhere else I don't know that's a
really interesting topic and off to
research it a bit more but I'm sure it's
something that I'm sure it's something
that's come up in the past that people
thought about so I don't know let me
interesting let's see here
I see Sennheiser is the best Sennheiser
is good Sennheiser is a good company I
like the sennheiser headset that I've
been using recently that we did the
sponsored spots for let's see
Carlos Taurus can I make a living making
YouTube videos currently depends on your
size and your video reach you guys hear
that my power supply just randomly ramps
up I'm not like a video on this cuz it's
just really annoying I'm gonna try to
get this on film it happens sporadically
but EVGA g2 g3 power supplies in
particular the fans on those things just
ramped up suddenly especially we have it
on eco mode and if you don't have those
fans on eco mode then they run pretty
loud to Bhima there's a lot of spans in
the system when eco modes not turned on
definitely especially idle and then when
you turn eco mode on it stays very quiet
which it's basically and it's a
advanced fan curve but when the power
supply gets hot for any reason even at
idle it's done this the fan will get
very loud and like it's doing right now
I know do that for 10 minutes and then
when the power supply cools back down
it'll drop to this super quiet level and
it'll keep doing that it'll jump up and
then jump down jump up jump down I don't
have this issue with P to power supplies
those are the ones I've mainly used from
EVGA it's just a shame that these have
been doing that I actually sent well I
didn't send these back yet I looked it
up and this is a recurring issue with
g3s but I sent these back to Jacob and I
said hey something's wrong with them you
know yeah they're just getting randomly
loud I've never had this issue with
power supplies before and he sent two
more and those two did it too so I
swapped those between systems I made
sure it wasn't the system I was you know
and I used the stock cables of swapping
everything out and sure enough it just
comes down to the fan curves and the
power supplies themselves causing these
issues so video to come on that soon but
yeah it's kind of a kind of a shame DC
what's the difference between BH + Z
motherboards good question starting with
B business-grade motherboards those
boards are going to have the least
amount of features they won't be
overclockable so you can overclock case
Q CPUs on Intel side H is gonna have a
little more of those features involved
maybe you get SLI crossfire maybe get
you know 7.1 surround sound maybe get
MDOT to support you know Wi-Fi whatever
and then but you're not gonna be able to
overclock those still locked chips
that's Z chipset so they're the ones
that will let you overclock so if you
have a k-series CPU from Intel it's an
unlocked multiplier SKU then you're
gonna want to pair that with a Z series
motherboard in the same family so that
you can manipulate that multiplier and
yeah that's Intel for AMD doesn't matter
for the new stuff but Intel does that
and make you pay more for the more
advanced chipset so I guess I should say
Dillon cost-cutting but tonight and I
see what's at my dude how did spider-man
feel when he turned to dust
rip rip anyone who's never seen that
movie before oh gosh that is a major rip
although I'm pretty sure most of you
seeing that before union three four
seven sixteen with two no like super
chat my dude I need one of those CPU
installation tools all dude I was
cracking up when I saw that he was being
so serious about it I thought it was
kind of like a joke at first I thought
the whole video frankly was a joke at
first and but that part in particular
that was a really set it off I'm like
there's no way he's recommending to use
this tool because most motherboards
don't even come with that tool and
honestly I don't know how to use it I've
never even used it because it you just
drop the chip in the socket you will on
triangle on the chip with the triangle
next to the socket you drop he kept
calling it like a slot but it's a socket
that's the proper term and you just drop
a thing and he was like pushing on it
and doing some weird stuff like don't do
that
I mean you watch any proper build guide
out there they'll show you how to do it
correctly
it just looked the whole video it forced
anyway okay make sure they miss some
more super chats okay I Israel Milanese
think for that $2 Canadian 25 2600
horizon 5 plus 1070 t I am getting
random freezing that's sounds like a
conflicting driver issue you shouldn't
be getting random freezing those too
I mean you shouldn't get any freezing
period it's likely a software conflict I
would reinstall your video drivers I
would also check you or you can check a
utilization in like something like MSI
Afterburner see what's what's being
choked oftentimes if you have random
skips and GP utilization that's a driver
conflict that's if it was a power issue
it would more than likely just shut off
I mean you would see something more
cataclysmic than that I'd need more
context to help you better but I would
start first with the drivers usually
it's a driver thing let's see
bazinga says Pepsi could have done a
better job Edmunds F Frick says thank
you for the verge reply video thank you
for your support Edvin and for watching
and I'm glad you guys enjoyed it and he
said had a little laugh I no idea I know
they didn't intend for us to laugh at it
but oh my gosh II couldn't help myself
okay scrolling down here let's see let's
see
Hunter Cox has flexed
he says flex your left arm with the
watch I have to see it okay so this is a
gear s3 and it's been dead for like four
weeks not because the battery doesn't
work anymore just because I haven't
cared to charge it in that nut mail and
so long this is the SmartWatch thing is
more of a fad to me I used to be more
interested in it I was when I made my
Apple watch videos and stuff and when I
first bought this watch I was into him
as well but then I just lost it I mean I
only really check it for the time at
which point like why did I spend $300 on
this what I could have gotten a $300
like a legit nice watch so I'm kind of
questioning the whole SmartWatch thing
at this point like a watch is meant to
be a watch and it might look cool they
have a screen and get to fiddle with it
but most of the time I'm literally just
doing this you know and it's really only
for the time I'm sure some people get a
good use out of it but I really don't
truck or bomb to Dallas is what HD what
headphones should I get with my new
audio setup are you looking for just
headphones or like a headset like with
the with a mic if you want just
headphones I got some really nice Bose
headsets that I that I use one it's a
noise cancelling Bose is a little
hardcore with a noise canceling
technology usually gives you that really
high pressure you know buildup in your
ears it makes you feel like you have a
clogged ear canal or whatever and you
get a headache from it
it's good on planes when it's really
loud it really helps with planes but
anywhere else it's kind of unusable
because it's just so like the noise
suppression tech is just so hardcore but
I Bose makes really good stuff
Sennheiser obviously makes really good
stuff geez I don't know that's really
where I would I would stick to a brand
like that banging olsen if you want to
go you know more euro route polk is good
klipsch is good gosh Yamaha you know you
know I mean they're all gonna sound good
that's why they sell but the audio files
know the difference I'm not necessarily
a headphone audio file as much as I am
like it
speaker audio file I can tell the
difference with speakers but it's for me
I'm not as picky when it comes to the
headsets and then bazinga again why is
Lisa's GP is sitting in the background a
good call actually I
if you check on Twitter bazinga I
swapped it because I'm running some
tests with a 90 DTI right now let's see
uh Devon Dijkstra is how you say name do
you know if n V link whoops if n V link
in the 20 series works like SLI or
developers have to put in a lot of work
to implement it or if it will just work
I have honestly haven't done enough
research and in V link to know how it is
if it's like SLI or you know it's like a
1 GPU handles one frame the other GP n
is another frame like I don't know the
the extent to which the connection you
know takes hold of both cards it may be
the case like SLI where one card is
utilized a hundred percent and the other
card is maybe 40 50 percent and then it
kind of diminishes from there with every
subsequent card you add all of the in V
link you're limited to two as far as I'm
aware so I'd have to do more research I
want to have a video come out very soon
straight up on in V link
obviously the they were bandwidth issues
before cards get more powerful and
that's why we went from one SLI finger
to to SLI fingers and now I guess that's
too much these these new cards next
generation is gonna is gonna push that
limit so and B link is the next big
thing and it might hang you know it
might include better utilization for
that second card but I would have to
test it first and I've never worked with
in being like in V link before so I will
have to see I'm sure in the coming weeks
we'll hear more about it I don't have
any RTX samples yet I'm sure I'll get
some soon but I didn't get the first
wave just because I've never worked with
Nvidia directly before so when I get my
hands on a couple of cards and I can
sync them up I will and I will
definitely report under because I am
curious to okay
scrolling down here to the good stuff ah
Noah says oh my god that verge video of
how to build a PC was hilarious and
cringy did oh my dude
yeah let's see here if you end up
reviewing the Arctic's 20 tea ice from
Andrew Andrew Andrew and Ray I don't
know how to say it I'm sorry I'm Andre
blend if you end up reviewing the r-tx
20 DTI could you do some blender
benchmarks comparing to the 10 series
cards sure I will actually I'll keep
that out all right that I'll put it on
my phone now usually when I'm like
benchmarking I'll keep some preliminary
stats on my phone just to make sure that
I had it synced up with what's reported
in fraps or whatever my data compiles to
in Excel I also want to show you guys
eventually how I compile all my on my
framerate data so how we measure
averages minimums maximums 1% point one
percents what those mean and talk about
how I create graphs that you guys see in
videos because I use excel for almost
all that some people use some
third-party software but I do it all in
Excel that's when I'm most comfortable
with so if you want to make graphs for
your own channel maybe or use this stuff
for for some schoolwork and I'll show
you guys how to create those kind of off
topic video but I think it's applicable
to a lot of people it's good to know how
to use Excel it really is the only excel
in almost any business finance
engineering job you have so a good
question
and I will definitely be sure to include
blender benchmarks when I get to
benchmark it ok here let's see Dylan
cost cost oh thanks for the super chat
my dude our processors power directly
related to heat output mm-hmm there is
its there's their formulas that
calculate TDP directly from frequency
and power draw but they're not they're
not the same thing so when you see a CPU
with a 91 watt TDP that doesn't mean
that the CPU is gonna pull 91 watts of
power it just means you have to have a
cooler sandwiched on top of that CPU on
top of that IHS capable of dissipating
91 watts of heat or handling that amount
of heat output and obviously you can't
have less energy go into a system then
comes out makes no
you can't create energy that's one of
the that's like a principle it's a law
but you know what I mean
so because you can't create energy it
means that you have to have the same
amount of energy at least going into a
system that comes out on at least it has
to be but it'll take different forms so
electrical energy work goes into it and
then you get electrical work out of it
and you also get heat energy out of it
heat is a waste product and that heat is
the TDP value so if you assume that the
system is doing some work then your TDP
is inherently not going to be equal to
power draw
there will be an efficiency there and
although they're not directly related we
have a video talking about this more
specifically you guys always make me
talk about complex stuff I want live so
I'm really struggling it's like pictured
and explain it without referring to my
own video but your TDP in a nutshell is
going to be slightly lower in most cases
than overall power draw and obviously if
you overclock your cpu your TDP will
increase because you'll be pulling that
much more power through the through the
system through the CPU when you
overclock in so there you go need e78
6.99 soup which i think about dude will
gtx card prices be lower due to RTX
cards they already are my friend check
ebay i've been talking about this all
the time lately on twitter check eBay
they've gone down quite a bit already
israel mallanna's fabulous super chat
thank you again might do reinstall
windows and everything already and still
getting random freezing it might are
using like a riser cable or something if
using like a riser cable cut that out
plug the card directly into that 16-lane
slot and your board the very top one and
then if it's already there move it to a
different slot try that it could also
just be an issue with the card maybe
there's an imperfection on the board
it's just that's a very weird thing to
see recurring skips like that maybe try
older versions of the driver as well
might be that particular driver for AMD
that's that's messing up let's see here
okay I got a scroll down you guys I'm
getting backed up here okay this is a
cool question AJ f16 what is your
favorite a io cooler I don't want to
answer that
just yet because I'm I had I sent an
email to Corsair I asked for an h1 50 i
and an h1 10 I mm-hmm because I want to
use those in the future when we do CPU
you know comparisons stability tests and
stuff I want to have two pretty sweet a
iOS on hand in our inventory all the
time to use the h1 10 is likely the one
that we'll use for most tests because
that's like a pretty mainstream powerful
AI oh and then the H 150 I am or let's
want to just review see how much better
it is in the competition so I don't want
to say just yet what my favorite is
because I haven't used to course they're
a oh and quite a while and I know how
good the H 100 h 110 I series are so
we'll see let's see
Nuria says finally someone who knows
headphones and High School people were
like beats by dre look beats are beats
are good but they're not two $300 kids
they're really and then they over kill
the baton the bass on beats are so
hardcore like I you feel like you're in
a tunnel with some serious reverb and
like it's all on the lows I don't know I
just it's not a very clean sound I mean
I prefer a very balanced tone slightly
lower mids and and and that's that's
good enough for me let's see problematic
wagon $10 Canadian super check my dude I
appreciate that love your channel by the
way how do you feel about how
tight-lipped nvidia has been about the
r-tx
20 series launch and what do you think
it means well I talked about this quite
a bit in my original something's fishy
about the RT X launch video if you
haven't already watched that I invite
you to watch that but to answer more
specifically if you just don't have the
time whatever I think that they were
being silent about it because they are
shifting the way we approach graphics
card performance evaluations because RT
X is centered on this rage racing
approach which is much more difficult to
do than current rasterization techniques
and think about the billions of light
particles that we're having to trace
through a scene and then finding the
ones that hit a certain point on an
object that's pre-rendered right
you have all these different triangles
basically and these triangles have think
of them like coordinates they have
certain location and all these particles
zooming through space in this scene you
know of those particles some of them are
gonna hit this particular point and the
computer has to evaluate how many of
those light particles hit that
particular point and then you have to
multiply that by the number of triangles
you have comprising the object which in
today's day and age is very high if you
go back to like 1995 most of those games
you know 2000 let's let's if you look at
the original tomb raider the original
tomb raider like the playstation or
whatever that was a that was one I
played was a very you know rudimentary
from today's standpoint because it had
just a certain number of faces that you
could see a certain number of edges and
those were all triangles they were
polygons and now with because we have
graphics you know potential is so much
higher we can render so much faster and
keep up with the modern demand that we
have in games those triangles can be
multiplied so many times so it increases
the smoothness of an object let's say of
a round object right like a sphere and
you try to display that with a hundred
different triangles
well that sphere is gonna look pretty
edgy right because those triangles are
so big but if you add millions of
triangles to that sphere it's gonna look
very smooth when you zoom out you know
of course you zoom far enough in you'll
see each individual polygon but if you
zoom out the big picture it's much more
smooth but each of those polygons
requires a certain degree of horsepower
to render and then you have to
incorporate the light techniques which
we've been using rasterization for a
while but with ray tracing you have to
account for each one of those faces each
one of those triangles those polygons
that are going to be hit by a certain
number of particles and they're billions
of those and usually millions if not
billions of polygons in one scene all of
that has to be rendered in a split
second and then it has to be rendered
again and again and again and again and
you guys see how many times you know you
think about 60 frames per second right
60 frames per second that is a lot of
that's a huge workload
really I mean think about just the
number of times a DP has to process and
render an image that's changing over
time that's subject to where you move
right it's not it can't pre plan these
things it's based on your input so just
a you know kind of a macro view of how
hard these graphics cards are working
and ray tracing is a totally different
approach to this and it's much more
difficult to do technically and that's
why the architecture looks so weird we
have tensor cores now which we have a
dedicated video on we have RT cores
which I don't know anything about
because they haven't said much about
what RT cores actually are but they have
all this extra stuff packed in there
using RT one of the RT x ops now which
is a totally different way to benchmark
cards it's a little crazy so if there's
a lot of stuff to to think about when
you're thinking about how difficult it
is to do modern rasterization techniques
but then RT X on top of that ray tracing
is is that much more intense so yeah
look I think they were a little shady
about it because they're not shady they
did they were vague purposefully because
I don't think these cards I mean we've
already seen how these cards performed
with Rachel on with RT X whatever on you
know whether it be super sampling
whatever it takes a hit it takes a toll
on any card it doesn't take as much of a
toll though on the RT X car it's
specifically designed to handle these
scenes and that's something that people
are gonna have to trade off they're not
gonna have this huge bump in performance
maybe I don't expect 50% plus if that is
the case and great but I don't expect it
instead what we'll see is a different
approach it's like the first it's the
little kicker it's it's the beginning
push and it's always rough for the
company that jumps in first but I think
in the future it will pay off we'll see
I think they were vague because people
don't know how to understand it yet they
don't know how to see it I just think
that they should have been more
forthcoming and they should have
approached it slightly different than
they did at first you know instead of
just forcing this stuff onto us they
should have gradually eased it in
instead of forcing developers anyone
else to catch on right away let's see
here Snickers satisfies me a lot
Snickers or yummy thank you for that
super chat by 1080 open box for 350 or
2070 four five nine nine dude 1080
opened by you can get a 1080 right now
for like 300 bucks on eBay if you
actually look so I would you you can
keep scavenging scavenging eBay you can
find them for cheaper than 350 honestly
and if you if you find one find a 1080
that's you know maybe you got two eight
pins right so it's gonna it's a third
party adding board custom adding board I
should say that has a better power
delivery standards then that would be
the sweet spot for anything between 3
and 350 if you really want a 20 70
weight but if you don't care that much
and you know a 1080 look we know what
1080 is gonna bring to the table then
getting them used I don't think there's
anything wrong with that right now okay
let's see scrolling down but-but-but-but
papa Maximus VX do we have to super chat
to have our question answered no I've
actually answered about half of these
questions in this live stream so far
that aren't super chatted including
yours
so congratulations Maximus VX you wasted
your question by asking if I was even
gonna answer your question in the first
place so Gigi my dude
let's see Napster lover 2375 love your
reaction video for The Verge PC bill
clip I appreciate the Napster thank you
for tuning in to the live stream right
now my dude Zion train ISM what product
were you most surprised of the review
results oh that's a tough question I'm
gonna have to go back who most surprised
that's a really tough question I think I
was most surprised I think I was most
surprised when I benchmarked my first 10
atti that was a big I mean I had come
from 1980 TI's and Jesus 10 70s we're
doing what 90 DT eyes could do so I knew
that 1080 T either means that much
faster
and I think benchmarking the first 10
ATT I ever got my hands on was it was
really surprising to me because I I knew
how good we are
had it and then seeing how much better
how much more we were missing by not
having something as capable as a 1080 I
just kind of blew my mind you know I'm
more accustomed to it whatever 1080i
it's kind of the benchmark now for a
high-end gaming rig but at the you know
and then very in the very beginning it's
hard to think about what you were
thinking about when it was released but
it was a really impressive card when it
first came out
so yeah let's see here Greggy berry asks
did you go to Bay High or mostly I went
to Mosley High School that means you
probably live locally
Kevin marry Yong Yong gam at science
studio what engineering are you in how
have you found the job market I have a
degree in petroleum engineering and I
will have my Masters in Business
Administration next month so I'll be
finished with with both degrees well I'm
already finished with wine I'll finish
the second one soon
and I haven't really I've put out
applications just to kind of see the job
mark it's still really tough it was
especially tough when I was in school
because gas prices had dropped so much
there was there was so much oil and
reserve that they weren't hiring
engineers to drill for more of it so I
was a little discouraged then you know a
lot luckily YouTube came at right point
I didn't expect it to become a full-time
thing but I'm really glad I did what I
did when I did it because I'm able to do
this full-time and honestly I would
prefer to do this full-time even though
it doesn't pay as much as it was you
know a career in the petroleum industry
would I still enjoy getting to do my own
thing you know do things that you guys
want to want to see some it get to
experiment build talk with companies
travel for events that's one of the best
jobs in the world so yep let's see I
think I missed a couple I get through
super chats mmm let's see here because
you guys are actually I don't want you
guys I feel like you paid me for nothing
I appreciate the donations ok let's see
here we have FX screamer $5 super chat
my dude I appreciate that is it worth
upgrading my 32 gig 2400 I go it's
around two thirty two hundred megahertz
with RGB 5820k overclocked 4.2 gigahertz
lots of Photoshop use 64gb better than
higher o'clock look 32 gigabytes is
honestly gonna be I mean less doing some
serious overhaul at Photoshop
even 32 gigs is enough for most of what
I do I can't imagine how much more
complex to get although I'm sure you
could find excuses for that 32 gigs is
fine I would say unless you're Syrian
less you're literally seeing your RAM
cap out then you're gonna need more
obviously but for a 5820k Intelli is
less frequency dependent in the case of
AMD right memory frequency and timings
are tied to the Infinity fabric so if
you increase your memory frequencies
then you're going to increase the
transfer rates between CC X's which are
clusters of course in rise and dies so
it's more dependent Verizon CPUs and
that's why Rison one in my opinion
suffered more than it had to because it
was just so stubborn when it came to
memory timings and frequency Rison two
totally fixed that second generation
stuff is great I can run XMP and have no
qualms at all when it comes to memory
overclocking so I think you're fine with
a 5820k at just 24 megahertz it's not
something that I would see is a pivotal
you know concerning thing right now
let's see bazinga again my dude what
case is that in the background blue
light case labs which case that right
there this that is my router actually
hate for you to waste five bucks asking
that question but that is my router it's
just a surfboard I have a Google home
let's see if I can turn it so I have a
Google home and sorry I ripped my
microphone are you guys listening to it
this is my Google home router I I picked
it because this is easy you know I'm not
like a super hardcore networking savvy
guy so about Google home because was
super simple to use setup and then I
have the modem that's it's a modem I
don't know if I call that a router
before but then I had my modem there the
surfboard that Jacksonville wall so yep
okay I sorry I'm trying to get through
the Super chats because I feel bad I
don't want these guys to go without
their questions answered because they're
throwing money at me
you guys Dillon cost Oh $2.99 super chat
your mind is an ocean
I want to swim through I thank you thank
you for that i king RGB RPG sorry i king
RPG $5 super chat monday judging for my
recent roblox views videos in my channel
do you think my GPU is dying i have an
EVGA gtx 1063 gig and fans are now
louder
it lags while recording I'm I can't
imagine 1060 getting too hot but what
you could do is replace the stock
thermal pace so if you take off the
cooler and just get down to the bare PCB
you can clean off that thermal compound
usually it's pretty trashy you replace
it with something a bit more hardcore
and that should lower temps possibly
keep the system overall quieter
especially under load may also though
you might be hitting the three gig
buffer limit so having a 1063 gig is I
think that's something I would advise
against strongly because 10 60s are
equitable to 9 9 80s basically from
Maxwell and if you guys remember 9 70s
1980s 1980 had 4 gigs the 970 had 3
point 5 gigs plus 500 Meg's with like 2
super slow memory but that was I mean
that was close there were some games
that would max that out or get pretty
darn close to maxing out even GTA 5 got
close to maxing out 4 gigs of RAM so I
recommend 1066 gigs only in the future
if you guys are gonna buy used
especially look for the six big ones
because you might be hitting a via Ram
buffer I don't know it depends but
you're pretty close
let's see twisted ninja think of the
final Canadians to perch at my dude I am
late to the party House of stream bin so
far mah dude it's been pretty chill
everyone's been super cool I'm trying to
get through the super chat to feel back
as people are asking questions in the
chat but I'm trying I'm trying folks I'm
trying trying really hard here I see
ffff oh yeah you guys were ripping him
on let's see scrolling up Oscar Salazar
good last name my dude would you
consider an r5 2600 and GT X 1080 a
bottleneck no I wouldn't say that's a
bottleneck at all you very few games
would ever run into a CPU bottleneck
actually in most cases if you ramped up
all your graphics settings with your
1080 your 1080 is gonna be the
bottleneck before r5 2600 is believe it
or not
so yeah something to take home there
thing for that super chat mod dude
it's going up alan huntington find all
the super chat rise in five 2600 x 470
16 gigs around 1070 how long till they I
need to upgrade to keep 1440p 60 love
the videos by the way good luck with the
Masters I appreciate that Alan I look
that system is gonna have you set for a
long time I would say 1440 p6 he's gonna
be easy for the next two three four
years and even then that CPU is gonna
set you set you up for probably longer
than that most games are still gonna be
dependent on primarily four to six cores
you have multi-threading onboard as well
so that's really great 16 gigs of ram is
perfect for x4 70 board for overclocking
it's perfect the 10-7 team up the only
thing you want to upgrade in the future
I would say for now stick with it two
three years you'll be fine in that
resolution and maybe even a higher
framerate at 60fps if you're feeling a
bit more adventurous victor's 22 what's
going on victress think of it at 7:29
new zealand subha chad did you notice in
the verge vid he damaged the cpu with
the placement tool he pressed a credit
card onto the LGA side of the cpu I did
not notice that I noticed that he didn't
even like I don't know I pointed this
out in my video but like he he had the
the installation tool why he was using
that I have no freaking clue but like he
had it on the side of the desk but he
didn't even use it install it I don't
know what he was doing but I didn't
notice I didn't notice that so if he did
that that that would have been even
funnier but I I just think that hold
especially that part like it just looked
I know he said he's built pcs in the
past on Twitter but it just looked it
looked like a new mistake honestly like
the first time I built the PC I'm pretty
sure I was a little timid with the CP
piece I didn't know how hard to press I
know if I just set it in there and then
use a retention no I'm just kidding the
socket lever and sure enough that was
all it took
but it just I feel like I realized I'm
peaking a little bit I'm gonna turn my
volume down just a tad for those who
have headphones I don't want to peak and
blow your eardrums I did notice that he
was just fiddling with it a little
strangely so yeah Thank You Steven for
that super check my did I see Steven
zero zero thank you all for watching now
back to the questions not that those
super Jets more questions but other
questions for the folks that don't feel
like donating and that's totally fine I
don't expect you guys to donate when we
live stream I just I feel like I have to
get those I
make sure I address those questions
because they're going out of their way
to support us financially and you guys
know okay I am Groot at science to do
what brands would you recommend for
cherry MX red full-size red switches I
mean they're all gonna be pretty much
the same I Cherry MX has pretty good QC
standards although I will say that I
have noticed a few differences and feel
between like blues and browns like not
all blue MX switches to me feel the same
so I have a G scale blue keyboard I have
a Corsair blue keyboard they don't feel
the same like I know they're the same
switch but they just don't feel the same
to me and I might have to do with a key
cap design something along those lines
but I'm comfortable with Corsair
definitely comfortable with them
uncomfortable with HyperX I'm
comfortable with g.skill and I mean I
use Coolermaster keyboards in this room
and Coolermaster keyboards are great as
well if you get cherry MX keys so yeah I
would recommend any of those brands
those are the ones that I have
experience with Elise let's see Brian's
taker civil engineering or trade school
good question depends on what you want
to do you know if you want to be a
welder or something I think trade school
is a better route like anything that's
that's Union organized usually there's
gonna be trade school paths that you
want to follow like shipbuilding and
stuff like that you know like those are
all trade jobs and they'll still pay
look respect for people that go to trade
school it's to me it's just as
viable if not more viable under certain
circumstances than colleges you know you
don't need a bachelor's degree to make a
lot of money and in fact the benefits
included in most Union jobs are better
than just private sector benefits that
companies bestow upon their employees
because they feel like being generous so
it depends on what your career path is
but if you want to do something that you
know is a big Union supporting your
endeavor then I would just go trade
school that would be my like if I wanted
to do underwater welding let's say which
is a that's a very specific trade that's
trade school to me
like that's a done deal yeah you could
get a civil engineering or mechanical
engineering degree but ultimately you're
gonna have to go back anyway and take a
lot of classes or go through a certain
trade school anyway to figure out how to
do
that stuff underwater right so very
specific cases but just an example of a
scenario in which traits what would be
preferable let's see
scrolling down Gio Sam asked so what do
you think of this pairing I 565 hundred
with the GTX 1050 TI it's not a bad
pairing ultimately I'm in the 6500 it's
a few generations old but still viable
for many games you could probably bump
that up to a 1070 1080 and still be fine
some of the newer games are gonna
struggle a little bit you might max out
some cores battlefield one is one of the
ones I always use for example that's a
game that utilizes many cores basically
as you throw at it but I would say yeah
gtx 1050 TI's fine maybe a little under
kill for the cpu you could go up to a
1070 1080p okay so in the use market you
wanna play with use market at this point
you'd be perfectly down to do that I
think it is fun let's see scrolling down
okay gherkin says do you talk slower I'm
talking fast because I wanna get through
as many questions as I can so if you
can't understand what I'm saying just go
back and watch this live stream when
it's archived like in an hour and just
play it back at a slower speed I'm sorry
I'm just trying to get to as many people
as I can want them to feel like I'm
getting to that questions let's see
John's what does a good editing PC need
I would say in today's day and age at
least six cores I would say 16 gigs of
ram and depending on the software you
use if you need Adobe products an Nvidia
card because you can CUDA accelerate
with an Nvidia card and that will pay
off in after-effects and other things
like that so there you go okay scrolling
down
mr. KF gaming bit of a personal question
you'll have to answer but what category
would you say your credit score Falls in
I have a good credit I mean I've never
missed a payment or anything like that
like I I try to stay on top of my
finances so my credits good it's not
like I'm not you know 850 maxed out
credit score but it's a good credit you
know I was i financed my car with with
credit now this whole piece of cake the
only thing that's always sketchy to to
banks and stuff is when I say well I'm
self-employed and no like oh you're so
blew it and then I say I'm a youtuber
and then there are even more like oh
that seems super risky but look like I I
I'm I try to stay on top of my finances
and I try to save as much money as I can
per month so like when I bought my car I
wanted to make sure that the money I was
gonna finance the amount of money that I
financed my car which is about half the
car's value I wanted to make sure that I
had that money in the bank already to
pay off at any time I wanted so if
anything happened let's say to the
channel the channel got deleted tomorrow
and I suddenly had no job and no way to
earn money I could at least pay off my
debts right away that's just a practice
that I've tried to uphold since the very
beginning I do that with my credit cards
everything else
I never pull out more money loan however
you want to call it I never pull more
credit than I can pay off immediately
and that's something that's just kept me
in the clear so you know that everyone's
gonna look at that differently approach
the subject differently but I always
play it safe when it comes to money
because look there's a reason a lot of
people go under declare bankruptcy live
paycheck to paycheck that's its I mean
it's not easy you know it's easier for
some people some people are predisposed
if you will to do better in society you
can make those arguments any way you
look at it but in general those who are
good with money who are smart with money
no matter how much money they make from
their job are going to be stable-ish
you know if you make 30 grand a year
live within your means if you make 60
grand a year live within your means
don't splurge don't spend more money
than you're making that's just dumb you
get a debt and you'll never pay it off
so there you go
let's see Meister's 40 ask are you at
WWE fan absolutely not not that I have
anything against people that like I have
family members who watch WWE stuff it's
just too fake to me like I it I just
it looks cheesy i if I ever watch it for
a split second it's just to get a good
laugh of it because it just looks so
fake I'm sorry I really hope you guys
don't you know blacklist me for that but
that's just my it's just my thing it's
my preference
I tucked Sedo cat at science studio do
you think the verge will ever respond to
your video loved it by the way I don't
think so the verge is vs. what millions
of so just saying I'm a peon by
comparison I just I feel like it's
important for our audience to know that
so when people will type in how to build
a computer channels like mine come up
channels like Kyle Paul J Linus those
all those channels come up under that
category and I don't want the Verge's
video to sneak its way into that block
of videos and you know just mislead
people
so all right like I said earlier in the
livestream I don't expect them to take
it down because Capital One paid for
that video you can't just delete videos
that companies pay you to create so
they're kind of in a rut but I will say
that it was just poorly executed and it
definitely definitely you know it just
evoked a response from from my channel
from Kyle's channel it's just kind of a
laughing joke at this point okay but
let's see here
Adam someone said it isn't fake
referring to WWE let's see he okay
scrolling up Adam Stevens this is Greg
do you like UFC now we're talking UFC I
can get into it depends really on the on
the that the people involved like I know
a few fighters that I always try to
watch whenever they come on but it's
that's I gotta just I gotta be in that
mood you know I gotta be in the mood
till I see people just throw punches in
honestly like most of the time I'm not
even anywhere close to those channels
when I'm surfing through stuff so it's
just not something that I watch
regularly but I would much prefer to
watch that over WWE if I'd answers your
question okay you guys are getting some
inside stuff here getting all that all
the personal life you're gonna profile
on me let's see
good questions okay what does a good
programming PC need look so programming
compiling that's gonna use as far as I'm
aware I don't do a lot of it will does
and from what we'll tells me as many
cores as you can throw at at a
programming PC the the better you know
the more cores you have at your disposal
the better because you'll be able to run
execute programs much quicker you know
there's not really an optimization issue
there because you're gonna utilize as
much horsepower as you have at your
disposal to run and compile those
programs so yeah that's a topic I don't
wanna get too far into because I don't
personally program very much at all I'm
just now like I'm kind of going through
the html5 CSS phase trying to understand
how those things work I've never
actually coded personally html5 so I'm
having to kind of teach myself that
watch youtube videos and then I'm gonna
get into some like JavaScript
maybe C++ C sharp stuff later on but
that's something that I kind of want to
do on my own in the future once I finish
up school so we'll see but I know that
programming PC's you're gonna benefit
from having more cores most people don't
actively program though which is why
higher core count chips like 16 32 core
chips don't really apply to most people
okay
i King RPG good question do you think IO
shields are too poorly designed look I
think they're obsolete I think that the
motherboards with built-in i/o shield
some ones that you don't have to pre
install they're already built into the
the rear i/o ports if you will on the
board those are much better my a Zeus
boards like that so there's no
detachable rear i/o shield you just push
the motherboard into position and then
that plate lines up perfectly with that
cutout at the back of the back of the
case so yeah that's I think they're
obsolete yeah for sure I they're just a
pain to deal with straight up okay here
let's see uh Oh Steven double double
zero I see it another super chat from
you mine do you think that five dollars
planning to put six RGB fans in my next
build what would you recommend to make
sure I have all the available
connections
okay so six RGB fans it depends on the
company some will have proprietary Doc's
proprietary connectors and then those
will all run they'll run into that box
and then that box will have like a USB
2.0 cable and at 2.0 cable plugs into
the usually the bottom of your
motherboard in a 2.0 header and then you
can control that that control box with
software it's basically like a little
hub but it depends on the company so
some companies will have like switches
literally manual switches on the frame
of the fan other companies like
Thermaltake will integrate the actual
fan connector with the RGB connectors so
you have just one cable going from each
fan into a big hub and then from that
hub a USB connector down to the board so
you're gonna have all the connections
more than likely if you buy it from a
reputable brand in the box of the kid
that you buy but if you're just buying
RGB fans in general that like do a
specific thing like they're just RGB and
they keep rotating colors then you're
not gonna have any control you're not
gonna have any dedicated control they're
usually they're not addressable and
you're just going to deal with whatever
they show and you'll have just a single
three or four pin connection for voltage
your PWM control Oh anyway alright
I definitely feel after an hour of
talking straight the strain on voice
Maximus 5 oh you're the one who comment
- really
Maximus V X he said his question is too
long for super chat so he's gonna post
below interesting tactic let's see and
we scroll up here I'm looking Maximus
I'm looking to GT X 1080 founders in SLI
they run hot I want to crack in G 12 to
put 2h 55s on the GPUs ok rads 1 I'll be
each one pound each ok think using 3m
tape to stick them to my case would work
you want to stick radiators to your case
using you want to stick to age 55
radiators so you can't mmm the 3m tape
I've never done that before I'd be kind
of sketchy because at any point if you
get any moisture build-up at all like if
it's humid outside and it gets humid in
your house and then
that that tape is not as sticky anymore
I've dealt with 3m when it comes to
putting up these things on the walls
it's not the best stuff it's really not
because these foam panels sometimes fall
it's just not a good place to adhere
those so at one pound each that's pretty
heavy you have to really plaster down
that 3m tape if you wanted to get those
to stick I would try your best to find
proper mounting positions for those
otherwise I mean yeah I think if you
just stick with to 120 fan or to 120
rads you would probably fit those up
front or up top if you just orient them
backwards from each other but then that
would look kind of weird I mean I see
your problem I don't know that's tough
dude that's really tough to cool two of
them if you're gonna - if you're gonna
cool two cards like that G you probably
need a better case if you're just
wanting to 3m tape them I would swap to
a bigger case honestly at that point
that's just my take on it okay let's see
what you pick Hannah asks what's your
favorite MCU movie I think it's well I
shouldn't say it's obvious because I
don't have that avatar anymore it's my
profile picture but definitely the Iron
Man series so M see if there's a Marvel
comic universe I have always been the
biggest fan of Iron Man and apparently
Iron Man plays a huge role in the next
Avengers movie and I haven't read the
comics that for long to know exactly why
but I know that he teams up with nebula
and a few others and then you have um
what's the chicks name I forget her name
the one that they showed at the end of
the movie I can't remember her name the
Captain Marvel yeah I think that's it
and it Captain Marvel shows up so it'd
be a really cool movie but yeah Iron
Man's always been my fav
because it was a first Marvel movie to
come out like officially in that series
but because I just loved tech and Tony
to me is just a really funny character
to watch sometimes okay um let's see neo
blue another interesting question from
neo blue have we reached
peak design for fans and heatsinks
interesting question I think so I mean
look it's gonna come down to the metals
it's gonna come down to the the biggest
efficiencies when it comes to to heat
design and fan design are the connection
points between the IHS and the cooler
between the die and the IHS that's why
we use liquid metal to alleviate those
concerns but those are still some of the
biggest points of efficiency loss and
then of course if you want a nicer
cooler a better cooler you just get
something that's bigger that it can
handle higher thermal output so I think
we've reached I mean we've reached a
limit I think it would have to we'd have
to change how we approached it in the
future but for now I think we've reached
a limit at least when it comes to like
heatsink design like I can't picture it
getting much better than it already is
you have to maximize airflow at the same
time maximize surface area and you know
heat pipe integration you guys know that
heat pipes have like a fluid inside
right that condenses and expands when
the heat from the CP below is throw it
into the cooler anyway yeah I guess more
technical but in general I would say we
probably hit some sort of limit when it
comes to heat sink design at least let's
see dick OS hey Greg I just applied
liquid metal to my Asus gaming laptop
since the fans run less I now notice a
lot of coil wine when using Chrome that
is a rip my friend I know exactly what
you're talking about my daleks PS 13 had
serious coolant issues in that funny
about like you solved one problem only
to expose another problem that that
blows we know what you're feeling right
now so anything can do there are a few
remedies that work under certain
circumstances I know for the XPS 13 s a
lot of people were saying that that coil
line came from the SSD so maybe swapping
your SSD or m2 drive well at different
forms of an SSD but either you're in I'm
about to drive or you're full on two and
a half inch SSD swap that out or you
could use some sort of like non
conductive epoxy and try to think of
something you could put on the board to
prevent because coil one is just the
inductors vibrating when you have
electricity passing through the
inductors basically ways to mitigate
magnetic resonance I'm not using the
right word but the inductors basically
vibrate and that's why you get that coil
whine it's usually a high-pitched sound
because they're vibrating so fast right
the higher the frequency the higher the
sound the sound pitch so you could try
using something like that to keep it
more stationary but you have to pinpoint
exactly where the coil one's coming from
up front I was it was not something that
i Doan to hardcore with the XPS 13 I
ended up ended up selling it l if I sold
it or if I gave it away
I don't remem
three years ago but yeah so maybe maybe
check that out there's some forums where
people try to fix it and they use stuff
like that or they just swap the drives
altogether if the source is the drives
so I'm just play around or not okay
Karam or is science studio watching this
chat stream or not yes Carl that was
your opportunity to ask a question but
instead you said to ask what I was
looking at chat or not so our IP my dude
vadoma Cavis FX key awesome that's a
cool name Greg can you answer me super
chat that I've asked like 30 minutes ago
please let me scroll down let's see yeah
um that's ski I'm looking for it I'm
looking for Needy in vitam Quebec ski ok
I see it right here I got your buddy hi
what do you think about buying a used GT
X 1080 founders edition in my art my rx
40 died last week and now I'm looking
for replacement it was never used for
mining yeah so it depends on how much
money you're paying for the founders
edition card and it also depends on
where you live in the States
GT X 1080 they're going for anything for
like 250 to 350 bucks so if you can find
one for around $300 that's a sweet
that's a sweet buy I was buying 90 to
TI's last week for like 220 a pop those
are comparable to 10 70s even 10
seventies are going for like 220 240 a
pop on eBay so if you look hard enough
you'll find some good deals I don't
think that's a bad choice at all just
get you something now because you're
arcs for your rx 40 died
and you won't regret the purchase even
with the new stuff coming out a 1080 is
gonna be a huge jump up from arcs from
from a 480 and you're I mean you're
gonna save a lot of money honestly
because the r-tx cards are fairly
expensive
I think that's an understatement so
sorry about that valium
let's see scrolling down let's do a
couple more questions I am
my throat is shot let's see here okay
I see angel flute oh here we go New
Zealand $5 soup which I think my dude
angel maybe maybe it's a guy maybe it's
a girl I don't know anyway upgrading
from 1080p 16 one millisecond to 14 41
40 Hertz 144 Hertz IPS 5 millisecond
when I noticed the response time and put
like difference so you will notice okay
so the input the input lag and response
time aren't directly tied together there
they're different things so it would
depend on the monitor but most monitors
aren't gonna have you know input lag on
monitors is usually going to be good
especially for 144 Hertz panel it's
gonna be almost instant you probably
won't notice a difference there now with
respect to response time you will
probably notice the difference between
one millisecond v especially with his
high paced games I don't think those
gonna be a big enough issue to where you
regret your upgrade because you're gonna
be so intrigued by how much better 144
Hertz looks so it's something you'll
notice you'll see the ghosting just
slightly but again certain circumstances
it's gonna look very clear for the most
part and I I mean I have the PG 27 8 Q
or 8 8 R I have the teeny inversion of
what you're talking about mines the 165
Hertz TN ASIS panel and I think mine I
don't know if mine has a 5 millisecond
or 1 millisecond but I don't really
notice it I play pub G a lot I play city
skylines a Liam place unlike csgo other
first-person shooters and I don't notice
it very much so if you if you are super
particular about it maybe you're like a
pro player or something
it'll probably bother you a little bit
but you're gonna love that 144 it's
action let me
you okay let's see Apple device Pro what
do you think about the new iPhone a 10s
max 512 costing as much as a good custom
build I'm gonna save my answer to that
question for video that's gonna come up
this week so stay tuned you guys want to
know exactly what I feel how I feel
about Apple and their latest releases
I'm gonna give you a rundown at least
with respect to iPhones this week any
video so stay tuned for that it's not
like a total rip video but I mean it you
know I've just I give you my opinions on
on the upgrade paths when I would
upgrade one I wouldn't certain scenarios
to play around with and I also talked
about the prices and the value in each
of those so we'll see it's you know if
you hate Apple you're not gonna be
disappointed with a video you know like
I'm not taking the side of Apple I I've
used an Apple product in the past I went
on bought more like two grand stuff that
video is still doing really well believe
it or not on the channel and I get I
gave you guys my raw impressions of the
ecosystem and everything else but I
never once backed off of my
predisposition that Apple products are
expensive they're premium are they worth
the premium price tag in my opinion at
this point I've got to say not really I
don't want to say flat-out no there's
still an advantage in certain
circumstances using Apple products
obviously if you own a MacBook and you
own an iPhone and you own and a series
one or two or three or four Apple watch
then you're gonna love that ecosystem
the communication between all those
devices
it's very coherent but if you step
outside the ecosystem for anything if I
went and got a you know some Android
phone and I still had an Apple watch in
an Apple MacBook they're not gonna
communicate well at all so you have to
stay within the ecosystem to truly
benefit from it at which point you're
spending thousands of dollars so you
know Apple suckering yen definitely is
it worth it in most cases no I really
don't think it is and I'll talk more
about that in the video but upfront yeah
I don't think the upgrade from an iPhone
10 to a 10s or a 10s max makes any sense
and even if you're on an iPhone 8 I
still don't think the a the upper
it makes any sense unless you can get
all your money back for your iPhone 8 or
8 plus which I doubt you'll be able to
do okay oh let's see here Jason as in
fade oh I think for that super Chapman
dude one Dalek Canadian I appreciate
your support and thank you for watching
let's see here
Stephan arses after this is over check
out Bubba hotep it will change your life
Greg I will do that
timidly I feel like you're trying to
trick me in watching something that's
really weird let's see let's see one
more good question one more good
question so give me something that's
like super deep like I want to dwell on
this question for a week straight and
then come back next week and answer it
because I've been thinking about it all
week so I'll wait a few seconds for you
guys to finally catch up in the live
stream so I can see those questions in
the chat and then we will end with one
deep thought-provoking question and make
it question your whole life I want
something like that in the chat so I'm
waiting folks let me see what you guys
got going on mr. G mr. Giggs I see that
slimline keyboard question she's very
quickly on that one I haven't used a
slimline keyboard and quite a while and
I actually ever like I've seen them
quite a bit but I haven't actually
purchased one or asked for one to review
because they look weird but I will
eventually try one out and I'll let you
know let's see ooh get 360 rec - can you
make $100 PC lol that's certainly
possible I'll see what I can do let's
see huh Bruna Melo any reason to get
beat through 50 over a 320 for not
overclocking yes under certain
circumstances you will have certain
features with be 50 boards that you
won't have with a 320 a320s usually
pretty bare from a motherboard
perspective so I would stick with B I
would stick with B Series at least if
you're not on a super tight budget
because you might have that Warner you
know there's one or two features that
you would have otherwise missed if you
had foregone B B or X chipsets
okay I see these are really TJ taste is
your thoughts on deep government
operations a battle get me thinking for
a while let's see okay if this is good
neo blue yeah you gotta get questions
today if people in anime watch anime is
it live-action here's an even better
question if people in anime watch anime
does it look to them like it's real life
or does it look like anime to people who
are in animes like our people in n mas
aware that their animes and if they're
watching animes on TV do they look like
regular people to you and I if we were
watching regular people on our TVs woah
that's a good one woah okay yeah
alright folks good questions I
appreciate all of you watching we're
gonna end this we're gonna end the live
chat the live stream with a very very
fun thing at least for me cuz I try to
read all your comments as quickly as
possible I want you guys to before you
leave comment down in the chat with your
favorite emoji I don't care if you
expand it you can do it yet for my
permission you're not gonna get banned
for it anything like that spam the chat
with your favorite emojis I'm gonna give
you guys shout outs before we end the
livestream just a little token and thank
you personally from me to you for
watching the stream here on the Sunday
night or Monday morning or Monday
afternoon again depending on where you
live on the planet life streaming to the
entire planet is very weird but it's
very cool it's a privilege that I do not
take lightly and I appreciate all of you
watching even if you didn't donate you
don't need to donate to ask a question
and I hope that I got to as many of them
as I could I apologize but didn't get to
all your questions obviously I didn't I
didn't answer your question you can ask
it next week again I'll be around if you
show up in the beginning that's the time
to ask your question the most check the
comments sections I ask those as well
alright we're seeing the emojis I like
them keep them coming keep them coming
