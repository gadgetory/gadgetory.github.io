in the studio this is like has the
hardware studio here we're in Bo's dad's
woodshop and we are on day 2 which is
actually Saturday 3 days from the last
video is filming date of the desk
building process this is the second
frame here we're working on we just
drilled in the little support beams here
for the frame underneath the MDF got a
little wet on that one the autofocus is
going crazy here it's got a little
weight here so kind of bowed out MDF
does not like water keep that in mind
something like melamine would be better
for water resistance but only this
little part here got wet so we might
just roll with it for now we'll put it
in the back underneath it shouldn't see
it so we're going to place a center beam
here and that should give it a bit more
structural rigidity and if we need to
we'll add subsequent beams going this
way and one more on that side now but
we're working on shaving off just at the
end of one so we get it to fit inside
because it's it's so close you got to
get this thing almost perfect lengthwise
so that it doesn't make the frame bow
out or kind of concave in so I both bows
doing some work right now
literally half a blade like yes it's the
liver that he's trying to cut here
so our dilemma right now this is the MDF
underneath the frame and we have this is
a nail length of about an inch and a
half so the two by two we're supposed to
be a two by two is actually about an
inch and a half thick so the nail is
barely gonna reach the MDF if it even
does we might have to pre-drill and kind
of bore this out a little bit so we have
a bit more depth to work with we're just
gonna have to kind of play it by ear
because we don't have anything between
an inch and a half and I mentioned 3/4
at which point it'll basically Pierce
all the way through the MDF and ruin the
top of the table so I think our solution
is actually the solution I came up with
so if it doesn't work it's on me we're
gonna do some old-fashioned drilling
here kinda like I learned in petroleum
engineering school so this is a really
big bit it's huge it's probably like a
maybe a centimeter and a half wide and
we're gonna pre-drill some holes about
maybe a quarter of an inch down into the
frame and then we're gonna drill with a
much smaller bit all the way through
into the MDF so this should give us that
little extra breathing room to ensure
that the threads of the nail are getting
into the MDF properly I'm gonna be the
one I guess doing the you're gonna make
me do this aren't you
point it down hey wow that kids want it
down Wow
if we're given life lessons today okay
no no next don't lift all right so we've
gotta pour it out a little more next
time yes if you wanted to know guys I've
got chickens Greg already petted his
first chicken chicken I'm a little
deeper than I wanted to be well see well
we've made contact
[Laughter]
so our limo you shape is uh it's working
out grants a good to do some pre
unorthodox sawing
oh boy
we're gonna make it work that's close
enough okay so we knew that the middle
back leg would be a bit longer than it
should be because we didn't completely
shave down the part where it kind of
fits like a u-shape in between the frame
so we're gonna take a sander and sand
the crap out of that middle bottom leg
and then hopefully this will be level
afterward this will be our checking
balance right here so let's sand it and
then we'll test the structural integrity
of it by sitting on it huh this is
easily like a two-person desk but that
was the point so we could have up to
four people in the office just working
and they each have their own space
enough of it anyway okay what's going on
everyone this was supposed to be a
separate video but why not just throw it
all into one right this is all about the
desk this is the second desk the first
one is already set up I've got a bunch
of junk on it now but I wanted to show
you just like the corral construction
how we decided to put this thing
together to make it as structurally
sound as we could given our limited
knowledge in woodworking so we
originally just had it where we had five
legs and then we're being held up by
these sub frames here which are actually
not attached to the frame underneath
that's what we're calling it a sub frame
because it's really independent you can
remove the legs and keep the frame and
take the sub frame with the legs so the
sub frame is more or less to keep the
legs from rocking back and forth these
these are really sturdy here not going
anywhere
but apart from moving that sub frame up
against the frame we've also done is
added this 45 degree angle here what
this does is provide a bit more support
for the front middle of the desk which
was the weakest beforehand it's still
the weakest because not a leg there now
but this definitely helps out I
recommend you're gonna build a desk
that's anywhere near eight feet in
length and you only want four or five
legs you got to have at least one of
these we could have probably done some
some weird stuff maybe done like a cross
beam here something to make it a bit
more stable in the front but this should
be good enough we're not gonna put any
heavy PC right in the front center of
the desk now but apart from that
everything else is pretty standard what
you saw earlier in the video and I'm
going to turn this around set it all up
run some LEDs behind you for a nice back
effect and then give you an official set
up tour of the new studio
well there you have it I hope you've
enjoyed the progression up to this point
we now finally have an office with
multiple setups desks on both sides of
the room so that many people can come in
here and work on multiple things at the
same time first and foremost I want to
give a huge shout out to my good friend
beau without his help these desks would
not have been anywhere near as
structurally sound as they are and I
doubt I honestly would have even been
able to finish them how to put a
computer on top of one adjust what a
collapse Tommy at which point I'd have
just given up and bought some desks
somewhere else but for what we paid
around seventy-five to eighty bucks and
I think it came out to around 40 hours
in total labor not now it was less than
that it was like thirty hours we worked
about two or three solid days on it from
sunup to sundown we completed the desks
and I would say that I would do it again
if I had to say if I had to build two
desks or buy two desks online I would
choose to build like so many tech tubers
using the IKEA desks and that's cool and
all but I want to be different
I want to say that yeah I built that I
didn't just put a slab on top of a frame
and call it my own custom desk
these are genuinely custom they are
built by hand the wood was not you know
crafted by hand but we made the desk by
hand we used our own nails our own tools
and we cut things down to the sizes that
we wanted and I could not feel more
proud of our result I also have a call
to action for all of you I want you to
click the link at the very top of this
video's description ok you see it click
that link and it'll take you to Beau's
YouTube channel you have a gaming
channel he goes through a bunch of
different games so we review them and
talk about why he chooses what in-game
the guy he backs up what he says he's a
really good gamer as well so check out
his channel click that subscribe button
for him it'll do him a solid and he will
greatly appreciate it apart from that I
would like to know what all of you think
about the new office set up now this
isn't supposed to be the most high-tech
modern room it's just supposed to be a
productive room that's why the desks
were such an integral part of the office
set up we had to have space for multiple
pcs so that multiple people could come
in here at any time and work on whatever
they desire and if you're interested we
also have the desk specs in the video
description they're listed out the desk
are identical by the way so if you want
to just multiply everything listed there
by 2 but those are the specs for one
desk you want to build one just like
this it's good for anyone who wants to
put 2 pcs on it these will support a
hundred hundred fifty pounds if they're
built well nope
problem if you use the Wrightwood
nothing that cheap stuff that use on
fences getting little solid two-by-fours
and you should be fine there so if you
want to build a dish just like this
check out the description go to your
local hardware store and get them to cut
the wood down to size for you and you
should be on your way to having a really
productive space these desks are huge
they're very long and they're not too
wide which means that you don't take
that much space in that sense you just
put them against the wall
set some tech on top of it and be as
productive as you want to be with that
