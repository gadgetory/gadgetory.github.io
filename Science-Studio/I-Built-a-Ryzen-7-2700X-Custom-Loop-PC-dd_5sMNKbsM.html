bill I wanted to show you guys it is
this one not not Pepsi but it's this
bill and I teased it a few times on
Twitter I showed you guys a front
picture one from behind also threw it up
on Instagram and just kind of wanted to
experiment again with AMD I remember
switching in this video right here to
the horizon 7 1717 our decks actually
they're basically the same CPU so eight
cores 16 threads that was the summit
ridge architecture 14 nanometers and I
remember getting to our out 4 gigahertz
on a custom loop like this and I was a
little disappointed I expected to get a
little higher than that but I you know
it's good enough right for video editing
8 cores is more than plenty simultaneous
multi-threading all the good stuff also
on board and that's exactly what we get
here just with the step up in the right
direction from both a voltage management
perspective as well as an X and P
perspective we can actually run XMP
profile on the rise in 720 700 acts with
this you know random kit of nighthawk
ddr4 RGB modules from Team Group either
or not you know designed specifically
for rice and platforms but XMP profile
3,000 megahertz no problem here so we
got 16 gigs I might upgrade to 32
eventually that might benefit is just a
little bit in the video editing side of
things and then we have a GTX 1080 down
here which is good for CUDA acceleration
gaming all the works it's a very well
balanced system considering this is
maybe a 4 to $500 graphics card maybe a
$300 a little less than that in some
cases CPU and then 16 gigs of ram of
course the custom cooling is definitely
overkill but this is an art for me at
this point so the PC you saw at the
beginning of this video is actually at
99 setting on ATX II build with two gtx
1080s in it not one like here so I've
definitely you know dumb things down a
bit and so to speak not to say that this
isn't a powerful machine this will game
just fine it will video edit just might
as well show you here shortly but I was
having issues particularly when it came
to games with the i9 platform and I'm
not sure had to do with the CPU
architecture the latency is involved
between cores or if it had to do with
the sli config I would disable SLI and
still experience quite a bit of you know
chop when I was playing games like pub G
I usually play one or two games for a
long time maybe three four years and
then I move on to some other game that
I'll play for a long time so I commit
you know heavily to a certain game or
two and that's what I stick with
and pub G just played terribly on that
system so I was inclined to switch back
to Raisa not only because I wanted to
kind of experiment again like I said
with the 12 nanometers stuff from AMD
but also because it was just so it was
so bad I mean I could not play on that
i9 system and it was so surprising
because I system costs like $5,000
retail maybe a little more than a CPU
itself was like 2 grand but a single G
takes 10 80s really all I need for the
resolution in which I game 3440 by 1440
I had around 100 Hertz and that's more
less gonna fall on the CPU side of
things for the higher refresh rate and
eight cores is more than enough for that
if you want to stream you can also do it
on the system I don't expect you to just
want to go out and build a system like
this the custom loop is definitely not
necessary this is more of an aesthetic
play but in general this combination
here the Rison 7 platform with a gtx
1070 or 1080 is a very well balanced
system you can step down to the r5
series if you just want to play games
maybe some light multi tasking the r7
series though gives you the extra two
cores extra punch when it comes to
streaming to added workloads virtual
machines you can really come up with
several different queues for a CPU like
this content creation definitely
benefits from the extra cores as well in
most cases Premiere Pro certainly does
show a marginal benefit it's not going
to be you know a huge jump up for six
cores just because of the optimization
factor but still I would rather edit on
seven on eight core excuse me than six
cores and that is why I went with the
2700 X here I do want to point out a few
additional parts including this build
that a few of you were asking about on
Twitter so this right here is the Alpha
cool GPX in block series from alpha cool
the 1080 and 1070 blocks designed
specifically for the reference cards
that's why we again only have a single 8
pin vga supplemental power cable
stemming from the board the Alpha cool
logos upside down that's not normal it's
only because the cards turn vertically
with the liam lee vertical riser cable
card holder whatever you want to call it
now and the deltas between having this
carts that like this via the riser cable
and just being plug straight on the
motherboard are basically non-existent
which is good that means we're not
seeing a huge framerate degradation by
using the riser card which means it's a
good quality/price record there are
plenty of crap
our cards out there so beware another
thing I really wish these would turn
orange they actually do when I have the
system plugged in to my monitor and I
can control the software I thought I had
them preset to orange to begin with and
they were before I unplugged this and
put it here but these are normally
orange if that's bugging you I totally
get it the only thing that really should
be any different color or these fans up
top and I normally have these set to
white but for some reason they're purple
they might look white on camera that's
just because the cameras see slightly
different colors and we do but this is
normally white up top and then all
orange down here and then we have orange
fluid this is thermaltake fluid this is
an aluminum rad so it's important this
fluid stay Thermaltake fluid and have
more of that discussed in this video
here and then we also have some orange
dye that I just kept adding drops up
until I got the the color I was looking
for it's not gonna match identically to
the accents on the motherboard or the
RAM or the be quiet fans behind the
reservoir but it's close enough and I
think the color scheme you know fits the
bill I also want to mention the case
this is the Leanne leo 11 dynamic and
I've used it three times now for
customers because it still remains my
favorite case to this day I already
reviewed the dynamic and I think it's a
great collaboration between Lee and
Leander Bauer did a great job revising
the original PC Oh 11 and that again is
why I've thrown three custom loops into
this chassis thus far so guys let me
know what you think about the case in
particular it's very well suited for
water cooling I love the water clean
support in here and that's again another
reason why I've used it so many times
but there are just so many opportunities
in a space this big I love the way it
looks and I love the way it functions
and that's the best of both worlds when
it comes to PC cases now after a few
benchmarks with the horizon 720 700 X
and the GT X 1080 comp I can tell you
I'm very satisfied so far with the
performance again this is gonna be top
of the line here it's not gonna be as
good as an i7 8700 k GT X 1080 combo but
it's gonna be pretty darn close and I
showed that in my original benchmarks
with the r7 2700 X so again 8 cores
simultaneous multithreading 4.2 ish
gigahertz overclock in most cases if you
pair that with Ram that you can run an X
and B profile you can have a very good
system not only from a power delivery
standpoint because the voltage
tolerances on the CPU are actually
really good for what they are with the
new fabrication note at 12 nanometers
but also because it runs pretty cool so
the entire loop actually with the Pumped
er down to the lowest setting possible
and my fan curves as you can hear now
are very quiet the CPU only reaches
about 55 degrees Celsius under full load
that's incredible and in the graphics
curve which is about 60 degrees Celsius
while gaming so that's really all I have
to say at this point games run a lot
snappier now there they're not lagging
there's no huge framerate dip at all
when I play with this system versus when
I played with the I 9 system I think
that has to do with the I 9s
architecture not so much to do with
AMD's you know increase in IPC which is
pretty marginal but they did increase
the voltage tolerances the temperatures
are much more stable now and we can get
a slightly higher overclock XMP profile
overclocking memory it's all much more
doable now with the horizon second gen
stuff so maybe something to consider I
know that the Rison 7 1700 is still an
epic deal right now especially when you
get up around 200 bucks it's really hard
to say no to a 200 dollar 8 core CPU
that's relatively modern but if you no
exit view profiles a big deal to you if
you plan on running higher frequency
memory which will affect your frame rate
when it comes to the Infinity fabric and
the architecture behind summit ridge and
and the newer 12 nanometers stuff then
giving the second gen Rison 7 and Rison
5 CPU is a try it might be in your
PlayBook so it's something to consider I
have both the 2700 X and the 1700 a
linked down below the horizon 720 709 X
by the way would still be a viable
counterpart although because I'm custom
cooling this I want the extra TDP
Headroom just in case I get a small you
know marginal overclock benefit from it
maybe like another 100 or 200 megahertz
I'm gonna try for 4.4 gigahertz with
this one although I'm not sure we're
gonna have the thermal Headroom because
this is a very slim 360 mil rat well
we'll play around with it but for now
I'm very comfortable at 4.2 gigahertz
across all eight cores so what do you
guys think about the build I want to
hear from you in the comments below what
would you change about it what would you
keep in it if you took this bill home
two days or anything that would
immediately drive you insane that you
would have to change right away I want
to know what you would do differently
because I might take your idea and
implement it into a future custom Lou
but I do this for fun now you know a lot
not a lot of people are interested in
custom loops now because they're so
expensive and I know times are hard and
you know people are fighting for for
cash
and trying to spend it as wisely as
possible and that's a good thing
you know custom loops are a very niche
art for a very select few people not
necessarily because they have the money
for it because they they appreciate the
art enough to want to spend the money on
it so this is something that I would
maybe do once or twice in my life if I
had to spend all my money on this stuff
you know I couldn't do it more than a
couple times just because it would be
very expensive so you know we all have
bills to pay I am happy with the way
this looks I'm happy with the stuff in
it and yeah if I wanted to build a
custom book right now out of my own
pocket
then I would build something very
similar to this maybe a white themed
build just because I like white better
when it comes to RGB accents and the
reflections and stuff but I wanted to
change it up a bit I wanted to go black
and orange not because I'm a line of
shill but because I want to be different
thumbs up if you liked the video if you
liked the bill dislike it if you feel
cope it opposite or if you hate
everything about life click that red
subscribe button if you haven't already
and stay tuned for a more content like
this this is science studio thanks for
building with us are you ok pecci are
you ok do you want to say hi to the
people on YouTube do you want to say hi
no I don't think she wants to say hi
instead she's gonna buy cables don't
don't nobody do it she's going to buy
the cable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
