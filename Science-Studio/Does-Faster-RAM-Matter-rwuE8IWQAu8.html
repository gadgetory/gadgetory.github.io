6600 K and the 4690k to the video which
you can check out right here a few of
you claimed that it was somehow unfair
of me to downgrade my ddr4 frequency to
2133 megahertz to be in line with my
ddr3 frequency also at 21 33 megahertz
you claimed that an increase in ddr4
frequency would have yielded much better
results for the 6600 K and therefore
gaming benchmarks and CPU synthetic
benchmarks would have been you know much
better so we would have yielded higher
margins in performance on both the
gaming and CPU synthetic sides of our
test so in this video we're going to put
that theory to the test does an increase
in ddr4 frequency actually yield an
increase in both gaming and CPU
synthetic tests the test bench for this
video will of course consist of the 6600
K and MSI z170a gaming pro motherboard
and 2 4 gigabyte sticks of a mixer blitz
ddr4 factory clocked to 2800 megahertz
the only variable that will change
during the course of this video will be
the frequency at which our ddr4 operates
so originally we ran all of our tests at
2800 megahertz and then I went into the
BIOS and manually down clock the RAM
frequency to 20 133 megahertz the
process isn't very difficult all depend
on your motherboard click a button
that'll send you into your BIOS go into
the overclock Tweaker it's what is
usually called and then manually set
your ddr4 frequency to whatever its
stock frequency is don't try to
overclock it because you're gonna get
into some trouble
you're gonna really tweak with your
voltages your Layton sees to get an
overclock with Ram I don't recommend
doing that but you can very easily under
clock RAM which is what I did in this
particular clip right here so with that
the way we ran four separate tests two
of them being CPU synthetic and two of
them being games let's go ahead and see
what the results were
you
okay so first up in the case of
Cinebench there really isn't much of a
difference at all to be seen however
Cinebench mostly depends on the number
of cores you have and the number of
threads you have and the frequency at
which your CPU operates not necessarily
frequency at which your RAM operates so
I can't really say that there's any
surprise here however in the case of
Geekbench 3 there was a noticeable
difference between both the multi-core
and single core scores our twenty eight
hundred megahertz platform received
about 500 extra points and the
multi-core side of things and about 200
extra points in the single core side of
thing so you could argue that in tasks
where Ram is more heavily involved
obviously you will start to see those
added benefits the first of our two
games was dirt rally and I would
generally regard dirt rally as more of a
GPU intensive game than anything else
and that definitely shows in these
graphs you really can't discern much of
a difference at all between our higher
clock Ram platform and our lower clock
ram in fact really only about a 1 FPS
difference on the averages would be
completely unnoticeable during gameplay
so a lot of the GPU intensive games
really won't benefit from this faster
Ram however things change in the case of
GTA 5 pretty much as always ha just
kidding really if things don't change it
all for GTA 5 even though GTA 5 is much
more CPU intensive in fact we really
only see once again about a 1 FPS
increase on the average side of things
and about a 2 to 3 FPS increase on the
maxes and mins so just because GT 5 is a
very CPU intensive game this does not
mean that an increase in ddr4 frequency
is going to yield noticeable frame per
second increases they're just not
directly correlated there are many many
other factors that play a role here in
fact most of these variables are almost
solely dependent on your graphics card
so whatever your vram frequency is and
whatever your GPU frequencies are can
dramatically affect the frame rates that
you see in most of your games so let's
clear things up for a second when I
decided to run identical frequencies for
both my ddr3 and ddr4 platforms I'm
really not changing much at all in fact
in the case of my FX 6300 verse I 3 6100
video of which you can check out right
here
I received a ton of backlash from people
who said that whoa whoa whoa you use
different frequencies for ddr3 and ddr4
that is not fair at all
there really is
going too much of a difference if I
decided to run ddr3 at 21 33 megahertz
these tests alone prove that so that's
the myth I want to get off of this
channel ddr4 and ddr3 frequencies don't
make much of a difference at all
especially when you decide the game or
even when you're just doing simple tasks
on your computer I personally by faster
Ram only because I've video at it all
the time and that is a place in which
you will notice the difference between
ddr3 and ddr4 and the differences in
frequencies but other than that if all
you is game or just surf the web YouTube
whatever all of those tasks will not
benefit from faster RAM at least in any
noticeable way unless you decide to
nitpick and say oh well one FPS is an
increase
that's justifiable for me maybe it is
for you I'm not really going to argue
that but the results are here for you
all to see and I would like to hear what
you have to say about these results in
the comments below keep in mind that I
did not change any caste Layton sees and
we use the gtx 960 and all these tests I
know I should have said that upfront but
that is that's the state of these
benchmarks here so let me know in the
comments below what you think be sure to
