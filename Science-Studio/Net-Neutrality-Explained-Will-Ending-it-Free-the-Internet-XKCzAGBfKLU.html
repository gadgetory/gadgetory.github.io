argument and I try to stay out of
politics on a largely science derived
channel but nothing about net neutrality
needs to be political I'm gonna give you
in this video a synopsis of what the
current net neutrality rules dictate why
you have the free internet that you have
and what things might look like if the
net neutrality laws were repealed in a
nutshell net neutrality refers to our
rights as occupants of the United States
to open an unrestricted networks ISP
other internet service providers are
lawfully bound to provide unrestricted
access to all web sites deemed lawful in
the eyes of the government basically
everything that doesn't violate US or
international law the rights of others
or rights of corporations ISPs are not
allowed to choke or bar mirror you
access to any website the u.s. deems
lawful that's basically any website that
doesn't sell things that are illegal or
show things that are illegal those are
the two main things I can think of at
this point so if my current service
provider Wow one of the two is PS and
Panama City decided to suddenly ignore
net neutrality altogether what they
could do is bar me from certain websites
that can bar me from competitors
anything NBC related comes to mind so
xfinity comcast there's news outlets
that could also restrict access or
throttle access to sites like Netflix
Hulu and even YouTube in 2015 the FCC
that's the Federal Communications
Commission classified broadband
providers like Verizon Comcast
CenturyLink and AT&amp;amp;T as title to common
carriers this means that in the eyes of
common law ISPs are simply the mediums
of exchange the carriers of information
between the infrastructure because
nobody owns the Internet and the
consumer and it makes sense think of it
like a mail delivery system if you PS
was suddenly bound by mail neutrality
laws then they wouldn't be able to show
preference to certain neighborhoods as
in neighborhoods it may be look really
nice they're nice to drive through they
look really great they have large big
yards and huge fences and four or five
stories of peace those are the
neighborhoods that UPS chooses deliver
to first and they may not even get to
the the older more run-down poor
neighborhoods because they're just you
know they don't feel like doing it so
those people in the poor places might
not even get their packages on time
might not even get them the same day or
the same week in fact UPS without mail
neutrality could decide
- just not deliver the packages at all
at which point what would you do use
FedEx or USPS but then what if both of
them as well decided to not deliver to
your place what would you what would you
do how would you were send or receive
packages that's what would happen if
mail neutrality suddenly disappeared now
we don't have those laws obviously USPS
FedEx UPS want your business and there's
a decent and a healthy amount of
competition there but with ISPs where
competition is literally non-existent in
some places it becomes a huge problem
now obviously we have the option to pay
more for two-day and overnight shipping
but all mail neutrality requires in this
hypothetical situation is that those
packages shipped within each price and
bracket be delivered without bias toward
particular neighborhoods the same is
true for ISPs under net neutrality I pay
about 80 bucks a month for cable and 500
Meg's down and I have a friend who pay
60 bucks for cable and a hundred Meg's
down I expect a 500 megabyte per second
cap when I download content I know I
won't always get 500 Meg's but I expect
it to be evenly distributed across all
websites I visit my friend expects 100
in the same light simple as that but
what we don't expect is to be throttled
when we visit sites deemed less
important or conflicting in the eyes of
our provider one reason that neutrality
is such a hot-button topic right now
apart from the fact that legislation my
team at Nolen void a few months or years
is that people are getting frustrated
with their current ISPs if you're
watching up to this point the video I
want you to comment down below with your
available internet service providers in
your area and then take a look at a few
others above and below you you'll find
that quite a number of people have
access to only one or two providers
without pricing strategies under a
competitive model these monopolies
essentially can charge whatever they
want for cable is seen in South Park has
never been more accurate because it's
your local cable company the customer is
always our if net neutrality was
suddenly repealed or even eased back to
some degree things may look very
different online and here's a scarier
part they might look different for both
you and I if we're in different areas
because we have different ISPs that's
super sketchy that's literally
censorship and that's why net neutrality
is so important to our infrastructure we
rely on open and free access to
information untampered and uncensored
but if things continue down this road we
may have access to only a couple of news
media
it's local stations and websites and
since most people are bound to their
current ISP they won't have a choice
about what they can or can't see I'll
leave you with this
this is mr. Ajit pie chairman of the FCC
the one spearheading net neutrality
repeals he was previously a Verizon
lawyer Verizon is the second largest
Internet service provider in the United
States now I've never been a proponent
of big government intervention this
touches in politics and I'll stop here
but I'm 100% against mr. Pie's argument
that repealing net neutrality quote puts
engineers and entrepreneurs instead of
bureaucrats and lawyers back in charge
of the internet end quote
despite whatever he or the FCC says
about current net neutrality rules I am
contented with what I have now I'm not
in fear of any throttling at all for any
web site that I visit and that's how it
should be it's free open access to
information without restrictions I
shouldn't have to pay more to visit
Netflix than I do to visit Amazon
because Amazon is owned by my ISP or
maybe Amazon and my ISP or buddy-buddy
and they hate Netflix and decide to
throttle Netflix or make me pay a lot
more for access to it that could also
happen under repeal the net neutrality
rules if we suddenly had corporations
like Verizon AT&amp;amp;T Xfinity and Wow saying
well we prefer to use our on-demand
systems over Netflix and Hulu we're just
gonna charge you a bit more for Netflix
than what netflix already charges you if
you want access to it from our service
that's the really messed up stuff it's
big business taking advantage of the
infrastructure they have to charge you
more money so that they can get guess
what
bigger I'm not trying to scare you into
believing Miam I actually encourage you
to do this research yourself this video
is more less a call to action and
bringing to light this very concerning
topic you might not be able to see me in
six months to a year you might have to
pay more to see me six months to a year
from now YouTube should be free right
included with the access to the Internet
you pay your service provider but you
might have to pay a little more to get
access to YouTube a scary thought if you
like this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
