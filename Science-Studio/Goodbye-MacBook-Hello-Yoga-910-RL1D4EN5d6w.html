for me I'm sure most of you are fairly
excited about that I'm gonna go ahead
and roll the unboxing footage right now
okay so I've never done an official
unboxing video if you will on the
channel it's usually not my thing but
for this particular product this laptop
here I think it's going to be really
cool this is a special edition yoga 9/10
comes with an i7 7500 ukb Lake processor
yes I finally have a cable a clap top 16
gigabytes of ddr4 I believe this isn't
low power ddr3 the extra of ddr4
soldered on the board 512 gigabytes of
solid-state storage and a 4k I think
it's IPS display so I pointed out the
special edition because the guys at Best
Buy we're telling me that there are
approximately 5000 of these I think
they're exactly 5000 of them
Best Buy gets about 3,000 of them and
they don't really know what number out
of 5000 this is the cool thing is they
actually have it engraved on the laptop
itself just underneath the shift key on
the left side of the keyboard so it's
going to be cool to just open this up
and figure out what number we are out of
5000 who knows we could be you know
something really low something really
high maybe even one that would be really
cool so we're going to go ahead and
unbox it just kind of get a feel for
build quality in general and overall
responsiveness check out that limited
edition number and we have on our laptop
and let's just go over a few other specs
things that I notice right off the bat
and that'll be the end of this first
unboxing video let me know in the
comments if you like this style video
I'm not going to make it a normal habit
on the channel but every now and then I
think it's kind of cooled it to shift
gears and do something like this ok this
is the laptop itself put this to the
side so what else is in the box here
nope okay wow so this whole thing is
just kind of one big unique you see how
it's and I just stuck on there it's all
one large piece see what's in here
large looks like charging cable yeah
nice big brick right there on the end 45
watt look straight into the wall it
doesn't look like you can convert this
and another thing you'll notice USB
type-c and you can't see from way up
there this is a Type C power connector
it's not Thunderbolt 3 unless you're
getting the same data transfer rates as
USB 3.1 wow this is like a short little
power extender that's kind of nice
because I looked at this and I didn't
think this was enough cable this looks
like to be about 6 feet or so
I prefer around 8 or 9 so this looks
like it add another couple feet slide on
out another cool thing about the the
special edition yoga 910 here the glass
this is a glass back it's probably not
no we're joking at Best Buy it's
probably not Corning Gorilla Glass or
anything like that it would suck to drop
something like this but it is a very
nice aesthetic kind of puts it in line
with the you know higher-end laptops
like the mac books and even the XPS
lineup okay we ready for this we're
going to open it up for the first time
see what number of the special edition
that we have
759 out of 4,000 that's pretty cool
that's only 4,000 not 5,000 it's really
nice well this thing booted up the first
time in like six seconds especially
you're coming from a laptop that doesn't
have a solid-state drive in there with
your operating system installed on that
these boot times are going to be
life-changing for you not as fast as my
macbook first different operating system
different things in play there but
overall still very snappy this is my
first Windows laptop of our own with a
solid-state drive so super cool to see
Windows 10 boot up that's quick Wow so
much legal stuff oh my this this reminds
me of that South Park episode I always
get a little a little nervous here
this hinge is beautiful I mean it's so
rigid you would think that something
like this just wouldn't be very sturdy
doesn't look very sturdy but it really
is I mean look at that the screen I mean
the screen itself probably weighs you
know half a pound and it's just it's
just keeping it just like that and
definitely here those fans I know you
can't hear it just from my microphone
but they're there it's a big change from
the MacBook 2016 which was passively
cooled not the probe which is the
12-inch MacBook I have this this gets
hot it's already actually pretty hot up
here that's probably where the CPU is
here the fan
so yeah I mean big change there it's it
kind of sucks having to hear fan but
that's what you're getting with a core
i7 grain it's not an HQ it's not a quad
core processor but this thing does turbo
up to I believe 3.5 gigahertz which is
fairly high for a modern laptop grade
processor so I imagine it is getting
fairly hot we'll run some tests in the
official benchmarking video but I can
definitely tell this thing's putting off
some heat all right check that out I
tell you what the 4k screen yeah I
thought the retina display looked good
I'm not sure what the PPI differences
here and I don't know if I mentioned
this earlier actually didn't realize
this either until I got into the store
and started playing with one it is
touchscreen as well so that's super cool
I'm going to be kind of weird having a
double tap to open something up it's
just a nice added feature for Windows 10
Windows 10 is a bit more friendly when
it comes to the whole touchscreen
interface using like Windows 7 or
Windows Vista with touchscreen would
just be disastrous so that's it's a it's
a perk okay keyboard first impressions
nice keyboard
I like the tactile feedback that you get
on these on these keys big change from
the MacBook but something that I don't
like the one thing that I've found so
far that I don't like this shift key all
right now I know why they made the shift
key so small it's just because they
wanted to make room for full-size arrow
keys it's a trade-off I understand that
I would prefer the shorter more squished
arrow keys up and down and a longer
shift key so that's just preferential I
have never owned a keyboard on any I
mean I've never owned a laptop that has
a keyboard with a really small shift key
like this it's really difficult when I'm
reaching with my with my my pinky way
over here to the right I keep wanting to
click the arrow key instead of the shift
key so that's that's a trade-off that
I'm not too happy about but everything
else I didn't realize that by the way
until I started typing but everything
else feels great the keys are spaced out
nicely they are a bit smaller than what
I'm used to and I'm not sure why exactly
that is but they're contoured nicely got
your home keys the indentions everything
spaced out appropriately so maybe
slightly larger keys
and this shift key change over here
those are the two things that I would
fix about this keyboard okay so you have
two different LED backlight modes so you
can function spacebar at once it'll turn
them off if you do it again a very very
subtly lit like suddenly it's not a word
but they're just just barely visible the
lights are barely on the background a
doubt you can yeah you can barely see it
on the camera and then we do it once
more and they're much much brighter
another cool thing about the yoga I mean
it kind of makes sense why it's called
that the entire laptop kind of folds
over on itself and that's thanks to
these looks like little watch band
hinges there's six of them here and as I
was saying a bit earlier they're very
sturdy I mean like you can just you can
literally hold this screen at any angle
and with a 4k screen like this I mean
it's going to be it's going to blow any
tablet away in terms of screen quality
will be a bit hot but other than that I
do think that it's nice to have a laptop
like this you know if you just wanted to
be a have a smaller footprint maybe
you're just on an airplane or something
you're just chilling out then this is
certainly an option you can pursue and
another cool thing when you flip it over
obviously going to be worried about that
keyboard on the back right pushing all
those buttons I believe that the
keyboard turns off when you flip the
screen around like this so you don't
worry about pushing any keys or anything
like that and that messing up whatever
software you're running you can just you
know mess with all of them no big deal
the keyboard is deactivated
now the fingerprint sensor is something
I was a little unsure didn't know if it
was going to be you know what those
instant response fingerprint scanners or
if it was going to take a long time or
I'd have to you know swipe my finger
over or something like that I've never
run a laptop like this that had a
fingerprint scanner on it like that but
it was super instantaneous the first
time I used it and it's been pretty much
the same ever since then every time I
press my finger on there it's immediate
it's it's it's such a quick response I'm
so surprised it's actually quicker than
my iPhone 7s fingerprint scanner so that
kind of gives you an idea of how fast it
is you will be impressed with this the
bezel is display is gorgeous I was
debating bidding at XPS 13 just because
I do love the infinity display on on
those laptops but the
that I could get this much packed into a
PC that cost less than something that
wasn't going to be up to par in terms of
specs I decided to go with the Lenovo it
is a bit bigger and it does have an
odd-looking chin the bottom of this of
this device does have a fairly large
bezel the cameras down there that's a
good old chin cam I have a solution for
that though that I saw on someone else's
YouTube channel now they were reviewing
this and they said there's a quick way
to just remedy that situation it's
actually super simple fix but so that
that's not going to be a big issue I do
love the flexibility of it you know you
can't bend an XPS 13 all the way around
so you can't really treat it like a
tablet in that sense either I will admit
it is nice jumping back into Windows 10
for my mobile computing experience I do
miss the fluidity of OS 10 I think that
the MacBook did handle that well
considering how limited it was by the
core m3 which is still mind you a
dual-core hyper threaded processor the
16 gigs was something that I that I
really wanted because I will be using
this for my mobile editing so when I
want to upload a video on the go
I'll have this to handle Adobe Premiere
not something that I would want 4k
footage to be edited on and even 1080p
60fps will be a challenge the rendering
times on this laptop won't be stellar
nothing close to what my editing rate
does behind me but at least I can still
use Adobe Premiere Pro now Final Cut Pro
was good in its own way that it rendered
videos super fast because it rendered in
the background as I was editing every
now and then I posted just a timestamp
on Twitter telling you how quickly my
MacBook uploaded a 10 or 15 minute video
file usually takes like 5 or 6 minutes
which which I would argue is faster than
that the problem is I don't have all of
the tools that I necessarily need on
Final Cut Pro Adobe Premiere is just in
my opinion the best all-around video
editor for someone like myself who
uploads YouTube videos and I I do miss
that when I'm on the MacBook so that's
one of the big reasons why I bought this
laptop if you're wondering why I didn't
stick with the MacBook so the other
question I want to answer is why I chose
this laptop and not something like an
XPS 13
and the answer to that is well
considering what I paid for this I think
this is the best bang for the buck
currently now Best Buy as far as I know
is the only retail store currently
running this kind of sale but this
laptop normally retails for sixteen
hundred bucks which is roughly what the
Dell XPS 13 retails for given similar
specs I don't know if you get 16 gigs of
random 512 s SD with that XPS 13 price
but when I saw this I knew right away
that this was going to be the best deal
I could find and after i meanit's it
that's after Black Friday and Cyber
Monday I was looking I didn't see any
deals that were this competitive daring
those holidays if you will so it's it's
kind of no it's a little strange that
these tech deals aren't really following
suit with with the Cyber Monday and and
Black Friday shenanigans like they have
in the past if you're wondering what I
would compare this to I've played with
other laptops of course I've had my
MacBook this is I would say if my
MacBook is a 10 out of 10 with build
quality which it is it's really even if
you don't like Apple the MacBook is
built very nicely even if I give that a
10 out of 10 this is pretty darn close
I'd say a 9 maybe 9.2 you know it's up
there it's not a 7 or an 8 there's I
mean there's no plastic on this device
the glass on the back here now I
mentioned that a bit earlier this glass
is just beautiful I would rather have
this on the back then something like
solid aluminum like the MacBook does not
and even the inside it's not
carbon-fiber like the XPS lineup is but
I I do like the aluminum it's brushed
all the way one solid piece even the
touchpad is I'm not even kidding here
the touchpad is macbook quality it feels
great you just you know you just glide
all over the touchpad I do miss the
little taptic engine you know you can't
click everywhere on it but you can just
tap it instead you don't get any
feedback that way but you still do get a
response on screen overall though my
first impressions are very positive and
I know it's kind of easy to say that
being that I'd spent this much money on
the laptop I get it but if I had any
sort of remorse whatsoever I would just
probably return it and I'm not going to
do that because this this is just
well-built it's
beautiful-looking it is a lot larger
than the MacBook it's going to take some
getting used to the speakers aren't as
good but like I said overall it's just a
good laptop I have the link to this
product in the video's description I
think I have the Amazon link if it's all
sold on Amazon enough it is name of this
exact model but I have one similar to
that on Amazon that's my affiliate link
I get a kickback if you buy something
from there and then I'll also post the
Best Buy ad for this laptop I don't know
how long that sale is going to be
running so click on the link if you're
watching this around the time it's been
uploaded and you know jump on that if
you if you're interested in something
like this I don't know if this stills
going to last very long at all so that's
why when I first saw it today I went out
and purchased it right away I knew that
this was going to be something that that
I would want 4k screen the KB Lake i7
7500 u runs things just fine so far I
haven't had any hiccups any problems any
lag we'll see if that continues I'll
upload my I guess overall general
impressions of the laptop talk about the
pros and cons later on maybe a month or
so from now once I get a feel for for
everything this laptop has and what it
does and what it's good at and what it's
not
then I'll upload that video there maybe
compare it to my 12-inch MacBook do a
video rendering test something like that
if you have any questions concerns be
sure to leave those in the comments
below give this video a thumbs up
because out of school give it a dislike
if you field a bit opposite for whatever
reason or if you hate everything about
life be sure to click I subscribe but if
you haven't already to stay tuned I
guess I'm going to review this since
sitting here for quite a while but I
think I want to review it now it's super
heavy but it's a very powerful cooler
you'll see that in those benchmarks
