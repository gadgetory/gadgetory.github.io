240 exa io check out the link in the
video description for more details you
asked for a minute science video that
lasts exactly one minute so here's how a
computer works the heart of any computer
is also its brain and that's the central
processing unit to execute stored
programs commands using billions of
transistors to sort through trillions of
lines of binary code and since binary
involves two states open and closed it's
easy for transistors to discern between
the two with a single threshold voltage
random access memory is also a vital
component of any PC it allows for
temporary and speedy storage and access
to some data the process is quicker than
any hard disk or solid-state drive
because it's immediately at the CPUs
disposal the graphics processing unit
either integrated or discrete is in
charge of transcribing the data sent
from the CPU into on-screen dynamic
pictures individual pixels must be
assessed and shaded simultaneously which
is why graphics processors incorporate
thousands of cores for parallel
processing most dedicated cards have
their own RAM and power delivery systems
much like modern motherboards speaking
of which the motherboard acts as the
unifier the highway between the CPU Ram
and discrete graphics processor
information fed from RAM and storage
devices is executed by the CPU and
translated by the graphics card into a
physical image power is distributed to
the CPU mainboard peripherals and
graphics card from a power supply with
dedicated rails for unique voltage
requirements usually 12 volts for
anything major and 5 volts for
peripherals
