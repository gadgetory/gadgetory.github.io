HBM and gddr5 and for that matter
HBM to and GTD are 5x welcome to our
crash course playlist so HBM our high
bandwidth memory in its essence is a
form of stackable memory designed to
reduce power consumption and ramp up
data transfer rates the first of hbm's
coin was implemented in the r9 nano fury
in fury x with HP m2 which allows twice
the number of transfers as the first
generation will get more into detail
with that in a second here thrown into
the latest vega cards it's a largely AMD
venture but should be noted that Nvidia
is p100 tesla card also boasts HBM to
the primary physical difference between
HBM and gddr5 that you need to know is
that the latter is scattered around the
GPU on the PCB most graphics cards from
early Nvidia and AMD up through the 1080
TI are set up this way the primary
difference between gddr5 X and gddr5
being the doubled bandwidth made
possible in part by a quad data rate
interface rather than a double data rate
one found in regular old ddr5 every time
the data rate is doubled the number of
clock signals must double and to achieve
11 gigabits per second without insane
noise and jitter levels was no simple
task for micron but as taxing is this
was in the production phase PCB
modifications required for gddr5 X
integration or minimal 190 pins are used
by single chips versus 170 and the older
gen but a parent positioning didn't
change so this alteration is nowhere
near as costly as HBM integration which
we'll talk about a second in a nutshell
here gddr5 X utilizing quad data rate
signaling should actually be called gqd
r5 but you can see why they tacked on
the X instead now we're gddr5 modules
are physically scattered around the
graphics processor HBM dyes are
extremely close to the GPU actually on
the package itself DRAM dyes are stacked
atop a controller to form an HB a module
which is connected to the GPU via and
imposer
between the two 1,024 data links exist
assuming 4 stack DRAM dies per module
each with 2 128 channels per die every
HB in package boasts 8 channels at 128
times 8 equals 1024 bits if the graphics
card in question has 4 HB m stacks then
the memory bus of the card is 1020
four times four equals 4096 bits this
provides cards with HBM and insane
memory bandwidth HBM 2 which is found in
Vega and the P 100 essentially doubles
the pin transfer rate of HP m1 and also
allows for much more storage per unit
the r9 fury exxon HBM 1 for example was
limited to 1 gigabyte per stack which is
why it was only a 4 gigabyte card it
only had 4 HBM stacks with HB m 2 8
gigabytes is a much simpler feat and in
the case of Vega 56 only two stacks
exist on the package so let's calculate
AMD's Vega 56 memory bandwidth as an
example the arbitrary numbers can get
kind of confusing total bandwidth what
you see on graphics card manufacturer
websites like this here is the product
of base DRAM clock speed memory bus
width and bytes and the number of
interfaces jump back a minute or two in
this video if you need to review the
variables in this equation the equation
itself is very simple but the
terminology can be quite confusing this
step was simplified with great help from
Steve over at gamers Nexus by the way
I've linked a few of their articles that
are tied to this topic at hand in the
video description so huge thanks to him
and his team over there
so as mentioned multiply the 4 values
attached to Vegas HBM to clock speed 800
megahertz memory bus width at 2048 bits
divided by 8 to get 256 bytes and the
number of interfaces at 2 for 2 modules
on the package memory bandwidth equals
four hundred and ten roughly gigabytes
per second as such you can see how
changing the clock speed of the memory
has a direct impact on memory bandwidth
at 945 megahertz for example bandwidth
jumps up to roughly 484 gigabytes per
second the primary benefits of HP m2 are
rooted in power and frequency
optimizations since memory pathways are
extremely short power consumption is
lower than that for gddr5 but that's not
the full story since each bus is much
wider packets can operate at much lower
frequencies and maintain comparable or
even higher memory bandwidth than gddr5
counterparts lower frequency equals
lower input voltage and there's your
efficiency parameter but it's no secret
that HBM is a costly venture printed
circuit boards are much cheaper by
comparison which is why gddr5 has been
so feasible for so long and the
production of GDD are 6 leaves us
questioning the viability of HBM in the
first place Ami's often been the guinea
pig for new and exciting technologies
we'll see you soon though if HBM 2
actually pays off for now with a general
consumer need
- no is it cards with HBM typically
result in smaller form factors in her
marginally lower power consumption cards
though not the case with Vega both gddr5
and HB and bandwidths are sufficient for
gaming you'd be hard-pressed to tell the
difference in literally any scenario so
the real benefit of HB mla in its small
design useful especially for VR
applications this topic was brought to
you by one of your fellow twitter
followers be sure to thank them for that
I ran a survey and the remaining three
videos in the crash course series or
actually maybe minutes science series it
really depends on how long the video is
end up being will be arriving soon on
the channel I'm still working on getting
those scripts together because a lot of
this stuff I have to do research for
which is why at the end of every video I
say thanks for learning with us because
I don't know most of the stuff going
into it I like to learn and I'm glad
that you all like to as well that's why
this channel exists so if you like this
video be sure to give it a thumbs up
thumbs down for the opposite click
subscribe button if you haven't already
and stay tuned for more content like
this
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
