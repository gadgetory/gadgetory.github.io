8700 KS with this video will focus on
we're gonna run some synthetics and
we're also gonna run some gaming
benchmarks to justify what you saw in
the title now unlike other tech channels
out that we're not going to waste time
talking about how it's the same 14 enemy
to process how they just stuck two extra
cores into a slightly larger die this is
a just a benchmarking video you want to
see the numbers here they go and we very
briefly have to talk about the platform
specs so of course we have 8700 K that's
paired with a gigabyte Z 370 gaming 7
motherboard and 16 gigabytes of corsair
dominator Platinum's running at 3,000
megahertz paired with a gtx 1080 TI a
reference card to spice things up though
I've thrown in two extra sets of
benchmarks for comparison sake so I have
the 6700 K which is the earliest
rendition of 14 enemy 2 architectures we
can see how far we've come in two or
three years I haven't been keeping up
with the times but I think it's been
that long and then I also have a lower
clock run of the 8700 K for all of its
benchmarks to see ok if you want to just
keep it low at around 4.6 gigahertz
which is it's hard to believe it that's
a low frequency but it is for the 8700 K
then we'll have that clock for clock
comparison between the 8700 K and the
6700 K at 4.6 gigahertz and the 8700 K
at 5 gigahertz which is certainly
attainable are you ready here we go I'd
like to start things off with Cinebench
r15 just a raw CPU horsepower comparison
here the 6700 K scored just over a
thousand points of 188 on the single
core score the 8700 K the same clock
speed scored thirteen hundred and
seventy this is most likely due to the
extra core count though the frequency
here in the IPC jump isn't playing much
of a roll we can see that our single
core scores 191 vs. 188 is not
reminiscent of a huge IPC jump but what
do you expect I keep wanting to say
Canon like by the way but that's 10
nanometers that's that's coming soon
this is still the same 14 nanometer
architecture and the 8700 K at 5
gigahertz is scoring 1610 so a pretty
solid boost jumping just 400 megahertz
up and the single core score also jumped
to 214 pretty similar story with
Geekbench 4 can see all three CPUs
scored within around 2 or 300 points of
each other the 8700 K actually scored a
bit lower clock for clock than the 6700
K did on the single core score which is
a bit weird maybe optimisation has to
play a role
there but it did surpass the 6700 K
thanks to its 2 extra cores at 24,000
and 59 points and then 5 gigahertz the
87 case scored 28,000 which is actually
only about 2000 points away from the
high nine 7900 X so pretty incredible
the CPU not being anywhere above 350 s
US dollars this is a pretty sweet score
we're getting a lot of performance out
of a chip that is still on the consumer
grade platform next up I run a
five-minute 1080p 60fps video file
through the Adobe premier encoder the
Youtube 1080p preset was selected and
the 6700 K is scored a time of 258
seconds remember lower is better here
the faster the render time the better
the 8700 K the same clock speed scored
214 seconds and the 87 or K at 5
gigahertz scored 188 seconds this mind
he was not far off at all from my
overclocked 7900 X CPU now let's jump
into the games I always start with GTA 5
in these cases because it's a pretty
good balance of both GPU and CPU
horsepower especially in a resolution
like 1440p with toggle set to very high
and no anti-aliasing or advanced
graphics the 8700 K at 5 gigahertz which
Grand Theft Auto loves that high
frequency scored a FPS of 155 on average
144 for the 4.6 gig run and the 6700 K
scored 140 so the difference between the
two at the same frequency is pretty much
negligible and that carries over to the
1% end point one percent lows as well
testing doom in volc√°n at 1440p use in
the ultra preset resulted in pretty
sweet performance for the 8700 k 5
gigahertz 144 FPS it did cap out many
times at around a hundred and eighty
nine I believe and you can see that our
1% in point one percent lows were
identical between the two CPUs at
different frequencies the 6700 K was a
bit lower across the board but I don't
think this is anything worth splitting
hairs over onto witcher 3 which is a
more graphics court intensive game i was
actually surprised here to find that the
overclocked 8700 K at 5 gigahertz scored
the highest across the board I thought
things would be pretty stale here the
GTA 5 tests were pretty stale witcher 3
actually turned things around a bit so
the 87 okay 5 gigahertz
one across the board at 4.6 it was still
ahead of the 6700 K which scored the
lowest considerably also point one
percent lowest for the 67 RK were a lot
lower than the other two so this might
be a core utilization issue on to
universe and box 2 at 14
DPS and the ultra preset and the earth
and many moons simulation which really
stresses the CPU more on that in this
video right here the 8700 K did perform
much better than the 67 ok that's kind
of what we should expect with a
six-course CPU that is at a higher
frequency than the four core counterpart
while whopping 78 FPS on average the
huge jump from 50 for the 6700 K the 1%
end point where % loads were also higher
for the 5 gigahertz 8700 K run on now to
pub G which is without a doubt still in
the development phase but it's worth
testing because I for the life of me
cannot get this game to run it over 100
FPS I don't know what's going on I
thought the 8700 K would fix this
especially at 5 gigahertz but it didn't
happen we did see some small performance
jumps especially with the extra 2 cores
on board but this this game is just
still in need of some desperate
optimization we can reap the full
benefits of our CPUs and GPUs in this
game last on the list is planet coaster
I did this one more or less just for fun
because I really liked roller coaster
tycoon take him to even tycoon 3 it was
a bit harder to get used to but I come
to is my favorite and planet coaster is
a really nice modern rendition of that
game
so I ran both CPUs and the three
different presets in this game and we
still couldn't hit 100 FPS on average
which is pretty surprising to me but I
really like this game I'm actually into
the description it's not being sponsored
in any way I just genuinely enjoy
playing it so it's something that you
should probably check out if you would
like to roller coaster tycoon 96 FPS for
the 8700 K at 5 gigahertz 91 at 4.6 and
86 for the 6700 K again these
differences here are pretty negligible I
would say for a game like this upgrading
the your CPU from skylake reven has well
to the new copy Lake CPUs really makes
no sense I want to answer this question
again with a broader scope taking all of
these benchmarks into consideration
including the synthetics and the video
rendering with Adobe Premiere Pro which
is important to someone like myself I
it's difficult to justify an upgrade if
you're already on skylake ok be like I'm
gonna be completely honest with you sky
and KB were already axel in gaming CPUs
especially got an i5 or an i7 that could
be overclocked and you were willing to
deal it especially for KB Lake you can
get some serious overclocks
and some serious performance jumps with
those overclocks in games I'm not sure
though that it's
worth upgrading from that to coffee lake
and here's why because you're not only
have to buy a new CPU but also a new
motherboard right so z 370 chipsets are
only going to be compatible with the
latest copy like CPUs you cannot throw a
coffee like CPU into a Z 270 board as of
right now I don't there's any BIOS that
I know of that you can flash on an older
motherboard to make it compatible there
there are different power requirements
different power delivery methods for
coffee like that make it incompatible so
older motherboards are not going to be
able to support it that said I don't
think that it's worth upgrading if you
have sky or KB that's my verdict there
if you are already in Rison stay with
Rison i think that risin 5 is still the
best of value cpu lineup currently we'll
look into the i-580 600k later on see
what that offers but this is where I'm
gonna this is where I'm gonna leave it
I'm gonna leave it here if you have
anything older than sky like let's say
has well especially Ivy if you're on Ivy
Bridge by this point just go ahead and
upgrade just move on a ddr4 get yourself
the new feature sets you'll be plenty
happy with it but I think it's a waste
if you have sky or KB to upgrade because
you have to buy a new motherboard along
with the new CPU that's easily 500 bucks
if you want the 8700 ok so this is where
I'm going to call it I'm going to give
you some cut clean and dry opinions
based on fact with the price of the new
motherboard and the CPU taken into
consideration I don't think an upgrade
to coffee like if you just want to look
at the 8700 K as your upgrade path is
justified if you're already on sky or kV
platforms as well and later or Haswell
and earlier I should say give it some
thought if you're on Ivy Bridge I think
this is now the time you need to upgrade
you get the six cores so that's plenty
for the future and you get that high
overclocking potential if you are on an
FX platform from AMD or earlier then yes
also consider this upgrade path look
this is the best gaming CPU on the
market ok it's gonna cost you a pretty
penny you have to get the new
motherboard ddr4 and and the CPU so it's
upwards of six $700 depending on what
you want feature wise but I think it's
gonna be worth it you'll see some huge
gains in games and also in the editing
space if you're on a rise in platform
not sure what you're doing here maybe
you're just scoping out the competition
I would be perfectly fine if I had a
rise in platform right now and I saw
these benchmarks for the first time look
you guys are after the value the bang
for the buck that's exactly what rising
offers and I still think that the risin
560 hundred CPU is the best value CPU
out there you get the six cores same
amount of cores as you get with 8700 K
for considerably less the motherboards
are also fairly cheap you get a B
through 15 motherboard and still
overclocked 3.9 gigahertz which is
pretty good for a rising CPU and you get
the ddr4 the new feature set so it's a
recent platform you're gonna get decent
gaming performance and you're gonna get
the the strong editing potential with
the high core counts in the risin line
up that's what we're gonna call it if
you liked this video be sure to give it
