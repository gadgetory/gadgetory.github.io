you might be thinking wow fifty bucks
for this case what a steal but as always
with all cases in this price category
there are a few compromises this is the
cooler master master box five light why
is it so cheap let's find out the first
thing I want to discuss what I thought
when I first pulled this case out of its
box I knew it was fifty bucks going into
this I had only seen a few pictures of
it to be honest I really wasn't sure
what to expect especially with this
price tag and I was actually pleasantly
surprised so it looks great I think that
it's actually one the best-looking $50
cases on the market but there are a few
things Coolermaster did to keep the
price down you'd only really notice if
you actually are hands-on with the case
so the first thing I noticed was that
the front panel here which appeared to
be tempered glass is actually only
acrylic and it's a pretty flimsy acrylic
at that so that's the first cost of you
measure there the thing is though they
make it look like a tempered glass panel
which I don't have a problem with if
you're going to pay 50 bucks make it
look as good as you possibly can for the
money so the websites not too specific
on the material that they use to make
the case this is the dark mirrors what
they call it it's a semi-transparent
front panel so you can see LED fans and
whatnot through the front panel just
very tinted keep that in mind in this it
feels like a plastic it's nothing
special
definitely not glass or anything of that
sort but again keep the price in mind
another cool thing about the front panel
though you can change the trim color
here on the top and the bottom so I have
white on right now but you can change it
to red and black and all three of those
colors are included in the box
now something I am very worried about
this case I have to be completely honest
here is airflow I get that vibe when I
look at the front panel the fact that
there is no place to mount fans anywhere
on the top of the case the you can mount
downs period and there's no ventilation
up top not even little just grooves for
air to pass through it's just a solid
piece of metal that's it that's coffee
hot so absolutely no air travel at all
in or out of the case on top
you only get one included fan as well
and it gets decently loud at around 50%
rpm it's also only a 3/10 fan so only
voltage control no PWM for that wider
range the front panel also reveals this
there's only a tiny slit up top for air
to pass through and seeing as though you
really can't put
take bends anywhere else in this build
it's going to have to be an intake port
up top also air can coming through the
bottom slightly wider gap down there but
this is going to be probably more
restrictive than the fantex p400s front
panel but at least that case has
ventilation up top you don't have that
at all here it's just the two tiny wheel
slips here and that's it you get an
exhaust fan in the back that's not good
enough
there are tiny little dust filters as
well but again you're only going to be
able to pull so much air through this so
the dust filters are kind of redundant
something else to kind of pick on here
cable management room in the back is not
all that great so this case kind of
follows a similar format that fractal
cases do but Franklin does it way better
so this has a slightly recessed front
panel good for moderate cable storage
room but back here we're talking maybe a
centimeter cable storage space so try to
keep as many your cables up front just
tie them off if you have just extras
kind of hanging around especially if
your power supply is not modular I would
say this is slightly better than the
Corsair 400 C for 60 X case in terms of
cable management not to pick on coarse
there that that case just a terrible
cable management I talked about that in
this video right here and then it's
probably slightly worse than an NZXT
s340 I think in C X these cases are
better and way they manage because they
have a nice groove and there's a bit
more room between this back panel and
the back of the case if this case had
maybe half an inch of extra room it
would be perfect you will find to
include hard drive trays in the bay
below they're actually quite nice their
tool lists you just unclip this at the
rear and it kind of expands it just a
tiny bit you can slide your HDD in and
then clip it back in place again
completely tool-less and then you just
slide it back into the tray no tool
necessary but there is a concern I have
with this well I don't expect many
custom loop builders to be interested in
the case of this cheap you have no space
for a pump because you cannot remove
this bay at all it's actually bolted to
the chassis even if you don't have hard
drives and just wants a space for extra
cable storage you can't do that either
because you can't do anything with this
just to take a drill and remove it which
you know not many people are going to
just drill through their brand-new case
it makes me wonder though if
Coolermaster did this is sort of like a
basement reinforcements so I wonder if
it was too flimsy before and they just
decided to bolt it here to make sure
that there was enough structural
integrity for the
basement itself I guess I was kind of
confused because there is a cutout here
in the basement for an extra long
radiator a 360 millimeter AIO would work
nicely in this case also three 120
millimeter fans or to 140 mils going
down so the cutouts nice for those
things but in terms of like custom loop
compatibility it's just there for looks
like it you really aren't going to be
able to do much with this smaller cutout
here the cutouts on top of the basement
are also a bit strange thing as though
it's really not custom friendly so I
guess ventilation with what they had in
mind here but I am a fan of the fact
that the basement stretches across the
entire case that is nice I wish all
cases in this price category did this
other course of the master box light 5
that I guess really can't call corks if
it's in this price category you only get
one SSD tray there is room for a second
one but they decided to leave that out
there is no cutout in the basement for
an HD audio cable so good luck routing
that thing and there are no rubber
grommet fries anywhere in this chassis
so just a bunch of holes but this case
does have many pros as well I'm a big
fan first off of the feet this case
stands very steadily on any table and
it's also listed decently off the ground
too
for adequate PSU air flow front IO is
also very populated we have a reset
switch headphone jack microphone jack
power button 2 USB 3.0 hubs and a hard
drive LED indicator I'm very surprised
by how sturdy the chassis is as well
there's almost no flex no bend anywhere
and the panels are extra thick just a
heads up though this case does not come
with any LED strip as some of the
pictures on their website would suggest
some of the pictures have an LED strip
resting atop a basement that is not
included with this case the only things
you get apart from what you need to
mount the gear you're going to throw
into the chassis are the three different
sets of trim to put on the front panel
oh and one other thing worth mentioning
this case totally rips off for actual
designs PSU mounting system and I guess
fact will kind of rip it off from NZXT
so you get this little power supply
mounting bracket and then two thumb
screws secure it in place
nonetheless it's nice to have let's
answer the question then is this case
worth 50 US dollars it really should be
answered in the context of a strict
budget if you're only going to spend 50
bucks on a case chances are you're only
going to spend around five six hundred
bucks on the internals of the PC usually
the case is around 10% of the entire
budget unless it's like a four thousand
dollar PC build
cases not bad for 50 bucks I'll tell you
that right off the bat if I only had to
spend 50 bucks on a case this is
probably the first one I would get look
there are plenty of cheap cases on
Newegg DIY PC makes plenty of cheap
cases they have a lot of compromises and
they don't look all that great to me at
least this one tries to pass off as a
nicer case and it is I mean come on an
acrylic side panel that looks like a
tempered glass side panel it's pretty
cool pretty cheesy at the same time but
it looks decent and apart from the fact
that this chassis doesn't have a cutout
for the HD audio cable you'll find that
this case is actually pretty easy to
build in now you're not going to have to
struggle with trying to get cables where
they should go you have two large
cutouts on the back panel two large
cutouts in the basement and a large
cutout in the front for plenty of fans
and a large radiator you just get the
feeling it's begging to be built in
there's plenty of space in there for
virtually anything you want and you can
even customize it to an extent for 50
bucks I say that's a killer bargain and
it's even trying to pass off its looks
as a more expensive case than it is
again I don't see anything wrong with
that 50 bucks a case is a good deal
