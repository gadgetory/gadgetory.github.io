to choose from the case Department aleem
the PCO 11 dynamic case that I really
loved the NZXT s340 elite the Kula
Master H 500 it's a crowded field
perhaps the case most similar to the
silent base 601 from be quiet that I'm
showing right here is the fractal design
to find r6
I won't actively compare it in this
review but I do want you to keep it in
the back of your mind because it's
another case that's very similarly price
actually similar in terms of its
dimensions but it offers a very
different set of features you can watch
this video right here for a refresher
both cases again take vastly different
approaches in both form and function and
with one big exception the silent base
601 actually nails it
the name suggests a silent profile and
it's literally in the name of the case
so much of my review will revolve around
this claim the 601 is an elongated mid
tower with seven PCI slots two vertical
slots for optional mounting and support
for an array of hard drives tore to the
front
this model is black and orange that you
can buy this in black and gray or black
with black trim so you'll find the
orange trim over the front intake in
this case of the grilles as well as the
rubber grommets I love seeing subtle
differences in color options and again
if you want a fan of orange you can buy
the gray or black trim models starting
with overall stance and support the 601
fits all the way up to e ATX
motherboards if you're willing to remove
these drive covers there is no intention
toward the front as with some other
cases for extra cable management
headroom but you aren't likely to miss
it anyway seeing as though the entire
right side of this case protrudes an
entire three or so centimeters actually
about an inch and maybe a quarter behind
the motherboard tray that means that
you'll have extra space back here for
remaining cables hard drives and
anything else you want to really fit
back on the right side so under almost
any circumstance I can imagine securing
the right panel is pretty easy speaking
of which how does that work so the sound
base 6:01 deploys a pair of trigger
release buttons toward the back that
unlatch both the right and left panels
in identical fashion this is a very
simple solution similar in design to the
NZXT h 700 right panel latch and it
works very well in this case and another
thing at least in my case no pun
intended
pushing the button doesn't mean that the
panel falls over and slams on to your
desk it's actually held firmly in place
until intentionally removed from the
grooves at the base of the chassis so no
one wanted destruction there so great
construction and implementation I
actually think that this might be
slightly over engineered although it is
beautifully constructed I'm not trying
to stereotype German design but it could
probably be a little simpler I'm not
gonna complain though because it works
really well as is but speaking of these
panels you can see how beefy they are
there's like little ventilation slits up
top although they don't look very
functional you can see the glass itself
is actually slightly tinted I'm happy
about it you'll actually be able to see
inside your case if you choose the
window version of the 601 which means
that your
gonna have to light it up with LEDs if
you really want to see through a dark
tint in any other case again no it's a
really thick panel it's not necessary
especially this stuff up top but it's
very sturdy and I mean that kind of fits
into the price tag right you're really
paying for quality and this reliable
construction here I really like the way
it looks the right panel has no glass
but instead sports super thick damping
mat at 10 millimeters it's actually one
of the thickest I've ever seen in a case
and extends to both the top and front of
the case as well if you opt for the non
windowed version you'll also have this
mat on the left side so this plays a
huge part in keeping things quiet inside
and when paired with the right mix of
hardware results in a super stealthy
profile overall hearing anything from
inside this case would be a major pain
because you'd have to really try hard to
hear anything I'm serious even with the
glass panel version that I have here
it's a very silent case even when things
are under full load I'm not talking
about this specific build here Oh visas
for water cooling but any bill that you
have in here even when you run fans at
full rpm which we'll talk about later
it's just it's an overall very silent
case and that's again what you're paying
for right silence in the name you expect
it to be silent and I was blown away by
just how suppressed everything was from
a noise standpoint in this case now an
important point to keep in mind though
about the non windowed version is that
it will be quieter with that extra mat
on the Left panel tempered glass is
pretty terrible in general it's sound
damping so if you're into buying silent
basic so one for it's a low audio
profile make sure you forgo the tempered
glass version the top of the case is
pretty bare saved this removable
radiator and fan bracket it doesn't
require any screws to remove which is
actually really nice and it spans the
entire top section of the case for a
full triple fan support though you may
want to shy away from using this all
together and we'll talk about why later
in the video so the back of the case is
pretty standard or removable PSU bracket
supports the rear PSU mounting that
we've seen on many cases to date though
this one is a very tight fit with
certain power supplies including the one
I have in here from enter max a large
dust filter spans the entire base of the
case by the way and can be removed from
the front if you're worried about
cleaning anything that your power supply
might pull through it vertical graphics
card mounting is supported like I said
earlier but it places the card right
against the glass so if you don't plan
water cooling I'd stay away from this
for now maybe include like a third party
a vertical kit that can be you know used
as a replacement for the horizontal
brackets but this thing back here is no
good for air cooled cards in my opinion
and I mean to be honest it's not like
you get a riser cable or bracket anyway
with the purchase of the case now I
really love the basement inclusion in
601 I'm glad that be quiet has actually
caught on to the basement craze it was
something that we saw in the dark base
700 and I really like the aesthetic what
they've done here by kind of indenting
the be quiet logo on the bottom it's
very subtle but you know it to be quiet
case when you see it not only because of
the orange accents but because again of
this logo which isn't gonna stand out
from a crowd but if you're really
looking forward trying to figure out who
designs the case then there you go it's
actually one of only two I think
locations where you'll find that the
name of the company manufacturing the
case is here on the side of the power
supply and up front now the basement is
slightly modular referring to the two
removable pieces toward the front one
provides access for a 360 mm meter
radiator or something similar that's a
change from the original silent base 600
of which this case is kind of like the I
guess younger brother and the other acts
as an optional fan mount for added
ventilation from below if you're really
into that sort of thing though I'm sure
you could probably turn this into a
makeshift pump res mount or something
like that with a few added little tweaks
to it with respect to custom water
cooling though there appears to be ample
room I'll actually be throwing a custom
move build into this case soon which is
why you're seeing all these custom live
gear in here - the tubing and the
reservoir and the pump so I'll be able
to speak more to that application in the
future but for now it looks like there's
ample room there's plenty of space
between the motherboard the edge of an
ATX motherboard and where the radiator
sits currently and that's where
originally all the hard drive trays
would go so you are foregoing that
aspect of the case when you choose to
throw a custom loop in here though I
mean most people I know aren't filling
their cases with tons of hard drives so
it's a nice addition for those who
really need it but the modularity this
case keeps it at bay if you aren't
interested in filling it with hard
drives you can turn this into a very
water cooling friendly case I'm almost
certain of it
just sing from the stuff that I've
thrown in here how easy it is to arrange
it all I was a little disappointed
though that the front radiator cut out
is about five millimeters too short for
a 60 mil thick rats if you get a really
beefy rat it's not gonna fit in this
case because that indention actually
narrows into that next removable panel
and that makes it too narrow for a
standard you know form-factor radiator
so you're only gonna fit up to maybe 40
mil thick rads in here 60s again are not
gonna fit just by a hair or two I wish
they would have made it just a little
larger and then putting a beefy right up
front would really that would have been
awesome I actually had one I wanted to
use couldn't use it because again that's
small difference between the size of the
cutout and the thickness of the rat now
I touched on this earlier but I want to
quickly dig into the right side of the
case with the three or so centimeters
you won't have trouble routing cables or
even using extensions tie points litter
the tray and be quite includes velcro
straps in the box to keep things nice
and clean you can mount up to two hard
drives by default or the front the
entire cage is removable and the orange
rubber vibration mounts are a welcomed
addition as the case is very long from
front to back you'll find more than
enough room for a really thick power
supply even with the large extended ones
you can find plenty of space for
remaining cables and extra things like
extensions or you know you can like tape
SSDs down here if you really want
case in point there's a lot of space at
the bottom because the case is so long
or depth-wise thick that's what's the
dimension I'm looking for anyway it's
longer than normal a removable SSD tray
sits behind the motherboard tray and
serves as an excellent use of otherwise
wasted space this is not new by any
means it's what we've seen quite a bit
from fractal design cases in the past
but I really like the inclusion I don't
mind copying at all on anything direct
design came up with the idea but it
works really well in this case because
otherwise you're gonna have to mount
SSDs into the hard drive trays below and
if you have two hard drives already
you're gonna have to add something up
top or tape it to somewhere else in the
case so having that extra little bracket
there behind the motherboard is actually
a really nice inclusion given all the
other support this case already has but
at this point I have to point out the
one
to compromise for this case if you can
already tell that's air flow so the
entire chassis is actually closed off
and that's part of the reason why it's
so quiet not only thanks to the sound
damping mats but also because it is
literally a shell that has very few
access points to the atmosphere I mean
the reason why I told you to avoid the
top fan rad bracket whatever you wanna
call it earlier is because the potential
for airflow either in or out of the case
up here is super limited so just looking
up into the case now you see the sound
damping pad it spans the entire top
section the whole ceiling if you will of
this case there are few tiny slits back
here at the rear these will work kind of
but only for the rear fan so if you
place let's say two fans one here and
one toward the front this one over here
is either gonna be pushing air into a
sound damping pad which does nothing
it's gonna make your system sound louder
and that's about it or it's gonna try to
pull air from a sound damping pad at
which point why do you even have the fan
there to begin with so I'd like this
I like the bracket itself but I think
that the design choice especially given
how restrictive airflow is with the top
section of this case it's just a little
confusing to me because this would've
worked great if they had like a mesh top
panel or something that had just a
little more breathing room but this is
entirely closed off again attributed to
the silent factor of the case but then
it hinders airflow and then if your
system gets a louder because components
are running hotter then it's not a
silent anymore and doesn't that defeat
the purpose the front panel is arguably
worse from this perspective the tiny
metal holes up front are already
restrictive enough but the air must then
turn get this 90 degrees inward and then
90 degrees back toward the cases rear at
which point passes through a dust filter
that's more resistance before hitting
the fan blades assuming you have a
couple fans up front this creates a
strong negative pressure zone between
the front panel and chassis as exhibited
here I tied a few thin strips of paper
to one of the included peer wings two
fans there are two by the way included
with this case and mapped airflow
patterns with the front panel off versus
on what you're seeing here is the fan
operating at max rpm with the panel on
this is what it looks like with the
front panel off I'll put it back and
forth a few times just so you can see
there's a huge difference here and it's
something to strongly consider when
buying this case and that's ultimately
where I struggle with the entire point
of this chassis like I think it looks
really good I love the silent aspect of
it but it's really limiting itself in
terms of who would buy this because for
overclocking enthusiasts or just people
who have you know hot components they
even r9 390 or 290 or to 90 X you know
that things are gonna run really hot
right so you want as optimal air flow as
possible you're not gonna get that from
the front you're not gonna get that from
the top you're not gonna get that from
the left side panel unless you turn this
thing to an intake at which point I mean
you and then I'm gonna question how
you're gonna get the air out of your
case this it's just so closed off in
here you're not gonna have a good time
with those you know toasty components so
overclockers definitely want to be weary
of this one so I guess this is supposed
to be silent and it certainly is but
only up to a certain point right where
temperatures inside heat up Hardware
past a certain point then those fan
cards need to be ramped up meaning the
entire build would effectively operate
louder as a result making this build not
silent anymore right so from an
overclocking enthusiast perspective in
my opinion this is a no-go plain and
simple the you know systems just gonna
get way too hot you're gonna be starved
for air and it's gonna run pretty loud
the top panel actually inhibits natural
radiation upward by the way because
there's minimal ventilation up top so
it's just I'm just questioning why they
didn't put some kind of mesh material up
here I know they wanted to keep it quiet
but it's really hard to go for a very
silent oriented chassis without
compromising on airflow capabilities
because in order to have you know
airflow maximized you have to have kind
of like a very thin membrane right
between the interior of the chassis and
the atmosphere that means that any
component inside your system running
pretty loud will be heard by people
around the case and then it's no longer
silent so they definitely are trade-offs
but at which you know at what point do
you end up sacrificing so much airflow
that your system becomes so much hotter
as a result
that it's just as loud as it would have
been before and that's what I'm
struggling with this case I'm not sure
yet I have to run more tests but for now
I can say for certain this front panel
is extremely restrictive when it comes
to air flow and that the top certainly
doesn't help anything by the way I did
include an extra sign that links three
fan with this build the two fans that
you get included with the case are pure
wings two fans and they're still pretty
good but these stay really silent so
that's why I threw one in here it's
gonna probably have to work overtime to
get whatever heat is in here out of the
system so that's why I threw back there
I move the two peer wings two fans up
front and that's what I recommend you do
as well you're gonna want to pull as
much air as you possibly can through
this restrictive front panel so my
conclusion for this case is this if
you're running a low profile setup don't
plan on overclocking maybe have
relatively quiet hardware maybe be quiet
or knock to a fans coolers and a large
graphics card with plenty of cooling
potential then you're fine your system
will run several degrees hotter
depending on your configuration over
that up like an airflow optimized case
but you'll still be able to keep the
noise level down under load at the
expense of slightly higher thermals now
if you're overclocking running an r9
290x let's say sticking with a two-two
chassis fan default setup whatever
overclock your cpu to five gigahertz the
thing is we get hot loud and at that
point I would question the viability of
buying a silent case to begin with
anyway so it really depends on who's in
the market for what I can certainly see
a use case for this case but it isn't
for everyone
we'll see how well a custom loop holds
up in it in the coming weeks if you guys
like this video thumbs up you know what
to do thumbs down for the opposite let
me know what you think about the case in
the comment section below and I'll catch
