while in an airport terminal the
assumption I'm going to make in this
video is that you've already seen the
plethora of benchmarks for the Intel
Core I 999 hundred K with its eight
cores and sixteen threads it's
definitely the new gaming king no
denying that but at what cost well on
paper over 500 USD actually closer to
600 right now that can easily jump to 7
or 800 USD equivalent in other countries
mind you where supplies and taxes vary
we'll assume though the u.s. figure for
the sake of argument here so who in his
or her right mind would spend $500 $600
on a hyper-threaded eight core CPU well
according to Intel the same kind of
people who would spend upwards of 400
USD on a hyper-threaded 6 core CPU the
8700 K was successful from the start
because it held the title of gaming King
and it's been that way for quite a while
it was praised as such by myself and
colleagues and this regard and to be
completely honest I don't really have
much of a problem with a vast majority
of Intel's pricing structure I had never
really complained too much about like
core i5 pricing I did complain quite a
bit about the 73 50k that was excessive
and I called it outright when I saw it
that most of the time Intel is pretty
smart about how they price things but
when it comes to the 900 K I'm a little
a little flustered a little upset
because I feel like that's not where the
market price for that chip should be but
it is and we'll explain why we'll
explain why they're sold out everywhere
and we'll also explain how that price in
the future will affect sales right now
for AMD counterparts because I'm sure
AMD a little worried but I don't imagine
they're too worried because the people
who are already buying AMD CPUs are more
value oriented and in tell us pretty
much forfeited that running at this
point so in a nutshell if you want a
core i3 you'll pay a little over a
hundred bucks for it
you want a Core i5 a little over 200 i7s
have traditionally been in the 3 to 350
sweet spot that's referring to the last
few generations but this latest launch
is a bit strange if you want Intel's
most expensive consumer grade ship now
you'll have to pay over 500 USD for
closer to 600 again if we use the 8700 K
as a bit of context its MSRP was roughly
350 at launch
jumping to 500 bucks for this generation
or higher which is arguably another
refresh you'll need to pay 40% more for
it and again for marginal improvements
across the board now at this point some
of you may be trying to defend
intelligent think wrong with defending a
company as long as it's justified
correctly in my opinion well its price
so much higher because this is the first
eight core consumer trip they've ever
released this is an exception and to
that I have to counter arguments one the
8700 K was Intel's first six core
consumer chip it didn't cost 500 or 600
USD and - why is it that AMD can charge
so much less for honestly even many
where between maybe a 10 to 15% FPS
delta which most people are willing to
concede when seen in the context of a
$600 chip versus a $300 one to be fair
we are seeing sometimes a 15 to 25
percent performance loss between the
9900 K &amp;amp; 2700 X that's currently AMD's
best consumer grade cpu but in many
games this gap narrows significantly and
that's why I said 10 to 15 prior to this
so why should this makes sense why
shouldn't we question Intel's pricing
strategy here many are upset and I
believe it's justified but I don't know
if we understand the full context here
and that's what I want to bring to light
in this video
it isn't even like these CPUs require
entirely new platforms right with simple
BIOS updates coffee lay configured
chipsets can't handle the new generation
with ease power limitations aside but I
am curious as to whether the power draw
from an overclocked 900 K under load can
be sustained without vrm throttling more
testing coming soon on the channel in
that arena so back to the whole pricing
strategy thing what exactly is behind
Intel suggested a retail price and why
our inventory level is always so low at
launch my theory is twofold the first is
that Intel's obviously using the 40
nanometer node for both its chipsets and
CPUs that short supply because you can't
push all of that productivity into the
CPU side of things I get it but I also
think that demand is always high in the
beginning and when you have a loyal fan
base that demand curve tends to be
inelastic meaning large changes in price
won't change quantity demanded so when a
conventional market when prices go up
demand decreases and resulting supply
increases this gap between the two lines
signifies a deadweight loss or to be
more exact in this case markets surplus
but in an inelastic scenario the demand
curve is much steeper so when we slide
up and down the y-axis representing
product price quantity demanded along
the x-axis remains relatively unchanged
brand loyalty tends to be the cause of
such events that
or the good in question is something
that's essential which may require state
and local regulation to control that's a
separate issue and tell in this context
however is not regulated it's my belief
that they're totally aware of their own
brands consumer base they know how many
are loyal they know how many are locked
into contracts and they know how many
programs are Blue Team dependent and
that's a true story there are many
programs that will favor Intel
Architecture over AMD architecture if
you test CPUs for a living or at any
point during your life I'm sure you'll
realize that to some extent so maybe
they play on these cues and push prices
to Heights AMD could only dream of in
its current state and that's the problem
I have with this you see I don't
necessarily blame the consumers for such
a high ninety nine hundred K price
despite their inelastic demand
tendencies I can't really blame until
either because they're doing what they
want them to do and and honestly they
could push more CPUs to the market I
think that they could I think I think
they would I should say and that's
because again if you sell more you
control more of the market that's been
their goal all along and if Intel
doesn't meet contracts at certain dates
then it loses of contracts to AMD AMD
gains more market share especially in
the server space which is where Intel's
desperately trying to keep its ground
and that's a big problem for the blue
team but it ultimately is good for the
consumer because it means that we have a
more even distribution of market share
which means that prices should
ultimately be more competitive that's
just again a theory on paper and we'll
have to see how that plays out in 2019
and 2020 so when I said on Twitter that
Intel should lower its prices in order
to properly compete we of course know
that's not gonna happen I just wish in a
perfect society that was where the
prices were because I feel like that is
ultimately where they should be
not because of a variety of
circumstances including the dual 40
nanometer node production also a fact
that Intel has Intel I can pretty much
charge whatever they want for something
and people will still buy it because
they're into loyal and you know that
Intel CPUs ultimately get the job done
the way they want them to and regardless
of whether or not Intel artificially
short supply which I think they would if
they could but can't in their current
state the fact of the matter is they can
charge whatever they feel like charging
again within reason in order to position
themselves financially above the red
team remember the the goal the end of
the day for companies of this size is to
benefit the shareholders and if you
maximize margins you're going
benefit the shareholders in the long run
for that matter I don't even blame AMD
for this I mean sure we went through an
extended hiatus after piledriver and the
FX lineup but we've had two solid years
for the market to saturate anyone who's
wanted to convert to AMD or upgrade at
this point probably already has or they
will when the next-gen stuff rolls out
which is what we always hear but I think
ultimately that whatever we have next
time around is going to be justified
enough by people who are on old hardware
that they'll want to upgrade if they can
so the point I'm trying to make here is
this AMD could have chosen to release
rice and chips at or slightly below
comparable Intel NSR piece but instead
they chose to undercut them completely
introducing an entirely new fan base
centered around the word value you can
buy eight core rise in CPUs for as low
as 180 bucks during solid online sales
that in my opinion destroys even Intel's
i5 offerings the traditional response
would be for Intel to lower its prices
too but they haven't instead they've
actually gone up but why because too
many systems are Intel dependent maybe
too many programs favor Intel
architecture and Intel chipsets too many
servers use Intel CPUs until owns too
much of the market share is that Intel
small no not at all
and you can't blame Intel for dominating
the market it's a free market for the
most part especially in the US and if
Intel does better they deserve to get
ahead in a society like this so who am i
really trying to blame here well it's
really no one's fault I mean the free
market allowed things to get where they
are today and I tend to lean on the side
of the invisible hand again with some
restrictions however what it entails
done here is give the middle finger to
those who insist on purchasing with a
value minded conscience that word values
almost always attributed at this point
with AMD and those are good reason why
so you want to buy our core I $9.99
hundred K it's the best gaming CPU on
the planet maybe not by as large a
margin as our pricing structure suggests
but if you want it you've got to pay a
premium I'll close with an opinion Intel
is becoming the apple of CPUs and I fear
it'll only get worse from here I must
AMD do some serious recon and grabs
additional market share though the free
market economists in me is begging for
more entrance wouldn't it be cool if we
could just choose between say like 10
different CPU brands desktop CPU brands
each with its own unique feature set
like choosing a car sadly we don't live
in that world but you gotta admit
that would be pretty dope you guys like
this video let me give someone a thumbs
up if you disagree with me or if you
