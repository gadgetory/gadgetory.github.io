sending us to Computex 2019 what's going
on everyone we are here at the deep cool
booth at Computex 2019 Nanjing
exhibition hall as usual we're gonna
start off with deep cool and they have
well something really interesting to
show you guys it's actually a live demo
explaining I guess graphically how some
of their latest tech works we're talking
specifically about the anti Li Tech we
got a video talking about I'll throw the
card up in a second but they're gonna
show you exactly how it works and why
it's necessary in AI so let's go check
it out
this is actually a real time pressure
analysis of the a iOS in question here
so coffee you want to zoom in show them
what's going on I'm gonna try to walk
you through this so that you can better
understand what the graphs are showing
you so there's a metal plate between
each of these CPU blocks right so that
middle plate there is basically a heat
plate and there's a temperature probe
between that heat plate and each of the
a IO blocks so when you look at the
graph in a second you'll see a red line
that's your temperature that's basically
what you know how hot those plates are
making the CPU blocks and then what
they're doing is they're heating up the
fluid inside each of these AI O's right
now without the fans on the pumps are
running so the fluid inside each is
circulating but the fans aren't
dissipating that heat actively now if
you pan up to the graph you guys can see
first off we've got the temperature
lines here in red on both sides this
sensor has been a little finicky so I
would take this one with a grain of salt
but this one's pretty accurate for the
most part you can see how that pressure
or that excuse me the temperature is
rising starting to level off a little
bit but again we don't have the fans
running so we expect this thing to keep
getting hotter with time these two lines
correspond to this y axis here and this
is pressure and kiloPascals and then
time here on the x-axis so how long
these tests have been running and then
up top you see our key a normal 240 a IO
they're actually using their own a IO
here without the anti leak tech without
that pressure relief valve we talked
about in one of our older videos I'll
throw that up in a card so you guys can
reference it if you are not sure what
we're talking about here that's what
you're seeing in the green line that's
an AI oh just a typical IO with no
pressure relief valve the yellow line
has the anti leak tech it has the
pressure relief valve basically a
bladder
that constricts and it constricts as the
pressure inside the AIO increases and
that happens normally when a fluid gets
hot any gas bubbles you have in there
will expand and so that's why you're
seeing this linear relation here excuse
me a linear relationship with pressure
and time right pressure increases as the
fluid gets hotter and you can see that's
what's happening here with a temperature
line the pressure relief valve is
actually doing what it's supposed to do
right now you can see the yellow line is
starting to level off they have pressure
probes inside each of these a iOS so
you're seeing real-time what the
pressure is like right now we're about
may about thirty kilo Pascal's and then
up here the one with no anti leak tech
it's around 40 or so kilopascal and we
expect that to increase you can see with
the 360 a IO is that Delta is even
higher and it's a bigger system right
and if we assume that the bladders in
each are the same size then that blood
is going to be more constricted by more
expansion in the 360 mil ail there's a
lot of really cool stuff going on here
again this is you know ya don't expect
these numbers to be real-world because
we don't have the fans on they just want
to show you what happens with a iOS in
general when they heat up fans aren't
gonna you know they're not gonna get rid
of all the heat immediately that's why
radiators are there because water has
really high heat capacity it's gonna
take a while for that heat to dissipate
and the fans do definitely help that
process but I think this is really cool
to see real-time the disparities between
the two anti leak tech no anti Lake tech
and again if you haven't watched the
original video about how that stuff
works the technology behind it the
constriction of the bladder then I
invite you to watch that before you see
this because you really have to see that
video understand what's going on
internally for this to make any sense
okay now what you're seeing are all a
iOS with their fans on and if you pan up
to the graph here car you can see
pressures dropping
and that is a response to the
temperature falling again this
temperature sensor is doing something
really weird ignore that one that you
see temperature is dropping in our 240
systems and concurrently pressures are
dropping they're actually gonna
eventually meet and that's you know
obviously when they're room temperature
around there they are the differences in
pressure are going to shrink really cool
again to see this real-time see that
temperature falling and right now we're
at about 60 maybe a little under 60
degrees
Celsius and the temperature at its peak
was about 65 maybe somewhere in at 62
and a half so I am really cool I don't
know what on earth the things but
there's a lot of stuff at play here like
I'm impressed that deeply even bothered
to set something like this up most of
the time when you come to these events
you just see companies showing off
products and you know telling you all
these really cool fancy things about
their products but you have to kind of
take their word for it and wait until we
test at least in this closed system from
what I've seen so far you can see that
the anti leak tech is actually doing its
job and that was something I really
couldn't show you in my original video
discussing the technology so deep pools
done us the honors and you're seeing
this stuff work in real time very very
cool and you can see here the 240 and
360 Castle a iOS just kind of in there
and natural states looking mighty fine
the differences this is the exact same
AIO we've built with in the past you've
seen it on the channel but it does come
now with the anti leaked text so it's
going to become standard in all Depot
iOS moving forward which is really nice
we have a v2 over here and the v2 s have
the extra ring on the side performance
fans we'll talk about all that when we
actually do reviews in the future and
then we also have small changes to the
proline so we have the original Pro
which was the first AIO from people to
implement the anti lake tech we also
have the they're calling it the it's
called the X now I don't know that some
of these naming they have e^x then we
have the pro then we have the X and
that's what this one is
and I think of it like extreme it's got
better fans served for a higher CFM and
then also stainless steel for the little
loop that was originally glass and this
was another failure point the deep cool
address so that's why it's stainless
steel now so you don't expect glass to
you know glass will break easier than
this stuff so for durability again with
the anti Wake Tech this is going to be a
really impressive AIO
and we have the 360 mils over there so
you guys have been awesome this is our
first official video I'm not sure if I'm
an air this video first I know ambe's
got some really cool stuff they just
announced we're gonna see a lot of it
this week so stay tuned for that but
always like stopping by deep holes but
we appreciate them for sponsoring this
video giving you guys a chance to
understand how the anti leak tech works
and
hopefully we'll see it in action again
in future AOS soon you guys have been
awesome this is Computex 419 coverage
thanks for watching and we'll catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
