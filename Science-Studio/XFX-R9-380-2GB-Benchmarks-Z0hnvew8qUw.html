r9 380 review we've overclocked this GPU
to eleven hundred megahertz at the core
and it's 1600 megahertz when the memory
we wanted to see how this performed
under very memory intensive games so the
one in particular that we focused on in
this benchmarking video was GTA 5 this
is indeed a very graphics intensive game
but we also wanted to see how the two
gigabytes of vram held up under the hood
so you can see we started the resolution
at 1080p
we have msaa on x two textures are
pretty high
shadows are pretty high grasses on ultra
waters very high we turn FX at a on as
well and our motion blur is set to
medium so the settings for this game are
set to fairly high parameters get it
high where you know in the in the air
and a play okay anyway so what you're
really worried about I assume is the FPS
and in this case we pull like a
staggering fifty two point two FPS on
the benchmark that's the benchmark that
you can access in the GTA game itself
and that's the one that we used we
should also mention that we have
equipped with the graphics card a FX
6300 overclocked to 4.2 gigahertz paired
with an ACS m5 a 97 revised 2.0 ATX
motherboard this combination proved to
be a formidable force especially in its
price range this build only cost us just
under $600 so you're getting quite a bit
of bang for your buck in this case so we
wanted to show you a comparison that
gamers nexus net performed earlier with
a stock until 4790k
they tested shadow of mordor at 1080p
and they maxed out the settings and
basically they just swapped graphics
cards with the setup that they had and
obviously the GTX Titan X blew
everything away what I wanted to do was
compare the r9 380 to the one above it
was GTX 970 as well as the one below it
the r9 280x perhaps its closest
competitor
in terms of price point and performance
one other thing that seems to be
important to a lot of people or are the
temps so I compared the temps of an r9
380 to the GTX 960 we wanted to to show
you that there really isn't much of a
difference between the r9 380 and a gtx
960 in terms of temperatures under load
and idle so this is the same benchmark I
recorded this with my phone actually
because I wanted to show you you know
we're not no this is making this stuff
up as we go this is at 1600 by 1200
resolution which is picks a little wise
it's just slightly under 1080p this is a
four by three aspect ratio versus
sixteen by nine so I think there's just
over a million pixels in ATP and there's
just under a million pixels in 1200 by
1600 so the FPS here will be slightly
higher than you get at 1080p but you can
see here that they're pretty consistent
one thing I did notice is that the card
tends to perform slightly under its
rated value at night I don't know why
but when I get too dark in the game fps
tends to draw maybe has to do with
shadows maybe the fact that NSA a is on
I'm not sure but that's something worth
noting as well
in terms of the vram I haven't noticed
any buffering stuttering there are a few
odd glitches that I noticed like see
that see that tire kind of twitching
back and forth I don't know why does
that it might be a software thing with
again it might be the graphics part I'm
not sure but GTA has like a ram limiter
you know it'll let you know if you're
passing your recommended use of ram
based on your card rating you can ignore
that it's not I mean unless you put like
four gigs worth of RAM data allocation
in there you know you're probably not
gonna notice much of a drawback in that
sense so going with a two gigabyte card
versus the four gigabyte card and for
this game in particular shouldn't hurt
you
so one other thing we wanted to do we
didn't just want to focus on the video
card we also wanted to show you some cpu
benchmarks the one we focused on
particular was the Geekbench 3 CPU
benchmark we just used the 32-bit three
tests and we ran our CPU at stock
through the tests and we got some pretty
pretty solid pretty consistent results
we looked at the averages for our CPU
and it came out about right so our
single core score was nineteen ninety
and a multi-core score was that we
caught 42 not bad but we kept this
another Xterra I'm sorry we kept the
stats consistent and we overclocked and
we got 21:52 for our single core score
in 89 17 for multi-culture this was with
an overclocked a four point two
gigahertz giving us an increase of about
18 percent comes of performance at least
for each bench in general so if you
haven't yet watched our building of this
computer that we're benchmarking right
now go ahead click on one of the two
links at the top left will take you to
the beginning of the video and top right
will take you straight to the building
phase of the big different one skip all
the other stuff and just go straight
into the construction of it but anyway
we appreciate your interest and thanks
for watching the video this is science
studio thanks for learning with this
