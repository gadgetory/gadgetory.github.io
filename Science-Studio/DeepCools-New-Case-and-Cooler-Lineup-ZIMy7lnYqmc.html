sending us to Computex 2017 we are back
at it again at the deep cool booth here
for Computex 2017 the first thing I'm
showing in this video this beautiful CPU
cooler called the gammak GT with RGB
integration all the way around the top
they actually have a front plate that
covers the metallic fin so you don't see
this ugly fins and also an RGB fan RGB
is the thing nowadays deep pool is
definitely jumping on board with this
right here and as always if you're
wondering what this particular unit
looks like in a PC build here you go the
lovely front plate with that cool design
up front you can see the RGB is wrapping
all the way around the top of the cooler
as well as through the cutouts on that
front plate you also have the RGB fan to
the right they don't look at in any case
because it is of course RGB now a very
cool case that caught my eye here the
deep cool booth the baron case liquid
now this is a slightly confusing case
only because it technically supports up
to ATX motherboards but only if you're
willing to put your power supply up here
now the one thing I was concerned about
when I first saw this case with fan
support because it's technically a micro
ATX case even though it does have full
ATX motherboard support so when I took a
peek up front I found support for two
120 millimeter fans as well as a single
140 millimeter fan even with the power
supply thrown into the front of the case
that's good news now it's called the
baron case liquid because it has an
integrated liquid cooler just like the
deep cool genome cases that ever viewed
earlier so it has a 120 millimeter
radiator up top the typical gamer storm
CPU block do you find that also in the
genome and then up front on the other
side of the radiator the loop continues
down to this flow meter which i think is
super cool also integrated with RGB LED
and the last thing worth mentioning here
at the deep pool booth the new arc 90
case this is a very premium case they
stress that in forehand it's not going
to be cheap but look how much space you
have I can picture a beautiful custom
loop inside this it's nice that they
have it out for show but you can't buy
it till October of this year I don't
have any intricate like super emotional
last farewell words for Computex 2017
but it is worth noting this is our first
very big event and I'm glad I was able
to bring a theme with him let Jacob and
will we're both able to be here
I am also appreciative of all the
companies who support us and got us to
this point and we have a lot of high
hopes for the future of this panel
thanks a large part to you and the
companies that we work with I'm
especially thankful to be school I
actually a huge fan of this stuff I know
that I say that a lot but I mean it I
really do appreciate a lot of their
products and it's been nice to have them
on board as a major sponsor with that
we're signing out we've got a long
flight back home we may have put a few
extra Computex videos after the fact but
we'll see how that goes this is science
studio thanks for learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
