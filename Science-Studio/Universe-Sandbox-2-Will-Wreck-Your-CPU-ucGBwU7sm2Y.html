you saw the title of this game will
absolutely unknown or CPU does no matter
what CPU have you can always push this
game to your CPUs limit so I encourage
you to check this game out at least it
lead to rent the thing or you know buy
it for what 24 hours or so I don't know
steam still doing that where you can
just test a game out and if you really
like you can keep it if you don't like
it you can get your money back but I do
encourage you to check this game out
this isn't something that they're
sponsoring or anything like that this is
just me wanting to show you a very cool
game that I find very interesting you
know we've talked about astronomy on the
channel several times in this game is
just right up my alley I love it you can
pretty much manipulate anything you want
in the solar system and that's what's
super cool about it I mean it sounds
kind of dumb on paper but if you think
about it okay so we got we have earth
here let's not even two or three that's
just too generic
so you double-click on Jupiter we can
zoom in now this is one of the cool
features of this game here game whatever
you want to call it simulator you can
control the speed the rate at which time
progresses and that's via this toolbar
down here at the bottom so let's say I
want time to just absolutely fly by so I
can speed it up to where were what are
we at right now we're at four months per
every second of real time so right now
you're looking at this as four months
every second so of course the planets
rotating very fast and we can actually
see it progress around the Sun you can
see everything else it's closer to the
Sun is moving much faster because that's
how physics works but let's focus on
Jupiter for a second here so one of the
ways that we can really stress the CEP
let's go ahead and go to the add tab
that we can add I mean all this stuff
here that's preloaded we can add any of
this into the solar system including
stars by the way if you're interested in
something some kind of binary system
like the Tatooine planet in star wars
but let's try to get the Earth orbiting
around Jupiter I don't know how far
we're going to want this thing to start
but I assume that at some point the
earth will just steadily rotate around
Jupiter and you can see there are little
paths that that kind of project from the
planet that we're about to spawn and
they kind of spin out so that's the
computer the simulator actually
predicting the planets path based on
gravitational influences this is where
ties into this game being very accurate
so let's say I throw the planet let's do
it fairly close you actually see the
shadow of the earth on Jupiter as well
it's very cool let's do it right here
okay so there goes it's just spinning
off in the distance
of course Earth is drastically cooling
because it's so much further from the
Sun than it normally is so surface
temperatures see that one degrees
Celsius now here here's what's also very
cool so we can click on the Earth and
you'll see if it as our surface
temperature declines the actual features
of the planet will also change okay so
there you go now you can kind of see
it's just more looks more hazy I guess
but this is the earth frozen over and
it's very cold right now average surface
temperature is negative 37 degrees
Celsius
Jupiter is still very hot for reasons I
cannot explain I guess when it got too
close to it just warmed up somehow and I
can explain that but we do have the
earth in orbit around Jupiter that was
our goal in the first place and what
we're going to do is speed up this
simulation I want you to pay attention
to the CPU usage I have right here I
know it says RAM usage below that but
this is CPU usage that you're looking at
so right now overall CP usage is around
40 40 % or so and that's just us
focusing on these two bodies right here
we're not even looking at the entire
solar system all the other planets and
stuff are back there this also has
asteroids included in it comets all
kinds of stuff even a dwarf planets like
Ceres and Pluto way out in the distance
so I want you to watch the view usage as
I do this I'm coming down to the bottom
here and I'm going to increase the rate
at which time progresses okay so now
we're at a couple days per second there
we go oh there it goes
so we're at a few months per second now
CPU usage has increased from 40 percent
to almost 70 percent and I don't know if
you notice this but if we include all
the other bodies in the frame that we're
currently having rendered then you can
see that the CPU surgery will actually
increase even more so let's just focus
on Jupiter we'll look down
that actually increased safety users for
a second there but our CP usage declines
because now the only thing the CP is
having to do is calculate Earth's
position with respect to Jupiter's with
respect to the Suns it's not really
worried about rendering the other stuff
even though the CPU is worried about
physics in general where things are
going to be in the next frame or two
let's slow things back down and of
course CPU usage dramatically declines
so that's one way that you can heavily
stress your CPU in this game it's just
by speeding up time that is something
that I mean makes sense you're having
your CPU work much faster and your GPU
mind you but this game is much more CPU
intensive than you than you might think
so let's take a and let's do something
crazy let's double click or sorry right
click on it and alright so we can change
all of these characteristics over here
we can change the the velocity of its
orbit we can change its rotational
velocity all kinds of different things
right let's change the service
temperature first let's raise it to 500
degrees Celsius and boom there goes all
the water you see it's just dissolving
that's actually really cool oh there
goes the oceans now the one thing that
is really going to influence how the
other plants react and how the Sun
reacts to the earth that's really cool
there is all the water vapor we're going
to increase the Earth's mass by a metric
crap-ton so let's say instead of one
earth mass for one earth mass which is
what it actually is in real life let's
raise it to 500 Earth's I've got a lot
bigger so with respect to Jupiter now
it's saying that we're one point five
seven times the mass of Jupiter let's
say let's keep going let's do five
hundred Jupiter's Oh earth got super big
what is that it's like a star now you
can see here we're speeding things up
and the planets are being heavily
influenced now by the earth which is
Mars is just going crazy so the earth is
swinging around now this is this is what
I'm getting at you'll see this here
shortly what we're going to do is
increase the mass of the earth again to
let's say fifty thousand I'm going to
pay attention to what happens to the
earth when we do this
I'm going to slow it up and so fifty
thousand suns okay we just we just
created a star essentially that's pretty
crazy so this star has a ton of mass
look at that look at our CPU usage whoa
whoa whoa
okay supernova remnant that is a black
hole we just created a supernova in our
solar system well there goes the old old
earth or whatever was left of it okay I
fix it so now you can just leave CPU
usage on top you see when the supernova
occurred we were at almost one mole we
were at 100% CPU usage so at that point
we just maxed out our CPU it just
couldn't it couldn't calculate anything
more than what it was already doing we
basically topped it off and that's kind
of the I mean that's the gist of this
video you can do so much with this and I
haven't even I mean I haven't gone to
great lengths to make this CPU just
absolutely crap itself but you certainly
could do that let's just end with that
so let's take let's take a star
let's take BG check out how hard to be
able to use this compared to everything
else in the solar system that is super
cool so if we simply speed up the
simulation CPU usage definitely
increases we have that variable under
control and look how fast we can make
this thing work like we can keep picking
it up that 80% overall CPU usage there
and it's fairly stable too and if we
increase it even more how many years
agreed this is 23 years per second being
calculated we had a hundred and thirty
seven years actually inducing some lag
at this point yep it's definitely
definitely not liking it but another way
I like to personally overload my CPU
with respect to this game is to open up
a very special simulation I like to do
Saturn with the Rings
this is just a chaotic nightmare look at
everything
orbiting just Saturn and this is you
know this isn't our solar system this is
just one
one planetary system how much stuff we
have there so we can get really fancy
with this so everything's you know nice
and tidy it looks all great right now
orbits are very controlled and stable
we're going to really mess this thing up
let's just throw an earth somewhere into
the mix let's do it right there let's do
another one and another one that sounds
good
maybe another let's just you know what
it's just the roam all over the place
that sounds good to me and we're going
to watch these earth which aren't even
rotating on the same axis the same
actual plane that all the other things
are on Saturn but we had one collision
there it is
zoom in on it what's the temperature of
Earth right now
well 2,400 degrees Celsius that's pretty
hot okay wait a lot of collisions Saturn
is also heated up to 2,700 degrees
Celsius so we're going to focus on
Saturn here for a second and then while
all this mess happens we're going to
also speed up time there it goes now
this is actually very smooth here we're
not seeing any frames stuttering any
skipping any stall that it actually
looks great but the CPU is being heavily
leveraged right now in the upper 70s we
increase the speed even more look at
that 90 percent and it's not the
smoothness at this point CPU is
definitely being used more than I'm
comfortable with I don't know let's
throw in a star let's do the Sun let's
just pretend the Sun is I don't know
right there okay and let's watch as
everything just just gets pulled right
in there it all goes see the simulation
maps out every possible scenario and
predicts where things will be at any
particular second especially way into
the future which is why the CPU is being
so heavily leveraged whoa that is a
super cool supernova I had this game
linked in the video description by the
way if you're interested in pushing your
CPU to its limit this is the game to do
that with if you like this video be sure
to give it a thumbs up thumbs down for
the opposite quickly subscribe but if
you haven't already and I will catch you
in the next video this is tells our
studio thanks for destroying with us
