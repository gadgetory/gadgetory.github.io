ITX PCG remember this one this is the
i-5 6400 with the GTX 1060 right that's
a 62 white video card yep so this is it
this is the fractal no - OH - you check
out the video right here if you haven't
seen it already but I promise you all
that we'd be upgrading the stock Intel
cooler that's currently still in here
with the cryo rig c7 which is a low
profile ITX cooler from cryo rig and
we're gonna go ahead and show you the
installation so how easy it is how may
be complex it is install I doubt it's
that complicated and then we're also
going to show you the advantages to
having an aftermarket cooler especially
in a small case like this where airflow
is well rather restricted so I gotta
find I don't know where I put here this
this one
there it is big old c7 on the side this
is it that's sure pretty heavy right
it's pretty good that's pretty good it's
gonna be good yeah every get some out
Rinka some Beauty shots of this real
quick so you guys can look at this and
list some cool music or sitting
everything else up so here we go roll
roll the tech porn
you
you
okay Zach so I told people that we were
going to show them how simple or complex
it was going to be to install this so in
order to fully gauge how easy the
installation process is you're gonna be
installing it awesome you sure you get
you ready for this you know okay fried
this thing tray ready for fry this thing
I'm pretty sure we're gonna have to pull
out the motherboard from the from the
actual case so we're gonna have to
unplug pretty much everything connected
to the motherboard which is everything
else in the case consequently so uh yeah
go ahead get to it get to it oh cool oh
yeah Mamma Mia
alright good luck with that one no one's
gonna be tough mine's a player Ram out
to get to it but we're gonna have to
reinstall the IO again remember how
difficult that was last time should just
be able to pull one side up all the way
and then you can just yeah so we set
there somewhere nice nice of those
things right there that one and then the
i/o pretty much any other two things you
need oh and your HD audio up front man I
can open this you get you get seven
problems it's the HD audio cable how
difficult can it be
I'm the good Jim the good thing about
soft into a cooler it's very easy to I
guess apply and then pull off later on
you need to upgrade okay good she is
your eye five sixty four hundred now for
the sake of consistency normally I would
recommend putting on new thermal paste
it looks like you've got enough on there
we'll probably scrape while there's not
much on here we'll put a little more of
the c7 stuff the cp7 stuff on there just
a tiny little bit tiny little bit that's
good that's all we need
huh come on Zach oh you should have
heard Zack was just making fun of all of
you who very very meticulously pointed
out the fact that we forgot to screw the
the support bracket the riser card into
the frame okay so you got everything
disconnected for them
unscrew those four screws and go ahead
and pull that out nope
did you follow it you guess that's a no
wait wait goes now you said it went
under there oh dear laughs like you
should be okay
there's nothing she'd hear dat front is
just kind of guide it through and there
she comes
slowly but surely SEC seven issues yeah
found some serious issues
nope if anything this just this just
shows you how tightly packed everything
is in the note - OH - I mean it's a
great case it's just very very crammed
it makes use of every inch of space it
offers I call it done yes we can use
this box as our little motherboard bench
for now I'll work this we need d5 this
one I think this is the yeah these are
directions okay so you're gonna be using
these four holes over here in the
corners so you have both AMD and Intel
support in one bracket so that's nice
and not too many pieces to have to
fumble with is that it seriously oh we
might look it over I understand this you
not a bug okay well let's try this one
that oh yeah here it is it's in this one
installation manual are you now that's
what I'm talking about yeah you have an
LGA 1150 X people can't see that now
they can okay so you're gonna start with
this one right here so you've got your
you've got your waiting are you okay
are you good buying a whole both and
flip the motherboard over no never never
do it like that go over your cross
pattern start over here first it's going
to be poking away up and yeah and have a
secure knot now the key here is not to
over tighten
so you want to tighten it just and after
we start feeling some serious stress
don't tighten it too tight this is a
plastic backplate so you know worst case
end up snapping the thing where those
are the two bolts it is nice that crying
always seems to include these tools for
installation these are good I mean this
is for a specific both sides but and you
could really just save this and use it
for anything else and okay and Zac there
you go that looks pretty cool doesn't it
yeah that's about it yeah that's it all
right so everything you've just undid
you have to redo basically got the four
pin now that's going to be plugged into
and pretty sure it's the white one I
think that was when we played into last
time should be cp1 maybe some wall this
one I have a tie strap a little we can
him like how I've tie it somewhere worst
case we can just leave it but no
actually fits perfect yeah okay good
alright so a ramp only room that that I
the way if you ever need to find your
motherboard specific manual and you just
didn't save the box for whatever reason
then you can hop on over to your
motherboards manufacturer website click
on something like believe this one's
going to be downloads so manual click
that and we want English of course hey
can you read traditional Chinese okay
never mind power LED positive starts at
two and then the power switch positive
starts at six
you got front panel connected good you
got a and you connected everything all
right there any say that yeah that's
fine
anything else that you can think of that
you may not have plugged in that looks
good to me I can't see anything loose
this is
we're supposed to be mmm the white one
don't that's right let me get my trusty
utility box so we can properly secure
yeah that folks already have it out this
is the megalith of computer screws right
here Wow so everything you could
possibly need
pretty much every size threat for
regular ol computer um try I don't know
if this is gonna be long yeah this
should be okay try that okay so it looks
like we're good to go is that go ahead
and make sure all these cables were
tucked in I was going to be a tight fit
again oh and don't worry about these we
didn't put those in because there's
specific type of screws required and I
don't have that here he has it in that
box that he took home with him so he'll
take care of that later
look at there now rotate that puppy oh
look at that you can see the fan through
and that look nice it'll look nice now
apart from that blower style cool which
you have in there I don't blame you for
having that's a good choice for an ITX
PC everything should be a lot quieter
now especially under load so that's
something that I'm interested in we'll
test that out and then we'll also test
out your thermals and then we'll be able
to just form our conclusions I mean
based on what I know so far that c7 is
gonna really bring down your temps so
yeah okay so we started we're just using
the trial version of i-64 here and our
idle temperatures were about 2021 see
basically the room temperature you're
not going to get CPU core temps below
room temperature if using an air cooler
you'd only get that in the case of
something like a phase change cooler
okay so it's been going for about it's a
little over eight minutes but I think
our tents are pretty much at their maxes
at this point so 46 degrees across two
of the cores and it looks like 40 around
41 and then 38 for the three and four
cores there so 46 47 so we're just going
to call it it's at 47 I'll just called
47 so that's our max core temperature
now and as you'll see here's the graph
of the previous temperature we were at
67 degrees Celsius using the stock Intel
cooler so we literally experienced a 20
degree Celsius dip in core temperatures
just by installing the cryo xe7 which
you can pick up right now for a very
modest price the link to that product is
in the description so with that said I
mean that's pretty much that's pretty
much all I wanted to show
temperature-wise and that's pretty much
black and white
so while primary 5 is still running you
see we're coming up on 10 minutes right
now the cooler still on and it's running
right now I don't know what the fan
speed is currently but this is what you
would expect it to run it around full
load if you don't tweak with the fan
curve at all and I'm going to put the
camera right so my face right now is
about it's about a foot away from the
camera from the camera's microphone I'm
do the same exact thing for the for the
cooler here so you get an idea of how
loud it is under full load so I'm the
same distance away from the camera right
now that the CPU fan is and I can tell
you just straight up right now is a huge
difference in terms of how loud the
cooler is under load Zach you can attest
of that too right so you have this
computer for well a few weeks with the
Intel the end of stock Intel fan and now
that you've got that thing in here it
this is what it would sound like while
playing a game something similar to this
maybe a little quieter what do you think
about the difference so much Quarry is a
lot quieter huh so if I told you this
was about 30 bucks would you invest in
one of these $30.00 so you think it's
worth extra healthy CPU core
temperatures and on top of that more
enjoyable gameplay and just you know if
you just want to watch movies or
something and you got something else
going on the background if your fan ever
did pick up and speed it wouldn't sound
very bad would it super quiet yeah it's
a lot better so that's it folks oh
there's your temperatures we went up to
48 so I'm going to adjust that in the in
the graph at 48 see and very very modest
sounds coming from your from your
computer now so even if you don't worry
about that loud spooling sounder you
don't know
it's exactly what it sounds like with a
stock cooler so alright folks I'm gonna
go ahead and let Zach end the video go
ahead and say that the usual Zach thank
you guys
is it all you're gonna say yeah I'm
