worry about today folks actually it's an
Amazon Prime days because it lasts 48
hours and right now we're right in the
middle of it and they do have plenty of
stuff at least discounts in the PC tech
space so I'm gonna show you some of my
top picks what's in my cart and what I
will actually personally be buying I can
get a lot of this stuff for free if I
just wait patiently from companies but I
it's just easier sometimes to buy it
yourself and some of these deals are
really good so they might not even have
enough inventory for review samples and
builds and whatnot so I'd rather buy it
myself
anyway plus you get two days shipping so
some of these deals are gonna be prime
exclusive if you have Amazon Prime then
you're in the clear if you don't have
some prime consider signing up and if
you do so via my link it gives me a
small bounty discount actually a little
kickback of like it's like a dollar or
two dollars something like that but it's
pretty small but anyway it helps me out
and you can find most of the stuff I'm
going to show you in this video link
down below if you are interested most of
the stuff I do have hands-on experience
with or at least second hand experience
with so I'm not gonna recommend a
product I think is crap and if the
reviews on Amazon are over all decent
and I will feel comfortable showing it
here let's dive in
if you're rockin the Windows 10
operating system and haven't activated
your copy click the link below and
purchase an OEM license from s CD key
then click here here here and then here
paste your activation key and you'll
have a fully activated OS in seconds and
be sure to use my offer code as studio
for an 18 percent discount on your order
so what I've got here is my card and so
far 11 things like it's not a ton but
like you don't want to go spending your
entire like paycheck on on stuff for
prime day so this is pretty much what I
have again you can find this stuff
linked down below
and we're gonna start here at the bottom
and kind of work our way up so here we
go this is a sapphire rx 574 gig now
it's not yeah it's not gonna crush games
in 1440p but it is a nice intro card
we'll handle 1080p with ease and look
it's it's an AIB it's gonna run pretty
cool
in my experience sapphire cards are just
fine you can see for 24 reviews four
stars out of five and a hundred and
twenty bucks how can you go wrong with a
hundred and twenty dollar card right
this and they're really cheap and
they're they're cheap in part because
the architecture is older now right
we're on navi but we only have a couple
variants to worry about and AI beasts
are slowly starting to push out their
variants of those cards so 120 bucks is
a really nice intro graphics cards gonna
be much better than a 1050 TI or a GT
1030 or even something old-school like
an AR 9 you know to a DX or something
like that so if you're right if you're
considering a budget build and you want
a game in 1080p for sure
even some newer titles or titles that
are pretty intensive maybe like GTA 5
even Witcher 3 could get by with maybe
medium settings and 1080p maybe a little
higher than that then this card will
serve you just fine so 120 for that one
I think it's a good buy next up we've
got a Corsair Vengeance ddr4 by the way
none of these companies have paid me
anything to show you what I'm showing
you this is just the stuff that I found
I'm sure you'll see a lot of the same
stuff recycled on other channels and
other videos pertaining to prime day but
this one caught my eye because it's only
69 bucks and check this out well this
one's only 2666 I believe we can get the
black models
we have 3000 years yeah look at that
3000 megahertz cache latency 15 at $70
so if you want maybe the white ones a
little slower speed maybe have an Intel
build in mind and that frequencies not
really gonna matter as much for horizon
though I'd obviously recommend the
tighter timings higher frequency and
3000 megahertz is pretty fast for a dual
eight gig kits as 16 gigs in total at 70
bucks these are almost pre inflation or
pre price fixed memory price that's from
like 20 what 2015 2016 so I'd say this
is a really good deal if you've been
waiting to buy Ram this kit is really
nice I have this exact kit by the way
next we got a Samsung SSD this is the a
60 QBO one terabyte model for 100 bucks
good old 4-bit mlc is working for you
now it's just gonna be a more reliable
drive over all you're gonna get reads
and writes for around 500 megabytes per
second she's your typical to happen to
say to drive using the SATA interface of
course so not envy me speeds but for a
hundred bucks I say this is pretty good
price per gig territory we're in and if
you're the ballpark for a hard drive so
you gets got a 2 terabyte Barracuda for
49 bucks you can see it's typically
around $55 what will happen is you'll
pay around 40 to 50 bucks for one
terabyte and you get that second
terabyte super cheap at a pretty big
discount and check this out 7200 rpm so
I'm on the fastest for hard drive reads
and writes anyway some people will swear
by WD some will swear by C gates almost
swear by Toshiba doesn't matter they're
all hard drives for the most part you
see excellent ratings here and if you
have a huge Steam library like I do for
testing and things of that sort and you
transfer this thing from build to build
it's very simple to set up in your steam
account you just designate that as your
main drive for your library and things
will load fairly fast so it's a great
way to transfer all of your games very
fast without having to redownload them
all which really sucks especially when
you internet connection is not the
fastest next up we've got a crucial p1 1
terabyte nvme drive now we ran in vme
territory and these drives are can be
significantly faster than even the
samsung qvo that I showed you earlier
2000 megabytes per second reads 1700
megabytes per second writes this is like
four times faster than that samsung
drive and for about the same price all
you need is a motherboard with an MDOT 2
slot and there you go now this isn't the
full PCIe gen3
saturation here that would usually cap
at it around I think
it's around 4 gigabytes per second but
the fact that we're getting 2000 pega
bytes per second what 2 gigs per second
is still incredibly fast especially at
this price point so yeah I added this
one in my card I think I'm gonna buy one
of these because I could I can never
have too many of these that's I go
through these pretty fast whenever I
give builds away or even if I build
something myself and sell it on
Craigslist or whatever it's nice to have
one of these in there because they're
easy to install and they're super fast
and buyers tend to like this next up
you've got a power color red dragon RX v
7e pretty much the same card that I
showed you from sapphire a bit earlier
about the same price as well still a
four gig card just from a different
company so maybe you're more comfortable
with sapphire maybe you're more
comfortable with power color doesn't
matter to me you have options out there
and it's nice to see multiple cards of
this caliber in this price range
next up we're in the meat and potatoes
of this video and that is CPU prices so
AMD is absolutely slaying it right now
in the prime day deals AMD Horizon 5
2600 for a hundred and twenty bucks one
hundred and twenty dollars that's a six
core 12 thread CPU is n plus a 12
nanometer will work with assuming you
have a bio BIOS flash you can work it
with B 350 or X 370 it'll work with B
450 or X 470 natively and then same goes
for X 570 so 120 bucks for that this is
a really really good D if I was building
a system in the $800 ish price range the
2600 would be the one that I would go
after in a heartbeat especially at this
price you can buy an $80.00 motherboard
with this that's $200 and then use that
60 or 70 K kit of course they're all px
vengence memory that I showed you and
then you get an entire platform front of
300 bucks so I think that's a really
compelling offer six cores again 12
threads great for streaming game great
for gaming even great for content
creation on a budget so this is
definitely one to consider yeah it's not
Zen to but it's pretty darn close and at
these prices it's it's just yeah that's
it's really tough to pass up and moving
on from that we have the horizon 720 700
X 4 200 bucks even you can see the list
price typically around 300 bucks for
this it was lower to about 250 around
the times then 2 became available and
now with a prime day we have a $200
price tag you can
to get the 2700 not x4 a little cheaper
now you won't get the beefiest cooler I
think this is the prism cooler here I
think you get the spire cooler I might
be wrong I know it's a smaller cooler
with a 2700 so if you plan on using a
stock cooler maybe this is like one
reason to go for the experience but in
general X variant CPUs from AMD aren't
gonna overclock much better than their
non x counterparts in the same family so
I would say the better deal would be the
2700 but 2700 X is still a great price
right now so 200 bucks yeah there you go
I mean if you were in the market now is
the time to buy all right one of the
last things we have here is the cooler
master this is the hyper 212 black
edition now we have reviewed this in
several videos you can check them out
somewhere in the cards up there but this
is the fully blacked out version it's
not that 212 Evo technically but the the
mounting system here is definitely
better in my opinion I think that it's
easier to install and it also looks
super sleek and for 25 bucks this is
like hyper t4 territory and you're going
to get it cooler that at least matches
if not outperforms the prism cooler that
you'll get out of the box with a 2700 X
and 3700 X and AMD CPUs of that sort so
25 bucks is a really great deal for this
and it's gonna look really good and
pretty much any build that has some
black accents in it now the very last
thing I wanted to show you is an i/o if
for some reason you wanna go with a i/o
over an air cooler deep cool has their
captain 240 RGB v2 this includes the
pressure relief valve which should
mitigate pressure spice you can see it
right there for 60 bucks is a 240 ml a
IO for 60 dollars it's one of the
cheapest a iOS I've ever seen now it's
not gonna stay here forever I don't
think but yeah so if you're in the
market for an a IO and 240 pretty much
fits most ATX builds then 60 bucks is a
steal in my opinion by the way this is
the rights of 720 700 us talking about
earlier 149 99 for this 150 bucks for 8
core 16 threads this is 12 millimeter
Zen plus we're talking about here gonna
get decent clocks out of the box let
things run a stock EXIF are 2 and a
precision boost are gonna pretty much
get these cores to as high as they can
possibly go if you try an all core over
clock again you're not gonna get as much
performance
you might out of a single-core under
those single or dual core workloads so
my take is just to leave things in stock
Andy does a really good job boosting
natively and 150 bucks for this one is
again I think a steal so yeah you want
to pair this for the next 470 x5 70 or
even be 450 motherboard even be 350 you
will work just fine in the 2700 I think
this is a 65 watt chip if I'm not
mistaken and yeah to me this is this is
the one to get for 150 bucks again
you're not gonna get as beefy a stock
cooler but just pick up that hyper 212
Black Edition and you're good to go with
this thing that'll be plenty for the CPU
in stock and should run pretty quiet as
well so honestly if I had to choose
between the 2700 at 150 or the 2700 X at
200 I picked this one the 2700 115
dollars this is like the cheapest I've
ever seen on Amazon on modern or
relatively modern eight core 16 thread
CPU so really good job from Amazon here
getting the price down as low as they
did and I'm sure Andy had something to
do with this as well alright so hope you
guys enjoyed these deals another plane
we're out there these are just the ones
that I found kind of just scrolling
through at 2 a.m. last night actually
this morning technically I don't yeah
that's just what I do
otama scroll through Amazon Newegg and
figure out what else to blow money on is
essentially how my life works also
Newegg livestream tomorrow we have the
fantastic stale stale sale to to run
through this pretty much the same thing
as prime day just from new eggs so it's
more us oriented but they have some
unique sales as well and you'll get to
see a lot of those in our live stream
tomorrow the caveat the catch it's a
good caveat is that we will be giving
away two thousand dollars worth of tech
daring the fantastic sale on new way so
if you happen to live in the u.s. and I
say the US cuz I have to be able to ship
it to you and Newegg is only a u.s.
distributor from those parts so that
would help I would hate to have to send
15 things to 15 different countries that
would be extremely expensive so I hope
you guys understand that this is more
us-based thing because it is Newegg
after all but anyway two thousand
dollars worth of stuff if you are living
in the States and you want to stop by 6p
tomorrow Central Standard or central
Daylight Time I live here in West
Florida so that's why it's central time
the 6 p.m. CST that's 7:00 p.m. est
that's what 5 4 p.m. Pacific and we'll
be giving away a bunch of stuff randomly
I have a two thousand dollar budget from
Newegg so yeah I was able to work them
up to a pretty sweet figure if I do say
so myself and we're excited to give it
all away to you guys so we're gonna just
hunt through tons of stuff find some
really good deals I'm gonna be like yeah
let's buy this let's give it away
someone in the chat to stop by and maybe
you'll win something thanks for watching
you guys happy hunting
daring crime day and happy hunting
tomorrow or the fantastic sale London
anyway you guys are awesome thanks again
for watching click the thumbs up button
click the subscribe button become a
member and I'll catch you in the next
one this is science studio thanks for
searching for good deals with us I am
getting so bad at this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
