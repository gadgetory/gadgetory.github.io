that is I probably spend the most time
on this machine and many of you were
asking what the specs were of my
personal rig so I've got it right here
in front of you and I'm gonna talk
briefly about the specs and then I also
want to get straight to the deal itting
because I'm a little frustrated with the
temperatures right now and I'm a little
too stubborn to switch out the cooler so
this isn't like a super beefy cooler
it's very modest this is the cry or eh 7
quad Lumi so it steps up the TDP just a
little bit over the regular h7 but with
the overclock that I have running on it
temperatures are getting pretty spicy
especially when I'm rendering so we're
gonna try D letting see if we can lower
those temps and maybe even crank out a
few extra hundred megahertz or so across
all six cores
if you're still looking for an
all-around excellent headset the
Sennheiser PC 37 X has you covered
excellent microphone incredible sound as
always from Sennheiser products and a
price that won't break the bank check
the link the video description for more
details so the system supports an Intel
Core i7 8700 K and it's running at 5
gigahertz right now like I said pretty
toasty especially on this like roughly
150 watt TDP cooler from crier rig but I
like the way it looks a lot and I'm
gonna set a person I want something to
look as good as it performs so I'm
trying to find a healthy middle ground
and that's why D linton's gonna come in
handy today the choice between an i7 and
an r7 CPU was a tough one I game mostly
on this system and that's where the i7
has a slight edge so that's why I've
stuck with this one of my personal rig
although I do most of my video editing
and rendering on the r7 2700 X custom we
build it's back behind me and that's
what I did this video one just for
example the gtx 1070 TI EVGA this is a
beefy 3 slot card here is a super quiet
card
I recommend it the 1070 Ti is a very
healthy metal ground between mid to
heavy 1440p gaming and even some light
4k game if you really want to get into
that eye game at 1440p 165 Hertz this
card is perfect for that
even a 1070 would be fine for it you
could probably squeak down to a 1063
limit drop some in game settings back
and pretty much max anything out in
1440p with this card and the the extra
power draw right with a 2 8 pin vga
supplemental power connections gives me
a healthy overclock as well I am running
I believe it's just 16 gigs of 3,000
megahertz Corsair dump lats I like the
way they look the silver complements the
motherboard nicely this is the Maximus
10 ROG board from a Suzy 370 of course I
have a 1000 watt be quiet power supply
in here it's semi modular but we have
custom sleeve cables from Tony his
channel is linked down below its ability
pc customs i love the stuff that he
doesn't miss channel i also love the
cables that he sends us he's like super
sexy and I've used them for like 10
builds now because I love purple I love
the ambience the the overall aesthetic
of this build I do have a couple more be
quiet silent weeks three fans up front
it's super quiet a relatively cheap
exhaust fan but I just turned this all
the way down
DC mode in the BIOS and that's basically
it storage I have
500 gig em got to drive behind the
graphics card and then I have a 2
terabyte hard disk drive in the front
here the case of course is a fractal
design mesh if I see I have the non
tinted tempered glass version that's
what I recommend I don't think that
tempered glass it's tinted would look
good with a build like this because it
would pretty much hide the cables and
other things that I want to show off and
that is about it so now we're gonna get
to the deleting process I'm gonna show
you step by step how I did it this is
the first time I've ever used liquid
metal - you know reattach the IHS to the
die and then I use a liquid metal again
to attach the cooler to the IHS so a
double layer of liquid metal and a
double layered sandwich of sorts it's
gonna be interesting I want to see what
the temps are hopefully it's worth it
hopefully I don't have a failed D lid
let's cross our fingers and let's go
through the steps alright so to start
things off we do need that baseline I
have the h7 quad Lumi cryocooler cooling
the 8500 k RV core is 1.35 I could
probably tweak that just a bit more but
I'm not worried about doing too many
things in the BIOS right now just
because it doesn't matter as long as we
keep the same settings before and after
the delayed so 1.3 5 volts and 5
gigahertz and here are the results
this is what we have up front I'm gonna
run out of 64 and get another set of
thermals just so we can compare two
different benchmarks and then we'll
throw some games at it and show again
before and afters there so the important
thing to note we had about 2% of thermal
throttling here on the cinnamon run and
now we're gonna run the I to 64 stress
test for about 10 minutes or so and see
our maximum thermal throttling
percentage also keep in mind T Junction
for coffee lake is approximately hundred
degrees Celsius meaning that anything at
or just below 100 degrees Celsius will
results in severe thermal throttling the
only two percent here isn't too
significant but we didn't have you know
straight up peg of 100 degrees during
our stress test it was just under that
so the CPU predicted that the cores
would reach that temperature and that's
why they thermal throttled before and
kind of despair itself which is a smart
technique and obviously you don't want
to see if you're running that hot all
the time so that's why thermal
throttling takes place T Junction is
again that threshold and we're gonna see
how quickly we hit it and how long we
can maintain at or just below T Junction
with the CPU thermal throttling for
about 10 minutes and ok I'm not gonna
let it go for 10 minutes turns out just
one minute will do it we're thermal
throw out
upwards of 25% and our cores are staying
pegged at or just below 100 degrees
Celsius I really feel comfortable we see
99 degrees on that one core there I
don't feel comfortable keeping the CPU
at this at these temperatures for very
long so I'm gonna go ahead and stop it
and that was more less to preview that
it's relatively stable and we're again
gonna take this result here I guess
we'll just do a one-minute comparison
between the two it's not uh it's not a
very accurate comparison because the
time span is so short but this is the I
mean this is a dire situation we're in
right running at 5 here it's one point
three five volts on coffee lake so let's
go ahead and deal it and then I'll tally
up some numbers and we'll compare them
in some graphs and see just what the
deltas actually were so the daily keep
we're gonna use today comes straight
from Durr Bower in Germany we used his
i-90 lead kit in this video right here
and I was very impressed with how easy
it was to use I do it at a two thousand
dollar processor that's how much I
trusted his products so I fully endorse
their Bower delayed kits if you guys
want to do it anything I recommend going
straight through him these tools are
very well-made very efficient very easy
to use basically stress-free I think the
cat is destroying stuff in the
background so like I said the deal in
process with this kit is very simple you
have two primary components here this is
the base plate whatever you want to call
it I just call it the base plate it's
got their Bowers logo on it it's got a
white arrow right here and this denotes
the orientation of the CPU so line this
white arrow up like you would and socket
of a motherboard that is the correct
orientation CPU should be sitting when
you delete it take this tool right here
it's just a small bracket that slides
into the base plate and you're gonna
wedge it fully against the IHS of the
CPU and then take this screw thread it
through the base plate until it becomes
very difficult to turn anymore basically
you're pulling this bracket into the IHS
that's how you're gonna delay the CPU
it's not going to take much force but
the coffee lay excuse it took a lot more
force with the i9 that's why that
delayed tool was much beefier but this
one here maybe one or two turns passed
when you can't turn any more of your
fingers using this tool will remove the
IHS you'll see it kind of slide forward
not
and that will indicate that it has
become detached from the substrate below
it basically it's glued right to the
chip and when you dislodge that glue the
IHS will kind of slide around you can
kind of pry it up any way you want just
be careful because you don't want to
damage the dye underneath now this is
where opinions begin to shine because
there isn't one set way to do this next
part when you have the IHS removed
I recommend scrubbing all of the glue
residue off of the chip at first and
then you can decide from there whether
you want to remove it also from the IHS
and then reglue the IHS after you have
added the liquid metal or you could keep
the glue residue on the IHS and just
decide to let the IHS rest over the chip
which is what I did so I actually didn't
use any glue to attach the IHS back to
the substrate it just kind of sits there
as long as you turn your case down you
just let the IHS rest there when you
install it into the socket you don't
have to really worry about the glue
because the mechanism itself includes a
lot of tension right so the IHS isn't
gonna move around once you secure the
socket lever and that's exactly what I
did you can see I had no problems with
it and that's almost recommended because
you could apply too much glue if you
don't know what you're doing
between the IHS and the substrate and
that would result in a too big of a gap
between the die and the IHS meaning that
you're gonna have improper contact he
won't transfer efficiently and your deal
it will fail I've also heard of people
using double sided tape to temporarily
hold the IHS in place kind of getting
ahead of ourselves though because we
haven't actually applied the liquid
metal yet a speaking of that I went with
thermal Grizzlies conduct a notch stuff
and this is pretty mainstream for liquid
metal dee lids I recommend them
essentially you want to wipe everything
down with these alcohol pads then make
sure everything is dry and then add just
a tiny pinprick of liquid metal to the
die you can use the included cotton
swabs to spread it all out it can be a
little stubborn the surface tension on
this stuff is very weird it doesn't
behave like water it's actually like
super sticky in a way even though it's
not like glue it's very runny so be
careful and you don't want this stuff to
run over the edge of your CPU because
remember it is conductive this is
conducted on after all it took a while
but I spread it out as evenly as I could
even when it seems like there's not
enough on there trust me there is you're
also going to want to apply some to the
eye
side of the CPU as well try to keep it
as consistent as possible the IHS really
only makes contact with a die over the
die surface area so if you are spreading
it over extra parts of the IHS you're
really doing yourself no good because
those parts of the chip don't really
produce any viable heat you can see
mine's not perfect but as long as you're
covering all the die area you should be
fine but remember the closer you get to
perfection the more efficient the IHS of
the cpu will be this isn't like direct
die mounting right that's even more
efficient because we're removing a
thermal barrier but it's pretty darn
close and direct die mounting is just a
pain especially with these kinds of
sockets the next thing I did was lay my
case down flat I want the socket
pointing up because I did not glue my
IHS remember so it's gonna slide around
especially for installing this
vertically I don't want that I don't
want to have to hold the IHS in place
all the time so lay it down flat and
then if you press on the IHS enough it
will not move when you install the
socket when you remount it and remember
that's gonna put a lot of pressure on
the IHS so it won't move after that we
can now lay our case back up right now
upon first boot again you shouldn't have
to you know clear your seamos there's
really nothing that's gonna change here
because all you did was remove your CPU
and effectively reinstall it so
everything should be able to remain the
same you will have to go in and
recalibrate anchors and all that good
stuff you will don't want to check
temperatures right away because if you
notice a really you know sharp dip in
idles and low temperatures then you're
gonna want to probably take advantage of
the extra overclocking Headroom if not
you're gonna have a super quiet system
maybe that's what you were going for
either way it's a win-win alright and
initial results right after the deal
it'd the exact same specs the exact same
BIOS settings 1.3 5 v core and 5
gigahertz check out these temps in I 264
so this is the CPU stress test and you
can see we have about a 20 to 25 degree
Delta by doubling down on our liquid
metal application so we have liquid
metal between the die and the IHS
and between the IHS and the cryo rig CPU
cooler you can see we're coming up in on
the 10 minute mark and we have
absolutely no CPU throttling there's no
reason for it to exist because our
temperatures are well below t-junction
right now we're hovering just under
ninety degrees Celsius and with an air
cooler it's gonna basically be level
by this point temperature-wise so this
is the peak you can see temperatures are
relatively stable they do dip down quite
a bit it's not as consistent as I would
have hoped so occasionally can see these
cores are dropping to about 70 degrees
Celsius that core hit that's the highest
temperature I've seen yet 93 degrees
Celsius this just might not be a very
well pinch if you see some people
getting five point to five point three
gigahertz with their 8700 KS this is a
marketing sample it's a sample that they
sent to motherboard manufacturers so
they're not gonna be the best they're
more or less used for bio stability
testing and that's probably why the
results here aren't that great but I
wasn't looking for extreme overclock by
any means I just wanted a cooler system
a quieter system overall and that's
exactly what we have with these temps
here and this isn't you know the
beefiest cooler around this is a pretty
modest cooler 150 or so watt TDP so it's
doing a great job given the
circumstances staying relatively quiet
under full load so I'm gonna summarize
these graphs just a bit definitely a
sharp drop in especially idle
temperatures the idles at 5 gigahertz at
1.3 5 volts before or about 45 degrees
Celsius or so those dropped to about 35
between 35 and 40 really every core kind
of goes up and down and that can vary
depending on whether or not you're
manually setting your V core or if you
have an offset or if you're letting it
run auto which I don't recommend because
a lot of these motherboards will pump
too much voltage through the CPU
especially when you don't need it
they're gonna run harder than normally
systems gonna run louder than normal
just manually set it and you'll be
better off trust me now in regards to
loads we also saw a significant drop in
overall temperatures from 95 and a
hundred degrees Celsius initially
without the delayed to about 75 it was
between 75 and 85 degrees Celsius
usually it did spike just a little bit
occasionally sometimes we'd hit 90
degrees Celsius and I think that just
has to do with the fact that all I was
really doing was tweaking the voltage
that's it I wasn't playing with base
clock or anything else in the BIOS so
maybe I can fine-tune it I'm actually
right now running at 1.32 volts so I was
able to squeak it down just a little bit
the deal it won't really fix that the
CPU is itself is actually gonna
determine the you know voltage tolerance
not really the delay the tea lid just
fixes a temperature aspect of the issue
so I could actually you know
voltage just a bit more coulda done that
beforehand as well but overall about 80
to 85 degrees Celsius at our full load
and that's at 5 gigahertz across all six
cores which is impressive for any CPU
let alone one that originally runs
pretty hot so in closing if you consider
yourself an enthusiast I strongly
recommend this kit if you're rocking an
i7 or I fire from the last two or so
generations KB lay coffee like
especially they're gonna benefit the
most from the D lid and honestly I mean
how many CPUs do you hear about being
RMA usually it's the motherboard or the
power supply even the graphics card or
storage drive right now how many CPUs
legitimately died just from running hard
even when you're gaming or content
creating so unless you royally screw
something up there in the dilute process
it's worth the boarding the warranty it
really is it sucks that we have to do it
Intel should never use that terrible
thermal interface material that they've
been using ever again
hopefully the next generation is
soldered on like rise ins but it's Intel
you know I'm not gonna hold it in to
really tiny
nothing's gonna surprise me from them at
this point so yeah it sucks we have to
do it but ultimately it's what we have
to do if we want great overclocks
and herb our skit is the one I do
recommend I've actually used two
different delayed kits and this is the
one I prefer because it's so simple to
use straight up you know a few different
tools here you combine and the delayed
process like I said takes about five
minutes it's very quick you know to to
apply the liquid metal which is a very
inconsistent liquid it's definitely
different than water the way it behaves
and then reapplying your CPU cooler all
that jazz will take about thirty minutes
in total but it's worth it it's worth
the price of the kit and it's worth a
warranty void in my opinion again though
