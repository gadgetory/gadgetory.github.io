any of you like some pie
no no not that time this pie all these
numbers just kidding that was actually
one of the first videos in the minute
science playlist one of the first videos
on the channel period over a year ago pi
day recently passed so I'll be paying
tribute to that by repeating that video
you just saw a few of the things I'll
say in the beginning will sound very
redundant but then we'll dive deeper
into the topic
are you ready would any of you like some
pie no no no not that pie this pie all
of these numbers in 1706 William Jones
was the first person to ever associate
the word pie but it's now familiar
symbol but what is pie let's start off
first the familiar equation you like we
saw in geometry circumference equals pi
times diameter if we simply isolate pi
the right-hand side equals the quotient
of circumference and diameter that's it
that's the mathematical definition of pi
but why then does it never terminate why
is pi an irrational number this is where
things get dicey though the principle
itself is rather rudimentary you ready
nothing in nature is perfectly circular
got it that's the only thing you need to
accept in order for what I'm about to
say to make sense
everything has ridges grooves
microscopic canyons in fact we can't
even simulate perfect circles using
computers because the math never
terminates that and our displays use
square pixels to that's a separate issue
but even if a perfect circle did exist
we could never accurately measure it
with man-made tools down to a specific
digit granted that's the case for any
measurement significant figure is anyone
nevertheless straight lines have
definite length so that computers can
calculate the case however for curved
surfaces so here's a way you can attempt
to calculate pi good luck good luck
let's start with a triangle if we
inscribe an equilateral triangle that's
the triangle with three equal sides
inside of a circle we can use the sine
rule to solve for the length of each
side of the triangle we assume a circle
diameter of one meter each side of the
triangle must equal approximately 0.866
eaters now we've already encountered an
irrational number root three and this
equation never terminates so our
calculation from here on out will not be
exact
but let's keep going anyway with 0.866
meters for one side the perimeter of the
triangle is roughly two point five nine
eight point eight six six times three as
a ratio the triangle has an outer length
that is roughly 83% of the circles
length accounting for a 17 percent error
now let's move on to a square arresting
perfectly inside of a circle if the
diameter of the circle is 1 meter then
with some simple geometry we can
calculate the side length of the square
one over the square root of 2 or roughly
0.707 again another irrational number
let's just ignore it pi times 1 for the
circle yields a circumference of
3.14159265 yadda-yadda-yadda
it's pi basically and the perimeter of
the square is about 2.8 - 8 meters as a
ratio the square has an outer length
that is roughly 90% of the circle length
accounting for in this case only a 10%
error can you see where things are
headed at this point as we increase the
number of equilateral sides to the shape
inscribed inside the circle we gradually
approach the length of a perfect circle
ergo the true value of pi but the limit
of the number of sides here approaches
infinity no shape no matter how many
sides it has will ever become a true
circle this inner shape could have 1
billion sides for all we care
you'd be very close to PI but not at ty
and that's why it's an approximation
that's why it never terminates happy
late PI day everyone I hope you enjoy
the math in this one be sure to give a
thumbs up if you thought it was cool
thumbs down so the opposite click or
subscribe if you haven't already now
catch you in the next video this is
Salazar studio thanks for learning with
this
