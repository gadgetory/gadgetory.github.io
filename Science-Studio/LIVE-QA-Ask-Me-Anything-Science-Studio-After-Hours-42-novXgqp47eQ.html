one of the first times I've actually
been somewhat on time I mean what
classifies as being late is it like a
minute some of you guys go crazy if I'm
like thirty seconds late where is quick
quick and look I get it right you've
been waiting here a while and I
appreciate those of you who especially
have been waiting for 30 or so minutes
ever since I created the little
livestream pop-up I should be doing this
Wayne that Wayne advanced like it
benefits the streamer to have these live
streams posted and advanced YouTube just
seeds it better and they tend to perform
better but I kind of do these
last-minute just because like there's
nothing really formal about the live
streams I've said this before like my
whole point the whole point of these
live streams is just to be real with you
guys and just talk to you unscripted
give you my raw feedback my my opinions
regarding certain topics answer any
questions you have
speaking of which questions regarding
Zen to which arise in 3000 series chips
will be ignored I'm gonna say it upfront
we obviously cannot say anything because
of the nba's we all agreed to when we
were sent the kits I can talk a little
bit about x57 if you'd like some
discussion about that but for the most
part yeah anything impression wise what
do I think of right I can't say anything
now because I have the chips now so
anything that I that I know about
performance wise it's gonna kind of leak
out if I talk about my impressions or
anything like that I just don't want to
touch it so stay tuned I mean this is
coming up within next week or so so
you'll have tons and tons of yeah input
from a lot of different tech tubers
someone saying my volume is low I am in
a yellow so it is your volume you should
probably turn yourself up or turn me up
I guess I should say let's see
Nickolas asking what i think about
huawei not getting google updates
you should watch mike huawei video
because i have a video of literally
talking about that but let's see here
Rep Ron Rapp bro no I don't know how to
say that he says hey science studio I've
been looking at a build building a new
PC and I'm torn between the newest i5
processor newest i7 want to play games
at 144 FPS and stream well I think if
you want to stream then and you're going
with Intel no matter what I think the i7
is the better bet hands down obviously
because you didn't mention a and B in
that I think it would be kind of a it
wouldn't be right at me to bring up an
AMD although I think you should still
consider it strongly cuz you're gonna
get more value on the streaming side of
things I think out of AMD but if you're
just going for sheer frame rates and
maybe some occasional streaming then I
would definitely go with the i7 over the
i-5 let's see do I like cookies the
answer is yes but it depends on the type
of cookie there's a lot of gross cookies
out there people put some weird stuff in
their cookies I like very simplistic
cookies like sugar cookies
snickerdoodles that's really about it I
don't like anything else
chocolate chip like that's the de-facto
cookie but yeah Dotson the new Chaya
Taichi look the the Tai Chi's are really
nice board there's a ton of features in
that board I haven't even gone through
half of the features yet I'm trying to
put together a feature set for a video
dedicated to that board but it is an
expensive board and I keep
re-emphasizing this because AMD told us
this specifically when we were talking
about chipset support back at Computex X
570 is not required to run Xen 2x 470
from what they told me is gonna be the
by far the better value chipset and a
lot of people are probably already gonna
have x4 70 or even be 450 like they were
telling me you can overclock on B 450
like even the 12 courtship so this of
course Falls kind of on the hands of the
motherboard manufacturers and how
future-proof and how tolerant in terms
of power delivery those boards are but I
would say most of you are gonna be just
fine with X 470 the only real reason
my opinion to upgrade to X 570
especially if you already have X 470 is
if you want to take advantage of PCI 4
and the new faster m dot 2 drives which
will be testing I should say envy me
drives there right there
there's say 2 m dot 2 which is like
that's limited by the SATA interface so
it's gonna be really slow comparable to
envy me which is going to be
lightning-fast especially on PCI for if
you're using a PCI for Drive so that's
really the only upside to it that I can
see apart from just better power
management I mean these boards are gonna
be made for the 12 cords 16 core chips
right they're gonna have two 8 pin CPU
connectors for example like they're
they're ready for power but when it
comes down to like the actual
practicality of it for the average
consumer I really think a lot of you are
gonna be better off with X 4 70 or even
before 50 I mean that and I'm gonna be
testing risin Zen - I've already been
testing on on X 570 but I'm gonna be
testing a lot on be 450 and X 470 as
well just so you guys get a well-rounded
synopsis of what's good and what's not
and if you can overclock and how much
you can overclock compare it to the
newest and latest chipset I've got one
super set up here from Mac Fisher one
dolla appreciate that Mike Fisher right
under that a question from Merc 305
should it upgrade from risin 720 700 to
send - for gaming I can't say I can't I
said this in the beginning of the
livestream I can't talk about and I'm
not gonna talk about Zen to performance
it's not gonna happen I just won't do it
cuz I did I think it's it's it's
blurring the lines between what the
indie actually says I can do and what I
can't
let's see Sebastian how's it going
looking good with those five stars next
to your name I appreciate the membership
that's that's what like six months at
least to get the five stars actually
maybe more than that I don't know but
that's awesome
I appreciate it let's seek here another
super check from Jorge is how you say it
Jorge I want to say George but if you're
a Spanish probably Jorge Valentine $10 C
which I appreciate that so today my
girlfriend is into video editing and
she'd like to know the best PC specs are
for that I was thinking maybe I 7 and
1080 GPU would be good but I'd like your
advice
so yeah video editing for sure I would
go with Intel at least for right now
it's if she's gonna use premiere which
is what I expect she'll be I mean that's
like the that's the one that everyone I
should say everyone that's when I've
used quite a bit I'm very knowledgeable
and premier although there are still a
ton of things I don't know about the
software but I'm using it for a few
years and if you're gonna use premiere
specifically then I would tell her to go
with Intel for sure and Intel Core i7
you could get away with a 9700 K even a
9600 K if you want to go with AI 5 that
would still work and then a 1080 would
be great especially with premiere CUDA
accelerations gonna you'll be benefited
by an NVIDIA GPU so I would say yeah at
least a 1070 1080 even or if you want to
go with RT X and something like a 2060
would be just fine for a lot of what
she's probably gonna be doing if you're
not going with with Premiere Pro she's
gonna be using like DaVinci Resolve or
something then I would go straight up
for the highest court count chip I can
get and in that case I would probably
switch back to horizon I know hardware
can actually think did a video talking
about that I mean DaVinci Resolve is by
far more stable and that is something
I've been trying to slowly transition
into I did one a couple of my videos at
Computex this year on DaVinci Resolve
and it was so much better for some
reason on my laptop Premiere Pro just
gets a little iffy and will crash every
now and then and so I tried DaVinci
Resolve and it wasn't as fast for
rendering as premiere was granted I had
the MX 115 there so I can do the quick
sync encoding for for premiere so it
speeds it up if you have a dedicated GPU
but and from what I've heard so far if
she's gonna use DaVinci Resolve and I
would go for higher core count that
would mean rise in seven you can get a
lot more kick for the money with her
eyes and stuff so depends on the
software suite she's using let's see
here mantastic trooper twelve three ten
what phone do you have the phone I am
rocking now is the pixel three XL I have
actually pixel three Axl this is a
sample Google sent and I've been using
it for the past I've been kind of
switching honestly between that and
my pixel three non Excel the regular
pixel three which they also sent like a
few months ago and I can't really decide
which one I like more from a value
perspective definitely the 3a is the
better phone but when you take into
account everything like what you're
trading off I still say that pixel 3a is
a better phone it's just I know that not
everyone's gonna think that it's a
slower phone noticeably but is it really
like that like if you're super impatient
or you're used to having a
lightning-fast phone maybe you're on
iPhone and you want to switch to Android
which is noticeably slower in some tasks
then mainly because for one that the the
processors and Apple phones are designed
specifically with that software in mind
so they just work so beautifully
together and they work so fast so coming
from an iPhone I would say it'd be a
pretty pretty hard kick in the teeth
switch into it a pixel 3a but if if
speed is not really a huge concern of
yours then the pixel 3a is one of the
best value phones right now and I I
would say it's almost I haven't touched
the oneplus 7 yet but it's it's it's
close I mean it's it's close to my
perceived value that I see in the
oneplus 7 obviously I'm going to be a
little more expensive but you're getting
a lot for oneplus has always been
affordable they've been like the
affordable budget oriented non-budget
phone right so have like high-end specs
but an affordable price tag which is
good the three is kind of like that but
it's gonna noticeably slower what
Snapdragon 635 and it I think again I
don't see it too much I really just see
it when I'm taking HDR photos because it
doesn't have a dedicated HDR processor
or whatever it is in it and that's
really about it
battery life is way better on the 3a
than it is on the three granted they're
different battery sizes and screen sizes
but still okay moving on here let's see
I'm gonna scroll Thomas I saw this
earlier he says shouldn't reviewers have
a list of game selected for reviews that
is independent of each review so that
there can be no bias lightning games and
I see where you're coming from with that
but the problem is games that there's
always a new game coming out
and everyone always wants sorry about
that everyone always wants something new
to be released or something new to be to
be benchmarked and so you can't really
stick with this
I mean I've stuck with a lot of games
over the years because like GTA 5 I've
used GTA 5 a lot because it's a baseline
I know exams are gonna fall and that's
something that I definitely benchmarked
for Zen to that we have here but some
other games I've moved away from like
city skylines I used to benchmark with
that game I moved away from it it was
very if he went up and down a lot
because there's no built-in benchmark
for one and for two it's only like a
three core powerhouse like if you have
anything more than three chords you're
not gonna see much in the way of
benefits so I don't really think that
saying that it's less biased to stick
with the same suite in every video I
don't think that's necessarily true
although I know what you're getting at
but I can say for sure like it varies
from test to test for me especially when
it comes to like rate racing right so I
have to use a certain certain games for
that like battlefield 5 I don't like
benchmarking battlefield 5 because I
don't like origin I don't like when I
benchmark that game it'll lock me out
after five or six swaps of hardware I
don't like that I try to stick the steam
games for the most part just because
it's easily accessible my entire
libraries on there and it's just no
hassle but yeah I don't really think
that's a thing I just I don't I mean if
I was purposely trying to benchmark
games that I knew would favor a me over
Intel or vice-versa
you guys would know and you would call
me out on it in Mass like it's different
if there's like one or two people
complaining there's always it's always a
fanboy somewhere that's pissed off
you're not gonna be able to please
everybody but as long as the general
populace is content with the games that
you've tested and doesn't see any
inherent bias and I would say there's no
problem and for the most part the games
are testers that are the same but every
now and then I'll sneak a new title in
there just to see how it does I don't
think there's anything wrong with that
okay I'm scrolling down here Christian
eight core or six core for streaming
depends if simultaneous multithreading
is baked into that if you're talking
about well if it's Intel or AMD doesn't
matter hyper threading SMT I would say
if six cores if you have six cores and
multi
threading then you're fine I wouldn't
get the a chorus for streaming you could
get the a-kor for streaming it would be
better you'd have more hardware overhead
you have more threads to utilize
obviously but from a value perspective I
think the six core 12 thread is a is a
better value streaming chip than an 8
core 16 thread which tends to cost
around 100 to 200 bucks more ok
scrolling down here just trying to fly
through these folks visa set pixel
bezels look old and ugly I disagree III
straight-up disagree I think the race to
get a full screen phone like like a 90
95 % screen to body ratio I think it's a
stupid race it just it makes you
compromise on so many important things
including front-facing speakers which I
love about the pixels including a
speaker grille that actually you know
you can put it up to your head and you
don't have to worry about any of that
weird distortion or high-pitched tones
that you get with some of the crappier
smaller slimmer speakers or even the
ones that have to fire through the phone
screen you also compromise the location
of the front-facing camera I have to do
something weird like what Asus does with
the flip camera or you have to have a
pop up camera like it's just it's a
waste to me I would rather have thin
bezels on the top and bottom and be able
to actually put hardware that belongs
there in those places without
compromising on build quality or some
weird functionality of the phone ok
scrolling down
JJ JJ JJ says something-something fam
love your vids keep them what you love
happy creators a good create I
appreciate that thank you
see we got a super chat here from mister
from Oh from Jorge Valentine Oh George
okay sorry about that George
I appreciate you correct me on that is
this alright cool is she'll be using
premiere yeah so if she's an premiere
definitely intel that that's that's what
I use I use the 9900 cane here for Intel
even if I didn't have a 9900 K I would
use the 8700 K over risin 7 and we're
talking older Jen I'm not speaking about
Zen to if it changes you'll know my
opinion on it later ok but yeah I
appreciate that thank you again let's
see ok era it's asking about the lawsuit
rewind in the livestream might answer
that are there Tom are $10 super chat
okay he wants Pepsi to be answering the
questions Betsy I don't know if she's uh
I don't know if she's prepared you but
you know what you you threw some money
at me son I feel obligated now Pepsi
she's a very squirmish cat and she yes
so we we gotta be hey baby hey she's
actually being pretty true right now oh
yeah now she's not now she's not okay go
ahead go ahead go go ahead okay she's
she's one of those cats that like she'll
sleep all day and when she's not
sleeping she's extremely energetic it's
probably why she's energetic cuz that's
probably the correlation but she's if
she wants to go out and I close the door
so she might want to be going out oh
Michael Moore Alice $4.99 super chat
preciate that well the high-end experts
anyone who's really be able to handle
3900 extra thoughts I already talked
about this a little earlier in
livestream I'll say it very briefly
again I am
told me yes they should they should and
I'm gonna test that so stay tuned the
next week or so you'll know the answer
to that question for sure but I've got a
3900 X here and after I run my test in X
570 I will be swapping to X 470 and
you'll know because I'll push it just as
hard if not harder
I'll throw whatever voltage I have to
and I don't care if I fry the chip I'll
do what I have to to see if I can get it
to the same frequency and if so how
stable it is at that frequency and at
that voltage and how hot the arms are
because I'm sure that's that's a
plausible concern as well actually
scrolling down here but she asked which
case right now would you recommend for
the best air flow best air flow if you
watch our case reviews we have cases
like a whole list of cases the best air
flow cases that I've tested are the P
600's from fantex that nylon mesh on the
front end top does a heck of a lot
it really is porous and it allows a lot
of air in unimpeded also the mesh F is -
is a really good case for that trying to
think of some other cases and it's like
if we just want a really Airy case I
mean anything with a mesh front panel
it's not like a double or triple mesh
like what enter max did you have to
modify that take out that second dust
filter but in my experience the two
cases that I've tested recently that are
really good in terms of air flow are the
P 600 s and the mesh bias - for obvious
reasons banana bread oh for $5 super
tight I appreciate that how's the
lawsuit going I said this early in the
livestream I feel that I can I can't say
anything else right now and I won't
until I have heard back from both my
lawyers and the magistrate who is in
charge of the case so you'll know when I
know it what happens whether or not the
magistrate decides Indiana has
jurisdiction so if they have
jurisdiction then we'll be going to
court and we'll actually have to defend
ourselves and we will but that's all I'm
gonna say
not for now what's going on quasars good
evenin mate what's up dude
what specs would you recommend for a 600
ollar system we've got a few 600 Ock
builds on the channel for right now I
mean I'd have to really go back and look
at the top of my head if I can remember
what parts would amount to 600 bucks I
would go rise in five like 1600 you can
get those for really cheap now like a
hundred bucks or less that's a really
good starting point be 350 motherboard
for like 50 bucks 60 bucks you want to
buy used you get you know eight or 16
gigs of DDR for upgrade to 16 when you
can in your budget get a $200 graphics
card like if you want to buy new you
could get like a 10 60 or if you want to
buy use you could possibly get a 10 70
if they're still in you know if people
are still selling them at decent prices
on eBay which they might not be just
depends but around a 10 60 you could
even get like an RX 580 for a hundred
hundred and twenty hundred forty bucks
in some cases so let me let Pepsi out
real quick she wants but yeah I don't
know why I'm looking the way over there
to answer these quite a chat box over
here okay we go alright Alex has walked
through science studio if I want a
dual-channel config do I need to buy a
kit or can I just get two separate
identical sticks getting them separate
is a lot cheaper for me sorry free Pete
yeah you should be able to get it to run
with two separate sticks no problem
you'll have to check cash Layton sees
and timings those things tend to differ
from module to module unless of the
exact same SKU but yeah as long as
you're running one in slots a1 or a2 and
then the other and slots b1 and b2 which
a and B or your two channels right so
that's why you have to space them out on
most conventional boards then you should
be able to run a dual channel there
shouldn't be a problem in fact you could
use two different sticks from two
different companies like you could
probably get that to work too I haven't
done that because it looks weird most of
the time but that in theory could also
work
let's see yeah Dodd says I think
reviewers should only use games they're
actually playing for benchmark yeah a
problem with that is I only play like
three games so my like the only games
that I play are GTA 5 City skylines and
like Call of Duty like black ops 3 which
is old so it kind of wouldn't be a great
testing suite if I just use the games
that I play but uh let's see SOPs casual
corner science to do would be comparing
any of the x99 CPUs just hoping someone
will have some benchmarks including I
have 5 5820k
and/or 59 60 X looking to upgrade I
don't have my 5820k anymore it's an
older CPU
I mean look you're gonna know based on
like all you'd have to do is just put
two and two together so if you know how
your your CPU stacks up against an 8700
K for example then all you have to do is
just see how well the 3900 X compares
stacks up against the 8700 K and then
you know where you were stance right so
there's the kind of like combine both
deltas that's as close as gonna get for
me I'm not gonna go that far back house
well he is just has what you brought
away like that that era of X 99 chips I
don't really think it's worth going back
for because a majority of my viewers are
still on consumer-grade stuff I mean
that's for obvious reasons it's just
more affordable and typically there's
more value there for the average user
but I will be comparing I'll be using
the 8700 K as a baseline I'll be using
mainly CPUs have fallen to the same
price categories as the 3900 X and a
3700 X which are the two that I have
here so if it falls around the same
price as the 3900 X it'll be compared to
the third 900 X if it falls around the
same price as a 3700 X then it'll be
compared I'm not worried about
mismatching cores or any of that because
Rison buyers typically tend to favor
value over sheer performance which
they'll openly admit and I frankly agree
with that assessment in most cases
unless you absolutely need the best for
whatever reason like in my case with
premier I definitely benefit from Intel
at this point and so I will pay the
Intel tax to have those advantages in
premiere because that's a large part of
what I do
my PC right but for the average user who
maybe just plays games and streams
occasionally does a lot of like Chrome
tabbing and stuff like that you know
like stuff that's not super productive
in that sense unless you I guess
streaming would count for that but
nothing that's like super professional I
don't know I don't want to offend
anybody but like unless you're doing
some really super hardcore compiling or
just like some something that requires
you to use either AMD or Intel
I would tell most people to buy Intel
strictly because he get more value for
your dollar and that's something that
I'm sure many people would echo but I
and to just compare things on the basis
of price because I think price to
performance is a fair assessment and
it's an assessment I frankly should have
been I should have been doing that from
the beginning I was kind of just doing
well this has six cores in this so six
core so which one's better well if this
one's better
but it's not on the camera if this one's
better but it costs more whoop-dee-doo
who cares right the whole point is these
two price these two CPUs are the same
price so which one's better for the
price that's that's what I want to
answer in my rise in 3000 reviews so
that's my approach I don't expect
everyone will take that approach but
that will be mine so at least you know
what to expect
pictures asking you about my opinion on
the Arctic's super lineup leak or Nvidia
trying to piss off
piss on Andy's launch I don't know much
about I don't follow these kinds of
leaks anymore I just don't care if it
comes out it comes out and and then I'll
tell you what I think but right now I
just it doesn't seem all that fantastic
to me so I haven't really done much in
the way of research regarding it so yeah
I kind of feel bad I don't have much
more to say about it victors but it's
just it's the Greeks just you could go
into an endless pit with leaks and I
just don't want I don't want my channel
to become that so I'll talk about it
occasionally alive screams I just don't
know enough about it to tell you much
about my opinion let's see
music any update in lawsuit you'll know
when I have an update on a lawsuit
you'll have a video on from me on the
channel with an update
it's a unique gamer $5.00 our I don't
know what our currency is but I
appreciate that but see it says hey my
first live stream what max of erm temps
do you recommend for an r5 1600 for
Geiger's 1.35 volt I don't know the way
that I measure the RM temps there's you
can do it in software but I will probe
and that's because I know exactly where
I want to probe every time I test for
temps I can't recall the top of my head
what I was comfortable with especially
with like the cheaper a320 boards that
we tested you have to go back and watch
my a320 board review because I think I
throw up a few different vrm temps that
I had probed myself just to show you
kind of like a baseline and like a more
worst-case scenario yeah if you're
running at one point three five volts at
four gigahertz your bio star is probably
gonna be just fine like it would take a
lot unless it was just terrible theorems
to bring you know to bring that up to a
level that I would say is concerning
let's see pic Co has a 165 Hertz one
1440p at 300 I think that's the they
don't want me to review that one that is
the Hayabusa I wanna say the bike but if
I pretty sure that's the one that
they're talking about
that's an incredible value but it is I
believe a TN display and I'm not sure
about colors like if it's that cheap
they if it's that cheap they had to make
a compromise somewhere else
everyone would be cutting you know
manufacturers off of the knees to get
those extremely low prices in there for
those for those monitors so I will see
I'm gonna review one for sure I just
have to make time in space and right now
with Rhys and it's just it's consuming
my entire work week so we'll see
go fasta at science to do have you seen
those next-gen iPhone design leaks don't
you think it's too ugly for an Apple
phone yeah look I've never really hated
iPhones does iPhone designs I can't
really recall the iPhone 5c was a little
look a little like toyish like kiddush I
thought the white one looked okay but
like it was just i phone 5 see to me was
like the bane of the iPhones existence
and then really after that the 5s was
good I liked the 4 and the 4s the 3s was
cool but and I remember some people were
complaining about the 4 because the 4
like was was you know it was sharp on
the edges and it was kind of more
squared-off around it right around the
edges and people hated that you know I
kind of cut into your hands more you
could feel the creases in the phone the
90-degree turns instead of the smooth
curved back like that was in the 3G and
3GS the 5 was fine yeah the 5 and 5s
were good the 6 success 7 the 8 like
they were all fine to me like I didn't
really think that they were ugly but
this this new design this it's the it's
the camera bump it just looks ugly in my
opinion if that's actually how this
thing looks like the camera thing they
could have just they could have done so
I would have preferred them to have
three lenses straight down in a line and
then put the flash off to the side or
something but the problem is the reason
why phones have bumps in the cameras
it's not because you know there's
anything under the camera that's really
like it's the camera itself that needs
to be that big the the lenses of spacing
between each of those lenses in there
and needs to be a certain distance and
if it's not then you compromise things
like no like just the ability to focus
up close or two maybe sharpness like
there's a lot of stuff to consider and
that's why lens spacing is really
important especially for small sensor
cameras like those in most smartphones
so they almost all have bumps for that
spacing the extra spacing they need it
was a certain point when phones were so
thick it didn't matter there were no
camera bums because the phones were
thicker than the camera bumps needed to
be but now the phones are so thin the
cameras themselves it's kind of hard to
shrink a camera when you're talking
about you know actual lenses that need
to be in place and and a sensor size to
boot that's going to matter so they they
have bumps and I the Apple iPhone
whatever this one's gonna be yelling now
at 12 or whatever is just the 12 would
be the 11 I don't know I am I know they
have a 10 s and the 10s max and the 10
are so I assuming I guess that could be
the 11 I have no idea but yeah the bump
doesn't look that great to me it's good
question I think it was who was a Google
that leaked their own pixel for design
and people were initially complaining
because we saw some leaks that were I
shouldn't say that they leaked their own
they didn't leak it they teased it
that's it's a teaser a leak involves
unintentional you know distribution of
information but they tease did they
intentionally revealed it to an extent
and I think people were initially
complaining because you saw the
silhouette of the pixel for suppose it
picks before and it looked like the
iPhone the new iPhone with that big
camera bump but Google did a little
differently I feel like they had to
reveal it because so many people were
roasting them for copying Apple in every
industry you know every every industry
leader is going to copy a competitor at
some point somehow like that's just like
an inevitable thing I feel like you know
there's so much there's there's so many
ideas out there they're all bound to
kind of overlap to an extent right it's
very hard to find genuinely innovative
and totally independent ideas nowadays
so you know there
I remember reading some patent stuff on
I was just like reading a whole friggin
Wikipedia whatever like a 10 page
article about patents and there were so
many times in history when people were
claiming to invent the same thing at the
same time I and I know that the auto
engine was kind of kind of like this I
can't think off the top my head what it
was I was reading about specifically I
think it might have been I know the
engine had the internal combustion is I
had a lot of like competition a lot of
people supposedly doing the same thing
around the same time but I think it was
the transistor I was reading about one
of the first transistors used germanium
instead of silicon and supposedly there
had also been I don't know if this is
accurate I can't remember what it was I
was reading I think it was a transistor
supposedly there was another inventor of
a very very similar device somewhere
else and they had also filed a patent
you know when people file when multiple
parties file patents that are almost
identical like what does the Patent
Office do like you have to verify who
actually had the idea first and that's
really difficult to do especially like
you know in the 1930s 40s 50s and even
earlier than that it's hard to verify
that kind of stuff so let's see wow it's
going down here Fred
125 Filipino I don't know what that is
I think it's Filipino I appreciate that
ITEX question from a Dan case you sure
do you think we can get away with air
cooling the 3900 acts 39 50x
with a 125 LP cooler I can't talk about
the Zen 2i I said that earlier sorry I
don't I don't feel like he wasted the
question but I said earlier for obvious
reasons because of the NDA I'm not gonna
talk about anything cooling wise we
can't legally talk about it we can be
sued for it
we're not yeah we're just not doing it
so I'm not gonna mention anything about
performance cooling potential voltage
any of that stuff until the NDA is
lifted okay let's see here scrolling
down there is Brian I see Brian in the
chat I think I'm a little behind in the
chat here I'm pretty high up here
Brian says yeah Greg and I have well I
have to do livestream soon and we will
like four seriously we were in big talk
staring Kombi text about getting that
started back up we want to actually do
the do live streams that we kind of did
in the past but we wanted to be more
official we having a legit thing in
place and we want to do a lot of
giveaways and stuff and those so yeah I
think afters then - because we're all
slam packed with the Zen to launch so I
think after that we'll we'll have enough
time for sure we'll do it up let's see
scrolling down scrolling down someone
said my mic is low I'm in yellow like
some of you are complaining with a lot
of you aren't I can turn myself up a
little more but I don't want a peak so I
don't know what you guys are listening
to me on but it's showing me up there so
you know blast me on your speaker's if
you have to there's there's no other way
around it I don't want to peak for some
people because I'm pretty close to
peaking like when I when I pump up that
wasn't so bad I gotta like
you know it helps to have a pata filter
or whatever this is this is like a
really popular is in sorry okay scroll
and am Nick still being sued yep still
being sued talk about this early on live
stream rewind if he can see yeah Peter
Peters stress rather asking about dots
on the iPad Pro and iPad OS my thing
about tablets is they were never really
able to do what laptops did and that was
the reason why I never really pushed for
tablets because if you needed something
portable chances are you probably needed
it for a kind of a work purpose right
it's nice to have a bigger screen to
watch YouTube videos but the
practicality of that honestly with
phones being as big as they are now in
my opinion is kind of overrule the
viability of a tablet altogether I know
that iPads the new iPad pro is looking
really soft
lisa has the last gen iPad pro with the
120 Hertz screen is it looks really nice
a screen is a it's a really nice display
of course retina as well and it's a very
slim iPad pro but I don't see the value
latina she makes it work but for what I
do there's no way I could even with a
keyboard it's just too weird and awkward
for me and the operating system I think
is a big is a big downside to that I
would almost always rather use my
ultrabook and I get around the same
battery life a little worse it depends
on what I'm doing tablets tend to last a
bit longer but they're lower overhead
right so if I'm like editing and stuff
I'm gonna need my laptop for sure and
that's really the only time I have my
laptop outside of the studio like I'll
use my laptop in the house to like type
script up if I'm sitting on the couch
but for the most part if I'm using a
laptop for serious things it's gonna
require a lot of horsepower it's gonna
be because I'm on a trip somewhere that
requires me to edit and I would much
rather do that on the laptop that no
iPad pro so that's the only reason why
I've never really pushed for more
advocated then let's just not my I'm not
the target audience for it one on one
heroes I answered the huawei question a
bit earlier let's see here
do you think that I can actually see 8k
res 4k is pretty much the limit there's
actually an equation you can use for
that we talked about the violate the
optimal viewing distance go fossa I
invite you to watch that video because
we literally talked about the perception
of pixels from certain distances right
so at a certain PPI at a certain
distance you kind of lose the advantage
you have to get a lot closer to
distinguished pixels although people
will swear about being able to tell the
difference anyway yeah I did it's some
of it's probably a placebo effect
although I'm sure some of it people can
genuinely tell like they do test like is
this a K or is this for K you know but I
it's hard to say I mean a K is more I
think it's I don't really think there's
gonna be a practical reason to buy an
aka monitor at around 32 inches for like
for what I do at least there's no reason
for me to do that some video of special
effects artists and whatever they I'm
sure there's some use cases where
they're gonna say yeah a K is the future
I need a K but I don't see it I just
don't see the the feasibility in it I
can't tell the difference between four
and five K for an 8k I mean like 4k
already looks super crisp and far away
so depends on how close is it your
monitor to be honest like you can get
close enough to probably discern pixels
on an 8k display it depends on how baby
a K display is but yeah that was kind of
the whole thing with about 1080p TVs and
4k TVs technically not supposed to see
the difference for a lot of this
especially for a lot of the bigger was
the bigger no for a lot of the the
smaller TVs but if you get past like 60
or 65 inches I think that's where you
start to see the benefits of 4k for sure
and I can just see that when like it
toggles between 1080p and 4k and YouTube
like I didn't see the difference on my
4k TV which is like a 55 inch so around
there I would say around 60 inches
around that that that diagonal screen
size is when it starts to
matter so for it even smaller display
granted you're sitting a lot closer it's
hard to tell I'd have to run tests on my
own to verify but our cbiit says VFX is
still mostly edited in 2k which I would
I believe that I mean I have no reason
not to let's see and a lot of people
you'll find really won't I mean it's
it's it's difficult to go backwards
you're used to a 4k display then you
have to go back sorry about that back to
a 2k display at 1080p panel that's rough
it's like kind of almost equivalent to
going from 144 Hertz to 75 Hertz right
like that hurts your eyes when you're
used to the higher refresh rate it's
just like oh why is it so stuttery and
like you can tell because you've
adjusted to it your eyes do the same
with PPI but I don't think it does it to
the same extent so I've gone freely from
4k back down to 1440p at the same screen
size and I don't have any issues at all
so I just don't think people are
insensitive to it as as marketing would
have you make it out to be and I'm using
4 or 1440p panels now I've used 1080p
panels in the past from 1080 1440p I see
a difference from 1440p to 4k I do see a
difference but it's it's a smaller
distance even though there's way more
pixel there's a huge pixel jump between
1440p and 4k it's much bigger than the
pixel jump from 1080 a 1440 feet you do
the math it's very very simple to work
out but even though you're adding that
many more pixels to the 4k panel it's
still not justified in my opinion
because for one they're typically gonna
cost a lot more money for the refresh
rate that you want so if you want a 120
120 here it's 1440p panel if you're
achieving it for 200 bucks 120 Hertz 4k
panel is gonna cost you several several
hundred dollars more so you have to
weigh the pros and cons into my opinion
the cons far outweigh the pros with
respect to 4k of animals especially
gaming or they 4k panels okay let's see
yeah you scroll back up a little bit
make sure didn't miss any Super chats
but Bob I didn't miss a few of them okay
Bob Flanders donated seven
77 cents I missed you Bob I'm sorry
about that I hope you're still watching
that's my bad I've been using the the
YouTube chat and I get way behind
answering questions so that's my fault I
see it on the stream lads scream lads
menu though bob says hey Greg a long
time but I've been watching hope you and
the wife are well I appreciate that Bob
and I know that Lisa does as well
thanks for the continued support means a
lot and I a lot of you probably find
this hard to believe but I do see those
people who are always here even if you
don't throw money at me I recommend I
recommend I recognize that's the word
I'm looking for
I recognize names I do I don't do it
consciously but I do see a lot of you
who are like rippy unless they repeat
customers but you're here a lot and you
you ask questions and you comment and
and I see and I appreciate that you
don't have to be a member you don't have
to throw money at me to get that
attention but I do notice it and I
appreciate it
well let's see here scroll and we scroll
up just a little bit did I miss one more
super check I think I missed one more
yeah I missed one more from Topher tech
Topher tech what's going on dude $5
super chat hi what kind of camp would
you recommend for a beginner youtuber I
have a budget of $500 for 500 bucks I
would recommend a Panasonic g7 or a g85
I used the G 85 which was about 700
bucks at the time but it's a they're a
little cheaper now if you want to buy
them used that's what I recommend I
would trust used over you know 4 cameras
as long as the pictures look good eBay
will protect you for the most part if
you get the camera and it's trashed to
hell then you can probably get a refund
so that is that's my recommendation by
use for one and that would get you a bit
more bang for your buck I'll be able a
bit of risk but again you can typically
mitigate that with pictures and talking
to the seller and then I would stick
with Panasonic tends to offer really
competitive camera prices scenes of what
you're getting for the price so the g7
is a really good start at G 85 which has
a bit JT 5 is the one that I used and
that has like the electronic image
stabilizer mixed in with optical image
stabilization and the lens and also in
the body it's like a really good combo
so it's really smooth video I used to do
a lot from vlogging but it is
a bit more expensive than the g7 so I
would say g7 for starters and kind of
play around with the specs in that range
you get 4k xxx really crisp 4k 30 for
that price so it's a good start okay
here let's see the back go faster what's
the first math or calculus subject you
took in school a first math well if
you're talking about college
the first college course I took for math
was calculus 2 I had finished calc 1 in
high school and then I took Cal 2 in
high school but at the time I thought I
was going I was appointed to the Air
Force Academy and they make you take
everything all over again so in high
school when I found out I was appointed
I just kind of I didn't take the the end
of your exam seriously the things that
didn't affect my grade there they were
AP classes so AP stands for Advanced
Placement it's just like a college
credit course that you're offered in
high school but at the end of the year
regardless of your grade that you get in
the course you have to take a final exam
that encompasses everything in the
curriculum for that semester and if you
don't pass if you get like a you can get
a score from 1 to 5 and I think you need
a 3 to get credit in some colleges some
colleges only allow 4 or 5 which is it's
pretty tough you got to know your stuff
to get those scores and I think I got
like a 2 like I didn't even I didn't
even bother relearning everything that
we were taught earlier in the year and I
should have in hindsight because I ended
up I did up not staying at the Air Force
Academy ended up going to engineering
school so I took Cal to first I had a
professor that I still remember it was
Kendall Kendall was a really good guy
and he was a younger guy like a lot of
the professors in school were older you
know harder to relate to and they have
different methods of teaching the
younger guys tend to be more like you
know up-to-date with like the students
that they're teaching and they tend to
relate a little better and teach a
little better at least with some of
those more core classes and Kendall was
really good and he I remember the first
test I got I didn't do well my first
test score was a 51 and I mean that's
like that's not good at all like you're
not gonna be an engineer to get 50s and
60s and on like core classes right so
that was a wake-up call for me and I
jumped on YouTube actually it was one of
the reasons why I started my channel I
started watching a guy by the name of
Patrick JMT some of you might know him
if you've been taking some math courses
and maybe you want to look on YouTube
for help
Patrick explains math so well it's very
easy to understand his videos are very
clear he writes everything on paper and
then it explains all of it how it works
and even the theory behind it sometimes
and I picked my next grade up from a 51
to a 90 I think was like a 90 or 91 and
then the test after that was a 94 and he
was so impressed with the class a lot of
us in there were kind of studying
together and we were helping each other
out and he told us he said if you if you
do well in this next test which we did
that was when I got the 94 on a lot of
my classmates do the same
I got either A's or B's you guys if you
guys if the class does a lot better and
it increases the curve for this one then
I'll let you drop your lowest test grade
with the final that you'll take at the
end of the year and so we're like oh
hell you guys like most of us did
terrible in that first test and I think
a lot of us were coming out of high
school you know like this is our first
college test and in calculus and so we
were kind of we just weren't prepared we
kinda we probably thought it'd be easier
than it was and so even doing the
homework the homework really didn't
reflect the test very well because he he
tried to throw some tricks in there and
like if you don't know what you're doing
this trick still don't completely make
you miss the problem so we ended up
getting our test our first test replaced
with the final and I think I got like an
84 85 on the final so I came out of
there with a 90 I think it was like I'm
like even 90 in that class so I barely
got an A barely got it anyway yeah
sponsored by Khan Academy no I never
really watched Khan Academy I didn't lie
to Khan Academy was just the style that
just didn't work for me
I like Patrick JMT a bit more just
because he was straight to the point you
clicked on the video and it was like
immediate like here's the problem here's
how you saw that no BS not that Kahn
Academy had any BS baked into it but it
just it Patrick was better for me so I
really only watched him
serious asking about the lawsuit I
answered that a little earlier but the
see the highest math class I took in an
engineering school was we could take
differential equations which we had to
take and that we could have chosen
calculus 3 or which was obviously an
extension of Cal 2 or we could have
taken what was the other one that I took
I don't even remember I think I took
something along the lines of like an
industrial economics class I don't
remember yeah so I took Cal 1 Cal 2
differential equations you know math
classes like that I took a lot of
Statistics courses as well which that
was kind of sucked like in the moment
but I'm kind of glad I took the stats
courses because they really helped me of
what I do now so those really helped and
then when I got my MBA I had to take a
lot more of those uh Excel based classes
and that helped even more quantify data
and interpret things like that okay yeah
I'd say scrolling but Peter Jordan's
asked him when I make videos explaining
actual science I guess he missed my
video about carbon the carbon group it's
that literally answered your question I
also uploaded today a video about a
video about stellar nucleosynthesis so
there's another one for ya but you feel
kind of stupid now science is anything
that requires testing and when you have
to test something
I mean think of the scientific method
right you have a hypothesis you think
something's gonna work out this way
let's test it in an unbiased fashion to
see if my hypothesis is true run your
tests collect your data right I mean
literally going through the scientific
method right now and then you formulate
conclusions based on the data right and
even if we're not talking about
astrophysics which it seems some of you
like a few of you think that science is
only astrophysics physics astronomy
biology chemistry and that's it science
is anything that involves testing in
that to that degree and so
young maybe you maybe you learned
something there but we do a lot of it I
mean like our minute science videos for
sure have a lot of that kind of stuff
like the deep dive stuff but when we're
just benchmarking when we're running
tests when we're doing like these
experiments like that's what they are
they're experiments and if you're
experimenting that falls under the
category of science as long as you're
doing it in a way that is objective and
you're properly gathering data and
drawing conclusions again from the data
that allow you to make rational
statements about what you observed
that's science you don't have to be a
freaking rocket scientist to call
yourself scientists you can be a
scientist doing anything as long as it's
again done in that fashion or similar
fashion CQ my name is Jeff we talked
about rising 2000-series on a live chat
a while ago how have your thoughts
shifted since then I can't talk about
anything right now I said this earlier
in the livestream I can't I'm not going
to talk about rising three thousands and
two because I'm testing them currently
it wouldn't be fair
serious so the lawsuit topic hasn't made
you think twice about doing similar vids
nope I've been doing them since then
I've had like four or five craziest
videos posted since the lawsuit videos
it's not gonna stop me I did nothing
wrong I still believe that I did nothing
wrong
and a lot of you seem to think the same
way which I appreciate I appreciate the
support so ya know nothing stopped me
you can go to the I read playlist right
now and watch more videos so I do the
same things and I believe I'm within my
right to do that you know as a member of
a press media I think that some of it
falls under satirical commentary which
is protected and some of it also just is
covered under my ability to investigate
as an independent reporter so yeah their
First Amendment laws in place for those
specific cases so yeah let's see here
must the most tasteless eighty eight oh
five do you have a peel box I don't at
the moment I will have a peel box when I
move into our new house but I want to be
moving from here in a few months so when
I do that I'll get a peel box down in
Orlando and
we can set something up if you guys can
send me some weird crap and I can open
it live that would be cool I think we
should do that as like a segment of the
live streams like I'll just open up
stuff you send me I hope that I'll
probably have to have somebody screen
this stuff first to make sure I don't
get anything really weird so I'll
probably have my brother or lease or
somebody open the packages up and see or
maybe at least scan them I don't know
how we're gonna be able to Isis I never
really wanted to do stuff like that up
front because I felt like that would
just invite a bunch of weird people to
send weird stuff that's where typically
that's what happens when you do
something like that on the internet but
if people really want to take the time
today to send us something then maybe we
could set something like that up so
we'll see Oh Jeff said he wanted to oh
you wanted to wanted to give me a not so
silent nod yeah and look it's all it'll
all be revealed in a week you know
you'll find out and yeah I mean there's
no reason for you guys to be
disappointed I don't think I think
you'll be satisfied with what you see I
will say that let's see here
would you want a puppet without fiddling
I feel safe that was directed at me
thoughtful letters are okay oh of course
thoughtful letters are oh you can read
the letters that's fine yeah I know I'm
just thinking like people sending like
you know like bags with poop in a box
you know like something like that I
think people have probably thought about
doing that and I've seen people do it
online and that's like that's the kind
of stuff that I don't want to like open
myself release out too it's just like
the possibility of stuff like that
happening now that I say that probably
made it worse but I just don't you know
I'm fine with that stuff to be honest
you could email me or tweet me if you
really wanted to do that
Dale Marcel $2 stepping on Canadian I
appreciate that from Vancouver British
Columbia keep making interesting videos
I appreciate that Dale thank you I will
actually be in Vancouver specifically
for LTX next next month so actually
around this time next month so you know
if you're there or in the area and it'd
be cool to meet up you know it's gonna
be a big event this year so I'm excited
about that we talked about Elysee
exiting in the last livestream
it's gonna be really big yeah you guys
are gonna love it if you're gonna go
you're not gonna regret it
I really believe that this is gonna be
probably like my favorite event of the
year and I haven't even I haven't even
gone to one before but like there's so
much stuff they're gonna be doing with
so many partners it's it's gonna be a
big deal
trust me let's see house house is that
how you say it
$5 super shot I appreciate that
whatsoever between a gaming card and a
compute card why are so many gamers
buying radio and seven okay so yeah it
depends on them on the use case scenario
compute cards are used for different
things things that I don't really test a
lot of on this channel graphics cards
are I mean they're all graphics cards
but when we say graphics cards here
we're talking specifically about cards
that are targeted toward gamers which in
this case would be anything from a GT
1030 which please don't buy a GT 1030
all the way up to an r/t X 20 DTI which
you're pushing the upper echelon of
viability there obviously it's a $1,200
card plus but yeah it depends on the use
case so you get by like a lot of the
Quadro cards which are still like
they're almost the exact same cards as
some mainstream consumer cards for
gaming but they're targeted for
different things maybe they have
different display outs maybe they have
no display outs at all some of those
compute cards don't need to splay out so
yeah it definitely depends on the use
case
radon 7 is really not it's it's not a
card that I would recommend a lot of
people buy because of that because if I
was buying radon 7 I would have a very
specific use case for it and most of
what I do wouldn't require that so it's
yeah we'll see I mean now he's gonna
change that I will say that and I have
two Navi cards here so you'll also find
out about that soon and in terms of
competitiveness in the upper echelon of
cards okay but the scrolling down
someone said viewers a gimmick and
expensive I highly disagree VR is cheap
you can give VR for 300 bucks and it's
and it's a game changer for gaming it's
the future of gaming I believe but let's
see here
oh it's crystals in here see I see if
someone takes crystalline tag crystal
there you go okay uh yeah chris says
QuakeCon amber we talked about this
Chris he says QuakeCon LTX are at the
same time this year looks like I chose
event support Gigi Gigi I mean yeah i
i'm pretty sure as well there's some
other events they're coming up kind of
around LTX and it's kind of funny like
one of them was like I don't know if I
can say anything about the company
involved but it was a kind of like a
keynote type thing for a launch coming
up and they wanted to know if we could
if they could fly us out to California
around like the 23rd of July and I'm
like well I was like LTX is coming up
and I've already committed to that like
you've already got flights and
everything arranged so that's a for sure
gonna happen so I you know I hadn't you
need to be scheduled around LTX
basically and so it's it's kind of funny
to see like the the amount of influence
that Linus and lmg have it's it's insane
and you started to see it kind of play
out and in these events that they're
putting together like these events are
gonna be so big like LTX this year is
going to be so much bigger than LTX with
last year just judging from all the crap
that they've got going on that they're
planning this year it's just it's
difficult for companies to compete for
press right so they kind of have to work
around Linus's schedule which is like
the ultimate power play like that's got
to be such a cool feeling so you know to
have like a big enough party tour
everyone else that you used to you know
work with has to kind of bend to your
will
that's just such a cool I don't know
anyway side note but ya know be pretty
dope let's see let's see Greg make a
super computer custom loop to tour a
super computer custom to time I'm not
sure that would be feasible I don't know
what you mean by supercomputer but it's
what I think you mean I probably
wouldn't be feasible let's see yeah best
bang for the buck is rx 574 125 used
yeah
talking use market rx 570 is really you
I didn't get some of those for 100 bucks
if you want I know I picked up a couple
RX 5 80s for just over 100 bucks a few
months ago prices change obviously but
that was a really good card for the
price I actually bought like four of
those and 10 70s are really good you can
get 10 70s you used to be able to get 10
seventies for like 200 bucks to me those
were the best value graphics cards in
the used market now it's difficult to
find them because Pascal inventories
dried up in the new market so now people
are saying oh well if you want Pasco you
want my car then you got to pay a little
more for because you can't buy it new
anymore it's supply-demand it's it's
like simple economics and they they're
taking advantage of it and they're
selling them apparently so the prices
are right the market dictates prices so
yeah anyway you guys have been awesome I
