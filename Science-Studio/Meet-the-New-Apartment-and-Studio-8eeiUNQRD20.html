new place now this is my own apartment I
finally moved into my own place it's
pretty dirty still in this room most of
the stuff that needs to be put in
storage has been put in storage so all
the stuff you're seeing in here just
stuff that I haven't gotten to yet
couple rising process there's a bunch of
coolers there's motherboard boxes good
good to have water cooling gear up there
to build Walter White and then that's
just like a random gaming test bench
build got a couple monitors down here
we're gonna take a tour of the rest of
the place just wanted to give you kind
of a sneak peek of what the the
basically editing and gaming room will
look like once it's all said and done
we're gonna have a desk running all the
way along this wall and then another
desk running along this wall so it'd
look pretty cool to have two things
going on in the same room now on to the
film room don't worry about this this is
just a box-spring for my bed that's
coming in soon so I don't have the bed
furniture yet but some of the stuff in
the kitchen living room has been set up
now this is pretty much just a storage
closet because I don't know what else to
do with it right now but the good thing
about this place is that there is plenty
of storage space available which is nice
for a tech to wear because we have a
knack for collecting boxes there's one
bathroom in there that is not furnished
this is a washer/dryer set up here and
kind of a closet in the hallway this is
a rat's nest of coax cables the cool
thing I didn't know about this
beforehand every room basically has been
pre-wired for land and coax so you'll
see there's a coax port over here so we
have coax which runs into the modem and
then from the modem - I just have a
Google hub Google Wi-Fi router there but
there's also an Ethernet port underneath
the coaxial if you can see it but that
Ethernet port is not wired we're gonna
work on wiring that soon and there's one
of these in every single room so it's
really cool to have all that pre done
for you especially in an apartment not
you know a house so they've already
dropped all the wires through the walls
this is just kind of master bathroom
here there's a door leading into the
bathroom to the bedroom excuse me but
there's also a door here leading into
the butt
so I don't know why they bother doing
that this is where the bed will go some
dressers nightstands this is just a
closet for clothing storage and whatnot
you know in general bedroom closet this
room looks pretty big now but I
guarantee it's gonna look much smaller
when all the furniture is in here now on
to the dining room so the dining room
was not furnished at all nothing
actually was furnished in this apartment
so I had to buy this set here this was
actually not too bad about 400 bucks or
so you can see we have all stainless
steel appliances and these are all
included that's about the only thing
that was included with the apartment
apart from you know separate utilities
this is the living room it's kind of
conjoined which is cool get that nice
open concept the walls the ceiling is
actually or vaulted so that's very nice
it makes it feel much bigger than it
actually is and then we have a couch
that I've been sleeping on because yeah
I don't have a bed yet so kind of what
we had to make do with also check out
this lava lamp I mean what 23 year old
doesn't want a lava lamp in his or her
apartment come on
so yeah looks pretty sweet now the last
thing I wanted to show you this is
actually a second-story apartment but
there is a staircase it's my own
staircase and it goes all the way down
to the base floor so that's pretty cool
I get my own front door on the first
floor there's a little Closet in there
for storing shoes and jackets and then
you walk up the stairs to the main event
now obviously we still have a lot of
furniture to buy I still got to buy the
two desks or maybe I'll build the two
desks and kind of run them along the
walls here turn this into it's super
dope filming an editing room and then we
will also have our dedicated filming
studio in the next room which is
actually supposed to be a bedroom they
way my set up a green screen
teleprompter make it super official
thanks for bearing with me that's why I
haven't been uploading videos lately
because I've been busy moving into this
new place it's pretty big considering on
the only one living here so we're gonna
make as much use of it as we can for the
channel this is sign studio thanks for
touring with us
