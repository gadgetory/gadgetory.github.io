overclocked beast with a hefty price tag
it's going on sale October 17th that's
tomorrow from today's filming for around
850 a US dollars that's right so we
compare this garden tour 1080 Ti I want
you to keep that in mind
1080 eyes are selling for between 7 and
800 USD in the new market making them
slightly cheaper than their r-tx
counterparts with minimal performance
losses but again we're talking about
Pascal and not touring but we all know
what was going on with Nvidia in my past
videos I think that they're playing on a
future of ray tracing and hoping devs
catch on sooner rather than later but if
you're considering our KX 2080 for the
time being this one from Asus is the one
you should strongly consider and here's
why I've made my propensity to resist RT
x anything but a secret these last
couple of months I do think this card is
overpriced I do think the used market
holds true value at the moment and I do
believe a huge chunk of this card's
architectural features will go unused
for several months if not years again it
all comes down to the games you play and
the settings you enable but let's assume
for the intent of this video that you're
sold on this generation of cards why is
this one of the top contenders well I
put it through the ringer
several torture workloads and coding
scenarios and games in 1440p and 4k
buying this card for 1080p by the way
makes absolutely no sense at all i'm
referring to gaming it won't be tested
in this video so don't expect to see it
in fact our CPU often becomes the
bottleneck at this resolution so it make
no sense to test it in this resolution
anyway starting with this card's design
I think it's one of the sexiest on the
market it stays true to the original
Strix form but with added Flair and
subtle improvements basically everywhere
for starters it sports a beefier cooler
no doubt to accompany the roughly 225
watt TDP card we'll talk about power
draw later and oddly enough despite
having a lower value than a 1080 Ti and
video recommends a beefier power supply
for its Turing lineup this may be
attributed more or less to sharper
fluctuations and clock speed under load
this card does overclock just a bit and
we'll get to that soon as well other
physical qualities I'm enjoying here the
black now back plate that's a nice touch
you'll find two HDMI ports to display
ports and a USB type-c port for
virtually support and VR that will
become the standard I expect very soon I
find it strange ledee soos decided to
strip its card of the third DisplayPort
connection that's something the FE model
does have so if you were hoping to link
up three DisplayPort monitors discreetly
you'll need to look elsewhere that's
kind of a letdown
these HDMI ports however are USB 2.0 be
compatible meaning that you could run
1440p at a high refresh rate assuming
your monitor supports a connection as
well via the same interface which
honestly is a rare find all this to say
it's typically much easier just to deal
with display ports because you know that
your resolution and refresh rate are
more than likely going to be supported
which is why this is such a bummer to
see the shroud of the Strix 2080 is
plastic inline with LEDs throughout
these can be changed with aces or a
software and/or a via dedicated on/off
switch built straight into the top of
the card this is convenient for those
uninterested in dealing with RGB x' at
all and I like the the subtle touch
they're a large geforce r-tx logo spans
the side of the card along with smaller
Strix and rog logos the latter of which
is LED illuminated to sync with the
remainder of the lighting scheme also on
this side are two eight pin supplemental
power connectors something we'll be sure
to test in this video we'll grab power
draw from these wires assuming a
saturated PCI slot and take note of node
temps as well just in case you were
interested in just a little more detail
there by the way a nifty addition is a
BIOS toggle dead center P mode stands
for performance and does exactly what it
says while Q mode keeps things nice and
quiet at the expense of clocks or so the
claim is so we'll be able to customize
this further of a GPU tweak tools and
whatnot but I do want to test that in
this video lastly on this side is the
envy link setup if you were wanting to
tag-team two of these cards which would
cost you upwards of $2000 that's beside
the point
now the backplate is a metal and purely
an aesthetic play it carries no thermal
properties since no thermal pads align
the space between it and the custom PCB
underneath it's always a nice added
touch that I like to look for in cards
of this caliber but I don't see that
here I am glad that the backplate does
exist though and I'm glad
the ROG logo lights up again it is
better synced by the way with the
remainder of the cards lighting scheme
so it won't say look blue when the LEDs
elsewhere up here are white and so
something I noticed with my Strix 1070 I
do want to bring up the nickel plated
copper cooler one more time before
diving into the benchmarks it's
definitely been upgraded over the
previous gen stuff and as a result is
slightly thicker than before and because
stirring doesn't run to much hotter than
Pascal in general that means this card's
gonna run extra cool under load now much
like it's 20 atti sibling this one
ridges and deep into the third PCI slot
meaning things will be cramped if you
decide to stash two of these in a system
with a single slot between this by the
way it's what you'd have to do if you
intend on saturating both 16 Lane slots
on some motherboards in fact most of
them have that single slot in between
you know two slot thick cards just
something to keep in mind by the way
just above the coolers are these cool
fans three of them with blades connected
to their circular chassis we'll see how
this helps or hurts the Kart and we run
our sound test so starting with gaming
performance you'll find between three
and five different benchmark scenarios
in the upcoming graphs I've got my
trusty EVGA GTX 1080 I bought for 300
bucks just as the value proposition in
today's video
a gtx 1080i gaming overclocked sent from
gigabyte and three different passes with
this card right here depending on the
scenario I ran a couple of tests with
quiet mode enabled instead of
performance mode just to pick up on the
margin and I also played around with
manual overclocking for the highest
stable frequencies I could obtain those
were a 2000 70 megahertz at poor and 70
700 megahertz on the memory this card
was very difficult to overclock past its
out-of-the-box frequencies which are
already considerably higher than its
founders Edition counterparts so out of
the box was about 1950 and then 7000
megahertz on memory so very good to be
honest and that means that if you don't
feel like manually overclocking you're
not gonna lose much in terms of
performance these are the set ups and
other components used it's the same as
always feel free to pause we want to
look at this in more detail otherwise
here we can go now something else to
keep in mind while analyzing these
results is that this is by no means an
apples to apples comparison between a
twenty eighty and a ten atti
obviously the gtx 1080 just plain old
1080
is at a disadvantage all around but in
the real world we'd expect a typical
1080p eye to keep up with a typical 2080
now ever since the gigabyte card we're
using here isn't particularly beefy or
enthusiasts great I would say the gap is
slightly larger than what you might have
seen from other reviewers typically
these cards will trade blows I did
manually overclock the gigabyte card
just a bit more than stock to make up
for some of this difference but both
power and thermal imitations prevented
me from getting very far starting first
with the superposition benchmark we see
a solid lead for our Strix 2080 when
manually overclocked though it oddly
falls behind our 1080 Ti under stock
conditions in fact our 1080 SC isn't
even far behind these 2080 results this
is likely attributed to external
optimization factors because this
doesn't actually replicate itself in
other tests another thing we notice here
is that the difference between quiet and
performance profiles is entirely
negligible when seen in the context of
short gaming spurts in fact throughout
my testing the two profiles were nearly
indistinguishable which is why I stuck
to the performance setting for the
duration of these tests is just a
validation of sorts we'll discuss
audible differences shortly so stay
tuned for that now 3d mark time spy
reveals a more expected result our 2018
edges out a victory under stock
conditions and blows away its
competition when manually overclocked
past 2000 megahertz the extreme version
of this benchmark which you're seeing
here is a 4k synthetic just FYI
up next is GTA 5 and 1440p and virtually
max settings save anti-aliasing 20/80
takes the cake with an average frame
rate of 139 dropping to 91 among the
lowest 1% of frames recorded the 1080 Ti
mind you wasn't far behind only four
frames on average which is arguably
within the margin of error at these high
frame rates another important note the
gap between these contenders and the
1080 is quite wide so a noticeable jump
there and 4k reveals a similar story the
2080 and 1080 TI trade blows near 90 FPS
while the 1080 struggles to keep things
above 60 this is for K maxed after all
so it actually isn't too bad when seen
in the context of a $300 graphics card
now our SAS ins Creed Odyssey is up next
and this thing cost me 60 bucks and all
I'll ever probably do with it is
benchmark so you better believe I threw
it in this video
the
18:10 atti achieved 64 and 62 FPS on
average respectively while attend 80
edges out just under 48 1% lowest fall
in line with around 45 FPS for a to more
powerful cards in 4k things become very
difficult though I couldn't even hit
60fps on average with either card in the
ultra preset and the 1080 rendered a
scene that was practically unplayable
this thing crushes GPUs and frame
buffers F 1 2017 was a bit of a relief
between our heaviest benchmarks the 2080
clearly wins across the board here and
the 1080 closes the lead surprisingly in
4k this game is playable in both
resolutions with all cards in this ultra
preset shadow of the Tomb Raider was a
tough one for all in question I promised
I would include this one instead of rise
of the Tomb Raider from now on
barely 70 FPS in 1440p just over 45 and
4k this game was unplayable in the 4k
ultra preset with a 1080 though we
shouldn't be surprised by this one thing
I did notice was a slightly higher 1%
low average in the 4k resolution for the
1080 Ti at 32 fps this card edged out a
narrow win with respect to stuttering
and lower frame rate scenarios
perhaps a testament to the current state
of drivers for turing cards lastly we
looked at pub G for a bit of fun in the
sand hawk map in 1440p I was pleasantly
surprised 133 FPS is no laughing matter
despite the inconsistent stuttering
associated with poor optimisation
standards these results across the board
are to be expected nothing out of the
ordinary to report on here now with
respect to power draw under load
conditions I do want you to remember
that this is a custom PCB designed for
higher power tolerances not that you'll
be able to push things past about 125
percent or so that's respect to the
power limit imposed by Nvidia themselves
this card when fully maxed out we'll
pull approximately 310 watts from the
wall assuming a fully soaked PCIe slot
using a clamp meter on the hot lines
running through the dual 8 pins and
adding 75 watts to account for PCIe draw
we're just breaking 300 watts which puts
us somewhere in the realm of 30%
additional power consumption for this
particular model over the FE model
running a stock config out of the box
bumps this figure down to approximately
285 watts with the same assumption which
should place most gamers in a
comfortable spot with a 6 to 700 watt
power supply though I should note that a
Singh
GPU CPU config in the consumer space at
least should still be perfectly fine
with something as low as a 500 watt
power supply if absolutely necessary all
in all these are the results we should
expect from AI be partners with BV
custom implementations they always
consume more power than their founded
editions or reference standards and this
card is certainly no exception though I
think that the pros outweigh the cons in
this case a few additional comments I'd
like to make for starters the Asus Strix
2080 I tested had little to no coil
whine which was a nice change from the
gigabyte 1080 Ti that coil one on that
card was louder than the fans themselves
under load oh my gosh and I'm being
serious here just a bit excessive
another thing that struck me with the
Asus card was how quiet it was under
load even in the performance BIOS preset
I could hear the CPU cooler more than I
could the fans on the graphics card
under load and that's saying a lot
because the dark ROC TF i was using from
be quiet is in fact very quiet already
temperatures under load and made
performance config barely scraped 66
degrees Celsius in our unit in heaven
loop and with the manual overclock to
roughly 2070 megahertz that number of
jumped by a mere four degrees to 70 C
under load needless to say we had plenty
of headroom left over as a testament to
both how beefy this cooler is and how
efficient the custom PCB is it's just a
shame that we couldn't push things
higher from voltage stand points or just
from from power limits stand points
because this car has so much more
potential when it's being locked by the
bios and by Nvidia so this card really
is just it's a card that you're gonna
buy more or less for being quiet than
for being an excellent overclocker
because you'll run into other
limitations apart from just thermal
limitations because this court has way
more headroom than it actually needs
given the constraints and NVIDIA puts on
it by the way and I entered this earlier
if you aren't as interested in manual
overclocked switch make anywhere between
a four and eight percent difference on
paper you'll be better off in the quiet
BIOS config frame rates go virtually
unchanged in situations where airflow is
ample and the card stays ultra quiet in
the process the quiet mode just forces
this card to keep the fans a little
quieter which means that when things get
a little hotter the card's gonna you
know down clock the the
and here's dynamic it has been since
Pascal you next what does it so when the
card gets pretty hot then the clock
speed that the core will actually drop a
little bit to compensate but because
this cooler is so beefy up front and
there's really no thermal limitation
associated with this card so it's never
gonna hit a point at which the clock
speeds need to drop significantly and
that's why I don't think there's really
even a point to have a quiet versus
performance bios switch on this card
because that's not the issue at all here
speaking of which when manually
overclock the asus strix 2080 didn't
exceed forty six decibels in our testing
placing it just below our EVGA 1070 TI
which is a triple slot card and is also
overclocked this is one of the quietest
cards i've ever tested believe it or not
and without a screeching coil whine will
run under the radar in most rigs with a
decent airflow metrics so I'm willing to
conclude with my hands tied that this is
one of the best r-tx 2080s on the market
both in terms of performance and audible
metrics it crushes games and even the 4k
resolution and you saw here how we
basically maxed out all in game settings
so cutting back on these just a bit
should yield at least 60 FPS and nearly
all triple-a titles today in that
resolution but the elephant in the room
is of course the price this thing is not
cheap it's actually about $200 more
expensive than the gtx 980ti compared
this to in this video meaning from a
strictly frame per dollar perspective
the r-tx 2080 is a much worse value and
there's no other way to put it the way I
see it the only reason why you should
buy this card is if you plan the game at
4k but can't afford a 20 atti and if
price is that big of a concern to you
compromising on a 1080p eye instead
should still get the job done I'm in a
predicament here because I absolutely
love this card I just hate the prices at
which these things are launched and look
if this thing was selling for around 700
bucks I'd be all over and I would never
recommend a 1080 TI again and in my
opinion that's where the price of this
card should be I think it should be
around 700 to 750 bucks but NVIDIA has
other plans and that includes
liquidating its ex as Pascal inventory
so if you want to save money you got to
buy the older gender kind of forcing
your hands here it's still perfectly
viable in 2018 but not the newest and
that's a problem for some people they
gotta have the newest and greatest and
they'll be sure
pay for it so look if you're gonna get
an RT X 2080 if you're absolutely set on
the 2080 and nothing can change your
mind
look here by this one no one's paying me
to say this and I have a few other 2082
laying around so nothing special - how
is treated here by a soos I just think
it's the best one of the bunch it's the
best looking the best performing and
ouch the most expensive I suppose you
get what you pay for but touring is just
expensive all around and I'll always
circle back to that so I suppose we
should stop here because like this video
