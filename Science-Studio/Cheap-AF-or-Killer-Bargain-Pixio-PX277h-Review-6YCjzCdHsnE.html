always hunt with a fair bit of
skepticism it's healthy to doubt the
good in things because not everything is
as good as it seems it tells me to
question the viability of what may
appear on paper to be a good deal often
deals that seem too good to be true or
in fact to it to be true this shouldn't
be news to many of you these products
often come with hidden compromises
undisclosed by the manufacturer in the
case of monitors which is a topic of
this video it's easy to hype panels and
Photoshop things like bezels and colors
we see this all the time and that's why
monitor reviews are so important that's
why I'm reviewing the pic Co P X - 7 7 H
today because it does seem a little too
good to be true can someone explain to
me how a company you've probably never
heard of manages to pack a 1440p IPS 144
Hertz
HDR capable monitor behind a price tag
of just $400 skepticism intensifies and
to be fair I've reviewed one other pic
Co monitor in the past the colors were
actually pretty great and the high
refresh rate was awesome for gaming it
was actually my first 144 Hertz display
and from there I purchased my ACS PG - 7
9 q a 165 Hertz 1440 PT and panel with
g-sync I still use it by the way with my
personal gaming rig it's right here but
the PX 277 H is a true value proposition
in my opinion it's the perfect gaming
form factor 27 inches isn't too big for
most first-person shooters and isn't too
small for those sitting around 2 feet
away I struggle to discern pixels and
enjoy the high refresh rate build
quality is satisfactory and the panel
itself is actually quite slim though
much of that is due to the external AC
adapter you'll have to deal with
personally I prefer these tucked behind
the display like integrated into the
monitor I don't like blocks kind of
hanging from my cables behind my desk so
I'm not too concerned with panel
thickness in today's day and age but
that of course will vary depending on
the user now the stand is pretty
mediocre allowing for only a vertical
tilt up or down you can't raise a
display and you can't tilt it left or
right though I should note the base of
mounting is supported so if you have an
aftermarket mount you know aftermarket
stand for your monitor then you might
want to ditch the stock one included
with this panel the stock stand though
does include a cable routing hole just a
small touch but it goes a long way the
ugly red pick Co logo from the
model I reviewed has been moved to the
back thank God and black gloss has been
replaced with a matte plastic the on
screen display is actually fairly
intuitive and the buttons are located on
the bottom right side of the frame as
usual from here you can find everything
from sharpness to color balance this is
also where you can select your preferred
input method in general it's a pretty
healthy menu in the box you'll find the
stand a three screws and a small
Phillips head screwdriver so no external
tools required assembly takes just a
couple of minutes and the thin panel
makes it light and easy to set up the
included HDMI cable is a cat 2 cable and
one of the three video ports under the
hood is HDMI 2.0 capable meaning you
could actually run up to 144 Hertz 1440p
from this monitor with that 2.0 HDMI
port there's only one of them though the
other one is a four 1.44 excuse me
so once 2.0 one's 1.4 and the 1.4 won't
support 144 Hertz 1440p just keep that
in mind no there's only one that'll work
for if you're wondering why the included
cable isn't outputting 1440p 144 it's
it's probably because you have it
plugged into the wrong HDMI port you may
also choose to connect via DisplayPort
1.2 though such a cable is not included
in the Box color reproduction is
satisfactory the fibrin see is amplified
by this panels brightness which we'll
get to in a second but 100% srgb isn't
advertised anywhere in the Box it does
support HDR 10 however which allows the
display to replicate slightly deeper
blacks a little more color vibrancy
among other things viewing HDR content
in general is not a common occurrence
yet and I'm not completely sold on the
idea of paying extra for the vibrancy
nonetheless if it's something you're
into or looking for it's supported in
this monitor what I will say with
respect to colors themselves is that
things look very similar to my bank u2 7
7 0 qz panel which I reviewed right here
speaking of ridiculous names and which
boasts a 100% srgb color gamut a clear
step up from TN so if you're deciding
between TN and IPS and you care about
color reproduction all heavily you know
if it's something that's very important
in your list then don't go with a TN
panel consider the pic Co or something
similar but in the realm of gaming how
well does the px 2 7 7 H fare well about
as good as you might expect for 400
bucks maybe just a bit better than that
it comes equipped with the second
iteration of AMD's free sync so if you
have an AMD graphics card it's
relatively modern y'all
up and smoothness although this isn't
something that I expect many people will
immediately notice especially when
you're you know playing at a high
refresh rate if you're pushing those
frames to your monitor let's say you're
around 120 FPS then AMD freesync will
kick in but it's not gonna be as
noticeable as if you were playing around
the 40 60 FPS mark you can still by the
way run Nvidia graphics cards in the
native refresh rate and forego the
dedicated sync technology just in case
you're wondering you just can't use free
sync when you're using it in GPU now
assuming you've got a CPU capable of
maintaining a frame rate well above 100
FPS you aren't likely to notice any
serious stuttering and tearing and
that's a good thing I also want to bring
up the IPS technology implemented here
it does play a significant role in those
great colors as you mentioned earlier
but it also aids in the viewing angle
Department so if you care about viewing
angles off center than IPS is definitely
technology want not something like TN we
discuss IPS technology in great detail
right here but it's mixed with something
else known as a hva or advanced hyper
viewing angle technology which I haven't
heard of until now to be honest not to
be confused with VA panels you'll find
up to 178 degrees of viewing goodness
with this panel and no expensive color
reproduction not sure why you'd want to
sit this far off-center but you get the
point and brightness is actually
enhanced ever so slightly thanks to the
a hva inclusion so all in all it's
actually an excellent panel for gaming
with a modest PPI so for a price tag of
roughly $400 I actually think the pixel
panels got the right stuff there are
certainly cost-saving measures to
consider and there are trade-offs with
the IPS technology but I would go for
this if I care about colors I mean hands
down nothing in this price range today
will be perfect but the px 2 7 7 H keeps
the important attributes in check an IPS
panels in the 144 Hertz 1440p category
are usually around six $700 good ones
and this panel is actually pretty good
so for 400 bucks I think you're getting
a steal you can find links down below to
this panel and a few others I use on a
daily basis including this Asus monitor
behind me and the ultra wide in the film
room if you're interested and I now show
that from what I've seen that the panel
from pick CEO is definitely worth
considering it's called the px 2 7 7 H
and again it is linked down below I
think it's one of the best bang for the
buck 1440p 144 it's IPS panels on the
market in fact you'd be hard-pressed to
find something with that you know lineup
of specs including HDR 10 which i've
pay more for but other people might in a
$400 price range that to me is
incredible I didn't have any dead pixels
or anything like that but you know if
you have a severe issue with the screen
or even a moderate one pretty sure you
can return and get your money back if
pic Co doesn't do it then you might be
able to get fulfilled via Amazon so I
recommend purchasing it from Amazon
because their customer service policies
are pretty you know pretty good for what
they are if you have a problem with the
distributor the manufacturer you can go
directly via Amazon with your claim and
you usually come out on top people are a
little skeptical with panels like this
from companies they never heard of and I
understand that and that's why again I
recommend buying through Amazon and not
doing it through some like third-party
retailer website where you might not
have any customer service at all thumbs
up if you liked the video or dislike it

you hate everything about life you can
