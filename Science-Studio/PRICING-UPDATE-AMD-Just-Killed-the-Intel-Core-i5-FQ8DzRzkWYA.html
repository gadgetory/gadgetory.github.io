go ahead and say my good-byes now no no
no no cuz that in my shoulder don't do
that to the chair I should out oh this
poor chair everybody meet Pepsi Pepsi
meet everybody okay the introduction is
over time to start filming cuz she's not
gonna be too excited in about a minute
before you scream clickbait allow me to
explain up front
I am DS value proposition has been a hot
topic for US tech tubers for quite a
while now the question regarding the
choice between the i7 8700 K typically
hailed as the gaming king and the r7
1700 or second gen 2700 X true
multi-core ball buster CPUs seems to
always spark debate and rightfully so I
mean both have their advantages and I
have to give conditions when asked to
recommend one or the other for
workstations virtual machines and
streaming you can't go wrong with a 1700
the second gen rise and stuff is just
gravy but for pure gaming and niche
video work in premiere for example the
8700 K reigned supreme Intel's lowly and
ring bus Trump's the competition that's
the Infinity fabric on AMD side and nigp
means additional software encoding
support but the introduction of horizon
and 2017 placed Intel's Core i5 into
questionable territory look KB Lake and
older Union structured around really
four cores are just a bit dated in 2018
they were still better gamers overall
they still are if that's all you want to
do is just game but fewer and fewer
people are literally doing just that
with the rise of twitch and other
streaming services growing in popularity
so people are doing more than one thing
at the same time and that makes sense
the core race is strong the marketing
punch is stronger and that's exactly why
Intel bumped its core i5 count for
coffee Lakes launch now the 80 480 600k
consumer grade i5 CPUs boast 6 cores
still no hyper-threading gaming
performance is still some of the best in
the business but we consistently see
comparable rise in cpus both in terms of
price and core account crushing the blue
team and heavy multitasking workloads
and that's where the title of this video
comes into play see one of our sponsors
and patreon supporters at T Baum pointed
out that the first gen rise in seven
CPUs most notably these 1,700 was priced
at 100
9 USD that is nearly half the MSRP of
the chip at launch and it's something I
think you should strongly consider for
your next PC build now as of the
publishing date of this video actually
when I'm filming this the deal no longer
exists it was still running yesterday
but I've linked the CPU and a few
motherboards and RAM kits down below in
the video description and I invite you
to check those prices on a daily basis
if not weekly because I'm pretty sure
we'll see similar pricing and then your
future it just makes sense they've done
it once before they'll do it as the chip
continues to get older I'm only asking
you to consider it and to look at this
deal for what it truly is an eight-core
16 thread CPU capable of at least 3.8
gigahertz under modest conditions that's
with a be 350 motherboard which is very
cheap by the way it's priced at
entry-level core i5 territory now in
games it isn't the best I've run several
tests in the past with various graphics
cards to verify this but I'd like you to
overlook the small FPS Delta's this is
not about the better performer it's
about the better of value if we break
these benchmark systems down on an FPS
per dollar basis for a game like GTA 5
the money saved on a cheaper higher core
account CPU and B 315 motherboard
results in comparable overall value per
frame extracted this mind you ignores
the streaming and multitasking benefits
of such machine over at SCI 5
counterpart despite Intel's Core jump
from 4 to 6 this time around so the
point of this video isn't to make a sale
or to earn a few bucks on affiliate
Commission's I mean the C if he is not
even priced at 100 G's of AMD they've
turned quite sassy recently mocking
Intel's 8086 k giveaway and undercutting
much of the competition's pricing
structure I mean the r7 1700 isn't even
AMD's latest generation CPU the second
gen 2700 is still selling in the States
for almost 300 bucks still a heck of a
bargain when seen in the context at Z
370 and unlock i7 prices mind you but
that's for a separate video look if you
want the best in gaming go for the i7 if
you want Intel's architecture for
optimized programs go for the i7 I'm not
gonna try to steer you away from Intel
if you were already going after it for
those specific reasons but if you want
pure value it's almost impossible to
overlook and not consider a brand new
rise in 7/8 core 16 thread CPU priced
under $200 be vigilant check Amazon
every day for these deals and jump on
the one you feel best suits your next
build whether it be with the red team or
the
I don't care I don't get paid by either
of them either way how do I look at this
pricing strategy though I think AMD
wants the i-5 dead I think they'd openly
admit that if they're willing to price
of 1,700 at $1.99 then they'll surely do
it again and bundling with an affordable
B through 50 board will yield some of
the best value in the business this
isn't about picking a side it's about
being a rational being reasonable using
your brain and when it comes to value 8
core 16 threads at 199 is just in my
eyes it's almost impossible to pass up
if I was building another workstation PC
something I needed a lot of course for
and I was conscious about my budget now
maybe I want to spend a thousand bucks
$1,500 then the rise in 717 hundred at
$1.99 is it's just staring you right in
the face and begging to be bought and I
think that I would have no problem
buying that CPU over the i7 8700 K
merely from a value proposition I don't
know you guys think the comments below
let me know give this video a thumbs up
if you thought it was cool thumbs down
for the obstacle if that red subscribe
button if you haven't already in stay
