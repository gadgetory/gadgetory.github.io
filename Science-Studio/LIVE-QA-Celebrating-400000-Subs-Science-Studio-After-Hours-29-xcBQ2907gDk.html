curious about whether or not I'm
actually live or not let's see here I'll
be patient I'll wait to make sure so
don't waste my time talking to nobody
just talking into the ether here did it
see no latency - I didn't opt for the
low latency stream this time around
because I heard that that kind of
affects the quality of the live stream
itself still not seeing it live again
you guys gonna be watching this live if
it actually is live so I apologize for
the weird delay hmm still not seeing it
awkward awkward there it is alright here
we go sorry I just want to make sure so
there's like 20 seconds there of me just
talking to myself
so we're live and this is our 29th
official half-doors livestream if I
sound awkward if I sound too loud too
soft either turned me up or turned me
down or asked me to turn myself up or
down I'm pretty sure I'm good though I'm
not peeking I'm in the I'm in the
comfortable Goldilocks zone when it
comes to audio at least that's what it
showed me on screen so we will see right
now I am streaming out of the offices
where I normally stream but I have the
camera tilted slightly to the left from
your position I couldn't use for some
reason I have the mic wired directly
into the camera it's how I usually film
that audio is really good I think the
cameras preamps are awesome no but I
couldn't get audio to feed through the
camera through to the capture card - to
the live stream so i you know what no
matter what I did in OBS I couldn't get
that to work so I had to use the sound
board and just hooked up the b1 good old
behringer b1 mic here this thing is a B
section we got this from lights music
lights music is a kind of a local music
store franchise here in Panama City and
we we actually we used to buy guitars
from them wiebe my dad my dad bought
guitar
because that was I used to play guitar
all the time I still kind of do and he
used to buy him from from lights all the
time so lights would cut him cool deals
because he was a repeat customer and
stuff so I showed up to the to the beach
office I think man must have been a year
ago it's weird to think it was that long
ago and I was like hey I need a couple
mics and mic stands and stuff for some
live streams and everything one of the
guys actually knew me from from YouTube
which I thought was really cool and he
didn't know me from like the fact that I
just lived in town he just knew me from
YouTube even though I lived down the
street literally it was kind of funny
but he hooked us up too with be ones for
90 bucks sitting ninety or ninety $99 or
something like that it's still a great
deal for for a mic like this is just a
beautiful condenser microphone I'm got
shock mounts I got the newer or new
we're forget which way it goes
mic arm and you can kind of see see the
mic arm in the camera there and then we
have another one further back I took
that one off because Lisa used to use it
but we're going to come up with
something different for her because her
desk doesn't have the basically the
desktop doesn't over hang the rails far
enough to latch the mic arm onto it cuz
it's kind of like a C grip like a vice
so I'm not sure we're gonna do with her
maybe we'll get her like a really nice
headset with a really good microphone
and just let her do it that way or stick
to something like wall-mounted I'm not
sure anyway folks I see you guys in the
chat and I know you are just Megan to
ask those questions so we're gonna move
on over to you all this is this is
ultimately for you guys and hopefully
hopefully I can get through you know
most of your questions
you guys always that's good stuff and I
honestly if you guys stumped me with
something like I've never heard of
before or maybe I don't know enough
about it to answer the question fully
that's good I like that that's that's
the point of this ultimately is is for
us all to learn and if I can learn the
process too then everyone you know is
better off in the end
so anyway let's see here
actually carnufex summing it to the
super chat real quick asks why haven't
you made any linux videos and that's
because i
it seems like someone always asks this
in every livestream the reason why I do
not like Linux as just a you know a
casual user
I don't like Linux just in general
because the UI is a little choppy I have
used Linux on Chromebooks before I just
I kind of packed to the Chromebook and
just flash Linux on to it I was using
Ubuntu I think it's what I used if I
must pronounce that I'm a noob I'm sorry
but that was the thing that I flashed on
to the on to the Chromebook because I
hated Chrome OS at the time and my
experience with Linux is pretty much
limited in scope to that and I wasn't
the fondest of the you I thought it was
a little too complicated I just yeah
just didn't really like it um honestly
look at will wolf will says trash pit
right what is this only 50 mega you can
do at least 9001 we'll get over here
okay first off you guys know we'll all
right but will I see Brian's yeah
Brian Tech you see Brian's like happy
birthday girl thank you for that Brian
you're you're a little late but I'm not
gonna take it personally but thesis
Congrats on forty thousand subs thank
you for uh for that Congrats I think
we're a little higher than forty
thousand but nonetheless thanks for
stopping by Brian you guys know that
Brian and I shared discord you can check
out the link down below it is free to
join of course by the way if the camera
is popping in and out of focus because
I'm not staring directly into the camera
all the time let me know and I'll lock
the autofocus but it should be it should
be for the most part sticking to my face
I don't know I'll talk to Sony about
this if not so that's that's why I
haven't used a Linux just because I
don't like the UI frankly that's really
the extent of it I don't like the the
coding aspect of it I don't like having
to type in commands to do what I want to
do I just want to click on something and
just do it I grew up with windows and
that's kind of just something I've I've
taken for granted so when it's taken
from me it's really difficult for me to
adjust that's that's it in a nutshell
also this video will brought up the
bitrate thing so this video is streaming
right now I believe at twenty thousand
kilobits per seconds at 20 megabits per
second which is a pretty good bitrate I
have it set to variable in in the
YouTube interface so
right now YouTube is probably just
streaming at a variable bitrate of
anywhere between 10 and 20 thousand
depending on how well the computers
doing
I do have an 8700 K in this system the
streaming system and right now CPU usage
is that 20% were encoding X dot 264 or
x264 and right now it's pretty stable we
have no dropped frames absolutely none
and we're at a stable 60fps streaming
straight from a capture card from my
sony a7s 2 so if you're wondering what
configure we're using right now to
stream apart from the mic that I
mentioned earlier that's what's going on
brian says not much just testing out
some products cutting some reviews
I heard you cut your thumb too pretty
bad I gotta watch that video that I saw
I think I saw a picture of what you did
or at least the end result of it you
sliced it really bad
I need a need to catch up on your life
Brian you do some gonna do some digging
some investigative work my life isn't
the same without you Brian all right
let's see why our people say 45 oh my
gosh everyone saying 40 thousand subs
I'm not gonna I'm just gonna let y'all
roll it's cool what's up alias I see
those three stars by owning you guys are
awesome members I appreciate your
support and for stopping by
I'm this Sunday night depending on what
day wow I just noticed that the
autofocus totally lost my face when I
scratched my eye and still not focused
there it goes
wow that was pretty that was pretty bad
I need to fix that
let's see Co fossa a sense that science
2d what was your channel ever called
Salazar studio any mean what was my
channel you mean when was my channel
ever called science it was called that
about a year ago maybe two years ago and
it was only like that for about 8 months
we switched back to this just because I
realized that ultimately a majority of
the fan base or the subscriber base
science studio revolves around text so
if I wanted to change this into
something else I would lose a lot of you
which would not be my goal so I mean I
kind of ultimately been to your will
like if you guys want to see certain
kind of content it's my responsibility I
think as a content creator who has subs
that have demain
to sculpt mike-mike content around what
you guys expect to see and if I do
something weird like you guys crucify me
sometimes when I post car reviews or
things that I've nothing to do with
computers you're like oh what channel is
this again but and I get it right like I
kept the channel name vague science
studio because I want to do more than
just computers but most most of you
subscribed because of computers so I'm
kind of a kind of just yeah kind of just
here toast asks what happens when you
remove a boot drive when you remove a
boot drive then your system just stays
at the post screen and asked where you
want to boot from what drive and you
ultimately aren't gonna have a drive to
boot from so you're gonna be funneled
back into your BIOS and you're gonna get
this is like BIOS boot loop thing like
you're not gonna get anywhere past that
because obviously you don't have an
operating system in which to boot its
evilly hat a $1.99 super chair I
appreciate that
hi Greg can you say hi Nick okay ready
three two one hello Nick I hope you feel
like you got your money's worth on that
one awesome I appreciate it
let's see here
I see tech - my life says wassup and
Greg what's going on my dude I'm just
chilling here honestly looking for some
intense questions let's see here I see
Nick
Nero what do you think of a RT x22 TI is
dying I'm not sure about 22 T eyes I
haven't tested 20 ATT eyes I did have a
weird thing going on with a couple of my
r-tx 2080s and this is something that I
haven't actually isolated yes I don't
want to talk too much about it because I
don't know for sure what was causing the
weird issues on screen I do know that
when I switched my monitor the issue was
fixed so and the monitor that I was
running originally was a g-sync monitor
so I just replaced that totally with
this 4k panel behind me and this one's
not g-sync and it worked perfectly fine
I when I would bump the refresh rate up
on that juicing panel it totally lost it
like everything it was flashing
artifacting everything so I don't know
if that was card related or if it was
just some incompatibility with G sync or
that particular software release I have
no idea but I am interested to see what
the other guys come
with what they ultimately conclude based
on what you know they're seeing with all
this cards so we'll see I don't expect
it to be like to widespread an issue
like you know our txk like anything
super substantial where they have
massive recalls and stuff although I
mean I'm sure there are some people out
there who would who would appreciate
Nvidia going through something like that
just because they they hate Nvidia at
this point so we'll see let's see what's
going on here yeah I and mr. kernels z28
asked any truth of the mounting pressure
on the twenty series that might be
causing the issues thought I have no
idea I really don't like what I just
said is basically the extent that I know
of firsthand and I don't even know if
Minds related to everything anything
else I'm sorry that anyone else is
investigating so really don't know it's
really it's just gonna depend on again
how many more cards we get coming in
like I don't have anyone else sending me
cards or anything
we've just from the vendors but not from
third parties you know individuals out
there so we will see let's see I see a
good question from Canon Shane see Greg
do you think it's worth buying a bulk
sized SSD like 500 gig plus at this very
moment or should we wait and see what
pricing does I mean you're almost at the
if you live in the u.s. like Black
Friday is right around the corner Cyber
Monday I would wait a little longer if
like if you don't need one right now
just wait I think that's the most
logical thing to do it's a union three
four seven six do you think a GTX 1080
is strong enough to drive three 1440p
monitors if you want a game with three
1440p monitors like an ultra ultra wide
format no it's not gonna be strong
enough I know that firsthand especially
in like that you know some modern
triple-a titles medium to high settings
definitely not going to be strong enough
so I would recommend to 1080 T eyes to
drive that kind of resolution or a
couple r-tx 20 ATS or 20 DTI you're
gonna need some serious horsepower for
that just because you know I remember
when I got my first triple monitor setup
I ran things off of a 970
and it was the most abysmal experience
ever so you know when you when you force
a card to work against two or three
different monitors that are each around
1080p resolution a piece I mean you're
literally multiplying things right so
you have one pixel then you're
multiplying the workload by two for two
screens and by three for three screens
it's a lot of work for a single graphics
card and a 1080 honestly is going to be
it's going to be difficult to yeah it's
gonna be able to drive those those kinds
of resolutions let see King of Hearts
says damn peep the new Walter White back
there that's right video is coming got
the autofocus is so trash I'm just gonna
manually do it let's see here I can't
see myself though so this is gonna be
awkward because I'm gonna have to like
my my heads-up display or whatever you
want to call it my display up there is
off because I have everything running
into the camera so it's like going in
and out pretty whack to those we'll have
to have to fix this and the problem is
my my aperture is so it's like wide open
right now so any sort of depth forward
or backward right it's gonna put me in
blur I'm kind of come I'm kind of
concerned at this point and there's
gonna be a 20-second delay no matter
what I do let's see I King RPG do you
think RAM prizes will keep falling lower
than they already have anytime soon I I
literally at least a video about that
eye King like five days ago go watch
that video I talked about it
specifically
shurik says roses are red that is right
okay scrolling down
puh-puh-puh buh-buh-buh France that
November 2018 is shaping up to be a
great mom yeah aliases because my auto
focus is effed up because I'm looking at
the screen I'm looking into the camera
the camera does a great job locking onto
my face constantly when I'm looking at
the screen because I'm pivoting back and
forth between the screen and the camera
lens it's losing track of my face and
because I am live-streaming and I don't
have a screen to look at I'm gonna have
to focus with a 20 second delay and
that's gonna be a pain so we'll see
we'll see I'm watching it I'm gonna try
to face more this way when I talk
it's here scrolling said Taurus is I
have the gtx 1070 of your original
walter white built still running super
strong thank you again it's in good
hands
awesome dude that's awesome Taurus I
remember I remember you winning that and
you sent me a video when you got the
card and that was actually one of the
first like big giveaways we ever did
like that I could gtx 1070 is like the
most expensive thing I ever gave away
and it was it was a little I'll admit it
was a little bitter first for me because
that was like the most powerful card I
had I bought that card for my own money
and and you know I was hoping that it
would go to somebody who really needed
it I saw your old system and I think I
think it's safe to say you needed a
graphics card upgrade and so hopefully
the 1070 is again still treating you
well it sounds like it is and I'm glad I
went to you dude cuz you know you're a
genuine guy and I saw your video and I
thought that was really cool most people
and they went something they'll never
talk to you again but but you you took
the time to you know make a thank-you
video kind of and that was that really
was awesome so I'm glad to see that you
were doing well said
and hopefully it'll serve you well for
years to come
I imagine 1072 could be that they're
gonna be the standard the benchmark for
quite a while when it comes to price to
performance especially used now you can
get used 10 70s for 200 to 250 bucks we
have videos about that by the way so if
you haven't watched those yet you just
do a quick eBay search you'll find much
cheaper cards wow I just realized that
this is cut off a little bit it may fix
this
let's see alt pull it up there we go
now I'm gonna inch this dent home there
we go
whoops okay
what does leave it like that for now
let's see a Portland Trail Greg do
another Black Friday video with McLovin
I could do that yeah you probably do
that again okay I'm gonna lock the
autofocus oh give me a second I'm gonna
hold my hand right here so that it locks
on my hand hopefully we'll see I'll lock
it
oh okay let's see if that locked no it
didn't
Oh know how to focus how to focus almost
there that's pretty good I just realize
I could see myself in OBS so it's kind
of stupid even bring up the monitor
thing yeah that's not bad we'll just
leave it like that and yeah so the focus
thing shouldn't go out of whack anymore
scrolling down traveling down cow war
kaworu says sue how would AMD handle
real time rate racing raw power or
specialized tech look so real-time ray
tracing is something that we we have
videos talking about it and the intense
right behind the scenes workload these
graphics cards have to kind of offset by
a frame interpolation and just by a eye
so the reason why RT is what it is right
ray tracing and the reason why we have
tensor cores and other things in our TX
cards is because our TX cards are still
not doing full-time ray tracing our TX
cards are interpolating and predicting
the outcome the the next frame based on
that artificial kind of interpretation
they'll take like a sample of rays and
then they'll extrapolate and that's the
artificial intelligence behind it that's
why tensor cores are so important in
those cards so the cards themselves
aren't doing the entire ray-tracing
workload they're actually doing a small
fraction of it so we're not even at the
point where we're doing a fully great
rais'd thing right we don't we don't
have that yet and if these cards had to
fully read trace they would struggle
big-time so with that said I imagine AMD
will have to come up with some
proprietary way to interpolate it won't
use III really don't think architectural
e speaking I think they'll have
something similar to what NVIDIA has
it's not gonna be the exact same thing I
wouldn't I would probably put money on
that but they're gonna have to come up
with some proprietary way to interpolate
frames in a similar fashion to what
Nvidia does because if they want to
compete on the developer stage they have
to come with something similar enough to
where developers can utilize that
process or manipulate it in a similar
way to what Nvidia's doing so that the
don't you don't have that that mismatch
right so if I want to play a game and
turn rate racing on and I have an Nvidia
card it works fine then I swap with my
AMD card and it starts running like
trash that's gonna make AMD look
terrible in a mew doesn't want that so
they're gonna have to do again something
that's similar but it's not going to be
exactly the same I'm working out to
figure out how its implemented in the
long run but I think right now there
have to totally redesign their
architecture from the ground up
I think GCN at this point and GCN's just
with the integration of h BM h BM to
made things really costly I think they
can have to ditch it all together and do
something totally different that that's
my that's my take at least we will see
ok here we go
contra says Greg do you think I should
get a different CP from my 2700 X 4 240
Hertz some games actually do very well
with it games like rocket Li play it 240
no problem what I have issues upgrading
my 970
a different CPU from your xx your 2700 X
is perfectly fine I would not upgrade
that like you're pretty much capped out
you're gonna have a couple you'll see
you know maybe five to ten percent 10%
pushing it if you went with like the
full-fledged Intel counterpart but I
would say mostly but like a five percent
Delta if you swap that for a 9900 K so I
don't think the upgrading is even
possible or even worth doing the other
thing is when used when you're trying to
hit 240 Hertz your you're just gonna
have to really drop settings which is
gonna offset that load big time onto
your cpu or really beefed up your
graphics occur because the 970 is not
going to cut it unless you're playing a
lower end game or a game that's not as
intensive right from from a hardware
perspective so you got to play around
with it you'll feel it out and every
game again will be different so good
luck with that okay let's see Tech tuner
says he's building his brother a live
streaming or building his brother a
budget gaming PC the last games keeping
him company
I appreciate that dude that's awesome
and you know I've
I've given it thought the past like we
have a second channel and the second
channel is mainly for like politics
satire and it's called satire studio but
that channel is more or less like my
chance to kind of speak my mind whereas
here I feel like I'm a little restricted
in terms of what I can say because I
have to be I don't want to say
politically correct but I have to I have
to be sensitive to all cultures and all
points of view at least to an extent and
when I'm not sensitive to those points
of view you guys I mean I you know look
at my I read a MV subreddit hate video
or hate comment video you know like that
one was that was fun but I you know I
think it's about how you say things and
the reason why I think I got so much
hate for that video was because the way
I was saying things when I told people
is like look horizon fives not gonna
outperform Intel's Core i5 lineup it's
not gonna happen and sure I mean I was
right I think we proved it and multiple
tech tubers actually proved it and I
took all of their results as well and
said look I'm not the only one saying
this you know I'm not you know twisting
my data to make myself look right others
are confirming this as well but when I
came out and said it before we actually
had the results people just were so
firmly against what I had to say I lost
like probably four thousand subs I think
in one day after that video but you know
what I was right and though I think the
one thing I would change about it is the
way I said it because my tone was a
little aggressive it was like look you
know I I probably sounded condescending
in the way that I said Intel's gonna be
better Intel's better because of this
this and this you guys are you know
you're over hyping it you're gonna be
disappointing when it comes out it turns
out not to be great yeah I think that
the presentation could have been
definitely toned down so going forward I
told myself that I would be a little
less insensitive when it comes to
controversial topics and this is just
strictly related to tech here right but
on sat to our studio I totally don't
care about any of that you know I I just
I say what I feel like saying my opinion
based on what I've seen with regards to
any topic basically and I have a lot of
plans for that channel because I think
it's I think those kinds of channels
right now are doing really well
on YouTube I think YouTube is
prioritizing channels that are very like
political in nature but also very
entertaining in the sense that like you
subscribe because of the person because
of that person's personality maybe
they're very charismatic or they're very
funny or they're just very serious and
daunting like they're there's always a
reason why you sub to somebody and you
create some sort of like emotional
attachment to that person you're you
know some kind of relationship that you
have with the with the content creator
and I want to give people that
experience I want to kind of open up new
doors and see where that goes
so we'll see but yeah with regard to
Tona I think that definitely things
could be you know I've learned a lot
let's just say that I've learned a lot
in the four or so years that I've been
doing this three and a half seems like
it's almost been six but it's a lot less
than that we started back in 2015 was
the 2015 I think so so yeah let's see
scrolling down here
she said Torres give me 2020 in Mexico
is it Mexican pesos is that what Amex is
I have no idea
I appreciate that said you didn't have
to do that but I wanted people to know
that you're genuine do deny and I really
appreciated the the way that you
responded to that and the way that you
handled the situation when he found out
you won that was that was awesome
okay scrolling up here I see David Morse
fight all the super chat mon dieu do you
think that 1366 eons would still make
good cheap render box for premiere a
after-effects looks like had other
things I definitely am not the person to
ask that I I know that those neons pack
a punch
I know that Bryan uses quite a few of
them and he would be a better person to
ask that question to but in general I
would say the IPC loss between three or
four generations on until side is maybe
20 25 percent max that means it let's
say you're going from Ivy Bridge to
coffee lake you're gonna see maybe a 20
I would say 20 to 30 percent it's gonna
be your your range for the most part
improvement in performance per clock
right that's instructions per clock so
on a clock - clock basis how many more
instructions can that CPU handle from
generation to generation and I think if
we skip back between four or five
generations we're going to
about a 20 to 30 percent boost so if you
are willing to take that cup you can
build a really cheap Platt system my on
that platform I think that's certainly
viable and that's what I mean Brian does
that all the time like that's his
channel revolves around those ultra
budget finds and you know he finds old
hardware people might people may have
forgotten about maybe the CPUs are
selling for like 10 bucks and nobody
wants them
and like he takes that stuff and he
proves that it's still viable especially
from a value perspective if you're not
looking for the best of the best just
the best bang for the buck and see Brian
right here says you can do anything with
a Zeon end of story there you go let's
see here dolfin ight asks I'm trying to
sell my old laptop with an i7 6700 HQ
128 gig SSD one terabyte hard drive gtx
960m
MSRP is $1200 any tips for selling so
the first thing I do go online check
what others are selling similar products
for and then if you want a quick sale
undercut all of those offers and sell
yours for less than theirs and you'll be
the first to sell your product assuming
your products in good shape so if you
want to undercut the competition that's
what you do you take the small loss but
you sell it immediately you know there's
a time value associated with money so if
that's a big deal to you then do that
otherwise if you want to be competitive
price it in the middle if you want to be
a little more stubborn with it price it
slightly above that bulk of products
being sold again that had the similar
specs to yours and then you can justify
it when people ask you hey why is this
more expensive oh well you know these
people they have problems with theirs
you see scratches and screen and stuff
mines in pristine condition you can kind
of play around with it but every market
is different so if you want to sell on
eBay you're gonna have to use eBay as
your kind of like your your standard if
you want to sell it locally check
Craigslist if you want to just kind of
eyeball it throw you know throw a number
a number out there just ballpark it and
see how many bytes you get that could be
another way to handle it too so that's
just my in a nutshell way of approaching
sales especially when I don't know how
much my product is worth I I just look
at what others selling them for and
typically the markets gonna be pretty
accurate when it comes to that
okay here scrolling up scrolling up to
buh-buh-buh-buh-buh sound effects so 9
says science studio honestly I didn't
think that it was your tone in that
video he's referring to that AMD rise in
5 or sci-fi video I think with society
today people are just going to be
offended by anything doesn't fit their
narrative yet to an extent I feel like
that's an easy cop-out but I definitely
see that I'm not gonna blame that
totally on the situate I'm not gonna
blame the situation totally on that I
should say but you know you live and you
learn I I'm I'm a young guy I have
plenty to learn especially when it comes
to to being social especially online
right with Jesus a number of people when
we have coming up on four hundred
thousand subs probably happened today or
tomorrow you know that's a lot of
different people from a lot of different
countries from a lot different cities a
lot different cultures religions
everything and you know I kind of have
to I kind of have to find a way to
approach my content to all of them with
like a you know he's got to be sensitive
it's really no other way to say it I
don't like being sensitive but you have
to be if you want you know if you want
to build a fanbase because if you don't
if you're not sensitive at least to an
extent you're going to polarize your
audience you're going to have only you
know a certain group of fans that are ok
with it that are maybe really you know
insensitive themselves and then you're
just it's just one big groupthink cycle
you know I don't want that I want all
points of view I encourage people to
challenge my my notions I encourage
people to contradict what I say just to
start an argument like you can argue
just to argue that's fine but actually
have a reason for doing it have a point
to back up and and use data you know use
first-hand accounts like that that's
that's all useful information and anyone
who says otherwise is just being
ignorant and and science requires
individuals to be open-minded it does
because science changes you know we have
laws we have theories we have things
that we have no idea about we just we
just take shots in the dark and guess
but it requires people to challenge the
status quo to
make real change and you know if it
Jesus if I'm going to have a channel
called science to do but not uphold that
virtue if you will then I'm just being
hypocritical so one big learning process
again you know I'm only 24 that's not an
excuse it's not excuse to be immature or
make dumb mistakes all the time and I
very much try to limit those I think the
one big mistake if you want to call it
big that I ever made on the channel was
was when I thought that the NZXT hue
Plus had blown up my power supply I was
convinced I had no idea that I was using
the wrong cable with that modular PSU I
had no idea I just took for granted the
fact that it was the correct cable and
of course I know not to mix cables I
mean I know that the pin outs are all
different that's why some of them were
keyed certain ways this one just
happened to fit where it did but you
know I was also very quick to make an
apology video when I found out right
when I found it I sat in front of the
camera and I just said look guys I'm
sorry
this is what really happened this is why
I'm this is why I'm wrong and this is
how to test it is that a figure out if
it's you know if you have a suspicion
similar to mine this is how you can test
it to confirm whether or not you are or
right in your thinking you know when I
thought I'd narrow down all the
variables turns out I actually didn't
and that's that's when you just got a
Getty Crow and you got a man up and and
and you know fess up so that that's the
one big thing that I've had to deal with
in the channel I still have people every
now and then the just the whole like
entity forever they'll never let it go
because of course they've never made a
mistake in their life so that that's
always gonna I think follow me to an
extent but you know I think the ones
that that appreciated it at least
appreciated the apology and we're
willing to to stick around have seen I
guess my improvement at least in my
approach to testing and verifying and
I'm not so quick to jump the gun anymore
and hopefully as I age I will be even
slower to jump you know to actually come
to conclusions you have to be very
careful because you know companies are
at stake
you know money is on the line you know
everything is delicate so yeah there's
my there's my little spiel there but see
Patriot Act Patriot 7 6 - what is that
you're 100
honest opinion on r-tx if you are paying
out of pocket considering use gtx prices
I've given my honest opinion in multiple
videos Patriot I would I would invite
you to watch any of my RT X content and
I'll give you my honest opinion in any
of those like you don't have to ask me
in a live stream to get my honest
opinion I'll just tell you in the video
cuz I don't I'm not afraid of hurting a
company's feelings because I feel a
certain way you know what I mean like
that that's something I'm not gonna I'm
not gonna sugarcoat that if you want to
call that insensitive fine but I'm more
sensitive to you guys because if I lose
you then the channels done for I could
still make I I could probably still make
decent content if I lost my big vendors
the companies that send me stuff to
review and test that's a big chunk of
the channel but if I lost them the
channel would still be here you guys
would hopefully still be here for the
most part but if I lost all of you then
I lose the vendors too because why would
they send products to a guy that doesn't
even have viewers so it's one big circle
and you guys are at the center of it and
I don't want to lose you so you know I I
would 100% rather be honest with you
than be honest with companies that
either send me stuff to test or send me
stuff for free or send me money for you
know a product placement or a sponsored
spot whatever so here we go
alias asked do you play racing games of
course I played Gran Turismo
all growing up and then when I got an
Xbox one I switched over to Forza for a
while and then now I've switched back
over at Gran Turismo sport on the ps4
Pro it's like the one game that I play
on console still although I might get
into red dead bird entrant redemption -
at some point you're soon I just I can't
come to terms with paying like 80 bucks
or 60 bucks for a like for a game like
that's that's really expensive I know
that's been the norm for a long time but
that's a lot of money for a game so it
takes me a while to cough up the dough
for a game like that but once I do I
don't see the buyer's remorse I just
actually have to commit so maybe I'll
commit here off soon anyway excuse me
okay I'm going to scroll up here so I
can see what I missed
okay Sam s donated to year row or is
that pounds that's pounds thanks Sam s
he says my mate tom says to paste my PA
see you to cool it legit paste it won't
even taste it like thermal compound were
you talking about
I'm confused by the question but feel
free to ask it again I'll look for it
in the chat so you don't this super chat
me again let's see Ben B says your
demeanor is much more welcoming now than
when you first started that's a
compliment
well that's good that's definitely part
of the thing I've been trying to change
you know I think I think part of it too
is like when your cuz I'm really young
you're like I'm a lot younger than the
big guys I'm a lot younger than Jay and
Paul and Kyle and lot in line it's like
like I said I'm in like early 20s I just
got out of college so I think I think I
can come across as as like egotistical
self-centered if I if I you know try to
fit in with the older guys but at the
same time know in the back of my mind
that I don't have necessarily all the
experience that they do and that's again
part of learning process you know I have
experience in school but that's like
that's school like you don't actually
have field experience from school so
there there's two sides to every coin
and I'm trying to fill the other side
right now I'm trying to actually gain
the experience to be one of those
prominent names in the tech space I'm
not there yet I don't think I'm there
yet I I I imagine I won't be there for
quite a while but if I get there at some
point I'll know it and you guys will let
me know and I'm looking forward to it
that's my it's my goal at this point
let's see scroll down scrolling down
yeah rizz Gras TVs asks me I asked you a
question in two messages since is
limited to hundred letters you should
have asked your question now cuz I was
reading your question so I might not see
it anymore there's a lot of stuff going
on in the chat just ask your question
don't ask me if you can ask a question
what I would do is like type it up in a
notepad or something and then just copy
half of it paste it then copy other half
paste it really quick and send both back
to back so that I can read it all at one
time that's what I would have done so
try it again let's see if I see it Night
Circus you have a full-time job related
to your degree absolutely not I do this
full-time
and
I'm very fortunate to be able to do this
full-time but if I was working full-time
it would be in the field I'd be on an
oil rig somewhere managing a bunch of
derrickman or doing it myself it's just
or maybe you're refining I don't know I
have a petroleum engineering bachelor's
and I have a Masters of Business
Administration so I can really work
anywhere with with the MBA but my
engineering side of things definitely
has me offshore or onshore on a rig
somewhere pretty isolated so it just
depends right brian says just teleport
to the future screw it I think I want to
do that I'll see you later Brian I gotta
go I gotta use my teleportation device
I'll let you know Dischord how it goes
uh let's see
okay Jeff B says Greg Congrats
thank you Jeff B I appreciate that just
FYI my name is GRE G with 1g I don't
know why that bothers me so much but
like I feel like when I see the two g's
I'm like Greg googa with two geez that's
not I'm just one G I'm not I'm simple
you know I'm not I'm not confusing
people with the way I spell my name so
there you go
okay scrolling down here buh-buh-bah
scrolling down you guys ahh doop okay
card mule four one two seven one what is
this card me oh I want to switch my GPU
and CPU over to a custom water loop is
there any company's products you would
recommend over another any tips you have
for a first time loop builder okay my
big three are gonna be ek obviously UK
makes really good stuff ek alpha cool
and then it's I like bit bits power bits
power is really good I've used bits
power products I've also used
promotional stuff before I'll tell you
who the who makes really cool stuff
though like really like specific stuff
fantex makes really cool blocks and
especially for the CPUs and then
really cool reservoirs so if you're into
like DDC pumps they have a reservoir I
actually have two different reservoirs
ones a 220 mil reservoir and then once a
110 Miller is where I want to say or 120
I forget and then you can actually mount
a DDC pump directly to it so it doesn't
take up much space and that's a really
cool combo for like a small form-factor
build I've actually used the RFU 20 I
think they call it from fantex have used
that reservoir in a recent build know so
if you want to check that on the channel
you certainly can but yeah that was I
mean those are the big three though I
would say ek alpha cool and then
probably bits power would be my third it
really depends and there are a lot of
like third-party vendors - they make
really good stuff but in general like if
you're looking like digging you know big
name stuff with great warranties those
are the ones that we go for okay let's
see Demetrius that's nice - do I have a
left over I 575 hundred okay are X 480
okay eight gigs of ram and a 550 watt
power supply would it be best to just
build a PC and sell it or just sell this
stuff individually it really depends I
think people will pay more for a fully
built PC because they expect kind of a
small markup right for building it
maintaining and stuff installing
operating system you could part it out
but people are gonna be a lot in my
experience people are more stingy when
you part stuff out so if you want to be
in and then you have to deal with
actually selling individual components
meeting people individually so there's a
lot to consider when selling individual
I would just build it make it look as
clean as possible and sell it as is one
whole unit I think you'll have a better
time doing that you'll probably make
more money in the process
okay scrolling down here I see a super
chat from Rehan 14 Maz $2 Canadian super
chat my dude I appreciate that can you
make a custom PC on iBUYPOWER
custom PC what do you mean like I think
you can pick the parts and stuff on
ibuypower if you can't pick the parts
you can still pick individual builds if
you want to call that custom sure but
that's a prebuilt
like I buy power builds pre-built stuff
as far as I know so I wouldn't
necessarily call that custom unless like
you're doing some
to it to change it up so that's just
that's just my take on it no okay let's
see
Ferno three five seven two four ninety
nine stupid Chapman do not appreciate
that
I got a GTX ten eighty over stock from
my Crescenta for 369 that's an awesome
deal actually that's not far off from
what they're selling for used so that's
a really good deal especially if you got
that like open box tour basically new
that's a really good deal micro centers
are freaking awesome we've got a few
videos when we go into micro centers I
really love them and they have great
deals especially great bundles if you're
willing to bundle a CPU and a
motherboard like that's that's an
awesome opportunity of you if you're
willing to do that to commit to buying
like a full platform then that's where
you're gonna see most of your discount
is it a place like Micro Center so just
my take on it let's see scrolling down
it's dis Sagna it says at science video
I've watched the stuff you do for well
over two years about to build a second
PC thanks for all the content in my 9700
K and Z 390 tai chi or overclocked in
your honor that's awesome I appreciate
that
and I do hope that going forward you
have no issues with your system I know
my buddy Tony you guys know Tony over it
reality PC customs Tony was telling me
today he put together an AMD system this
was the first time he'd use AMD as far
as I'm aware in quite a while he just
you know he's like screw it I'm gonna
try rising I've heard great things about
rising especially from you Gregg great
value and it looks to be awesome so I'm
gonna go ahead and build a I think it
was a 2700 AK so he just went all out
and he got it all set up and and then he
texted me actually like today I think
and he said I'm getting like these
random blue screens of death he goes I
tried to troubleshoot it I'd you know I
figured out what was causing it and I
went to the forums to see how to fix it
and there wasn't like any clear you know
solution to fix the problem and I was
like dude like you know that's that
sucks first off like this is your first
rise in experience and you're getting
consistent blue screens like you know
persistent blue screens and I tried to
help a little bit like you know try
flashing a new BIOS make sure you're up
to date you know don't overclock keep
your BIOS talk try XMP all kinds of
stuff like it wasn't working for
and I haven't you know I still don't
know what the heck was causing it he was
kind of worried because he had like - I
think two days left to return his stuff
because my Crescenta has like that
14-day return policy so he told me like
I hope it doesn't let me saying is I
don't think of mine but he told me he
went back and then he just swapped the
platform out he got I think at 8700 K
for like 300 bucks even if they had an
open box one behind the counter or an
overstock one I can't remember so that's
like that's again that's another good
deal right cuz I 787 turkeys are selling
for 350 to 400 bucks now especially with
the supply shortage kind of taking hold
so he found a really good deal it sucks
that he's not gonna get to experience
you know full-fledged horizon but at
least he was able to you know have a
system that worked and didn't
persistently blue screen so yeah Micro
Center is micro centers the bomb really
I mean there's so much you can do a
micro Center and if you guys haven't
gone to one and you live near one I
encourage you just pop in just make sure
you hold your wallet tight cuz you're
gonna want to throw cash it's tough it's
really difficult not to I mean when you
see all those good deals they got on all
kinds of CPUs and motherboards got rows
of graphics cards now you do you didn't
a year ago but now you do it's it really
is a treat for anybody who enjoys PC
building the art of PC building and just
testing tech okay let's scroll down here
Dixie 11 how old are you I said that
earlier I am 24 years old scrolling down
here coldy gaming says microsensors the
bomb that it is card me with four one
two seven one again five dollar super
check my dude thank you Greg I was
thinking of going with ek but I just got
my hands on a fan text of all X so I'll
check out the fans fan tech stuff too
for sure dude I'm telling you that
reservoir is awesome looking it's one of
the coolest looking reservoirs out there
in my opinion and then if you're if
you're ok with DD C D DC's are still
great pumps you can mount one of those
to the back of it it's literally built
with a DD C mount and and then there you
go like there's your pump you know pump
res combo straight up and they have
little kits where you can mount the pump
risk combo to like a radiator or a fan
or whatever it's it really is cool I
think you'll enjoy especially the
reservoirs maybe even the CPU blocks
from
antics okay let's see what else do we
have here
alias ass other micro centers in Florida
I thought there weren't any there there
aren't I've had to drive to Micra
centers to get there I've been to micro
centers in Atlanta I've been to micro
centers in Houston I've been to micro
Center in st. Louis I've been to a micro
Center in California I can't remember
which one there's one in Los Angeles
I believe I went to it's like 4 years
ago I was right before I made of my
right before I started YouTube I'm
pretty sure it was in Los Angeles it was
a while back well not Los Angeles but it
was like outside of Los Angeles I'll
have to see yeah I've been in two I've
been in like 3 or 4 and they're all
slightly different the Houston one was
probably my favorite the Atlanta ones
one of them is a little smaller and then
one of them is like really new and
up-to-date and there's a lot of space
there so I think the one in I can't
remember which part of Atlanta it was
gosh I'm sure somebody watching know
someone who looks close there are two
different micro centers in Atlanta and
one of them is in the north side I want
to say and one of them is like the South
e you know south west side I can't
remember anyway you guys know I'm
talking about anyone was in Georgia you
guys know okay but the BA let's see here
Sam s is hey it's me from earlier it was
my mates my mates Stefan who told my
friend Tom about putting thermal paste
on your power supplied to boost wattage
can i really get savannah to watch him
with 200 watt power supply this way
thank you you sound like a troll Sam but
that was a good troll I give you kudos
for that answer is no but if you're
being serious answer is no there you go
I see Quay dogs - 373 says Duluth or
Marietta that's right
Duluth I think I think Duluth is the
older one I can't remember which one it
is
we went we went to both in the videos we
did like a part 1 part 2 we went to boat
I camera which one was that was the
older one the one that we got kicked out
of and then we got asked to stop filming
in it and then the other one was like
the more up-to-date one it
a little bigger I think but yeah but I
mean both are good like if you live in
Atlanta you up to to choose from that's
like an awesome
that's an awesome opportunity so yeah
but I always have to drive because there
is not a micro center in Atlanta Keith
Davidson but when I'm not a super chap
my dude you see yourself working in oil
and gas been with Baker Hughes excuse me
since 2017 my dad works for GE and GE i
think like acquired Baker Hughes or has
some kind of merger whatever with GE oil
and gas so yeah I like I expect myself
at some point to be working in the field
I hope honestly I hope I don't have to
because I really like this job but you
know I have that degree if I need to
work in the field and it pays really
good so I wouldn't be disappointed if I
had to but at the same time like I much
prefer this just because this is no no I
enjoyed this a little more let's see I'm
gonna go back to the live screen here
there we go okay Blackbird six one two
at science studio hey Greg how would you
go about moving your OS from a hard
drive to an SSD if you bought it after
you built your PC there are tools out
there to do the migration it's difficult
as heck you could use like if you have
samsung drives you can do samsung
migration tools like they have their own
proprietary software to to transfer
operating systems and other important
data but in a nutshell especially if
you're if you don't have something like
that and you're going let's say from
like a WD blue to like a Toshiba Drive
SSD then it's gonna be a pain but to get
a ticket your operating system over I
wouldn't trust honestly any opera any
software to transfer my operating system
what I would do is completely start from
scratch and I know you hate to hear that
but I just I just completely reinstall
windows it starts off with a clean slate
your system runs a lot faster you
install the programs you need on the new
system and you can wipe your drive and
use it for whatever you know libraries
and stuff so I hated for that'd be my
answer but in my experience dealing with
third-party software to transfer
operating systems for the most part it's
been like a fly in here but the most
parts just been a terrible time for
me so maybe others have suggestions in
the chat so look out for those let's see
okay Ben b says intel is a data
migration tool for free it works well
okay forget you I mean yeah you could
try that one out I haven't tried that
one so maybe that one's maybe that one's
good let's see here yeah cliff says I
wouldn't transfer hard drive SSD by a
drive cloner could do that that's true
partition wizard hmm let's see question
here taking responsibility consideration
for their risk should I deal in my 8700
K I don't think there's too much of a
risk you know what you're doing like
ideally it's not gonna break your CPU
just make sure using a good tool jib
hours delayed kits are really great
I have reviews of deleting both the 8700
K and actually I deal with in the i-5 to
and I deleted a 79 80 XE like $2,000 CPU
with his massive x2 9 9
you know LGA 2066 scintillated tool and
it worked like a charm too so I trust
his products hundred-percent I had no
issues to date I've had no issues today
and so if you want to do it I would
recommend a kit like that I kept it's
reputable and he shouldn't have a
problem again as long as you know what
you're doing okay let's see here cliff
says Windows does something different
between hard disk drive and SSD Paul's
Hardware answered that video and is in
his asked Paul video interesting that's
convenient though so there you go so you
can watch pause I know Paul just like
the probing Paul series so you can ask
Paul or check out that video I guess he
answered it in that and that reason he
just uploaded today I'm pretty sure I'm
saw the Twitter post for it okay let's
see yes he michael says clean install
period don't try I mean that's what
that's usually what I just said just
like just just install from scratch it
any worth the freaking hassle it's
really not okay
arrow 777 what's a good way to teach
someone about properly putting together
a PC a kid at my school has a lot of
misinformation he claims that he doesn't
need and my help for building a laptop
Lattin building a laptop that's gonna be
that'll be fun Oh
to watch that but for the most part I
mean you can refer to videos we have on
our channel from two other tech tuber
videos plenty of I mean any one of us
has been doing it for at least a year
we've built like maybe four or five pcs
we pretty much all come to consensus
about how it should be done and so I'd
recommend showing him many of our videos
for starters and then you could also use
like websites with like step by step
like how to's and stuff
I wouldn't use like third-party like
random how-to guides unless they're
again from companies that you trust
that's just my opinion because again
those people have experience we've been
doing it a while so I think I think we
know what works and what doesn't
unlike certain companies starting with
the letter V okay I'll go ahead and say
it the verge okay don't watch that video
actually you can't they took it down so
yeah that sucks but you can watch most
of it in my video replying to the verge
video so there you go okay scrolling
scrolling
yep people get AJ ninja tech house
having the vertically mounted GPU
holding up any concerns about temps when
running games AJ I talked about this in
in my vertical amount video go watch the
cable mod vertical mount video and all
that will be answered like I you know I
don't just test things for ten minutes
and say it's stable like I run these
games for hours on end especially when
it comes to testing you know long-term
effects of temperatures long-term
effects of having GPUs heavily under
load CPUs heavily under load and not an
issue at all I mean this bracket is so
far from the glass that it's like
basically having the card horizontally
mounted so there's really no difference
there maybe a couple degrees Celsius and
again it all depends on the case as well
and where your fans are positioned all
that stuff is it plays into it said
Taurus ganma dude 20 MX pesos appreciate
that since your wife with a csgo player
who beats who said we actually have a
video where I 1v1 my wife in csgo you
should watch that video I think you'll
have a laugh let's see here answer a
couple more questions if it's a 10:03
p.m. over here so yeah we'll do a couple
more
so give me some good questions the
closest one out I need two juicy ones
give me something give me like a couple
that are gonna make me do some heavy
digging you know like I I wanna I wanna
have to go and research this like you
know
intense music in the background while
I'm like scrubbing through Wikipedia and
I'm just kidding I can use Wikipedia
anyway
Wikipedia should not be used as a
primary source Wikipedia is a
culmination of multiple primary sources
for the most part so if you use
Wikipedia at all it should be to confirm
what you already have read in your
primary sources okay that's what I'll
say about Wikipedia and and no college
professor for the most part there's
always that exception it's going to
accept Wikipedia as a source especially
not a primary source so there you go
okay grant green feller says low-key
thought your degree would have been
something like an orthodontically I had
I had an expectation at one point I
thought I was gonna go into into the
medical field I thought I was gonna I
actually decided this after I got my
engineering degree believe it or not but
I I had finished it up or I was about to
finish it up and I was like you know
what I need something else I need
something else big that I can feel like
you know I just I have to struggle a
little bit to tackle I like those
challenges and you know because YouTube
is like YouTube's a steady grind right
like you don't really have too many
things that take up too much of your
time or require really intense amounts
of workload to get finished unless you
have like serious embargo problems and
stuff for the most part it's a gradual
grind but when you're in you know
engineering school for a bit I was in a
serious ground I was going straight
uphill I mean it was it was tough to get
through some of that stuff and then and
then in med school obviously like med
school is like one big cliff to go up so
um those I liked those feelings of
accomplishment you know if I can get
through that stuff I feel I feel better
about myself I just have more
self-confidence and and I would be
interested in I mean I think it pays
really well it's a big part of it I I
think I would be good at it to an extent
I'm good at memorizing stuff very
technically oriented but I you know I'm
I don't know I just think it would be a
cool experience I you could be anything
you want if you really put your
to it you know in political and cultural
barriers aside so I just thought it
would be a cool cool challenge and III
was about to I was literally about to
commit and I ran into some issues with
the ha I just had issues with a certain
part of a department that I was
inquiring in I was actually asking some
questions in the department to figure
out what I needed to do what my next
steps needed to be excited a couple
prereqs that I had to take and in order
to qualify for pre-med and I didn't get
the response that I that I was expecting
actually it was like pretty much kicked
out of the whole department threatened
by people they said they were gonna call
the cops
because I was asking questions I mean I
got it you know I've I've pissed people
off and it's been my problem in my fault
in the past but I did nothing wrong here
and it was just a bad time I guess like
they were preoccupied with final exams
and stuff and they didn't want some
random kid coming and asking questions
little do they know that I actually
would have done their program some good
I think I would have been a great
student there I was a good so I was top
15 in my engineering class I think I
would have contributed you know I would
have contributed at least somewhat to
the program but uh nope they kicked me
out so interesting yeah that's my that's
my little take on that I just thought
that I always thought that I would do
something big you know I always wanted
to do something really big make an
impact and so far it's been you tube and
maybe this channel will get to the point
where we're actually six series
impactful on something you know we're
like a the forefront of some certain
technology or certain topic and that
that's my my current dream is to get the
channel to a point where we are
officially recognized it's like the the
channel at the forefront of a certain
topic or whatever so we will see I'm I
did see a question from somebody
let's see scrolling up scrolling up yeah
Lowell's cookie asks what are the signs
of a hard drive dying things will lag
seriously lag when you're trying to pull
data from a hard drive you might even
hear things if the disks are starting to
you know rub and stuff for the
excuse me maybe the motors dying or that
the lasers not working properly then you
could have just you know either the
number of things can grow on hard drives
because they're mechanical but it really
just depends on the the circumstance if
you're hearing anything if you're not
hearing anything but data is still
transferring very slow they could also
be the sign of a dead hard drive or a
hard drive that wouldn't it would die
let's see let's see the demon myth so
I've asked and got an answer from Gian
Steve but I'm curious about your opinion
what are your thoughts about tech
reviewers or tech journalists being
hired by tech companies to to work oh
okay
have you have you thought about it okay
I see recently so yeah I've talked about
this before in my response to the Intel
thing with oh gosh I forget the name of
the company know that until hired to do
it you guys know I'm talking about
so the Intel hired the company to
basically run a bunch of tests regarding
the the new Intel refresh the 19 100k
and stuff and I forget the name of the
someone will know and the chat again
someone will come to the rescue and
anyway the the take that I had on that
was it's not a it's not a big deal for a
company like Intel especially coming as
big as Intel to say hey we want to you
know contract this work out to a
third-party company that does testing
and stuff so they can report back their
results right and we can get a feel for
how our product performs in the real
world by an independent reviewer the
problem is it's not first off it's not
really an independent review if you
yeah principal technologies that's who
it was yeah I see I saw PT that reminded
me there it is
thank you guys okay so when Intel hired
principal talking line they paid him I
don't know how much they paid him but
they paid him a good chunk of change I
imagine that's not really an independent
review in the sense that like the
company is dependent on the payment
right to fulfill the review obligation
or the benchmark obligation so as
principal technologies disclosed
like they said that they were being
contracted or basically paid out by
Intel to run these tests I don't doubt
the fact that principle technology was
neutral in the sense of how they
reported their data I think they made
mistakes especially early on very
blatant mistakes I don't think they
necessarily knew what they were doing
with this stuff
at least when it came to bio settings
and whatnot but I will say this I don't
think there's anything wrong with it so
long as it's properly disclosed and so
long as the company that paid have this
stuff you know reported on and to have
these benchmarks actually kind of
gathered and grouped up as long as that
company doesn't say hey these are our
unbiased results from a third-party
company that took it upon themselves to
do this right
I don't think Intel should do that
because first off when you pay a company
to do it you're you're kind of
exchanging Integrity's a little bit I
get it's it's kind of a it's it's a
mixed bag for me but ultimately I don't
think there's anything wrong with
principle technology's doing it if some
if Intel paid me to say hey run these
benchmarks you know and get back to me
personally that would be it would be
tricky because it's not a review right I
mean is it a review if you're being paid
to review a product you're gonna
benchmark it so maybe it is a review and
if they came at me and said hey we'll
throw a thousand bucks at you to run
benchmarks and report on your video then
it would be very difficult for me to
kind of draw the line and say all right
this is not a review I'm just running
benchmarks objectively and showing them
to all of you that just sounds really
sketchy to me so no look principal
technologies doesn't do this you know
they don't they're not tech tubers who
review you know CPUs for a living I mean
they do a bunch of different principal
technologies is a ton of different stuff
yeah I don't see anything wrong with it
I just don't think that there's a place
for what Intel did in the sense that
they kind of like stood behind those
results and acted like they were the
holy grail all right I think the problem
was without Intel responded to the heat
that they got for it because look if the
if the benchmarks have been done
correctly yet we knew in the background
and the back of our mind that they were
still paid for we would still expect to
you know people to wait for third-party
results third party in the sense that
like we're not being paid we just got
samples we're running our run up in
independent tests so I think there's
still a place for us in the market I
don't think intel cut us out but at the
same time I mean I don't think
principled technologies did anything
wrong so yeah and I talk more about this
coherently in the video but yeah that's
I think the I think the blame was more
on Intel with how they handled the the
backlash that they got from from the
results principled technology went back
and fixed stuff you know they went back
and fixed with a what they messed up and
they went back and fixed more stuff they
messed up and then Intel was kind of
just like hey you know these are the
results you know look at them I don't
know I'm sure there are a lot of
different opinions on the subject
personally I would have a very difficult
time I don't know I could see it though
I mean I've done something similar I did
this I did something similar with Intel
obtained so to be totally intellectually
consistent here if Intel pays for me to
promote let's say obtain then which
they've been doing a lot of like a lot
of tech tubers have promoted obtain if
they if they if you know when they pay
me to do that and this is totally off
code I haven't planned I'm talking about
this so I'm trying to be careful with
how I word this because it is live but
if they pay me to do that and then I go
and I run my tests right and then I
present them to you then you kind of
just don't know you you you still have
to let the viewer know that like look
there are other independent reviews out
there that you should consult first
before determining it then until
obtained is like you know if you want
this totally unbiased thing that's not
paid people always get super super edgy
when they find out the content is paid
for and they should I mean that
rightfully so so you know that goes
without saying I expect everyone who
does proper due diligence won't just
watch one video and conclude whether or
not a product is worth buying I expect
you guys to watch multiple videos not
just the ones that are paid for but
multiple videos out there from several
different people with several different
opinions of preconceived notions and
that will give you the ultimate sin top
of whether or not you should buy the
product there's my take I all end with
that there okay scrolling up here I
missed a couple of questions I was kind
of rambling there but Stephen Henderson
gaming mode should be called thread
Ripper mode yeah I think it's a little
misleading I mean to be fair you a need
kind of weren't that weird and the fact
that it's in BIOS is that that you know
have nothing to do a thread Ripper III
can see that so yeah I I don't know
let's see scrolling up so much waingaya
Geisinger I say that right can we get a
fresh take on the new iPad pro are there
any other competitive products out there
for artists note takers I'm having
trouble coming to terms with like the
viability of tablets in general lisa has
the older iPad pro still with the high
refresh rate screen it's beautiful to
watch I'm actually I'm gonna be
releasing a video very soon regarding a
test between the pixel 3 camera and the
iPhone XR camera so Lisa uses a 10 arc
and I use the pixel 3 and both these
cameras right use kind of like AI
interpretations of like backgrounds and
stuff to isolate 4 pounds of portrait
mode they'd handle light lighting
differently and stuff like that so we're
gonna be doing ahead a comparison
between both cameras I think they're the
perfect match up because both phones
have a single lens a single camera a
single sensor on the rear versus some
phones that have to to kind of not cheat
the system but you know what I mean so
there's there's less software involved
when you have two camera lenses so stay
tuned for that I think it'll be really
good bait I think you guys will enjoy
that I'm scrolling up here I missed a
bazinga 50% bazinga
what are you doing bazinga good to see
you again my dude and I appreciate it
you're always here and gosh you're
always super chatting I don't know what
to say that's a lot of money so thank
you
what's the update on Lisa when was she
be coming home can you review the
Corsair mp5 10 specs look good but
wouldn't love a full review so bazinga
talk about this in the last livestream
the birthday stream but Lisa is here she
got approved for a b2 visa so she is
here and she got approved for it on the
terms that she would come and see her
husband so they know exactly what she's
doing like
we're still waiting for her or her
marriage visa to get approved so and
it's gonna take roughly five to six more
months for that so the good thing is
like the b2 visa allows her to stay here
for six months she's got a plane to get
headed back home on like August or nagas
April 10th
I believe so she gets to be here for
five or six months and hopefully by then
like worst case you know she's still got
to go back she has to do her interviews
and stuff but hopefully we won't have to
wait much longer for her to actually be
here permanently to become a permanent
resident so that is exciting thanks for
asking about that she's actually in the
other room right now I don't know doing
something probably playing with her
friends on online or whatever and she's
gonna get into streaming here very soon
again - so if you guys are watching her
on Twitch I hope you guys will join her
again in the future
cuz she'll be she'll be doing that quite
a bit coming up and then asked for the
Corsair MP 510 I'm gonna look that up
with C MP 510 what am i Corsair MP 510 I
don't that doesn't come up much might be
a hold on them I type in course ATAR
then okay there we go okay MDOT - so a
PCI Express four-lane okay
I looks pretty fast high-end contender
okay let's see what the Trent Wow Oh
38:34 80 megabytes per second
twenty-seven hundred megabytes per
second that's a really fast Drive Jesus
yeah I'll tell you what what I'll do
I'll see if I can I'm gonna make a note
and I'm gonna send Justin from Corsair
an email asking if we can review one of
those I'll just get a smaller size from
them and see if we can do a dedicated
review on it and then talk about the
viability of m2 s in generals MP 510
awesome I will make a note of it right
in here I'll just leave this page open
so I don't forget thanks again bazinga
and yeah stay tuned for that because
I'll send them an email very soon I got
to send out emails anyway for CES coming
up so I'll soon was all out at once and
we will see what's good
anyway folks you guys have been awesome
I'm looking through trying to see if I
miss a few more questions and here Luke
w6 Congrats Gregg I appreciate that Luke
thanks for dropping by
let's see scrolling up scrolling my name
is Jeff at science to do what is your
opinion on the rise in 2400 G as a
budget build CPU after being overclocked
for gigahertz
I think it's viable I think you're still
making compromises by going with an APU
so look if you get a 2400 G you really
haven't in my opinion no need to go for
a GT 1030 or anything like that
it just doesn't make sense if you go for
like a gtx 1060 right if you buy a gtx
1060 and then a 2400 g like you might as
well just buy the 1400 or the 1500 X or
the 2600 you know for like 30 bucks more
that that's that's my my opinion on the
matter the 2600 is a killer CP for the
bargain for the price so and I have a
video on that very recent video check it
out if you haven't already but if you're
just going for an APU build no discrete
graphics then the 24 energy is good it's
it's better than the a and the it's
better than the Intel alternative let me
say that so there we go let's see here's
ghrelin Brentwood says you rename your
channel of science studio was there
plans on doing other material not
related to PC hardware so Brent the
original channel name was science studio
it was like that for two years or so I
changed it to Salazar Studio salad was
my last name I changed it to that
because I expected to do stuff outside
of the realm of tech with this channel
but then I realized over time that like
you know 95% of you subscribed for
computer tech stuff and I totally get
that that's like you know that's why you
subbed in the first place and I wanted
to stay true to that so that's why I
ultimately switched back I changed my
mind and I just reaffirm the science
studio name because that's why a lot of
you subscribed in the first place so
yeah I did have I did have plans with
that channel or with this channel to
take it you know abroad but I've since
kind of just refocused it back on the
stuff that you guys subscribe for we
have a separate channel for the crazy
stuff for the random stuff the talking
stuff the vlog stuff
and that that's where I think it's gonna
stay for now okay I see one more super
jet super jet from men back for the win
men back I know you can't like ask a
question I think when you when you
donate a dollar but if you want to ask a
question I'm looking in the chat right
now for it
so that I can answer your question
because I appreciate the super chat and
then we're gonna close it out here no
problem my name is Jeff I see no problem
my dude let's see
Cameron sip thoughts on the build risin
727 RDX 1070 TI 16 gigs ripped off 3200
perfect Cameron that's a well balanced
system right there my friend let's see
here so Torres says I don't know who
asked about the AP but my cousin was
gaming on that bad boy and it runs
pretty well actually he plays even
destiny and some other stuff and medium
settings in 1080p not bad for an APU
again that's not bad at all so yeah and
that's the thing like you're gonna make
compromises obviously anything about
1080p is gonna be really difficult for
that apu but if you wanted to play with
some settings in that resolution it's
it's easy men back at for the wind says
no question just because well member I
appreciate it thanks for the super chair
I saw you just subbed as well so awesome
thanks for stopping by hopefully you
enjoy the content if you haven't checked
something that I encourage you to do so
and I think this is where we're gonna
call it Owen Gish says what's the second
channel name it's called satire studio
that's the name of it right there and
it's weird error try again
that's joyed satire studio why is it
like blocking am i blocked did I block
myself anyway SAT I re satire studio
like science studio bits a taste it
you'll see the logo it's exactly the
same as this logo it's supposed to be
purple it's purple on Twitter but I
haven't changed it yet so if you want to
watch our first video we have on the
channel there it's a it's a more
personal topic relating to the stuff
that we've experienced here in Panama
City after Hurricane Michael then I'm
for you to watch that I'm gonna be very
I don't expect to be very political in
nature but it will be political we don't
talk about politics here on science
studio at all
but we'll talk about it there on
Saturday you'll figure out where I fall
into the spectrum we know my opinions on
certain things totally open-minded over
there
and that we talk about everything that's
my plan anyway so if you want to
subscribe to that I would appreciate it
that's gonna be our second spin-off
channel and hopefully it will become a
fun podcast channel where we can talk
about anything and everything and not be
offended because being offended by
everything in 2018 is pretty much like
the epitome of 2018 so yeah I can't wait
for 2019 I see said Torres give another
10 Mexican pesos said I appreciate that
my dude I really appreciate it you guys
don't have to do that I see another one
from Luke W $10 my dude I appreciate it
broke student here but I'll chip in on
taking your lady out to eat uh-huh
that's awesome I actually told her today
just like right before I started life
Jimmy I said hey how about we go to the
beach tomorrow she got a couple things
to do with some friends online in the
early afternoon and then I said hey
let's let's go to the beach let's watch
the sunset or whatever hopefully it's
not raining it would totally be like it
would be my luck fails raining tomorrow
I said let's go to the beach watch the
sunset and then we can go to Pier Park
it's a shopping outlet kind of on the
beach here and we'll go to the marble
slab I'll take you to get some ice cream
and she's been wanting to go I have we
walk by all the time there but we never
actually go in it's pretty expensive
place but my dude I'll tell her marble
slabs on Luke W I appreciate that dude
and hopefully hopefully stick around you
guys are you guys are awesome let's see
diamond MIT he says check the discord
because the discord has the here I'll
just check it do I have this chord
installed oh I don't have it okay demon
man I will answer that discord question
right now so that I don't miss it I
appreciate the $5 super chat again you
guys like yeah I appreciate it but we're
gonna close it out here so I will check
this chord again if you guys have any
more questions anything you feel like it
wasn't answered you want more specifics
more clarification on stuff I invite you
again to join the public discord below
it is 100% free you don't have to pay
anything at all to join although the
patron members and the channel members
get special perks in the discord channel
if you want to do that if you want to
join but apart from that you can still
ask questions as a regular discord
member so join the discord link down
below shared with Brian from techie city
you guys know Brian you love Brian
brands an awesome dude and we get a lot
of work done over there although it's
been pretty I haven't been on as much as
I have I should have been recently
because of all
stuff I've been doing regarding the
hurricane because the town is still
pretty messed up my parents house is
still pretty messed up so I've been
really busy with that and work here and
Lisa just got here so but I'll be on
again much more here soon so don't worry
you guys just be a little more patient
with me and our patient with me for a
little longer and it will all be good I
appreciate the views I appreciate the
long watches you guys with 227 or so
watching on a Sunday night / Monday
morning or afternoon you guys are
awesome and I know this is kind of a
weird time a weird time of day and a
weird day in general of the week I
appreciate you guys we're gonna call
this one this is science to do
after-hours number 29 thank you guys for
watching and again leave your extra
questions in the discord I will do my
best to go through all of them if
possible and especially especially
thanks to those who super chatted ask
questions questions I don't know the
answers to I will get back to you guys
I'm very soon I'll quit rambling here
now this is science studio thanks for
laughs streaming with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
