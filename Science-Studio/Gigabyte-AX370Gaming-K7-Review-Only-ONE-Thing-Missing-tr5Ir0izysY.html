horas ax 370 gaming k7 and it's
hands-down one of the most stylish and
functional motherboards that I've ever
seen
save one small detail this will be a
short and sweet review first off yes
a.m. for full support for all am 4c
peers including the up-and-coming risin
5 lineup it's also fully RGB functional
and both dedicated surround lighting
sync with complimentary Google Play and
Appstore applications on Sirius you can
actually control this board the heli D
config via your phone welcome to the
future super cool Edition one fan
headers gigabytes included eight of them
with both voltage and PWM control
worried about temperature monitoring
seven of those monitors onboard worried
about audio clarity
how about dedicated rear and front
codecs you've got two channels here for
crystal-clear audio I can confirm and
you'll find that's pretty much the trend
for everything on this board high end
Japanese caps killer Gigabit LAN the
list goes on but enough with spitting
out facts anyone can just look these up
on their own
what are the overclocks like I'm going
to rise in 1700 X here running in tandem
with a six plus four power phase design
that means that only six of those are
dedicated to the CPU and a dedicated
base clock generator for frequencies
ranging anywhere from 100 to 300
megahertz
I was able to hit are you ready for this
4.0 2 gigahertz and it's not that bad
these chips are stubborn as hell past
the upper 3s and in case you're
wondering a multiplier of 39 and a base
clock of 103 was used so much thought
was put into this boards design as well
as its function and that's a good thing
chances are you'll have way more than
you actually need
I mean who the heck needs 2 USB 3.0 hubs
regardless you've got same can be said
for these LEDs by the way he'll find
them here here all over here here and
here there's even a doctor debug down
below great for diagnosing errors we all
know that feeling the feeling of not
knowing what component is to blame for
that catastrophic system failure or a
boot loop or crash or unresponsiveness
yep it's a big help and I'm glad it's
there you'll find other dedicated
buttons up top as well to control
overclocking presets and system power if
you're performing a dry boot good stuff
gigabyte I expected nothing less
both SLI and crossfire are natively
supported as well as clock speeds up to
3200 megahertz but good look getting
there I expect it'll be easier to buy
ram frequencies bios and ms refinements
creep their way into the consumer space
there are a few channels who've managed
to hit that thirty-two hundred megahertz
boundary but yeah that's not mainstream
at this point I'll be working on it
myself to see what I can actually get in
terms of frame rates and just overall
stability with the system the good thing
is with this board
you've got future proofing in mind but
there is one thing that I expected in
this board that gigabyte did not provide
can guess what it is
maybe from this angle can you tell see
it yet
no onboard Wi-Fi card are you kidding me
you pack all this goodness into an ATX
form factor but neglect to stuff a Wi-Fi
card into the mix alright I suppose no
board is truly perfect there's always
some kind of catch price quality design
the gaming k7 gets an A in all of those
categories but I can't give it a perfect
score because I can't hop online on at
least without a cable or a PCI based
Wi-Fi card but do I still recommend the
board hell yeah I do it's one of the
best looking around impacts almost
everything you'll need save the Wi-Fi of
course and I'm sorry I'm making a big
deal of this it's just something that I
expected a flagship motherboard this is
gigabytes invest in the aim for space
and Wi-Fi is kind of a priority for most
people at this point it's just the way
of the future now things are you know
faster wired but still it's nice to have
the wireless connection it doesn't have
it's like having a car but knowing that
you have a problem with the engine or
something that people can't see on the
outside that you just wish was fixed or
which was there but I digress it isn't
even very expensive and that's a good
thing it was more expensive I wouldn't
recommend it top pick in my book and
that's why I'll be using its my upcoming
custom loop build stay tuned for that
tech porn and all the flow modes that
accompany it if you like this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs down
for the opposite be sure to click the
subscribe if you haven't already and
stay tuned for the next video on the
channel I don't know what I'm going to
do tomorrow but I'll do something
this is Salazar studio thanks for
