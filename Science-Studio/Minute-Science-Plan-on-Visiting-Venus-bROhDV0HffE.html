our first installment of minute science
so we're gonna get right to it if you
ever get the chance to visit the planet
Venus don't set your oven to its max
temperature and then multiply that
temperature by two and chances are
that's roughly what the surface of Venus
feels like whatever it feels like inside
that up please don't try that let's say
that you have a spacesuit that can
withstand on how 2 degree temperatures
alright well you've got a patch your
first problems your second problem is
that sulfuric acid is everywhere it's in
the clouds it's in the air it's on the
surface it's literally raining down so
your spacesuit would not only have to
withstand not even Green Fahrenheit
temperatures but it would also have to
withstand corrosion from sulfuric acid
you've got a third problem pressure the
pressure here on earth is about one
atmosphere which is 760 millimeters of
mercury 101.3 kilo Pascal's there are a
lot of different numbers that mean the
same thing well on Venus if we stick to
just the atmospheric scale Venus has
atmospheric pressure of ninety earth
atmospheres which means that the weight
above you from just the the air itself
is ninety times heavier on you that is
right now on earth our bodies here are
acquainted to that we've evolved and
developed under this atmosphere so it's
ok we can handle that but on Venus would
be crushed almost instantly so now we
need a suit that can withstand heat
sulfuric acid and intense pressures this
planet is hostile guys I would advise
going there
the Russians try to do it their
satellite lasts about four minutes
before everything started just falling
apart melting and and just just
corroding it was not a pretty sight and
it was frankly a big waste of time with
a few pictures like this one here that
we manage to have some back to work
so that's familiar to science guys
thanks for checking us out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
