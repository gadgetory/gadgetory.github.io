Craigslist video and I haven't been
reluctant because of the lawsuit I think
that that is just a joke honestly and
I'll comment more on that in a dedicated
video once certain things unfold a lot
of stuffs happened pretty serious stuff
between the last video which you can
check out here and today but I don't
want to talk about any of that until
it's basically all culminated and then
hopefully concluded sooner rather than
later but we'll see I don't want that
though to take away from the fact that I
think I'm still well within my right to
make these videos and that's why this
one here exists now that said the ad in
this video is terrible to say the least
and that's why I think it deserves its
own video because either this seller I'm
gonna assume it to he is delusional or
borderline delusional or he genuinely
thinks that older hardware age is like
fine wine and I have a feeling it's the
latter usually I can sift through the BS
the trolls we're looking for attention
on videos like these this one seems
legit I don't know what you guys think
in the comments below with that said
let's go ahead and jump into it
so this here is the ad you can see the
title says custom-built extreme gaming
computer you know it's going to be a
best-seller when we have extreme in the
title we have 17 pictures to grace our
eyes and I'll tell you about five or six
of them are absolutely atrocious I can't
believe this individual didn't try at
all to cable managed anything
he's got cables running all across his
CPU cooler and everything looks a dusty
it's just not a pleasant sight what I
think is worse is this description
though if he had just neglected to
include any of this crap and left the
pictures in a decent price this thing
would probably already have sold so you
know when they start things off with
four serious gamers only exclamation
mark it's gonna be a pretty intense ad
and then it all caps right underneath
that please read carefully custom-built
gaming computer and tech ATX full Tower
gaming case black steel cooling system
1200 v3 here are the specs condition
used all right thanks for that item type
full tower gaming case brand and tech
this blah blah blah looks like a bunch
of crappy copy and paste it off of some
third-party retailer site this case
alone is almost $3,000 new this right
here has me scratching my head is he
referring to just the case or the build
like the PC in the case including the
case so on the outside asus rog rampage
for black edition LGA 2011 ddr3 AC Wi-Fi
USB 3.0 intel x79 the ATX motherboard
okay you could just say ram pitch for
black extreme okay we can see the
pictures and this individual says that
this motherboard costs almost $1000 so
you know it's a good one folks extreme
engine digi +3 hardcore power delivery
with premium components supreme FX black
amazing 120 decibel signal-to-noise
ratio 600 ohm audio OC panel
overclocking command center VGA hot wire
hot wire your system what am I even
reading
it sounds like I'm at a used car
dealership and I'm being sold on some
tech that you know it's just full of
mumbo-jumbo that actually means nothing
at all on to some actual substance here
Intel Core i7 processor
alright so he's super specific about the
motherboard but he fails to mention the
specifics of the CPU am ia like am i
reading this wrong I am I missing a
chunk of this ad did I skip something
you know I don't think so
so why so specific on the motherboard
like he's trying to sell this whole
build on the premise that the
motherboard is extremely expensive and
the CPU is just it's a core i7 3.7
gigahertz that's all I have to say about
that and then we have the 32 gigs of ram
again not specific he did say 32 gigs so
at least we know how much he's running
in there
he was semi specific about the hard
drives again just the storage but we
don't know the specific brands we don't
know the RPM we have no idea so these
could be crap hard drives for all we
know and then he says nvidia he spelled
that wrong nvidia gio force you see that
folks gio force gtx 760 display adapter
x2 DVD CD ROM drives we have an asus DVD
CD ROM player blu-ray and then we have
another cd-rom right a bowl down below
amsoft virtual sound device he's got a
sound card in there and tell c600 x79
chipset why why is that down here you
should have put that up there with that
huge paragraph talking about your
motherboard will include the following
Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit
in the office 2010 other stuff included
the monitor it's an on 21 inch almost
brand new left look that one up Corsair
gaming keyboard this keyboard is almost
120 dollars new ok we don't care how
much it costs you knew it's not new
anymore
anchor laser gaming mouse gaming
headphones brand new yet never used
I mean that's worth mentioning it's good
that he mentioned that if you never used
it then yeah in my eyes it's probably
new I mean if you open the box I don't
think you should call it new it's
probably new slash open box
he has a is a printer I guess he's
including HP Officejet Pro 69 68 almost
new
and then we have an Altec Lansing I am
l22 seven orbit us me light speaker for
laptops and netbooks okay and then we
get to the juiciest of the juicy
sections of this ad and that is the
asking price see he doesn't put it up
top there's there's no price up there
you got to read the entire ad to figure
out what this guy wants for this thing
and he says he's asking forty nine
ninety five there's no decimal in there
folks that's four thousand nine hundred
ninety five dollars as individuals
asking for this build about wait I
forgot something Oh Bo this has been
researched and value verified
independently of myself for fair value
please only serious offers will be
considered okay so this sentence right
here is a hot load of BS never trust
anybody who says value verified
independently and yeah because I didn't
value verify it on my on my own that
means that the price I'm asking is
totally fair because someone else says
it's fair I could pay my brother five
bucks to say that you know the PC I'm
using right now is worth thirty thousand
dollars it's nowhere close to that but
so what I got it value verified so it's
totally fair now at this point I've got
to say I don't necessarily have a
problem with the way in which the case
is presented apart from the fact that
it's a lot of dust buildup cable
management issues you guys have knocked
on me in the past for knocking on these
people who have terrible cable
management I'm not gonna dive too far
into this it's a quick fix I just wish
that people want who were asking this
much money for a build would clean it up
a bit you know show some respect for the
build you're trying to flip but that
aside I think the the bigger concern
here the moment the more obvious concern
arguably is the fact that this person is
trying to justify extreme and outrageous
prices for extremely used components
first off the idea that this motherboard
here is you know a thousand bucks in
2019 is insane and that's almost exactly
what the sellers trying to do is pass
this off as a thousand dollar board
because there's no other way to justify
the five thousand dollar sum total that
he's got there at the bottom so just a
quick LGA 2011 x79 motherboard search on
ebay and you'll find that these boards
go for anywhere between 100 and 200
bucks on average maybe not specifically
the RAM pitch for but a lot of these
boards have similar features an extreme
chipset and you shouldn't expect much
less in this regard here's something
else
just noticed this guy says that the case
is worth three grand in the description
right now I wasn't sure he was talking
about the entire build or just the case
which would be very very comical and he
actually included a convenient snapshot
of an Amazon listing of this exact case
and then you can see it says new from
twenty six ninety thirty four and free
shipping so because he found this on one
third-party sellers page on Amazon for
close to three grand he thinks he can
get three thousand dollars for it this
this has got to be a joke I I can't see
how somebody could be this dumb frankly
twenty six ninety thirty four for this
case you heard it here folks a bunch of
steel and a couple fans and there you go
there's three grand by the way one of
the reasons why you might see a very
outrageous price for a rather cheap
component just kind of on and off on
sites like Amazon and Newegg is because
of inventory loss so if the seller
doesn't have that product in stock to
sell immediately what they'll do is
they'll raise the price to some
outrageous crazy amount they know no one
would pay so they don't have to remove
the product from the from the the
retailers page from Amazon or new eggs
pages so it's a way to keep things on
the site without having to take it down
and then repost it and then once they
get the item back in stock
they'll just readjust the price down to
the you know more sane amount and then
they can begin selling again again
without having to renew the page and
then of course we can't forget this
graphics card in here the NVIDIA geo
force gtx 760 and then he says display
it after x2 i'm like what he's saying
there's two display adapters like what
kind of display adapters are we talking
about here i don't feel like this person
knows what he's typing i think he's just
trying to copy and paste stuff from
product pages anyway gtx 760 wouldn't
pay more than oh gosh in 2019 maybe
fifty bucks for it i I would say that's
even a stretch I wouldn't buy a 760
really for any modern gaming grade can
get cards that are around a hundred
bucks it'll blow this out of the water
in the used market so 760 is pretty much
obsolete in my book and then the fact
that it's paired with just a I don't
know what kind of i7 but just a nice
the extreme platformer x79 it just
doesn't make much sense again in this
day and age it looks like the CPU cooler
is kind of beefy it looks like the power
supply is satisfactory but I mean
there's so much crap in front of all of
us that I can't really see the
components specifics now like the whole
ordeal here with the used market is that
prices are subjective the value that you
inherently see in a component or an
entire build is all in your head it's
what you think that build is worth and
your money is ultimately the determinant
how much of it you fork over for said
component I can say a lot about your
preferences about your desires how badly
you want something maybe the supply and
demand if there's not a lot of supply
out there of a particular good then
you're probably gonna pay more for it
because you don't come across that stuff
every day the notion that a case is
suddenly worth $3,000 because again a
retailer marked it up to near $3,000
because they ran out of inventory and
didn't want to retract the posting is
just a bit insane that's not how markets
work anywhere it doesn't matter if
you're a capitalist or socialist or
communist or anything of the sort just
because a retailer says it's worth 3
grand
does not mean that it's worth 3 grand ok
maybe in a communist or socialist
economy if government says it's worth
something and they mandate a price I
guess you can't really argue with that
but in a capitalistic one that's not how
it works if I wanted to sell my car for
$100,000 but I only paid 20 grand for it
I'm gonna be rich really fast and I'm
gonna rip somebody off big time now that
said I don't think that the seller has
an ominous intent behind this posting
and what I mean by that is I don't think
the seller is trying to rip somebody off
for thousands of dollars literally by
conning them and making them you know
think something about a build is true
when in fact it is very far from the
truth I think that the seller is just so
blatantly misinformed and so out of
touch with reality that they think their
system is actually worth that that it's
worth more than they paid for because I
know they paid way less for it than what
they're trying to sell it for now
inflation is not accounting for that big
of a gap
I might be totally wrong but you should
stay away from this ad that's my
professional opinion because this person
is asking way more than I would ever pay
for it I would say five six hundred
bucks and that's I mean that's assuming
that the i7 is not a really expensive i7
because they didn't specify and when
they don't specify I assume the worst
because why else would you be vague so
yeah what do you guys think about this
one let me know in the comments below if
you liked the video thumbs up you know
what to do
giving videos like these and thumbs up
helps me a lot it lets me gauge audience
interaction and appreciation for a topic
and if the ratios you know if I have
like an 80% like ratio maybe I could
have done a better job what can I do
differently let me check the comments so
it kind of is an indicator of
performance and preference and it does
really help so I'd be sure to like or
dislike depending on your preference how
you felt about this one and also don't
be shy link your own craigslist ads that
you find doesn't have to be on
Craigslist could be off route could be
Facebook marketplace just something that
you find online that is not a great deal
and I might throw it into a future video
like this one guys but awesome I will
catch with the next one this design
studio thanks for watching and thanks
for cringing
