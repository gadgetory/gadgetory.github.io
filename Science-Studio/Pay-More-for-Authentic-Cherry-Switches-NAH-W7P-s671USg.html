shapes and sizes but we're focusing on
mechanical switches in this video the
four most common types all denoted by
color red blue black and brown they're
all slightly different by design each
with a different user and preference in
mind blues are generally the most
tactile and consequently the loudest
while Reds on the other end of the
spectrum are much quieter and require
little to no force for activation most
people claim that it just comes down to
here's my favorite word preference
gamers should consider it reds or blacks
and typist should most definitely
consider blues or on a few cases Browns
Browns are typically a fair middle
ground
my favorite switches are blues for both
typing and gaming I love the tactile
feedback and appreciate the actuation
force required but what about when it
comes to different manufacturers there
are multiple companies who produce
mechanical keys most of us know of
cherry a german-american peripheral
manufacturer they design and produce
these kinds of colored mechanical keys
and are highly regarded all other
switches for the most part are
considered knockoffs and are compared to
Cherry MX switches as the sort of
standard I'm pitting Cherry MX blue
switches in today's video against Altima
blue switches both are designed almost
the same but when it comes to keystrokes
subtle design differences can mean big
differences for the user I'll give you
my impressions of using both the first
player fire rose sporting Ottomans which
I reviewed right here and the new
g.skill km 570 a fairly affordable
keyboard from g.skill sporting authentic
cherry blues I chose to compare blues
because they're my favorite kind of
switch and I expect I'll be more
sensitive to tiny changes overall let's
start off first with how each one sounds
testing testing ok that's my voice from
about a foot away from the blue Yeti and
the keyboard is a little under a foot
away from from the top of the Yeti but
we will be keeping this here and we'll
just swap the keyboard for the G scale
km 570 after we run our first test with
this one here so let's see I guess the
goal here would be to to be the quietest
despite the fact that both of these are
blue switches I expect that one of these
will be quieter than the other I kind of
already have an idea which which
keyboard will come out on top in that
regard so let's go ahead and start
typing
and we'll do a sound comparison alright
so now I have the 570 right here in
front of me I haven't inclined it or
anything like that
so it's pretty much the same distance
away from the blue Yeti as the fire rose
keyboard was and let's go ahead and
start typing I'm going to type the exact
same thing I type previously by the way
so here
you'll hear the same amount of clicks
unless I mess something up in the
process this is something I did not
expect now in terms of just how loud
each one sounds I think that the km 570
comes out on top
authentic Cherry MX blue switches are
considerably quieter than their I guess
off-brand counterparts these are altima
blue switches here but in most cases the
authentic keys are going to be a bit
quieter even though they are the loudest
in terms of you know the fact that
they're blues so not they're not Browns
or Reds and those are all going to sound
different and the off-brand versions of
those are going to sound different as
well but for this keyboard here even
though it's sporting authentic cherry
blues I noticed that it's not as tactile
as the autumn accounter part and we
explain what I mean by that so there's a
definite actuation point blues are very
popular because they do have a very very
specific point at which actuation occurs
that's the point at which the key is
engaged and the computer registers the
keystroke so if I push this key down
past a certain point enough weight will
be on the key to actuate it and when
that happens you do hear that click you
do feel the click it is responsive but
when I hop over to something like the
autumn ablute here the click is just
more defined there isn't as much weight
required by the key to push it down to
right above the actuation point and then
when you finally get there on this
keyboard it's just it's not as it
doesn't feel as satisfying it almost
feels mushy not like a membrane keyboard
we're not even close to that but it
doesn't feel as clicky that's that's
really the only way I know how to
explain it something like this just
feels you just know okay so I've pulled
the key caps off of both switches and
this way we can get an idea of just how
different the actual keys are themselves
and not the key caps and how they
interfere with the the rest of the key
so when I push down the authentic Cherry
MX switch definite point of actuation
but you can't really hear it okay so
that's what I want you to pay attention
to at this point try to listen for the
actuation point you'll hear that loud
click sound that's iconic with blue
switches
okay that's with the Cherry MX now we're
going to over here to the autumn ablute
which
you can almost get an idea for how
tactile each of these is just by
listening to how each response so I'm
going to alternate between the G scale
and the fire rose keys here something
else I notice is that it actually
requires more force to actuate the
Cherry MX key than it does for the
autumn ooh blue key
there isn't a substantial difference but
it's definitely noticeable and I think
that's what makes this keyboard seem a
bit mushy er I'm actually pushing harder
on each key so I don't feel just the
subtle click sound I'm actually pushing
the key harder past that actuation
points so it seems mushy er overall
because the key requires more force to
actuate now this does almost completely
come down to preference you might prefer
the Cherry MX blue switch but if you ask
me and a lot of you might disagree with
me a lot of you probably will disagree
with me I prefer typing in the case of
blue switches here with the off-brand
keyboard the reason why is because it
requires less force for actuation per
key which means that I can type this is
just coming from my own experience here
I can type more words per minute on this
keyboard than I can on this one this one
requires more force per key actuation
and that just takes away from my ability
to type more words per minute again you
may respond differently to this style
keyboard this might be better for you
you might be able to type more words per
minute with this keyboard than this one
but if we're looking at just how each
key responds to a keystroke this one is
just a district wires less energy I
guess is what I should say here and
because it requires less energy I can
waste less time typing each letter or
number whatever I'm doing and as a
result I can type more words and I can
just well it just doesn't feel as stray
Gnaeus on my fingertips it I can just
glide over each key whereas in this case
I'm pushing harder I don't feel as
satisfied when I push the key because
the actuation isn't as distinct even
though it does sound better and it does
sound quieter that's a trade-off I'm
willing to make for the sake of typing
more words per minute there you have it
not what you expected was it to be
completely honest I'd almost prefer
Cherry Browns over cherry blues just
because they're brown
actuation forces similar to those found
on autumn abused it becomes very clear
once you begin typing with both
keyboards at the same time it's a weird
feeling but there's a distinct
difference here one I can't relate via
video but you'll have to experience
first hand to fully understand if you're
interested in purchasing either of the
keyboards I've tested you can find their
links in this video's description or you
can just click the car that I revealed a
bit earlier if you like this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you do feeling a bit
opposite or if you hate everything about
life be sure to click the subscribe but
if you have already to stay tuned for a
