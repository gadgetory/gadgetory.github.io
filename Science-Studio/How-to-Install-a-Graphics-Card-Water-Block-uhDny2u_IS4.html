right into the meat of this video I have
right here a reference PCB 1080 TI from
accelerate to card which I've reviewed
in a video right here we're going to
place the stock air cooler for a thermal
take water block this is an acrylic
block with a copper base similar to the
ones I use in Andromeda for the 1080 s
in there and this is a course compatible
with the reference TI PCB it's a pretty
straightforward process you'll see that
wells coming up right now so pretty much
the only thing we're going to need for
this entire teardown and replacement
process is a small tool kit now I
recommend having some Torx screws in
here some very small ones just in case
you never know with your particular card
if we want to do customization Torx
screws would come in handy but I think
just for the regular teardown process a
few sets of small Phillips heads will be
sufficient maybe a flathead here or
there just to help pry things up need be
I don't expect what this card will have
much difficulty at all so moving the
cooler and of course everything else
that we're going to need for the
replacement process is included in
Thermaltake TI box now before we even
touch what is inside this box we're
going to need to tear down the air
cooler take it off stripped everything
down to just the circuit board I
recommend getting a good look for what
we're going to need to remove starting
first with what it looks like these four
screws holding in the air cooler itself
these surround the GPU usually so it
looks like yeah just that four screws
hold it's the entire air cooler in place
also bear in mind that you will have
probably two or three fan cables to
disconnect as you're removing the cooler
from the circuit board by the way a
magnetic screwdriver comes in very handy
and instances like these alright so
those four screws are off now let's see
if we can there we go
well queue the bit of force sometimes
the stock thermal paste is a bit sticky
so don't pull too hard you might have a
screw that's still holding things
together but if you have everything off
you're sure about and just kind of give
it a gentle nudge and there you go in
this case the entire air cooler is
removed with a simple four screws now at
this point you want to use preferably a
lint-free cloth to remove the stock
thermal compound from the GPU die I'm
using toilet paper that's just because I
don't have a lift free cloth around at
this point it
it's okay you're going to have just ten
Yule microfibers everywhere then you're
also going to want some isopropyl
alcohol preferably 90% or above and
maybe something like a q-tip to get the
small crevices around the die try to
remove as much of the stock thermal
compound as possible prepping it for the
new compound we're going to apply here
in a second
undo maybe a little something that right
there and you can take the q-tip and
roll it around and there get it soaked
up as much as possible then we're going
to clean the die
should look nice and shiny when it's all
set done once the die is clean and dry
use your own thermal compound thermal
take includes their own so that's what
we're going to do here no matter what
you do with this pattern you're always
going to get chopped somewhere in the
comments so whatever I'll make it look
like that no way a bunch of people will
have reason to complain again though as
long as it's covering the whole thing by
the time you sandwich the cooler on it's
okay if you had a little too much it'll
be fine you'll be good to go from a
thermal perspective get it because it's
thermal take by the way we're not down
to the bare PCB at this piece right here
needs to be removed as well as the
backplate although I guess in this case
you could leave the backplate on it's
not really hurting anything
but for the sake of consistency here you
might have a backplate that is
incompatible with your acrylic blocks
we're going to go ahead and remove it
all okay there's the backplate no longer
needed and it looks like the last thing
we need to remove here is the heatsink
over the v RMS and MOSFETs okay this is
taking a bit of force and be careful
though there we go so there's just a
bunch of thermal pads on the backside
sometimes you get sticky just like the
stock thermal compound will so just be
careful not to bend the board or break
anything on the board in the removal
process so that's it this is the bare
1080 TI reference PCB nothing else on
here except what belongs on the circuit
board itself so with that we can go
ahead and open up the box that thermal
tie gave us support from what I already
pulled out which was just the included
little tool driver here and a thermal
compound everything else in the box we
now need so what you'll get in this
thermal tape kit function manuals this
is the back plate really nice that they
include one of those underneath the
course remember you get the the driver
as well as
the thermal compound you also get a
couple of these G quarter-inch caps and
the screw set a bunch of thermal pads
and lastly the acrylic block check out
how beautiful this thing is I love the
way it looks especially on camera
you guys are getting while I'm doing
y'all such a solid right now check that
out and here is the copper base
underneath with a nickel plating now the
next step according to the manual we
want to place thermal pads here here
here these are the vram modules by the
way and then back here over the mosfet
so we need to cut these down to size you
can just do this by hand just kind of
eyeball it it's okay if it hangs a
little over just make sure that you're
covering everything lay one down right
there our second one right here in front
our third ones going here so this is an
11 gigabyte card right so 11 gigs of
VRAM so each module is a one gig module
so we have four eight nine ten there's a
blank here would be twelve but this is
the GP one or two card
there's the eleventh one now very mine
we do still have the plastic on the tops
here we'll take these off once we
prepare the acrylic block okay there's
our next one and the manual says the
last piece needs to be right here a bit
thinner okay there we go that's it just
pull off these plastic tops try not to
touch these with your bare hands you'll
get oils on them and that will impede
the ability for these pads to transfer
heat okay time for the merge at this
point go ahead and take your acrylic
block now align the cutouts in the
acrylic itself with the caps on the
board if you can use the eight pin six
pin as well depends on the board that
you have but you should use things that
are cut out in the acrylic to align it
properly just kind of set it on there
Jimmy this is a pretty heavy block most
of them will be hold the block in place
once it's aligned flip it over be
careful don't let the block fall when
it's upside down take ten plastic washer
and then one of the screws with the
springs included and I'll align that up
as best you can screw it in place and
there you go the block should be
relatively stable at this point is kind
of a two-man job because you have to
hold the acrylic block up you also have
to somehow
guy to screw into that hole that first
one's always difficult but once you get
past that first one the blocks pretty
much in place just set the other screws
and where they belong
and you'll have a secure acrylic block
and there's number four all right four
screws around the GPU check now the rest
of these threads are here for added
stability don't miss a single one of
them where you'll have a sagging water
block definitely not good okay now the
rest of these threads this one here here
here here here and here are for the
backplate so we're going to install the
backplate next this part is pretty
straightforward just match up the
threads and you should be good to go now
it doesn't have any thermal properties
so it will get hot but it won't pull
Heat specifically away from vital
components on the board nonetheless it
is still nice that thermal tape included
one and there you go that is literally
the entire installation process again
not very complicated I don't even use
the manual anymore because it's pretty
straightforward with any block that you
use some will have special wiring
instructions I'm going to be installing
a fan text block onto a TI here soon
that comes with included LED kits and
whatnot but this right here is just a
pretty straightforward rudimentary water
block all we're going to need now let's
check out some thermals now disclaimer I
did not yet install the 1080 TI water
block into a custom loop it's a lot of
work to do that so I'm saving that for a
separate video but this is a 1080 just a
regular 1080 water block before and
after install so the first temperature
you're seeing here in yellow the sixty
nine degree low temperature was with a a
CX 3.0 EVGA cooler on the car so just an
air cooler and then when we swap that
for the thermal take 1080 block those
temperatures lowered under load 261
degrees Celsius something else important
to note the idle temperatures did not
change at all and this is because I
recorded idle temperatures after the low
temperature so you don't get really true
idle temps until after you've let things
settle down after a pretty long day of
intensive tasks and those temperatures
love it all for both the air cooler and
the liquid cooler at 28 degrees Celsius
apiece this mind you is with a single
360 millimeter AIO for the thermal tape
block and just the regular stock fan rpm
settings full
or the EVGA cooler now keep in mind that
eight degree Delta doesn't seem all that
compelling especially when you consider
the price of a full-on custom loop can
cost upwards of $2,000 for a full custom
loop PC build and that's just in the
custom Lib gear alone depending on how
fancy you want to get with it so I don't
want you to look at just the
temperatures to kind of rationalize this
custom loops are always going to be a
bit excessive they're not going to be
the best price per dollar thing you can
do with your PC but another factor to
consider is sound when you custom cool a
graphics card apart from the fluid
actually moving through the card which
you won't really hear unless you put
your ear right up next to it a custom
cooled card is pretty much inaudible
whereas if you had an air-cooled card
things would get pretty loud as you put
that graphics card under load now that's
not to say the custom loop pcs can't be
loud it depends on your fan curve
settings depends on how big your
radiator is how big your fans are and
your overclocks but generally speaking
you can move the sound away from your
graphics card to somewhere else in your
system and typically lower your fan
curve to that of a much more tolerable
rpm the addition of this point still
won't justify the price ultimately of a
custom loop PC but for those who have
already set aside the money who are
determined to spend that much on custom
gear heck you can make pretty
awesome-looking pcs with custom loop
parts then installing a graphics card
waterblock is pretty much mandatory
unless you just want to cool your cpu in
which case I don't really see the point
all that much unless you just want it to
look cool and you want really stellar
CPU overclocks but you're not worried
about your graphics cards but it's a
gaming PC you should 9 times out of 10
cool your graphics cards - in which case
this video would come in handy for most
of you if you liked this video by the
way be sure to give it a thumbs up
thumbs down for the opposite click
subscribe but if you haven't already now
we'll catch you in the next video we're
going to be reviewing a gigabyte ITX
arisin motherboard looks really cool and
it won't break the bank it's also a
small form factor this is signed studio
