thought PC games as just supplement to
that whole experience that was it
nothing more consoles offer a unique
home theater entertainment experience
unlike any other for the price some
would argue others of course like many
of you who watch this channel feel the
complete opposite many of you feel that
even a cheap HTPC can offer competitive
advantages over console counterparts I
don't blame you and I make no secret of
my current bias however maybe the
speculation will pull you closer toward
the center just what will comprise the
Xbox Scorpio this next-gen console
brings quite a bit to the table nothing
new in the PC sphere by any means but
enough on the other side to potentially
boost market share man perhaps enough to
convince some of you to do the same so
what about Scorpio makes it so
compelling primarily it's 4k gaming
potential merged with a next-gen console
price which I expect to land around four
hundred US dollars any more than about
450 in Microsoft risks losing a great
deal of its current fan base for
comparison sake I built a modern 4k
capable gaming PC and a PC part picker
list in this video's description it's
actually very similar to the ITX PC I
built here instructional included I just
swapped the aim the Ark's 480 for a gtx
1070 a 1070 is capable of some moderate
4k gaming with triple-a titles and if
you have at least an i5 to back up those
frames you'll be a-ok the pcs form
factor will mimic the Xbox ones as well
here the cost approaches one thousand US
dollars but they're on Scorpios end the
cost will likely be significantly lower
granted these are aimed at different
markets specifications for the most part
are unknown but we're confident in an
eight-course CPU and dedicated graphics
unit capable of get this six teraflops
of floating-point performance that's gtx
1070 territory and while t flop values
are not exact representations of
graphical performance they do bring a
great deal of insight into
cross-platform potential and well
optimised titles and if there's one
thing we in the PC gaming sphere can
admit about consoles it's that their
titles are beautifully optimized it
makes sense right there's only one kind
of Xbox 360 Xbox one def know exactly
how to take full advantage of onboard
hardware because it never
Changez at least within that particular
generation memory bandwidth at 320
gigabytes per second only further pushes
a narrative of powerful computer Aphex
and reveals the possibility of gddr5
ex-something videos GT X 1080 boasts as
well and that's a $600 graphics card on
its own I say that to save this and take
it with a grain of salt the six
teraflops Microsoft themselves are
purporting on their website might as
well be eight or nine teraflops and PC
gaming terms just from an optimization
standpoint alone 4k gaming piece of cake
now let's discuss the other half of this
equation the eighth course central
processor we know it will have eight
physical cores because it says so right
here and Xbox ret supposted on social
media that the Scorpio met they're
exceedingly high expectations during the
testing phase how about AMD Zen cores
both Microsoft and Sony of championed
AMD processors in the past and it would
honestly come as no surprise that
Microsoft chose them again with a cheeky
contract in an effort to spearhead the
new architecture and place the red team
back on the map this of course is widely
speculated but a few hints have me
feeling this way safely namely the
mentioning of project Scorpio at the AMD
rise and boost this year at CES seems
too obvious and deliberate to be a
coincidence
at this point however I must digress
there are much more recent claims from
inside sources that the CPU inside
Scorpio isn't capable of native 60 FPS
gameplay it might be a 30fps
video up sampled if you will to 60fps
which tells me that it's probably not
horizon CPU because you would think that
a rising CPU would would be capable of
60fps this is all speculation it might
just end up boasting an eight-core
Jaguar CPU that's overclocked just a bit
more than the Xbox one others will
disagree that's what the comments
section is for Microsoft is also
promising backwards compatibility with
the Xbox one something that undoubtedly
cut into the one sales back in 2013 Wow
was it that long ago the release date
for the Scorpio by the way quote-unquote
holiday 2017 likely during the month of
November history serves me correctly now
wrapping up what we know and can safely
extrapolate from the provided console
specifications the Scorpio will be
around four times more powerful than the
Xbox one pack nearly five times
rhe bandwidth and four times the gaming
resolution seems compelling enough but
here comes the cliche phrase only time
will tell now you have my permission to
commence an all-out war in the comments
section below if you like this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
life you should click a subscribe but if
you haven't already in stay tuned for
other stuff that I've got planned here
