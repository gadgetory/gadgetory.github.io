about building custom pcs Franklin
design was not the first case
manufacturer that I looked toward I was
more into the flamboyant ostentatious
cases that just kind of caught your eye
from a different perspective and just
made you look at it because it looks so
weird and out there fractal cases have
always been subdued and that is what I
have learned to love about them
the fractal define s was perhaps one of
their biggest successes because it
allowed users to throw whatever they
wanted into the case they had plenty of
room left over and cable management was
an absolute dream the factor to find C
which I reviewed inadvertently in the
video right here manages to keep the
same cable management standard but
includes a basement and a shorter
profile overall and now we've come to
the fractal design mesh if I see this is
still based on the defined C chassis it
still has the same basement it still has
the same removable top panel for custom
cooling compatibility but pumps down
here whatever you really want and it
also has improved upon some of the air
flow qualities that restricted the
defined C it's a beautiful case upfront
and I think that it's priced well it
also includes a tempered glass side
panel let's talk about it what I like
about it what I really like about it and
what I think they could improve upon in
the next gen right off the bat yes this
is a tempered glass case much like the
newly released defined C tempered glass
Edition but this is its own case because
they changed a few things about it that
well might appeal to some might not
appeal to others it really depends on
what you're going for with your build
that's what videos like these are going
to be for the first and most obvious
difference between this case and the
defined C is the fact that this case has
a mesh front panel and specify C this
will be great for those who want to
mount radiators up front even just a fan
configuration it will allow for smooth
airflow through these front little slits
you won't have that restricted and a
side panel airflow pattern that the
defined C had this front panel is also
tessellated quite a bit which gives it a
bit more texture looks a bit more
dynamic up front than just a solid front
panel and it is completely meshed out so
if you want air to flow through the
front
put a couple fans up there and you
should have a problem airflow at all
you'll also find a fractal design logo
toward the bottom left the front panel
is also a bit more difficult to remove
and you'll find that the front io port
have been integrated into the front
panel so be careful when you remove this
you'll have to mind the cables that are
attached up top in terms of front io
you'll find the exact same configuration
here exists as was on the C reset switch
microphone jack headphone jacks power
button and two USB 3.0 ports at the very
top you'll find a single mesh magnetic
dust filter now this is the only thing
included up top you do not get the mod
you vent so this actually was packaged
separately with the defined C when it
shipped but here you only get the mesh
dust filter I guess that's good though
if you're looking for maximizing airflow
this is really all you need other
improvements that in my opinion the
measure by C has over its defined C
counterpart or black PCIe slot covers
instead of white ones which I don't know
why they've been using light for the
longest time and now they're black which
is good fractal has a I guess improve
that in a sense and then the fans that
are now included there are two included
with the metruff I see both 120s have
black fins instead of white ones you'll
find that the case is supported by four
large sturdy rubberized feet just like
the defined C and the same large dust
filter that spans the entire base
fractals also stuck with the same PSU
mounting system you'll find the bracket
they kind of ripped off from NZXT here
although it only uses two thumb screws
in this case vs. four very easy to use
simply mount it to your power supply and
then slide your power supply and do the
back use the two thumb screws to secure
it in place
rubber grounded cutouts everywhere as
usual and a hard drive cage down below
which is removable that includes two
hard drive brackets I'm a huge fan of
this SSD tray behind the motherboard
shroud a simple thumb screw removes it
install the SSD config to your liking
and then reinsert it I think it's an
excellent use of otherwise wasted space
look airflow design with the mesh fic
has drastically improved over the
defined C I speak from experience there
what hasn't changed which is good in
this case is the cable management setup
so the back of the case is identical to
defined tape you're familiar with that
case at all you'll find that cable
management in this case is a dream as it
was with the defined C as it also was
with the
is every full and midsize tower on the
market should follow suit with this
design it makes these cases such a
breeze to build and if you know fractal
design you know that cable management is
a top priority this is one of the
easiest cases to build in hands down off
to the far left you'll find fractals
supreme cable measurement technology
here so this back panel is actually
bumped in a little bit for extra cable
management space I think all cases like
I said should do this and you also have
included velcro straps to keep those
cables where they should be but the
compact nature of the mesh fic which was
also in a way the Achilles heel of the
defined C is extremely Hardware limiting
you can see this even just from that
camera angle there there's only about an
inch for the space between the endless
graphics card and the beginning of the
to 40 mil a IO and this is a reference
PCB so third-party coolers with
third-party PCBs on them might extend a
bit further toward the front of the case
that's a serious concern for the metruff
I see a way you can get around this with
the define C is by putting maybe your
fans in front of the chassis but behind
the front panel that would restrict
airflow but it was better than not being
able to stick your graphics card into
your PC that's actually what I've had to
do with my defined C custom loop builds
I've had to put the fans between the
front panel and the beginning of the
chassis and then I rest the radiator
just behind the front of the chassis so
that gives me a bit more space for my
water cooling tubes to run up from the
basement and also gives me a bit more
breathing room for the 1080s I have in
the current build but if I wanted to
throw the exact same custom loo config
into the mesh if I see it wouldn't
happen is there's no way that it would
work I couldn't run the tubing first off
between like I probably could but it'd
be really cutting it close
between the graphics card and the
radiator I also could move these fans
here into the front panel compartment
because it's really about I'd say a
centimeter of space between the front
panel and where the chassis begins just
because they have an integrated dust
filter in here and kind of a mesh metal
sheen on the very front it's really the
only serious concern I have with this
case they've improved everything that
defines C was lacking including air flow
but they've compromised hardware
compatibility to an extent so if you
want to throw a 240ml AIO in here and
a custom graphics card say something
that's not reference for one then you're
going to have to really pay close
attention to the length of your video
card how much space you're gonna have
between that and the radiator
you could try mounting the radiator fan
config up top there is room for two 140
s or to 120 fans and their radiator
counterparts but I'm not sure you could
fit a radiator I guess no no you'd be
cutting it close you would certainly
block off part of your motherboard and
I'm not sure if the heat things here
would interfere with the radiator either
it's just something to consider hardware
compatibility it's restricted here I'd
say it's restricted by about 30-40
percent the defined C was already
restricted but they managed to work
around via the kinks by giving you more
space in the front panel here not the
case at all the last thing I'm going to
complain about only because this is a
subjective video really it's just going
to come down to what you want and your
build I'm not a huge fan of the extra
tinted tempered glass it looks not that
tinted because I have this huge light
panel here that's kind of shining
through it but this is a rather dark
tempered glass panel and I kind of find
that it defeats the purpose of having a
tempered glass panel in general it
becomes rather difficult to see what's
inside so you're going to need a ton of
LED strips in there just other RGB can
fix to illuminate what is on the inside
otherwise you're going to have to really
squint to see what's inside or shine a
bright LED panel like I've got here into
the case it's foam-padded not going to
rattle or anything of that sort it's
also got rubber mounts so it's designed
well and it's implemented well
especially from a company that hasn't
done tempered glass and typical cases
like this before but the tint is just
it's a little too much for me I think
that the p400s was probably as far as I
would go along a tint line I think that
NZXT s340 elite to their white version I
don't know if the black version is the
same I think it is that tint is the best
tint in my opinion just very slight you
can see everything inside regardless of
whether you've got things lit up in here
or not that's the way a tempered glass
panel should be this here with the
expert int it's just I don't know it
feels kind of cheap so that's my review
of the fractal design mesh if I see I
was honestly prepared to give this my
favorite case of the Year award I think
that this is a true
contender against the s340 elite and the
p400s tge
the only problems here like I've
mentioned the tent on the tempered-glass
isn't all that appealing to me and I
think that this case could be maybe an
inch longer for the extra video card and
a i/o compatibility maybe even custom
loop compatibility this case would look
also by the custom loop in it but it's
going to be really difficult to pull it
off if I put the reservoir on the bottom
or the top and I don't know I don't know
how you're going to fit a radiator and
fans up in the front with a standard
video card link that's just I'm not
seeing that happening right now I'm also
going to define C tge in the video
description I think that's a true
contender over this one if airflow
optimization isn't your thing then I
don't really think you should consider
the measure by C you're going to be okay
o2 config like this but custom loop
compatibility is going to favor the
define C at the expense of airflow yes I
can attest to that personally but this
case is restrictive it really is so I'm
going to link that case in the
description also can review the defined
C tge in a dedicated video and then give
my final decree as to whether I think
that case is the best all-around midsize
tower on the market look at an ideal
world I would say that the define s with
a basement would be the best case
overall but I would be willing to
compromise the extra length Forge the
more compact style I think this is a
pretty good style here and keep the
basement ads I think that the defined C
is a pretty nice middle ground for most
people and the tempered glass is just
the icing on the cake but if you like
this case maybe like this video be sure
to give this one a thumbs up I do
