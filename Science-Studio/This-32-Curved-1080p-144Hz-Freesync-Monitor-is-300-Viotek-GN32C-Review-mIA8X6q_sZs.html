curved 32 inch 1080p 144 Hertz free sync
integrated gaming monitor and guess what
it only costs 300 US dollars so this
video is actually gonna be pretty short
and sweet not because I want to be lazy
okay maybe because I do want to be a
little lazy but also because it's very
difficult to emulate how good this panel
actually looks in person via video so to
start things off this is a VA panel
which stands for vertical alignment it's
similar in architecture to an IPS
display which I talked about in detail
by the way in this video right here
check that out for more information on
the technical side of things but in a
nutshell VA is gonna be somewhat of a
middle ground between IPS and maybe TN
it does have a few compromises color
reproduction isn't the best of the
screen is fairly bright on this display
and the contrast ratios are pretty
incredible for this not being an oled
display one of the best selling points
of the g + 32 C I have to say has got to
be the free sync technology integration
I think that's a pretty sweet bargain
and a $300 monitor also the 144 Hertz
refresh rate so you're gonna have super
smooth pictures super smooth gaming
experiences and you'll also free sink in
there if you have an AMD graphics card
to make things even more buttery smooth
as for build quality I've got to say
it's a lot like other $300 monitors what
you should expect in this price range
it's very plasticy all the way around
although I will say that the frame and
the base of the monitor the monitor
stand those are both very rigid and the
installation process actually super
simple just four screws and you should
be ready to go as for the picture
quality and build in general I don't see
any dead pixels that's a good thing the
response time for milliseconds sub
virtually no ghosting at all like I said
the contrast ratios here are going to be
pretty stellar for a non OLED display
again VA is one of the advantages of
having that technology there is a
20,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio so blacks
are gonna look very black on this
display the white balance a little often
needed to calibrate it just a little bit
you can see here next to my Asus TN
panel the monitor on the left that's the
vo-tech monitor a bit bluer than normal
and honestly my Asus monitor is just a
bit
weren't red than normal probably should
fix that I own the back of the panel we
have a DVI port HDMI 1.4 port and
DisplayPort now the importance of HDMI
1.4 here means that we can send 1080p
144 Hertz signals to the monitor via an
HDMI cable so you don't have to just use
that a DVI or DisplayPort in this case
all three should work as long as your
cable satisfactory and you're actually
you know outputting that many frames to
your monitor I haven't actually tinkered
with the on screen display yet so let's
see easy that is to do so I saw a few
people online complaining about this in
the reviews but selecting the different
inputs it's pretty straightforward I
actually really like this display here
it's very big it's easy to navigate
through so if I want to choose whatever
HDMI works you just Gunter and there you
go of course I only have HDMI plugged in
so there's that also the three things
that you get in the Box other than just
the monitor and the stand are the course
power cable the HDMI 1.4 cable and the
user manual of course though everything
set up wise is pretty straightforward so
you shouldn't need the manual as for the
integrity of the monitor like I said no
dead pixels on the display the backlight
bleed is pretty consistent and minimal
throughout especially in those dark lit
situations I will say there is one tiny
imperfection physically on the monitor
it's down here by this plastic frame so
this actually sticks out just slightly
on one side more so than it does on the
other on the opposite side of the
vo-tech logo I only notice this when I
was slouching down because I was like if
I can see more of just the the black
part of the panel underneath here then I
can on this side and that's because the
plastic isn't all the way pressed
against the display I don't know if
that's just a production issue or just
this individual unit but it's not too
concerning I've got to say though what a
steal at roughly 300 bucks for this
panel the fact that it has free sync
integration the fact that it's a curved
1080p display and 144 earth refresh rate
packed into it all for that price is
pretty sweet the one thing I do want to
talk about though before in this video
is the screen size with respect to the
resolution I discussed this topic in
detail in this video right here but
there is an optimal viewing distance for
this particular screen size and this
resolution at roughly 32 inches
diagonally at 1080p resolution you will
see pixels at roughly two feet away and
that's you know anywhere between two and
three feet is where most gamers will
find themselves if they're sitting in
front of their desk playing video games
or surfing the web or the like so this
is really pushing it for most people who
are concerned about seeing pixels you
will definitely notice pixels on this
display just because it is so large I
would say the optimal screen size for
this kind of display for 1080p I
wouldn't really go higher than about 27
inches 32 is a bit big this is more like
a TV pixel density more so than a gaming
monitor pixel density several pros and
cons associated with this gaming monitor
but this is a $300 gaming monitor you
get expect compromises in a panel like
this the question that was whether or
not those compromises justify the 300 or
so dollar price tag as for me the only
thing I'd like to see change in this
monitor is the resolution 1440p would be
the sweet spot for a 32 inch display and
I would keep the curve expect just
because hey check out my monitor it's
curved
even though doesn't really do much at
least for me some people swear by curved
monitors you get that like kind of
immersive experience but I'm not really
seeing it here and I haven't seen it
with other curved monitors it's just
something that I guess is preferential
I've got this monitor and other vo-tech
displays linked in the video description
if you want to check some of those out
let me know if you have one similar to
this that you like to comment about in
the comment section below I'd like to
know your opinions on this monitor in
particular as for via tech as a company
I'd say they make pretty decent products
based on what I've seen so far with
their GN 32c pretty solid display no
real physical defects for the most part
and just it's a beautiful display for
the price I'd say best bang for the buck
right here in a 32 inch curved display
