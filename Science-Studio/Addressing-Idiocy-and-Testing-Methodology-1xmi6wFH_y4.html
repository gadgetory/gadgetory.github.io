to do that little sit-down intro I've
seen other people do it and I don't know
I just have weird opinions about it
anyway I want to talk to you guys in
this video about testing methodology
because I get a lot of questions
especially aftercooler reviews like the
one we just published yesterday you can
check it out right here if you haven't
already and I want to talk specifically
about why I test what I test the
configurations in which I test and then
address some super weird comments
because there are always a few of those
so I guess I'll go ahead and sort off
with a weird kind of idiotic comment
that I received yesterday and it was
followed up by more moronic and idiotic
comments by the same person in the same
thread which is disappointing because
most idiots are convinced that they're
right which makes it even worse so this
person says there is no point of testing
coolers on CPU that isn't soldered so
sorry but this test is worth exactly
nothing he's referring to our dark rock
slim burst to 12 black edition review
that is what temp is exact on both I
thought that you are more acknowledged
not to make such rookie mistakes okay so
when I posted this on Twitter a few of
you were quick to point out the the
flawed English look I don't know where
this guy's from I'm assuming it's a guy
but I don't know what his native
language is you know he might be in the
first year of English and if that's the
case that's really impressive like yeah
he got some words wrong I misspelled a
few things but that's really good for
someone who doesn't speak English
natively who did doesn't learn that
language upfront you know when they're
when they're very young so I try not to
knock on the English especially if I'm
suspicious of whether or not that person
is a foreigner so that that aspect aside
the issue that this person seems to be
bringing up is that because the IHS is
not soldered to the dye my tests are
inconsistent and to that I have two
points the first is that if you're only
standard is that the CPU die be soldered
to the IHS then that's not a very good
standard to uphold because if you look
at the 9900 K for example that solder
drop I would regard as pretty crappy and
it does not mean under every
circumstance that you're going to have
lower
temps overall my second point is that
who cares about lower temps even if that
was your goal the idea here is
consistency and if we're talking about a
thermal interface material that's
similar to thermal compound that we use
on top of an IHS right between that
metal heat spreader and a CPU cooler
it's still going to give you consistent
results in long run unless it is just
like you know I can't even really think
of a scenario where that would be an
issue unless the the Tim was not
completely covering the die or somehow
not making contact with the IHS but you
would be you would be made aware of that
fairly quick because CPU temperatures
would skyrocket and you'd probably
thermal throttle all most immediately so
unless that's happening it's probably an
okay solder or Tim spreading drop
whatever you want to call it but he went
on he went on to continue pushing this
notion and that's that I think that's
the most dangerous part about it is
people who are so blindly convinced
about things that have no factual basis
or ground are super devout and super
just you know you can't convince them
otherwise
that's dangerous ignorance is bliss and
to this person I'm sure I don't know the
Earth revolves around the moon so he
continues by saying just retest it
properly please no matter if it will be
FX risin or any other CPU just make it
real you even used carbon pads but
forget the basics you need soldered CPU
to properly test CPUs again okay if this
was true then I would say at least fifty
percent of all CPU and cooler reviews
out there by all the other tech tubers
on YouTube and ello websites whatever
they're all wrong they're all inaccurate
because most Intel CPUs at least up to
this point have not had soldered IHS is
so that's one point worth mentioning
also the he touches on the use of carbon
pads he's talking about the carbon ion
thermal grizzly pads that I've used in
cooler reviews since we reviewed the
thermal pads in this video and there's I
try to stress this in every video as
well the reason why I use those carbon
op pads is because they're extremely
consistent you can reuse them over and
over and not notice any performance
degradation I mean it's literally carbon
carbon is not going to disappear right
and I know this of course assumes that
there's
going to be some variance with thermal
paste application and a few channels
already concluded that unless you do
something super weird with how you apply
thermal paste your temperatures should
not vary from from run to run but I used
thermal pads just to be safe just to add
that extra layer of consistency for you
guys because it's important that you see
tests on a fair basis you know obviously
if I use like half a thermal pad for one
test and then a full thermal pad for
another that wouldn't be a fair
comparison and it would give you results
that are not true or not accurate at
least in the real world I got more than
a few of you asking why I only tested
with one fan and I have a very simple
explanation for why I did that it's
because only one fan was included in the
Box if cooler master or be quite had
included two 120mm fans or 140mm fans
whatever were to fit with the cooler in
question then I would have tested in
both the one fan and two fan config I
did that in this video where we tested
the knock schewe oh gosh I don't even
remember the name the u12 a new 12 s
something like that it's in that video
anyway that cooler came with two 120mm
fans and I tested in a single fan config
and then a two fan config to see how the
temperature varied and to determine
whether or not that second fan even
mattered because in at least in my
testing that second fan didn't change
much so if other people come out and get
different results I'd like to know the
the scenario is what was a testing
environment like you know why did you
get the results you did and why did they
differ from mine because I don't think
mine are the gold standard I expect
people to get different results maybe
not huge hugely different results but
you know some variants here and there is
I think a good thing and it helps us
explain why we see what we see in nature
one critique I took the heart a few days
ago is someone complained that I wasn't
using a case for my cooler reviews an
open-air test bench is not indicative of
the real world because most people use
in closed cases and my argument at the
time was well the Delta shouldn't really
change if the coolers within 1 degree
Celsius of each other in the atmosphere
they should theoretically be the same if
they're both enclosed in the same space
but nonetheless I use the case for the
last cooler review because I want this
to be more indicative of the real world
and even if the results are the same
it just helps people sleep better at
night knowing that I am testing in a
similar environment to the one that they
use on a daily basis that makes sense
and that's good feedback that said a few
others in the last video were asking why
I wasn't using to fans or why I wasn't
using standardized fan testing and this
goes back to what I said earlier
I test what is in the box so if
Coolermaster includes really good fan
I'm going to test with that fan I don't
expect people to have a really nice
knock to a fan just on standby that they
can use for their new cooler especially
if we're talking about a budget cooler
like the hyper 212 black edition or the
212 evo those $30 coolers are not gonna
come with the best fans I mean that's
part of the compromise it's why you get
them so cheap but I don't expect you to
spend $30 on a single fan to put on a
$30 cooler that to me makes no sense so
that's why I test with what is just in
the box there's also an incentive there
it encourages companies to include
better components for the price so that
when I test what is in the box they
perform better in the long run so those
are a few of the things that I wanted to
address in this video I wanted you guys
to know why I do what I do I wanted you
to hear an explanation in a video versus
you know individual comments because I
don't feel like I do those justice I
just try to type them quickly and move
on to the next one we there's a lot of
comments to address
so hopefully this clears some things up
if you guys still have more questions or
concerns you can leave those in the
comments below we're gonna be taking our
cooler test very seriously going forward
not that we haven't already but you guys
seem to really like those so I'm gonna
try to keep those very standardized in
the future along with our case reviews
we're talking about air flow and things
of that sort I also want to get a proper
sound measuring device so I'm not sure
what exactly I want to go with if you
guys have suggestions for that link me
something in the comment section and
I'll be sure to check those out you guys
have been awesome thumbs up if you liked
the video click there and subscribe if
you haven't already and stay tuned for
