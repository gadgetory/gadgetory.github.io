the more I reflect on the events of this
year in the last the more of this entire
escapade seems hypocritical but on whose
behalf ours and theirs and here's why I
feel this way it's easy to look past
certain things but an activate Windows
watermark yeah not one of those things
snag a verified Oh a.m. Windows 10 key
from s CD key for a little over 10 bucks
and enjoy a fully activated OS without
the annoying compromises use offer code
as studio for an 18 percent discount on
your order so I'm just gonna start this
one out by reading a few top comments
and their YouTube videos related to hua
ways of national security threat these
are actually pulled from I believe a
CNBC YouTube video I would rather the
Chinese spy on me than the US government
probably because Huawei doesn't leave
backdoors to the US CIA for spying USA
if you all use Huawei how can I continue
spying the world so do you see trend
there it seems like as of late more
people are aware of various degrees of
spying that take place on a day to day
basis within governments and if anything
are more content about it now because we
continue to use those products knowing
this is happening on the DL it's
something the u.s. is notorious for
especially after leaks from people like
Edward Snowden who became a well famous
or infamous depending how you look at
him whistleblower over US government
surveillance programs I should meet my
phone that he thought were vastly
overreaching and intrusive without a
doubt our own government spies they just
have to be a little more forthcoming
about it now or at least that's what
we're supposed to believe the truth is
spying has always existed because
information that can be obtained it's
that much more valuable when the
opposing party has no idea you've
obtained it consider the show bait car
this was a series on the u.s. involving
random cars that were left either
running open or unlocked and it's very
sketchy parts of whatever town they
happened to be in police would watch
them far as potential suspects snooped
around and debated grand theft
eventually someone would hop in the car
attempt to drive away and be stopped by
a flood of hidden officers who
conveniently had a kill switch built
into the car in question the show itself
was controversial for a number of
reasons which is probably
I'm saying was not is but I use this
analogy to shed light on the importance
of spying verse generic surveillance in
the case of the latter the subject knows
more than likely that he or she is being
watched or at least it's implied spying
however involves total secrecy you
aren't supposed to know what's happening
and when a spy is caught well yeah bad
news for the spy the u.s. claims a
Huawei is a puppet for the Chinese
government so they're technically
accusing China of spiney necessarily
Huawei is an important distinction to
make think of the company more like a
tool it's convenient for China because
they have a front they're undercover and
I have no doubt that this is actually
happening I mean sure you'll find
several articles out there stating that
no official proof has been outlined by
the House Intelligence Committee or any
other branch of government especially
when they've been asked for information
the stuff they've actually revealed is
not really that forthcoming if the u.s.
revealed the proof that they had on
Hawaa way spying then they'd be
compromising their own means of spying
so I can kind of understand why we
haven't gotten an explicit answer yet so
you can think of it like two thieves
breaking into a bank and then one of
those thieves calling the cops on the
other right both are going to jail so
yes folks China and the u.s. both spy
right this shouldn't be news to any of
you other country to do it as well we're
just focused on these two because Huawei
seems to be taking massive heat as of
late so where is the hypocrisy then I
bet my bank account China has many
companies working on the deal for its
Ministry of Public Security some are
even probably publicized as being arms
of the Chinese government
they've already admitted to a lot of it
Chinese citizens are being watched 24/7
and you know what that's their reality
here in the States we have a different
expectation of privacy though it should
be noted however that there is no
specific right to privacy referenced
except what is referenced in the Fourth
Amendment the Constitution Katz V u.s.
clearly defines limits of search and
seizure particularly when a government
agency is involved this includes phone
surveillance which is defined as an
unwarranted search but that doesn't stop
the u.s. from doing it on a daily basis
and this ties back into Snowden's
revelation of classified material
proving that the US was still actively
involved in surveying phones emails and
cameras of millions of guests their own
citizens so do you see the hypocrisy
now speaking of media and government
what I honestly believe to be an equal
or even more hypocritical aspect of the
Chinese system is its governing
dominance over media outlets love homer
Hayden Fox CNN MSNBC and others while
they do have their inherent biases and
most of them are pretty obvious they are
not by definition state-run the US
government doesn't force writers and
anchors to say certain things he
obviously can't misquote with the
attention of deceit and all that stuff's
all covered in the First Amendment that
would conflict with yeah the First
Amendment but the right to the freedom
of the press and expression of opinion
is also covered under the First
Amendment and that's why it's such an
important Amendment that's why it's the
first one in China's case however
state-run media filters undesired
opinions and even facts what their
government wants to be heard will be
heard so when you see surveys and
announcements by state-run Chinese media
that you know their citizens are content
with the security laws in place you got
to take that with a huge chunk of salt
because are they really pulling Chinese
citizens in mass and then just you know
straight-up
importing those raw results into a
script that an anchor will read in China
honestly try to picture that but here's
where it really gets me
when mangwon xu the CFO of Huawei was
detained in Canada over suspicions that
US sanctions against Iran had been
violated the Chinese government argued
that the US was quote violating the
rights and interest of Chinese citizens
this is extremely hypocritical as John
Stonestreet Roberto Rivera point out
they say that men's rights should be
respected obviously but that her
government's appeal to those rights
should not be trying to frequently
incarcerates large populations of people
because of the religions that they
practice free speech as we know it
does not exist their search and seizure
due process none of that and I say all
of that to say this
no country's hands are clean we've
fought massive wars over intelligence
over oil over pieces of paper we've and
I'm talking about all people here on
planet Earth
we've spied on millions upon millions of
people for the sake of intelligence for
the sake of the upper-hand the sake of
power does any of this really need to be
said I mean honestly I feel like I'm
kind of preaching to the choir here but
this is something that I think is just
it's easy to point the finger at the
other country but you could imagine how
a lot of them are probably seeing this
the same way the u.s. is notorious for
this kind of stuff and look if you're
this worried about Huawei you should
probably stay off the Internet as some
have said Facebook and Google are
probably spying as well and they're
probably better at it thanks to the
information you've so graciously thrown
their way I happen to agree if they're
not spying they're at least
collecting data in large sums and we're
volunteering it right the stark
difference between the US and China when
it comes to privacy in this case is that
in in the u.s. citizens freely and
willingly surrender their information
maybe not to the government directly but
they could certainly gain access to it
when needed by either a subpoena or
surveillance China forces its citizens
into giving it up so you get what I'm
saying right millions of cameras all
over that country were put in place to
spy on US citizens sure the u.s.
probably has a similar infrastructure
but a lot of it's a decentralize and
local a gas station might have a
security camera over its cash register
but it's not state-run and the NSA
probably isn't watching 24/7
maybe it is I have no idea the Internet
has opened so many doors for so many
surveillance programs and I imagine it
will only get worse with time so this is
probably both the US and China's fault
when I see articles pertaining to Huawei
and things like Google dropping partial
support and the government discouraging
sales and blacklisting them I just kind
of chuckle I mean it is hypocritical
sure you could argue that Chinese you
know companies and the Chinese
government handle things far worse but
blood is on our hands as well
figuratively and literally ignorance is
bliss what it ultimately comes down to
is who you are more comfortable with
spying on you because it's happening all
the time it's you know something a
tinfoil hat is not going to fix that
here are only so thick you guys have
been awesome I appreciate the the
patient's watching this one and if you
have a comment or suggestion for future
video leave that in the comments section
below that's what it's there for if you
also have a very strong opinion about
this particular topic leave that in
comment section I'm sure - I'm sure I'll
see many of those I'll just leave it at
that thumbs up thumbs down you know to
do click that red subscribe button
become a member feeling especially fancy
now catch on the next one this is
science studio thanks for watching and
thanks for
