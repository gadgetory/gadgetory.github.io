regards to Amy's next-generation CPU and
GPU architectures how powerful will they
be how efficient how affordable we're
going to answer all those questions in
this video so stay tuned recall AMD's
previous GPU naming scheme the southern
islands which was based on the raid on
HD 7000 series included graphics cards
such as the seventy eight seventy
seventy nine fifty and seventy nine
ninety you may recall the codename
Tahiti used to describe in particular
the seventy nine fifty and seventy nine
seventy these were later rebranded as
the r9 280 and 280x respectively the
Hawaii GPU famous for its extraordinary
thermal output and inclusion into the
292 90 X and 390 series cards was a part
of AMD's volcanic islands family now in
this case AMD has decided to change
things up a bit
originally dubbed the Arctic Islands
ambe's next generation graphics cards
will include GPUs named after stars and
constellations
hence the familiar name Polaris the
Polaris family will include the next
phase of our the RX 402 here graphics
cards similar to r7 470 + r9 490 later
this year each card will include hdmi
2.0 a support which on top of supporting
4k up to 60fps will also include HDR
support and higher contrast values and
games and movies the cards will also
feature h.265 support which will allow
4k content encoding it up to 60fps as
well h.265 will aid in the cards ability
to interpret 4k footage in particular by
eliminating color washing and increasing
complexity area control basically just
makes your image look a little better
DisplayPort 1.3 will also be a standard
on these cards Polaris is also an
extremely efficient 14 nanometer design
a recent AMD event showcased a prototype
graphics card equipped with a Polaris
GPU running star wars battlefront and
1080p with medium settings at 60fps it
only drew 286 watts of power compared to
the 140 watts required by Nvidia's GTX
950 for the same experience that's a 61%
increase in efficiency between the two
cards
impressive AMD hopes to bring virtual
reality to the forefront in gaming and
if noted that their minimum VR Spectre
graphics cards will likely be under the
350 US dollar range
currently the GTX 970 and r9 390
graphics cards are the bare minimum for
VR gaming so expect Polaris to replace
and improve upon the 390 at around the
same price point the performance figures
for even the most powerful cards in the
Polaris lineup are unfortunately still
entirely unknown though the r9 nano and
fury X will likely be superseded in
terms of performance and performance per
watt now what do we know about Zen if
you aren't familiar then is the code
name given to the next-generation
microarchitecture for AMD CPU lineup it
will replace the excavator architecture
which was the last revision of the
bulldozer family made famous most
notably by the FX 6300 all Zen CPUs will
utilize the am for socket and be built
on a 40 nanometer process a significant
step forward from the 32 and 28
nanometer processes of the FX CPUs and a
series ap use only ddr4 will be
supported by Zen although the next
generation ap use which will also use
the unified am for socket will support
both ddr3 and ddr4 in terms of
performance the IPC or instructions for
clock which is a measure of CPU
performance of a single Zen core has
improved by 40 percent over that of an
excavator core according to AMD for
comparison Intel's newest CPU
architecture skylake received only a 6
percent IPC increase from Haswell the
4000 series and a 3 percent increase
from Broadwell the 5000 series an IPC is
typically expressed as a ratio that is a
percent increase or decrease from a
baseline value while not always accurate
an IPC can be used to directly estimate
scores and CPU intensive tasks such as
Cinebench r15 for example given only a 6
percent IPC increase from Haswell to
skylake in a single core Cinebench r15
score of 120 for the Haswell processor
one should expect the skylake CPU single
core score to end up around 127 all
other things equal these estimates
however it can be inaccurate if
different generations of RAM are used
between the platforms in question or if
core count or core clock speeds are
different so how will then perform
head-to-head against Haswell or skylake
CPUs well if we take AMD's claim at face
value that Xen will perform about 40
percent better than excavator this means
that it will perform about 65 percent
better than bulldozer and CPU intensive
tasks however Intel's Ivy Bridge IPC was
already 55 percent higher than
bulldozers when both architectures were
released in 2012 from Ivy Bridge to
Haswell IPC increased by 11 percent
this means that haswell's IPC is roughly
66 percent higher than bulldozers and
according to this math literally on par
with Xen 66 percent over 65 percent I
should note that other sources list
smaller IPC gains between Ivy Bridge and
Haswell the estimates range anywhere
between 5% and 15% so this means the
Sens per core instruction speed could be
anywhere between 7% slower and 3% faster
than haswell's
in terms of skylake its IPC improvement
over Haswell was very small about 6
percent of you recall from a bit earlier
this means that in relation to skylake
Xen could have an IPC anywhere from 13
to 3 percent lower than sky lakes it's
actually not bad this in combination
with simultaneous multithreading similar
to hyper threading on Intel side up to
64 PCIe lanes and core counts up to even
16 as speculated by a few sites should
pose quite a threat to intel's current
lineup and it's about time this could
leave big impressions on the
microprocessor industry some serious
competition from AMD could once again
spark the consumer CPU races from the
early 2010 decade and prompt a various
price cuts all across the industry ddr4
prices could continue to fall and
slightly compatible motherboards will
likely dip further in price to better
compete with AMD's likely already
competitive price point both Polaris and
Xen look very promising from my personal
perspective here in the studio but I
want to hear from you be sure to let me
know in the comments below if you will
consider products from either of these
lineups additionally if you want to
start discussions ask questions or even
help out fellow youtubers with their
tech related problems be sure to do all
those things in the comment sections
below as well I greatly appreciate that

button why not what can go wrong right
this is science to do thanks for
learning with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
