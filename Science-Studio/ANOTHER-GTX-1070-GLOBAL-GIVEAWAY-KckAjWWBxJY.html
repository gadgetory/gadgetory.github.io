and just like the title says another GTX
1070 will be given away i'm not giving
away one of these two in particular
these are the ones that go in Heisenberg
I'm adding some benchmarks on the r9
fury right now but I will be giving away
a galax GTX 1070 EXO see they're the
same company that makes the Hall of Fame
edition graphics card except this is the
EOC EXO see model excuse me it's a black
graphics card it comes with a back plate
has RGB functionality just you know
typical run a mill GTX 1070 the Center
for review I'll be doing my review on
that within the coming days and then I'm
just going to package your back up and
have it ready to send to one of you now
who can enter anyone all you need to do
is follow me on one of three sites
Twitter Instagram or Facebook Salazar
studio YT you guys know the hashtag you
know the app whatever my username it's
the same all across the board and it
doesn't matter where you live so the
global giveaway like it always is and
don't be discouraged if you live
somewhere other than the United States
which is where i live in fact all three
of the winners of the giveaways have
done in the past have not been in the
united states so you know your chances
are as good as anyone elses who happens
to live much closer than you may so
that's it all you need to do is follow
me on one of those three social media
outlets and you will be good as gold I
did choose the last winner from Twitter
so your best chances are Instagram and
Facebook that's not to say I won't
choose somebody from Twitter I just I'm
trying to be all encompassing here
because not everybody uses Twitter not
everybody uses Facebook etc so that's
all I'm asking I'm not doing any special
website I'm not you know forcing you to
follow me or verifying that you are I'm
not doing any of that all I have to do
is follow me that's it that's all I'm
telling you to do it helps me out it
helps my social outreach it's good for a
channel like this to have social media
presence so it does give me a kick back
and in turn I can I guess reward one of
you with a card and kind of get everyone
else excited for the future of this
channel and for future giveaways this
will not be the last giveaway by any
means if you were under the age of 18
all I ask that you do is have a parent
or guardian represent you I will be
entering his or her name on the shipping
label just for legal reasons that's the
only other thing I think I need to
mention in this video global giveaway
anyone can enter just follow me on one
of the three social media outlets
using this user name right here cell is
our studio YT can I think I guess I can
fit it right there yeah it's gonna be
right there and you'll be good to go so
facebook.com for / sounds our studio YT
and then at Salazar studio YT on both
Instagram and Twitter you're good to go
have fun best of luck I'll have the
winner chosen on December 14 hopefully
and get your card by Christmas time and
if you don't celebrate Christmas
whatever still a gift from the channel a
big thanks for following me and putting
up with me on social media this is
Salazar's to do best of luck I'll catch
you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
