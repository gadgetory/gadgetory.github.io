comprised of six elements five of which
occur naturally or an oxide States
that's carbon silicon germanium tin lead
and floor opium that last one it's
artificial extremely radioactive and
potentially gaseous at room temperature
despite exhibiting characteristics of a
metal starting with the family's lowest
atomic number we have carbon it is a
common element of life as we know it
thanks to its abundance and tendency to
covalently bond in fact nearly ten
million compounds involving carbon are
known to exist in electronics
applications carbon is benefited by its
four valence electrons as well as its
high heat tolerance carbon fibers in
particular are extremely resistant to
chemicals and exhibit high tensile
strengths despite their relatively low
weights and recent advancements with
respect to carbon nanotubes are opening
massive doors in the pharmaceutical
sector certain carbon nylon combinations
can act as catheters C and T's may be
used to fight certain cancers by
blocking unique receptors single walled
CMT's can even kill certain bacteria
like e-coli by puncturing and breaking
down their cell membranes I could go on
for hours but we've got other elements
to consider in this family up next is
silicon a bluish silver metalloid that
also acts like a semi conductor meaning
it has properties of both an electrical
conductor and an insulator early
chemists believe silicon occurred in
nature as a metal oxide hence the
proposed name Silesia which although it
sounds really cool is factually
incorrect the ion part meant that it was
a metal but by the 1800s we confirmed
that it was a nonmetal similar in
structure to carbon a way we can confirm
this is in the lab silicones electrical
resistance decreases as its temperature
rises which is the opposite of how
metals behave this is due to silicones
energy gap so to compensate scientists
doped silicon with other elements to
control conductivity and the flow of
energy which is why silicon is used in
nearly all modern microprocessors to
date and while silicon is a standalone
element doesn't exist on earth and many
silicates or silicon oxides account for
up to a quarter of the planet by weight
it is therefore easy to isolate and
utilize electronics glasswork and
biology the next element to consider is
germanium it's a shiny metal Lloyd and
also a semiconductor or
point-contact amplifying transistors
actually utilize germanium before they
ever use silicon oddly enough the
element in its Germania form that's a
germanium dioxide is actually super
useful in the world of optics it boasts
a high refraction index meaning it slows
light down significantly and at a sharp
angle perfect for wide-angle lenses and
fiber optics germanium is used in solar
panels LEDs fluorescent lamps and even
effects pedals for guitars
it gives that fuzzy distortion sound
from 50s rock and roll so why is silicon
used in place of germanium then for one
its abundance germanium is rare silicon
is not electron bonds and silicon are
stronger as well and germanium also
breaks down at higher temperatures where
silicon remains unfazed tin is the next
element in the Carbon group it's magic
atomic number of 50 means it's extremely
stable with many isotopes it doesn't
readily oxidized an air making it a
great anti-corrosion applicant for iron
carbon alloy like steel a historical
avocation was in the production of
bronze which is one ace 10 and 7/8
copper in case you were wondering at
temperatures approaching absolute zero
tin becomes a type 1 superconductor
meaning it exhibits literally no
electrical resistance with respect to
electronics it's widely used in Sauter's
thanks to its low melting point of
roughly 230 degrees Celsius in fact
certain isotopes have even lower melting
points than this
however its ability to whisker as well
as it's relatively low conductivity
renders it obsolete for wires and traces
when seen in the context of copper gold
and silver lastly we have lead it's
dense soft and readily oxidizes it also
has the highest stable atomic number on
the periodic table of elements it's used
in batteries paints altars and various
alloys it's often found in sulfur
compounds the most common of which is
Galena or lead sulfide I probably
mispronounced that funny enough the
Romans who use a lead for many things
never distinguished lead from tin
instead referring to both as black and
light lead respectively the element is
easy to extract hence its widespread
historical use for things like plumbing
cookware and construction think of how
we use steel today the only difference
is that steel isn't generally toxic lead
tends to disrupt enzyme function by
mimicking the properties of other
essential metals in the blood like iron
and calcium it can degrade myelin
sheaths blocked blood flow to the brain
stunt growth destroy the kidneys it's
dangerous to say the least and up until
only recently modern infrastructure
included lead plumbing LED pain sled
gasoline imagine what we're exposing
ourselves to now without fully
understanding side effects as such
let's applications and electronics
specifically involve isolated consumer
tools like lead acid batteries it's even
used in super capacitors but it's
gradually being phased out of solder for
obvious reasons thanks for watching this
