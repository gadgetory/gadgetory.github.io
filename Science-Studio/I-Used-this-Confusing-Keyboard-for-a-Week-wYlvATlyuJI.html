low-profile cherry-red keyboards from
Coolermaster with a confusing target
audience I can say that confidently but
I absolutely love mine and yeah not for
the reasons you probably think
so this will be a short review
relatively speaking of a keyboard that
I've spent about a week with you can
grab either of these models by the way
that's 6:30 or 2 650 on sites like
Amazon or Ebay we've affiliate link them
down below the only difference between
them is the 10 key inclusion on the 650
model which is the one that I've been
using personally the one that I have
here in front of me the 630 so you'll
see more of this one because it's easier
to film it's not as wide anyway
they definitely take a bit of getting
used to just put it lightly perhaps
that's an understatement and I'm still
not fully adjusted to the low profile
key caps nor for that matter the red
switches I'd much prefer Browns or the
more tactile Blues when replying to
emails or writing scripts but when
gaming I think reds or reds are okay and
look that's an unfortunate side effect
of this model you'll be stuck with
cherry low-profile red switches no
matter what so if you plan to use this
for productivity alone yeah you should
probably look elsewhere but let's start
with physical attributes before
addressing organ onyx the aluminum deck
I'm going to call it the deck I'm not
sure what the actual term is for this
underneath the keys it's actually a nice
touch
it's got chamfered edges provides added
flare the board connects to your PC via
USB C and a long braided cable is
included and then there's husb a on the
other side but USB C to connect the
cable to the keyboard itself the RGB
integration is beautiful cooler masters
led functions are embedded as usual and
limiting the need for dedicated software
the effects are varied and wide-ranging
so I'm sure you'll find something
tasteful these are just a few here now
on to the field this is where on to
spend the bulk of the review typing is
difficult at best the key caps are large
and slightly concave but nowhere near as
concave it's a traditional mechanical
keyboard they are raised quite a bit
above the aluminum deck and I think
that's where the issues begin to pile on
so my words per minute for example
dropped by about 20 to 25 percent with
this keyboard compared to a cherry red
MK 750 or just another mechanical cherry
red keyboard a traditional mechanical
one or what you would call a gaming
keyboard and yeah that's after a week of
trying to get used to this so I'd say
that's probably a problem now the
optimal keyboard in my sense for my
everyday use which includes scripting
gaming just content creating all that
stuff is a brown switch keyboard
mechanical preferably traditional deck I
really like the feel of those keyboards
it took a bit of getting used to I was
used to just the membrane the chief
keyboards for the longest time just
because that's all I had available to me
in school but this is like radically
different from anything I've ever used
before and I think that's why I'm still
struggling to get my words per minute up
so if you're if you plan on typing a lot
of stuff on your computer and you want
to use keyboard like this it will have a
severe learning curve you can't just
pick this thing up and just start typing
right away it looks more like a laptop
keyboard but it's not even close to that
I actually have a higher wpm with my
laptop my qua way mate book X Pro which
has just you know I'll kind of it's not
a great keyboard but yeah you can say
this like no key travel is really not
much feedback the keys are spaced about
as far apart as they are on the sk6 30
and 50 which is kind of funny but other
than that the similarity stop and if I
had to pick between my laptop keyboard
and this keyboard for productivity
despite the fact that I've used a laptop
a lot longer I would say that I'm
actually more keen to typing better on
the laptop and then the wpm obviously
shows that so whatever you think about
that aside it's definitely a beautiful
board but it does come with that huge
compromise one of the reasons why I
think that's the case is because the
keys themselves are very close together
they are not very concave meaning that
it doesn't really wrap around your
finger each key I'm talking about here
and that could be an issue like if
you're trying to find the bridge between
two keys a space is so small sometimes
you accidentally hit a key next to the
one you're trying to hit and that could
cause an issue when typing you can see
how many errors I had in this test here
versus a traditional red switch
mechanical keyboard that's an issue now
the second issue is key height and this
comes down really to the switch
mechanism use I think low profile cherry
Reds are great in other cases but in my
opinion they should have been avoided
here there are plenty of low profile
keyboards on the market and that managed
with much more compact switches and many
of which will include a small deal of
actual actuation right that feedback
that you want from something like
blues or Browns even you don't get any
of that with Reds that's why Reds aren't
preferable for typist or anything of the
sort
so if you're going for that if you still
want low profile and you want better
type ability if you will then don't go
for this go for something else I'll link
something down below now up to this
point all of my feedback has been from
the fingers of a mixed user someone who
edits videos types the occasional script
replies the email surfs the web in place
the occasional video game on PC but what
if we're talking about just video games
what a keyboard like this serve any
purpose oh yeah this one's a bit harder
to test I don't have a wpm calculator
that works for a game like fortnight per
se but what I can say is that gaming is
actually doable arguably equitable with
this keyboard as it is to a beefier MX
red counterpart I know that sounds super
silly and like I'd never expect eSports
gamers to suddenly buy these up in bulk
to replace their a long time go-to
peripherals I know Lisa's not the
biggest fan of this style keyboard I
think this is more of an aesthetic play
than anything else that said I don't
think the average gamer wouldn't mind
the change of pace I mean if you just
want to try something new this
definitely feels new and the red key
inclusion certainly helps in various
titles the actuation is steady and
predictable a drawback however is the
angle of the board this could make
things uncomfortable a time you can't
really incline it and you don't really
have like a wrist support of any kind
included so yeah this will depend on the
user it's just something you need to
keep in mind if you decide to buy this
now look I want to love these keyboards
I really do and to an extent I actually
do love them they're definitely
different
I like the cooler masters kind of I
don't know treading new waters here so
if you're looking for a change in favor
aesthetics over sheer functionality and
this could be something you could get
used to but it won't be an easy process
I mean even if you're coming from a
genuine low profile keyboard or laptop
even the SK 6 30 and 50 are beast of
their own take my word for it if you can
find one on display somewhere like Best
Buy or Micro Center again I strongly
encourage you to play around with it a
bit just before you pull the trigger so
that said I can't openly recommend these
boards for that reason alone they're
just they're too different and I think
that most people are going to be a
little too impatient to
the pickup on the learning curve my
typing speed and accuracy alone are a
testament to that I have however linked
the boards again down below for those
who are confident in their purchase
decisions or for those who may have
already had hands-on experience just one
a second second opinion maybe you're
just watching this because you want to
see if you know I'm experiencing the
same things you experienced when you
tried this thing out in a store or
something one more thing before I go
these aren't cheap I had no idea going
into this that they'd be well over $100
a piece yeah I was frankly stunned by
that and strongly urged Coolermaster to
reconsider their target audiences with
these I understand that new ventures can
be costly but you risk ruling out
entirely new entrants on the consumer
side by charging nearly $200 for a
keyboard that arguably does its job
worse than leading keyboards in the $100
price range and now looking super sexy
isn't a good enough excuse all of these
do look pretty darn sexy but that's all
for me and this one like subscribe and
