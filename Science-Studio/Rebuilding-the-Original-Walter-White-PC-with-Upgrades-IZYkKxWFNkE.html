building inside the NZXT H 700 I I just
reviewed it you can check out that
review video right here but you guys
wanted to see what a build looks like
inside of this not just a review of the
case features and that's what we're
gonna do in this video so I've got the
fractal design mesh if I see sitting in
front of the H 300 I because we'll be
taking most of the components in this
build and throwing them into here
primary reason why we're doing that's
because the motherboard in here it's the
msi tomahawk x2 99 arctic addition
motherboard is is a white PCB board so
that will look really good in the white
H 700 I excuse me there's too many names
to worry about here and then we'll be
throwing in also a 360 ex-captain
RGB AIO cooler not because it's the best
AIO out there cuz it's not but because i
think it looks the best and this will
fit with the white color scheme also
we're going to be pairing a Kraken g12
which is a basically it's a graphics
card mount for a typical Kraken AIO
we'll be using the Kraken X 42 to cool
our 1080 TI in here so we stripping off
the reference what's not a reference
cooler but it's just a blower style
cooler from P&amp;amp;Y
and putting on the G 12 bracket with the
X 42 and we should have a pretty sweet
looking white theme build we're
basically gonna call this the new Walter
White PC I'm not sure how many of you
watching this video were around when I
uploaded the original walter white pc
build log that was a super-fun built and
a lot of you fell in love with the white
color scheme there weren't too many
white builds on youtube at the time
especially you know that weren't custom
cool it was a relatively cheap build by
comparison it had a 10-7 unit I think
it's 6700 K so we're going to up the
ante a bit by throwing in 270 100x this
time around and a GTX 1080 TI but we
sticking with the same white color
scheme which is nice and though also
will be using primarily NZXT components
with the deep cool cap and 240 X being
upgraded this time to the 360 RGB X but
we know
sticking with similar components in that
sense the similar coolers and similar
cases also similar white motherboards so
without further ado let's start
dissecting this build and throwing the
components into the 8700 I
all right so this is where we are with
the motherboard installed in the H 700 I
looks very good I like how the white
accents on the board match the white
cable shroud which I have in different
opinions on at this point I still think
it's been get in the way of our radiator
AIO we're going to put up top and that's
going to be the deep pool captain 360 X
RGB cooler so stay tuned for that
installation this video and then we'll
also probably take these two SSD trays
out we're not going to put three SSDs up
here I think we're gonna have one in the
front so very simple here the modularity
of this case you just pull these two off
and it actually doesn't look like SSD
trays even belong up here anymore which
is cool so if you're if you're not keen
on putting two or three SSDs up front
you can just remove the trays and it's
not going to look like you're you know
missing any important drive
now right off the bat here you can
already see how this cable shroud is
gonna be a pain to work around I was
thinking about running the tubing this
way so having the IO tubing starting on
the right side of the case and kind of
looping around back to the CPU block
versus doing it the other way cuz this
is pretty long tubing here but the
problem is if I want to drop this down
from you know it's the top I can get it
through the first slot but then trying
to wedge it you know between the cable
shroud and these pre-installed fans is
not gonna happen actually think I'm
gonna have to remove the fans to get
this block through the gap between the
cable shroud on the front of the chassis
to connect it to the motherboard so just
just a big pain here also for those who
were wondering actually I want to see
right now if we can remove the cable
shroud I am not sure if that is possible
let's see here okay so we got one screw
in the front so that's good news it's
kind of funny it's good news that we can
remove something there's another screw
so usually there's one up here something
yeah that's what screw up there no it's
hard to see but there is a screw there
and then I think there's one more at the
back of the case and if there is again
you can't see that but there's one back
there so there's three screws holding
the shroud in place so I think what
we're gonna do is go ahead and remove
the cable shroud and then we'll
reinstall it after everything is kind of
thrown into the case already
okay so I decided to mount the EIO to
the front of the case after mounting it
up top which was actually really easy
because of that removable bracket at the
top of the case I decided that the
cables looked and they're not the cables
but the tubes look just a little too
weird
because they're so long because the
radiator so long the extra tubing was
just kind of like doing a weird spiral
effect and I didn't really think that
was cool because it was trying to pop
out toward the the tempered-glass on the
left side so with this config here you
can see all we have to do is just kind
of wrap it up like that and it's a very
clean run this tubes look a lot better
in this orientation so that's what we're
gonna do and then keep in mind we're
also gonna have another set of tubes
running from the radiator mounted to the
back of the case to the g12 bracket on
our ten atti
and here you have it this is the new
original Walter White I know it's kind
of a play on words there's because I've
done like three renditions of Walter
White in the past but the original
Walter White had no water-cooling year
whatsoever in it just a white
motherboard a white AI oh and a white
case along with a white graphics card
that when I originally just painted this
one I'm using the G 12 bracket from NZXT
and I couldn't be happier with the
installation process here this is
actually a super cool custom
water-cooling graphics card bracket
which you can combine with any Kraken
AIO I was really happy again with the
installation process here and it makes
your graphics card super quiet super
cool without all the custom water
cooling hassle involved I'd also like to
give all of you a call to action if
you've built a PC in the past and looked
at anything like Walter White maybe had
a white theme going on that you were
working on before you saw the original
Walter White build or maybe you built
your PC in honor of Walter White which I
would say thank you very much for it's
an awesome tribute then follow me on
Twitter science studio whitey and send
your pictures to me just tag me in your
picture upload and I'll do my best to
retweet as many as I can I think it's
really cool to see all of your takes on
white PC built I like white because the
color of the PC or the theme kinda is
controlled by the RGB strip that you
have in there so white reflects any
color very well so if you want a red
bill just change the LED strips and
everything else in there to red and
there you go red bill so what I'm gonna
do for those who are interested in
building their very own Walter White
with a budget you know not something
that's overkill like this and I'm gonna
be frank with you most of the stuff I
get for free anyway so I really can't
even call this my bill because I didn't
pay for any of it out of pocket so it
doesn't make any sense from a
specification standpoint for most
workloads including gaming and I would
argue editing as well a thousand dollar
CPU and you'll be just fine with an 8700
K or 1770 hundred ex from risin what I'm
gonna do is link a cheaper alternative
you can make a build
almost exactly like this with much
cheaper hardware all those parts are
linked in the video description tied to
my Amazon and Newegg Ofili accounts so
any purchase through those does help us
quite a bit a small kickback but it all
adds up you know let's just produce more
content like this so check out that
cheap Walter white version in the
description it'll look very similar to
this in fact most of it is still
consisting of similar if not the same
parts but check that out if you want to
build something similar if you liked
this video be sure to give this one a
thumbs up I appreciate that give it a
thumbs down if you feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
life you get two choices there click the
subscribe button if you haven't already
it's a red button down below and that
little Bell notification icon for
notifications when I upload videos like
these this is science to do thanks for
building with us
