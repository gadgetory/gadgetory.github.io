just blew your eardrums out I do
apologize for that
we had to migrate I'm gonna check the
live feed here let's see I don't see I
don't see the chat
all right chats not working let's see
what we can do here I'm still learning
OBS or not OBS but Stream labs so yeah
sorry about the confusion hopping
between between chat rooms live
streaming room it's really confusing how
YouTube does it because you can set it
up as like an event right so you tell
YouTube when you want to go live which
is what we just did and it kind of
counts down to that but you have to use
a separate stream key or I can use my
dedicated livestream key for the channel
which basically goes live the moment I
click the live button in my streaming
service in this case Stream labs so I'm
not sure why you guys can't see the chat
is working no I know the chats working
but the chat is supposed to show up in
this this box right here so this box
you're supposed to see your chat and
it's not working by the way if someone
subscribes or someone donates you should
see something pretty cool if if it
doesn't work I'm just gonna be a big
letdown but I okay I see that the view
counter is working on the top left so
that's pretty cool
yeah there's so many things in here that
I you know you think you got it set up
right and then and then it's not set up
right and then by the time you go live
it's too late to fix most of this stuff
so I'm more or less just kind of
learning as we go here and yeah this is
the clean cut Greg I got a I actually
cut my own hair off you guys know that
but I do cut my own hair that's just
something that yeah I see that that
right there is that cool or what I think
that's pretty sweet
anyway I'm watching two separate live
streams with myself one is extremely
delayed and the other one isn't I just
want to make sure that all that stuff is
working out I I think that's so cool I'm
sorry I think it's I think it's cool oh
there he goes the wait the super chat
that should work
I'm not saying the superchip oh there it
is oh yeah come on you guys
you know that's pretty sweet I just
think that is so cool
I mean that's one of the benefits of
going with streamlines is that you can
kind of like it's like it's like OBS and
then some and you know I've done a
pretty good job doing this so yeah what
I've done basically is thrown in a bunch
of crash bandicoot references because
it's basically my favorite game of all
time hey the subscriber thing's probably
gonna get old I might end up turning
that off I'm not sure how many
subscribers will get from a live stream
anyway so that might not be as ideal in
the long run I just wanted to see it
kind of in action so if you guys are
unsubscribing and then recibir really
gonna throw us off I don't have to
disable it so please don't do that this
is more or less it's just yeah this is
for people who who are new and I say
that I'm sure a few of you're gonna end
up doing that anyway but thanks for the
thank you for the donations my dudes I
am not sure why your notification came
in twice white monster is really weird
thank you troll Thank You white monster
for those two dollar donations I
appreciate that
can I get a shoutout back I know what
going on dude audio falling going up and
down is it just you it's probably not
just you but I'm talking pretty normal
in here I'm not sure what's going on
with that yeah I'm working on the chat
I'm trying to get the chat box to show
up it's showing oh I know what it is you
guys there we go I got you now oh but
it's disappearing so quick you guys you
guys can see it now right I had the the
actual background image on top of the
chat box which is pretty stupid so I'm
sorry about that but it is there now so
you should be able to see it that's
pretty cool and it looks like the
messages are loading correctly they're
disappearing pretty quick though
yeah I'm not sure why the audio is going
up and down like that that's really
weird let's see if I can fix it your boy
gonna fix this and it is coming from
this too maybe yeah I know I know people
I know that audio is going up and down I
don't know what's going on with that
though let's see if that does anything I
might just have to talk quieter you know
and just hope that it doesn't hit you
guys really hard I'm not sure why it's
doing that
so that's releasing that's really
concerning anyway that microphone he has
right here and I'm I'm just you know
Bobby it has nothing to do with my hand
around my mouth my dude does that make
you feel powerful you want to tell me
take my hand away from my mouth what if
I do this the whole chat oh yeah just
like this
I'm sure this really bothers you doesn't
it actually kind of unsanitary please
don't do that
I'm not sure if me move SCIC it louder
now I'm not sure if if if I move closer
to the microphone if that's gonna fix it
though let's see here I'm gonna swing
this around that's kind of awkward
because it's going above the monitor
yeah I mean it's it's really not gonna
get much closer than that to be honest
you guys but that's it's really all I
got I'll slide it right here now that
looks weird it looks really weird yeah
I'll try to hang out like this and then
I'll just swing this window over that
way I can look forward directly into the
camera I'm sorry about the might the the
ups and downs if you guys are hearing
audio
peaks and troughs that's yeah that's
just we're gonna have to deal with right
now let me see you guys are saying that
the video looks a little fuzzy see if I
can fix that nope that was bad there we
go
that's about as good as gonna get folks
like I'm just using a webcam here this
is nothing this is not meant to be
professional in any way this is just me
I don't even know I have these on by the
way if the you know the crash bandicoot
sounds get annoying let me know I can
turn those down or just disable them
completely but I did want to give you
guys you know a chance to be featured
somewhat on the live stream I feel bad
that I had a chat open to people where
they're waiting for an hour so and then
I had a migrate over to the general chat
but and at least this way you all can be
seen in the chat so I'll have a chance
to look at your look at your questions
if you have some I will be happy to
answer them this is a Q&amp;amp;A you can ask me
whatever you'd like I'm not gonna
guarantee that I can answer it I might
not be able to answer some questions for
either just you know personal reasons
maybe I don't want to reveal certain
things about myself just because I don't
think that some of that stuff belongs on
the channel to be frank but if you have
anything tech related you want to know
you know you can ask personal questions
but don't make them weird you guys like
don't make them weird he said then I
just have to keep saying no and then I
feel really bad we have about 140 people
watching right now I appreciate that the
audio is gonna duck Chris nothing I can
do about it I don't know what's going on
okay I see DC or marvel gamemaster
that's like that that's it's gotta be
marvel man cuz Ironman that's the only
reason why is because Ironman let's see
how where did you meet your girlfriend
she's actually my wife Deadpool she's
not my girlfriend anymore we got engaged
a while back and then we got hitched my
hitch but we got married and that's
basically the start of this process of
figuring out where we're gonna live it's
really difficult if I wanted to move to
Germany it would be just as difficult as
if she wanted to move here although you
might think it's harder to move here in
the States
it's just immigration in general is a
pain so that is something that we're
going to be working on at the time being
but she's right now back in Germany
because you know she's just on a regular
visa right now so a regular travel and
difficulties ahead but I am a lucky man
to call that woman my life
or my wife she is my life but she's
my wife and I'm very fortunate and she
makes me really happy we can't hear the
crash bandicoot sounds I don't know
what's going on with that that's weird
we see David wheel it we we I don't know
if I said that right just a quick
question I bought a prebuilt last year
it came with some good parts but I'm
wondering if it'd be worth replacing the
stock 32 gigs ddr4 memory with faster
RAM no not don't bother Rams too
expensive right now your perfectly fine
with what you got are you a dog or cat
person
all right Shannon this is a really
difficult question from because I have
both the dog or dogs and cat and I can I
can see both sides of the argument right
cats are super chill they just they have
a litter box and that's basically it
dogs require more upkeep but they're
also more personal animals so they show
you more love and affection in most
cases but I'm kind of lazy when it comes
to maintenance and generally I try to
keep things clean but I don't like
having to constantly clean up the same
thing over and over and for that reason
I think I would have to choose a cat
because while cleaning the litter box
sucks you like to do that once I don't
know how long have to do it like once
every day every other day but with a dog
I take the dog out every 3 or 4 hours
you know and that that to me is just a
little too much I could potty train a
dog I'm a pretty dope though I think
that would be that would be when uh when
I would probably offer a dog or a cat
that's weird addicted PC says the audio
level now after you took off the headset
that's super strange because the
headsets off like that mics disabled so
does really make sense but that's what
happened are we gonna get more car
reviews more than likely I'm currently
selling my s5 I have a couple buyers
that might come out this weekend to buy
it and then I'm actually I've been
looking for a couple weeks now for a new
ride I might I want to step up my game
big-time I want to go to either an m4 a
Q 60s red sport
maybe if I considered a sedan it would
be maybe an Audi s6 or an Audi s6 that
would be the only one oh I love this 4
liter twin turbo engines you can you can
do so much with them and
just a simple ECU flash it gets you a
hundred plus horsepower and torque on
both sides so it so those are really
nice cars all of those I really like the
m4 though many m4 is the best of
everything it's like a just a total step
up from the s5 in all respects and you
can easily shell out 500 horsepower and
five hundred six hundred foot-pounds of
torque from just an ECU flash it
basically remaps Oh to sensor how much
air gets pushed into the engine and that
it basically changes your air fuel
mixture ratios and will give you more
power if you have more air to burn
bigger explosion more power pushes on
pistons and there you go more torque
more horsepower and five would be nice
too bad the AMG version you mean AMG you
mean let's Mercedes my dude
maybe mean the AMG equivalent I'm not
sure I like Mercedes Mercedes are nice
too but I think that I think I would
rather go with Audi over Mercedes they
just they're more classy but they're not
a sporty unless you go into the s-class
and by that point you're spending fifty
thousand dollars so yeah let's see what
do we have here
it's obeah is better than hangouts live
yeah I mean you can do more with OBS I'm
using stream Labs OBS which is even
better than OBS in my opinion I don't
use OBS for anything other than
streaming some people record their
screens with OBS I just think that's a
little too much it too much overhead
right CP utilization I use shadowplay
for the most part of course when I
benchmark though I turn all that off so
when you guys see like clips of me
in-game right and I'm showing a
benchmark simultaneously that is not the
exact same thing as the benchmark
statistics that you're seeing in the
graphs or what have you I usually record
those after the fact so as to not you
know induce some sort of framerate dip
as a result of the screen being recorded
and I don't use a capture card because I
I don't I have a capture card and I
there's just I don't really see the
point in it unless you want to use like
a dedicated video source that's not a
webcam it doesn't plug directly in your
PC I have really no use for one opiates
or xsplit I've never used to xsplit so I
really can't comment on that I want to
change one thing about the chat box
I noticed that it's only like the the
messages are only really lasting like
what four or five seconds so high
messages after see always show messages
alright let's see if that works
there we go okay so the chat now yeah
that's nice so now you guys can see your
chats the whole time they won't just
disappear as a result of you know the
time expiring mark DOMA and gum Mark
Gonzales thank you for that five down a
donation or $4.99 donated donation
you're shorting me a penny I appreciate
that though I won't take that penny
shortage to heart will you be doing any
reviews on the new NZXT kraken
120-millimeter m22 in the future so they
have the m22 right and then they don't
they have that now that new 360 mil rad
the x 72 is that i think it's no 82 i
don't remember what it is there's a 360
MLE io
kraken and they also have the m22 and i
really want to check out both I have you
know I have right here the NZXT case
with the build inside and here I'll go
ahead and just swing it around - guys
can see it kind of but yeah it's not
gonna give me any more than that but
that's the case and I have a deep cool
captain 240 or
actually that's a 360 Mele I Oh in there
and I have not taken it out because I
think it looks really good the only
thing I would change is for is a Kraken
and the only reason why I would do that
is because it would keep in NZXT theme
and I think they have pretty cohesive
components it look really nice in there
can you give your personal opinion on
when the new cards will come out from
rusty not too sure I mean if we look at
Pat and if we look back in a couple
years what I'm pretty sure pass/fail
architecture was announced at let's see
I'm actually curious when that was I'm
pretty sure it was the middle of 2016
let's see
sorry if that keyboard is like totally
messing you guys up yeah so May 6 2016
is when they announced it and they were
released on May 27th so if we're looking
at that timeline we should expect these
to be announced at around copy text time
which is gonna be like late May early
June so that'll be pretty awesome look
forward to if we do hear from Nvidia
anytime soon and we expect that we will
I mean we're sitting on two-year old
architecture by this point doesn't seem
like it's been that long right the
channel only started just shortly before
Pascal architecture was announced but
that's really cool we have another
question day Kim asked how old I am I am
23 I will be 24 in October in your
opinion who is the best case
manufacturer it really depends I have a
video about my favorite case you want to
look at it from that perspective I think
fractal design has my favorite case in
terms of like overall case designs like
who does it best I really can't put my
seal of approval if you will on any of
them because I think that some
manufacturers have I don't think there's
any manufacturer that doesn't write in
every case right there's always
something to point out that that is
either negative or something I would
personally change and so for that reason
I can't really point out a specific
company and say hey you know this this
looks really good but this doesn't look
really good so I'm gonna say that you're
the best company anyway like I can't
really do that I don't think there's a
company out there that's not a company
out there that is without sin it's what
I should say I think all of them messed
up in some regard and that's just the
learning experience right that's why
reviewers like myself exist because we
we are in a sense trying to represent
our viewers trying to represent our own
views based on our experiences with
multiple cases and in the past so they
listen to us to an extent which is an
honor and at the same time like they
want to drive sales they want to make
sales so if they really care they're
gonna listen to their audience you know
I try my best to represent the audience
you guys point out something that I
didn't
in a case review I'll do my best to
bring it up in the next review because
it's such a big deal to a lot of you so
that's that's what I try to do let's see
here I got shoe oh yeah boom there we go
when did you first start working on PCs
I built pcs I build pcs I would tear
down old pcs my dad would bring him home
like my dad's an electrical engineer he
would bring them home and disassemble
them or not dissemble he would bring
them home and let me disassemble them so
I would tear them all apart you know
what I was really I was like six seven
years old I would not have put them back
together I would literally take
everything apart he would take the power
supply from you know he wouldn't let me
get inside that I can see why now but I
would tear it all down to scrap and then
just kind of call it quits I wouldn't
know how to put it back together that
took me a while and then after that I
never really saw the viability in a
desktop computer for myself until I got
into college and then that's when the
channel started blowing up and when
people saw that we were building pcs
that's a pretty hot topic so I stuck
with that and that's why we are where we
are today and why we're talking about
what we're talking about in these videos
let's see Diamond dog 74 ass I'd like to
build the silent computer like the one
you featured in January okay and we
talking about but in a case up so don't
screw up but in a case like the Manta
that you featured back in July with
those be with windows be quiet CPU
coolers fit in that case you'll have to
check the height there you have to just
do the math really quick compare the
dimensions the NZXT website will have a
CPU cooler clearance like spec sheet
section just make sure that the cooler
you use is not too big the top flow one
like I use though I'm pretty sure
that'll fit you just have to check Ram
clearance and other things because that
cooler is literally the size of an ITX
motherboard just to make sure that you
have clearance elsewhere on the board I
would be more more worried about that
then then the you know other stuff
alright I am scrolling through scrolling
hmm let's see what do we have
mr. Salazar why are you racist toward
air-cooling I use their coolers I use
them a lot I'm ice island old had an air
cooler in it like that's only for
trolling but I really appreciate air
coolers and their look there you know
peace of mind right the only thing I can
break on an air cooler is the fan for
the most part I see a question from
Minda I am a 14 year old kid and I have
to money and I have money to build a PC
my father says he will not let me build
a PC because he doesn't trust I'll do a
good job and tells me just to buy pre
build Oh sad face you know what you
should do I know you're 14 years old but
if it's your money that you've saved up
you should go out and buy the parts
anyway build it impress him and then
maybe he'll take back what he said I'm
not asking you to fight your parents but
if it's your money and you're allowed to
do what you want with it but that's
within your legal rights then then I
would just source the parts anyway and
do a little on yourself and say hey dad
look what I did
you might impress them you never know we
have a question from Joseph Mason I'm
swapping out my CPU and motherboard in
my PC for the first time I am going to
run into issues trying to boot windows
from the same hard drive I had it
installed on originally ok so it really
depends on the platform you're gonna
have a performance drop when you switch
platforms period but the degree to which
you experience those drops and frame
rates and just overall you know see if
utilization will depend on where you're
going and what you're coming from so if
you switch from like a and B FX 6300 to
Intel coffee League and you keep the
same drive from your FX PC and throw it
into your coffee like build and you kind
of let you know windows you know update
drivers and stuff before boots and the
OS for the first time you're still going
to have performance loss
noticeable performance loss so you might
be wondering why you're not getting the
frame rate you should expect why other
people are getting higher frame rates
than you are the reason why is because
you're probably the the reason why is
because there there are so many
basically there are a lot of things
embedded on that in that drive that are
gonna conflict with drivers that don't
override when those new and new drivers
install upon first booting your new
system a clean wipe of your of your
drive is gonna be the best bet
I would transfer sensitive info first
before you do that because it's really
difficult to it's really difficult to
migrate data without performance loss it
really is all right I am scrolling up
here don't worry guys I'm trying to
filter out the trolls I'm just outright
blocking them so they'll never come back
to the channel
here we go here we go McLovin the
panhandle do you guys see McLovin I see
him where is will I don't know where
will is actually I tried we talked about
we talked usually once a day or once
every other day but today I was pretty
busy I never I never sent him a message
or anything so I'm not sure what he's up
to right now
geez it's 6:30 2:00 a.m. here crystalize
says well look I'm really sorry but I
can't go alive at the most opportune
time for everybody because time zones
exist in the earth as a sphere it's not
flat I hate to break it to you so I
can't please everybody
Jakob says awesome you guys see McLovin
there and go give his channel a
shout-out or no I'm giving your channel
shoutout but go give his channel some
support he needs it he needs to get
motivated to making videos again he was
good at what he did and I wish he would
do it more often it's good to see a
Jacob let's see we could ten dollar
donation from my dude Kenny D where that
coming from my dude you did not have to
do that and if you did feel like you
wanted to you should have at least asked
a question I encourage you guys if you
if you're if you want to donate ask a
question at least so you feel like
you're getting
some of your money back right in a form
of information or information I said
that really weird or whatever but thank
you for the donation I appreciate that
we have let's see all-time tech if I
boot into Android on my desktop and play
pub G mobile with keyboard and mouse
isn't cheating if you could find a way
to do that I haven't actually looked
into it but I'm sure it's possible that
would be pretty sweet the earth is not
flat my life was a lie
Jacob wants to ride naked into the mall
can you okay can you do me a favor Jacob
and please change your profile picture
like it's just the most cringy thing so
bad have you ever tried the elgato cam
link do you think you'll make a review
on it um I have not tried it I honestly
haven't but I do have another I have
what do I have I think it would ever
ever media that's the one that I have I
haven't tried any software though I just
think the software is terrible Rick a $5
donation thank you mine dude you could
ask a question though it would be cool
give me something to talk about because
right now I'm I'm running on fumes
any more questions people ask questions
let's see ali-a asked in the fractal
design r6 can i mod that adjustable
front panel to mount 120 fans on to
imitate the unreleased liam leo 11 I
wouldn't do that because they're not
gonna have any ventilation right if you
bought it you might be able to cut into
it it would be cool but at the rear
you'd also have to mod that right panel
to to get airflow beam you know to pull
in air from the back or to push it out
the back so it really depends on on how
far down the rabbit hole you're willing
to go time on that case let's see here I
see a troll xing the troll see is it
true that AMD delays the twenty hundred
ex because of intel's upcoming
core coffee lake cpu y'all bus I'm not
sure about either of those honestly I've
no clue I don't really look too far into
rumors I just wait for official releases
before I start speculating I used to do
rumors but it's just it's just hype
that's all that is it's just hype
without really solid facts unless again
we have the spec sheets official respect
sheets so Amy could be doing that I mean
look you know Intel did that when AMD
released Rison right and tell rush to
the C 370 launch the coffee leak launch
so I mean it's it's a certainly possible
I'm not going to deny a bit possibility
of that happening what are your thoughts
on I just missed it let's see I missed
it I missed it I missed it I'm so sorry
Sanjay Patel talk about the rode
videomicro I already did I have a
dedicated video on that just watch the
video that's white exist let's see I am
someone asks thoughts on computer
science degree
I have a video literally talking about
like your engineering and computer
science degrees you want to pursue any
of those I talk about my experiences in
college with them in a dedicated video
so just do a quick search on my channel
rusty ass are you hyped from watching
the raytrace Star Wars scene I mean it
looked really cool but like what I mean
the technology is cool I like I read
about ray tracing technology and like
how it actually works on a mathematical
level it's really cool I know gamers
Nexus just released a video about it so
we kind of beat me to it
that's something that I would explain
usually in like a minute science video
or a crash course video basically it it
just it uses in-game calculations and
physics to you know determine light
sources where they're bouncing off of
objects those exact angles right so you
have literal light sources in these 3d
spaces and you're you're basically
taking billions and billions of rays and
calculating their you know angles of
approaches a lot of trigonometry and
geometry involved and because you have
so many CUDA cores and so many stream
processors and your APICS cards they can
usually do these
calculations fairly quickly but the more
objects you throw in the more dynamic
the lighting scene the more difficult it
is to to calculate so yeah it did look
very cool though I like watching the
Star Wars thing just because no it's the
next thing right it's the next step it's
how we improve graphics in game now they
make a more real which is always what
we're going after we're always trying to
go after the most real thing which is
why I don't like for night anyway shots
fired
Nikon says opinion on thermal right
LeGrande macho I don't even know what
that is my dude Daniel Guthrie if your
iost arts the malfunction and or if your
computer does not come come back up from
sleep is that a good indication of a bad
CPU overclock if you if your I Oh starts
to malfunction or if your computer does
not come back up from sleep
that's strange sounds more like a
software issue you might have some
software conflicts if your if your i/o
or getting all funky and whatnot more
likely a motherboard issue it's not a
CPUs don't really die very much they
really don't so I'm just not sure if you
really want to you know if you really
want to call a CP wish you I tend to be
very careful nowadays and like diagnose
issues just because of my my past with
that NZXT hue thing you know you live
you live and you learn
you know if you'd asked me when it was
going on for a second opinion how to
told you the same thing but it's very
easy to be wrong in today's day and age
so be careful what you what you blame
it's probably not your CPU though I will
tell you that troll make trolling ttan
my question would be why are you such a
 just kidding mr. Kent is your
liquid tubing running if so better go
and catch it kind of confused but okay
thank you for that 15 CAD donation what
is that worth like two dollars and fifty
cents USB I'm just kidding I had to get
you back though alright we are scrolling
down V sky once as Greg would know the
correct answer I'm not qualified what is
this about scrolling up
growing up do you recommend selling my
organs or other people's organs no you
probably don't wanna sell your organs
unless I mean you can donate organs you
know a family member someone's dying I'm
gonna worgen donor tell you that much
like it's good I think it's a good way
to give back and you're not gonna need
your organs when you're dead you know
I've never I've never been that
sentimental about my body when I'm dead
because I'm not gonna be my body anymore
right
so I don't mind if I'm cremated if I'm
left on the side of the road if I'm
buried under a tree to give back to
mother earth like I don't really care
some people get super touchy about stuff
like that but bury me no box I don't
care all right let's see here we have if
I if I used an SSD from my old laptop in
my new PC will it boot into Windows on
my knee PC maybe maybe it probably will
but you'll have performance degradation
scroll back in the slide scream I talked
about that a bit more earlier let's see
troll mech trolling ttan SLI is useless
he continues his trolling what's the
word I'm looking for his trolling
tactics that's it yeah rusty if you love
your organs and you probably want to
sell them don't sell your organs yeah
I'm pretty sure it's illegal so don't do
that
LMFAO buried under a tree yeah there are
actually people who want that right
they'll use trees as gravestones
apparently and I don't think that's all
and only it's a bad idea I just think
it's a little sketchy right you know
because if some kid goes digging and
sees a finger in the dirt it's probably
gonna get freaked out but it's good for
the earth alright all that nitrogen it's
good for the soil so do you have any
ghost stories no but I've been scared a
couple times genuinely scared you know
when dogs and cats look at something but
then you find out that they're really
looking at nothing you can actually see
that's when I get really freaked out
because dogs they have that sense right
they can they can pick up on stuff
better than we can
and when my pups back at my parents
place you know when they start looking
at stuff that doesn't exist and our
world whatever you want to call it and
it doesn't you know we can't see with
our naked eye then I I get goose bumps
for sure that's just it's like that
pseudoscience that I am really intrigued
by because it's just you can't really
prove it I mean you got proof out there
but there's no solid evidence so it's
always cool to dive into that stuff it's
just it's a good pastime
you know Hunter Johnson asks do you have
any knowledge of the Inman 101 and would
you know if I could fit a 360 overhead
plus 240ml rad I have no knowledge of
then when 101 I don't work with and when
I've never received a new one case I
don't have an in one contact I've never
built an in wing case so there you go
Rick ass and have you ever been scammed
on Craigslist saw the eBay vid recently
okay so this is actually pretty funny I
back in high school I used to buy and
sell cell phones all the time that was
how I would test out new phones right
because I would I would buy one for 200
bucks I'd sell it for 200 bucks maybe a
little more if I could get the right
buyer in my pocket and then I would buy
something else and I would just
experiment with phones that was my thing
before I got into pcs with cell phones
and one of the potential sellers of a
cell phone it was actually an HTC One X
if you guys want to google that if you
don't know what that is there was the 1s
which was good for t-mobile and then the
One X was good for AT&amp;amp;T I believe and
the One X was a really slim phone had
like one of the best screens at the time
like the like the best screen I think on
the market at the time and I told them I
told that person that I was interested I
showed up at the the mall in my city and
he pulled the phone out and the phone
was just the phone was just not a phone
I mean it was a phone but it was like
really thick and it was shaped to look
like an HTC One X but I knew it wasn't
just based on the other videos and
pictures I had seen online so I was
pretty confident that
that this was like some one of those
knockoff Chinese brand phones and the
guy was trying to pass it off as a 1x so
I dodged a bullet there but that was one
of my closest potential scams on YouTube
with some dude trying to pass off a
phone that wasn't really a phone and I
know he knew it that's why he was trying
to get rid of it and that's why he was
selling it so cheap
the Xbox one SM one accident might be
where it comes from right the HTC with
an HTC is it affiliate with Microsoft I
feel like I feel like I should know this
I'm not sure I think there's some kind
of connection there that's why HTC
phones for the longest time had windows
on them what did they call it Windows OS
or whatever you know I gather my own dog
about anyway Jay Zack rf6 could I drop a
PC part picker link and you could tell
me you know what you think of the build
yeah but if you do that and where else
gonna probably want to do that you get I
mean dude as long as your graphics card
isn't a thousand dollars and your CPUs a
hundred dollars you're gonna be
perfectly fine we got plenty videos out
there to help you I don't think we need
to hold your hand through it if you've
done your research I mean I had videos
and that was it when I build my for a
specie I did have a friend my friend
kind of like pointed things out to me
but you know it was only a couple of
things that I wasn't sure about software
wise mainly dude the new fake iPhones
are really convincing now I want to get
my hands on one I will light it up my
video I can't wait that'll be so fun
Homer has a hatch what's up Greg I am
just chilling here on this Sunday night
I appreciate you guys stopping by
we have Wow moving frag my dude a $20
donation you guys are paying for my
lunch and then some thank you for that
his question placed our best place to
sell a PC Facebook market Craigslist
eBay background I've got a lot of
computers as a hobby you know I would
have like four of them and can't sell
any of them any advice I've been in this
position before actually where you're
sitting on inventory and you're trying
to push it out so you can move on to
other things I totally get that so if
you are working on selling three of them
let's say I would put all three of them
you want to keep it local I wouldn't do
a Bey because then you got a ship the PC
and that just sucks take my word for it
and you know if you want to ship it
right then you're gonna pay a lot for it
and usually the buyers not gonna want to
pay that extra premium so I would stick
with Craigslist and Facebook marketplace
because they're local I would post all
of them on both of those sites and then
maybe like let go or one of those other
you know used to be startup Craigslist
wannabe places that are actually pretty
big now as many places you can go as
many outlets as you can I'm selling my
car you know like I got that same thing
at cars com auto trader Craigslist you
know wherever you can get it that's
that's basically it the more exposure
you give those things the better the
better your odds for us he says you say
lunch I say a night out drinking I'll
tell you what a lot of people have been
doing that lately where I live Spring
Break in Panama City is just if you want
to blow your brains out it is so bad oh
my gosh hey Greg do you consider it's
time to upgrade from a I five sixty six
hundred K overclock to four point eight
now stick with that at least till next
generation you're perfectly fine the way
you are now gtx 1060 or gtx 1080 budget
of $2,500 if you want if you're on a
budget of 2,500 bucks and get a 1080
straight up excuse me alright computer
stores here do trades that's true but
they probably won't give you face value
for them you'll get more value selling
it aftermarket it's like if you take
your car into dealer they're gonna
lowball you cuz they got to resell it
just buy it you are just just sell it to
a private seller dmn dog asks again do
you do any enthusiasts cases have SD
memory card slots my arrow cool p7c one
did know if you wanna call it an
enthusiast case but i built a custom
loop in it that had an SD card reader so
that might be one you want to check out
kiran serie asked do you ever let a fan
buy you a drink
i haven't yet we thought we could do
something like that it kind of well I
don't unless they copy text because on
many of you running out to Taiwan for
that event the next time we're in Vegas
Shores went to a fan meetup like I'm not
a really big youtuber I get it like many
people are gonna want to go
with me if I was a bigger guys so I've
never tried to make public announcements
cuz they don't just feel too forced and
try Hardy now but I totally you know I
totally would be up for it and I mean
ever no you buy me a drink one night I
buy you a drink the other night
no homo we're good it's all good right
rip stream what's happening to stream
something wrong
Zach says rip stream what's going on
with that let's see Kenny D why do mobo
manufacture my ITX was ps2 connection
because ps2 connections are actually
still used I used to give them crap for
that but people still use ps2 they
really do it's just old school but the
response time or the input language is
just it's so seamless driverless usually
like legacy right so there's nothing
wrong with that let's see
Nasir Ali Shah you should do is rather
hang out with you Oh he'd rather hang
out with me than PewDiePie really that
is an honor I don't that I appreciate
that
here we go yes name is fine for me
thanks JP Achilles I was open stream was
fine I was kind of confused a lot of
people for saying that
yeah let's see black crow HQ is the NZXT
u+ worth it for the lighting if I use RG
Strix Edition for the GPU sure you can
look there are plenty of I mean you
could buy a cable mod kit a lot of
motherboards nowadays have dedicated RGB
headers so unless you want to do some
really fancy stuff of the hue plus you
could probably get by without it means
that it's a little expensive you might
better get a used one for cheaper but
they're good I mean I've used a couple
of them they're perfectly fine and they
definitely do the job they're intended
to do you of course get cam software as
well if you're into them intruding on
your you know system specs and whatnot I
pointed this out earlier I don't know if
you guys realize that what NZXT he did
with cam software was map all of your
performance right in all of your games
if you're using cam overlays anything
like that to monitor FPS CPU usage GPUs
ditcher they were using all that they
were storing it all in the database and
then now with the LDR build service they
have all of your statistics
their website to show you what the best
combinations of hardware are to get the
desirable framerate you want in the
games you want no pretty it's kind of I
don't know how I feel about that I mean
it's really cool that they did that it's
smart at the same time it's a little
intrusive and I'm sure it's written
somewhere in the fine print they know
nobody reads the fine for most companies
operate on that on that level so I don't
know I don't know how many people know
that but it's just that's what goes on a
lot of times a lot of companies that you
click accept to the Terms of Service for
are storing your data and they're using
it in very unique and ingenious ways
let's see Homer has a hatch asks have
you ever thought about doing a
hackintosh build that answer right now
is no because I have no use for one I
might I might in the future entertain it
but I would just end up disassembling it
flash in the drive and building
something else with it later because I
go back and talk I mean hackintosh Mac
OS is great on my laptop I love my
macbook but it's just not a desktop
thing for me I would prefer for Windows
10 as terrible as it is in some respects
I prefer that over Mac OS for my desktop
needs Kennedy thank you for that five
dollar donation my new any news on the
MDX 470 chipset should I wait for it
well I mean the only news we have really
is what we what we showed you guys the
CES it's gonna take a while for these
things to roll out I'm not sure how much
longer we're gonna be waiting I don't
have any news from that from motherboard
vendors at this point I haven't asked
frankly if you I mean you can you can
wait for it if you're talking about
waiting for just the motherboard you
don't need to but if you're talking
about waiting for the motherboard and
Rison plus or rising to whatever you
want to call it then you probably well
you know you have a better case to wait
it really just comes down to if you see
the value in purchasing now our
purchasing later I'm not you I can't
really answer that question in detail
let's see
let's see did your engineering degree
have held he'll bid help you with what
you love I think you mean help you with
what you love Kareem kind of I I'm very
I'm very honest about my degree like
it's a very niche thing I learned a lot
and just a general sense about mechanics
and physics and whatnot but I'm not a
specialist by any means when it comes to
car engines right and I can tell you how
they work and stuff but if you point to
something in the engine I'll probably
know what it is but I won't be able to
tell you indeed to how it works just
because I never went that in-depth on
the mechanical side petroleum is a very
specific concentration I can tell you
how to drill to any depth how to you
know keep production levels up I can
tell you all that because that's what I
specialized in but until I go into the
field and actually start drilling or
producing I'm really just kind of
sitting here with a degree that I'm not
using to be frank it and schools fun in
a sense because it's nice to know things
right it's it's nice to learn and say oh
yeah I know that but it's also humbling
because you realize that there's so much
more out there that you don't know that
you'll have to just really take the time
to figure out later on the greatness a
two dollar donation' mod dude thank you
a $1,500 gaming laptop is it worth it
any recommendations depends on the
laptop make sure you get it you know
most gaming laptops can have a true quad
core get the HQ processors maybe even
the six core ones right those are
starting to make their way into gaming
laptops and similar chassis so fifty
hundred bucks I'm not sure how good a
one you're gonna get make sure you got
at least eight gigs of RAM preferably
sixteen make sure got enough storage at
least a 1080p screen for Caze a little
overhyped because most $1500 gaming
laptops are gonna handle 4k anything and
make sure doesn't get too loud I don't
like to leave bulky gaming laptops
either the smaller the thinner the
better all I would probably trade off a
loud laptop for a thinner one
that's just me though let's see we have
Caden Judson he asks why do you think
there is a lack of better m ATX boards
Verizon is it not that popular anymore
I mean if we looked at the number of
people who have ATX vs MITx versus ITX I
think it would look something like this
a really huge bar for ATX and ei takes
whatever extend it and plus and then for
M ATX very small sliver tiny and then
maybe a little bigger bar for ITX so
majority always purchase ATX it's just a
general convention SLI support other
PCIe support right for capture cards and
things like that and then M ATX you
still get that support but then you're
kind of left with this awkward space in
your case unless you get a case
specifically designed for M ATX boards
and there very few of those as well so I
think it just comes down to an aesthetic
thing and I mean it kind of defeats the
purpose I mean why would you want an
m-80 X right like what is an M ATX gonna
offer you that an ATX is not I get the
ITX argument it's a small form factor
you can throw that thing into a console
shell and there you go but it may TX you
really can't do that so it's just a
tougher argument for me
we are scrolling down to I see Shahrukh
Ali a two dollar donation thank you for
that opinion on hacking Tasha's I hate
to tell you this too but I literally
answered this like 10 minutes ago I'm
gonna spare my other viewers who have
been watching the whole time
scroll back about 10 minutes I talked
about hacking Tasha's and why I haven't
built one just yet scrolling down again
we have kjw 2804 thank you for that too
it's--that's pounds thank you for that
two-pound donation my dude is an i5 2500
a reasonable upgrade from an FX 6100 I
mmm
depends on how much you're gonna spend
I'm not sure I haven't tested the 2500
wood ivory bridge right but I'm pretty
sure that you're gonna see a frame rate
jump but how much of a jump I'm not too
sure so it depends on how much you're
gonna spend on the new platform because
you have to swap motherboards and CPUs
to do that so maybe more of a side grade
not too sure
let's see we have the nuclear brony is
the in wind is the is the Windows 10
product key connected to the motherboard
or do I need a new key when I swap my
boot SSD and it's not connected the
motherboard and that in that way it's
it's all stored on your on your drive so
if you take the drive from one PC and
pop it in another PC you should have no
problem with the activation you might
have something to show up later every
now and then I use keys and I'll still
get like you need to activate Windows
every now and then I'll just have to
keep cycling through settings eventual
it'll disappear just restart your PC to
disappear but Windows 10 is finicky like
that but you will have performance
degradation if you swap your drive from
one PC to another unless it's like the
exact same platform you're just
upgrading CPUs or something keep that in
mind I talked about that earlier in the
stream scroll back if you want to hear
about it Joe asked if I got married yes
I did I got married to my beautiful wife
Lisa how long ago was it I wasn't too
long ago actually and yeah she's in
Germany which sucks and she kind of have
to go back but we're working on stuff
now trying to figure out where we want
to live and what we're gonna do with our
lives it's pretty cool though it's like
a blank slate I have let's see Eddie
Sawyer's would you buy a gaming
motherboard on eBay sure like I mean
I've bought used motherboards before I
bought refurbished motherboards before
they're perfectly fine in most cases do
you listen to podcast if so which ones I
don't actually I prefer video
I prefer seeing someone's face it's just
more relatable for me
what's the natio via this and via cincy
oh wow
should I format my PC every so often not
really not unless it's getting really
slow and yet a lot of programs bogging
it down but then you could just delete
those programs right also startup
programs and your task manager turn some
of those off it'll make your PC boot up
quicker you won't have as much lag in
the beginning
let's see here I am scrolling down some
more
troll mcdhh rolling Tennille do you
really that's not the case that's pretty
inappropriate you know what I'm gonna
you know what they go boom you're in
timeout there you know it's having a PC
case necessary I've got an ugly
pre-built and can't afford to buy a case
right now and I can't then looking at a
banged-up HP case is it safe to leave my
components on top of a desk yeah but you
probably don't want to do that I mean if
you spill anything on anything
components you touch any components the
moving fans it's just a slippery slope
Monday dude ah let's see should I use a
VPN for online gaming not unless you're
worried about like you know if you want
those guys that has a tinfoil hat on
every time walks outside you probably
want to do that but unless you're doing
some really weird stuff when you're
caming you probably don't need a people
worried about it too much
VPNs are a good practice in general but
just for gaming I think it's a little
too much scrolling down scrolling down
will the 8900 k be on the same chip set
as the 8700 k I've even heard about that
processor I don't know where the heck
golden game or you're getting your info
dude but I don't read rumors I'm not
sure if until it's put out any official
statement but I don't look at stuff like
that unless it's official let's see
scrolling down ray Kaena wants me to say
his name so there you go Baha hey man
I'm gonna build PC just for gaming do I
need I 5 or i7 Baha I literally have a
video answer in this question it was
actually pretty recent and another video
it's about a year old that answers a
question as well those answers still
apply now so go back and watch those
Grega please say my name I already did I
forgot it's too late sorry sorry about
that less than trace isn't good to buy a
prebuilt PC right now I'm pretty sure
you already know the answer to that
question if you have to ask it it's
probably a good time
venomous teddy mr. Sal
what are your in interest outside of
computer I play guitar I like I like
playing soccer played I used to play a
lot of sports when I was younger not so
much anymore
I used to go to the gym a lot I was a
lot bigger than I am now
I'm trying to get back into that role
let's see here we have the X 4 9 9 I'm
pretty sure the chips that's gonna
change for that one power delivery
issues and whatnot we have Frank Dopp 27
gaming on APU 24 is that I don't know
okay I think you're answering someone
else's question Bob ha literally type in
i5 versus i7 for gaming I guess all you
got to do
I shouldn't have to hold your hand
through this process please answer my
question please it it's in my donation
thing I did shower shower good guy came
and say that shower our MDOT are I can't
see your question so if you asked a
question I didn't see it let's see oh I
see it right here
here we go can you make a video on a GPU
like a complete guide EGP you sure
eventually I do a cover song maybe I
actually already have a video on the
channel to be playing a little guitar
it's nothing fancy I just put it up
there because I was having some fun
let's see hey Greg do you think it's too
late to sell my RX 480 for $400 or more
that's yeah sure I mean you could try if
you really want to try sure why not
thanks Frank top 27 appreciate that
Cecil ass would there be any benefit or
is it possible to use the Vega course on
a rise in G processor for physics if you
were to get a decent graphics card good
question I've seen this question before
and I'm not too sure if that's possible
I know you can do it with discrete cards
but I don't and you can set your CPU as
a whole to calculate physics
I don't know if you can separate the
Vega cores from the actual I haven't
done my research that I'll have to check
it out
but that would be an interesting topic I
don't think it would benefit you very
much unless you're playing really like
you know PhysX intensive games and even
then you probably won't see too big a
difference let's see the greatness a $5
donation mod dude thank you for that
should I go with dual 1080 T eyes for 4k
or just keep my single 10 DT I have and
an i7 7700 K depends on the 4k game
you're gonna max out 4k probably want to
but moderate you know medium to high ish
settings in 4k at 60 Hertz 110 eighties
the eyes of me plenty excuse me you can
get new 5 80s for under 350 yeah so you
probably want to sell your RX 40 for 400
you can try but you might not get what
you want for it
Jeff shoemaker hi I've always watched
your channel for about a couple years
now and I watched tech stuff I started
by not knowing anything about pcs but
today I've learned so much and built my
own PC without a struggle that Jeff is
exactly why I like doing what I'm doing
not only get to be my own boss that's a
huge perk but seeing those kinds of
testimonials people who say hey your
videos really helped me with this it
changed the way I looked at this topic I
now know more than I did before because
of this video that's super awesome I
love that like that's exactly what I
hope to hear from you guys when I
release videos and and answer questions
like these in live streams so thank you
for telling me that I appreciate that I
am scrolling down some more how familiar
are you with quantum physics rusty I
already have a video kinda talking about
quantum mechanics quantum physics in
general is not something I really do it
into in my physics classes that's more
or less it's not I mean it's theoretical
physics in the sense that you know
predicting electron paths and electron
placements is not something that I
studied very much in college to be frank
but it is a very interesting subject I
know a lot about nuclear physics but not
very much about quantum mechanics and it
just it never piqued my interest the
same way nuclear physics did because
nuclear physics right we get we get an
end result from that right
we get nuclear processes we can see
happen in real time quantum mechanics is
a it's a very intangible thing it's a
very theoretical the math involved is
just it's really bad I see someone else
to ban from the channel there you go
I'm sure he's gonna love me now let's
see how come you change back to science
to do ask Miguel see I already answered
that question a long time ago a long
time ago I'm sorry you guys probably
frustrated I'm not answering those
questions that I already up videos for
but that's why the videos exist if you
want the answers to those questions you
got to watch the videos that's not what
these live streams are for these are for
questions I haven't answered yet or
maybe like circumstantial things like it
you guys are having problems with PCs
and whatnot oh let's see
killer phobia call me stupid but it was
thanks to you and your video that I was
able to install an AI Oh
I mean look that's you know I get it I
was there when I was a noob I had no
clue what I was doing I'm just like do I
use these screws do I use these screws I
had no idea like three m6m fan screws
PSU screws there's six M screws I think
- they're just you know it's it gets
overwhelming at times at this point you
know it's pretty straightforward but in
the beginning it's definitely difficult
so no shame in that mud you the X al hey
going to be building a PC soon do you
think I should go with an Intel i5 7600
K or some sort of 8th gen Intel CPU I
just be doing 1080p gaming 7600 K is
gonna be plenty for 1080p gaming you
could go with an 8th gen CPU but if you
I mean if you can get the 7 second ok
for cheap I would go with that you can
overclock it 4 cores is plenty for
gaming in almost all situations with an
overclock you're gonna be perfectly fine
with few exceptions maybe battlefield 1
that's what most people like to point
out Cecil I already answered your
question so I'm not sure why you're
asking it again let's see here we have a
question from Ma three questions that's
a lot of questions I'll answer one of
them what would you do with an extra PC
not streaming or storage server and what
do you want to see in future cases ma I
literally have
video talking about future case designs
like I literally have a video on that so
scroll back like 10 or 15 video you guys
are like showing up to the live streams
but you're not watching all the videos I
upload you got to do that if you want
these questions answered I push I
publish these videos so that you guys
don't have to ask questions like eat so
watch them I'm not I'm not even telling
you this so that I can get you know a
fraction of a penny from your viewership
I'm telling you this so that we can you
know learn more quicker and not have to
waste time answering these questions
I've already answered indicative videos
and these live streams let's see
rowdy gamer says you have donation link
up in the description of the video but
you're not taking donations yeah I'm not
really I turn that off because it's just
weird
super chats are cool if you get super
chats like you get something out of it
so you want to donate you super chat
it's the same freaking thing like
there's no point in keeping both on it's
stupid
are you a full time tuber and what is
your favorite youtuber yes cream on a
full-time tech tuber right now and I am
in school though I'm getting my masters
in business admin right now
but I'm a full-time student and a
full-time youtuber but yeah that's it
favorite youtuber I don't know I watch a
lot of them it's difficult to pick one
how many cores do you really need for
gameplay recording I have a video on
that check it out it's like I have
literally have videos on most of the
stuff you guys are asking about what
Rison processor and GPU would you
recommend for modern streaming bc i have
a video on that too but i'll tell you
right now at least an r5 cpu and at
least a 1070 joshua smith says I'm
living in the Caribbean and I'm
prioritizing opponents in the clearing
wait the case is roughly 200 US dollars
and I don't think it's worth it if I can
protect my components so you're asking
if you could if you should use a case or
not I'm not sure if that's your question
so it's a weird question you don't need
a case but you should be really careful
if you don't use one sorry my voice is
getting really choppy right now mmm you
let me talk too long it's just like now
seer just asked engineering and business
why
dude because that's the best of both
worlds necessary if you go to any look
at any major tech company out there I
guarantee you a lot of those upper level
management people have engineering
degrees and then some sort of master's
in business or finance or something
along those lines it is the the it's a
deadly combo it really is because it
tells companies you can not only manage
money and predict cash flows but you can
also work hands on to an extent at least
as much as you remember and retain from
class an extent to which you can work on
the components for the people that
you're usually looking over right that
you're having to manage so that's why
let's see Willie thinks I'm being really
mean and rude I'm sorry if I hurt your
feelings Willie I'm so sorry
if you think that's being mean and rude
guys come along you serious it's our
Howard hey brother what's going on my
dude thanks for stopping by how is this
shirt so white I think it's the lighting
from the screen I'm pretty sure you guys
are just seeing a little reflection from
the UH from the screen as all that is
why did you change your channel name I
changed it a long time ago I don't know
why you're asking that now I changed it
a long time ago I have a video talking
about that golden gamer with what you
have learned in engineering is it
physically possible to build a mech like
Iron Giant or Mechagodzilla you would
need a very hefty power source and some
really heavy but efficient motors or
however else you think you're gonna turn
those joints that's really um it's
really all I can say I mean like you got
a power-to-weight thing right you got a
war he thought though you're gonna have
enough power in those motors to lift
really heavy joints like an Iron Giant
not too sure rusty Shackelford have you
ever thought about information security
before you picked a degree that's mad
money now because my degree in petroleum
engineering pays more than that and
that's why I pursued it I'm granted the
energy the energy sector right now I was
a little too topsy-turvy but
that's I mean I'm getting my masters
anyway right now so I'm not too worried
about entering the workforce at this
point but just do a quick Google search
of petroleum engineering you guys will
see why I picked it it's a really
high-paying special specialty it's you
know it's not just a mechanical
engineering degree right we specialize
in drilling and production and
everything associated with that and it's
I mean it's it's hazardous right I mean
you guys hear the stories and we get a
lot of flack for it because when we do
mess up the spotlights on us for a long
time but it's really cool it's really
fun I enjoy the geology side of as well
I love studying the earth how the earth
works how it functions why we were able
to live on this planet how old are you I
answered that earlier sube but it is uh
I am 23 there's your answer
let's see yeah in Trix asked if I saw
his super chat I don't maybe I didn't
answer it let's see I don't see it
Oh in Trix go buy yourself an ice-cream
with this money $2 Aussie is that
Australian dollars ain't not like a
dollar u.s. I might not even be able to
buy an ice cream today
let's see Ryan asked will you ever will
you do another minute science video like
you used to do when you started YouTube
Ryan I've uploaded minute science videos
lately quite a bit oh you guys are
thinking like what's going on you guys
are you guys watching the videos I
upload minute science videos I try to do
at least one a week if not I'll do a
crash course video but they're very
similar in design ones just more in
depth than the other Kareem did you ever
want to review smart phones I've
reviewed smart phones on the channel the
hidden link I'm into engineering and
science what field do you recommend a
senior to pursue the hidden link I have
a video talking about this should you
consider an engineering degree that
would probably help you out that I think
is gonna be something that you would
finally useful all right I see you
Adarsh is the new h3 10 motherboard
worth it for an 8400 don't know I
haven't gotten my hands on nature 310
yet but I'm sure it's perfectly fine as
long as it's got the features that you
want
then you'll probably be okay but you got
to look at the future sets right and
that's a subjective thing I can't really
answer that question for you beyond that
let's see um am Amin Ben what are some
key things to disable to improve
performance for someone still using an
HDD as a primary drive and can't afford
an SSD I'm actually gonna make a video
on that very soon so stay tuned for that
the biggest issue is page filing right
with hard drives it can affect
performance so I want to talk a bit
about that why it affects performance in
game and and what you can do to mitigate
that Gordon Evans I start chiropractic
chiropractic school in September let me
know if you need anything in three years
awesome dude I will yeah seriously I'll
take you up on that have you ever tried
streaming through g85 yes Jason I did
about four streams ago and it was okay
but I don't think it's worth it you're
gonna have that methylamine shipped my
way soon I need it for my next batch
good old Walter White
I love to see an image I see him in the
comments of some videos - I love it I
love the context that's a good play mr.
Walter I appreciate you stopping by MRX
kik do you know of any good headphones
non-gaming in a hundred dollar range not
really I think my Bose had said the
noise canceling both had said that I use
for like travel like plane rides and
stuff I'm pretty sure those are 200
bucks
I don't usually try to go with Chiefs
$100 because in my opinion the extra
hundred bucks justifies the better
quality usually the noise cancelling
ability and the sound clarity I guess
it's the one I should say hmm
TCO 11 a dynamic video yes I teased it
and it is coming soon rusty Shackelford
hey Greg it's time to cook that's right
it is time to cook I'm freaking hungry
what is your current smartphone I have
the LGV 30 as my current smartphone
totally want some of that blue I love
you guys I love you guys know the
kinetic context that's awesome
death Ram latency matter for 2400 Hertz
it kind of an open-ended question dude
and what in what scenario I mean caste
latency doesn't matter to an extent but
it matters more under certain
circumstances what's your favorite movie
or show Breaking Bad that should have
answered that question a little earlier
maybe didn't get context I get it but
yeah Breaking Bad is my that's my show
will you ever do a video comparing
knives for unboxing even though we know
that mclovin - katana wins oh you got me
killer phobia I see what's going on oh
where did McLovin go he stopped by for
like 10 minutes and then he bailed this
guy what's your favorite song on guitar
I don't really know I don't really know
how to be honest that's tough question
it's like I asked me like my favorite
song of all time my favorite band of all
times Breaking Benjamin and then second
is probably Bring Me The Horizon my
darkest days when they were still a
thing before a singer got stolen yeah
and then three days grace was never
really the same I miss Adam I really do
he's like oh my god he answered my
question be diligent I will get there
I'll try super troop aha sup Greg can
you please tell me what's wrong with my
logitech webcam it keeps disconnecting
and reconnecting itself I've tried
updating drivers and stuff please I need
help
have you swapped USB ports I got to ask
it just to make sure make sure there's
nothing you know there aren't any
improper contacts in the USB connection
itself from the camera you might just
have a faulty one if you've updated
drivers I'm assuming you haven't
conflicting try different PC make sure
it's not your PC and something software
related with your PC maybe it's the
motherboard you never know
so isolate your variables and if you've
isolated everything and you cannot you
know conclude that it's anything else
other than the camera that's probably
the camera RMA it send me in 79 80 79 80
XE e thank you maybe
maybe what's the best budget components
right now for an $800 PC build I 5
horizon 5 GTX 1060 1050 Ti around there
it's about the best you can do in this
current market Audio Technica MX 40s are
about 80 bucks and are pretty good yeah
audio Technica's are really good
Jaqueline that's actually a good good
point audio Technica's you know I use an
80/20 35 great microphone my brother has
a noise-canceling headset from 80 and
I'm pretty sure that was like at around
a higher bucks so and they're they're
noise canceling technology is actually
pretty good too bose is a little
overkill you'll get that like weird like
you know pressure buildup in your ears
when you use those no I can't noise
canceling headset for a while or their
technology is a little overbearing
but it works really well especially on
planes what happens if you put a higher
Ram speed than stock in a gaming laptop
stock is 2133 but there was also an
option for 2400 I'm wanting to go 2666
and then the BIOS there is an auto
feature you can do that I mean that's
the thing like if you swap RAM your BIOS
is gonna know you did and if I usually
reset your BIOS right so you'll have
complete stock settings and any rover
clocks or calibrations fan curves any of
that will be reset so then you can go in
and see how high you can go just
troubleshoot it play with your cast
latencies you wanna get really technical
your timings but Ram overclocking is
really an ish thing for most people good
morning from South Africa uh thanks
Matthews I appreciate you watching the
stream this early almost time for safari
awesome page thanks for watching I
appreciate that gaming laptops seem like
an option now rather than trying to
build a new system yeah I mean to an
extent you can make that case
sure and there's the portability factor
too yeah maybe maybe that's a topic for
a future video
Audio Technica is the best it's Kraken
heck yeah it's awesome alright I'm
building a desktop soon I need to know
if an r5 1600 is better at streaming
than an i-5 8400 an or i3 8100 come on
bro
Evan you come on brah
6 cores 12 threads versus 4 cores 4
threads and 6 cores 6 threads I mean
just process of elimination you probably
narrow down just to the RFI of in the
i-5 and then from there I have videos
talking about the performance benefits
with Verizon 5 and i-5 CPUs so you can
check that out if you want more info
that's a topic that I literally have a
dedicated video for because it's just
very in-depth hello from Australia ad
tick
Obie's it Obie's it I appreciate you
watching I'm down under good to see ya
great videos buddy thank you for your
help online question I play FPS and have
a 27 inch Asus 1440p 1440p 144 Hertz
1080p screen is it worth it to upgrade
wait is it worth it to upgrade to 1440p
144 Hertz at 27 inches 1080p and 1440
Peter can look pretty similar I don't
think it's worth the upgrade unless
you're going with like a 32 inch panel
and even then you have to sit pretty
close to your screen to discern 1440p
from 1080 so you can look at optimal
viewing distances for both it's just
gonna really depend let's see Suvarna
check crop VAR t I guess I said that
right 300 do whatever that is thanks for
the donation I appreciate it do you
still use the I 373 2k to cut open boxes
or have you given yourself an upgrade to
that department no I still do
if you watch my Coolermaster this case
right here the H 500 P mesh watch that
video there's an easter egg in there how
much is that donation worth in CAD any
big difference between ddr3 and ddr4 Ram
and gaming not not really not too big a
difference to be completely honest you
probably won't notice it greetings from
Sidney Greg hardcore hardware thank you
for watching I appreciate you stopping
by fellas gidday from Australia that
Aussie guy what's up all the Australia
hopping in the stream I appreciate you
guys or maybe you're just like now
revealing yourself it's pretty cool I
appreciate that ultimate battle between
the AI 373 50k and McClellan's katana
please we could probably chop it in half
if we swung hard enough we definitely
could Jacksonville is killing me with
this cold weather Florida please get
your stuff together yep it's cold here
in Florida too we're a little west of
you guys but it's freezin sorry about
that
okay couple more questions we're gonna
call it quits my voice is shot I am
hurting I'm really hurting oh oh alright
we have let's see I try to get people we
did you hear about Intel's new 10 core
20 thread I 329 million K I have not yet
but I'll be sure to I'll be sure to
Google that what happened to McLovin
Homer people asked us literally every
live stream he has a job he has a life
he doesn't work for me he's got to make
money so that's what he's doing
have you ever had a problem with black
screens after you have installed a new
GPU from lord williams every now and
yeah look if your if your fans on your
graphics card are turning you're getting
power to the card then you might either
be coming from your HD or from your
discrete graphics not discrete graphics
sorry your integrated graphics if you
have integrated graphics on board and if
you're not trolly other ports and if
that's still not working then yeah
you're probably gonna have to I don't
know that's that's tough I read about
once I think and just reset all my
components and then it started working
again it's really difficult to diagnose
those things okay one more question one
more question here we go
Chandan ready he says can I leave a
custom loop PC unattended for like five
days a week I'm scared that it'll leak
because it'll be my first custom loop
but it must be the same feeling for
every first-timer right look let it run
for 24 hours non-stop
watch it for the first hour if it leaks
it's gonna leak usually within the first
hour but just let it run you know I
wouldn't let it run over
if you're not that confident about it
it's what I do is usually just play
games on it I let the loop heat up and
let those pipes stick - those are rings
you probably won't have a leak that's
that's what I usually do you get a warm
of the system you know get it broken in
and then you'll be good oh we got an
email all right um all right I hope you
guys like the new format with stream
labs it's just I mean it's pretty
bare-bones I know I get it but I hope
you guys enjoy at least the animations
and the fact that you can see your chat
and the live stream it gives it a more
personal touch - you guys can see
yourselves on stream of course you
always have trolls come by I just
blocked them right away so that's just a
product of having the chat on stream but
at the same time it encourages you guys
to contribute and to stay active on the
channel thanks Robert
McVoy mcveigh for subscribing those have
been popping up every now and then
during the livestream it's just a
another thing about stream labs that I'm
very proud of at this point I literally
put this together in like an hour so
what you're seeing is and how our earth
of work anyway thanks you guys for
watching he says my god his boss by Greg
love your videos dude Thank You Miguel
see he says he likes the setup VCI one
good night Greg have a good one thanks
thank you guys for watching and I will
like I said catch when the next one will
do this next week again I did it last
week cuz it was Easter here in the
States and elsewhere so I didn't do it
then spending time with family but this
week I'm good I got some tests to study
for and then next week I will also be
good so stay tuned for next week's live
stream and I start it again at around 9
p.m. CST that is 10 p.m. est and
depending where you live any other time
possible so that's it I hope you guys
enjoyed the live stream I'll catch you
in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
