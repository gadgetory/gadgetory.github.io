go to ww-where space comm and tack on a
forward slash science studio for 10% off
your first purchase so this video right
here a classic comparison between the
Apple MacBook Pro 2017 base model and
the Dell XPS 13 now the Dell XPS 13 is
actually almost fully loaded I don't
have the 1 terabyte in vme SSD in here
just the 512 kit but it does have 16
gigs of ram and the core i7 7500 u on
the opposite side this macbook pro 13
inch model is the most basic of the
MacBook Pros that you can buy so not
only is it the 13-inch model not the
15-inch one but it also has the most
basic specification lineup you can
possibly arrange for a macbook this cost
around twelve hundred and fifty to
thirteen hundred dollars and this one
cost about $1,500 so just from a price
to performance standpoint you're
obviously getting more with the Windows
laptop that's pretty standard though
what else are you getting though are you
getting the better build quality here or
here how about the better keyboard the
better operating system the better
performance overall especially with the
operating systems taken into account I'm
gonna talk about all that this video I
purchased both of these laptops and by
the way out of pocket so I am by no
means biased just for the sake of being
biased because a company sent me one I
purchased both of these myself and I'm
gonna tell you exactly how I feel about
both in this video
one of the first differences you'll
notice between the Dell XPS and the
MacBook Pro is the difference in build
quality so Dell took a unique approach
here that decided to sandwich a
carbon-fiber slab in between two
aluminum panels the carbon fiber is a
welcome feature I think it sets this
laptop apart from its competition at
least in the window space it does though
have a rubbery consistency doesn't feel
as premium as I think it should and also
is a fingerprint and oil magnet on the
macbook pro side though the inside the
back panel and the top panel are all
made out of aluminum you'll find a solid
piece on top same at the back and same
with the front this build is just I
really think it's next to none I think
the build quality of the macbook pro is
superior to that of the XPS 13 s only
because everything is just so well
crafted the macbook pro has just a very
minimalistic appeal and i am ok with
that just look at the back panel how
plain it is let's see him I try to open
both laptops with one finger and ok XPS
is moving a bit nope it didn't open ok
for the MacBooks seamless another
superior quality of the macbook pro its
enormous trackpad some people think it's
a little too big but I don't mind the
extra real estate here I mean really
this is wasted space other than that
unless you have like a fingerprint
sensor or something down here so I like
the extra space it's a very smooth
trackpad the glass is seamless and I
also like the little haptic engine I
have built into these literally the
opposite can be said of the XPS 13 's
trackpad it does feel fairly smooth but
it is considerably smaller than the
MacBooks and I don't like the actual
physical clicks of left and right on the
traffic once you use a MacBook trackpad
it's really difficult to go back to
anything else the next set of
differences I want to discuss have to do
with these keyboards and the Mac books
lately have gotten a bad rap over there
butterfly switches but there are two
different generations you should keep in
mind the first generation was
implemented in the 2015-16 MacBook 12
inch models I think they're still
implemented in the MacBook 12 inch
series and those switches really had no
key travel no actuation it kind of felt
like you were just typing on a solid
desk I was getting used to it I'll admit
but now that I have enjoyed gen 2
switches for quite a while I've got to
say I really like the feeling of his
keyboard it sounds weird it doesn't look
like you would enjoy this keyboard
because the keys
don't move very far at all but I like
the feeling of these better than they do
of the XPS their teens keyboard it's
it's just my preference I don't like the
mushy feeling of the chiclet keyboard
here on the XPS 13 key travel is
considerably higher but it just it feels
like a typical membrane keyboard you
know the keys kind of wobble off on side
to side and it it just doesn't give you
that satisfying feeling both keyboards
are also fitted with LED backlights the
Mac books are a bit more pronounced and
they don't have too much of bleed around
the keys the XPS 13 czar the complete
opposite really just depends on what you
want aesthetically here now when it
comes to screens this is where things
are gonna get fairly subjective if you
want to touch screen you got to pay more
for it on the XPS 13 if I had gotten
this fully loaded but without the
touchscreen this laptop would literally
cost as much as the MacBook Pro does
this is the base model keep that in mind
so this 3200 by 1800 resolution XO panel
is a very beautiful display I'd say the
colors are fairly accurate you can see
the color gamut here in comparison I
like the touch screen capabilities of
the XPS 13 I think it's a nice addition
and it's hard to go from a touchscreen
laptop back to one that doesn't have
that capability but I will say that the
trackpad of the MacBook Pro does make up
for some of this loss
it gets considerably brighter than the
XPS their teens and is also slightly
larger but again does not have any
touchscreen capability another perk of
the XPS 13 in this category is its near
bezel list display this is what Dell
calls its infinity display and it's
super beautiful I've got to say it's
difficult to jump from this back to a
laptop with average bezels like the
MacBook Pro 13s they just seemed super
thick just like wasted space in
comparison to what Dell has done with
the XPS 13 and it's 15 for that matter
something else to note the MacBook Pro
suffers from a bit more backlight bleed
on this IPS display the bottom left-hand
quarters especially pronounced the XPS
13 doesn't have too much of that at all
regarding your concerns on battery life
the MacBook will generally last about an
hour or so longer just with daily use if
you want to talk about just Netflix in
general using Google Chrome to stream
Netflix will result in about 45 minutes
or so of extra battery life on the
MacBook Pro both of these displays at 50
percent brightness and then if you want
to look at it from just a software
opportunistic standpoint the XPS 13 has
the ability
to download the Netflix app from the
Microsoft Windows Store which means that
you'll have considerably less overhead
there than you will using a browser like
Google Chrome which has been known to
utilize resources in questionable ways
so using Chrome to stream Netflix Safari
to stream Netflix and also the Netflix
app on the XPS 13 the exbest was
actually able to pull out just a bit
more battery life from the Netflix app
because it does have less overhead than
both Safari and Chrome do on the macbook
both of these laptops are sporting ultra
low power cable H CPUs which means that
h.265 encoding decoding on Netflix and
high resolutions like 4k will result in
slightly less battery being consumed in
the long run the MacBook Pros i5 does
fall a bit short of the XPS is i7 but
these are literally almost the exact
same CPU that same core same thread
count one it just clocked a bit higher
bend a bit higher which means slightly
better performance out of the XPS but I
would say in most general cases you
won't tell a difference between the two
once more the MacBook Pros Intel IR S
Plus graphic 640 gives it an extra punch
in games if you're willing to play to
resolution lower the native something
like 720p you can actually maintain
steady frame rates as for the XPS well
not too shabby in any game including
dota 2 other features of the XPS 13 kind
of just a walk-around review at this
point an LED notification light up front
in front of the trackpad which will turn
orange if your battery life gets low
around 10 percent or so on the right
side of the laptop an SD card slot which
I wish the MacBook had this is really
good for content creators there's a
speaker over here on the right side also
a USB 3.0 hub with power share on the
left side you'll find the power
connector a USB type-c port with
Thunderbolt three capabilities another
USB 3.0 hub and a headphone jack also a
battery notification light which is
super cool to tell you how much battery
have left in your laptop you don't even
have to open it up to figure that out
the other speaker is on this side as
well with the MacBook Pro nothing really
to show off here nothing on the bottom
nothing really on top except a shiny
Apple logo that does not light up any
more on the left side of the laptop
there are two USB type-c ports and on
the opposite side just a single
headphone jack
kind of weird that there's a headphone
jack on the macbook pro but not on the
iPhone 7 there are a few remedies here
though you could of course carry
dongles around which I just yeah it's
a fact of life via MacBook with type-c
ports but these become just a hassle to
carry around especially we have multiple
dongles and on top of that if you lose
one you're kind of screwed so a company
called dot case has quote revolutionized
the way that we look at dongles and
MacBook Pro accessibility so they've
taken a case literally a thick a faux
leather case and they've included i/o
ports for HDMI Ethernet USB type A and
an SD card slot you even get two
additional type-c ports for whatever
else you can hook up like ten dot cases
together and have an unlimited supply of
i/o ports I am surprised that no
well-known company has done this yet for
the 13 inch and 15 inch MacBook Pros
dock case has these sleeves for both
model sizes and I'm gonna say this is
just a very cohesive product I really
like how simple it is to use I I'm not
the biggest fan of the fact that you
have to plug in a small type C to type-c
connector to link your macbook to the
dock case but hey it's better than not
having those IO ports they've actually
got a kick start at running that will
end in a few days they surpassed their
goal a long time ago this tells you how
much hype there is behind this product
how simple it is to use and just how
effective it is as well so if you want
to contribute anyway you can find their
Kickstarter link in the video
description just something else to kind
of throw into the mix to show that well
there are solutions coming out for the
MacBook Pro peripheral issue now here's
the fun part I'm going to bring up both
of these cameras and I'm gonna show you
how terrible both of them are okay so
I'm recording with both laptops you can
see how orientations are definitely
different here so the MacBook has a just
a very generic location for the camera
up top and it's resolution is subpar
audio is not bad though the XPS 13
totally different story only is the
audio not that great but the camera
positioning is super bad because of this
like minimalistic bezel design that
Dells implemented which i think is
beautiful but it does compromise camera
location that's why I have to awkwardly
like point it up super high so you can
see my face I'm really not a fan of
either of these and four laptops that
cost over $1000 each they're just subpar
there's really no other word for them
something else to note about the XPS 13
that I've documented in a dedicated
video check it out right here is the
coil whine this laptop has insane coil
on and it's pretty much a common thing
check forms regarding XPS 13 s a lot of
people experienced this issue and this
laptop is no exception coil line gets
soul
sometimes I really wish you could hear
it in the microphone just have a listen
to how bad this sounds
both of these laptops do have built-in
fans of course the XPS s do turn on a
bit more and they're also slightly
louder I think that just has to do with
the low overhead of OS 10 also mac books
have been known to get super hot before
their fans turn on because Apple wants
this super quiet appeal right this is a
silent laptop or a silent as it can be
but that does result in your lap getting
super hot sometimes I'm serious you
could end up with third-degree burns if
you set this on your lap when it's under
full load
here's another distinction sound quality
coming from the speakers the XPS 13 Czar
decent but they get pretty trebly past
around 40% volume the MacBook speakers
are incredible here's the XPS 13 s at
full volume
and here are the MacBook Pro speakers at
full volume
so I would say yeah MacBook Pro speakers
win by a long shot the last things to
discuss with each of these than their
operating systems at this point it's
difficult for me to advocate for Windows
10 laptop and an ultra low power CPU
like this only because look this fan
will spoil up if I open up something as
simple as the taskbar I'm not even
joking this thing will spool up and get
pretty hot because CPU utilization
reaches 50 60 % just with task manager
open
whereas with OS 10 things don't get very
hot because the operating system is
already low profile I'm also a huge fan
of optimization on Mac OS I use Final
Cut Pro all the time when I'm on the go
also iMovie iMovie still results in
better render times than an equivalent
file with Adobe Premiere on the XPS 13
and this is what 16 gigs of ram twice as
much as this one and an i7 versus an i-5
my personal pick between the two it's
got to be the MacBook Pro and it's only
because I use this on the go I'm a video
editor I do that for a living and I want
to have the best experience possible
this provides that it's just much easier
to use these programs with the very
large trackpad the excellent battery
life and the low system overhead you
might crucify me for saying that but in
a mobile sense I do prefer Mac OS I
prefer a MacBook Pro over an XPS 13 or
the like I use Windows in the studio
because well I need Windows to run some
of the programs that I use to bring you
content when I actually create stuff
where I am now but when I'm on the go
this is really all I need sure you get
better specs more bang for your buck
with the Windows laptop then you do with
an equally priced MacBook or MacBook Pro
but that's not really the point here the
programs that I need is a content
creator when I'm not in the studio are
better suited on the MacBook Pro in fact
you can't even use Final Cut Pro on a
Windows laptop so that kind of rules
things out there there are pros and cons
to each obviously different user bases
different intents but for what I do as a
content creator
I much prefer Final Cut Pro on the go I
also prefer the fast
render times with that software here
because you can't get it on the
equivalent Windows laptop if you liked
this video or at least appreciate my
opinions be sure to give this video a
thumbs up do appreciate that be sure to
give this one a thumbs down if you feel
