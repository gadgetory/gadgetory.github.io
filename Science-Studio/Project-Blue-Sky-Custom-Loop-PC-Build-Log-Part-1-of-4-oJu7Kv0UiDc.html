cooling gear sent straight from Germany
straight out of Germany this is all the
aqua tuning stuff alpha cool components
primarily actually I think everything is
from alpha cool they were super generous
and sent over pretty much everything
that I wanted they just told me to have
at it just pick what I wanted and then
they send it over so huge shout out to
them they are the biggest sponsor by far
in this series of videos by the way I
think I'm only going to break this into
probably three parts so today will do
the unboxing will run through the
components I'll be using and then we'll
probably just put the water blocks onto
the graphics cards and the CPU and call
it a day and then in part two we will
install the radiator put everything in
the case as well as the fittings kind of
plan out the loop although we do already
have a plan you can check that out where
it can be over here filled and then a
part 3 will be the bends and fluid in
molten fluid insulated the bends and
then pipe insulation or the PE GG tubing
that we'll be using and then fill in
that bad boy up with the fluid all
righty
have a look inside here okay so there
were they're sending over everything so
hey we even get a heat gun hard our tube
heat gun pro 2000 watt that's what I'm
talking about so I'm just probably more
stuff in here than I'm honestly going to
need I don't know what's in this is
there something in here let's see what
this is all anti-static mat they
actually send one leave an anti-static
mat so we can actually work on
everything properly by convention here
Oh Oh there's a coolant I mean obviously
I'm trying to figure out what brand it
is I guess this is just alpha cool
generic brand of a coolant another one
of those that's good so I'm expecting to
have tons of these boxes here these are
fittings of course then you know vital
component for any custom loop tons of
those here I also got some very
cool-looking
Bionic loops fans that are going to be
blue I hope that's the high-end fitting
series so tons check these out tons of
fittings in here like I said they hooked
us up so we should have a surplus I'm
hoping we have a surplus buddy of mine
water cools builds all the time touch
some loops and that he told me that it's
more than likely you'll end up with not
enough that's why I went overboard here
is our reservoir and I think our pump is
in here too if I'm not mistaken check
this out so one three 60ml radiator full
copper that's my metal of choice I
recommend copper and another one so this
want to go on top that want to go on the
bottom
here's your vice-versa so you get the
point more fitting now here is the
tubing so this is a PE TG tubing I
believe and I think it is it might be
I'm pretty sure that it's UV reactant if
it's not another big deal we'll just put
some UV fluid in it
but I think I'm going to go for a blue
UV look this is another let's say that's
a 90 degree sitting there wow that is so
heavy just one sitting there expenses
but you get what you pay for
now this here is a rubber insert this is
what you insert into the tube to keep it
from bending that's good to have more PE
TG more PU TG more few TG more PPG more
PEP ya over-prepared definitely more PEP
G yep you guys can judge me all you want
I bought more than I think I'm ever
going to need because I think it's going
to take me a while to get these bends
right woo all right so this is the
bridge between both graphics cards you
guys told me to run this in
parallel so that's why it's here and it
also lights up to lights of blue kind of
bluish UV here's an LED ring that we can
place around our reservoir which is
pretty cool so that will light up the
fluid inside the reservoir itself let's
see oh here's the pump okay so that the
pump is boxed separately but this is
compatible with the reservoir which is
somewhere over there so this just snaps
onto the bottom of it and there we go
and at the CPU block this is very cool
they said they were going to send me the
new or the newer one so I'm assuming
this is the newer one that looks pretty
dope if I do say so myself okay but what
I am not seeing are the graphics card
water blocks so I think we'll have to
wait on those yeah I don't see them in
this box maybe they just forgot them
I'll send them an email you get those
out here
okay and I already ran into my first
problem so you have the bottom 360 mo
right here I have this as an intake I
took your advice so air will be pulled
in from the bottom and then it will move
this way and then be pushed out the top
which is nice because that's how heat
naturally behaves anyway but the issue I
have involves the size of this reservoir
and pump combo with respect to the rest
of the case so there's plenty of space
over on this side other words let me
come about here so I have all of this
room to make use of with the reservoir
but the problem is I ordered this
bracket this bracket was supposed to be
like the support beam but you can see
there are two problems with this the
first problem is that this is actually
configured for both 140 ml and 120 ml
our radiator which means that this looks
retarded look at there's a little dorky
thing sticking out of the ends of the
radiator so that's not cool I don't have
any tools to cut this kind of metal not
on hand anyway maybe in the shop in the
engineering department I don't know
anybody over there which let me do this
for the heck of it and also up talk you
can see we have virtually no space to
funnel our fluid into into the reservoir
oh maybe there's some bracket that I can
buy that that will work for 120 only
that I can just fit right on top of this
and that won't be raised by with 3/4 of
an inch or so that's just good I don't
understand why they did that
okay so nevermind scratch that I
actually combined two separate mounting
kits as you can see here just a few
screws and a few nuts to hold those in
place and then this bracket here is
compatible with 120 and 140 millimeter
mounts so the inner circles and it was
not focusing to the inner circles are
the ones we'll be using to mount this
reservoir atop of the radiator right
there so it actually works out and we're
not going to have a really large just
incline for absolutely no reason
whatsoever but I'm going to go ahead and
mount that second bracket and I'll flip
this thing around and mount it to the
radiator we'll be good to go okay and
there we go as you can see I had to
provides here the brackets were still a
bit too wide for the the length of the
reservoir base so I had to throw a few
washers in I think four washers on each
side so if it's the only thing that
looks a little weird I mean from far
away it looks like that's kind of how
it's supposed to be but obviously this
was just something that I came up with
on a whim and I think that it will do
okay the reservoir I mean it's sturdy
it's not going anywhere and it's
fastened securely to the radiator I
think we're good to go
you see these cables here are for
powering the pump on the bottom there
these will of course be run through the
back panel and the only other thing that
I think I might do is just get my first
it's not going to be a bend but just my
first tube what I'm going to do is run
both these radiators together so I'm
going to have probably I don't know
which direction the flow is going to go
yet I think I want to start with a kind
of come from here and then it's going to
go through the graphics cards picture
graphics cards here and it's going to go
straight up to the CPU it's okay to run
that loop in that way it's okay to have
the fluid running straight from the
graphics cards the CPU not a problem
and then from the CPU and I'm going to
try to run it like that I want to get it
out of the way the RAM that way to it
that's what it looks like over there so
I'm gonna try to run the tubing over the
ramp so that I can remove dims if I need
to at any point and then that tubing is
going to pop up in here I think oh well
if it does that then I guess I have to
run the front tubing down here through
this one Oh in which case I need to
start from here to the ground I don't
know know how it's going to work so this
will probably this isn't in nuts the out
so this is where the fluid will be
pushed out from the pump so maybe from
here that's what we'll do so from here
to the graphics cards up through and
then I guess hmm you know it would look
dope because we're going to have the
case like this is the side panel here so
the case will be sitting like that like
the s3 for you it is so we'll see the
front
right here so what I might do instead of
just doing a straight pipe down which I
wouldn't be able to do anyway unless I
routed the pipe from the CPU up to this
first hole here on the radiator I might
just do like a kind of like a zigzag
sort of methods exact but it's going to
come down now you can't tell and it's
going to cross over but it's going to do
it you know slanted nothing it's not
going to be an abrupt 90 degree so I
think that'll look kind of cool you'll
be able to see that through the front
here so that's just kind of what I have
going on in my head right now
the next part of course will be
motherboard and graphics card
installation and then we'll do the
tubing last but I think I will tackle
just one tube just to get used to the
bent I think that'll be it fairly easy
Bend to do just that maybe a 45 or so
and then a 45 back to get it from up
here to down here sorry about the weird
filming and this first person that's
pretty cheesy but it's very difficult to
film you know solid b-roll for custom
loop stuff absolutely I sit now I don't
see how the big guys do it I really
don't need some tips from them but
that's it
part one is over this is just you know
just kind of wetting my feet at this
point next up will install all the
components make sure the computer is
still running fine and then we'll tackle
the bends in part three so that's it
