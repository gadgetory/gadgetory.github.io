short sweet and to the point you saw the
four pictures and the thumbnail I'll be
reviewing be be quiet da rock pro 3 the
Cryer rig are one Universal the Noctua
NHD 15 and the deep cool assassin to I
want to say up front that all of these
coolers are excellent I don't have an
issue with any of them I do think though
that each brings a certain competitive
advantage to the table and we'll discuss
those in this video to start off first
though I'm going to throw some b-roll at
you accompanied by some super tasteful
music in my opinion to get idea of what
each of these coolers looks like because
let's be real looks are a big priority
you
now that that's out of the way get your
scorecards already I want you to break
this down into four separate categories
looks cooling potential sound and price
those are the four things I think that
you should consider if you're looking to
buy a beefy CPU air cooler now you just
saw the b-roll give one point to the
cool you think looks the ugliest and
give four points to the cooler you think
looks the best
I'll keep mine on screen here so you can
see kind of where I stand now let's move
on to cooling potential these are some
of the best CPU coolers in their class
so I expect that all these should be
within and on a 4 or 5 degrees of each
other and sure enough that was the case
the nokju NHD 15 came out on top with a
load temperature of 76 degrees while
running I 264 for exactly 30 minutes and
then I 760 700 K overclocked a 4.6
gigahertz and 1.3 2 volts idle
temperatures really don't matter those
are usually not that accurate anyway and
then second was the cryo rig r1 this is
a brute cooler here 78 degrees Celsius
followed by the be quiet dark rock pro 3
at 79 and the d cool assassin 2 at 80
degrees so I mean these are all
excellent temperatures the Knox way was
the best cooler but really you'd be ok
with any of these in an overclock system
so this test was objective point should
be dispersed accordingly for points to
knock to it 3 points to cryo rig two
points to be quiet and one point to deep
cool next you're going to hear 8 sound
Clips divided into two categories the
first category is each cooler at idle
that's the lowest possible fan setting
for each cooler and then you'll hear the
last four of each cooler under load I
maxed out all the fan curves in this
case so the fans are running at 100%
worst case scenario without a doubt but
it'll still give you a good idea of
which system should be quietest and
which system should be the loudest
you
you
so based on what I just heard I'm going
to give four points to Noctua
three points to be quiet two points to
deep cool and one point to cry or adjust
assort those points based on what you
think was the loudest give that the
lowest score and then get the highest
score to the cooler you thought was
quietest but is of course the goal here
and a lastly price this will of course
vary based on when you're watching this
video and where you live I live in the
u.s. this is early 2017 so the lowest
price that I found for the naqshi cooler
was 86 dollars and then 85 for the be
quite dark Rock pro 3 followed by 80
bucks for the Keurig our one and only
$70 for the deep cool assassin 2 clearly
deep cool has the advantage in the price
department it's not the best cooler of
the 4 in terms of its cooling potential
how loud it is but you're also saving 10
to 15 bucks depending on the cooler
you're choosing to forego now out of all
the points in each cooler category and
there you go
should pretty much be black and white
unless you have a two or three way tie
in which case I suggest just going with
your gut the one you think looks the
best I would say that's probably the
thing I don't know you the most maybe it
may be the sound I don't know it's up to
you
here are my personal score totals if you
are interested the doctor would come out
on top but I will say that it's fans
look look a bit tacky and tan doesn't
really match much of anything in any
system I've ever built so that might be
a deal breaker for you I will say those
fans are super super quiet even quire's
them to be quiet fans which surprised me
but the be quiet cooler is a cooler that
I would say has the best of everything
in a sense of it doesn't compromise too
much on any quality so it's not the
quietest it's not the best cooler but
it's very close in all the categories I
think it looks the best and it's not too
expensive either so definitely one you
should consider the cryo regard one is a
bruit cooler it's just a beefy air
cooler is what it is and sometimes you
can find it for around 60 bucks so keep
looking if you find one for that price
it will blow any of these out of the
water in terms of a price to performance
standpoint now the deep cool assassin 2
is an interesting one because while it
isn't the best in any of these
categories except for price it is
considerably cheaper than the others so
if price is a huge concern without a
doubt I say go for the assassin - I've
left the conclusion
open-ended because each of these coolers
does have something that it's the best
set without a doubt you can find all
four of them in the video description my
affiliate links are attached to each of
those so if you buy one gives me a small
kickback if you could I'd say that I
don't want to seem like I'm just loudly
slipping in the Amazon affiliate codes
into some of my links even though I do
that for most things because it's kind
of how I make money I don't make any
secret of that it's just what I do and
if I want to do this full-time I'll
definitely have to continue that because
Amazon revenue is actually a big part of
my income every month if you like this
video be sure to give it a thumbs up and
give it a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite click the subscribe
button if you haven't already I don't
know why my my accent is changing that
was kind of weird this is sounds our
studio thanks for running with</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
