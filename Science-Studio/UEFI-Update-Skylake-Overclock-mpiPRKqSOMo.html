do so a few weeks ago I uploaded a video
detailing how to overclock a non k until
sky like CPU the method we used involved
as rocks new beta bios while it was new
at the time anyway and while I knew what
I was doing for the most part there were
things that I wasn't sure about because
I didn't have the time to do the
research before him what I wanted to do
was get this video out on youtube as
quick as possible because I didn't see
anybody else with a tutorial yet a guide
of how to install the bios to this
overclock a non k intel sky like CPU so
i didn't really have that assurance to
back up what i was doing and that's why
i was uncertain with a lot of the stuff
that was going on in the video at the
time no other video on youtube had
detailed the process so i jumped as
quickly as I could on to the opportunity
at the expense of not necessarily
knowing exactly what I was doing at
every point in the video and that was
pointed out by many of you viewers and I
appreciate that even though it was a
very very constructive in some cases I
do want to make another video this video
here to show you with assurance how easy
it is to update a BIOS so first thing
you want to do open your favorite
browser go to your specific motherboards
website now at this point I do know that
as rock is on board so we will be
detailing the method using as rocks new
bios update now the bios that they have
is not in beta anymore it is actually an
official release so that's pretty cool
i'll be able to override my old beta
bios with the official one even though
I'm sure nothing will be different so on
this list here under the intel socket
1150 one which is obviously what is used
for until skylake cpus you want to find
your specific board RS is the Z 170 pro
for okay verify that you know this
actually is your motherboard they'll
show pictures usually this is in fact
the motherboard that I have in the
system right there navigate over to the
Downloads tab and then you're going to
see BIOS download underneath all the
drivers and utilities you should already
have all the drivers and utilities
installed so don't worry about any of
those unless you think you're missing
something click on bios download and you
are going to see all of the compare
BIOS updates that you could choose to
install onto your motherboard the most
recent is the 3.0 version you can see
the description behind this one is that
it supports the sky sky lake overclock
so the size of this file 7.47 megabytes
and we can use instant flash to install
the bios we're going to download from
USA because that is where we live just
save it anywhere you want I'm just going
to save it to my desktop so you can see
over here it's downloading and it has
finished downloading so now that it is
there plug in a thumb drive I have like
almost no space on the Sun drive and
drag this file over to the root of your
thumb drive don't put it in any folder
or anything like that now what I like to
do just in case is extract the wrong as
well so go ahead and extract it if you
want it doesn't have to be extracted but
I do this just in case because some UEFI
I should say not biases but UEF eyes do
not like the fact that some instant
flashes are zipped so once the official
folder and one is the official zip
folder that's really all we need now
we're going to turn off the computer you
could also just restart but you know
it's whatever and once the computer has
turned off my oh my it is a very dark in
here go ahead and turn it back on and
press f2 until you hop into your bios
there we are so this is what the beta
bios look like this was the 2.83 beta
release which allowed me to overclock
initially so you can see here that my
processor speed on my little I 360 100
is 4.1 ish gigahertz and that obviously
would not be the case without the beta
BIOS but now what we're going to do is
hop on over to Advanced Mode so this is
going to load the older looking BIOS
you're going to want to go into tool and
then you can see right here instant
flash so instant flash has scanned
everything that is plugged into the
computer whether it be a hard drive
solid-state drive or removable thumb
drive and it's going to find all the
compatible romsey you could update your
motherboard with so you can see here
this is the 2.83 beta bios update this
one right here is the 2.8 UEFI update
which I had in case the 2.83 beta bios
update failed and this one right here is
our three point Oh official non-beta sky
overclocked UEFI so once you have found
that one it's going to ask you if you
want to update the UEFI 23 point oh go
ahead and click yes it's going to tell
you to not power off during the UF I
update obviously because if you power
off you're pretty much going to sabotage
your UEFI and someone pointed out that
there is just a simple little you with a
chip that you could replace to fix your
motherboard but that really sounds like
a painful process I know it's something
you could just push in and pull out from
your board but jeez all that for just a
bad uaf i flash and
so it's going to tell you that the
programming was successful hopefully it
tells you that and then it's going to
say press entered reboots we're going to
hit okay and it's going to shut off the
system so the system is completely shut
off it should reboot and more than
likely pushes back into the bios but
just in case we're going to hit f2 over
and over again until we're thrown into
it okay so we hit f2 and we are thrown
directly into our BIOS once again but
this time in the non beta version so
this is the official you can see p 3
point 0 version of the bios from here if
you wanted you could hop into advanced
mode and it's going to say yes which to
advanced mode then you can go into
overclocked weaker click on cpu
configuration and from here you can
change your block frequency once you
change your block frequency to whatever
desired value you choose it'll be x 37
which is also called the multiplier and
110 x 37 in this case gives you a grand
total of forty seventy so 4070 megahertz
which is just over 4 gigahertz and
that's our target cpu speed so once
you've selected this value i also advise
changing this change this to 1 gigahertz
it's just good to do now this increases
the frequency of the speed at which your
cpu communicates with your pcie lanes
once you've done that go ahead and pop
on over to exit save changes and exit
then you can save your configuration
computers obviously going to shut off
again because that's to establish those
new settings that you just performed and
i'm going to go and hop into the bios
again just to verify that we are in fact
overclocking or cpu hitting f2 again I
get thrown into our three point 0 bios
excuse me uaf i keep saying bios but
it's UEFI and you can see that a
processor speed is not targeted and
currently running edge
stover 4 gigahertz now take know this
will also alter your ram speed so if
you're running around that's faster than
2133 let's say you got 2666 megahertz
like i do and it's just XMP profile to
2133 changing the base clock will also
change your ram frequency so it doesn't
only affect your CPU so in this case you
can see that raising the base clock from
100 to 110 raise my ddr4 frequency from
2133 to 2346 so yeah there's that there
are benefits to having faster ddr4 if
you are not familiar with those benefits
you can click the video here how long
can you see my finger but click that
video right there and you can kind of
see a GTA 5 comparison so howdy-do are
for speed effects particular games but
that is about it for this video so I'm
going to do is just exit actually one
more thing yeah that's on standard let's
do performance I want to increase my
overall fan speed just because I am
overclocking and my cpu is running a tad
bit hot so right 54c right now it's not
really on idle but it kind of is so that
is a bit harder than normal so once
you've configured everything that you
wish to configure you can go ahead and
hop up here to the Save icon and it will
ask if you want to save your
configuration changes click yes and your
computer will reboot
okay an operating system wasn't found
try disconnecting any drives that don't
contain an operating system okay so it
looks like our boot devices are
completely empty that might be the
problem we'll just call it solid-state
drive ok second boot device we'll just
yeah ok so what probably happened was
the bios just completely wiped out its
boot device priority and for some reason
still asking you what I want to do but
obviously I want to boot for my solid
state drive so now that we are actually
in our operating system as we should
have been to begin with I will hop into
hardware monitor just for a second now
we aren't going to see actual CPU
temperatures on here because whenever
you overclock using the base clog method
you kind of sacrifice those abilities
for a few reasons actually but you can't
see that both of our cores are operating
at 4.1 ish gigahertz which is the value
that we set it at in the UEFI so we can
confirm that our overclock did stick and
this only further solidifies the fact
that you can't overclock a non k Intel
skylake CPU so yeah that's pretty cool
oh look a new crimson raid on software
so anyways I appreciate the watch
hopefully this video redeemed the last
video to an extent I know that the older
UEFI update video was not the most
professional so that's why I wanted to
make this one to show you that yes I do
know what I'm doing but also to help
those of you out there who did Wow we
just want to see a simple quick solution
so this is science to do thanks for
learning with this
you
