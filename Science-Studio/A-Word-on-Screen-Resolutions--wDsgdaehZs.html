finished with all my finals I appreciate
your patience you subscribe to the
channel for a reason so I'm gonna try to
deliver as much content as possible
without compromising on the word quality
and you can take that to mean whatever
you'd like but in the context of this I
am going to keep it very simplistic I'm
not gonna do much editing I'm not gonna
do many overlays or pop-ups or any of
that I might throw a few pictures in
just to help explain what I'm trying to
describe but that's pretty much it so
let me know in the comments below if you
like this style this bare-bones style
video we're gonna talk about topics like
the one I'm about to talk about in these
kinds of videos so maybe watch this one
all the way through and then tell me
what you think about it in the comments
below if you don't like it we'll stop it
and move on to something else but if you
do like it I would like to know so that
I know to continue these because that I
think these topics are fairly
interesting and I would like to hear
ideas for future topics as well but the
one I want to talk about here is screen
resolutions that was a very very
confusing topic back in the day you
might be thinking what great come on
like okay 1080p we all know 1080p is
1920 by 1080 right that's a 16 by 9
aspect ratio if you divide 1920 by 1080
it's the equivalent of 16 over 9 okay so
1080p that's that's what that is that's
literally the number of pixels going
from the top to the bottom of the screen
well it gets more confusing that because
that's regarded this full HD right so if
we move on to something like 1440p that
ratio I wrote this now to make sure I
didn't say it wrong
the 1440p pixel dimensions are 2560 by
1440
okay now that ratio still comes out to
sixteen over nine right but you have
more pixels packed into the screen so
your resolutions gonna be higher it's
preferable right you want to have a
higher resolution screen
well that that resolution 1440p is
technically quad HD now you're thinking
okay well quad HD so that means that
it's four times the resolution of HD so
isn't that 4k well no it's not and
that's why I was confused for a long
time because I would see even phones
come out with quad HD screens and I
would think wow they're packing 4k
resolutions into really really small
screens that's crazy and I know they are
actually now like the the Sony Xperia z5
I think is a 4k HD scree
a few others but but a few years ago
that was like unheard of why is it
called quad-hd if it's not actually four
times resolution of HD well that's just
it it actually is and it goes back to
the roots of HD the definition of HD
when it comes to screen resolutions is
720p so we're saying 1280 by 720 is
actually the definition of high
definition
so 1080p is actually an improvement on
regular HD and that's why we call 1080p
full-hd so when you see f HD sometimes
it's called or it'll just say full high
definition
that's 1080p but now sometimes you'll
see a screen that'll say high definition
that could be 720p so you want to check
the dimensions to make sure that the
screen you're looking at has the
dimensions that the pixel dimensions
that you're expecting it to have you
don't to be undersold and get a 720p
screen when you thought you were getting
a 1080p screen that would kind of suck
so keep that in mind always double check
the screen resolution in actual numbers
don't just take it for at its face value
its HD because it could just be 720p and
that would not be false advertising
because 720p is is HD not fully 2d but
it is HD so 1080p is Full HD and then
above that is 1440p and that's quad HD
so it's called quad HD because it's four
times the resolution of 720p so if you
take for 720p screens and stack them one
next to each other and then two on top
of those screens
that's quad HD that is the 2560 by 1440
resolution so that makes sense now
right so it's called quad HD because
it's based on 720p which is the actual
definition of HD so four times the
resolution of 720p is quad HD and then
lastly we move on to 4k 4k is four times
the resolution of 1080p so four times
the full HD resolution is 4k which is 38
3840 by 2160 so if you take 2 to 1080p
screens and stack them next to each
other and then take two more and stack
them atop those two that's 4k so you see
4k is actually much much higher in
resolution than 1440p is
even though 1440p is still defined as
quad-hd so what I want you to take away
from this I know it's not a long video
but I wanted to make the distinction
between these four different types and
why they're called what they're called
when you're looking for screens and
looking at on a phones or anything else
that has a screen resolution double
check the actual the actual dimensions
of the screen in terms of pixels just
because it says HD that doesn't mean
that it's going to be 1080p just because
it says that it's four times the
resolution of HD that doesn't mean it's
going to be 4k in fact in most cases I
don't mean quad HD which is actually
lower resolution than 4k it's it's
significantly lower if you ask some
people so keep those things in mind I
just wanted to kind of let you guys know
about this I'm sure a lot of you already
knew but those are the different
classifications of HD so you start with
HD 720p Full HD at 1080p quad HD 1440p
and 4k at four times the resolution of
1080p so with that if there's anything
you'd like to add the topic at hand be
sure to do so by leaving a comment in
the comment section below if you have
ideas for future topics be sure to leave
those in the comments as well I read all
of them I honestly do I don't know if
you guys believe me but I read every
single comment that comes through the
channel and comes through every video
they all come to my mailing app on my
iPhone so whenever I get a notification
I open it up I have four right now so
I'll be reading those after the filming
of this video is finished but thank you
for the contributions and thank you for
the devotion to the channel and the
engaging conversations even if they're
not the most civil you're learning
something right now learning some social
skills at least so with all of that said
we're about hit 10,000 subscribers
10,000 heck by the time you're watching
this video could be 30 minutes after
it's been uploaded or two years in the
future heck we hit 10,000 subscribers at
around the time this video is uploaded
and that's freaking crazy and that's all
thanks to all of you who are subscribed
thank you even for those of you who are
just watching consider subscribing
because we we do post some pretty
interesting videos I don't I don't build
computers that are very expensive I
build computers that most of us can
afford at least to some degree I'm not a
big you know over spender when it comes
to computer parts and in graphics cards
and water cooling units and all that
it's it's just kind of it's just what I
can afford at the time and that's
ultimately what I end up building and
I'm glad that most of you have been
letting me know that you appreciate that
because that's what I think I'll
continue to do because you can go to any
other computer building channel on
YouTube and watch two thousand dollar
pcs being built and that's you know
that's great and all but how many people
can actually afford that or willing to
afford that's you know some of these
things get a little ostentatious so I
stay around 600 to 1200 dollars that's
about the most I've ever spent on a
computer and that's where I think that
the target computer price will be for
this channel for the foreseeable future
unless you guys tell me otherwise so
thank you for all of your contributions
be sure to like this particular video if
you like this style in this format if
you don't like it and you don't want to
see any other videos like this on the
channel ever again give it a thumbs down
I do take all of those to heart be sure
to subscribe if you haven't already as a
just just do it I guess and stay tuned
for for more content especially coming
up these next few months
this is science studio thanks for
learning with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
