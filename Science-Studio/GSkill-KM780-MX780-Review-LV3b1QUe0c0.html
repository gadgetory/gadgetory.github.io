mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX brown
switches and the g.skill ripjaws MX 780
RGB laser gaming mouse they may have
long titles but they're beautiful
compliments to any gaming PC hands-down
I'll discuss both in this video because
they're a part of the same relatively
new product line from g.skill which as
I'm sure you're aware has been a leading
manufacturer in memory modules since the
early 2000s anyone who's ever wanted to
build a PC is likely heard of g.skill
but that's probably not the case when it
comes to peripherals let's see if their
reputation precedes them
so let's start with the keyboard first
of course it's mechanical sporting
genuine Cherry MX brown switches
although you can choose between red
brown or blue for this model more on
that later it's a relatively bulky
keyboard liberal in both it's a design
and posture measuring just under 52
centimeters in length thanks to its
protruding what is this a support beam
at first I thought it was pointless but
in fact it serves as a modular interface
between the included palm rest which you
can remove and the extra key carrying
case not sure why you'd want that
connected but it's there if you want it
the palm rest on the other hand is very
welcome it provides excellent wrist
support a sharp contrast from the other
mechanical keyboard I reviewed earlier
you get what you pay for build quality
all-around excellent even the cable is
finely and rigidly braided the same can
be said for the mouse the keypad is
covered with a brushed metal the keys
themselves are ergonomically contoured
and the fact that g-scale opted for
cherries here is a pleasant surprise
they asked me which key type I'd like to
test out and being that my other
keyboard already sports blue switches
albeit not cherries I decided to go for
brown this time many of you told me that
Brown would be a viable replacement for
loud clunky blue switches and while I am
familiar with how they all feel and
respond I do still prefer blue switches
for gaming and typing in general but I
of course can't fault g.skill here since
they offer both MX blue and MX red
variants for the exact same price as the
brown variant here I am glad they give
consumers this kind of flexibility
especially without a financial penalty
but speaking of options there are two
LED variants of this keyboard the km 780
RGB and the km 780 MX the only
difference is the fact that obviously
the RGB model offers RGB switches with
plenty of programmable functions
including individual key customization
the MX model only offers red LED
backlighting but you're still able to
program individual keys and tinker with
unique effects one thing I do have to
harp on g.skill for I know you saw this
coming g.skill the fact that you're
charging a 40 dollar premium solely for
RGB support I'm not even kidding
everything else is exactly the same on
paper who are literally paying 40 bucks
for the addition of RGB lighting some
may still find it worth the bump in
price but I imagine many will see fault
with it now apart from the typical keys
you'll see on a qwerty mechanical
keyboard you'll find a series of
programmable keys to the far left a
macro key and three mode
for controlling lighting effects
peripheral and brightness keys media
keys and a volume dial with an active
LED display I'm especially thankful for
dedicated media keys I think that
addition is a great one and the
interactive volume dial is a nice touch
as well much better than holding down
the function key and repetitively
pressing f3 to turn up the volume
something I had to do with the other
keyboard on the back of the km 784 just
a moment you'll find headphone and
microphone ports a single USB 2.0 port I
ended up plugging the mouse into this
one and a rollover switch these ports
will be especially useful for those with
short cabled peripherals now on to the
MX 780 spec wise its sporting a laser
sensor with up to 8200 dpi and 4 zone
RGB backlighting it only weighs 120
grams fits the hand seamlessly and
glides over practically any surface with
ease thanks to its PTFE colide pads
while I'm normally turned off by
prominent company logos the g.skill logo
located front and center it's not trying
to hide itself actually looks sweet in
my opinion at least thanks to the RGB
back lighting the mouse as a whole looks
a bit like a transformer space see the
eyes there so you know I'm talking about
but it isn't something I'm willing to be
picky about some will like it and others
simply will not there are also LEDs
towards the top of the mouse which can
be seen through either side as well as
the scrolling wheel g.skill also
includes interchangeable thumb rest good
for both left and right-handed users in
terms of usability the MX 780 will take
some getting used to if this is going to
be your first and gaming mouse ever it's
super sensitive super touchy is Nick 11
would say and reactions even the
smallest movements thanks to its
high-quality laser sensor this is
typical of most gaming mice and no
adjusting mouse sensitivity within your
OS won't entirely fix this behavior
gamers love this feeling it's a bit like
owning a high refresh rate monitor not
the same but you get my point but I will
say that anyone coming from a twenty
dollar mouse will definitely notice the
difference now I save this software for
last because it's a bit of a mess
currently and in my personal opinion
requires a complete redesign from the
ground up I'm not joking firstly both
the keyboard and mouse as far as I'm
aware require two separate programs for
operation I have no idea who the heck
came up with this idea in the first
place many companies still do this but I
find it unnecessary to have two separate
programs on my desktop for complimentary
peripherals
so that just doesn't make sense there
should be a button somewhere up top to
switch between the two something for
example NZXT does with their cam
software and on top of that
inconvenience the menus and tabs are a
bit cluttered and incoherent I'm
typically not this hardcore critical
about software because unlike hardware
it can be changed and republished after
the fact but in this case it needs to be
completely redone
I have engineering textbooks that are
easier to understand and the software is
in contrast to Corsairs utility engine
the rift Java configurator will require
a manual for proper operation I'll give
them this though at least their manual
pulls through it's easy to follow just
very dense but even with the confusing
software taken into consideration this
is still one heck of a keyboard and this
is still one heck of a gaming mouse so
what if you don't play video games it'll
be a joy to type of documents with
thanks to the integrated Cherry MX
mechanical switches and the palm rest
price-wise you're looking at around one
hundred and seventy US dollars on the
pricey side but in direct competition
with the identically priced k70 RGB from
corsair and if you're willing to
compromise on RGB you can bring the
price of this one down to one hundred
and thirty bucks in my opinion a much
more reasonable price you can find links
to both the km 780 in the MX 780 in this
video's description along with the
keyboards Cherry MX red and MX blue
counterparts if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you do feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything about
life be sure to click to subscribe but
if you have already stay tuned for I
think next I'm gonna review the a.k
racing chair that I'm currently sitting
in a very comfortable chair it's a
beautiful chair it matches pretty much
everything else in the studio so I think
I'm gonna do that next
this is science studio thanks for
