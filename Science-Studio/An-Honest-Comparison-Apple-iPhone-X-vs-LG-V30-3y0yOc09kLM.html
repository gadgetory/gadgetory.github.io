Android and Apple phones on the one hand
I love the reliability and speed of iOS
iMessage is also another great perk I
can even message on airplanes as is the
wide selection of apps in the Apple App
Store but the iPhone tends price I just
can't get on board with too many issues
out of the gate too many unoptimized
apps and no headphone jack yeah I'm
gonna bring it up
so Apple fans this is your time to jump
ship reinvest your $1,000 into the LGB
30 plus I don't know like 40 large
pizzas but wait a minute
the LGP 30 costs $800 that's still high
monthly payments on these phones are
about 1/4 of what you'd pay for a car
lease plenty of v13 iPhone 10 reviews
have already hit YouTube so in this
video I figured I throw in a bit of a
comparison and bring sound judgment to
the core of the Apple fanbase I get it
core is like core of the Apple nevermind
so the LGB 30 is one sexy phone you
Apple lovers can't deny and I'll give
the iPhone 10 credit where it's due
looks pretty sweet as well I will say
however that the way in which the screen
wraps around the iPhones top bezel is a
turn-off at least for me I'd much rather
take the V 30s approach super slim
bezels on both the top and bottom of the
phone give it a Samsung Galaxy s8 esque
appeal it also centers the screen on the
phone's chassis just seems a bit more
balanced from a raw performance
perspective the iPhone 10 undoubtedly
takes the cake Apple's a 11 Bionic chip
powers it's 6 cores to a single score of
4200 on Geekbench for about 10,000 on
the multi-core side this is higher than
some desktop processors this performance
mind you is mirrored on the iPhone 8 the
LG v 30 though lags behind despite
boasting an extra 2 cores at Snapdragon
835 yields around 1,900 on a single side
6200 on the multi that combined with
only 4 gigs of RAM makes the V 30 only
satisfactory in its current state I'd
like to have seen 6 gigs of RAM for
future proof 'no sand you know trading
multitasking and the balancing of the
operating system and its overhead with
what you're gonna be doing on the phone
for seems like a just I don't know it's
an ok number the iPhone 10 only
for its three gigs of RAM but this is
perfectly fine when seen in the context
of its lightweight UI these are facts I
can't argue with them but the v30 has
plenty on board for comeback starting
first with the screen sporting a 6 inch
qHD plus 28 80 by 1440 resolution
ol√° display you'll be hard-pressed to
find and discern individual pixels and
that crazy contrast ratio yields some of
the truest blacks all round you could
say the same about the iPhones 24 36 by
11 25 unconventional pixel display still
all it and still sporting rounded
corners but overall PPI is around 15%
lower not that you'll notice both
screens are calibrated well enough
although I leaned a bit more toward LG's
more natural looking screen apples
oversaturated things just a bit here of
course these presets can be adjusted
it's just something I've noted when I
first compare them side-by-side now
let's talk cameras I'll tell you that
neither is really a clear winner
although I do prefer one over the other
both sport dual cameras with different
functions the V 30s primary sports the
better aperture and higher pixel count
but this doesn't always translate well
on paper the iPhones primary has a wider
field of view which i think is great and
you'll have excellent optical zoom with
that telephoto lens overall I noticed
more contrast in the iPhone which I have
no problem with colors are a bit deeper
and low-light performance is still
excellent the v30 falls slightly behind
despite its wider aperture which is a
bit weird
yet it both slightly better color
reproduction in my book where the LG
truly shines though is with its
secondary wide-angle lens
field of view is amped up to the extreme
here which I love I'd honestly be ok
with this as the primary camera and a
telephoto or something along those lines
as a secondary overall I'd say the
iPhone 10 takes the better photo
but I'd swap an overdone portrait mode
for a secondary wide-angle any day of
the week as for video essentially the
same story the iPhone shoots it up to 4k
60fps which is pretty insane for a phone
the V 30 topping out at 4k 30 you can
film in the same resolution with the
wide angle lens though which gives it an
edge I'd also favor the V 30s optical
image stabilization or video
stabilization over the iPhone tends
along with its superior recording volume
and clarity slow-motion capabilities
definitely tip
in favor of the iPhone the V 30s 720p
120 mode looks absolutely terrible with
the iPhone you can keep the resolution
in 1080p and record it twice the
framerate night and day difference here
alright testing the front-facing cameras
on both the V 30 and the iPhone 10 I
just noticed that the LG's crops me
quite a bit more than the iPhone says
this camera in general has much more
natural color reproduction it seems like
the LG's is a bit washed out the
front-facing camera is no doubt worse on
the V 30 both front-facing cameras are
decent but the iPhones is better just
point-blank higher resolution higher
framerate although I'm not sure why
you'd need 720p 240 FPS support in the
front camera I'm not even sure if that's
like legit on the spec sheet and better
low-light performance
LG's video stabilization at the front is
better it's important I suppose for
vloggers so it ultimately comes down to
the preferences of the user in other
areas of the spec sheet you'll find that
these two phone's constantly trade blows
the iPhone is a slightly thicker yet
smaller in other dimensions which I
actually prefer the iPhone doesn't
support a headphone jack which is just
stupid the V 30s is up top and in the
perfect place really no complaints here
apart from the fact that you don't get
headphones out of the box it's something
that really makes no sense to me
I'd prefer headphones but because they
don't have headphones included I'm not
really gonna give this a win to the V 30
sound quality tips in favor of the
iPhone 10 with the earpiece acting as a
second albeit slightly trebly speaker
you'll essentially have a stereo right
here I'm also loving the lows from the
bottom speaker with the V 30 you get
neither of these things only one speaker
down at the face and it's pretty trashy
by comparison it still gets quite loud
though others subtle observations the
LG's fingerprint scanner is noticeably
faster than Apple's face ID response
time despite how much they boasted it in
the keynote both phones support fast
charging but the LG's larger 3300
milliamp hour battery wins the endurance
battle easily lasting a full 16 hour day
under heavy use that's my version of
heavy use which is really high it also
boasts stereo quad parallel delta-sigma
converter channels with a 32 bit
interpolation filter for a low noise
conversion process as Android
authority puts it it's basically a
better substitute for snapdragons SOC
solution a high-quality 32-bit DAC
intended to make wired audio playback
sound as crispy as a taco shell let me
tell you it does sound really good at
which you could hear it in person
there's really quite a lot packed into
both of these phones but it seems as
though Apple's targeting the screen real
estate as the tens biggest selling point
whereas LG took a little bit of
everything in their approach with some
of the smaller features packed inside
when it comes down to it both of these
devices are excellent maybe not for the
price but that's just my opinion I mean
come on 800 bucks for this like phones
four years ago were less than half this
price brand-new those concern with
budgets are probably better off with 1
plus or Huawei models these are the
biggest and best in their classes as for
which I would personally pick it's got
to be the LGB 30 if you liked this video
be sure to give it a thumbs up
