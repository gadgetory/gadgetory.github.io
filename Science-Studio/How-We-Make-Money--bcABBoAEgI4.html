started pushing for contracts
experimenting a bit out of the box and
running component giveaways I've learned
a lot about what it takes to run a
channel and full-on business and the
space most of us in the tech media
industry just kind of jump straight into
it and adapted to consumer preferences
as they changed we work for you we also
inadvertently work as contractors for
YouTube so that's interesting we've also
had to adapt to YouTube's ever-changing
and holier-than-thou algorithm something
I still can't quite comprehend but these
are the risks we all take in this space
and we do it willfully because we get to
be our own bosses we risk losing
everything if YouTube decides to turn a
blind eye to something as absurd as a
sham copyright strike or two likewise a
viewer stop watching altogether for
whatever reason we're finished we've
fully invested in this platform now I
say all of that to say this your trust
in me as a reviewer is vital if I lose
my integrity I lose you and then I lose
my business so without getting into
exact dollar amounts I'm gonna break
down science videos finances for you
maybe satisfy your more curiosity maybe
really one of the how things work around
here I want you to see where our money
comes from where it goes and how we
handle contracts ads and big events I
think you'll enjoy this one
whether you're looking for a mid tower
with plenty of room for a stack of hard
drives or a silent profile even under
load the be quiet dark bass 700 has you
covered and act fast only 3000 units of
the white Edition you're seeing here are
being made click the link below for more
details so let's get the ball rolling
with a pie chart I made I feel very very
proud of this chart what you're looking
at is science studios 2018 revenue by
percent so take this green pie slice for
example it represents promotions so
sponsored video and pre-roll income
generated externally meaning it doesn't
come from YouTube or any major retailer
directly instead it comes from the
companies we either one work very
closely with in the industry like a sous
and deep cool and be quiet or to share a
similar target audience with other
products and services they offer aren't
tied directly to the computer tech
industry an example of this would be
like expressvpn we've run a few ads for
them in the past and while VPNs
themselves aren't exactly tangible bits
of hardware we can review in videos many
of our viewers share common interests
with their target audience so they
choose to advertise with us another part
of this slice is event revenue which is
an indirect way of labeling the revenue
we generate to fund the big trips would
take each year to places like copy tech
CES PACs and others consider copy text
which is coming up actually in a few
months time is flying by with this event
we sell packages to companies that
include event pre-rolls
discounted promotional content in the
future especially if bundled and
guaranteed coverage at the event in
question everyone tends to handle this
financing a bit differently I know some
people just sell pre-rolls like general
pre-rolls to cover this stuff but we
just we don't generate enough revenue
from pre rules to get us to these events
and a Computex
event costs thousands of dollars to
attend especially if you plan to bring
others with you to edit in film it's
plane tickets are like two grand in and
of themselves from my city so we do
things this way to build the
relationships with companies long term
and at the same time produce as much
content as possible and by the way we
also visit the Busan Suites of companies
at these events who don't pay us at all
to be there so at CES this year for
example we covered Coolermaster and
alpha cool and dedicated videos to
companies that have never paid us a dime
so I just wanted to clear that one up so
a 40% of our total revenue for 2018 came
these external companies in fact it
almost perfectly matched our Google
Adsense income which is the money we
received directly from YouTube
viewership through the use of baked in
ads and banners I bet you didn't know
that Adsense revenue accounted for less
than half of science videos total income
for the year you learned something today
I further dissected YouTube revenue into
ad revenue so that's the pre rolls and
banners I just mentioned YouTube red
which is technically now YouTube's
premium and super chats which of those
donations we receive from viewers during
our live streams so to read this smaller
pie chart correctly 2% of our total
channel revenue for 2018 came from Super
chats and as much as 34% of it came from
ad revenue directly these three
percentages should sum to 40% of the
total pie area which is what this red
slice represents so after YouTube and
promotional revenue is Amazon affiliate
revenue our third largest revenue
generator which accounts for 16% of our
total revenue for the year I don't think
I need to explain how this money is
generated at this point but in a
nutshell if you click on an affiliate
link in one of our videos and buy a
product Amazon gives us a small kickback
typically around 1 to 3 percent of the
total cost of the item it really depends
on the item and its category fun fact it
doesn't even have to be the product
whose link you originally clicked on so
if for example you click on a graphics
card affiliate link in one of our videos
and then navigate to a computer case
instead we'll get the kickback for the
case if you decide to purchase that
essentially Amazon is incentivizing us
as the influencers to draw traffic to
the platform and it's our job to
disclose to our viewers the fact that
the links are affiliated so that they
know what's going on next up on the pie
chart is this 2% blue slice here which
represents new egg sales we use an
affiliate program called Commission
Junction or CJ to pull traffic to this
source Newegg doesn't have a baked in
affiliate program at this point which
kind of sucks but CJ works well enough
we pull a much smaller audience to the
site for a few reasons for one a
majority of our links even on older
videos or Amazon links but just started
doing new wake stuff a couple of years
ago and for two new egg is significantly
more exclusive when seen in the context
of the sheer size of Amazon so our
affiliate links for Amazon work pretty
much anywhere Amazon sells goods like
the UK the US Canada Germany etc Newegg
is much smaller an hour traffic reflects
this nonetheless the revenue is still
noteworthy I mean 2%
I'm super small but it's something and
that's why we use CJ for them otherwise
it's lost revenue lastly our smallest
pie slice is patreon which is just
another way for our viewers to earn a
bit of exclusivity and support us
indirectly we provide perks and our
public discord for them including
private channels and play games like pub
G with quite a bit essentially they get
preference when we do things like this I
do have plans however to terminate
patreon account of YouTube's membership
feature which is that enjoying button
down below next to the subscribe button
it's similar to twitch a subscription
button and this kind of makes patrons
features a bit redundant more on the
YouTube membership feature in this video
right here so that's where our money
comes from and that's how it's divided
but let's take a closer look at some of
these slices consider the YouTube slice
we could do a lot with this one but a
chart I think you'll find very
interesting is the percent revenue
generated by individual videos on the
channel now I don't have a problem
showing this because it doesn't take a
rocket scientist to put two and two
together typically the more views the
video earns the higher the payout I mean
whoop-dee-doo but there are a few
caveats which we will discuss shortly a
few trends you can actually see in this
chart so up top here is the verge PC
video which was actually uploaded toward
the end of 2018 still it accounts for
nearly 8 percent of total Adsense
revenue and it was our most lucrative
video that entire year up next is the I
read a terrible Craigslist PC ad video
that's this one right here for those
wondering 6% of total Adsense revenue
came from it then my review of the
13-inch MacBook Pro another Craigslist
video and so on you can kind of see a
trend here
Craigslist videos tend to do very well
as to do Apple videos and that's a very
persuasive metric for some you might
think wow why isn't Greg doing more of
these and my answer is well if I did I'd
probably face out a huge chunk of my
core audience a lot of you hate Apple
and just you know pop into dislike the
video leave a weird comment and then
leave you can do that it's an open
platform that's fine but it's one of the
reasons why I like to take these videos
and stride and gonna sprinkle them in
every now and then same goes for the
Craigslist videos a lot of you actually
enjoy those but apart from the kind of
street smart knowledge and use price
breakdowns the videos lack true you know
heavy scientific substance so again I
sprinkled them in
every now and then now another important
thing to consider with this chart is CPM
which is effectively the cost per
thousand views advertisers pay to plant
ads in a video some videos have higher
CPM than others it's kind of related to
tags and the you know the the vibrancy
of the channel at the time but typical
range is usually between one and three
dollars that means if a video earns one
million views the content creator
typically earns between one thousand and
three thousand dollars but don't get too
excited only the huge channels pull
millions of views per video right in our
case it verges to between maybe fifty to
a hundred thousand views and that
usually has to accumulate over a month
or so
so most videos in our case don't earn
more than about $100 that doesn't sound
like too much money fun fact number two
Craigslist videos for whatever reason
tend to earn higher CPM s than normal so
we actually make more money on those per
view than the typical video but even if
we assume something is absurd as like a
five-dollar CPM that only translates to
is it half of one penny per view is my
math right there I mean yeah it adds up
but still at least it puts things into
perspective and that's why promotional
content is so vital to larger channels
typically when channels reached like a
half a million or a million subs in this
space they plant an external pre-roll in
nearly every video this again is not
Adsense we're talking about anymore
those are usually in by default external
pre-rolls or those pre-rolls we as
content creators usually put together we
get the green light from the company
sponsoring the content we create the
content sent it in for approval it gets
approved and then we plant that video or
that little clip that add into one of
our videos along with corresponding
links consider this video you saw a
pre-roll early on from be quiet and you
got the links attached in the video
description we offer two different kinds
15-second and 30-second pre-rolls and
nothing longer than that since audience
retention rates tend to drop rather fast
when you approach a minute long pre-roll
we also have two different pricing
structures depending on who is buying a
pre-roll whether it be a single ad or a
discounted bundle remember the two
different types of companies we talked
about in our promotional slice
discussion companies are either within
the industry or outside the industry
obviously those within the industry sell
products pertaining directly to the
computer industry has to do with what we
do on the channel on a daily basis we
you know
showoff graphics cards test things like
motherboards CPUs cases coolers power
supplies gosh LED strips yet the point
if it's something I can review and mix
in with traditional content on this
channel it's within the industry and as
a result I charge these companies less
per ad now you might be thinking but
Greg why would you charge less to
companies that share your target
audience I mean typically if you know
you can provide a decent ROI for the
company in question you charge more
because you can but there's a conflict
of interest not many people talk about
and that's affiliate program so Amazon
and Newegg B&amp;amp;H whoever when we review
products we know in the back of our
heads that our conclusions and critiques
will directly affect our click-through
weights for affiliate programs so if I
give a computer case a terrible review I
probably won't earn much affiliate
revenue through the cases Amazon link
see what I mean so to be clear that does
not affect my ability to objectively
review products I imagine doesn't affect
much many other reviewers out there
either we have enough content on our
channels and a fair balance of good and
bad one more negative review won't
change much at all I'm going to tell it
to you straight up exactly how it is how
I see it
but tech companies know that pre-rolls
planted on channels like mine tend to
have a better engagement since the
hardware is similar to stuff they see
all the time on the channel that means
we get to double dip I make money from
the company for creating and planning
the ad in the first place
and I make money from Amazon a new egg
whose customers purchased products
through those corresponding affiliate
links so to lower the stakes
I charge less for those companies it's
probably not the norm and I'd honestly
be surprised if any other tech youtuber
did things of this way but it's a way
for me to incentivize industry reps and
ensure that we have promotional content
to include in future videos that said if
the product sucks I won't be advertising
on a science studio I'm not gonna happen
if someone buys a garbage product off of
my recommendation and realizes that it's
you know actually garbage my reputation
is ruined in baby steps I mean one
ruined you know opinion of myself isn't
gonna do much but every step counts and
if many people began taking the same
thing they won't watch the channel so I
only promote products that I'm confident
my viewers that's all of you will either
enjoy or at least consider because
thankfully there's more than one good
product from one company
out there and recall this pie chart
promotional content is a huge chunk of
our revenue it suddenly disappeared I'm
honestly not sure I'd be able to keep
doing what I'm doing full-time I'd have
to use my BS PE or my MBA and be a
financier or an engineer somewhere but I
don't want to do that I like doing this
I love this job I love the fact that I
can make videos like these compiled
around stats gathered from an entire
2018 calendar year it's like a
presentation with that I'll conclude the
video one of the questions do you have
about our finances I won't give away
specific numbers for obvious reasons but
I'll try my best to clarify any policy
by which we abide I think transparency
is important I know Linus did a video
similar to this maybe a year or two ago
I wish smaller channels would do this
because it's an interesting interesting
deep dive maybe you guys learned a few
things about how we how we run things
and that way going forward you won't be
surprised by some of the tactics that we
have when it comes to pre-rolls or
Computex CES coverage whatever with that
if you liked the video thumbs up you
know what to do click the red subscribe
button if you haven't already and become
a member by clicking the join button if
you are feeling especially lucky I
appreciate all your support even if it's
just something as simple as watching
this video yes even if you're running ad
blocker I don't get Jack when you run an
ad blocker or watching this video but
the view itself still helps I mean if
anything it just shows that our channel
is still driving traffic and it helps me
sell some ads some external promotional
content for you guys and if you buy
products through our affiliate links
that helps us a ton as you just saw as
well this is science studio thanks for
watching thanks for learning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
