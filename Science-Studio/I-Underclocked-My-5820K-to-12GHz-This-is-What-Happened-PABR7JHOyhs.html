to point out that these tests were
conducted because I was curious that's
it there's nothing else to it there's no
rhyme or reason behind it other than the
fact that I wanted to see what would
happen when I severely under clocked my
5820k I don't recommend doing this it
wouldn't make much sense apart from
power consumption decline a much cooler
system and a much quieter one as a
result there is absolutely no reason why
you should drop your CPU frequency down
to 1.2 gigahertz or thereabouts doesn't
matter what processor you're sporting
what CPU cooler you're using just don't
do it why did I do it you asked whoa
whoa wait wait yeah that did it yeah
bitch
magnets Oh what you're about to see is a
side-by-side comparison between a 5820k
running at 1.2 gigahertz and point 8
volts that was the lowest I could drop
the voltage without the computer
refusing to boot up and the same cpu
running at 4.6 gigahertz and 1.32 volts
with a minimal graphics card bottleneck
how large of a framerate disparity will
we see in modern triple-a titles let's
start off first with a few synthetics I
ran I 264 first to check temps and make
sure both clocks were stable on the left
is the under clocked run the right the
overclocked one our temps literally did
not change during the extent of our
under clocked run something I suppose
shouldn't be too surprising given the
voltage applied but it's still surreal
to see an X 99 CPU running at this
temperature under load on the other hand
the overclock scenario yielded
temperatures that were extremely
uncomfortable the voltage applied was
perfectly fine and stable but the 240
millimeter AIO I was using just couldn't
dissipate heat quick enough even with
its pomp and fans at their max RPMs for
the record I run the CPU at 1.31 volts
and 4.5 gigahertz for this very reason
next up with Cinebench r15 and as you
can probably tell the under clock test
resulted in a huge cv score cut almost
75% by the time the tests finally
finished we managed a mere 317 something
even my Q 6600 laughs at Geekbench
mirror these findings roughly 70% cut
for the 1.2 gigahertz run in this case
something worth mentioning here is how
drastically the multi-core
or change compared to that of this
single-core when you have more
overclockable cores at your disposal
overall performance can significantly
jump it's what makes the x99 chipset so
appealing but only if the games and
programs being used are able to take
advantage of the core surplus now let's
throw a few games is severely under
clocked beast is it actually is it even
a beast if it's running at 1.2 gigahertz
the answer is a big fat no check out
this side-by-side comparison of the GTA
5 benchmark there is an enormous
framerate disparity and we can analyze
it in two different ways the first is
from a simple minimum and average
framerate bar graph 135 versus 48 frames
per second on average is a stellar
representation of how important CPU
frequency is to a degree there's another
way we can look at this frame times
instead of looking at this in terms of
frames per second let's try milliseconds
per frame in this case we're looking for
a flat and consistent line with minimal
spikes the 1.2 gigahertz run was all
over the place and finishes quicker
because fewer frames were drawn overall
the 4.6 gigahertz run is a very flat and
linear line devoid of spikes this is
exactly what we want to see a good
indicator of a well balanced system for
this game I'm running two gtx 1070 s and
sli by the way so GP bottlenecking
should be minimal the only game on our
list that's not properly sli optimized
is city skylines explained and verified
right here but even with only one GPU
breaking a sweat it was a CPU that held
us back substantially both the average
and minimum frame rates were utterly
disappointing for the 1.2 gigahertz chip
19 FPS on average wouldn't even cut it
in the console sphere hue and check out
that minimum seven single digits let's
move on how about a GPU bound title in
the video I pointed to a bit earlier we
verify that Witcher 3 on ultra settings
is a graphics card hog maxing out both
10 70s consistently in this scenario
however the CPUs abysmal frequency
played far too greater role in frame
rate reduction these disparities aren't
the worst we've seen thus far but it's
important to note that even GPU bound
titles can be CPU bound in the right
situations lastly we have battlefield 1
not a title I expected to perform as
well as it did frankly you're looking at
a side-by-side comparison
here can you tell which is which in this
instance battlefields craving Coors
overclocks something I expect will
become the norm by the turn of the
decade directx12 in Vulcan will
accelerate this trend but for now
battlefield one remains one of the few
games demanding more than four cores in
which case the lower frequency isn't as
pivotal it's still clearly lower the
overall frame rate but not by the degree
I expected it to to keep this one short
and sweet don't do what I did there is
absolutely no point
don't buy a locked Xeon running at one
point whatever gigahertz and don't limit
yourself to locked SKUs in general if
you're certain your graphics card can
pull its own weight if you thought this
video was interesting give it a thumbs
up give it a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite or if you hate
