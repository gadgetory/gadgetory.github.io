card when it came out more powerful than
the 980ti and Maxwell Titan X and with
prices now on the decline for a Pascal
something we predicted a while back on a
kind of cryptocurrency mine a decline
and the release of Turing the 1080 is
actually looking pretty sweet especially
when seen in the context of those Turing
launch prices so if you aren't
interested in paying more than say 400
bucks I don't blame you this card can
still handle nearly anything you throw
at it
even in 4k but what about the gtx 1070
TI this card hasn't gotten as much love
lately and i have a theory as to why but
I first want to compare the two from a
performance perspective and assess
prices so that you can make the most
informed purchase decision possible in
this category because these cards right
here are among some of the best bang for
the buck cards you can currently buy
this matchup was a fun one and I took an
interesting approach because I've heard
so many things along the lines of Oh a
custom 10 780 I can match a stock 10 80
and I've always wanted to test this
firsthand so I took the EVGA GTX 10 ATSC
using a reference PCB that I purchased
from eBay for 300 bucks more on that
right here and slung it head-to-head
against our beefy three slot gtx 1070 TI
for the win both of these cards are from
EVGA but only the 1070 I again boasts a
custom atom board the 1080 here utilizes
the reference design so it won't have
any power delivery and overclocking
advantages save the possible thermal
advantages associated with a third-party
cooler though the founders edition
coolers are actually pretty effective
both of these cards are extremely quiet
and cool and that's another reason to go
with an aftermarket cooler EVGA does an
excellent job in general both custom and
reference boards i've never had a
problem to date but where do you think
these to fall on the leaderboard
obviously the 1070 is gonna be a little
weaker than the 1080 but does the price
difference there justify the gap in
performance let's find out so the
platform I used for benchmarking both of
these cards was my personal gaming rig
sporting a core i7 8700 K 16 gigs of DDR
4 in a modest overclock of 4.8 gigahertz
it's a pretty you know hardcore gaming
rig if you want the best of the best in
terms of gaming then the 8700 K is the
best one to buy right now everything
remain unchanged throughout these tests
and the graphics cards themselves were
not manually overclocked past their
out-of-the-box frequencies so first came
up was grand theft out of five
this one was tested in 1440p with maxed
out settings across the board save a
four times anti-aliasing scale and what
you're looking at here are frame times
pertaining to the last scene in the
built in benchmark frame times are the
inverse of fps so everything above this
line indicates an FPS reading below 60
which is what we don't want we averaged
about 79 fps the GTX 1080 and around 68
FPS for the 1070 TI keep in mind that
the TI has an advantage here thanks to
its custom PCB and higher load
tolerances so if we benchmark to
founders Edition cards for example we
should expect a slightly larger gap
between them now I'm choosing to show
frame time graphs instead of FPS charts
because these provides slightly more
insight into the raw frame spike
something you wouldn't otherwise see
with 1% of point one percent lo graphs
things became less consistent over here
and we'd never get to see these
variances with again those other charts
the 1070 TI it falls slightly behind
across the board and sports slightly
higher frame time spikes something
remember we want to see less up we want
more consistent flat and lo lines on
this chart I would like to point out
however that the two games are nearly
impossible to distinguish at this
resolution and with these presets
without the FPS counters it'd be like a
50/50 toss-up so the decision between
the 1070 TI and 1080 here would
ultimately come down to pricing and
availability simply because you can't
really see the difference between the
two in the real world will show these
tests with other games later in the
video the next game tested was f1 2017
funny enough this game appeared much
more stable within this graph depicts
and that's again why this graph is so
important to show a majority of this
benchmark for both cards yielded flat
and reliable frame times however several
intermittent instances resulted in
render times approaching 25 milliseconds
that's roughly 40 FPS now after the
beginning of the benchmark we see things
level off significantly with only a few
spikes pushing that 60 FPS barrier at
sixteen point seven milliseconds overall
though the GTX 1080 averaged about 94
fps
the 1070 TI only a few frames behind at
86
up next is pub G and this folks is what
an unauthorized game looks like with
respect to frame times these large
spikes are indicative of extreme and
random lags in-game amounting to nearly
1/4 of one second at times which sounds
insignificant I know but I can assure
you it makes a world of difference in a
game like this it's the difference
between being shot and shooting at
somebody else so this test was conducted
with medium presets mind you save a
reduction in foliage and a boost in draw
distance this is just how I play the
game
the average frame rates for both cards
were actually pretty good though
eternity pushed out around 122 FPS here
while the 1070 TI minutes 109 yet the TI
struggled quite a bit more at times to
maintain this average which again is why
a chart like this is so important in the
grand scheme of things it just helps you
visualize those random lags a bit better
I tested Rhys with a Tomb Raider as kind
of a last hoorah before moving over to
shadow of the Tomb Raider for testing
purposes and I was sure to run it in
DirectX 12 to throw these cards a
curveball dx12 runs like an absolute dog
in this game and we see that indicated
vaguely by the minimums across all three
instances for both cards it actually
appears as though the GTX 1080 struggled
slightly more in this regard though Mike
couldn't run the frame time counters
using fraps because the software isn't
compatible as an overlay with the
DirectX 12 API I'll show a side-by-side
comparison a little later lastly we have
Witcher 3 always a great graphics card
limiter thanks to its dynamic setting an
array of endgame features we were
bottlenecked by our graphics cards for
sure' in both scenarios at which point
the gap between both cards became
extremely narrow we managed just over 60
FPS that threshold there in both cases
with a gtx and 80 pulling just a couple
of frames ahead on average at 64 had we
enabled hair works for example we'd have
seen these frame rates a drop into the
mid 40s there were a few spikes here and
there for both runs but in general I'd
call this one a tie the differences here
are just too small to accurately measure
now I want to throw up side-by-side
comparisons of both cards running the
games we've benchmarked in order to make
my next point if you're worried about
the tiny Delta's between these two on
paper
don't be there's really no reason to be
in all honesty I'll be thrown the 1070
TI back into my personal rig so I can
run future tests between the 1080 and
2080 and I can say for certain that I
won't miss the 1080 there's really no
noticeable difference they're so close
in many instances that you want likely
to notice which card is running on which
side go ahead take a guess which one of
these scenes was rendered by the GTX
1080 thank you god the answer here's the
right answer and if you got it right you
might have guessed even if I had left
frame counters on screen you'd be
hard-pressed to distinguish between the
two and that's why the gtx 1070 TI is a
great value proposition in the new
market inventory levels for these cards
are still extremely high so prices are
relatively low they just barely dodged
the mining craze and have leveled out
from a price perspective since so here's
the conclusion I think you should take
away from this the gtx 1070 TI is still
perfectly viable in 2018 same goes
obviously for the 1080 but if you can
find a comparable 1070 TI brand new for
say 50 bucks or so cheaper than its 1080
counterpart the 1070 TI is the better
Buy in my opinion if both prices are
within say 20 or 30 bucks of each other
the 1080 s marginal lead becomes a
little more justifiable at the end of
the day the only way you'll probably be
able to tell which card you're running
in your system is if a you have a super
beefy you know add-in board 1080 that's
gonna bring some really stellar
overclocks which is rare for Pascal or
if you have a transparent side panel and
you can literally see what's written on
the card
the 1070 Ti is a viability in the market
was always questionable from the
beginning but in videos I mean they're
competing with themselves here and
there's really nothing wrong with that
so long as the prices themselves aren't
all extremely high but one thing's for
sure the 1070 Ti is one heck of a card
if you can find it below 400 bucks
brand-new and by the way if you are
wondering about youth graphics card
prices I invite you to check out this
video right here I'm gonna brag just a
little bit you can find GTX 10 studies
for as low as 220 bucks on eBay I found
two of them for that cheap in great
condition by the way the 1080 that I
showed in this video I bought for $300
that's literally I mean that's below a
1070 price and then rx 580 use GTX 970 s
and 1060 s are all up there for well
under 200 bucks if you know how and
where to look so if you aren't afraid to
dabble in the used market you
usually covered by the eBay pirate
protection guarantee if the thing
doesn't work just to return it there's
really no risk there just some time that
you lost having to ship the thing back
and wait for your money to arrive I say
go for the use market that's my take
right now if you want to save money if
you don't want to spend 800 bucks on a
New York TX card or a TX 1080i that's
brand-new the use market is perfectly
viable and in all honesty sometimes you
can get even better
you know combinations of cards if you
want to get to 10 ATS for example for
300 bucks apiece 1080 is an SLI assuming
the game supports this whole I will I'll
perform a single GT X 1080 Ti so there's
that also if you want to flip these
cards you can easily do that in the use
of the market so let me know what you
think in the comments below about the
use market and what you saw in this
video thumbs up if you liked it dislike
it if you feel the complete opposite or
if you hate everything about life you
guys can click that red subscribe button
if you haven't already you can join us
become a channel member if you want to
get fancy with it and we'll catch you in
the next video this is science studio
thanks for learning with us by the way
for those who stuck around to the very
end I want to know what you think
specifically about the charts shown in
this video I purposely avoided bar
charts and I know that's gonna make a
few people feel uncomfortable maybe I'll
upload a separate video talking about
how frame time charts work what you're
exactly seeing and I'm not just gonna
summarize it I'm actually dedicate a
whole video to that so if you think
that'll be necessary that's fine if you
don't want to see these kinds of graphs
anymore that's fine as well again this
is kind of an experiment I just feel
like these kinds of graphs relay more
information than the 1% of poem sent
load charts at least in these cases
because those kind of summarize those
Peaks in the frame time charts but you
don't actually get to see those trends
over time especially when they're over
lapped card for court so we're gonna
leave a comment down below if you watch
it to the end and let me know
specifically what you think about the
graphs and what I should do in the
future thanks for watching guys I'll
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
