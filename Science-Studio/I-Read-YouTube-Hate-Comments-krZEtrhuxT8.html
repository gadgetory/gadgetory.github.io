backlash particularly in the comment
section check it out right here for more
context let's read a few shit title shit
thumbnail made me ignore this video
longer than it usually does when I see
you release something consoles can go
fuck themselves they're all pieces of
shit compared to dual 1080s and my 6800
K what if that price tag look like as
much of a clickbait title as it is the
scorpio will not beat this 6700 K and
1070 I just build so fuck off also that
shitty altro will always guarantee a
dislike for me even though the content
is great I don't know if I want to thank
you or hate you but I don't know I don't
know do I do both I swear this channel
name had science in it did he change it
or I'm going crazy just don't tell him
this guy doesn't know what he's talking
about when it comes to optimization even
though I released about 4 videos
covering optimization it's not 1070
performance dumbass teraflops means
nothing for the performance of a card
it's core clocks and memory clocks looks
like the Down syndrome McLovin fat-ass
has turned you into a click baiting
retard but hey anything to pay off them
college loans right it's off with two
F's and you spelled McLovin wrong where
did you pull this information out your
ass
kill yourself Microsoft come on it's
just going to be another crappy console
that people waste money on jesus H
Christ how blind are you to think that a
console even compares to a PC well a
shill is gonna shill and candid don't
pay all the bills I guess AMD /
Microsoft are now pitching in
yeah I'm just rolling in dough dude your
peasantry is disappointing unsubbed this
is person not know that I don't have a
console funny joke
cute username true 4k my ass why the
clickbait title you know that shit is
false consoles are a single release in
between years PC can be upgraded every
single month and
Tech will destroy whatever you throw at
it the next day
clickbait ain't your style son look at
your dislikes just for that shit console
peasants seriously I don't think you
have heard about how the console renders
4k I said in the video that I don't play
games on consoles so many stupid things
are said in this video what's bugging me
more is why aren't we talking about the
damn hair or fluff hanging from your
chin did you have a string slash hair
stuck in your beard flash stubble thing
yes I had that stuck in my stubble thing
I just didn't realize it when I was
filming real titles we are slowly
watching Greg lose his sanity you just
went full peasant just for that
clickbait title oh look this ugly faggot
does clickbait now I want to know why he
doesn't have a profile picture
I'm not thumbing you down for
disagreeing but I'm summing you down for
it just being a bad video the sheer
amount of assumptions and predictions
you had to use to come to your
conclusion meant that even if you came
to the opposite conclusion this would
still be a bad video full of personal
bias and effectively guesswork very
clickbait tea video title I used to like
your channel because it was about real
things if this is what your devolve into
just to get views I'm unsubscribing now
gl if it's just one video it sound like
a trend this video is satire why are so
many people responding as if it is
serious
Thank You unn since crabbin because
you're a dirty console peasant so now
you're bored of building the same white
pc over and over again you want to buy a
white ps4 and make twenty videos about
it this person is aware that we were
talking about the Xbox right you've lost
it dude used to love your videos but
this stuff is just awful you can tell
he's really a console peasant because he
thinks the only reason we play PC is
because of graphics yeah and we can tell
that you're new to the channel peasant
oh my god one more bullshit video like
this and I'll unsubscribe I fucking
swear do you have brain damage come on
Greg is this supposed to be a troll vid
why are you trying to
advocate for closed system console oh
dear
you know the hate train is coming your
way that's right Garrett you're a
prophet let's just not get carried away
wait a minute dude the only thing I was
seeing in the video is that cat hair
hanging from your chin unless you're a
millionaire no one cares about 4k nice
bait mate well thank you oMG he took
money from Microsoft syndicate did the
same thing
OMG I'm going to dislike on this video's
title even though I'm a console peasant
what what are you asking for dislikes I
was actually asking for rude comments
but it's like the work - I came
exclusively - thumbs down because of the
thumbnail it's almost as bad as my
profile picture
well played Sean well played clickbait
titles that dislike speak for themselves
this is all speculation so stop whoring
for views unsubbed well that's all the
hate mail I have for this video thanks
for watching I do want to say there than
in reference to the Scorpio video yes a
great deal of what I said was a parody I
figured you guys would catch on once I
compared an i-5 7600 K GTX 1070 combo
which I've owned and have tested to a
console I don't care about the console
market I don't even own a console if you
know anything about this channel you
know that it's mostly been about PC
that's where it's at it's the only place
where I game I think it's the only place
where you should game either so to
apologize if you guys thought that I was
trying to convince you to sell your PC's
and buy Xbox skorpios for whatever
reason nonetheless it made for some
interesting comments and an interesting
hopefully funny video I just wanted to
be entertaining if you liked it give it
a thumbs up subscribe if you haven't
already I'll catch you in the next video
this is sound as our studio thanks for
learning with this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
