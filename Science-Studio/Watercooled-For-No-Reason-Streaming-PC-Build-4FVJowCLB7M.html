knees right now because I'm using a PC
case box as a makeshift desk for the
time being I just put together a custom
loop for a streaming PC which really
makes no sense but I decided to go over
the top here and I like the way it looks
maybe we use it a showpiece when we do
live streams from now on you'll find
there's an ad for media capture card in
there we'll talk about that in a second
but for now time to get to the tech porn
all right so let's talk about what
changed since what you just saw in the
b-roll first off the loop is different
it's configured differently there are
two bends that I had to redo and
actually flip-flop based on the ports on
the reservoir because the reservoir has
a dedicated import and a dedicated out
port at least on the right side I mean
on the left side excuse me so I'm using
both of those on the left which means
that only one is an import only one is
an out port those were flip-flops so I
actually had the the pump was fading the
the import on the reservoir whereas it
should have been the other way around
right the reservoir should be feeding
the pump and because I did it the other
way around we had a lot of air bubbles
in the loop there's still a bunch of air
bubbles and loop I think it's just
because of the nature of the reservoir
don't think it's supposed to be set
vertically like this but it should be
okay for streaming ladies it's not like
a gaming PC I could use some heavy you
know CPU rendering on here so this will
be okay it's pretty quiet and that was
the goal and it looks pretty good too
now a bit more on this fantex reservoir
you can actually find it linked below in
the video description
it is not on sale as of the publishing
date of this video but it will be very
soon and I encourage you to at least
consider it if you're gonna use you know
use something like this for custom loop
it looks phenomenal fantex always makes
beautiful blocks and this reservoir is
no exception
it actually includes an integrated RGB
LED strip which I did not throw in there
because I already have a strip kind of
running up top here and I haven't
configured it to be honest I haven't
even plugged this into a monitor yet so
I haven't done anything to the PC it's
just running stock for the first time
booting up but this strip is from cable
mod as are the cables that I showed you
earlier and the strip has RGB W
compatibility also UV compatibility so
really everything in one big wide strip
and it runs all the way across the
chassis up top now onto these sexy
cables I teased them a bit earlier in
the b-roll but I really want to just
like focus on these for a second because
they have really stepped up their game
with the pro series which is what we're
sporting here I decided to go with a
simple almost monochromatic
so a black and gray color scheme of
course to complement the Gigabyte
designer or designee or however you want
to call it
x2 9i motherboard so the silver theme
with that also the corsair dominator
Platinum's so the silver accents are
definitely there and that's why I
included a bit of silver in the 24 pin
cable the rest of the cables though the
VGA the the card cable also the EPS
cables up top are black and I just I
wanted to keep it that way didn't want
to go over the top with anything too
colorful now the pro series cables from
cable mod will cost a bit more I'll
admit but they are worth it so if you
want to buy a new set of cables you
don't want to you know sleeve them
yourselves or or ask a friend over and
over like I do with Tony because Tony
supplies mid cables left and right and
his cables are excellent if you want to
plug a company for one so you can go to
cable mod and set those up via the link
below if you want to configure your own
set of cables like I've done you can
check out their configurator and you
won't be disappointed at all with any
set of cables really that you choose
from but I won't with nylon here or no
paracord excuse me it's a paracord pair
quarter nylon I get confused I think
it's paracord and the pro series cable
is there but if you want to go with
nylon course you're gonna have that like
shinier Sheen to the cables they'll be a
bit tougher a bit more rigid but they'll
all look great as long as you get the
color scheme right I don't think it'd be
disappointed at all now the case I chose
is the fractal design define see it's
not the tempered-glass edition because
that case is currently being used for
another project so I just went with the
standard acrylic model still looks great
I still think this is one of the best
cases you can possibly buy right now and
check out the cable management career I
really wanna highlight this so on the
right side of this case it is such an
easy task to manage and route cables on
this right side I would say considering
how compact this case is it has the best
cable management like setup period you
just have so much space near the front
there with that little indention it does
limit you to just ATX motherboards but I
really think this is a worthy trade-off
because sliding the right panel on with
such ease is just I don't know there's
no feeling like it now that's really
about it for the specs that you know
nothing too special in here I'm reusing
the UH 970 100x again that was from the
the winter build what that build was
destroyed the CPU seems to be working
that's great
but I want to touch lastly on the
capture card that was the point of this
build after all right was to make this a
streaming PC so we do have a capture
card from avermedia here the live gamer
HD - this is only a 1080p 60 capable
capturecard I plan to run an external
camera to this and then will be able to
up the ante when it comes to live
streams in the future which is why this
build exists in the first place we know
we could have gone with something like
an elgato 4k you know $400 capture card
but we're not looking to streaming for
work anytime soon the band width is just
it's really not there for us at this
point I don't really think it's
necessary either I think most of you
guys prefer 60fps
with the live stream aspect at least and
then the crispy 4k shots when it comes
to videos like these so that's why we
went with the cheaper solution here from
avermedia you can find it link in the
video description along with all the
other parts used in this build I'd like
to thank alpha cool for resupplying the
parts I've actually reused these parts
Malvika like three times now the very
durable the fantex reservoir we've
reused some thermaltake components like
the pump and the pump housing as well as
this cool little low temperature meter
down here so what are you running at 31
degrees Celsius not bad at idle so if
you liked this video or at least this
really awkward camera angle be sure to
let me know give this one a thumbs up I
appreciate it thumbs down for the
Pacific subscribe but if you have an
ardent stay tuned for more content like
this this is science studio thanks for
building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
