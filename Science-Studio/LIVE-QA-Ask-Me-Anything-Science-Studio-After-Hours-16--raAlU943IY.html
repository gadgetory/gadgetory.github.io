sorry about that I was Challen on some
dope chicken noodle soup made by lovely
Lisa she's pretty consistent when it
comes to the chicken noodle soup you
know when your woman can cook chicken
noodle you know you're doing fine
so uh we are seeing the suggestions of
what I should have said that's funny we
have very special just kidding this is
totally like the same thing happens
every week segment here on after hours
where I answer your questions and that's
basically all we do because like I feel
like a lot of people I'm gonna say kind
of what I said I was talking to Lisa
about this earlier you know a lot of the
guys out there do a lot of like the tech
news and stuff and they're pretty good
at what they do right they've been doing
it for a long time you know Paul Kyle
Bryan from tech yes City does it a lot
and I just I don't feel like doing the
same things especially saying is a word
on a Sunday night right so or Monday
morning depending on where you live if I
look tired it's because I went to the
beach by the way so I'm pretty like
sun-blasted but yeah I feel like this
those stories just get recycled by so
many tech tubers and I just don't want
to fall under that same kind of role
where I'm just repeating the same stuff
others already have so in this in this
scenario here it gives you a bit of a
bit more I don't know of a personal
touch I think when I'm just answering
questions all I'm here for and so we're
gonna try something different this time
if you guys follow me on Twitter you
know that I asked for all of your
questions and I want to give those
questions priority this time around like
if you don't want Twitter next time we
can try we can try Facebook or we can
try Instagram Center this camera just a
bit better it doesn't matter to me hide
but just some outlet other than the chat
box where you guys can have a better
chance in my peaking I feel like I'm
peaking let's fix that okay just another
area where I feel like you guys can send
questions and I can go through those in
a list where they're already kind of
pre-sorted versus here I kind of just
got a scroll up and try to find the best
ones now you can still ask questions via
the chat box that
what it's there for it's why I'm showing
it on screen so I encourage you guys to
still ask ask those and very important
questions like Jeffrey eight six nine
six just asked why tornadoes only
touchdown in trailer parks we all know
that's not true but it's pretty funny
that you should say I mean it's not
funny but it's just when you think of a
tornado touching down it's always the
trailer parts right and I feel like
those are the ones that get exposed the
most I'm gonna answer this question
legit I feel like those are the ones
that can cover the most because trailer
homes are typically built cheaper
they're built with lighter materials and
tornadoes tend to do the most
devastation to those so when you see
them covered usually the bricks
you know the full-on brick and stone and
cement structures if they're not
standing and they you know if they're
still not as bad as like the totally
destroyed mobile homes and those are the
ones should we see pictures of so that
might be why we have a stereotype of
sorts when it comes to tornadoes in
trailer parks boom didn't think you'd
hear about that on science do - did you
see see you guys anything goes here as
long as I feel it's relevant to science
in general or what we talked about on
the channel normally so I see a bunch of
your questions on Twitter if you guys
want a better chance for me to answer
your question you can find my tweet it's
pretty much up the top on my profile and
you can submit your question via that
tweet the link to this live stream by
the way is there so we're gonna start
off with a few Twitter questions and I'm
gonna scroll by see you guys asked me
some good questions in the chat as well
let's see here Cody I totally trust you
enough to make you a mod let me let me
help me hook you up boom there you go
thanks by the way for your continued
sponsorship I do appreciate that you
know it's it's just a few bucks but it
really just go a long way I don't even
know if I've actually I guess I've seen
I guess if you guys have been known for
two months or so then uh then you're
loyal I appreciate the extra kickback
that you guys give us okay so start off
with a few Twitter questions here I want
to start off first my good friend Mark
Bateman Mark asked do you think LeBron
going to to LA makes the NBA better it
works we kind of touched on this in the
last after-hours livestream although I
hadn't known at the time that it was
actually official that he was legit
gonna move there and look what this
tells me is that it does all about money
not that this is
news to anybody but this literally has
nothing to do with but where people feel
like playing where they feel welcome all
this sappy stuff it's all about money
who pays the most who has the the
biggest most you know just solid
contract out there where you see
prospects in the future where you see
your team going right with the other
team mates that you have with the out
with LA Lakers and with where he was
before with Cleveland and where he was
at Miami I'm he was kind of jumping all
over but I feel like I feel like LeBron
just wants another win bad and going to
going to LA is just pretty much I mean
those were one of the two or three big
teams out there in terms of the money
behind them so yeah I think the guy just
wants another win another W and I don't
blame him for that it's why he plays
right he plays for the money plays
because his fani plays because he wants
to win there's nothing wrong with that
but I think this ultimately just reveals
that it's all about money anyway yeah
talking about basketball in science
studio I just totally contradicted what
I said a second ago but here we go
another one this is from Brian Stroh bps
Kustoms going on Brian I met Brian in
real life at CES and he is a top-notch a
dude he says dearest Greg do you love
your new car follow-up why do you wish
you were still in the why do you wish
you were still in the Audi club he's
assuming I wish I was still in the Audi
club and then PPS a CES in January we
should totally race dune buggies loser
keeps the Infinity we will be doing that
I love my new car I love it it's really
it's just an all-around solid car it's a
newer car than the s5 was and it's
faster it's noticeably faster
I love forced induction engines I I just
I don't know I feel like they're more
tunable they might not be more reliable
but they're just more fun to drive this
one's not a stick shift or anything that
you would think of like a fun to drive
kind of car this is a totally like daily
drivable car but it's fast it's peppy
when you want it it's a coupe it's got
like a nice like red leather interior I
love it it's kind of just like the s5
was but just in an improved state and it
comes with a really dope warranty so
yeah that's my reasoning behind the
purchase do I wish I was still in the
audience early I miss Quattro I miss
hall
especially Audi's version of it they're
one of the best in the business when it
comes to that so the grip yeah I miss it
I don't miss how much the s5 weighed and
I don't miss the sketchy reliability
concerns I had with the longevity of the
car
Jaden Harper on the chat and YouTube
asks are you in deutschland right now
and the answer is no I'm here in the
studio in Florida Lisa is here with me
Lisa has got to go back to Germany in
this week so Wednesday I've got to drop
her after the airport
she's got some weddings to go to back
home and so it's gonna be another sad
goodbye but you know what sucks is were
kind of used to it like we're kind of
used to already saying goodbye so many
times and being apart for months it's
it's something I wouldn't wish on
anybody so hopefully at some point in
your future we can get it to where we
can be together all the time and not
have to say goodbye it's really weird
have to say goodbye periodically to your
own wife okay I see Trojan with a for
gaming what desk under 50 inches wide
would you recommend for a dual monitor
setup okay so that's a interesting
question I think if it's under 50 inches
wide then you're gonna have serious
concerns trying to fit two monitors and
a PC on your desk I don't know I'm just
trying to picture it in my head right
now if you have to 24 inch monitors
which is the smallest I would recommend
you go and then you try to fit something
like an S 340 elite or a fan tax P 400
what have you a nice mid-sized tower
case it's gonna be pretty cramped up
there you might have to have your
monitor hanging over the side a little
bit make sure I think it doesn't really
matter in my book how long the desk is
unless you want to put two full-on
setups on your desks I think it matters
more in terms of width like if your
depth if you have more like front to
back space we have all this breathing
room in front of you before you get to
the monitor you'll be much better off so
I wouldn't worry too much about the
length of the case or the length of the
desk unless you have like literal size
constraints in your room okay I'm going
to scroll back up just a little bit here
I have a question from okay this is
actually kind of ties in the dual
monitor so so Pat juicebox adolfo asks
in regards to dual monitor setups would
you personally have
two of the same monitor for consistency
or two different models for versatility
with one having a wide color gamut for
content creation for example the other
having like a high refresh rate for
gaming so this is interesting I never
looked it this way and that's actually a
really smart idea the problem is I'm too
OCD to do it so I need the panels to be
if they're gonna be like side by side
like these two here these are the exact
same model from thank you exactly the
same and I'm just so clinical about how
I set things up I really kind of anal
about it sometimes I just like the way
things look the way that I like them and
they sometimes have to give Lisa crap
because she'll change what I setup and
like like that doesn't look good to me
and you know everyone has a preference
everyone's objective and it comes it
looks so I kind of something I've had to
compromise on but I would be willing to
forego like the just marginal
improvements when it comes to like color
gamut and just go for like an all-around
fair middle ground when it comes to
monitors so if I could get two monitors
that have a decent srgb spectrum you
know anywhere between 95 and 99 percent
srgb that's really all I'm concerned
about I'm not worried about the Adobe
RGB stuff but I'm not that particular
when it comes to color grading and
whatnot it's will is spamming the
discord so if you guys didn't already
pick up on that he is absolutely
destroying you guys in the chat so join
the discord if you guys want to get more
engaged I hop in there every now and
then it's a tag team with Brian from
techie s city if you guys want to ask
them used pots questions brian is
definitely the guy for that he's done
you know
full-on hands-on tests with a ton of the
old hardware and he still does it that's
what's so cool it's like it's still
recent I'm going to sign into the
discord right now just so I make sure
that I don't leave anybody out over
there the discord by the way is free to
join and it's linked down below so check
it out if you haven't already
all right let's hop back over here to
the chat Aaron asked if McLovin is dead
the answer is no he is alive and you
will actually see him very soon and he
guys are excited about this about that
stay tuned okay let's see scrolling up
scrolling up
here we go
actually my scroll down a little bit
okay st. Frank asked Gregg who's your
favorite content creator on YouTube it's
got to be Doug demure oh I actually
answered a similar question in the last
after-hours live stream but I love Doug
I love what he's done and I love what
he's made out of his channel just from
purely his own personality the guy is
what he is in terms of like his channel
growth his popularity that he owes all
of that to his own personality his
quirkiness the just the friendly kind of
reviews that actually still contain
reliable and decent info when he's when
he's running through the cars when he's
driving the car is the feedback he gives
you it's just all genuine and I think
people appreciate that okay do you think
gamers should be pissed that triple-a
titles aren't optimizing for modern
hardware this is from Robinson Joe I
don't know it I mean there are a few
games sure that aren't very well
optimized but I'm not sure in general
this is the trend I haven't heard of
like I don't have people coming to me
all the time complaining about it like
optimization is always gonna be an issue
and it ultimately comes down to the
developers themselves you know this is
stuff that's way beyond me like when it
comes to game programming game code and
how to utilize things via API is like
DirectX 11 12
Volken what have you but this is
something that it is a constant
continual process like if you don't
update your games and you just play when
it releases and you've got a problem
because you're not gonna get those
updates that do refresh usually the
hardware that you might be sporting that
wasn't out when the game launched you
know you never know
so I recommend staying on top of updates
and most triple-a titles will have
updates that will improve utilization
over time I think pub G is like the
prime example of that pub G has
massively improved in terms of how it
utilizes Hardware over the past six
months alone okay but see the good stuff
mr. OG gamer asked to Greg 2700 X and GT
x 1080 for the one to four 1080p
144 Hertz at max settings you could
totally do that
I think the 2700 X is it's good it's
good
depending on the game you might not be
able to max everything out but I mean
the 1080 is gonna be it's gonna be a
future-proof graph
card for the next few years so I would
say yeah in 1080p no problem that's
gonna put more leverage on your CPU but
you get a 2700 X there if you want to do
extra things in the background you
should have no problem at all yeah I
would say I wouldn't stress max settings
and they'll be very high settings in
most games and I've tested almost that
exact config so I can tell you firsthand
that is it's a good combo ok we have a
question from Adam Stephenson in the
YouTube chat what do you think of the
fan text and though looks in its overall
airflow to work with the entha
one sick I want to make sure that I'm
not confusing ok this is the one that's
been been out for a while I don't this
case first hand I do not know I used to
build in ok so it was like the end
though em I want to say is that what it
was the end om acrylic yeah the end
though proem or just the regular end om
if you don't have tempered glass model
those cases I never really was worried
too much about air flow because they
have that front grille there but the end
though looks does look like it has a
slightly restricted front panel so I
don't know I got to put my hands on the
case I haven't actually built in it so I
can't answer you know can't answer it
fully ok scrolling up I see another good
one I see another good one here we go
Christopher Ortega is there a big
difference between high settings and
ultra settings it depends on the title
obviously but I think in a general sense
high settings to ultra settings is going
to mean the difference between you know
two time anti-aliasing and eight times
anti-aliasing and there's going to be a
huge difference there in terms of how
hard your GPUs got to work to edit it to
just smooth out those jagged edges and
games so probably yeah
ok we have one from 741 more gaming Greg
please answer our 320 200 G with a 1080
or an r5 2400 G with a 1070 TI or an r5
8400 with the 1070 I'm on a very tight
budget and these three fit perfectly
which one you recommend you've got to
give me more details 741 more gaming you
tell me what resolution you want to play
in what do you what you looking to do
with it you just want a game you want a
content create I need more more info I
can't just I can tell you just if I was
building a PC for just general use I
would probably go with the I don't I
don't really see the point in going with
our 520 400 she if you're gonna pair it
with a discrete card anyway I would just
say I don't know what wills telling me
will what are you talking about but I
would try to work a little higher into
like r5 1600 or 2600 territory and
combine that with a 1070 or ten seventy
TI and you'll be perfectly fine okay I
see I would see here more this is one
that was just asked more ruin good god I
butchered that he asked at science
studio what tips do you give me for
trading PC parts to get a decent PC I
have a literally how to buy and sell pcs
on Craigslist video check that out
that's why it's up there so instead of
me taking all the time answer here that
video is there just for you what's going
on Brian Greg I'll ask you anything what
is the meaning of life and you better
say at Z on how did I know you were
gonna say that uh yeah dude look I need
more hands on experience with Zeon's
I've built with I think to Zeon's in my
life well not not to but I think I have
two full on videos on my channel that
are dedicated to Z on builds so I need I
need the inside scoop man I need I need
you to help me a little more we talked
about this when we do the tech world TV
on your end but yeah I need to be a
little refreshed with the current Z on
offerings both in the used any markets
just to see what I can get best bang for
the buck wise we have problem not here
Marwan that's how you say okay Gio
Sebastian Greg are you a dog person I
actually have a cat I don't have dogs
right now but I have cats and dogs I
think has and dogs have different traits
that are worth mentioning and addressing
you know their cat people and dog people
I think I'm both
I don't really care one way or the other
I think cats are more chill they're
quiet they kind of do their own thing
and that's awesome dogs are more
personal they're more friendly but
they're just there's a little more
maintenance involved so it depends on
how you look at it but I think both have
their qualities I wouldn't mind owning
both cats and dogs okay and con Gower
asks are your views on Microsoft Surface
book good for general use
I don't like Microsoft's markups with
their own laptops I really don't even
the surface book I'm just not oh yeah
hold on one second one second one second
there are so many different Microsoft
laptops out there ah the surface book is
one that I've never really been
intriguing because I think it's
overpriced I think they give it up the
ones that you want like the beefy ones
like this one right here from Best Buy I
got this pulled up and I'm just gonna
read off the specs to you guys so this
is a surface book this is the one with
the detachable base I don't like by the
way how it's heavier on the screen that
is at the base so that means a laptop
kind of like it's a little flimsy it's a
little awkward I just don't like that I
don't like how it like folds over either
because there's like a gap if you like
you can just push the back end of it
with a hinge and it'll just snap or
something I just a weird kind of curve
but anyway we got one here this is a of
course Best Buy is gonna be super
friggin vague about their specs this has
a gtx 960 5em and until 6 Gen Core I
said well what am i reading here this
isn't even up to date
this isn't whatever okay this is this
whole thing fell apart anyway surface
books are typically overpriced I just
don't think that they're worth the
markup scrolling down what do you
recommend for attaining a major in
mechanical engineering this is from eyes
Isaiah Isaiah see I have a should you
consider engineering video on the
channel just do a quick youtube search
it's there for you and it will explain
pretty much what you need to know about
that ducts exist hey science studio I
messed up the installation of CPU cooler
and put it on the wrong way I'd show you
a picture but I can't send links it's my
see if you're gonna fry or does it not
matter I'd have to know what you mean by
wrong way did you like turn it sideways
or something is your fan pulling in air
from your graphics card what do you mean
by that you need to be more specific
if you check temps more than likely
you're gonna be okay Victor is 22 what's
going on my man I see you quite a bit
and thank you for the super chat hey
Greg what settings do you usually test
games for fps I have a 1080 TI 8700 K
and only get 100 FPS at 1080p and
overwatch that's a very strange
framerate I would suggest that you
monitor GPU and CPU usage because right
now I mean you got the best of the best
when it comes to gaming right now I get
a 1080i at best for GPU 87 okay best for
CPU or in terms of like a value I think
for money so yeah that's really low I
mean I get a higher config year than
eighty seven retain at ten seventy TI so
I know I know that you're shorting
yourself somewhere but check usage that
would be where I'd start and just see if
you're maxing out anywhere or if you're
being unrealized check your system usage
your system you know the system spec
allocation in the task manager and just
see what's going on it's a little fishy
another superjet here in my addressees
real quick this is from the greatness
thanks for the five dollar super chat a
two thousand dollar laptop with the 1070
max q i7 8700 h 512 in about two and IPS
1080 1444 Hertz from Best Buy
it's the msi gs70 sign of that laptop
like if I was going to spend that much
on on a laptop I would go with the razor
laptop instead I think it looks a lot
better I think it's gonna sleeker
profile although I do like the screen of
the new laptop so it's that's it that's
a tough one I mean $2,000 for anything
is it's a lot of money to invest I just
draw 1500 speaking of that on a mate
book X Pro which has a discrete graphics
card in it the MX 150 which isn't
powerful by any means but it'll it's
enough to run in a lower resolution
things like fortnight and even pub G and
that's paired with the KB leg our i7 I
forget the SKU number but you guys can
look it up 512 gig and that to 16 gigs
of ram got that beautiful edge to edge
display so I'll be interested to
actually get my hands on
finally after just watching reviews for
the longest time and review it for you
guys on the channel
okay I see Hawk 101 asks what headphone
do you recommend under 100 bucks without
the need for an amp yeah if you don't
need an amp I assume you're not gonna be
too picky about the audio quality you're
not gonna be liking your audio file by
any means you know the ones that are
just plug and play I would say some of
the best ones for the money are gonna be
the coarser has the HS 70's I like those
a lot HS 6ths 50s are still really good
they have good drivers in those I
wouldn't really venture far out of like
if you can find sun Heiser's for under
100 bucks
i haven't done my research but I really
like the Sennheiser design of the 58 X's
so if you can find something along those
lines that's a little cheaper but from a
reputable brand like Sennheiser then of
course that's where I would go but
gaming headsets a little tough right if
you want the dedicated mic in there yeah
the ones like the one I use is the HS 70
and that's I think under 100 bucks if
you don't want to spend that much you
can buy the HS 50 which sounds basically
the same but it's wired in and you
should still be fine shag shaggy says yo
Greg a longtime subscriber I appreciate
that shags it is still funny your square
head and look like Max Headroom thanks
bro appreciate that
Jeff 86 96 I wonder if I will still live
here when Captain Kirk is born
interesting you guys are really getting
getting weird in the chat 1066 gig for
249 after rebate now or should I wait
until a better deal like Cyber Monday or
black Fridays from Eric tah I'm on a
pretty tight budget I don't really care
when I buy it either well then if you
don't care when you buy it and just wait
that's what I would tell you I wait for
the prices to get the prices have
already come down a lot but I would wait
till they actually loved a lot of where
they should be which is not an MSRP they
should be slightly lower than that
and when I say MSRP I'm talking about
when they originally launched that's
kind of what the prices are now I need
to be lower than that okay yeah let's
see Robinson Joe says yeah man does
YouTube like to eat system resources it
might be just your browser so check
check what browser you're using it's
probably Chrome if you're using Chrome
then yeah you're gonna have a fun time
with that will is well messaging me no I
guess that was a really delayed sound
anyway you couldn't turn that down so
you guys don't hear any feedback okay
flour per says what's the best monitor
for 400 bucks that's 144 Hertz look
without searching on my own during the
live stream I would just do a simple
search on a site like new egg or a site
like Amazon and stick to name brands
like Acer LG Samsung a sous benq ones
that you've heard of that get great
reviews just narrow down the resolution
to what you want refresh rate to what
you want and then just pick the one
that's usually the cheapest that has the
best rating that's what I do
I reviewed plenty of 144 it's panels up
there so if you want to check it out
check those videos that you can but I
think for a live camera it's not worth
going through all that just for one
question so I would just narrow down the
results yourself and pick the 1s again
highest reviews for the lowest price
okay see get to Mon tailmon
got him on tailmon I didn't say that
right the youth market is still in
sticker shock around here can get new
for say more or less yeah I think a lot
of people are resistant right they have
all these like preset prices in their
minds and they don't want to back down
they don't want to accept the fact that
the new market has now leveled off quite
a bit it's it's lowered significantly
from where it was six months ago so yeah
I think there's some resilience in the
youth market to to balance out prices so
I would wait for that I mean I think
people are gonna realize that they can
buy new and if you use that as like you
know kind of like leverage if you see
somebody on Craigslist trying to sell a
1070 for 500 bucks and you show them a
new one on Amazon for 470 maybe you can
get it for 400 bucks you just you just
show them the link and say hey I can buy
this new for here I'll give you 400 for
it but if you're gonna still charge 500
I'll just buy it new
he could be stubborn and not give it to
you and that's fine it's his loss
because you can get one for cheaper
anyway and it's gonna be new but you
might be able to still squeeze out just
a $400 buy if that person is a little
more forgiving and willing to cope with
the fact that the market is no longer on
his or her side
so yeah just kind of feel out the seller
you'll get it let's see scrolling a drum
gamer asks have you ever played the soul
games if so which is your fave I never
have I feel weird saying that but I
never have I don't have time for many
games at all the link isn't really
played hard or like Grand Theft Auto
five Call of Duty series I play pub G a
lot and that's really about it I'm very
like once I start playing a game I get
locked into it and it's hard to switch
me to something new and that's why I
haven't touched fortnight really like I
use it a benchmark with it that's about
the extent of it
not only do I suck at fortnight because
I feel like it's just a cartoon by
comparison it's just I don't know I just
don't like the vibe of the game I don't
like having to switch and relearn
everything and the new like the building
techniques and stuff and fortnight or
like just make it a totally different
game and it's not something I'm learning
right now pop G is still popular and
that's what I'm gonna stick with because
I'm I'm resilient I'm that guy okay
scrolling up Christopher Ortega I don't
talk about politics
sorry that's one of the one of the
exceptions to the ask me anything I just
don't talk about stuff like that I think
it's irrelevant and people conflate
everything so it's kind of if Microsoft
and Google collaborate is from Gio
Sebastian if Microsoft and Google
collaborated do you think that they
could take down Apple in the PC
smartphone space no I really don't I
think people are gonna buy Apple because
Apple I think that Microsoft makes
quirky phones and I think oh why YouTube
is subtitling me live that's pretty cool
well Justin for me that we have
subtitles and that they actually work
that's super strange they're literally
audited I didn't know that was a thing I
didn't know you do live closed
captioning interesting I think we're
gonna go back to Twitter real quick
someone show these
some of the good stuff I see all these
questions in here and I'm I'm pretty
behind on that on these so here we go
we're gonna scroll down to we got oh
yeah here we go
okay the best camera for 1080p 60fps if
you want just 1080p 60 I mean one of the
some of the better cameras like the the
the Nikon select I might get my name's
all wrong here
they're not a Nikon excuse me I don't
know why I just said that Canon Canon is
better for video than Mike oh nice maybe
I can test it at first hand what am I
looking for is the 5d I feel like it's
the 5d Mark 4 I feel like that's the one
I was thinking of I'm pretty sure the 5d
Mark 4 doesn't have 4k capabilities I
know it does 4k video at 30fps oh well
there yeah what about the 60d is it a
60d I don't know much about Canon other
than the fact that they are better for
video yea the 60d are there like marks
to these I don't think so yeah this
clears something I need to research what
I use if that'll help you at all
I use a Sony a s7 too and I use a
Panasonic Lumix G 85 so the G 85 is kind
of like a dumbed down version of the g5
and that'll shoot 4k 30 the a7s2 will as
well but both are great 1080p 60
shooters so I would stick with Panasonic
for 1080p 60 maybe gonna use gh4 would
be pretty sweet for that cuz you get the
higher update rate clearly I know more
about Panasonic and Sony than I do Canon
but you might behind you might be able
to find some cheap 1080p 60 Canon
cameras out there and I would prefer
Canon / Nikon and I would probably put
them close to on par with Panasonic in
some respects Canon has a really sweet
autofocus system the dual pixels that
what they call it
so yeah that's something to consider
Rico Cruz good question Rico which
mechanical switch do you prefer for
gaming for gaming I prefer brown
switches blues - definitely feel better
than more tactile Reds feel like trash
I hate rinse and there's just like no
feedback I don't care
that it is just like the easiest it's
the least resistant or whatever you guys
are gonna say if you use red keys for
switch for gaming but I hate red so
Browns great middle ground
I still get tactile feedback enough you
know at least for what I do when I game
and I can still type with them too so
they're just an all-around good key but
every now and then I do go back to two
blues because I like the cooking of
blues cazador DeWolf he says drop out of
college for youtube with a question mark
I haven't dropped out of college I got I
already have an engineering degree and
I'm about to finish actually here in
October with my master's so you boy
getting these degrees he ain't using
them I don't know what's gonna happen
all I know is companies have good
benefits out there and YouTube gives me
nothing when it comes to benefits so
it's something that's wrongly swaying me
into the private sector is that Zil
dylan a--the Xylina i don't know if I
said that right my PC won't boot to
Windows after the logo just turns black
I switch the GPU then it works fine I've
tried everything I could and I
everything I could find online what's
going on and can I fix it you just said
you switched the GPU and then it worked
fine so that would be your graphics card
I don't know why that would be what it
would I don't know why it would show you
that but if you if you switch your
graphics card then that would tell me
that your graphics card now do you have
some weird software conflict that you
could try wiping windows and
reinstalling that probably do the trick
just cuz windows is really sketchy
sometimes but yeah I would check let's
see lmao a board
Rajini XD asks we have what's your
opinion on MX speed silver switches I've
never used them I have even heard of the
switches I just I usually stick with
brown reds and blues but I'll look those
up and see what other people say about
them and then try to get my hands on one
if I if I can because that sounds
interesting
speed silver switches all this see here
okay Erik day I just upgraded from a I
380 100 to an i7 8700 that's a big
upgrade Erik is there anything I could
do before or after installation or am I
good to go most of the time if you're
staying in the same processor family
it's not going to be an issue
to just stick with the you know the
driver updates that Windows does
automatically when you still have CPUs
the only time I'd recommend reinstalling
an OS typically what I try to do is
reinstall notice every time I build a PC
no matter what even if I'm transferring
drives between Intel and AMD systems if
you if you swap from Intel to AMD
definitely reinstall drivers are not
drivers reinstall windows completely
reinstall the OS because you're gonna
have so many driver conflicts are gonna
affect FPS or gonna affect performance
overall I can attest to this I'm sure
many others can as well especially if
you build multiple pcs and try using
reusing drives from an 80 102 and 8700
I'm pretty sure you're gonna be fine
there you're not gonna have any issues
in the long run when it comes to
performance because you're staying in
the same family with the same chipset I
assume you're not swapping motherboards
either so you should be ok ok scrolling
down I see we have a super check here
from stinky Pete oh 1 yo what's going on
ok someone he says how do you feel that
certain tech tuber seemingly Fanning the
flames of fanboys instead of remaining
neutral do you see a negative impact I
mean yeah I see it a lot and there are
youtubers out there tech tubers who I
know and I've talked to who I think do a
bit of that I think I think a lot of us
do it unintentionally sometimes I think
we try to remain unbiased but people
take our words out of context and make
it seem as though we are being biased
like I'm just gonna call it like I see
it and when I tell you that one product
is better than another it has nothing to
do with what that company tells me to
say it has nothing to do with how much
money they might pay me for a different
ad or whatever their money is never
gonna attribute to what I say about a
product if it is a comparison let's say
like if it's a genuine review then I'm
never first off gonna take money from a
company to say any especially anything
like that I'm not gonna say anything you
want me to say I'm gonna take the review
at face value and say ok this is my
experience with it here's how I see
things here's you know not letting facts
the graphs and we'll go on from there
but I think some people will take
something like I would buy the 2700 X
over the 8700 K for this scenario and
and extend that to like every scenario
right and say oh great favor is am deal
what you think is BS but I think people
look for that they look for those cues
just a fanboy behind because being a
fanboy is super popular there are a lot
of them out there so yeah okay scroll
them back up here we have a gtx 1080p is
c2 or for the win three that's a tough
one salvador i have more experience with
the sc2 model but i mean they're both
great i would just check reviews try to
check reviews from the same site so if
you're looking at new egg
check new eggs reviews for both cards
and just see which it's a little better
if anyone has weird finicky issues pick
the one that has a list of those most of
the time it can be fine with either of
these cards i wouldn't complain ebj
makes a great graphics cards sanjay
patel science studio would you consider
making a video about the whole process
of buying used or have you done this
Sanjay I have a video talking about how
to buy and sell use pcs on Craigslist
I'm sure YouTube didn't forward you that
video because they don't send a
notifications to literally anybody on
this channel anymore but if the video is
out there if you do a quick YouTube
search you'll find it and I kind of run
through like the steps right the the
ways to approach builds online that ever
used clearly they've been used before
how to haggle and and deal in person so
if that's what you're asking for that
video yes has already been uploaded to
the channel okay so you good questions
in the YouTube chat giving a couple
seconds here I'm gonna scroll through
some of the Twitter questions because
this is where I wanted a lot on the
funnel through mr. og gamer asked what a
2700 X bottle of 1080 in most cases no
absolutely not
it depends really on the game though so
if you are dropping all of your in-game
settings if you're playing in a low
resolution like 720p or 1080p with a
1080 then more than likely even if you
bump up a lot of those in game settings
in 1080p you're gonna have a CPU
bottleneck just because you're playing
at a lower resolution you're forcing
more frames because the GPU is no longer
a bottleneck this so you're always gonna
have a bottleneck that's something you
can't really get rid of you're not gonna
have a perfectly balanced system really
ever and every game is different but in
a general sense I would say that's a
perfectly legitimate combo 2700 X with a
1080 even at 8700 K with it
that's still a great balance system
another one here Brandon more asked have
you ever had an alpha cool reservoir get
microfractures near the threading no not
from alpha cool I had one reservoir for
quite a while from them I never had any
issues with that I did have some of the
old thermaltake reservoirs did split and
a lot of us have like plastic bases
Thermaltake components in general gonna
be a little cheaper and you're gonna
feel that not only with the product
itself but in the price so it's kind of
a trade-off but the old thermaltake
Pacific reservoirs
I think they were called Pacific
reservoirs those did have issues with
with splitting just because they had
cheaper plastic bases and the acrylic
was pretty thin but the newer ones like
the ones that's included in the M&amp;amp;M 360
kit that I kind of showcased that that
one's actually really sturdy holding up
very fine we'll see in six months how
it's holding up but supposedly they
haven't they've corrected that issue so
no not from alpha to alpha cools their
reservoirs as far as I know I've been
pretty good at least for me alright one
more from Martin Chris own Christian
interesting for the same price would you
choose an 8700 K based pre-built with
terrible Ram PSU motherboard and an ugly
case or a custom build 8600 K with
components of your choice depends on the
use case scenario if you're just gaming
any 600k is perfectly fine for that if
you're doing more than gaming I would go
with eg 700 K and eventually upgrade the
other stuff like the RAM power supply
and motherboard in an ugly case - that's
tough that's a tough one if you weigh
aesthetics more than that's fine
upgrading from 8600 KD 187 our case
shouldn't be too difficult at all and if
you can sell the 86 are okay and just
reinvest that money in 87 okay then
maybe it's more worth it to do that so
maybe play around in the used market
okay back to the YouTube chats let me
see you guys I am pulling up the good
stuff here
Oh righty I do have a question here from
as-as-as rail 2k8
I totally missed his $2 super chat I
apologize for that but he is asking in
Dutch so I'm gonna totally translate
this because I should know what it says
I know some of the words that he's
saying like
the coat is dying Doge mid mid
Louisville middle viola I don't know how
good is your German clearly not that
great shift is teaching me a lot but I
still even when I'm in Germany and I
actually am around people who always
speak the link like her family speaks
German everywhere they don't speak very
good English so I I just have to use
Lisa as a translator but I haven't
picked up as much as I should I should
be studying more I'm in the middle of my
classes right now so when those end I
should have more time to approach it
curly fry asked fractal design metruff
I'm adore a defined mid if you care more
about IR flow I think Meza Phi is a
better choice if you want more
versatility because the defined mid is a
bit it's a bit longer in terms of depth
you can fit an AI o without issues and
the mesh and the define C not because
you can kind of wedge fans upfront but
you're gonna choke off airflow in 90% of
cases I would say the metruff is better
by okay
scrolling down here I see the good stuff
or you guys it is okay Dave 3dfx ass is
60 to 65 seeing games good temps I don't
know if that's for your GPU or CPU Dave
but if it's for either one those are
perfectly fine times not a problem at
all
Jimmy 142 Schmidt asked how far can you
overclock arisin 3 1200 as far as I know
those will not hit for very very often
at all
I have a rising 3 1200 but I haven't
overclocked it anywhere near 4 I want to
say the highest I got mine too I think I
just kept it
excuse me at like 3 8 I want to say that
might be totally wrong I'm kind of I'm
trying to remember what I did with that
CP I think I used to stock cooler so I
did enough o'clock it very far but I
imagine you would you could approach for
and most rise in summit ridge CPUs you
can approach for Brian says I speak
German
he speaks German they used PC part ode
al I want to think that's the I think
that's the wrong language right that's
good stuff ok Salvador s does the 8200 K
run hot and what a crack a next AC to be
could cooler for it perfectly fine
cooler and it runs pretty hot because
the
this terrible thermal compound okay
let's see sorry Kelly says sorry I don't
speak kangaroo that's a rip on Brian
ouch okay Nate dog says hey science
studio I'm building a PC with a 1700 X
and I was going to choose a cooler from
the kraken series is it worth getting an
X 62 so the 1700 X is I have that CP
person I've used it quite a bit you can
overclock that one in most cases to 3.9
gigahertz I would say 90% of those SKUs
assuming you have a decent enough
motherboard for the overclock it's gonna
hit 3.9 no matter what 4 gigahertz it's
gonna be really tough you're gonna shove
a lot of voltage in the CPU anything
higher than that and it's gonna run
really hot so it definitely starts
falling apart at around 4 gigahertz 4
summit ridge CPUs the exicted 2 is
perfectly fine you can get by with a
smaller AI of the night you can cover
the X 42 they have what the m22 is like
the 120 milli I affirm in 60 so you can
go then even smaller than that I would
say the X 62 is just gonna run a little
quieter I would say excuse me okay
we have some more questions here from
Frank Fran x64 that's what kind of work
you have I'm kind of confused by that
question so I'm just gonna move on
Christian yeah do you want to do do you
want to do more laptop reviews
comparisons in the future Christian yes
I talked briefly a second ago about the
mate book X Pro I just ordered one and
I'll be reviewing that very soon the
laptop video is on the channel actually
do really well most of the time and I
don't know if that's just because it's
like it's something that gets shared a
lot or if it's just different content on
this channel so people tuned in because
they they just want to see it a
different take on a different product
and what they used to seeing on the
channel I'm not sure but they do well so
yeah I'm gonna keep those coming as long
as I can and I love reviewing mobile
tech like that I just that's how I
started getting a tech in the first
place anyway I was buying and selling
cell phones I was flipping phones all
the time in high school and I didn't
really make too much money from it but I
got to try out a ton of phones and I
loved mobile tecnine in that space
laptop same thing but they were so much
more expensive in high school without a
job I really couldn't
keep that up so you know cell phones Wes
okay Rico Cruz again which PC peripheral
Bren would you recommend for gaming it
doesn't matter I'm not going to name a
brand because they several brands make
it really great components I use all
kinds of different brands I got a bank
you mouse here I've it at coolermaster
keyboards I've got Corsair keyboards
I've got keyboards from companies I
can't even pronounce
I've got Razer headsets I've got course
their heads it all over the place
there's not one that I would just
recommend over anything and then shares
yeah
vertigo is our chair our chair of choice
and I should point out I've heard of
your hasn't paid us a single cent we
know we haven't taken any money from
vertigo I just have no problem promoting
them because I love their products I
think they make better gaming chairs and
a lot of the companies out there and
I've worked with quite a few gaming
chair companies you know whether you
like to run the game so on your game on
your resolution if you bump the
resolution your GTX entities gonna be
the bottleneck if you bump in game
settings your 1050 is gonna approach the
bottleneck you're always gonna have a
bottleneck and no matter what scenario
you have something in your system will
bottleneck the other and so you know if
you're gaming at a really low resolution
really low in game settings then the
8350 I imagine is gonna be a pretty
severe bottleneck so yeah it's a
trade-off definitely but in a general
sense that's not that's not too bad a
system although I would recommend
eventually upgrading that 8350 there's
some great rise in three value out there
you know there's a lot of even used
rising pcs that you can buy so try your
best will says thick will like the
verdict your SL 5000 oh yeah did they
send well they sent you that chair right
I'm pretty sure that that chair was a
was that the one that they sent you I
know they sent him one but I don't know
that was the SL 5000 I'm assuming it was
because he's talking about it but ya
know so I like the guys at berta gear
they're really cool to hang out with I'm
gonna met Chris again
he works at Verde gear and I got to talk
to him a lot of Computex so it was cool
to catch up and they're good people so
if I like you know the people that I
work with you know and it's just easy to
talk to you easy to get samples it's
just so much more
stress-free you know some companies will
want stipulation for stipulation after
stipulation and when you get a show here
we need this shown by this stable of law
but companies that just trust your
instincts right and that respects your
opinions when you when it comes to their
reviews regardless of whether or not
it's a positive or negative one those
are the companies I love working with
because they take the criticism to heart
and they usually re-implement those
improvements right even if it's not from
me if it's some other person's
suggestion or a whole forum dedicated to
a certain correction they want to see in
a future product implementation those
are the companies that are really cool
to work with and there are quite a few
of them that that I could name ok
scrolling up I see some more hit that I
missed Michael Capp Caballero asks what
is the stupidest mistake you've made
while building a PC I think most of you
guys who've been around the channel know
the answer to that question when I
thought that an NZXT Hugh blew up my
system when it was actually me using the
incorrect cable from a power supply that
was short-circuiting everything because
the wiring was all mismatched right so I
was supposed to have 5 volts down the 5
volt line but I have over 12 volts going
down to ground and ground where 5 volts
should be and it was just screwing
everything up and I genuinely thought
that that cable was the cable that went
to that power supply so not until I sent
in the power supply did I find out that
it was the wrong table so yeah that's
probably dumbest thing I've done just
because I thought that I had every
variable narrowed down but very clearly
I didn't it was just something that I
had overlooked and that was all on me so
that's why there's an apology video
that's still up on the channel by the
way I haven't deleted it it's still up
there talking about my mistake I made
with the heat plus and kind of like an
all-call for everyone else make sure you
don't cross cables from different power
supply manufacturers especially if they
fit in the same pin pin out you know it
doesn't mean that they're compatible
because pin outs on different power
supplies are different when it comes to
to modularity so something to consider
let's see here we have a feet are a few
super chats and we get to thank you dead
in red for the $2 stupid chat much
appreciated his question is a favorite
form factor to build i I like mid towers
so ATX is really
there's a lot of space usually you can
do a lot with ATX and I don't like to
supersize like EI TX full tower case is
typically very few that really catch my
eyes so if it's got seven PCIe slots and
it's not too tall it's not too wide but
it's it's just the right form thing you
guys know it's like around PCO 11
territory from Lee and Lee sv40 p400
territory from NZXT and fantex
that style case is my ideal form factor
and then one more here from Kelly Roman
thinking for the $2 super chat and it is
actually a shout out to another viewer
Co FASA Cabasa said hey saying thanks
for the help button so very cool you
guys are helping each other out I know I
can't get to every question but if you
guys know the answer to something you
feel like jumping in I do appreciate
that
I'm just a one-man show here for the
most part so any help down there is
again much appreciated what's going on
Krypton ik Krypton because one of our
moderators he is a loyal follower and do
appreciate very much what is the best
dish that you can cook and the best dish
that Lisa can cook a good question so
Lisa can cook she cooks a mean like
shrimp scampi type thing it's really
good I mean it's pretty like simple in
terms of what's in it but she just has
the right amount of flair she puts just
the perfect amount of ingredients in it
it's an Italian dish of course she is
that she is Italian despite being of
German nationality to her family's
Italian so she has many Italian dishes
in her head and her implementations of
them are great my favorite dish or the
best dish I can cook I can cook me New
York Strip you know don't get between me
and a steak I know how to cook it on how
to eat it and so yeah I would say steaks
I'm pretty good at hamburgers anything
on the grill with fire or charcoal you
know that kind of stuff I'm good with
that stuff especially outdoors my
favorite like professional dish I cook
mean salmon dish III definitely I worked
in a seafood market for a long time with
one of my local supermarkets here and so
I have a lot of experience cooking fish
preparing fish cutting fish and so I
like to kind of bring that to the
kitchen whenever I get a chance to cook
which is usually when Lisa leaves
because then nobody's here to
for me so then I got to be the one step
ups I like I haven't cooked very much
for Lisa but I do want to get just more
involved with that cuz she works really
hard and she doesn't just sit around the
household I mean she she works too I
mean she helps me a lot as well so she's
always really busy she's probably busier
than I am on many days uh more are hey
man I'm not here to ask any questions
I'm just going to say you are an amazing
youtuber I'm art you are an amazing fan
I appreciate it thank you for watching
you don't watch videos on a habitual
basis here on the channel I do
appreciate you stopping by in the
livestream especially on a Sunday night
on Monday morning unless a hard time for
a lot of people thank you guys for being
here
Samuel Sierra asked why do no tech
tubers make budget builds anymore we do
I mean we they're they're probably not
as often shown on the channel as you
might like but we have builds that suit
all kinds of price ranges I mean look at
Bryan Bryan was just here I'm not sure
if Bryan's still here but tech yes City
does literally use builds all the time
they're all budget oriented for the most
part so Bryan can hook you up for sure
I'm trying to plug his channel
specifically but you guys know like
there are channels out there that
emphasize budget builds and if you're
talking about like big tech tubers then
you know like I know Paul just recently
released some video where he kind of
runs through PC parts for a few builds
and he has an $800 bill that's actually
really good and it's because prices come
down a lot so something else to consider
there we're gonna be about here for
another five minutes or so so put in
your last round of questions and we will
be calling it soon so again jump jump to
jump to your questions throw them in the
chat I will do my best to answer them
there's one from home home d90 yes if I
prefer piyo vs cake
the answer is cake every time because
I'm a kid at heart I love case we have a
super chat here from Levon Castillo
donated to dela through the super chat
appreciate that is 1063 gigabyte worse
than an rx 588 gigabyte yeah if your
decision is between a 1063 gig and an rx
588 gig I would go with the Oryx 580 any
day if it's a 1066 gig and an rx 588 gig
for the same price I would choose the
1066 gig because I prefer the GeForce
software even though
the new stuff is kind of crappy I prefer
the old GeForce software but I love
shadowplay I love just the ease of use
when it comes to Nvidia products and
typically and that's just my go-to for
the things that are able but the 580 is
a slightly better card in certain
scenarios so if you play certain games
you know that cars can perform better in
the New York so everybody's a better
choice but in that particular case a
three gig 1060 just isn't gonna cut it
today
now the aurochs 588 gig is definitely
the better choice okay scrolling up here
- we have a few more is Liam G McCann
ass is a 10-7 ETI good mid-range card
1440p it is a perfect card 1440p I don't
think you'll be disappointed with a 10-7
TTI at all we have two running in our
systems here wanting a CH build they're
great and you can find them usually for
good prices as well okay I have let's
see what get rid of we have a super chat
here from what is this we have a super
chat from Michael Michael Caballero
what's going on Michael I think we just
answered a question from them I recently
watched a video where you drop test a
tempered glass panel would you consider
recreating experiment with a system
inside for more realistic scenario if
you maybe I might put just like trash
components in there stuff that I don't
care about anymore but then I feel like
it would just be like a disservice
because I could give that system away
and if I do break anything in the name
of science and it's just kind of wasted
product I'm not sure I think you can
imagine if a system fell off of a table
you know from three or four feet high
it's probably gonna have issues the
graphics card and the PCIe bracket might
break the CPU cooler might break there's
just so many things to worry about there
in a nightmare situation I might do it
but it's just tough to see a system like
that go to waste when it could be given
away or yeah just giving away or
recycled or what have you
okay we have a question from Jeff r86
nice is good one
Star Wars versus Star Trek I go with
Star Trek because I feel like a lot
people many people are gonna say Star
Wars the original Star Wars are great
but they've been stretching out this
series trying to milk all the cash
especially now with the new you know
change and ownership
I just I don't like the way it's
implemented so yeah Star Wars is kind of
a that's a dying breed in my book we
have a random tech stuff what do you
think about second to third gen
processors and motherboards I think
they're great I think adapt or good
price especially on an Intel is a little
harder to justify I think you can get
like as far back as the Ivy Bridge
though for for Intel and be perfectly
fine there Ivy Bridge Sandy Bridge even
has well you can find good deals out
there so just find something you think
is exceptional for the price and check
reviews and you'll be good to go we have
a question from Johnny a fart gas that's
a heck of a name do you like bananas I
guess I do you like bananas I do you
like that I feel like there's some
context in there than am I getting but
I'm gonna answer truthfully I do you
like bananas okay
nip what do you think is the dumbest
hardware that's had RGB added to it
PSU I think a power supply with RGB is
kind of stupid I'm not gonna lie I think
it's pretty pretty pretty dumb yeah okay
we have Paulie Vitali asks I've noticed
you haven't made a video on the z3 70's
or Tai Chi you usually like the Tai Chi
review soon I don't really talk to as
write very much I don't like their PR
department their marketing departments
pretty I just they're not fun to work
with they're not easy like they used to
be I used to have a rep that that worked
with with a with azrog who was very I
mean she was spot on all the time her
name was Oh Delia I don't know where she
is now I know she doesn't work there
anymore as far as I know or at least in
that department but they changed who we
talk to now and they're just so
different and in my opinion they're not
easy to work with so we don't do much
with ads work anymore they don't even
talk to me and I frankly don't care to
talk to them so unless they step up
their marketing PR game they're just
it's it's just not a vibe that I'm
feeling so if I buy as drunk it's gonna
be again out of my own pocket I'm not
gonna wait for them to decide to send me
stuff whatever whoo we have looking for
some good questions Lamborghini Civic
what do you drive I Drive an Infiniti
q60 red sport and was my dream car
probably a McLaren p1
the way those liquidly pretty slick net
seas rolling up okay what do you think
about the Andy rx 680 I have no idea
what that even is I have never looked
I've never if that's anything as a rumor
so I have no idea at this point we have
what monitor should I get 75 Hertz or
144 Hertz 144 is a huge step up from 75
I recommend getting a 144 if you can
assuming you have the hardware to push
those frames I'm gonna go through an
answer just a couple more Twitter
questions and I'm still going to address
the chat box here on YouTube so don't be
afraid to keep asking your questions I
am coming back so give me one second
here scrolling down scrolling down okay
this is a good one all right
we have is risin three and a gtx 1060
good enough to play most VR games at max
settings or near max settings no I
wouldn't say max settings know because
VR is gonna be more equivalent to like
even if it's 1080p VR which is I forget
what the HTC but I have an HTC vive and
I forget what the resolution is I'm
pretty sure it's like 1080p or 1440p but
you want a high refresh rate with those
those VR experiences because if you
don't if you have like 60 or 50 fps
you're gonna get headaches cuz your
brains gonna see like just a
frame-by-frame pass through when that
screens right up against your face it's
gonna be really tough to get around that
like that headache sensation that you'll
get kind of feels like you're in vertigo
so I would I would stress heavily
getting something better than a Rison 3
and a GTX 1060 as far as I know is a gtx
1060 vr is that like a vr ready card i
don't know if it is if it is then yeah
then the carts fine if it's not a vr
ready card i would take them at their
word that it's not a PR card i feel like
it is let me check real quick okay here
yeah it's me already
i should have known that so 1060 is fine
but the are the rise in three cpu I
would try my best to upgrade okay here
we go
a couple more mic frost asked ever wish
you had decided not to start a YouTube
channel no I don't I'm really happy with
what I've gotten this to at this point
what you guys have helped
I'll see grow this channel - at this
point you know the issues with YouTube
and all the crap we've had to deal with
over the years is totally worth it I
love doing this and I'll be sure to keep
it up as long as I can as long as those
channels around as long as you guys want
to watch videos this channel will be
here whether I go into the private
sector working or not which I could
certainly do and make a lot more money
doing this is a passion of mine I love
working with tech I love building pcs
communicating with all the companies
that we work with it's a really unique
experience not many people can say that
they can do it full-time and if I can
help it I'm gonna try to keep it up so
we have let's see Alex silver one more
will do one more YouTube question would
you ever consider attempting a dual
hardline system in a mid-tower I'm
probably not only there's enough space
in most mid towers for a dual hardline
system that's just my take on it
I'm just mmm yeah I'm not too sure
Skylar wall is singing for the $2 super
chat what's going on Skylar I 373 50k or
Rison 2,700 X vivre cool PSU or be quiet
I feel like you're trolling me because
if you if you've watched this channel
for a while you know the 73 50k is my go
to box opener so if you're just devoting
a response from me then there you go so
yeah the 27 X is no-brainer and deep
cool PSU or be quiet PSU be quiet PSU
99% the times gonna be a better PSU
it'll be more expensive sure but it's
gonna be much more reliable you'll have
peace of mind not having to worry about
this power supplies at all they run
super quiet and most of them now are
modular so if you're into that thing
then there you go another the straight
power eleven is fully modular for
example excuse me okay
scroll one up here did somebody just
reference let's see here we go yep
this is good stuff this is good stuff I
see
if you guys are gonna put like a bunch
of like emojis and stuff around your
comments I might address it once but I'm
not gonna keep going back because you're
putting emojis around your comments so
it's just something that I'm willing to
throw out there I see a few of you doing
that if you put random emojis hearts
whatever around your comments I'm not
going to read them just because you're
trying to make your comments stand out
from the rest and that's not fair to
everyone else and I don't want a chat
box filled with nothing but random heart
emojis so stop okay thank you I'm done
ranting we have what's going on mark
how's it going my dude hey Greg been a
fan not been a fan big fan from
Wisconsin what's going on man I my
parents used to live in Wisconsin and I
heard that it gets very cold in winter
I'm sure you can attest to that
firsthand
I'm sure that's news to nobody but I've
been at Wisconsin a few times we go to
it you have a six flags up there and it
starts with a double you walk Waukegan
or walk it Waukesha Brown remember the
city name it might actually be an
Illinois I'm not sure it's north of
Chicago and south of Milwaukee but we
used to go there all the time
we loved Six Flags okay must see the
good stuff hey Greg are you from
Louisiana that's Conor Buchanan's
question no I am from Florida I went to
school for three years in Louisiana so
that might be why you're thinking that
anyway now we get a bunch of party
emojis I knew this was gonna happen but
at least you guys aren't like try to get
my attention that way and to get your
question answered I appreciate the love
thank you guys we have a couple more
questions we're gonna get to and then
we're gonna call this one it's late
Sunday night early Sunday morning for
most people and you guys need to get to
bed you got work in the morning right
so do I even though I work from home
most of the time which is a privilege
and it's a curse in some ways we all
have stuff to do in the morning so well
in this one very soon we have let's see
Spencer I don't discuss the two things I
really don't like discussing on the
channel religion and politics because
those are two very heated topics so I
try my best you might find out my
political views you might find out if
I'm religious or not and if so what
denomination
or whatever but I'm not gonna
specifically address stuff like that on
science to do because I feel like that's
not the place for a channel like this to
make a position I just these insight too
much hate too many people are erratic
and just ridiculous sometimes especially
when it comes to politics and I'm not
about to I'm not about to swamp through
that mess so okay should I get a wise
e85 d-mint Garrett I have no idea what
it is I feel like I should but I have no
idea what otherwise e85 is what's going
on Andy thank you fallout super chat $2
New Zealand whatever that is in the US
doesn't matter appreciate it anyway and
when are beefy okay Brian Lee asked when
are be 450 motherboards coming out not
sure if I knew I still couldn't tell you
because it more than likely be under NDA
but it should be soon and you can take
soon to mean whatever you want
let's see some people are saying yes
early there 506 in the morning I assume
boss you live in Europe somewhere Oh
basically if you're seven hours ahead
which is seven hours from me then you're
in the German timezone so maybe Germany
Switzerland Italy area France or North
Africa not too sure but that would be my
my scope I would assume does 720p
monitor bottleneck graphics card most
likely not random tech most likely not
depends on the graphics card it's kind
of a big question
Alexandre Sauceda what is the most
interesting science in your opinion very
good question astronomy I think there's
so much we don't know about astronomy
physics which kind of wraps into
astronomy in a very unique way there's
so much we don't know about space and
what I mean we'll spend generations
discovering new things about that's
what's so cool like you know you can you
can only learn so much about certain
things right you can only learn so much
about an engine you can learn you can
only learn so much about how a CPU works
it doesn't matter how specific you get
there is a finite limit to that but with
astronomy I just don't feel like there
is a I feel like if we ever got to that
point by that point we would already
have access to all the information we'd
ever need anyway so I love just like the
idea of
not knowing much about a topic and just
kind of jumping in and being willing to
accept whatever comes your way and
that's what astronomy I feel like does
okay Clark Griswald or Al Bundy oh it's
a good question
let's see couple trolls in the chat I
see you I see you guys I'm not calling
you out nope
you ain't getting it okay jbt hey Greg
are you going to do a grand theft auto
meet up again or something like that I
found it a blast last time yeah sure I
think we'll do like a reunion meet up
maybe on GTA I would have to be a
certain night that many people would be
willing to get on so I imagine like a
Friday night or a Saturday night maybe
next week we can do a GTA about a GTA 5
livestream that would be pretty fun
actually and maybe maybe if not a
livestream will just record everything
and then I'll kind of chop it up so all
the good stuff is in the video so we'll
see that's a good question hmm and now
let's do one more question one more give
me the good stuff guys I'm gonna wait 10
15 seconds for you guys to hear this and
I'll see all the chats coming through
but give me a a good question just a
final question you want me to end with
and I'll try my best to find the one
worth addressing the most at least in my
own eyes save me one more I need the
good stuff I see a couple monitor
questions always go with the higher
refresh rate that's what I would say no
matter what go with a higher refresh
rate don't go anything larger than 27
inches in my book okay I see the good
stuff you guys are typing they're all
flooding in this is the good stuff
oh yeah this is good this is good oh
yeah Chris is down for gta5 is that
Krystal's I think I know who yeah this
is crystal that's cool I won't tell them
who you are Chris unless they already
know but that's really cool thanks for
stopping by in the chat we have some
good stuff here good stuff okay
CRT monitors in 2018 interesting Nick I
don't think there's much of a play I
mean yeah but like did you know just
there are advantages CRT when it comes
like input lag and stuff but I don't
think that they have a dominant place in
the market and it won't
King of Hearts asked air or dynamic I
think the dynamic is to the better case
I and I've I have both in the studio I
have yet to push out my air review it's
gonna take a while because I'm gonna do
some weird tests with it but I think the
dynamic is a better case all around
someone asked Rob med says a 1070 t I
too much for 1080p 60 Hertz laptop is it
good to future-proof if it's a laptop
I'm not sure are you talking about like
an external GPU if its internal then I
wouldn't buy them I wouldn't buy a
laptop with the 1080p 60 that's overkill
for that but if you're talking about
like an external GPU then a 1070 is fine
it's okay to future-proof and a 1070
already kind of is future-proof assuming
you're gonna stick with that resolution
and maybe a higher refresh rate maybe
1440p gaming you can still do that with
a 1070 okay okay I see the I see I see
you guys let's see one more real quick
interesting
Daniel Primus that's a really good
question there's a really
thought-provoking question we take years
to explain right master guys six three
five Greg ones the car update video
coming out very soon I'm just not people
were kind of finicky about car like they
see one car review on a channel like
this and they're like oh don't switch

channel anymore if you're gonna switch a
content like it's one car video like
just chillax people that's what I feel
like sayin just in the all chat but yeah
it's coming soon and we'll have fun with
it and might even include McLovin just
because I know you guys miss McLovin and
we've been talking we have we have some
things in the works so stay tuned for
that okay good stuff you guys
