posted a picture of my custom painted
NZXT Kraken X 62 he saw a white radiator
I said I painted it I guess you assumed
I used acrylic or plastic tip or
something I understand I mean that
that's what most people would use to
paint other components in the case but
because the radiator is designed
specifically to dissipate heat
I used engine enamel which is most of
the time it's a ceramic based engine
enamel so it's going to be rated for up
to 500 degrees Celsius of heat output on
whatever surface its coated on as stuff
is rated for engines that's why it's
called engine enamel so it's perfectly
safe to use in something like a computer
now the painting process itself is very
simple if you're up for the task I mean
it's not going to take you longer than
maybe an hour to to do this as long as
you let the paint dry properly in
between coats
you let with a nice clean finish you
also want to make sure that your
radiator is not dirty covered with dust
or dirt or anything like that before you
paint because any particle that's on the
radiator before you paint will be
trapped underneath that coat permanently
unless you try to dig it out in which
case you'll end up with a really nasty
scar on that finished product the
painting process
took me about 45 minutes I applied three
solid coats and then just apply to light
fourth coat over the areas where I
thought it wasn't as as white as I want
remember painting over a black surface
so you want to make sure that you're
applying thick enough coats to where you
don't have splotches of kind of a semi
gray area where that white isn't
completely covering the the black color
in the radiator something you want to
make sure that you do before you begin
painting of course is make sure that you
mask off any areas that you don't want
paint being applied that you don't want
paint permanently sticking there's going
to be very difficult to remove engine
enamel after the fact I've I've had to
use a they call a nail polish remover
acetone things like that to remove this
in the past it does work but only on
super smooth metallic surfaces and
something like this what do they call it
braided cable here these braided pipes
that run down to the water block gonna
be a lot more difficult to remove engine
enamel from that so what I did was take
just some old masking tape I also took
some some duct tape to cover the the
area closest to the radiator try to get
as far down that that tube as I could in
order to minimize the amount of
overspray onto
onto that tube leading to the waterblock
and I still ended up with a partially
painted tube at the very base of where
it connects to the radiator I expected
that I did try to take a knife and just
kind of scrape away that upper layer of
engine enamel that stuck to it it looks
decent so from about a foot or two away
you can't really tell that I over
sprayed this is just something that you
can't really get away from because the
tube is flexible so whenever you mask
the tape off at that base that tubes can
end up being pulled to one side of the
other because the water block is
attached to it so when that tube kind of
leans one direction it's going to expose
an area that was previously covered by
tape and that's where the paint over
sprays its I mean there's probably
better ways to do it than how I did it I
just I just wanted to get it out of the
way quickly without creating a big mess
also be sure that you're doing this in
an area that's conducive to proper paint
drying if you are in an area where it's
fairly hot or humid you might want to do
this inside in a closed-off masked area
I don't have anything fancy like that
nor the space frankly in this apartment
so I did it on my balcony but it's
November here and I live in the northern
hemisphere which means winter is fastly
approaching it's about time it's been
fairly hot recently and it's kind of
strange but uh yeah it's getting cool
now so it was a decent climate for
proper paint drawing and that's
something you want to be wary of if it's
fairly humid outside and then hot do the
paint's not going to dry quick enough
and at the same time you get a lot of
water just moisture trapped underneath
layers of paint I can prevent the paint
from settling into that glossy finish
which is what this is you can buy engine
enamel in a matte finish or a gloss
finish I wanted this to be glossy
because it makes it look more italic and
it blends in with the with the rest of
the components in Heisenberg please be
sure that whatever you're painting is
dry by the way before you touch it
because if you do touch it and it's not
dried you're to end up with some ugly
fingerprints to stamp into the paint and
that's how it's going to dry from now on
and don't waste your time trying to
smooth that out that's just a lost cause
at that point you might want to just
either try to remove the paint all
together and start from scratch or just
keep applying coats until that
fingerprint or fingerprints go away so
make sure that it's dry I recommend
anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes per coat
I don't know what it says on here how
long the wait but
I don't I don't think you should expect
to wait any longer than that if your
climate is suitable for the painting but
it's rather hard I would push that to
maybe an hour just because the paint's
going to drive it slower where it's more
humid and just warmer in general and the
finished product I'm honestly very happy
with it there is one area of overspray I
just I sprayed a little too much in one
spot and the paint started to run down
and then kind of blotch it up right
there it's a bit thicker than the areas
around it but for the most part
everything's very smooth the finish
applied nicely and I'm glad I went with
the gloss instead of the mat for this
radiator now if you're interested in
temperatures here you go this also tell
you how how efficient the X 62 is at
cooling a CPU so our hottest core under
i-264 for 10 minutes with it 5820k i7
o'clock to four point five gigahertz
with seventy-two degrees Celsius and the
line underneath that another look fairly
similar
that was after painting the X 60 to
check that out one degree difference 73
is actually the same core - they got
that one degree otter so that's it so
from 72 to 73 degrees Celsius I'm saying
that that's probably within the margin
of error
this is 100% safe to use on pretty much
anything you can use on on any heat sink
any radiator without cutting into your
core temperatures too much without
causing this thermals to increase by any
substantial amount so yeah you can paint
a radiator and be okay with it I am very
happy with the X 62 in general as well
it's a great cooler I haven't noticed to
be honest a big difference between the x
60 ones ability to cool a CPU and this
one they appear to be about the same and
I'm not sure about the pumps inside of
both or you know whether they changed
anything like that and honestly the X 60
the first ncht kraken AIO was about the
same as both of those two so ruin the
improvements there aren't that
substantial but there aren't many
improvements to be made is this is about
as good as you can get for a 280
millimeter AIO
and you can find it I don't know when
it's going to be available I'm pretty
sure it's been released but it's hard to
find them I will have a link to the
Amazon and Newegg sites that are selling
this particular unit here that's not
painted in white but that you can get in
black and paint whatever color you want
if you wish in this video's description
