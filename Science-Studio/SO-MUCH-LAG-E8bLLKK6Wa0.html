laptop struggle I must say there are a
few things I am very impressed with in a
few things I have been let down by over
the course of just one day with this
computer one of the things that I do
enjoy about this computer is the fact
that there are two USB ports not just
one so coming from the Acer 110 to this
computer it was nice to be able to
utilize two USB ports I would not be
able to hook up for one this blue
microphone here and a nice cheap it's
not really nice at all it's just a cheap
Mouse to be able to you know navigate
quicker versus using this little
touchpad right here so it's nice to have
those two I didn't think that that would
come in as handy as it did but given my
current situation that is nice to have
two of those USB ports I didn't bother
downloading steam for the for two
reasons actually the first reason is
because I don't have enough storage to
probably even download a single game
from Steam I think I have the most five
gigabytes left let's see over here I
have six well six-and-a-half gigs of
available storage and I know there are
some games that I could download from
Steam that would that wouldn't take up
all that space but I'm just going to end
up deleting them anyway and I wouldn't
recommend even downloading Steam on this
device because this is not meant to game
so don't buy this thing for strictly for
gaming but I will show you that you can
get by with certain certain games
minecraft is obviously the one that that
comes to mind at least for me so find
the application here so like I said in
the first first video of this laptop
here about 30 to 40 FPS while you're on
the surface roaming around doing
whatever obviously when you start you
know blowing up blocks or planting a lot
of stuff or maybe using a shovel and
taking up a lot of dirt or something
some weird like that then you're going
to start seeing those dips in FPS and I
did run fraps and I even tried to record
a few times and it was it was decent for
the most part I would say one thing I
like to do when I play Minecraft and any
machine is perform the TNT detonation
test so I'll take a single block of TNT
and detonate it and then a three by
three by three block of TNT and detonate
it and then a five by five by five block
of TNT and detonate it and see how that
affects performance particularly the
frames per second that you're receiving
in mind
itself and this computer did not do well
at all even a single block of TNT pretty
much dropped these for the
frames-per-second counter to zero in
fraps it would it lagged for a long time
so if you plan on exploding anything in
Minecraft don't
you
in all honesty though you could play
this game just fine on this computer if
that's all you are expecting to do is
play minecraft something office theme
would be a lot more difficult to have
for one just download alone to find
enough storage to store the game itself
but then also to run integrated HD
graphics not ideal for any of that at
all and I mentioned that the first video
as well another thing I want to show you
has to do with CPU synthetic so you know
I like to run Siddha bench and geek
bench and all those things and I did
touch on those scores in the original
video for this laptop but another thing
I wanted to do was run I 264 and
essentially what this is going to do is
stress our CPU pretty much to its limit
and we can get an idea for how hot this
computer gets I would like to point out
first and foremost that there is a
section of this computer that gets
fairly hot much hotter than the other
sections of the computer and it's up
here in the upper left hand corner
underneath the WASD directional keypad
area I believe that the CPU is located
directly under here it does it very hot
even though this entire computer is
passively cooled so you don't have to
worry about hearing anything when it
gets loud but the fact that it is
passively cool does cut into the
computer's ability to dissipate heat and
that's what you notice when this
computer is playing games like minecraft
or doing some pretty intensive CPU tasks
like I was doing a couple days ago and I
was the video editing with this thing
even moviemaker is very taxing on this
machine we are going to stress each core
and we're going to see how hot things
get so currently right now now keep in
mind that I am running audacity at the
moment with this microphone so that's
already running on the background and
our CPU temperatures are currently at
around 42 to 43 degrees and you can
actually feel that heat kind of moving
making its way through the keyboard at
least but I am going to turn that on
right now and give you guys an idea for
how hot this thing will get under full
load so I'll go ahead and click start
and our CPU usage is at 100% I also want
to see if this thing thermal throttles
at all I'll be interested to see how hot
this thing gets and then at what point
the CPU begins to throttle its overall
frequency so
that'll be interesting okay so actually
this is very surprising or if we've just
been under about two or three minutes
worth of load actually we haven't even
gotten two minutes yet but things have
definitely already beyond a level off
I think our highest CPU core temperature
is 53 degrees which is not a big
difference at all from the 43 degrees
that we were achieving just kind of
under idle again with the exception of
audacity running in the background with
this microphone so no telling how much
stress this is putting on it alone I
will be interested to find that out as
well other than that the gameplay and
CPU synthetics are there their par
they're on par with what I would expect
for a laptop like this but where things
are definitely going to start to change
I already know this from experience as
when you start video editing photo
editing music editing all of those kinds
of things anything with editing at the
end of it will be very very difficult
for this computer to handle and that's
what I'm going to cover in the second
vlog regarding this laptop and my
ability to use it to upload videos to
the channel for you guys all to see so
thanks for sticking around I will post
further updates and I will let you know
if this thing is getting on my nerves
yet not yet but it's probably it's gonna
it's gonna happen it's gonna happen
this is science studio everyone thanks
for learning with this
