deal that appears too good to be true
but often times it is I was scammed out
of a gtx 1070 listed for a whopping 99
US dollars but i mean come on that
should be expected right it was more or
less an experiment for me and i have a
detailed in this video right here but
today I want to discuss scammer
strategies in general as they relate to
graphics cards and how to spot them with
the market hot there are plenty of
potential buyers to be fooled
the first thing that always catches my
eye on a site like eBay is a sweet deal
but lately I've noticed prices dipping
into uncharted territory for specific
cards namely the GTX 1050 if you haven't
ready seen these videos from other
channels suppose a 1050 scam involves
the flashing of some older card
essentially fooling the operating system
at least on a software level to
recognize the card as a 1050 when in
fact most of the time on the hardware
side the card is something much older
usually a 550 or 650 Ti massive
performance gap there but the problem
associated with clicking an ad like this
is that you're bombarded with
conflicting information check it out the
seller has an excellent feedback at
98.7%
they're offering 60-day returns and 100%
buyer satisfaction you're even backed by
the e-bay purchase guarantee which I
mean shouldn't be surprising but still
so you feel confident but if you follow
through with a bit of due diligence
before purchasing you'd notice the card
has a few odd traits first off there is
no branding on the card it simply
marketed as a generic gtx 1050 it even
says that the brand of this card is
quote unbranded / a generic first red
flag second certain physical attributes
of this card don't line up on paper for
instance there is no GTX and 50 of which
I've ever heard
boasting a VGA port it's also listed as
a 115 watt TDP card though a simple
search on Nvidia's website confirms that
the reference model is rated at 75 watts
this shouldn't be higher unless the card
in question uses a custom PCB at which
point you'd be paying a premium not
receiving a huge a discount doesn't
matter much anyway for the 1050 this TDP
is wrong another point in this category
the GTX 1050 s maximum display
resolution is 76 80 by 43 20 whereas the
Sat acknowledges a max res of 2048 by
1024 you can also cross check things
like core memory frequencies power
connections and bandwidth to either
confirm or deny your suspicions the good
thing here is that the seller is being
honest at least with the specifications
just not the card as a whole but if none
of these quality strike you as odd - be
sure to at least scroll down to the item
descriptions where things get pretty
funny and where our seller in particular
left us a very lovely note quote this is
a customized version not original the
pursuit is the cost performance although
the interface and
performance have changed it can meet
most of the usage requirements in
reality I don't even really know what to
say this sounds as though it's been
written by the same person always
selling fake Rolexes in Manhattan this
is your final swing if you missed this
one you're in for a huge scam strike
three in you're out but let's say you do
fall for the scam where you purposefully
buy into this just to see what will
happen what should you do next in my
case I was stuck waiting for several
weeks before receiving a refund the
account was flagged is compromised and
restored soon after the original owner
and it turns out the card never really
existed in the first place what you
should do that when a case like this is
wait for the card to arrive
inspect it take it apart if you have to
take a photo of the GPU under the shroud
and heatsink this is something that they
won't change rights this will prove if
they falsely advertised this product and
then file a claim with eBay now since
you've got buyer's protection you should
hear something back soon select the item
was not as advertised button and fill in
the comment box with exactly what
happened and hey you have a photo now
for proof of false advertising more than
likely you'll be refunded your money
after a short waiting period but even
better you'll usually get to keep the
card too so the joke's actually on the
seller in this case call the bluff pay
upfront file a claim a profit that's
what many do at least know if you're
interested in trying that let me know
what happens in the comments section
below I don't need a 550 ti so I'm not
gonna bother going through this thing
again I'm simply pointing out the
loophole here another thing you can do
and keep an eye out for that I didn't
mention earlier was the seller location
if the graphics cards coming from a
place like Hong Kong be very very
careful not because of the Asian selling
the graphics card more than likely but
because these scams do often originate
from China it's just a fact that's how
it is so I suggest clicking on the
sellers profile first and reading
negative reviews before closing an order
like this it's best to prepare mentally
for what may occur in the future by the
way make sure you always pay through
eBay with a verified account and that
you always use a site like PayPal to
send and receive money never navigate to
a third-party site from an eBay ad and
pay through their service because if you
thought receiving the wrong graphics
card was bad wait until you see what
they do with your credit card by the way
if you liked this video let me know by
give us one a thumbs up I appreciate a
thumbs down for the opposite keep a
lookout there folks for those
scammers they're all over the place
especially now on the graphics card
Department stay tuned for more videos
like this one this is science studio
