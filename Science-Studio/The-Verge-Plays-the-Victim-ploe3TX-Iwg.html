not for Kyle it appears his issues been
resolved although these tweets would
suggest YouTube was the one overturning
the copyright strike and the verge and
Vox media are taking credit for the
restoration sounds almost like a sick
joke right
so a few others have already made
response videos to this garbage I'm not
gonna do this same thing in the case of
like just addressing the whole issue I
want to talk specifically about the
garbage that is this article in my
opinion I invite you to watch Paul's
video specifically regarding the
severity of copyright strikes and why
it's such a big deal for channels like
mine and his and Kyle's but yeah I'm
gonna tear this what I would regard as
pathetic article released by the verge
apart it was released earlier this
morning and I think it's just made
things worse for them if you don't want
to hear me read it over or if you've
already read it yourself you can skip
ahead to this time stamp otherwise
buckle them seat belts
you
address a situation around some YouTube
copyright strikes since retracted issued
by the verge and Vox media that has
gotten pretty toxic and could have been
avoided if the parties involved had
simply reached out to me directly early
this week a number of YouTube reaction
videos were flagged to Vox media's legal
team who are very diligent and
protective of our work
two of them were reactions to a PC build
video we had made several months ago
which I determined did not meet our
standards and had pulled from YouTube
those two reaction videos use 90 percent
of our footage without any edits cuts or
otherwise transformative use and one of
them in particular featured what our
legal team felt was a pretty racist
character our legal team felt this was
not fair use and issued a copyright
strike request YouTube for those two
videos another of other very critical
videos were not responded to in any way
one of those was ours by the way
YouTube's notified the two channels in
question said there was a chance our
request couldn't make it through and
asked our legal team for their case our
team made the case YouTube agreed the
videos were not fair use and issued the
strikes when this was brought to my
attention a few hours later I told them
that although I fully agreed with their
legal argument I did not think we should
use copyright strikes against legitimate
channels even if we thought the videos
crossed the line and again and I fully
agree with our legal team these videos
crossed the line of fair use at my
direction the strikes were retracted so
now Nilla is the champion right and he
successfully snuffed the flames I'm
assuming his name is pronounced Neely
I've never heard his name said any more
so I'm just gonna go with that one we
should all be cheering for this guy
right but what about this response from
YouTube to Vox media that Kyle so
graciously revealed to us on Twitter hi
the verge we are very concerned that
your copyright notification may not be
valid for some or all of the videos
identified in your notification doesn't
sound to me like YouTube was in contact
with the company prior to the female
despite the time stamps Kyle lives in
California and box media is on the East
Coast so if we assume delay lives there
his timeline
seems legit if we assume he was in or
around New York I'm missing
but something still seems fishy here
because at this point Kyle's video was
already a restored and then there's the
mismatched YouTube agree the videos were
not fair use and issue the strikes am i
reading this section of the article
wrong like maybe that's the name of the
case but it's a seam right here that
YouTube was siding with the verge and
then there's the inconsistency with the
way nil I presented the initial inquiry
the legal team decided to it's basically
dig up dirt on these videos from nearly
four months ago an issue strikes now in
my opinion this entire section is in the
lay blaming his legal team for
overstepping and issuing strikes when
they quote should have done something
less severe it's not a literal quote but
that's essentially what he's saying
right here and from my point of view
they could have done anything at all
legally they just have to kind of roll
with it they published a video falls
under fair use you can comment on it
critique it you can even turn it into a
parody and that's well within your right
as a content creator I mean comedy shows
do this all the time on TV but look
there a ton like look at film film
theories if I watch them every now and
then film theories has a basically an
entire set of just showing clips of
movies and commenting over them that
kind of stuff would not be allowed if
the verge or companies like the verge
were able to do what they tried to do to
Kyle so whatever let's assume that nila
is correct let's assume he issued the
retraction whether in face of
overwhelming public resentment or not I
really don't care
let's assume it was it no sorry I've
been reading too much of that article
I'm allergic to it okay again let's
assume he acted in good faith I still
have a huge problem with the way he
presented himself and his company in
this article starting with this chunk of
words here and it could have been
avoided if the parties involved had
simply reached out to me directly look I
don't know if this dude was hiding under
a rock but he likely received dozens of
pings on Twitter from other public
figures I mean even if you disable
notifications from people you don't
follow people with ten followers or
whatever just you know random people
that follow you
you still see notifications from those
who are verified or have large
followings it's not always the case but
it happens to me all the time so he
probably saw some of these right and we
could assume you saw some of these but
chose not to address them on Twitter as
he says here one thing I did not do was
tweet about it because I
think the nuance of this situation would
lend itself to tweets and also quite
honestly because I didn't think it was
that big a deal okay but so it's no big
deal that your parent company issued a
falsified copyright strike against a
reputable technology channel nothing
wrong with that whatsoever it sounds
stupid just saying or reading back in a
script my biggest issue with this entire
thing is that la makes himself look like
the hero here in my eyes at least yet
100% acknowledges the fact that he
didn't think it was a big deal that
Kyle's channel was hit with a copyright
strike over this to begin with
so as an insane degree of public
backlash hit your company did you then
feel as though a strike was overboard
and then there's a pathetic attempt to
play victim
oh we're receiving death threats give me
a break
they're seriously calling this a death
threat maybe the death to your website
sure but nothing physically threatening
you shouldn't be in fear for your life
in this case I think anyone with eyes
can see that that's what this guide
meant and I love how they only managed
to point out this single comment if it
was so prevalent which they suggest by
use of the word brigaded mind you why
would you only plaster this one was this
the worst you could find show me a
legitimate death threat and we'll both
agree that it's wrong and should be
investigated I don't mess around with
that crap that's serious stuff but this
you know what he's referring to I mean
come on all this looks like to me is a
sad attempt to convince viewers and
readers that they should feel bad for
you you should feel ashamed and then
there's the blame game the lay thinks
this is Kyle's fault because he didn't
contact Annaleigh directly this is I
mean this is that the idea you get from
the sentence this is all pretty
disappointing especially since I had
retracted the strikes and none of the
people involved thought it important to
simply ask me about it dude such a weak
response you represent your company all
the actions your company takes take
ownership of this Kyle specifically tag
Vox media and the virgin his initial
announcement that this parody video had
been pulled and that his channel had
been hit with a strike you're the
editor-in-chief and the co-founder of
The Verge how the hell do you not notice
the thousands of tweets directed at your
company including Kyle's whether you
love it or hate it Twitter is a modern
form of communication you acknowledge it
by having an account with thousands of
followers and
thousands of followers yet you don't
regard the direct tweeting as a
legitimate attempt to get in contact
with you or your company if you guys
were so concerned about it uh begin with
why should you expect how to take the
first step why didn't you
message Kyle first with your intentions
why didn't you maybe Kyle would have
worked with you but she didn't you gave
him a strike instead I don't care if you
did it in LA or if your legal team did
it it's your company that did it so yeah
how about you take the first step your
company issued the strikes this was your
overstep and you're gonna blame Kyle for
not sending you a personal email what a
friggin joke honestly I mean this whole
thing just became so much worse for them
all of this was behind us already I mean
some of us made a single video regarding
how poorly put together that initial
video was I did mine right here mine
wasn't striped but it could have been
based on their own interpretation of
fair use and that's why I'm so pissed
off here but that was it one video maybe
a reference or two arises here and there
in the future but it was behind us and
now thanks to your own doing we're all
reminded of it ok now I'm talking to the
general audience most of what I've said
in this video is my opinion my
interpretation of the facts and claims
presented I'm gonna disclose that
because I don't want to get sued for
some stupid reason and I don't want to
be striped I mean I literally referenced
almost their entire article in this
video so by their definition I suppose
this video could be strike two who knows
I don't really care they need a man up
they need to take responsibility not
blame the true victims of this story we
all make mistakes like I blew up two
power supplies and a motherboard
thinking and ZX tu+ was a fault but you
know what immediately after I found out
that it was my own ignorance at fault I
sat in front of the camera apologized at
the audience and more specifically to
NZXT and deleted the previous videos
containing my false accusation it
doesn't fix everything it's not supposed
to it doesn't make the damage disappear
the the negative PR disappear but it's a
freakin start and today I'm happy to say
that NZXT was cool enough to not
ostracize me I just recently worked with
them they sent an H 504 review it's the
best I could do at the time right a
public apology taking down the BS the
stuff it's not true and then just
allowing time itself to play out things
heal but I've got a good feeling that
the damage the verge is done to itself
now won't heal anytime soon so with that
said I implore you guys to remain civil
do not threaten these companies you'll
only create trouble for yourselves
instead speak your mind in this
comments-section let me know how you
feel about this entire incident whether
you agree with me or not
no fancy conclusion here this is science
video thanks for watching and thanks for
learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
