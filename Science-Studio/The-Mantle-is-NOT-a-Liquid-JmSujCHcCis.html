people would think that the mantle is
liquid what we know about the structure
of our planet we all know this from
geophysics we know this from geophysical
investigations for the most part we're
talking about seismic waves so what
happens when we have an earthquake it
sets off an immense amount of seismic
energy and that seismic energy travels
to our entire planet those are very
strong seismic waves and the two
principal types of waves one are
compressional waves they compress and
expand compress and expand the material
just like the sound waves do and the
second type of waves are shear waves
they move perpendicular to the wave
movement and they have a shear movement
and so these two principle type of waves
are set off by any earthquake and some
of them are humongous and so let's
assume we have an earthquake that wave
travels through the entire planet and
arrives anywhere on on the planet now if
we have an earth that is homogeneous
that has no layered structure inside
those waves would come through and would
come through and would come through and
you would have an arrival of waves all
over the sphere that's not what's
happening what's happening is those
waves are refracted and reflected at
different surfaces within within
the compressional waves we call them
also the the P waves the primary waves
they travel really fast about twice the
speed it will test the shear waves and
they travel to any medium they travel
through liquids to solids and through
gases and so they arrive anywhere the
shear waves
you cannot cheer a liquid you cannot see
a liquid what that means is the shear
waves once they hit a liquid they do not
propagate liquids the shear wave is a
force like that and when you do this to
water or to any other liquid or to air
you can achieve it okay so the velocity
of shear waves in any liquids is zero so
they just simply get absorbed and so
when waves travel through our planet if
you look at cheer waves the S waves that
move this way they do not arrive at the
opposite end of an earthquake so there
is a liquid down there we know that okay
so they travel down and they get
absorbed but the neighboring wave they
make it so some of the shear waves they
make it like this and they arrive here
and they arrive at a 103 degree angle
away from the origin of that wave okay
from that we can calculate the distance
to that to that sphere inside that's
liquid we know there is a liquid sphere
inside and that's our outer core okay
and we can we can make easy calculations
that's about two thousand nine hundred
kilometers down from from where we are
okay so that's where the manticore
boundary is okay so that's where that is
what also happens is the S waves they
travel through that entire mantle
okay so from that we know that the
mantle is solid because else they would
not travel through that okay
we also know that the inner part of our
core is a solid because we get S waves
that travel through the inner part of
our core and that's amazing because they
get first absorbed and then they show
back up and that's because the P waves
travel through it and when a P wave P
wave hits a physical boundary they is
called wave conversion some of the P
wave energy is transmitted into an S
wave again okay so basically from from
looking at hundreds and thousands of
earthquakes we know exactly the
structure of our planet we know the
velocity with which waves travel through
the different layers of our crust and of
our mantle and of our core and we not
only do we have seismic energy that
totally proves that there is no liquid
in the mantle but we also have samples
of the mantle samples of the mantle and
here is one this is called a mantle
peridotite it consists of magnesium iron
silicate and it's very heavy material
okay and the seismic velocity of this
material coincides with with what we
know from earthquake energy
and these samples they're not really all
that rare because volcanoes bring them
up from the mantle all the time so this
is sort of undigested mantle that hasn't
been melted in in volcanoes okay so we
have samples of it and it's crystalline
it has large crystals in it which means
it cooled very very slowly and this is a
result of the initial differentiation of
our planet in the early days of our
planet like 4.6 to 4.5 4.3 billion years
ago a differentiation was the first
process that it happened by
gravitational forces that really heavy
material the nickel and iron gravitated
towards the center of the planet and
then lighter layers like the mantle
makes up the next big shell and then we
have on the very top very thin the
lightest materials of all and that is
the crust okay and here's a part of the
crust of the Earth's crust as typical
typical composition of a granite okay so
that's that's how that looks like of
course we don't have a sample of the
liquid of the liquid core or of the
solid part of the core but we have
materials that are sort of an analogue
to that and those are meteorites these
are nickel iron meteorites and these
meteorites
they have about that composition and
they are and so all these lead us to to
knowing that the core is made out of
nickel iron and so there is no doubt the
mantle is solid and there is no doubt
that we know what it is we do have
samples and we do know from the seismic
wave propagation of s waves that they
travel through it with the speed that
they should travel through it and so all
this there is no dispute about it the
the mantle itself the earth is extremely
hot okay so the earth is extremely hot
and we know that the plates are moving
plate tectonics plates are moving and
they're moving by heat convection very
slowly with about let's say you know an
inch to two to three inches per year
that's about the most motion it's like a
boiling soup very slowly falling soup
and so it's basically a big huge
convection cell and so there is some
plastic movement in it because of the
and that heat comes from radioactive
decay of uranium thorium not very
long-lived radioactive elements the
short-lived ones have have ceased to
exist for a long time now but we have a
huge amount of heat left and heat is
really what drives our planet heat is
what drives our drives everything
without that radioactive decay we
wouldn't have the magnetic fields we
wouldn't have to state tectonics we
probably wouldn't have an atmosphere to
live in I got my PhD in Germany I
graduated from one of the oldest
universities not only in Germany but in
the world University of Tuebingen and
from there I had a postdoc appointment
at the University of Michigan I stayed
there for three years doing basic
research fundamental research actually
in the magnetic field and then I worked
for nine years at the ocean drilling
program at Texas A&amp;amp;M University
before I came here and I've been here at
ul for thirteen years none professor of
geology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
