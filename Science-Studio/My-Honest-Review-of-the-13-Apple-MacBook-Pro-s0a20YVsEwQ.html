this video description for 10% off your
first purchase every once in a while I
have to review something controversial
on this channel there's one way to get
the comments exploding down below it's
an Apple product Apple has a stigma for
charging more than its competitors for
an equally SPECT product this example
here is no exception I've been using the
Dell XPS 13 this is the fully loaded
model right here costing about fifteen
hundred dollars for about six months now
and I'm very satisfied with it but
something told me that I needed to go
out and purchase a MacBook Pro now this
is the base model here I still ended up
paying about twelve hundred and fifty
dollars after-tax so not too far off
from this laptop here this one is SPECT
much higher than this one although i5
and i7 ultra-low power processors really
don't differ much in terms of
performance so in this video while
stepping on many of your toes I imagine
I'll be giving you my honest impressions
of the MacBook Pro 13-inch 2017 model
here we go
so my impressions out of the box this is
without a doubt the best built ultra
book on the market period cannot take
that away from Apple the solid aluminum
body is pristine and the edges are very
fine part of the reason why people are
willing to pay the Apple tax because
these products are built so well I can
attest to it only in this case but also
in the $2,000 Apple experiment case
where I purchased two grand worth of
Apple products at one MacBook 12 inch
and iPhone se which was later upgraded
to an iPhone 7 and an Apple sport watch
I had never gone full Apple before not
only was the ecosystem great but the
build quality and all the products that
I purchased was top-notch
ok ok Greg we get it Apple products are
built well so what there are two huge
drawbacks when choosing a macbook pro
over a Dell XPS 13 for example the first
is the limited i/o so two USB type-c
ports on the far left you can charge an
either one of those but that's all you
got so yeah be prepared to bring some
dongles the other huge drawback at least
for some people is the operating system
Mac OS is well Mac OS look I'll be
honest I didn't purchase the macbook pro
for mac OS what I really purchased it
for was on the go video editing I talked
about this to an extent in this video
right here but MacBooks and MacBook Pros
even MacBook Airs
are actually when it comes to video
editing thanks to a certain program and
that is final cut chances are anyone
who's professionally edited on a MacBook
laptop has used Final Cut Pro and
there's a good reason it is extremely
well optimized I can edit 4k footage on
here usually around five minutes or so
and it will literally render and around
that same time that is incredible
because
FCP allows for background rendering so
while you're editing and doing other
things on your timeline the program is
actually rendering the video for you
look it takes around 10 to 15 minutes
from my Rison 7 1700 X dual GT X 1080
sli setup to render an equivalent 4k
file that mind you is an Adobe Premiere
Pro which has many advantages over FCP
but one of them is not rendering and
that's really the meat of this video why
I purchased this MacBook Pro for
on-the-go video editing I don't need any
fancy edits I don't need Adobe premieres
special effects to a render travel vlogs
you know
but I don't do sophisticated edits when
I'm not in the studio so this is just
fine for that and it renders so quick I
don't have to sit around and let this
thing heat up in my lap I really missed
the 12-inch MacBook actually gave it to
my sister for Christmas last year so I
decided to up the ante a bit and go for
the MacBook Pro 13 inch again didn't
spend much more than a MacBook last year
like guess this is the base model pro
but there are several improvements over
the 12-inch MacBook that do want to hint
at in this video the first improvement I
noticed immediately was the keyboard so
the MacBook 12-inch model had these
weird butterfly switches that I never
used before almost felt like I was
typing on a desk there was really no
actuation point and the key travel was
extremely minimal
now the key travel really hasn't been
opted all on the MacBook Pro models but
the butterfly series two switches are a
bit more tactile you can feel the click
of it better even though key travel is
still reduced typing is a breeze and I
have to be honest here it feels a bit
better than my ex gets their teens
keyboards 13 keyboard is a bit mushy
kind of like typing on some membrane
keyboard from 2004 the MacBook Pro
though feels very modern now another
huge improvement of this MacBook Pro
over its previous generations the
speaker setup so 13-inch MacBook Pros
really haven't had the best speakers
they've usually been down firing and
toward the front sound a bit tinny the
bass wasn't really there just wasn't
clear overall the 15-inch MacBook though
had really good speakers these MacBook
Pros here have insanely good speakers
even better than a 12-inch MacBook which
already had better speakers than my XPS
13 did here have a listen so you can
think of tessellation as the literal
division of polygons that comprise
objects that we see in games and other
special effects here's the same max
volume config on the XPS 13 so you can
think of tessellation as the literal
division of polygons that comprise
objects that we see in games and other
special effects to touch on poor
selection per second this tends to be
one of the most polarizing topics
regarding MacBook Pros nowadays having
two USB type-c ports gets limiting
especially for some like myself who
content creates a lot so I need
preferably a nasty I would take I don't
know I would swap one of these USB
type-c doubt for an SD card slot I think
I would be okay having a single
type-c port and an SD card slot full
size that would be alright of course I
do miss having USB type a but I'm
willing to accept the fact that people
are ready to move on that's fine Apple
is going to be one of the first
companies innovate if you want to call
it innovation the single headphone jack
on the right-hand side of the laptop is
nice to have although I do find it's
funny that MacBook Pros include
headphone jacks but iPhone 7s do not
that's a little weird to me there are
plenty of strategies we could argue
about regarding Apple but they're
they're a controversial company but it's
one of the reasons why they're so
popular and why they're so successful
take the trackpad for example Apple has
refined this to the point where going
back to any previous generation MacBook
Pro or any other laptop in existence for
that matter feels primitive this is
without a doubt the best trackpad in
existence it's smooth and responsive
through and through and the haptic
engine makes things feel mechanical
despite this literally being a piece of
glass atop a motor battery life is also
excellent i've streamed netflix for 12
hours uninterrupted at around 50 percent
brightness should last you a full day
without a doubt unless you're doing some
serious video editing in which case
expect around five to six hours of
battery life lease with the base model
if you opt for the model with the touch
bar expect battery light to decrease by
around an hour or two there are a few
other physical constraints worth
mentioning if you want to upgrade the
SSD especially the model like this 128
gigs it's not going to be enough for
most people going for a 256 gigs going
to cost you an arm and a leg
not only because well drives are pretty
expensive nowadays but also because the
drive in here is proprietary
well not Apple proprietary but you'll be
hard-pressed to find an SSD that will
fit inside a laptop like this Ram is
also soldered on so a good game Apple
performance of the MacBook Pro overall
though fairly solid this is only the i5
based model with 8 gigabytes of RAM but
it does perform admirably against the
higher priced XPS 13 sporting 16 gigs of
ram and a core i7 frequency will
throttle on demand pretty standard for
most ultra-low power processors and this
one here doesn't get too hot the fan
really only turns on for me when of
course I'm video editing or if I'm on a
Skype call and doing something in the
background maybe opening a few chrome
tabs now to touch on the touch bar
option for laptop like this I talked to
many people who are differing
views regarding the touch bar I played
around with one that had it at Best Buy
and I have to say I really wasn't all
that impressed okay it's an OLED screen
that's really cool so you don't have to
see any weird backlight coming from a
black background but is it really all
that viable I mean to even see the touch
bar you have to be looking at your
keyboard from above so if you like using
this thing on your lap while you're
laying down good game and to be frank
and a few demos I had seen the touch bar
really didn't look all that versatile I
mean sure it had a few shortcuts for
some native Apple apps but I don't know
it just it really didn't ring a bell for
me and it didn't justify an extra two to
three hundred dollar price tag the last
thing I have to complain about here the
camera this is a test of the MacBook
Pros video quality I will say audio is
on point
pretty good for a 13-inch MacBook but
the picture quality is subpar and that's
kind of been the trend with apples a
smaller laptops recently even the
12-inch MacBook stuff are the same issue
is this mediocre video call you expect
better from Apple especially when you're
paying this much for laptop so to sum
this one of the things that I really
like about the new MacBook Pro 13-inch
the speakers definitely the beautiful
Retina display that gets extremely
bright and it's also fairly accurate in
color reproduction and to be honest the
keyboard I would also include battery
life but most ultrabooks can get around
8 to 10 hours so this is really nothing
special for the MacBook Pro at this
point the things that I don't like poor
selection the camera and the price I
have to say though despite paying around
$1,300 for this device I think the pros
outweigh the cons this is a beautiful
laptop it really is and it's so reliable
functional yeah the operating system is
limiting for some but you know you're
getting into that when you purchase an
Apple product in the first place I know
it sounds super strange for a Windows
guy who builds pcs for living and runs
Windows on all of them to recommend a
MacBook Pro but I'm telling you if you
do a lot of traveling and you traveling
at all for that matter and you're
concerned about video editing on the go
spend around 300 bucks on Final Cut Pro
it's worth it for a MacBook of this
caliber and buy a MacBook I know that's
going to earn me some dislikes I get it
but I have to be completely honest here
look it's not for everybody I would say
most people who go to school who just
type out documents and email thing you
can buy a really cheap laptop and do
that this
isn't like the perfect college laptop
because it's so dang expensive but for
people on the go like myself who want to
edit outside of the studio this is an
excellent setup as always you can find a
link to the macbook pro in this video's
description check out the different
models kind of pricings out see what you
think about the system overall if you're
really in doubt about whether or not a
system like this is worth it especially
considering the drawbacks as I mentioned
then not go into your local store and
test one out just get a feel for a build
quality and the operating system I think
those are the two biggest shocks for
anybody entering the Apple ecosystem
