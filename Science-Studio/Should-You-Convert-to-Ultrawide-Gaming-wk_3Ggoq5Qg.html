for game only gaming now I know this is
a subjective question but there are a
few objective things we can analyze like
field of view and GPU overhead we all
generally regard ultra-wide as optimal
editing panels but that should be rather
obvious what isn't obvious are the
gaming benefits for an ultra-wide over a
typical 16 by 9 aspect ratio so let's
investigate
you can choose to look at an ultra-wide
panel in one of two ways either a
reduction in the height of a
higher-resolution sixteen by nine screen
or an increase in the width of a
lower-resolution sixteen by nine screen
let me use my personal LG twenty nine um
57 29 inch ultra wide monitor which you
can find by the way in this video's
description as an example here the
resolution of this monitor is 2560 by
1080 giving it a 21 by 9 aspect ratio
since its horizontal pixel count is 2560
we can then say that this monitor is
similar to a 1440p monitor but with a
25% vertical reduction likewise we can
say that this monitor is similar to a
1080p monitor but with a 25% horizontal
expansion these are in terms of pixels
by the way not physical widths and
Heights although they're all
geometrically similar if we're talking
sixteen by nine versus 21 by nine okay
Gregg great so one point of view is
slightly more optimistic than the other
who really cares well games care I'm
curious to see how games see ultra
whites do they remove excess fields of
view from the top end or bottom or add
additional fields of view to the left
and right or both in all honesty I have
no idea now most modern triple-a titles
include ultra wide support up front just
because all droids have been around for
a while and these games are brand new
but for games that aren't necessarily
new or I guess well it depends on what
you regard is new and what you got is
old but we're talking around 2013 ish
maybe as far back as 2012 2011 do those
games currently have support for ultra
whites and if not how would we notice
that they don't would it just be a
stretched image or would they just chop
off the top or something how do they
solve that problem so that's what we're
going to investigate here in this video
so in GTA 5 quite simply the game
extends the horizontal edges of the
field of view what you're saying in the
darker box is actually the game recorded
on a 1440p monitor just scaled down to a
1080p format in the vertical the lighter
image behind it is that of an ultra wide
2560 by 1080 display this is great news
essentially we aren't being limited
vertically by using an ultra wide in
fact because the horizontal aspect is
stretched we're sending a wider field of
view which I would personally argue is
better than that of a 16 by 9 panel in a
first-person shooter like Call of Duty
there are plenty of
modern first-person shooters out there
it's going to depend in the case of
black ops 3 which isn't really all that
old to be honest the game did not appear
to extend the horizontal field of view
only stretch it out so in essence this
one's taking the 16 by 9 standard ratio
and stretching it into a 21 by 9 ratio
which tells me that this game while
support for ultra wide resolutions is
included is not properly optimized for
ultra wide panels you can tell from this
transition here that the game is just
artificially stretching the 16 by 9
ratio so your field of view is still
just as narrow as it was with the
standard 16 by 9 only things look a bit
more stretched and distorted which is
something I would not recommend for a
game like this cities skylines in
contrast it definitely is optimized just
as GTA 5 is you can clearly see in these
clips here that additional detail can be
seen on the left and right of the ultra
wide picture that is removed when in the
standard 1440p resolution this is zoomed
out as far as possible by the way in a
game like this where productivity is key
ultra wise are definitely beneficial you
can see more and do more without needing
to move or scroll as much funny how the
same thing can be said for content
creation as well even minecraft is
optimized for ultra wide panels which
surprised me a bit given the black ops 3
a game which cost significantly more is
not the next thing to investigate then
is the scaling factor between an ultra
wide and a 16 by 9 aspect ratio I put
each of the three major titles
previously analyzed minecraft is always
finicky so it was left out through a
series of benchmarks and found that with
the exception of cities which heavily
leverages a CPU and that's why nothing
really changed between all three tests
these games scaled equally when it came
to minimum frame rates and by 10% when
it came to GPU and VRAM usage bumping up
from a resolution of 1920 by 1080 to
2560 by 1080 resulted in a 25% reduction
in minimum frames per second for black
ops 3 and 15% for GTA 5 bumping again
from the ultra wide standard to 2560 by
1440 resulted in a slight scaling
reduction for both titles and this is
likely due to the fact that upgrading
from 1080 ultra wide to 1440 adds less
pixels into the mix than the jump does
from 1080 to 1080 ultra wide these
percentages aren't very high not as high
as item
they'd be so if you're reaching that
60fps sweet spot with your current
Reagan standard monitor upgrading to an
ultra-wide shouldn't result in a
substantial enough performance hit to
justify a graphics card upgrade which is
great news
few tweaks of some in-game settings
should suffice for the most part as long
as your CPU is pulling its own weight
preferably somewhere around I 5 or
overclocked FX 8 core territory all
that's left to consider then is price
and that's your discretion not mine on
average ultra whites are considerably
more expensive than their narrower
counterparts but as we proven here offer
a wider field of view in game great
especially for those racing titles and
first-person shooters as long as they're
optimized and you can check steamer
forms to verify that those games are
before you decide the game on an
ultra-wide in any of those titles if you
like what you saw on this video be sure
to give it a thumbs up give it a thumbs
down if you feel the complete opposite
or if you hate everything about life be
sure to click the subscribe button if
you haven't already leave a comment let
me know what you think about altra wide
gaming cut your thing or not like I said
for the most part subjective but there
are some real tangible benefits to
gaming on an ultra-wide panel this is
science studio thanks for learning with
this
