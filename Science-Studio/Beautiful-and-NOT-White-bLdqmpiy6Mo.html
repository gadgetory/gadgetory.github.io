white graphics card now I think white is
slightly misleading because the shroud
here may appear white on camera and I've
done my best to kind of neutralize the
white balance on the camera but the the
shroud itself is actually more or less
like an eggshell off white almost a
cream color when you compare it to an
authentic white shroud that's rather
neutral meaning it doesn't have any
bluish or reddish tones it's neither
cool nor warm this one is definitely
warmer than usual and it does have a
hint of tan in it which is why it
doesn't look very good when thrown into
a system like this one which I've done
my best to keep as neutral as possible
I'm starting things off pretty harsh
here but for good reason I feel like
Galax is slightly misleading the
consumer when they publish neutral white
photos of this card when in fact it is
not the case in real life so don't be
mislead you guys are gonna see a couple
of comparisons here between a car that I
think is more or less neutral white and
this one my walls for example are not
white they are actually more of a cream
tan color and this card is much closer
to that that it is to a true neutral
white so this is something that you
should keep in mind it's it's misleading
I don't know how else to word it this is
one of the reasons why manufacturers
don't like manufacturing white
components I was talking to Chris back
when he worked at be quiet and he told
me that one of the reasons why they
haven't mass-produced white fans for
examples because the fan blades are
manufactured in one space the frames are
manufactured in another place and
getting those two white tones to match
perfectly is a very difficult process
especially when those sites for
manufacturing are in totally different
sides of the planet I can't give Galax
some credit though they at least kept
the shroud and the backplate the same
tone of light so no mismatching on their
end a 1070 TR B's at this point are a
little redundant at least for tech
tubers because what you do it falls
right between a 1070 performance and a
1080 performance we're gonna look at
thermals we're gonna see how loud this
card gets under load I'm not gonna do
any manual overclocking because this
card already gets pretty toasty as is
but it does stay relatively quiet and
that's something else I can commend this
card for these 100 millimeter fans here
do a great job dissipating heat through
the nickel-plated cooler underneath it's
not the beefiest cooler you'll find this
card isn't very
Hevy and that's something you typically
want to look for with a graphics card
you know the heavier the card usually
the the beefier the cooling solution
which means that you can hit higher
overclocks
this card wasn't anything phenomenal in
that respect I think this is more of an
aesthetic approach and again apart from
the off-white shroud I don't think it's
a bad looking card this card is RGB
supported so you have two zones the
first surrounds the backplate and the
PCB up top you have this little plastic
guide here that is a decent job it's
spreading out the light and then a
geforce gtx logo which is also
illuminated and these are both
controlled together via software on
galaxias website which you can find
linked in the video description if
you're interested in and where to find
that it's an easier place if you have a
card already like this one
there are also LEDs underneath
surrounding these 120mm fans at least
surrounding the central portions of the
fans so there are three LEDs for each
one and they only eliminate white and if
you have your card turned vertically
like so then you're gonna definitely see
those three light sources they don't do
a great job of spreading out even though
they've kind of like made these fans
slightly transparent it's just the the
light itself is not very spread out as
you can see along these fans so it looks
a little tacky there I would like to
have seen a more uniform distribution of
light down here something else to note
this card does not store RGB codes in
cache which means that upon booting into
Windows for the first time or even after
just a quick power cycle the card will
display white LEDs by default so in
other words until you open the software
after booting into Windows your card
will not take on the RGB color scheme
that you set it to the last time you
were in the operating system you can
control other things in the software as
well it's more or less like a
rudimentary MSI Afterburner
if you will with the RGB support on
board so you can overclock this card via
the tool and you can also control the
cards fan curves in terms of power
delivery this card really is nothing
special it does have an extra six pin
VGA power connector so that's something
else to keep in mind you will have a
slightly higher overclocking headroom
over that of the standard 1070 TI a
Founders edition card not even sure it's
worth manually overclocking this card
because it's pretty much maxed out of
the box and NVIDIA software is pretty
good about you know fluctuating those
frequencies according to load as well as
thermals and speaking of those temps
this card stays off the radar that's a
good thing especially when running 3d
mark firestrike even in like the ultra
the extreme preset this card
handled the higher resolutions and the
interests the intense scenes much better
than I expected especially from a
cooling standpoint you know this card
isn't very heavy I thought that the
thinner material would would yield
higher temperatures and then what I was
experiencing that a memory got pretty
toasty at around 85 degrees Celsius this
still isn't anywhere near microns limit
sites they were pretty good in the
memory side if we wanted to overclock a
bit more we probably have that Headroom
and then the GPU stayed around 70
degrees Celsius which I would say is
more than comfortable you can put just
around 80 degrees if you really wanted
but the fans would definitely become
audible and that just really depends on
if you're comfortable with a loud system
or not if you're wearing headphones
maybe it won't bother you as much now
just a few other things I want to point
out regarding this card in particular
the back plate is raised slightly higher
than the conventional back plate on most
cards most aftermarket cards anyway and
because of that I would say that this
doesn't have any thermal properties at
all in fact the only reason why they
probably raise this as high as they did
is to allow this diffuser for the LEDs
to be included underneath and it's a
nice touch it's something I'm not going
to be too picky about but there is
something else you should know about
this because the backplate again is
pretty high off the PCB PCIe slot
brackets for full length slots are going
to be difficult to unlatch especially
after putting this card into place
unless you have a really large latch
that you can push back to unhook the
card from the motherboard it's gonna be
difficult to get to this one so have an
arrow tool on hand to unlatch the card
if you plan on removing it any time soon
now the last things I want to discuss
are price and value these are subjective
terms again it's gonna depend on what
you feel your money's worth and also
where you live because Galax cards
aren't sold everywhere the u.s. is one
of the few exceptions on this side of
the globe for example so if you live
elsewhere maybe Canada you might want to
buy one of these secondhand if you're
really into white cards but the value
proposition I really think the 1070 TI
sniper and the 1070 sniper both black
and white I feel like are the poor man's
Hall of Fame cards so if you want to buy
a Hall of Fame card you're gonna spend
anywhere between 100 and 200 dollars
extra on top of just the board itself to
get that additional cooling capacity and
those really clean looks right the white
PCB with the white shroud and the white
fans those cards look super sexy but it
seems like every time I check online
these cards are either out of stock or
extremely overpriced which is where a
car
like this kind of comes into play right
then this is the only thing available
from a company like Galax
this is what you're gonna try to sell
which is probably why I got this card a
lot of other reviewers it seems are also
receiving the 1070 sniper cards so
they're really trying to press these the
prices are relatively competitive for
you know the current market that we're
in although I think they missed the
aesthetic mark definitely with the
off-white shroud and the off-white
backplate the RGB accents customizable
are nice the proprietary software isn't
too overbearing and the card runs
relatively quiet so take these for what
they are if you liked this video be sure
to let me know by giving this one a
thumbs up I appreciate it thumbs down
