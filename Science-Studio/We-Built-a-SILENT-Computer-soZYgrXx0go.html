awkward camera angle setup right now
because I want to showcase this build
here that you just saw us build this is
this build here that you just saw us
build wow that really really nailed it
there what's going on everyone wanted to
showcase and show off another PC build
we put together here in the studio this
is not sponsored might be quiet but it
is utilizing many be quiet components
because we wanted an emphasis on the
silent factor with this one
so what I'm gonna do in this video is
run through the specifications first and
then show you what I mean by silence
because this thing is dead quiet it's
actually a really nice PC to edit with
especially if you're gonna be filming
next to it you really can't hear
anything I think I hear my personal rig
across the room more than I hear this
thing so I'm going to show you what we
use to build this PC this the parts in
particular I have those parts by the way
linked in the video description if you
want to build something similar they are
tied to our Amazon and Newegg affiliate
account so me to get a small kickback if
you decide to purchase anything through
those links so the first piece to this
puzzle is probably the most obvious and
that is the be quiet dark bass 700 this
has RGB integration out of the box you
can actually control the RGB themselves
on the case actually up front they have
a little toggle switch there you can
also utilize USB type-c 3.1 which is
pretty cool I talked more about this
case in my dedicated review right here
but building in it just gives you like
more of an in-depth analysis of the
cases layout and how things work and
where optimal placements are for certain
things like SSD trays and for cutouts
with cables also out of the box you'll
find a few be quiet silent wings three
fans these are some of the best fans on
the market in my book they are super
silent a bit pricey but you get what you
pay for now one of the tech specs we
have first off an i-5 80 600 K which
I'll be reviewing a dedicated video here
shortly
excellent value in my opinion CPU get
six full-on cores no multi-threading
support but for under 300 bucks this is
a heck of a gaming CPU for sure maybe
not the best for content creation I
would still opt for the i7 in that case
but for purely gaming and even some
streaming you could definitely take that
on with the 82nd
okay especially if you want to overclock
it to something like five gigahertz the
motherboard we're using is the MSI
gaming Pro carbon - sexy board with RGB
support I've got everything set to
yellow right now because this is
actually Lisa's build and she's a big
yellow fan so she's really happy about
the the support there we also got the G
scale tread and Zee RGB modules to match
the bore they actually sync up perfectly
with MSI's mystic light software so it
will detect the g.skill ram out of the
box like in the software itself which is
really cool I didn't know that it would
do that and it even detected our
Coolermaster keyboard so now everything
is kind of set to like an orange-yellow
there is no specific yellow color
support with the case so we just picked
orange so it's all kind of like an
orange gold yellow combination but you
get the point
the next thing I want to show off is the
be quiet dark Rock TFT f stands for top
flow so this is actually a top-down flow
CPU cooler and it does have two silent
winks three fans built-in so we're
literally going full-on silent winks
three fans with this bill but that's why
it's extremely quiet you'll see that
here shortly this has a an insanely high
TDP it allows for insane overclock so I
think we're at 5.1 gigahertz right now
on the eighty-six hundred K and
temperatures are still staying around
eighty degrees Celsius under full load
in I 264 so very impressed with this and
it does maintain a very quiet profile
throughout which it's pretty impressive
now the next component want to show off
is the EVGA gtx 1070 TI for the win this
card is a beautiful sexy card I've
always loved EVGA cards they send a 10-7
ETI out for review I decided to put it
in this system here not only because it
is fairly powerful for the cache but
it's also very quiet which fits the
theme beautifully so we're gonna run
some benchmarks with this build in
particular because I expect that people
spending I don't know around 1070 1070
TI money for a gaming PC are probably
gonna pair with something like an i5 or
maybe a loc'd i7 or on a rise in side
maybe rise in five 1600 ish territory so
that's why it's in this build also be
benchmarking like I said with this build
in particular stay tuned for that video
but this card I can say just right now
is literally silent because the fans are
off that's just how it's designed and
when it gets thrown under load the fans
pull up they still stay pretty quiet
because this cooler is
but a silent build wouldn't be truly
silent without a quiet power supply and
that's what we want with a be quiet dark
power Pro eleven I've used this
particular unit in the past quite a bit
it's still going strong and that's why I
want to emphasize it in this build it's
not cheap but again you get what you pay
for if you want products that last then
you got to pay a bit more for them
otherwise buy cheap hardware and keep
replacing the things every one or two
years and a power supply let me tell you
is not something you want to cheap out
on this unit is semi modular but I mean
come on who's not gonna use a 24-pin and
all of the modular cables are in fact
black sleeve which means that they're
not gonna look hideous in your case I
expect that most modern power supplies
will have black sleeves but still it's
nice to have them in this bill because
everything is black now you're not
seeing them because I decided to use
custom sleeve cables from two different
companies or two different people so the
24 pin here in the AP EPS up top were
actually made by primo chill and I just
had them laying around from a previous
build I wanted to throw something else
in here to to spice things up a bit more
and then the - eight pin cables here the
- 8 pin feed VGA cables are from Tony
from Rayleigh PC customs as YouTube
channels link the video description the
guy makes a ton of sweet cables he's
done it for us for several months on the
channel and I just want to give another
shout out and really show off how good
these things look even in a case that
doesn't have any white components you
can find a use for white sleeve cables
now wouldn't make much sense in a build
with silent emphasis to throw in a hard
drive because those do have literal
spinning components I mean think of them
like fans like they're still making
noise because they are moving and that's
why we went with a 500 gigabyte Samsung
SSD in this build only you could add a
second one go raid zero or raid one if
you wanted to get fancy with it but an
SSD is a wise choice in the silent build
because there are no moving parts inside
now to end all of you our suspense I'm
sure most of you clicked on this video
to hear how quiet this build actually is
like no aggregor I bet you it's still
pretty loud we'll see in a second here
at idle it's virtually silent and under
load it's actually still really quiet
even with the side panel off but I'll
put it on and I'll put the microphone in
the build so that you can hear what
happens when the heat kind of builds up
in the case right you get the side panel
off then things are going to be
artificially quieter because you're
basically cooling off your system or
allowing it to have more access to air
from the outside so that build
be compared to just for kicks my
personal rig which is a fully custom
cooled bill that'll be interesting to
see which one is quieter custom cool
build or just you know air-cooled build
using the quiet components I do have a
d5 pump in there along with a 360 ml rad
and a 240 ml rad so with that here are
the sound tests
well there you have it folks
clearly this thing is really quiet in
fact I was actually surprised by how
much of the fluid I could hear in in my
personal rig moving I guess I don't
really pay attention to it because like
water drops and like water moving
through pipes and whatnot actually
sounds pretty peaceful to me
I just don't realize how loud it
actually is but that and the in
combination with a d5 pump makes it a
louder system than I originally
anticipated even though I sit next to it
literally every day it's pretty loud
especially in the case so with that if
you have anything you'd like to add if
you want to show off your a build if you
have a really quiet build that you want
to list aspects of or something along
those lines may be using Noctua or a
competing company to keep your PC quiet
I want to hear about all of that in the
comments below
be sure to give this video a thumbs up
if you thought it was cool or
interesting give it a thumbs down if you
building weed opposite or if you hate
everything about life you should please
subscribe I need to have it arraign stay
tuned for more content like this it's
the science to do thanks for building
