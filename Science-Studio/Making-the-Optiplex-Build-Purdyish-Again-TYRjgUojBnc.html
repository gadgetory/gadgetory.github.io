actually I kind of cheated I've read
some of the comments for this video
the Optiplex system is not very pretty I
mean it's an op deployed system it's not
supposed to be flashy it's nothing
compared to a custom gaming rig if you
will but I chose this system for a
number of reasons first off I bought it
refurbished on Newegg yes I paid way
more than I probably should have but
only because these are going to be
reliable and consistent they're
manufacturer refurbished and they're
sold on Newegg so it can be very easy to
get your money back if something arrives
in bad shape if I recommend you buy
these on ebay every seller is going to
send this thing in a different condition
they might not have a fresh Windows 10
Pro operating system loaded onto the
hard drive or the SSD in this case it's
peace of mind for me I paid more for
that yes you want to gamble a bit more
eBay is a better option I didn't want to
put my name behind generic eBay postings
in this case because it's an entire
system it's harder to ship graphics
cards and stuff it's a little different
so there's my justification but apart
from that another reason why I chose
this specific Optiplex 3010 case and
build is because you can take this
motherboard out of here and throw it
into any other micro ATX or full-size
ATX case that's not the case for all
optiplex systems some of them will use
proprietary boards weird shapes that you
can't really fit because of standoffs
are in different locations or it's just
an awkward you know dimension like maybe
it's too long for a standard micro ATX
or it's way too tall but it's really
narrow
there's some weird motherboards out
there but in this case you can transfer
that because the micro ATX form factor
is sound in here it's the standard m ATX
form factor and then also the 24 pin to
eight pin concerns some of you had when
I swapped the new power supply and
that's not always the case in this case
it was just a standard 24 pin connector
so I could use a standard ATX PSU some
of the Optiplex systems well let you do
that because they do have a proprietary
connector so I chose this for that
reason as well also I mean come on you
get the optical drive
who doesn't like optical drives anyway
in this video I want to show you how 50
bucks can go a long way in terms of
aesthetics we were relying just on the
performance metrics in the last two
builds or where I put together a hundred
dollar system that was purely a
performance system didn't really worry
too much about aesthetics apart from
moderate cable management and then in
the Optiplex video 400 bucks bare-bones
we did what we needed to do to get it to
run efficiently in this video 50 extra
dollars in your budget will go a long
way in the looks department and the case
we're going to use to swap everything
out in here
is the fractal design define mini C
alright now if you're wondering why I
chose the fractal design define mini C
over the Mesha Phi mini C which also
exists it's because fractal doesn't
offer the clear TJ version of the Metro
fly mini see I'm keep getting these
words backwards anyway you know what I
mean so this one's the clear TG looks
much better in my opinion and air flow
properties yeah they're gonna suffer a
bit but it's gonna be significantly
better than this case right here so I
think no matter how you look at it no
matter how you try to justify it you can
get the case that you want you think
looks best or performs the best in terms
of cooling potential but anyway gonna be
again a big step over this case
so let's get to migrating all of this
into this
alright now we've run into a small issue
I already knew this was coming but
basically this case has hardrive LED
power LED recessed switch and power
switch all four right and those were
generally going your F panel or front
panel connector area on your motherboard
in this case we have a proprietary power
I guess you want to call this pin out up
top so this is specifically for the
power switch and you see there's five
pins there and without looking up the
pin out for this particular board which
I imagine would be difficult to find
online at this point in time I'm going
to just jump combinations of these pins
probably not a good idea but whatever
it's a cheap system and yeah I'm gonna
do it for the sake of saving time so
we're gonna see which two pins here
complete the circuit and power up the
whole system and then those would be the
two pins that I wire up to the power
switch that is integrated into the case
so let's yeah let's cross our fingers
here okay alright so figure it out it's
the two furthermost right pins alright
so that makes things pretty simple now
all we have to do is connect these two
pins here on this little cable that I
cut out the yellow and black cables here
we need to connect to the front panel
cables on the case and then we should
have a fully functioning power button we
won't be able to obviously reset via the
switch up top we won't see hard drive or
power LEDs I don't think but I mean it's
something right at least we can turn on
and off the system without having to
take the panel off every time we've got
tiny little wire cutters here at the
very end I think this will work looking
good another good thing about working
with just the power switch polarity
doesn't matter
again all we're doing is completing a
circuit closing the circuit if you will
and so doesn't matter there's really no
negative or positive per se alright cool
so I think it works let's go ahead and
give it a shot and I push the power
button here in three two one hey there
we go fixed one
problem now I'm not sure what the other
pins on the header do one of them what a
combo of those pins might be for power
led I'd again have to dig through the
pin out on this particular board not
really interested in doing that at this
point just want the power button to work
and that is what we fixed here now at
this point you'd probably expect
temperatures to fall around two to three
degrees that's actually exactly what
happened a large reason for that I think
is the fact that we have an extra fan in
here
both of these fans are just gonna be
quieter and generally so that the case
fans so if you're going to switch a
system like this and stay on a tight
budget I recommend buying a case with
case fans already included usually I'm
not a proponent of that just because I
like to give buyers the freedom of
choice and not be stuck paying extra for
stuff they might not use but in the case
of a budget system I don't think that
most people are going to have the
pleasure or the leniency of being able
to pick specific fans that they want
spend extra money on those so it's nice
a tour included I have the one up front
that provides the graphics card with a
dedicated you know swarm there and then
one exhaust fan which should get rid of
the excess heat generated by the CPU few
other things I do want to touch on very
briefly I mentioned in the last video
that the SSD included was particularly
slow slower than I thought it would be
totally just glossed over the fact that
this was a SATA 2 board so say 2 3 6
gigabits per second we don't have that
here at SATA 2 so 4 gigabits per second
and that actually caps our SSD to around
250 or so megabytes per second throw the
reason rights which is why the SSD was
slower than I thought it should have
been
this is actually an SK Hynix SSD which
is a perfectly fine SSD it was just
limited by the motherboard SATA
interface so that's another downside I
suppose was going with an older platform
your drive speeds will be limited so I
didn't intend for this video to be super
technical not like the last two or three
I just wanted to show you how far 50 or
60 bucks can go in the looks department
I think this bill looks a lot cleaner
now despite the fact that we still have
a green motherboard that's gonna bother
me for a while I think this will help
the resale fout that factor and that's
why I did this so I think I'm too far in
now I'm out this is about four hundred
and fifty bucks or so all in here
everything inside I spent
out of pocket right all this stuff I
bought that the case was sent my fractal
so if I flip it at all I'll try to sell
for 500 bucks and then hopefully walk
away with a $50 profit but if I have to
break even I will well throw the 50
bucks in like a giveaway or something
like that but I think the the biggest
downside of this in terms of resale
values the fact that I bought this
refurbished on new egg if I wanted to
straight-up flip these I'd probably buy
them you know used in okay condition on
eBay for 70 or 80 bucks or buy them in
bulk
off a pallet or whatever but I bought
refurbished again because I wanted
Windows 10 priority preloaded the SSD
was nice eight gigs of ram all that good
stuff and it's got a one-year limited
warranty too which is something you
won't find on most eBay listings so with
that let me know in the comments what
you think about this approach here would
you spend the extra money in a case or
not would you just keep it in the optin
plex tower if you're on a tight budget I
totally understand there's also a case
to be made for a clean-looking build and
in a case like this I mean I think it's
a nine-day difference then again that
extra fifty bucks doesn't get you a
single extra FPS potentially a few if
we're talking about temperatures maybe
you could overclock the graphics card a
little bit not gonna be able overclock
the CPU so that really doesn't matter in
terms of like sound it's gonna be
slightly quieter in this case there are
sound damping pads at least on the right
panel and then up top you could also
have that mod you vent just kind of
close things off I have the mesh panel
up here just because I'm more concerned
about airflow and then anything else my
passive heat radiates through the top of
this thing but that's just my approach
to it you know which could be totally
different you guys liked this video
thumbs up you know what to do thumbs
down for the opposite or if yeah I hate
everything about life click that red

become a member if you're feeling
