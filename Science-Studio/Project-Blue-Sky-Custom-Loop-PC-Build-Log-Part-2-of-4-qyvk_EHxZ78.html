slap on a mic and introduce my social
media accounts for those of you who
might be new to the channel but who are
interested in some kind of custom loot
PC like the one which I'm working on
I do recommend watching part one of
project blue sky if you haven't already
check it out in the card right here but
if you want some backstage passes if you
will to all the production work going on
that's not on camera I suggest first and
foremost following me on instagram at
Salazar's studio white tee right there
but you can find it in the video
description as well and then also on
Twitter same exact handle and they're
both run by me personally so if you want
to ask questions or check out some cool
pictures and video then you can do that
by following both of those accounts outs
of a Facebook page where I usually I'm
not as active on Facebook and I should
be but where I usually just post like
video links and I'll show some pictures
as well typically they're all tied
together so whichever social media
accounts you prefer you can follow me on
any of those three so that you check out
some current progress of project blue
sky speaking of which I think you are
ready for some tech porn am i right here
we go
oh you boys are safe
for
the
yeah
you
and here we are I thoroughly hope you
enjoyed the tech porn segment of part
two this is what it's going to look like
apart from the fact that our GPU blocks
aren't here yet
optical told me that those are on the
way they weren't in stock when I
originally requested them now but those
should be here by the time we start
running the the tubes through the whole
system I do want to comment on a few
other things that I realized when I was
throwing the cables in and everything so
the power supplies in there and there's
plenty of space in the back compartment
for cable routing all that stuff well
will take care of more of that in part
three but I did want to mention first
off my man Tony hooked me up with these
epic custom cables the these colors here
these accents you can see he went with
two different tones of blue which i
think is gorgeous now I just kind of
told him to have at it just come up with
something that he thought would look
awesome and a blue seemed to build and
he followed through he doesn't do this
you know normally he just did this for
fun just to help out a friend and I I
greatly appreciate that so don't go away
no knocking on his door asking for
custom cables and stuff he'd just you
know here's a full-time job he doesn't
have time for this but he did make time
for for this one kit and I think it's
really going to pay off in the long run
and once we get the blue coolant in here
I think it's gonna make a blue pop even
more than it already does so
hypothetically speaking let's pretend
like the graphics card blocks are
already here so we're not you know using
the stock EVGA coolers anymore we have
the water blocks fitted and we have the
little sli bridge fitted as well let's
pretend we have that already all
installed and all we have to do now is
run the run the ptg all the way around
the case so let's go through where
exactly everything is going to go
because it is a bit cramped this is a
big case but it's not it's not designed
for you know epic water cooling this
reservoir is actually a bit bigger than
what I would recommend for this case
doesn't realize that till actually got
the reservoir so you kind of have to
work around that going to be a bit
difficult having the funnel fluid up
through the top here but that's only
going to be for filling up I'm not going
to actually run a tube into here so the
fluid will only be circulating in and
out of these two so starting from the
reservoir you can see it says out right
there that is where the fluid will leave
and then
that will um I guess I'm going to just
come down like this behind or underneath
the cables here now was something I
wanted to talk about I originally had
these cables going up and over through
there but it looked a bit weird because
these were pressed right against the
reservoir to just look too crammed so I
decided to cram them another way way
underneath here there's actually uh
there's a little cable management cutout
down here underneath the reservoir I
managed to the reservoir the radiators I
managed to a wedge both the VGA cables
underneath there so it looks a good
strange underneath but you know from the
on the front here once the camera
decides to focus take your time there we
go now it doesn't look too bad so that's
kind of what I ended up going with as
for the 24 pin you know it's always
slightly unfortunate when the 24 pin
lead on the motherboard doesn't line up
perfectly with the rubber grommets on
the case and that's not really a big
deal though I had it funneled from the
top from the top groove up here and
though it's kind of making like a
45-degree angle and then I had this CPU
EPs pen did the same thing so there's
kind of a you know like little diagonal
looking trend going on there trying to
do the same thing with the USB 3.0 cable
but that's not really working out too
well anyway so the anyway the PGG coming
down from here and then it's going to
straighten out then I don't know if I'm
going to need a 90 degree Bend or not
but one way or another set tube will
then upward this way and look at that
parallel port here for both of the water
blocks and then it's going to come up
I'm ghost on the front here so it's
going to come up and then it's probably
just going to I don't know I don't know
if I'm going to do like a 45 or
something or just kind of like bend it
in just cut play it by ear anyway it's
going to go from here to that intake
that will import naught and then the out
port right here is likely going to sue
this is where it can be tricky because
it's going to start covering up this x99
logo assuming a stick with this
motherboard which I'm probably not to be
honest so that's not that big a deal
but the pipe will come back up forward a
bit and then upward actually no I don't
know if I want to do that now because
this is this is interesting I want it to
basically go over the ramp okay I don't
want the RAM to be blocked
I had the tubing anyway and if we
decided to go with RGB dims and we
definitely don't want those covered up
by the liquids I might just have it you
know come out just a bit and then bend
it and then probably bend it back up
maybe I'll put a 90 on here just
straight up I'm not sure how I'm gonna
do that because I needed to go behind
the reservoir so one way or another that
pipes going to have to end up kind of
back here and then the pipes going to go
back here another problem I'm going to
be something about the 24 pin if I
wanted to keep doing it to move up this
way there's going to be a problem
getting the pipe through there so
another issue will cross when the time
comes anyway that pipes going to go up
through to the left port on the top 360
red and then work its way down I think
I'm going to bend this tube and lead it
into that port on the back side and then
of course from there it'll come out from
here and then I'm going to do some
really intricate bend work getting that
thing back into the intake on the
reservoir and of course the pump will
keep that circulation going so I expect
that this Bend right here will be tricky
only because it's so small and so
precise that one's probably going to
take on a 10 tries it's just a
conservative estimate there it's why I
bought a ton of PE T G naught and then I
think that the other Bend that'll be
really interesting is the one from here
to to the radiator because that's going
to be one solid piece however I decide
to route it so that's going to take a
few attempts as well I expect maybe the
one from here to here but I do expect
this one should be pretty much piece of
cake whatever I decide to do there and
then the bend from from here to the
bottom should be fairly simple as well
that's how I have it in my head of
course that never actually plays out on
paper almost never anyway so we'll see
we'll see where we end up in part three
so we do hope you enjoyed watching the
build process as it's coming along I am
having a lot of fun with this build I do
think that I'm going to try to do more
of these in the future obviously just
because building pcs is like kind of
second nature now I've done so many
times I just just kind of repetitive
honestly it doesn't have the spark that
I used to have and that sounds like
relationships in general but now that
we've thrown a different variable with
the mix water
it's like building a whole new PC inside
of a PC if you get what I'm saying like
it's a whole other process that you have
to account for and I think that it makes
it just much more enjoyable and much
more challenging I'm going to try to
finish the bill in part three but this
is you know custom leap stuff so it
could be dragged out to the park for I'm
trying to finish this quickly my LCU
been complaining about other tech tubers
who takes too long to finish custom
loops and stuff whatever they have the
reasons I'm just trying to get this out
of the way because I have other craft to
do you know I'm a full time student so I
got at class and stuff homework
but anyway worst case there would be two
more parts I do want to close the video
by giving another huge shout out to
Alpha Coulomb aqua tuning or hooking me
up with all of this gear this stuff here
that you're seeing and then I also I'm
actually you know I'm just going to walk
over there so yeah this is the rest of
the gear you see a ton of fittings over
here so ninety degrees we have a bunch
of you know just adapter fittings and
stuff like that and then all of this is
PE TG tubing so there's four pipes if
you will in each of these boxes there's
a ton a metric ton of PTT tubing to work
with which means we can afford this
screw up as many times virtually as we
want a lot of fittings in here this is
kind of like a PT g2 bending tool
whatever anyway they were super cool
about sending all of this gear so huge
shout out to them if you guys want to
custom cool anything I mean they even
have stuff that's that's pre-made that
you don't have to do a lot of work to
assemble and stuff like that they have
all of that available on their website I
have the u.s. affiliate opportunity in
the description click on that one if you
live in the US if you live elsewhere
especially in Europe this is a
german-based company so you're gonna
have plenty of access to alpha cool gear
if you live in the US or in Europe or
just anywhere in America for that matter
so yeah big shout out to them again I
cannot thank them enough for making this
possible and I do hope that you guys
consider them for for any future custom
live gear you might be interested in
just you know dual masala dailies check
them out I don't think you'll be
disappointed they offer a lot of cool
stuff if you want to make your rig look
anything like this I do I do hope that
you'll consider alpha cool for your
future custom loop PC build I'll catch
you in part 3 I might upload a video in
between this part and part 3 zone so
stay tuned for that probably the
motherboard of V video that'll be up
shortly
this is Salazar studio thanks for
building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
