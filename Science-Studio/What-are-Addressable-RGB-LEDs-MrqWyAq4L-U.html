and what I mean by that is this almost
every component category comes with some
degree of RGB offering we have RGB cases
RGB motherboards RGB coolers are GB RAM
modules even RGB PS use which I find to
be a little ridiculous and redundant the
last two untouched components are RGB
storage drives and RGB cables you're
saying we already have that okay so
stories change there's officially an RGB
component for every computer port
imaginable Audion l so instead in this
minute science episode we're going to
talk about the differences between
addressable and non addressable or a GPS
speaking of our jeebies that this video
is brought to you by the fantex eclipse
P 350 X it's sitting right behind me and
looking good this no-compromise mid
tower comes in both white and black
variants and sports addressable RGB x'
both up front and below it's tempered
glass panel cable managing is easy
thanks to this invention near the
motherboard tray space is plentiful and
the price is unbeatable and I mean it at
69 bucks I think it's the best in class
so click the link below for more details
so I'm gonna break down the different
LED standards one by one in this video
first we've got a single dumb LED when
it's powered it just lights up and I say
dumb because it's not technically smart
only two wires are required power and
ground and you can vary brightness by
controlling voltage with something like
a potentiometer so all you can literally
do here is dim the LED an important note
here though is that the color of the LED
will always stay the same that's the
case for all LEDs we're gonna talk about
in this video now typical 4 pin RGB LEDs
have separate red green and blue power
distribution lines and they all share a
common ground which is the fourth wire
picture three dumb LEDs sandwiched
together that's literally all this is
individual brightness can be controlled
via dedicated wire voltage control white
is depicted with full-blast red green
and blue LEDs a desired red lighting
which shut off voltage for both blue and
green lines and then yellow is comprised
of green and a red lights combined with
blue being shut off so there are
different ways to blend colors to
achieve a desired look and that's why
our jeebies are so popular because you
can change the
overall lighting scheme unless a fourth
white LED is supported RGB headers have
four pins on a given motherboard and are
typically denoted as a such on the board
now the word addressable in reference to
LEDs describes the ability of each RGB
cluster and a strip to hold a unique
combination of colors or go instead of
the entire strip only depicting one
color at a time addressable LED strips
have the ability of displaying multiple
colors at the same time throughout
different sections of the strip this is
done via ICS or integrated circuits
programmed to respond to specific
frequencies down to a few microseconds
that's right it's that accurate and
precise a common one you'll find is the
ws2812 control circuit and these are
embedded literally into the LEDs
themselves the main board sends signal
down a data inline where I C's respond
and thus control their respective RDB
clusters down to these fine grains of
time it's how you get cool effects like
this one here on the p3 50 X all these
are pre-programmed but you could in
theory have these LEDs mimic any
realistic combination of lighting
effects so in a nutshell addressable
LEDs yield much more creative Headroom
the ability to display different
combinations of colors per cluster plays
a huge part but the degree of precision
involved in the timings of certain
scroll and blinking effects also sets
them apart from their non addressable
counterparts they also cost a bit more
as you might expect but in my opinion if
you want the dynamic control it's worth
it I've linked a few smart and dumb RGB
LED kits in the description below if you
wanna check them out just be sure to
mention voltages a lot of the
addressable kits are gonna require 5
volts not 12 some include a dedicated
control unit though you could run
addressable strips into any motherboard
supporting this feature up to maybe 60
individual LED clusters typically
indicated on the box and via unique 3
pin LED headers like this one right here
