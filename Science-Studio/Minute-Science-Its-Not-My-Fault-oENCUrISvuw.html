feet these large slabs of rock they're
constantly moving pushing against each
other pulling away from each other
sliding
beside each other these are convergent
divergent and transform faults first
let's tackle convergent plate boundaries
there are two types of coverage and
plate boundaries that you'll see
typically on this planet the first of
the subduction zone when heavy oceanic
crust pushes against lighter granitic
crust this is continental crust what
happens is when the two masses collide
the heavy oceanic crust gets forced down
into the Earth's mantle is the
subduction zone where these occur
usually trenches follow and form the
second type of convergent plate boundary
is the kind of Congress and plate
boundary that makes up the Himalayan
mountains this is when two Renick
continental plates collide with each
other and are both forced upwards now
the Himalayas were Mount Everest isn't
the tallest mountain in the world have
formed over time because the Indian
plate has been pushing into the Eurasian
Plate for millions of years now the
elevation of Mount Everest as long as
these place continue to move in the
direction that they are will only get
taller now let's move on a divergent
plate boundaries as you may already be
able to tell divergent plate boundaries
are when two plates continental or
oceanic pull apart from each other an
example of this would be the
mid-atlantic ridge does there are two
plates on either side and they slowly
move apart in the middle there's a big
chain of mountains but these cells move
apart and we can tell the tectonic
plates actually do exist from these
motions in particular this is active
plate movement that we can
see with our own eyes and measure
relatively quickly these plates move it
I mean seven meters a year to sound like
a lot but that's that that is a lot
think about how large the continental
plate is now your third type of fog is a
transformed fall the first thing that
comes to mind typically when a geologist
thinks of a transform fall is the San
Andreas Fault at this fall the Pacific
plate is sliding up north and the North
American plate is relatively stationary
kind of moving down but really it's the
Pacific plate that's moving quite a bit
there are pictures of picket fences that
have moved further down a plane simply
from the sliding of one plate over the
other if you look at this picture here
the Pacific plate is on one side and the
North American plate is on another this
is crazy that that's literally the
boundary between two huge continental
plates there are seven to eight of these
major tectonic plates across the globe
it depends on how you define a tectonic
plate how big they are just remember to
be safe try to avoid volcanoes and also
try to avoid earthquakes if you can
geologists are currently working on more
efficient ways to warn the public of
these impending disasters to work in
progress watch out for those volcanoes
and earthquakes thanks for watching guys
