thought this day would come that Apple
would finally again admit that something
of their something they designed and
manufactured was inherently flawed and
that's exactly what they've done with
the butterfly switches that they've
implemented since the 2015 12 inch
MacBook now I own that MacBook I also
own the 13-inch MacBook Pro with the
second gen revision of the butterfly
switches and that's why I'm making this
video I know most of you don't really
care about Apple you either don't like
them or you don't like mac books in
particular I'm not gonna try to convince
you otherwise you know why I use them I
have that explained in this video here
but as a user and owner of both the 12
inch and 13-inch MacBook with me
switches I can attest to the fact that
these are horribly flawed and it's not
something you'll pick up on right away
because you have to get dust under them
or you have to have some sort of
mechanism failure which happens usually
in the long run - for you to experience
right in order for you to actually hate
the keyboard because at first it's a
weird feeling I don't want to say that
it's a bad feeling it's just a different
feeling typing on a key that has
literally almost no key travel no
feeling of actuation really it almost
feels like typing on just a glass and in
a way that's really cool in a way it's
it's just it's a different feeling and I
like trying different things out that's
why I never really hated the butterfly
switches from just a user standpoint
from a tactile key travel standpoint but
in terms of durability in terms of how
they're designed they are flawed and
Apple has finally admitted that so let's
get down to it why these switches
actually failed and what Apple's going
to do to address the issue and that part
it's gonna be very interesting because
they've actually hired a whole team of
people specialize with repairing these
keyboards because I didn't expect that
they would need to do this when they
first manufactured the laptops unless
they had you know robots or humans
literally typing on these things for
months until one of them failed they
said from this looks interesting and
Apple said don't worry about it now I
don't think many people are gonna
complain
yeah little did they know entire forms
would be dedicated to how much people
hate this keyboard because it doesn't
last very long
the butterfly switch was a revolutionary
step forward from Apple's perspective it
was a change from the traditional
scissor switch that many people use
here's how it works I'm not gonna bother
drawing a schematic on a whiteboard or
trying to show you in some weird
CGI rendition scissor switches this you
have an X you have a hinge in the middle
and these two Hindus are allowed to fold
the point of actuation for the keys in
the center you push down on top and this
is a literally what happens okay so it
fattens when you push it down actuation
is here and then the key bounces up to
resting position here so like a scissor
right now the reason why Apple calls
their switch the butterfly switch is
because the arms of the key mechanism
when folded down look like a butterfly
flapping its wings right so the hinge is
still in the center point of actuation
still in the center you push down on the
key and the arms go like this so if you
keep pressing the key that's what it
looks like right so the hinge is fixed
it's not going anywhere
and the arms are just folding down as
you push the key down the advantage of
this according to Apple was that they
could slim the profile over all laptop
didn't have to be as thick because the
entire key mechanism was thinner and
that of course resulted in minimal key
travel right that was one of the things
that people didn't like about it they
preferred the Machir keys of the
previous MacBook that did have
significantly more heat travel to them
but one of the other unforeseen possibly
downsides of this design is that if you
get even the smallest speck of dust
underneath the key cap then you've got a
serious problem because now one arm of
the butterfly switch at least won't be
able to fold down all the way and then
the key won't actuate Apple admittedly
did a better job with their
second-generation butterfly switches
making them feel a bit more tactile the
key travel was still basically the same
but it didn't feel like you were typing
on glass as much you did feel the key
actually moved this time and click and
that was just a more satisfying feeling
overall especially if you're typing a
long documents on Microsoft Word or
what-have-you
you don't want to feel like you're just
typing on something that's not giving
you any feedback that's why people love
mechanical keyboards but the second
generation butterfly switch did not
solve the issue of crap getting stuck
under the key cap and preventing the key
from working overall by the way when we
say actuated were meaning the key
actually sending a signal to the
motherboard to the operating system that
the key was pushed so that you get a
symbol shown on screen the company's
been sued all over the place
class-action lawsuits and states like
California over the keyboard switched
itself the mechanism failing on them and
Apple refusing to acknowledge the issue
of
the long run has stirred up these
lawsuits and I'm sure Apple just decided
at this point that it can no longer
ignore the massive amounts of people
having issues with their MacBooks so
they decided to start a new repair
program now I have details here from the
verge
according to Apple service page the
program covers the following issues so
letters or characters repeat
unexpectedly if you have that issue you
can get it fixed now letters or
characters do not appear that is
basically the key not actuated which is
what we've been talking about I think
most people have that issue and then
either the keys feel sticky or do not
respond in a consistent manner that
again is tied to the second point and
that is something I've personally
experienced probably more than anything
else is that when you have that sticky
feeling and they're not responding
you're not gonna see any characters on
screen so if you have a Mac a book that
has been purchased within the last four
years which covers every macbook
featuring the butterfly switches to date
if you have the oldest one you probably
want to jump on this as soon as possible
then you can send your laptop in for
repair they can repair specific keys the
spacebar tends to be one that goes out a
lot my spacebar was was crapped out I
had actually fixed that myself and now
it's still starting to get issues again
so I might actually send mine in and
just see what happens and what I'll do
actually I'll probably tell them hoping
they don't watch this video that the
whole keyboards crap because there are a
few keys every now and then they don't
work very well and I'll see if they'll
replace the entire keyboard might as
well but I feel like this is gonna be a
recurring issue right if they're gonna
use the exact same but if I switch this
is just delaying the inevitable again so
maybe they're expecting people to sell
these off or just junk them but then
that becomes somebody else's problem if
you sell it to somebody else on eBay or
Craigslist I'm not sure what their
long-term remedy is here but this is
technically classified as an extended
warranty and it again will cover every
macbook feature in better fly switches
as long as you send it in it looks like
you may be able to take this into an
Apple store as well I'm not too sure if
they'll have certified technicians on
hand for that specific problem but if
you guys have more information regarding
that please
plaster in the comment section below I
will appreciate it personally because
I'm going to try to take advantage of
this as well
myspace bargain in particular has been
just in and out especially on the
corners you know like the corners of the
space bar which is that's primarily
where I hit are some
time's unresponsive that's a pain we hit
the space bar between every word that
you type and it just gets really
frustrating after a while that's all for
this one I don't mean to be like a news
story I don't typically cover news on
this channel but it did give me the
opportunity to explain a bit more how
the butterfly switch works why it's
different than the scissor switch and in
a nutshell why it's failing in the long
run look mostly people are just getting
stuff stuck under the keys right I mean
it happens with any keyboard look at
mechanical keyboards those are
disgusting up for about six months or so
but these keys because the key caps are
are slightly larger than a traditional
key cap and because the mechanism is
just so narrow from a height perspective
anything gets stuck underneath there is
going to possibly allow the switch to
fail and that is where the entire design
of the butterfly switch ultimately fails
is that it has no room for error there's
literally no room for anything to get
stuck underneath there and if it does
the key is basically dead so with that I
want to know what you guys think what
you think about Apple how you think they
address this issue and where you think
things will be headed next time around
right maybe with their new MacBook so
they can improve the switch redesign it
completely
when I hear guys thoughts the thumbs up
for the video if you thought it was cool
thumbs down for the opposite click that
red subscribe button if you haven't
already and stay tuned for more content
like this is the science studio thanks
for learning with us by the way you guys
want to give a huge shout out to at 6464
on twitter for kind of throwing up a
last minute thumbnail for this video I
wanted something creative and I just
wanted to see what you guys could do
with it and I was really happy with the
design he came up with so thanks for
that
I hope you guys enjoyed the video I'll
catch you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
