feel like a sometimes have it all
together and sometimes I just have no
idea what I'm going to create next but
that's because you're not listening hard
enough there's an ambience a sound that
you can hear if you just take a second
and three you hear it
just breathe very deeply and then don't
make a sound
you'll hear it trust me okay okay all
right here we go the liquid battle on a
graphics card
what liquid battle on a graphics card
alright alright I think we're gonna
realize very quickly why this isn't such
a good idea now that it's a bad idea and
I will have to double-check and make
sure that the cooler gigabytes using for
this card is not aluminum you see the
liquid metal we're gonna use in today's
video reacts with aluminum it's actually
the same liquid metal that we used when
we diluted ri9 CP you can check out that
video or right here but because of that
concern I want to make sure that this
cooler doesn't have any aluminum
contacting the GPU die and directly
doesn't appear so that's the case most
of these beefier cards are going to have
copper or nickel plated copper blocks
and then with integrated aluminum fins
if you will that attach to it it's
really no different than a traditional
CPU cooler if it's like a copper base
and then aluminum then that tends to be
how it is and that's because aluminum
doesn't hold on to heat as as much as
copper does so it actually is a better
dissipative heat although coppers a
better conductor of it and that's why
you see copper blocks and aluminum fins
a little bit of backstory there now this
cooler by the way from gigabyte appears
to be an aluminum thin cooler but with a
solid copper base which means that we're
gonna be okay I expect when we take this
thing apart and apply our liquid metal
compound
all right so we'll need of course the
gigabyte cooler we do have the connect
anot kit this comes with an application
tool as well as a cleaning kit of sorts
and of course the liquid metals in there
and then I also have a paper towel just
to clean up some of the initial thermal
compound that will be on the cooler and
then a small tool set so us get into the
graphics card these bits in here these
screws tend to be rather small and
that's why I can't like this will do us
just fine now I want to start first with
the backplate I think this will be
pretty straightforward some back plates
are integrated with the coolers on the
front though and that's something to
watch out for so I'm just gonna remove
as many screws as I can and just keep
going but starting with the back first
because this will block a lot of those
other screws underneath that are pressed
against the PCB likely holding the
cooler against the GPU so back plate
first these are gonna be fairly small
Phillips screws not a problem I expect
these four right here are holding the
cooler directly against the the GPI by
the way while we're doing this I went
ahead and took the liberty of testing
the card beforehand so before the liquid
metal application just to see cuz the
whole point of this video after all if
the liquid metal makes any difference
and I expect that it'll make a small
difference but not as big a difference
of course as it would swapping out the
Tim that's included in stock Intel chips
that's because Intel chooses the
absolute worst compound known to man to
use between the die and the IHS of that
CPU you know sometimes you can just give
this a little force and usually the the
GPU paste and even the thermal pads will
help adhere the cooler to the card even
without any screws attached to the
cooler so yeah I should have checked
that earlier on but you can just pull it
apart be careful II don't want to flex
the PCB at all you can see here we have
a perfectly detached cooler from the PCB
save the backplate which is still on
here but it's not really going to affect
our ability to remove and replace the
thermal compound so we'll go ahead and
clean this up and then we will reapply
with liquid metal you know as I'm
cleaning this I'm noticing that the
thermal compound already on here stock
is not that bad the consistency is about
what I'd expect from like mx4 you know
arctic mx4 paste so maybe that's
attributed in part to the fact that this
is a brand new card but I've replaced
brand new
GPU paste before and a lot of it's been
pretty disgusting so good on gigabyte
here to include stuff that's not crap
out of the box and again we're gonna
keep cleaning this off we want to get as
much of it off as possible before we
apply the liquid metal because that
stuff's gonna get really messy in its
own right and we don't want any of this
preventing a liquid metal from making
perfect contact with the cooler or the
dye underneath all right so you can see
we cleaned up quite a bit of that now
I'm going to use the included cleaning
kit with the conduct not stuff it just
has a couple alcohol pads in it I'm
gonna clean up the rest of this paste
around the die and then we will apply
the liquid metal now one thing I've
definitely noticed is that the Turing
dies the equivalent Turing dies are much
bigger than Pascal dies which means
we're going to need to apply a lot more
liquid metal to this entire surface area
so all of this is going to generate a
heat and we want to make sure we cover
all of it as evenly as possible
so that we get an even distribution of
heat and heat transfer to the cooler now
something else to note is that conductor
not is of course conductive which means
you don't want this stuff coming into
contact with anything that it's not
supposed to we just want to cover the
die we don't want it touching any of
these smaller bits around the GPU if we
of course don't want to touching
anything else on the PCB so we're gonna
be very careful about how we apply this
and because Turing is so large and
because these smaller components on the
on the GPU or so close to the die we're
gonna have to be especially careful that
none of this stuff touches any of those
other components okay so it dies as
clean as it's gonna get and we're going
to apply the liquid metal now this is
again a much larger surface area so I
expect we're gonna need about twice as
much as we've used in the past for say
the 8700 kg lid maybe as much if not
slightly more than we used for the i9d
lid so I'm just gonna apply a small
amount here and then we'll spread it as
much as we can I think that's a good
start you can see it just kind of balls
up like that we're gonna take one of
these little applicator tool to
literally just q-tips and we're gonna
spread this out as much as we can I'm
gonna start with the right side over
here
Pepsi's no no this is no time this is no
time for a cat this is important
business I could fry a $900 card $800
card it's removal cheaper than a serious
one it's still spreading again I want to
be very careful not to get let this
stuff run over the edge of the die
that's the mirrored part in the center
of the chip we do not want this stuff
touching those smaller bits around the
die and I think I've just about spread
out this as much as I can given what we
put on there I might need to add a
little more let's see how far we can
take this all right now I'm pretty sure
I have covered the entire time you
Center it up there see the entire die
looks to be covered I've never done this
before I've never applied liquid metal
to a graphics card I figured touring
would be a chance for me to kind of go
all in here and just put it all on the
line all 800 bucks or so with a hardware
that gigabyte sent me and just wing it I
don't even know this is worth it I have
no idea if temperatures are even gonna
drop by that significant an amount where
it might be worth it for some of you so
maybe the card runs cool or maybe it
runs quieter as a result how quieter
though I don't know because I've never
done this before and I don't even know
if I'm gonna fry the card maybe when we
apply the cooler back to the other side
it's gonna kind of push this liquid
metal one of those smaller bits and then
we'll fry the chip and the whole boards
dead so it's one big risk but I figured
turning will be a cool place to start
because this is the new hot thing right
now not not literally but something that
would catch you guys's attention so
let's see I'm gonna apply more liquid
metal to the cooler side of this you can
see we have the bare copper here I'm
gonna apply liquid metal to that just to
make sure we have proper contact on both
sides and then we'll put it all back
together and run our temperature tests a
few moments later okay so to keep the
story short and sweet I couldn't apply
liquid metal to the bare copper it just
wouldn't stick I probably could have
realized this if I had done a bit of
research but I wanted to do this
firsthand you know and document without
knowing much about this at all just so
that I could learn firsthand I think
that's something that's important for a
lot of people we don't really get that
much anymore we just look things up on
the internet and that's how we learn but
I wanted to do it again with my own
hands just so that I could see for
myself what happens if I try to do
something that doesn't work so we're
just gonna stick this cooler back onto
the die and hope that liquid metal makes
proper contact with the
anyway if it doesn't we'll know by the
temperatures a quarter run a lot hotter
but if the temperatures are lower then
we'll consider it a successful liquid
metal application and who knows maybe
I'll even recommend this although I
doubt it
alright so this is actually a pretty
simple car to take apart now that I've
done it up front and I realize that
there are only about seven screws to
remove in order to get to the GPU so
that's actually really nice it's the
nice thing about this card a lot of
cards overcomplicated I know EVGA cards
in the past have been very difficult to
take apart now that they expect you to
take them apart so they make it easier
for you but if you ever want to get down
and dirty under there and it's nice to
only have to worry about seven or so
screws so good on gigabyte for that
aspect of this card okay so the card is
back together and now for the moment of
truth I'm gonna put this back into our
test bench the same one we used in the
last video and hope that it even posts
to begin with I would be totally fine if
this card posted but then got too hot it
would just mean that we aren't making
proper contact with a cooler although I
expect we we are I don't I would be
surprised if it's not contacting the
cooler properly I would honestly be more
surprised if this card even posted to
begin with so let's do that and cross
our fingers that's really all we can do
at this point
okay I got the system set up
Pepsi's over there chewing cables while
my white balance is so off on this
camera and we're going to power it on
right now okay it's lighting up that's a
good thing
fans are kicking in by the way the
monitors on the ground don't make fun of
me I just have no space in its office
anymore that everything set up
all right so f1 2017 is loading up right
now I use this benchmark loop to stress
test graphics cards and this one is
actually not turning its fans at all at
the moment that's a good sign it means
that the card when not stressed has its
temps in check so see they're just
idling not moving at all and now we're
gonna start the benchmark and see just
how hot this card gets under load check
the deltas with the tests I ran before I
recorded this video and see just how hot
it gets I want to make sure that the
in-game settings are identical just for
consistency sake we'll benchmark
Australia heavy rain and show the frame
rate Conor that's fine and we'll loop it
and let's start the test
well pretty much what I expected this
card did not benefit at all really from
liquid metal application we saw one
degree Delta but that's to be a simpler
than the margin of error and it's a
testament as well to the fact that
manufacturers of graphics cards are not
putting absolute crap between their dies
and their coolers not so much the degree
that we equate this to Intel and they're
terrible thermal interface material
being sandwiched between their IHSS and
dies so now what I want you to take away
from this is that liquid metal ocation
on most graphics cards is an absolute
waste of time now if you have a really
old card and it's just got really chalky
thermal paste and you know it needs to
be replaced then maybe you might can
make a case for liquid metal application
but honestly you're gonna be just as
fine using something like mx4 and and
that's gonna cost you a lot less it
won't be as you know time-consuming to
spread out and it you don't have to risk
any of your components around the die
frying which will essentially render
your graphics card a brick I really
expensive more than likely so I'm glad
this card still works but I mean this
was ultimately just a big waste of time
that's why you don't see people left and
right for replacing stock thermal
compound in graphics cards with liquid
metal it makes no sense the deltas are
non-existent
we saw literally no change in the sound
test either I mean these are these cards
sound the same before and after because
the temperatures were basically the same
before and after all so if you're
wondering why this card ran cooler than
our beefy asu's card it's because the
ACS card was running at a higher clock
speed so around 2000 megahertz out of
the box whereas this one was running at
about 1900 out of the box pretty
consistent and the temperatures leveled
out pretty much where I expected them to
given those clock speeds so I hope that
if you didn't learn something you at
least found this video slightly
entertaining but if you were curious as
to whether or not liquid metal
occasionally graphics card was viable in
the first place it is not and if anybody
says otherwise it reference this video
to them at least for any new ish card
liquid metallic ation makes no sense so
I'm glad we were able to confirm that in
today's video I don't want you guys
wasting your time that's part of the
reason why I went ahead and just
followed through with these tests also I
want to say that the gigabyte card is a
really nice one this card did appear to
be slightly louder than I expected in
our sound test because there is a fair
degree of coil whine with this at least
this specific card here there wasn't any
coil line that I could hear from the
Asus card so this one here a little bit
more coil on again though when your case
is closed and everything
running and especially under load you're
not really gonna hear the coil line as
much it's just where I had the mic place
when we were running the sound test that
it became a little more noticeable
especially daring playback the rest of
the card is built very well it's still a
plastic shroud on top but I like the
fact that gigabyte got rid of the orange
accents so it matches pretty much any
system any build you could potentially
put together out there black and gray
much anything else so that's a nice
touch it's a quiet card it's a much
cheaper card than the ACS card but it's
still expensive still in RTX 2080 and
you guys know how I feel about that so
please let me know in the comment
section below what you think about these
tests if you've done something like this
before and what your results were like
to know the conditions in which those
tests were run if you like this video
give us one thumbs-up I appreciate it
