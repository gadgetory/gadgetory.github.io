head-to-head matchup today between the
NC Xth 700 i which i've already reviewed
in a dedicated video you can check out
or right here and the Coolermaster h 500
p match this is an all-way chassis this
is black chassis with white accents so
you kind of got to pick your poison
there whichever one you think will fit
your color scheme better but these do
have very similar features in some
respects in other cases they're totally
different and that's why this video
exists maybe it'll make your decision
just a bit easier alright so what I'm
going to do to make things very simple
keep it uniform and keep it consistent
is take this exact build in the NZXT
stage 500 I sorry I'm I get these names
confused quite a bit and throw it into
the cooler master H 500 P mesh H 700 H
500 there you go one's from NZ x2 you
want some cooler master now this is a
white B through 50 motherboard from MSI
we have white ddr4 from Corsair and a
black EVGA GTX 1070 for the win 2 card
now more of a white color scheme at
least from the component standpoint but
again the chassis is black so it fits
but it's not a complete white theme
whereas this case is begging for all
white components so I expect the
motherboard will look a bit nicer in
here again though if you're going for a
white case you probably want to pair it
with some white components and that's
why I'm using what we have in here for
the H 500 P build I'm pulling away for
just a second I want you guys to get an
idea for the dimensions of these two
cases before I take the parts from one
and put them in the other so you have
right what everything looks like on this
side already kind of in your head I'll
take a screenshot of that and then I'll
try to put it right next to the H 500 P
when we have these parts in here so you
can get a side-by-side comparison of
what things look like in each of them I
want to conserve the components because
I want to you know again keep things as
consistent as possible now dimensionally
these cases are very similar it's
another reason why they're being
compared these are technically mid
towers even though they're fairly large
mid towers they have 7 PCIe slots at the
rear this one supports vertical graphics
card mounting natively this one does not
this one has top rad mounting support so
does this one up to 360 mil same with
the front and each although you have a
more difficult time in this case
mounting things up front because you do
have those two large 200 millimeter fans
in the front those are already be
capable however
and this is where Coolermaster shines
NZXT on the other hand has terrible case
fans out of the box but they do have an
integrated RGB strip and a fan
controller included one other thing I
want to point out a key distinction
between these two builds the NZXT hfih
hard drive has decent airflow I've done
tests with the front panel and the top
panel both on and off and we see a four
to five degree Delta under full load
after about an hour or so of running GPU
and Seath you synthetic benchmarks
that's not too bad of a delta I would
like to see something up front that's
not just a solid flat panel you know
this is more of an aesthetic thing at
Coolermaster again you know I'm sure
most of you know this originally had
that acrylic front panel and then they
swapped it for this mesh panel and
that's why it's called the H 500 P mesh
so we're gonna test their most in this
case compare them to this one and then
see you know just how things stack up
right if you're going to weigh the
airflow more this is probably gonna be
the case for you if you weigh aesthetics
more it depending on which color scheme
you're going for if you prefer the
all-white chassis Kula master again
takes the cake but if you like a more
cohesive just economic building
experience then I have a feeling that
the NZXT case is gonna be the one for
you we'll also talk budget and stuff
after I swap the parts speaking of which
let's go ahead and do that
so the build is now finished in the H
500 p.m. and I've got to say I really
enjoyed building in its you know cases
or hit or miss right you either have a
fun time building because there's not
much restricting you in the way of cable
management and the way of space and and
then sometimes you know why the case is
just terrible to build you have a
terrible experience you can't get that
right panel on and then you're just like
yeah I'll just throw it all in here and
hope it fits you know I really took my
time with this one because I could
because I had the space to do that
granted I also had the space in the H
700 I but for different reasons and I
want talking about that first cable
management so the H 700 I takes a very
functional approach when it comes to
cable management you'll find on the
right side that there are several
basically channels with which to run
cables they have integrated velcro
straps and this should keep things nice
and tidy I did find that the the one
issue with the way NZXT set things up
here is that if you want to use cable
extensions you're gonna have a difficult
time trying to route those extra cables
right the extra lengths because these
channels are more or less designed for
generic you know specified cable runs so
if they're longer do two extensions
you're gonna have to find some extra
space outside of those channels and then
it looks pretty sloppy so definitely
something to take into account now the
cooler master case has taken a totally
different approach they use two plastic
panels basically one behind the CPU
cutout on the motherboard which is
actually pretty cool idea and then
another one where are the generic cable
shroud would be toward the front of the
case and you literally just stuff as
many cables as you can behind these and
boom you've got a clean-looking build
just like this one here and you know it
doesn't look too great behind these
panels I would I would be ashamed if you
saw what was behind them but that's the
point you don't need to see what's
behind them because those plastic panels
are there and they're pretty sturdy too
they're held on by two screws at least
the the larger one is the one behind the
motherboard tray just kind of snaps into
place so fairly ingenious what they've
done here now there are few things
Coolermaster have definitely ripped off
from NZXT
I don't think they've patted any of this
stuff so in my book it's fair game the
first is the power supply brackets what
you would secure to the PSU itself and
then that bracket is secured to the
chassis so it's fairly easy to install
from the rear Coolermaster have also
included two SSD brackets on top of the
basement which is I'm pretty sure
something that the s340 is at first and
it fitted into a first aid F
they made it mainstream the Kula Masters
done it well here they've kind of made
it their own fairly easy to install just
four simple screws and then you can
secure the bracket back to the basement
with a thumb screw
cooling support in both cases is fairly
similar the NZXT h 700 I support sup to
a 360 ml rad fan combo up front and up
top with a 120 or 140 ml fan mount at
the rear and the cooler master h 500 p
mesh has support for a 360 ml rad up top
which i've done here just a kind of
proof of concept and also I wasn't sure
exactly how I was gonna mount things in
the front now Coolermaster includes a
separate bracket that will allow you to
extend fan support up top not sure why
you'd want to do that because you have
two huge Twitter millimeter fans up
front now but if you wanted to remove
those or throw something like a 360 ml
rat up here you can do that the only
problem is the bracket they included is
black so it doesn't really match with
the rest of the frame I don't think
you'd want to use something like that
just stick the radiator up top or just
put a 240 mill down below where you do
already have that white bracket space
both cases of a fair amount of cable
cutouts the H 200 I choose as a cable
shroud over rubber grommets which I find
a bit distasteful it's just it's a
little too ostentatious for me it still
hasn't grown on me completely I think
it's definitely an NZXT signature like
neoman you know it's an in 60 case when
you see one but it's just not as
functional as rubber grommets in my book
and that's why I think that the H 500 P
mesh from Coolermaster wins in this
regard
you get three large rubber grommet e
cutouts and then you have plenty of
support in the basement as well for
things like HD audio and USB 2.0 ports
now we're in zxu Senate right is with
their basement I love the modular
approach to the SSD trays kind of
getting to move those where you see fit
you get a third one at the front so you
can show off an SSD of your choice the
cooler master case chooses a modular
basement design you actually have to
remove half the basement with two screws
actually no I made two or three screws
it was more than I thought was necessary
and you had to actually unscrew one of
those from the base of the case which
means you have to turn it on its side
just it was a bit of a hassle and you
have to do that if you want to load hard
drives into the case because you can't
do it from the right side you have to do
it from the left side which is
definitely unorthodox
the SSD mounts themselves though on top
of the basement like I said pretty
standard I don't have a problem with
those too
behind it by the way is fairly large you
should have a problem getting a SATA
cable up to any of those drives so there
are definitely a few things I would take
away from both cases the cable shop from
NZXT I think just needs to be scrapped
altogether replace up rubber grommets
and then for the coolermaster case this
plastic shroud I'm pretty sure is offset
right it's indented a little bit in that
motherboard tray because they want to
make more space for cables when you're
stuffing those with that plastic shroud
on the right side I get that they want
more volume it just makes things easier
when it comes to cable management and
that's cool but i think they should
adopt the fractal design approach with
their define CMS fic limit the
motherboard support to just ATX may be
slightly larger than ATX thing you know
like there are some extended ATX boards
that aren't very long they'll still fit
in cases like this even when they're
indented the way that they are so it
looks a bit more uniform doesn't look
like I just slapped a piece of plastic
in here to fill the void if you will now
these are the two tempered glass panels
included with the cases I like in z-axis
approach with the non tinted version
especially for the white chassis just
looks it just looks better in my opinion
a white chassis with a really tinted
panel looks a little cheap to me and
this one is slightly more tinted in a
holding side-by-side you can see the one
on my left here is slightly more tinted
and I would like to see this completely
transparent I just think it looks a bit
cleaner for at least the white chest if
you want a darker chassis and a tinted
panel I know that probably looks a bit
more uniform but having a really bright
case on the exterior and then a really
dark interior just doesn't gel well with
me by the way something that needs to be
scrapped completely in this Coolermaster
case is this little turn dial here it's
a lock mechanism that keeps the panel
upright if this thing unlocks and the
panel just kind of hangs there it
doesn't fall completely so I'll give
them credit for that but this shouldn't
exist at all you actually have to use
something pretty sturdy to turn this
it's it's impossible to turn with just
your just your fingers so yeah this this
is not good at all I prefer NZXT T's
approach with just the thumb screws
that's pretty conventional they tried to
be different here and it just didn't it
didn't work out one of the comparison I
want to make this is the front panel of
the H 700 I ignore walter white on there
and then this is the top panel of the
500 p match don't worry the top panel on
the front panel this case are identical
this is much more sturdy it's not made
out of plaster
like this one is it's also much more
difficult to remove so I would give
credit to a coolant master to make any
easier to remove albeit it's probably a
little bit a little too easy to remove
that's why they've included a thumb
screw at the rear with this revision but
the NZXT case definitely feels a bit
more premium now I want to look at price
because I really think that's where
we're gonna see the difference here I
would be very surprised if the cooler
master case is priced the same as the
NZXT case look you get you know a couple
of RGB strips in here you get the the
fan controller and you also get a very
premium feeling case most in 60 cases
are very premium nowadays and most of
their users and purchasers can
appreciate that
the cooler master case is more optimized
for airflow not necessarily that premium
feel they certainly have premium cases
how they're but this isn't one of them
so if this is under 200 bucks I will be
satisfied with it now let's check I'd
actually don't know what the the price
of the case is 150 USD that's actually
not bad it's about what I would price
this at especially with this thing taken
to account and being at $200 it's
probably a little overpriced to be frank
I think they're charging extra for the
LED strips and the fan controller with
the software you're not really paying
for that though right you're paying for
the chassis for the looks that's what a
case is all about right the building
experience and the presentation and I
think that coolermaster really nailed it
here the NZXT case is a bit more classy
I'll give it that but the cooler master
case is a bit more functional from the
front maybe not from the rear you know
it's just a quick and dirty solution the
cable management NZXT kind of went over
the top I think on the right side but
this is still going to be a pretty
difficult choice for most people if
you're willing to spend the extra fifty
bucks you're gonna have a very classy
system but if you're willing to shave 50
bucks off that budget throw it into a
better graphics card or something along
those lines you'll still have excellent
airflow you'll have an all-white chassis
for an all-way build if you're into that
sort of thing and you'll also have two
very large RGB integrated fans up front
for again optimising airflow so I'm
gonna leave the answer up to you I'm not
gonna say which one I okay I'll go ahead
and say I like value eyes the cooler
master case when I think the cooler
master case is a better value but from
an aesthetic standpoint I think in zxt
they did it really well here it's not my
favorite case
I don't think either of these is my
favorite mid-tower it's gonna be
difficult to throw in the the define C
or the mesh fic which is my favorite
case to date but these two definitely
have a very unique stance when it comes
to design and when it comes to
functionality and I think that most of
you can appreciate those with that I
want to hear again what you think about
both cases in the comments below do you
own one do you own the other do on
something else that you think should be
compared to these two cases I appreciate
you guys watching give this one a thumbs
up if you liked it dislike it if you uh
if you disliked it or if you hate
everything about life I'm not gonna feel
you know angry at you you can click that
