memory configs and to be honest we kind
of take it for granted nowadays it's
because most conventional motherboards
in 2018 are set up to support dual
channel memory out-of-the-box all you
needs a pair of ddr3 or four modules and
to avoid pulling a verge and placing
them in the wrong slots like this that's
literally all it takes to enable dual
channel support it's super simple but
what if we stripped a solid gaming PC of
this feature would the average gamer or
content creator even notice the
difference between dual and single
channel memory configurations we're
gonna find out in this video
gaben wads vertical PCIe kits are back
in stock meaning you'll have the
opportunity to trick out your rig and
swing that graphics card sideways free
unique look that's sure to impress your
fellow pc gamers the bracket itself is
extremely durable and easy to assemble
the included riser cable is sturdy and
reliable and the included display cables
are custom and solid ok I'm running out
of adjectives no snag one while you can
on cable mods online store via the link
below the tests will conduct in this
video are straight for it I've got my
personal rig behind me it's the one I
use for both gaming and content creation
I'll keep two modules in here these are
g.skill shredding xe-dom' supporting a
frequency of 3 gigahertz which will run
out for the duration of this video but
the first set of tests will gather our
baseline data by running everything in
dual channel mode looks like this this
is what you'd expect most people to
currently run and then I'll slide one of
the modules into an adjacent slot that
breaks the dual channel memory config in
the case of this motherboard slots a1
and b1 are optimal for dual channel so
running our second set of tests with RAM
and slots a1 and a2 gosh this is cringy
should keep us on a single channel now
after running through the data will
circle back and discuss why we saw what
we saw and go into more detail as to
what dual channel configurations
actually do for a system these here are
the system specs the benchmarking rig I
guess you could call it all games by the
way are loaded from a 2 terabyte hard
drive 7200 rpm it's a Toshiba Drive this
format is indicative of what I imagine a
majority of gamers out there currently
have so starting with those games grand
theft auto 5 give us approximately 137
FPS on average and the high preset in
the dual channel config in a mere 110 in
a single channel this is honestly not
what I was expecting I had seen many
articles testing this very game and
concluding that the channeling was
virtually irrelevant right single
channel for a still channel doesn't
really matter for this game that's
definitely not the case at least from my
own testing and I ran these tests
multiple times to confirm I imagined the
CP is being forced to keep up with
faster draws from the graphics card at
lower resolutions the GPU can render
frames significantly faster shifting
that bottleneck to our CPU I created a
frame time graph for this game as well
so you could see the trend over time for
both runs at a few places to to performs
similarly but the dual channel configure
Ender's frames significantly faster for
a solid chunk of this Ben
mark up next ashes of the singularity
pretty much just a benchmark game at
this point
proves to be even worse of a candidate
for single-channel memory configurations
framerate drops by as much as 40% we're
seen across the board I ran this one a
few times more than usual to make sure
that my results were consistent I even
tried a single stick of RAM just to make
sure I had nothing to do with the way I
was stacking the RAM and the motherboard
and yes the frequencies were locked to 3
gigahertz before and after I imagine
this has a lot to do with the dx12 API
which we predicted long ago would
leverage more of the CPU in an effort to
maximize parallelism that word gets me
every time
a parallelism moron dx12 in this video
right here now diving further into this
theory I tested shadow of the Tomb
Raider in DirectX 12 as well and was
rather relieved to see that our
framerate drop wasn't a substantial this
time around 101 versus 71 that's still
pretty substantial but not as bad as
before with a mere 8 FPS split among our
lowest point 1% of frames drawn
assassin's creed Odyssey was a much
better story and though the frame rates
across the board were still
significantly lower than the very high
preset 66 vs. 56 is definitely
noticeable on average and then 36 verse
31 down low not as bad but the
percentage difference there between the
frame rates is still very consistent
lastly f1 20-17 pumped out a sweet 119
FPS this game always performs well
especially with Nvidia graphics cards in
the dual channel configuration dropping
by a mere 13 fps in single channel
similar margins were reserved for the
lowest 1% and point 1 percent of frames
drawn by the way as well so not as bad
with f1 2017
but across the board we did see a dip in
frame rates which again is contrary to a
lot of the online sort of like website
reviews of single versus dual channel
memory configurations I'm not sure why a
lot of them were getting nearly
identical for take this one for example
I mean this guy was getting almost
identical frame rates before and after
the switch to single channel memory and
I even tried Grantha but a 5 just like
he did but my marchant's were much wider
than his in fact his almost looked
negligible across the board so I can't
speak to their results but I can tell
you I am 100% behind these benchmarks I
trust these I triple check them at least
triple check them
and yeah this is the state of Dover
single-channel memory right now so yeah
let's uh let's discuss the results the
gaming benchmarks can be summarized into
one big it depends most CPU intensive
titles like ashes of the singularity
will deviate quite a bit from a baseline
tool channel config by the way this may
vary slightly uncomfortable
AMD platforms since both companies
manage memory pipelines slightly
different and it isn't as different as
it used to be but it's still noticeable
but gist of the story is that memory
calls from the CPU are being bottleneck
right by a single channel now in some
games you won't notice much of a
difference at all f1 2017 for example
didn't seem to care really I mean at all
if it's there's a there's a difference
there but it's it's not as substantial
differences before in fact you'd be
hard-pressed to discern the two if I
showed them side-by-side that in game
experience so I imagine this will be the
case for most gamers in most titles but
again in today's most intensive titles
are clearly discriminating between the
two configurations which is why it's
important to abide by motherboard manual
recommendations I thought it was very
cool that the gigabyte Z 390 designee
and my test rig warned me upon first
boot that the RAM modules weren't seated
in their optimal slots this is what it
looked like of course it wouldn't matter
if you plan on running four dims at a
time but in case you happened to miss
this indicator the splash screen upon
posting is a nice feature and that's
sure to save you from headaches that I'm
sure the verge ran into when they first
did this although he says that he knew
what he was doing so remember that
system Rams purpose is to store
temporary chunks of information the CPU
sees fit the benefit here is ultra-low
latency and assuming you have sufficient
capacity ample storage for intensive
tasks you could in theory use something
as slow as a hard driver even a floppy
disk to store all of this temporary
information as much as you could but it
would require constant rewriting since
the stuffs intended to be volatile
that's not good for those drives and
perhaps most importantly calls from the
CPU would take forever relatively
speaking over something like this SATA
interface now all dual channel configs
do is double available bandwidth the CPU
meaning any large calls for information
from the RAM won't have to travel down
in there or paths at which point latency
increases and frame rates drop that's a
bit of what we saw in this video
you can really think of bandwidth like a
highway the more bandwidth available the
wider the highway meaning more cars can
move freely at the same time the cars
are packets of data this doesn't make
sense
now in the case of ashes of a
singularity where physics calculations
are hammering certain parts of the CPU
several threads were under near 100
percent load especially in that
resolution we would expect dual channel
memory to benefit us to an extent sans
instructions are typically copied to and
pulled from RAM in an instant all the
time this prevents errors and data
losses during that execution again what
really matters are the program's
themselves and how they utilize
resources at their disposal now I know
that the video title says gaming and I
feel like you got a good dose of that
but I want to reveal a case in which a
system can benefit from dual or quad
channel memory even outside of the
gaming sphere and that's content
creation now the application in mind is
Adobe Premiere I use it a lot in my
testing I actually use it all the time
for videos like these and I'm curious to
see how a simple render affairs we've
got 4k footage mixed up with 1080p
footage on a 10 minute and a five-minute
timeline and the resulting bars indicate
how long in seconds the render took and
dual versus single channel memory makes
surprise-surprise
an enormous difference here a three are
so many difference in the case of a
10-minute video render and a two minute
difference in the case of a five-minute
render I mean these are we're talking
around 40% difference here in terms of
just waiting for this thing to render it
would make absolutely no sense for any
serious content creator to run in single
channel and this is why in fact many
workstations sport quad-channel memory
configurations which again doubles the
bandwidth of a dual channel the law of
diminishing returns comes in pretty
handy in that case though and is useful
really for only those applications
taking advantage of huge chunks of
system ram right where tons of data
again the picture tons of cars being
pushed on a highway you want several
more lanes if you can have them that's
what quad channel does opens those lanes
up so the CPU can send and receive more
information to and from the RAM in a
much quicker amount of time without
those latency is involved so I hope this
video at least satisfied your morbid
curiosity and maybe you'll learn to
think of - I know I did researching the
stuff scripting the video most of us
with two or more modules are running in
at least dual Channel you're probably
fine but many are still stuck with a
single
so at least now you know what you're
missing and some of today's newer titles
if you're sporting maybe an older board
or a single module and especially in
Premiere Pro the differences are pretty
substantial so what do you think are you
sporting a single channel config in your
own rig have you swapped out parts and
test it on your own let me know in the
comments below also something else to
note you'll find that single modules
they give you by just a single 8 gig
stick it's going to cost you a little
bit more than buying 2 for dig sticks
the reason why is because you could buy
a single 8 gig stick and then pair that
with like four other 8 gig sticks down
the line and then you can get 32 gigs
out of just four modules versus if you
buy 4 4 gig modules you're stuck with
only 16 if you have only 4 slots then
that's it you've maxed it out so you got
to sell your RAM and you got to buy
modules that have higher capacities so
that's why those are more expensive it's
not because they're better don't confuse
the two you buy two dims if you can if
you can buy 2 8 gig sticks 16 is plenty
for gamers it's even sufficient for
majority of content creators out there
I've rendered a lot with 16 gigs even
scrubbing the timeline isn't too bad
although having more is never really
gonna hurt in that case so just a little
bit of inside scoop there by the way
this video here still relevant I know
this is a couple of years old at least
but you'll be surprised by the number of
games you can get by with only 8 gigs of
DDR 4 or DDR 3 depends on the platform
so give it on a watch if you're
interested like this video without it
was cool
dislike it field and put opposite I got
to breathe oh I'm just speaking too fast
and I didn't I didn't think about taking
a breath there ok we're good
