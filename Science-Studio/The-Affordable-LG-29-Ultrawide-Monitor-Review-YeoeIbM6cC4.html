driver for just under a year now and I
have to say I am absolutely in love with
it it's been that way since day one now
it's been replaced by the LG 29 um 68 P
which you can find linked in this
video's description it's been enhanced
in some ways including the addition of
free sync but it's still available for
under 300 US dollars
I created a quick review of this monitor
several months ago and albeit shabby
quality so I say it's time to give it an
official proper review many of you have
asked for it so here it finally is a
review of the affordable 2560 by 1080 p
LG ultrawide monitor
this has got to be one of the most
affordable yet usable ultra-wide on the
market hands down and from a great brand
like LG I don't recommend a 25 inch
ultra wide the vertical dimension is too
narrow and for what I do in the desk
that I used a 34 inch ultra wide would
be too wide in the horizontal at this
form factor here just under 28 inches
wide including the frame mind you it
isn't quite so large that the edge hangs
off of my desk I will say however that
if you plan on using only one monitor
for everything a 34 inch would be
preferable just much much more expensive
this is definitely the budget conscious
choice and I condone that this monitor
isn't very thick either it slightly
bulges in the back but it's subtle and
still gives you the impression that it's
especially thin since the back is
contoured in this manner this one
doesn't include built-in speakers but
the 29 um 68 P does and from what I read
in the reviews they're excellent for
what they are the one I have includes
two HDMI ports a headphone jack for
audio running via HDMI and of course the
power port the frame of the monitor is
sleek shiny and made of plastic with a
bold LG logo dead center on the rear and
can be tilted back and forth a good ways
just not side to side via the included
rigid stand it holds the monitor upright
via two screws in the neck and four
screws at the base the front of the
monitor is a pleasant surprise while I
would normally shun plastic it doesn't
bother me because I can't see it shorts
on the bottom bar along with the subtle
LG logo but the bezels surrounding the
sides and the top of the display are
actually just matte finished
continuations of what would otherwise be
comprised of pixels this means you won't
see any annoying light reflecting off
the plastic which is good especially in
the dark below the front logo is a
single pivoting controller good for
selecting input modes and customizing
display settings brightness contrast
things of that sort it is a bit awkward
I would have preferred dedicated buttons
but at least it's available there isn't
much of a learning curve either and now
on to the display itself this is an IPS
display with a pixel resolution of 2560
by 1080 pixel density is a little over
90 PPI and an anti-glare matte finish
spans the entire panel matte finishes
aren't my thing usually but this one
isn't overkill and being that this
monitor sits directly in front of an
open window it comes in very handy
colors are crisp vibrant and relatively
accurate nothing close to full srgb but
for a matte finish
not bad and you won't notice washed out
colors in the same way you would on a
knockoff TFT panel blacks decently
contrast lighter zones remember this
isn't an OLED panel or anything close to
that but I will say that the backlight
is uniform and the bleed is very minimal
especially for a sub $300 monitor the
refresh rate of this monitor is a
standard 60 Hertz which is nothing
special it's run-of-the-mill but I will
say that I was able to overclock it very
easily to 75 Hertz and yes I can see a
difference more on that right here so
how about watching videos on an
ultra-wide will they take up the total
real estate offered in the 21 by nine
format well it depends honestly and my
personal experience most youtube videos
will not save ones that are customized
specifically for ultra wide resolutions
like this video when it comes to
watching movies whether it be online or
via DVD it's about 50/50 the format is
widescreen chances are the moving
picture will span the entire screen when
the window is maximized this widescreen
version of Iron Man is an example and I
must say movies are a joy to watch in
this resolution it feels immersive and
captivating in a way much more exciting
than the typical sixteen by nine aspect
now as for gaming it's going to depend
and I'll defer you to this video right
here for a more in-depth explanation of
that essentially some games will and
some games won't just depends on the
style of game whether it's new or old
for the most part any new game will run
in an ultra wide format no problem older
games and first-person shooters I've
found even games like overwatch or bit
quirky and will either stretch the image
or just cut off the top and bottom again
it depends on the game see that video
for more of an explanation now in terms
of content creation ultra whites are
100% the way to go take it from someone
like myself and if you're willing to
take the chance ultra rights will even
pay off when gaming it will ultimately
come down to preference but when you
consider the fact that a monitor like
this sells for under 300 bucks you
really won't be losing much you'll just
be gaining quite a bit of horizontal
real estate even if you already own a
1080p panel I would argue that upgrading
to just 1080 ultra wide is beneficial
and worth your while
if you liked this video be sure to give
it a thumbs up give it a thumbs down if
you looking feet and subscribe for more
content like this stay tuned for a
review of the G scale keyboard and mouse
combo as well as an aka racing chair
somewhere back there and don't forget
about our RAM test coming up very soon
compiling a bunch of data for that video
this is science 2
