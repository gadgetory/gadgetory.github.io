the point here fan text does excellent
jobs making cases that are affordable
and premium so this right here is a $60
enclosure and you get tempered glass
included I'd like you to meet the P 300
I know I'm a bit late with this review
everyone else released theirs earlier in
the day but this is a smaller take on
the P 400 from fan text which was
already a great value in fact a tempered
glass edition of that case was my
favorite case for the longest time up
until fractal released their defined C
tempered glass Edition so like I said
the P 300 has a smaller chassis than the
P 400 that's why it's a 300 not 400
also the basement is kind of like a part
of the chassis so you can see and feel
the basement on the exterior of the case
and the tempered glass actually only
goes down to where the basement begins
actually think it's pretty cool gives us
case a bit of flavor and definitely
distinguishes it from its competition
also being this is only a $60 enclosure
seeing tempered glass on board is
definitely a plus and no it's not extra
tinted it's just slightly tinted just
enough in my book in terms of hardware
support we're looking at ATX
motherboards and smaller only because
there is an indention here kind of like
the fractal defined C case that gives
more room in the back for cable
management cable storage in general I
think that this is a worthy compromise
most people aren't going to use EI TX
cases the few that do are always going
to make a big deal about how these cases
don't support ei TX but the fact of the
matter is a majority of people are using
a EXI as motherboards and smaller so I
don't see a problem going with the
better cable management in the back
speaking of which it's very clean back
here it's very easy to kind of maneuver
cables and store things that you really
don't need especially if you don't have
a modular power supply I love the space
in the p300 it's actually an easier case
to build in believe it or not than the P
400 regarding fan and radiator support
this actually takes on kind of like an
NZXT s340 vibe so you've got a single
120mm fan support in the back you have
up to a 140 millimeter fan on top only a
single one and it does have a dust
filter included just a little magnetic
one so at least there's that
that's something that the S 340 elite
does not include a
pretty sure and then up front here you
have support for up to a two hundred and
eighty millimeter AI oh I have a 240 in
there right now you can see there's
plenty of room still for a larger
radiator but you can't put a triple rat
in here and I'm about to show you why so
if you remove the front panel of the
case you'll find the hard drive tray
actually turns sideways so that you can
access your drive base from the front
this is actually pretty cool and at the
same time it does kind of cut into space
in the basement so I have a really large
power supply here actually there are
power supplies larger than this one on
the market but this one's considerably
larger than the average power supply for
a mid tier build and it will not fit
including the cable links there's no way
to get this power supply to fit in here
so I had to use a smaller form factor
power supply because the hard drive tray
was left intact if you want more space
down here you can remove the hard drive
tray of course though there's nowhere
else to put three and a half inch drives
keep in mind this is still considered a
mid tower case so there are seven PCIe
slots at the rear again that 120mm fan
rad support up top you have your
motherboard rear i/o cutout down below
just a simple power supply mounting
system no extra you know hinge or
anything like that to worry about here
just like your power supply in from the
right side of the case the p300 stands
firm on the ground with its four large
feet I'd say that's about an inch or so
of breathing room for the power supply
if you orient your fan downward and on
the bottoms of the feet you'll find
little foam pads to keep things from you
know getting scratched up on your desk
that's for front i/o the case is
sporting a headphone jack microphone
jack and two USB 3.0 ports I can't
really complain here it's a $60 case so
having the XP USB ports would have been
nice but at least you got some up here
also there is an RGB cycle button up
front which will change the color of the
power button up top as well as the thin
LED strip at the front of the case on
top of the basement
the p300 also includes extra wiring
harnesses if you want to attach some
compatible LED strips or even sync it up
with your motherboards lighting system
pretty cool how they've done this so if
you want a full on RGB build or just a
rig that is you know suiting one color
scheme then you can actually control it
all with this one button up top if you
really wanted I am a bit concerned about
the front panel this has always been fan
Texas Achilles heel so there are two
very tiny dust filters here and this is
basically reminiscent of how much
this case is gonna offer you at least
four fans up front there is another best
filter kind of integrated down here at
the base so there are dust prevention
mechanisms built into the front panel
but the front panel itself is rather
constricted I would say this is more
restrictive than the typical defined see
defined s from factored design also
maybe even slightly more restrictive
than the s340 elite because there are
these grill little slots here and it's
not just an open space for air to flow
through so this is probably the the most
inconvenient thing about the P 300 then
again it was also inconvenient for the P
400 snaps in nice and sturdy there are
two other issues I have with this case
at this point I'm just really being
picky because if you consider the $60
price tag this case is a huge bargain
I'm gonna recommend this case to anybody
looking for a relatively affordable case
it also includes some amenities like
tempered glass and RGB integration the
one thing that I'd like to see in with
the basement is a cutout for VGA cables
there's not one of those which means you
have to route your graphics card cables
through the slots at the rear where you
would funnily 24-pin at USB 3.0 and such
and that's the other thing I want to
complain about I'm not the biggest fan
of the way they've done this they're
angled at 90 degrees so the cutouts are
gonna make your cables look slightly and
I just crushed and constricted I've
liked we're seeing maybe a 45 degree
angle here or just simple cutouts facing
the right side of the case but I've got
to be honest in this regard as well this
is a huge bargain huge bargain for 60
bucks cannot stress that enough despite
the few downfalls that really I mean you
can't you can't chop this case for it's
60 bucks this is one heck of a bargain
I'm gonna recommend it to anybody
looking for a case that's not $100 this
is yeah this is probably the best case
of 60 bucks period and I say that with
confidence I haven't built in anything
this cheap that is this nice to build in
it's this easy to build it and that
looks this good either as always you can
find this product linked in the video
description along with this P 400
counterpart slightly large case but it
does offer a bit more breathing room for
custom loops in one I'd be pretty
difficult to fit a custom loop in here
you'd have to really cut back on
radiators and and things that are fairly
important for custom loops if you want
to support us on Amazon you can click
any of those links in buy products via
those links and that will give us a
small kickback and we do recycle most of
that money back
into the channel to bring more content
like this actually just went to Best Buy
and purchased about 500 bucks worth of
storage drive so it does really help us
out and it lets us build more pcs like
these and in cases that are as beautiful
as this one and frankly even more
beautiful for 60 bucks this is a great
case there are better cases out there
I'm gonna be honest but for 60 bucks
there is no better case that I've come
across that is this great of a bargain
if you liked this video be sure to give
it a thumbs up thumbs down for the
opposite click subscribe but if you had
already to stay tuned for more stuff
like this on the channel this is science
studio thanks for building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
