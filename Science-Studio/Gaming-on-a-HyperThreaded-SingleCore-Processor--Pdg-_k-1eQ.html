comments in part one I realize that
quite a number of you wanted a
single-core hyper-threaded simulation
and that is exactly what I've done here
this is part two of four where we
simulate a single core hyper-threaded
gaming experience you'll be surprised by
a thing or two in this one
okay so this time around we're going to
enable hyper-threading and reduce our
active processor cores down to one which
will essentially give us a single core
hyper-threaded CPU which is what a lot
of you were asking for in the comments
after part one so here you go folks
let's see if hyper-threading really
makes much of a difference here okay
folks so there you go so core zero and
core one so this is effectively a single
core processor with hyper-threading
enabled for a grand total of two threads
now I am going to open up battlefield
one and attempt to benchmark that game
it would not open with one core
activated but maybe with hyper-threading
we can change things up okay you can see
same exact settings as last time pretty
much everything on except for NSAA and
no advanced graphics here we go folks
let's let's see if this is any better
than last time
okay been waiting for I think nine
minutes now yep almost 10 minutes and
the benchmark is still loading
I mean like the first part of the
benchmark I haven't seen anything but
the loading screen for the past 9 to 10
minutes
hey we're actually we're not flying
through the ground like we were last
time quite a bit of frame stuttering I
notice up front but at least we're
following the jet through the air and
not on the street well I am very
impressed by how much of a difference
hyper-threading has made here keep in
mind folks this is with max settings -
MSAA you could actually play this game I
mean it's playable right now yeah you'll
have frame skipping every now and then
but you could play this okay maybe you
could play the game from in the air but
when it comes to playing on the street
it's probably not going to be yeah this
is this is pretty bad
explosion actually looked pretty good as
well
okay looks like a noticeable improvement
in city skylines as well so uh yeah
zooming in still absolutely destroys
frame rates but at least we're not
dipping down into single digits here as
you can see we're hovering around while
the mid-teens so 15 to 20 FPS when
zoomed all the way in and then zoom now
we're looking at around 30 to 40
especially when you're not staring
directly into the face of some dense
cities so another way you can tell you
we are definitely cpu-bound is by
analyzing the water transitions here so
this is very heavily physics-based and
typically this is a smooth experience
when all four pores and hyper-threading
are all activated but because we only
have one core we're seeing a lot of
micro stuttering going on it's not a
very fluid transition I like it
typically is and the fact that it's
raining in the game is making things
much worse so while this experience
still might be choppy and unenjoyable
especially when zoomed in we do have to
note a very substantial and noteworthy
improvement with the addition of hyper
threading so hyper threading in this
case makes a huge difference so I
imagine that the effects of hyper
threading might be scaled down as we
increase core count
pleasantly surprised by how quickly the
game loaded it took about 12 minutes the
first time but with hyper-threading
enabled only about a minute and a half
so the game is no longer skipping frame
to frame like it was with only one core
no hyper-threading you can see here
we're actually getting respectable frame
rates to staying around 30 for the most
part I'm just glad we no longer have to
record this game in seconds per frame we
can actually do this in frames per
second now I am shocked by how big of
the difference hyper-threading is making
in all these titles so remember we were
at point 1 FPS over here
I mean point 1 across the board it was
virtually zero frames per second now
we're getting 21.1 on the average and as
high as on the normal batches 30 FPS so
that's that's awesome so let's go ahead
and test out warhammer next and then I
guess we'll throw the rig at a
battlefield 1
the CPU is just struggling to get this
thing started
and there we go you know what it seems
like hyper-threading has corrected the
frame stutter issue we had in part one
so we had at least a 10 FPS boost
overall and you can tell just by looking
at this chart here our frame rates have
are just more consistent across the
board we didn't have the same frame drop
here that we had in part one I wonder
what goes on at that point but for
everything else just much more
consistent much more fluid and very
minimal frame stuttering this time
so a few even comments asked for a game
like csgo to be tested and that's
exactly what's about to happen here and
then I'm also going to restart the
computer turn off hyper-threading and
rerun the test to see if hyper-threading
makes that much of a difference in a
game like this okay so I do notice here
gameplay isn't as smooth as it was with
four cores and eight threads we're
probably not even maxing out the refresh
rate of our monitor but we are still
getting I assume well over 100 FPS here
I'm benchmarking right now in fraps so I
can't actually see the frame counter
okay so there's the frame counter up top
you see we're getting around 100 FPS
here and csgo with a single core and
hyper threading enabled so now let's see
if turning off hyper threading drops
those frames by any significant amount
and wrap the bat I can see that really
not much change we're still hovering
around 100 fps and this is with hyper
threading disabled so we're running on
just one core and one thread look at
still getting well okay some frames that
are here and they're still getting
roughly 100 FPS on average and this is
with everything maxed out in game
okay so we look to be doing okay here in
battlefield one every now and then we
get some weird artifact you saw that
right there
all in all right now I would say yeah
you can play battlefield one on a single
core CPU with hyper-threading enabled
long to get a solid frequency to back it
up and a good amount of l3 cache right
now fairly smooth I would be okay
playing this on a computer with a single
core
and there goes but as you can see see
you thirty frames per second that is not
bad if you'd have told me 30 minutes ago
the battlefield one would have reacted
in this manner to a single core
hyper-threaded process or I would have
laughed at you but I won't like this
even though these frame rates do deem a
game like this especially a new game
like battlefield one playable it still
goes to show you why we don't
manufacture single core chips for
desktop PCs anymore and while a lot of
the rendering and processing will be
done by the GPU in a game like this the
CPU still has to take care of a lot of
the physics calculations a lot of the
things rendered in the background I
handles things like viewing distance
changes so a lot of that is the
responsibility of the CPU and without a
CPU with multiple threads you will run
into some severe bottlenecks and
stuttering thanks to hyper threading in
this case we didn't see much of that
even in battlefield beta so with that
folks I want to hear if you were as
surprised as I was the differences
hyper-threading makes in games like
these these are relatively CPU intensive
saved like csgo but I mean for the most
part these are taxing on CPUs even 6600
KS and 6700 KS
quite high CPU usage is at 1440p so I
want to hear from you what you want to
see next in part 3 what kind of core
simulations you would like dual core or
dual core hyper-threaded three core I
don't know something weird we can do any
of that in part 3 it's up to you guys
let me know in the comments what you
want be sure to give this one a thumbs
up if you enjoyed it give that thumbs
