10 minutes like literally 10 freakin
minutes and he comes back and he's like
yeah dude I got good news and bad news
like good news is yeah does everything
powers all in bad news is it's your
graphics car you're gonna have to get a
new graphics bar of course there's hydro
x-series custom water cooling suite is
fitted with everything you need to build
something like this start with a
configurator plan your loop and choose
from stylish water blocks to clean
fittings copper rads to durable coolants
you know what actually can we cut back
to no not that one yeah this one yes yes
let's just let's all stare at this for a
second
Wow I've got one of these kits on hand
and I cannot wait to build with it you
can find it all from Coursera via the
link below this might look like an
ordinary gaming PC and that's because it
is there's nothing wrong with it
we use it every day in fact this is the
machine that my brother uses quite a bit
so what we're going to do is take this
to Best Buy particularly the each squad
and have them diagnose it now if there's
nothing wrong with it what are they
gonna diagnose we're going to do a
little something to this to make it not
work anymore and the point of this is to
see if they have the knowledge and the
skill set to be able to properly
troubleshoot a build like this now we're
not gonna do anything super crazy to it
all I'm going to do is unplug a single
cable now it would be super obvious to
unplug something on this side in fact
they'd probably think it was a joke and
like we were trying to mess with them I
want to give you guys an informed
decision about whether or not you should
fix this yourself send it to somebody
else maybe you just don't have a time of
day to troubleshoot your own PC so
you're considering bringing it in to
somebody who should you bring it into
that's what this video will seek to
answer is Geek Squad a viable option for
you especially when the problem has a
super simple solution so what we're
going to do is not unplug anything on
this side because again that's too
obvious I'm swinging around here I know
you're not gonna go see this we'll give
you a second shot here in a second I'm
going to unplug a single cable that
connects on the power supply side to the
PCI supplemental power on the
ethics car now I do have to turn the
power supply over to effectively do this
because the VGA power cables on the
power supply are sitting right in front
of the right side panel so we wanted to
be further tucked back we want them to
have to actually thoroughly troubleshoot
this rig in order to figure out what is
wrong with it my suspicion is that they
are going to assume it's the graphics
card itself and not a power supply cable
now we're gonna tuck it back in and I'm
gonna show you what Geek Squad is going
to see when they power on this PC I
believe is going to happen is you will
just see a black screen if PC will turn
on but you will not get a picture on
your monitor and this is going to I
suspect leave them to assume that it's a
graphic card issue and the cool thing is
we'll be able to see what they say our
problem is but we'll know in the back of
our heads what the actual problem is
because we created it okay so just to
recap this is what happens when you turn
on the PC before we take it to the Geek
Squad it looks like it turns on all the
lights are lighting up and even the fans
are spinning hard drive spinning you see
we're plugged into the monitor but
nothing no post in fact yeah dr. D bug
disappeared as well so there's there's
literally no indication that anything is
wrong at all and the only thing we've
done is unplugged the Supplemental eight
pin power connector on the power supply
side that's all let's take it there and
see if they can figure out what we did
to it all right guys so I just went
picked up this PC here on Craigslist for
some reason as you can see I can't pick
up a picture I have no idea what's going
on so my only source right now since I
have no idea what I'm doing is to go to
Geek Squad and see if they can save me a
couple dollars all right so we're at our
local Best Buy sorry about the trash
audio I'm using my mobile phone here
Kyle's got the PC and it's just been
kind of sitting in his lap the whole
time I'm not worried about the air
anyway what's your story wait pretend
I'm the Geek Squad yeah what are you
gonna say hi so I picked this bad boy up
here off Greg
list you know I was looking for a decent
PC around eight nine hundred bucks
looking to mine some Bitcoin with it but
you know I took it home after paying the
dude tried to plug it in got no picture
got nothing don't know what's going on
so I said it just trashing it trying to
reach out to go I'm just gonna take it
to Geek Squad see if they can do
something for so okay make sure you
emphasize that it powers on and
everything lights up but you got no
picture to your monitor powers on
everything lights up no picture okay I
tried reaching out to the guy Craigslist
couldn't find them wouldn't answer his
phone so probably knew something is
wrong with it yeah so here we go so at
this point we had to get creative
because Florida wiretapping laws
prevented us from straight-up walking in
there and filming and secrecy this is a
two-party consent state after all and
we're on private property this isn't
like a public part or something like
that so to illustrate what went on
inside Best Buy between Kyle and the
Geek Squad rep I put together a discount
animation next time we'll make sure to
do this in a state where one party
consent exists anyway here we go what's
up man so I just picked it up on
Craigslist I plugged it in there sound
the light comes on but no picture I
don't know what's wrong did you plug
your monitor into your card here mm-hmm
yeah I even watched youtube videos make
sure I was connecting everything
correctly but still no picture okay let
me see if I can take it in the back here
and see what I can find
well I've got good news and bad news
ah the good news is the rest of your
computer works fine
bad news is it's bad graphics card I
took out the graphics card and plugged
it up with onboard and it's running just
fine so how much would it be to replace
a graphics card well do you know where
you got it from now I just reached out
to him on Craigslist and of course he
won't return my calls anymore that ms
our card may still be under warranty
there's a serial number you can
reference and they may replace the card
if it's relatively new but this one here
isn't working anymore well I'm gonna
make a tag for this there's no charge
just helps me keep track of work I've
done on my end by the way are you
related to Greg
no I get asked that a lot apparently
he's some youtuber or something okay
well look man you're free to go honestly
your best bet is to try and contact MSI
and see if they can RNA that card with
the serial number and that in a nutshell
is what happened we really wish we could
have filmed inside but we don't want to
be sued twice that was so sad I think it
over so I gave up mine and then the
first thing he asked us are you related
to Corrections like brown I was like
velvet I was like a lot of people always
ask me that and he was like oh yeah man
went to school then I was like
apparently something like youtuber or
something so they were back there with
it for like ten minutes
like literally ten freakin minutes and
he comes back and he's like yeah dude I
got good news and bad news like good
news is yeah it does everything powers
on bad news is it's your graphics car
you gonna have to get a new graphics
card so they didn't even I guess try to
take anything out there take the back
piece off they just try to plug it in
plug in the monitor and they call it a
day right yeah did they try to charge
you no hit when they took it back and
looked at he was like it wasn't his free
to just look at yourself
okay well at least I didn't charge you
for it thankfully so to recap then this
is what Best Buy essentially told Kyle
they said that the rest of the computer
was good the rest of the computer worked
they know that because they plug the
HDMI cable into the motherboards HDMI
out which means they were running off of
integrated graphics and the system
posted fine the graphics card on the
other hand was not outputting a signal
and they very quickly diagnosed the
issue as a dead card it wasn't a dead
graphics card it was a perfectly fine
card in fact it lit up the fans even
turned you just weren't getting picture
sometimes you can have dead cards that
look like that but a lot of the time if
it's getting power and it seems like it
should be working there's probably
something very simple just like dumb
simple to to address and in this case it
was dumb simple it was a plug to power
cable except it wasn't obvious for them
it wasn't unplugged on my graphics card
side it was unplugging the power supply
side so what do I think of Geek Squad
well just based off with this one
attempt I've never taken anything into
Geek Squad before I wouldn't recommend
that you take anything into Geek Squad
especially if you built your own PC you
probably know it better than they do
because every PC - it don't extend is
different you know maybe different cases
different okay for the most part they're
gonna be the same but I don't know I'm
trying to give them the benefit of the
doubt I don't want to outright roasty
each one and they didn't charge Kyle
anything that's a good a good takeaway
from this is that like if they can't
figure out what it is or if they figure
out what it is and it's a very simple
you know diagnosis then they probably
won't charge you at least they didn't
for Kyle and that's that's nice I would
have been pretty upset if they had
charges 250 bucks or a hundred bucks to
just tell us that our graphics card is
dead that we needed to buy another one
for 400 bucks that wouldn't have been
pretty but ultimately this comes back to
attention to detail and DIY if you are
more familiar with your PC than someone
else's chances are you can diagnose it
better than they can and if they're
seeing a dozen or so pcs a day and
they're used to simple solutions they're
probably not gonna look for things that
aren't just blatantly obvious to them
which is why I chose to unplug the PCIe
cable and the power supply said because
it was tucked away underneath the
basement you would have had to have
removed the power supply or pulled it
out to notice that the cable was
detached that's all they had to do they
didn't do it because either they wanted
to rush and move on to somebody else or
they just they didn't know how to
thoroughly troubleshoot the more you
know the better off you'll be and that's
why we make videos like these in this
channel that's why other tech tubers
make videos like these it's because we
are trying to help you guys first off
make informed purchase decisions but
also we're trying to save you money okay
and and if it's a simple issue and
you've just taken two or three minutes
to troubleshoot you probably would have
noticed that
it was a simple solution not always the
case I mean the grandmas skirt could
have been dead and if it was dead then
they would have diagnosed it correctly
but in this case it wasn't so again I
just keep going back to the idea that
like they're they're telling him to buy
a new card like when you when you tell
them it's a TED graphics card that's
like that's not an easy purchase for a
lot of people to swallow that's 2 300
bucks typically if not more if we had
thrown a 22 TI and there 8 is told us to
buy another 1200 dollar graphics card
that's an entire system in and of itself
so I don't know I will say kudos to Kyle
Kyle did a great job that's my younger
brother for those who don't know he also
filmed all of our footage at Computex
this year that's a big thanks to him you
guys can check out his channel I linked
it down below if you're just a shows
vlogs and stuff like that so if you want
to know what goes on behind the scenes
with him someone related to me you can
check that out you can also check out
our second channel which is where I just
kind of sit in front of the camera and
talk about day-to-day life my personal
stuff if you guys want to know more
about me and now you can watch that
channel it's very small but it is fun
it's fun to just sit in front of the
camera and ramble for a few minutes
thanks for watching stay tuned for part
two of this I didn't mention this before
but we're going to take that PC that
Geek Squad misdiagnosed to a small
mom-and-pop shop that specializes in
computer repair cell phone repair things
of that sort we're gonna see if they can
figure out what is wrong with the system
it's gonna be the exact same issues
before Kyle's gonna stick to the same
story and yeah we'll see how it goes
thanks for watching everyone gonna
thumbs up if you thought it was cool but
there is a subscribe button you know
what to do all the good stuff I will
catch you in the next one this is
science video thanks for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
