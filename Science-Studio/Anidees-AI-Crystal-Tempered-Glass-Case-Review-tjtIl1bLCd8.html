car in some cases it's the only part of
the computer you'll see in other cases
and I'm using the word case in the non
literal sense here even if they have
large side panels the case is still the
first thing that you'll likely notice
you'll typically see the goodies inside
after the fact so it's not very often
then that a case literally forces you to
notice the inside first I've already
reviewed the entha proem acrylic but I
believe I found something in a similar
form factor that is eons better the
entity's AI crystal what entities yep
that's right they're a fairly unnoticed
company in the PC case market but I have
a feeling this case will change things
up for them let's take a tour the Vox
Dei crystal came in was standard in size
and to my surprise getting all dr. Susi
here the word fragile was labeled
nowhere on the box why would I be
concerned about this well check this out
three of the crystals panels are made
entirely out of tempered glass yes you
heard me correctly folks glass
nonetheless the case was completely
intact and the soft foam kept the panels
together upon first glance the case
didn't appear too large or too small at
475 by 216 by 497 millimeters this puts
the crystal just under the N throw pro
acrylic size and as soon as we can deal
over that of my previous case the
Corsair 400 C nonetheless great size and
great space the glass panels are held in
place by four support screws each with
an included rubber washer to prevent
unwanted scratching a nice touch at
first glance I did notice that the glass
was tinted although a great deal of
light still manages to make its way out
of the case if you plan on illuminating
the goodies with a series of LED strips
the AI crystal is very water cooler in
custom Lube friendly as well supporting
two three hundred sixty millimeter
radiators one up front and one on top
you can include both by the way the same
time however entities includes three 140
millimeter fans up front to begin with
and a single 140 in the rear nice added
touches sing as though most cases only
include one or two fans nowadays what
shame the fans themselves also house
white LEDs which I'll reveal towards the
end of this review the basement of the
case spans from the back to up within 65
millimetres of the front meaning that as
long as your fan radiator combo is a
six centimetres thick or less you'll
have plenty of snuggle room for a 360
millimeter Twitter an 80 millimeter
station below or anything smaller than
that the top of the case is also
radiator friendly I was able to squeeze
my 280 millimeter add up top along with
two 140 millimeter fans without a hitch
plenty of clearance for a full sized ATX
motherboard below speaking of which the
chassis includes integrated mounting
screws a plastic cable shroud that also
includes a secret second function more
on that in a second a large grounded
cable slot on the ceiling of the
basement and seven PCI expansion slots
extended power supplies will fit below
protected by a removable dust filter and
contrary to other early reviews I've
read in regards to this case sticking
with a non modular power supply
shouldn't be a problem as there's
adequate space between a typical PSU and
the hard drive cage this cage supports
two three and a half inch hard disk
drives or two solid-state drives there
is screw support for both and all
required screws can be found in the
included accessory box along with a few
tight wraps PSU and motherboard screws
I was also pleasantly surprised by the
inclusion of an integrated fan hub
supporting up to five fans Wow
all of which can be controlled by a
switch up top with low high and off
presets and don't worry the lows are
very low I can't hear the fans when
they're operating at this preset high on
the other hand is the opposite story but
that is to be expected
no complaints for me here further
towards the front of the right panel
you'll also find a few velcro straps
always a great addition and saying is
that this panel is also tempered glass
keeping your cables and check back here
is in my opinion of requirement no one
wants to see that mess so make it look
pretty ish the front panel which is also
layered with tempered glass is removable
giving way to a large removable dust
filter let's fans the entire front end
airflow appears to be satisfactory
although the air filter is a bit on the
thick side so in this case it's either
go big or go home if it's the former
dust will not be an issue there's also a
dust filter up top I use it even with my
exhausting radiator to prevent dust from
falling back into the case through the
exposed section closer towards the front
building inside the AI crystal was a
breeze I had about as much room as I did
in the entha Pro M acrylic and
significantly more space than I had in
the Corsair Ford and C by the way I'm
comparing those two cases to this one
not because of price or anything like
that but because all
these cases appear to have the inside of
the computer in mind so all three have
very large windows whether they be made
out of acrylic or in this case tempered
glass all in all I was 100% satisfied
with the end result Q the tech porn
you
so if you didn't notice up front that
removable white panel which I painted
white by the way it comes in black
normally is actually a graphics card
support as well and let me explain what
I mean by that without even knowing what
was going on when I inserted my 980ti
the PCB of the card slipped perfectly
into the top narrow groove of the shield
and now no graphics card sag absolutely
none folks I think I'm in love if you're
not a fan of the fans maybe the LED
layouts or transparent chassis is no big
deal swap these out with your choices
I'm just a fan of the fact that they
included four of them the two bottom
LEDs and my rear fan were dead out of
the box but I've got a white fan I plan
on placing there anyway now my favorite
case up until this point and I've made
no secret of it see this video right
here has been the fan Tech's Eclipse
p400 and I've got to say it's still a
great bargain but what I'll also say is
this for currently 140 US dollars I saw
it on sale at one point for 99 bucks
actually a few days ago it's one of the
cheapest tempered glass cases you can
currently buy and with added benefits a
fan hub velcro routing graphics card
anti-sag technology and plenty of
uninterrupted space you likely won't be
left with that sour taste in your mouth
after purchasing and building in a
budget-friendly counterpart consider the
real deal consider the entity's AI
crystal it's worth every single penny
I'll have a link to the case in the
description of this video I typically
only use Newegg and Amazon when I post
links to products that I showcase here
on the channel so when it does become
available on Amazon I'll have that link
listed as well also be sure to check out
their website and its own website where
they showcase their own case keeps
saying case in these kinds of videos I
need a competent work and I'll tower
maybe something like that
throw a suggestion in the comments I'll
check them out maybe consider using that
word instead of case over and over and
over if you liked what you saw this
video you see coming folks give it that
thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
feel the complete opposite or if you
hate everything about life be sure to
click the subscribe button you haven't
already and stay tuned for a video
detailing the differences between
DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 what exactly
DirectX is what an API is and how it
helps game developers develop games stay
tuned for next one folks this is science
studio thanks for learning with us
