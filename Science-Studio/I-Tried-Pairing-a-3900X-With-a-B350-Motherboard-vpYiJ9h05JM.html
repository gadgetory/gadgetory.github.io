motherboard vendor and BIOS pages so for
particularly boards that I happen to
have on hand like the fatality a be 350
gaming K for I have that one in a closet
so this is a potential victim I don't
know but I'm just checking boards that I
have to see if any of them support then
two out of the box or with a BIOS update
well obviously not out of the box but
yeah well the BIOS flash can we get
these to work with Zen to I actually
found a thread on reddit that mentions
some vendor supporting a320 which is
definitely not officially supported by
AMD they told us that explicitly a
comput X that there was gonna be no
official support for the a320 chipset on
the news and two chips and for obvious
reasons a320 is a very very bare-bones
chipset and usually power delivery on
those boards is crap but I found a
gigabyte BIOS the f40 BIOS for the a320
em-dash s2h which I have actually will
has it I'm gonna go get it from will so
I can run these tests and apparently
apparently and they just updated this on
June 28th you have support for third gen
Rison CPUs in this latest BIOS if that's
the case then we can try to run our 12
core 24 thread 3900 X on a $40.00
motherboard I'll have to get that I
don't know if I'm gonna include that in
this video but I know I can do for sure
right now because I have this board here
is flash the latest asrock BIOS on to
the a be 350 gaming k4 and see if we can
get a fully stable functioning system
with our 12 core packed into it so yeah
let's give that a shot
so first let's talk about why a beefy
vrm setup is preferable to one that is
miniscule to say the least the first
variable to consider is temperature V
RMS will get extremely hot and typically
motherboard manufacturers will design
their vrm arrays around heat sinks like
this one here that you're saying that
has integrated fins wrapping all the way
around the vrm stacks and that's
actually really nice it increases
surface area contact to the air so that
he can dissipate faster boards like
these are meant to run 12 course 16 core
chips overclocked for long amounts of
time under heavy load scenarios and you
want beefy vir v RMS to be able to
deliver that power in a stable manner
you want as little voltage ripple as
possible they can handle higher power
workloads so more current and they're
gonna get hot but vor modules designed
to handle higher workloads for longer
amounts of time can typically handle the
heat a bit better
cheap v RMS and cheap MOSFETs will get
extremely hot very fast even under small
workloads and that tends to be what you
find on some cheaper chipsets especially
a320 chipsets
as for this azrog board here things are
definitely stripped down I expect V RMS
and MOSFETs will run harder and we're
gonna measure those temperatures as
we're configuring the 12 core assuming
we can get it to work with this BIOS
there's also a few extra steps we need
to do this isn't just a normal BIOS
flash according to Azeroth so we're
gonna follow the steps on the website
just to be safe and then we'll see if we
can even boot into our operating system
with the 12 core installed that would be
the first victory and the second victory
would be overclocking we're gonna try
overclocking although I should note that
most zen 2 processors will benefit from
not overclocking just enable precision
boost overdrive and your bios and you'll
be fine all I should say though with
this board here this particular chipset
you're not gonna have PBO I'm you're
just gonna have precision boost and
accept par which I'm not sure how those
are gonna if I was said to so we'll see
this is just one thing experiment
hopefully if anything your morbid
curiosities are satisfied alright so
right now I've got a 1700 X in here and
that's because you do need a compatible
CPU the BIOS in question in order to
flash a new BIOS you can't boot into
your powers without a CPU in most cases
so what we have in there again 1700 I
have the 3900 X is cooler the stock will
are actually on top of that and we're
going to go ahead and start it jump it
right here well there we go
as rakhal's there's instant flash you'll
see em flash from MSI you'll see Q flash
I believe from gigabyte I want to say
that's a they're all called different
things but basically it's utility built
into the BIOS to update itself and as
long as you have I just totally missed
my window to get into the as long as you
have the extracted BIOS folder in the
thumb drive that's plugged into your
motherboard you should be able to flash
it without a hitch so let's try that
again
okay so this took a little while I
actually had to kind of troubleshoot and
test out a few different configs here
asrock does not mention anything about
needing to update to a p5 bios before
updating a p5 point eight the issue is I
updated a p3 point four you can see here
and when I did that P five point eight
wasn't showing up in the instant flash
tool so that told me that whatever BIOS
we were running was not recent enough to
detect or allow us to flash the latest
five point eight bias so I tried 5.0 I
tried five point four five point four
works this was the latest a GSA update
the the actually I think the BIOS update
after this was for pinnacle Ridge I
didn't use that BIOS i just used five
point four and now we have five point
eight showing up so if you're doing this
with this exact board I guess this is
the order of operations if you have a
very old BIOS that was pretty loud
thunder out there and I click enter
we're gonna flash this BIOS now and then
hopefully our motherboard will be
prepped for our 12th core 3900 X all
right so the BIOS flash successfully we
hit okay so I'm gonna reboot I'm gonna
boot into the bin the operating system
just to be on the safe side especially
with this kind of BIOS it's more
experimental and I just I want to make
sure the system stable first and then
once that is confirmed then we're going
to turn the PC off we're gonna swap the
1700 X I have in here for the
3,900 X and see if we can even get it to
post and it post then we'll run a few
other tests will try manually
overclocking I remember we don't have
precision boost to on these older
chipset boards so we're gonna have a few
issues more than likely with Ram we're
also gonna have a few issues with the I
guess equivalent of turbo boost right so
when the max boost on the 3900 ax is
advertised at what 4.6 gigahertz when I
got really hot when you when you see
that on the Box that's if you're running
it with a board that natively supports
the chip or the BIOS update in this case
though I'm not too sure if we're gonna
get those max boost clocks if we don't
then manually overclocking would be a
viable option but then we also have to
consider the fact that the RM mosfet
configure on this board is not
technically enough virtue of course cpu
at 105 watt TDP so what we'll see it is
gonna be so weird running a 500 well for
ya with 499 to $500 CPU in a sub $100
motherboard just it'd be really strange
I always want to give these a little
twist before you lift them because
sometimes actually more times than not
in my experience the CPU will stick to
the cooler and you'll end up ripping it
out of the socket while it's latched
okay
reapply thermal compound of course let's
go ahead and swap this out you know if
I'm being completely honest I don't even
think this is gonna work I would be very
surprised if this PC even posted and I'm
not expecting much in the way of
overclocking Headroom I mean maybe we
can hit the frequencies we want around
4.2 gigahertz all 12 cores
but we might have some super toasty
prm's in response to that on this board
so is it all that viable No do I
recommend you do this
no I just feel like I need to say that
again all right you guys are gonna see
this at the same time I do if it works
it works if it doesn't well at least we
tried
so let's jump it
and hope that it posts why is that fan
not turning what's up
help you there it goes okay if it posts
gonna be awesome would be good news man
stops again
seems like it's power cycling I don't
think it's I don't think it's going
anywhere
Oh hope you have a post is he gonna do
anything else I don't know well let's
see let's see I think it just just
powered off again
alright just give it a few give it a few
tries see if anything happens
it's trying so hard it really is there
hope there goes got little rotating
spheres actually posted awesome I'm not
gonna edit any of that what you just saw
you're gonna see all that straight up so
it rebooted at least five times to get
this thing to stick and now we have a
black screen nope okay maybe it's just a
video driver I didn't reinstall windows
and we made the CPU swap so that might
be for other reasons why Wow so a 12
core CPU working on a be 450 board
that's something it's not something that
aim be officially said they were gonna
support they left it in the hands of the
vendors and so yeah they're basically
just saying as raw a gigabyte Asus MSI
if you guys want to support these CPUs
and your older motherboards by all means
be our guest but it's on you
we're not gonna force you obviously to
support them and so it's just up to
whether or not these vendors are gonna
be good guys and grandfather you in if
you have an older board like this and if
you have a a cheaper board as well like
this a be 350 gaming K for from as
Rock'em again not recommending you guys
throw 12 core CPUs into these
motherboards but maybe something like a
3600 would be totally viable for this
and we'll have to test to be sure but I
have a good feeling when it's a 60 watt
 65 watt TDP chip but it should it
should be fine on a board like this it
wouldn't be optimal but it still should
be fine you get a tinker of it with RAM
and stuff it's gonna be a bit harder on
the older chipset but still possible so
if you don't want to upgrade your
motherboard right away but you still
ones then - there are some boards out
there that support it and you're gonna
have to do some weird things and flash
multiple biases to work up to the one
that supports that your CPU more than
likely like what I had to do in this
video all right now I don't really want
to run through my entire benchmark suite
see if this is stable what I will do
though is open up i-264 engineer and see
first off how well the stock 3900 X
coolers gonna do and cooling the chip
but we're also gonna check the vrm temps
about well as much as we can on this boy
I'm sure there aren't many sensors on it
but we will see if it opens up there we
go
and all right so you can see all 24
sorry I know that glare is pretty bad
I can drop the ISO here we go no wrong
way yeah that's better
sorry about that okay so all 24 threads
and all 12 coarse and right now looks
like they it looks like they're boosting
do around 4.25 gigahertz is it la is it
overclocked to 4.2 maybe my overclock
that doesn't make sense
maybe my overclock stuck from before
which in which case I'd be worried about
temps looks like temperatures right now
are pretty stable 37 see main board I'm
not sure where these temp sensors are
it's gonna be it's gonna be difficult to
check vrm temps I will say that I could
probe them but it's not gonna be a very
reliable gonna read a lower temperature
but anyway let's just run out of 64 and
see if we have a stable stable system
here so I'm gonna open up system
stability test and so I'm gonna
obviously you guys can see and let's
just stress this CPU okay we do have vrn
looks like we have vrm temps up here I'm
not sure if those are reliable or not
but I'm gonna leave it up here and we'll
just see what happens so I'm gonna click
start now stressing everything CP
related to the CPU FPU and system cache
like start and system got pretty loud
but see how temps do ok so while this is
running here and sorry that system is
pretty loud obviously it's a thunder
full load or near full load you can see
that current frequencies for all 12
cores
I can scroll I can't scroll down anyway
most of these are around 4 gigahertz and
that's still above the base frequency
now there
there are obviously going to be issues
to hash out with biases and and in
certain conflicts and software that will
prevent these from boosting all the way
up to what they should be especially per
core but I'd say this is still fairly
decent considering what we're you know
are certain scenarios that would that
were in right now temperatures 62
degrees Celsius right now on the CPU
that's pretty good um for you know just
a stock run with the stock cooler and
yeah I'm pretty sure RV
I think our BRM temps are wrong I will
say though one of the one of the things
I would stress especially if you have a
board that doesn't doesn't technically
support 12 cores out of the box or even
eight cores and overclocking for that
matter get a top flow cooler like the
AMD stock cooler because it'll push air
down on to the V RMS and will cool them
off significantly better than say an a
IO or just kind of letting them
passively radiate heat so yeah I mean it
works and look this speaks volumes about
the platform I'm really impressed that
that this even booted up to be honest
and that was the whole point of this
video I just wanted to see if it would
work I wanted to find a motherboard in
the closet that I had that was a b3
Series board that had a supposed to
leaves into supported by us out there
after akka did it they proved that it
works and there I mean that's good
now do I recommend this setup here
obviously not like this is like a worst
case scenario
I recommend again a top flow cooler so
you can actively or at least someone
actively cool your VRMs because this is
these are pretty toasty I will say that
and I just stopped the stress test but
nothing severely alarming at least up
front and how often are you gonna fully
stress your CP let's be real so it works
if you're curious it's really gonna
depend on the vendor asrock made it work
here and there even some instances of
like a a320 boards again working I'm
gonna try that out in the next video we
also have our official horizon 9 3900 X
review coming out so stay tuned for that
I just while I'm compiling a bunch of
data because there's a ton there's like
20 graphs in that video I wanted to kind
of fool around and see if this works and
I also wanted to be one of the first to
actually try it so hopefully you haven't
seen this before if you have oh well I
mean least you have
second take on this and yeah let me know
in the comments what you think you guys
like this video if you appreciated that
I don't know the morbid curiosity I had
for this chipset and support give this
video like that would be appreciated and
I will catch you in the next one
more experimenting to do we got lots of
stuff I'm gonna try to possibly cool the
3700 X with a passive CPU cooler that'll
be interesting and a few more
experiments along with our official
reviews again the 3900 X as well as Navi
the 5700 and the 5700 x2 stay tuned for
those this is science video thanks for
watching and thanks for what am I gonna
say here thanks for ya thanks for
learning with us I totally butchered
that ending but I'm not gonna cut it
whatever
