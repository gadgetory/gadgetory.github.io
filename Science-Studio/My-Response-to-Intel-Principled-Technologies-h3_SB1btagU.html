incompetence on behalf of the blue team
now I'm not even gonna blame principal
technologies here they're testing
methodologies were vastly askew
enabling XMP profile only some of the
platform's tested ultimately crippling
AMD's infinity fabric dependencies using
stock AMD coolers but allowing Intel
counterparts to run on beefy noxious
because that's fair originally testing
the 2700 X in game mode this was a
burning sack of garbage but when we
understand the context here what truly
went on behind the scenes you can't help
but pass the blame to Intel they paid
for this report this was a commission
based review principal technologies put
together and the problem I have with it
is to full not necessarily that they
paid PT but that one the negligence of
PT went virtually unchecked by the
commissioning party is both parties at a
plane here but I think Intel is like the
last step here and then to said party
proceeded to publish the study anyway
knowing very well that the results were
askew they were very wrong in fact some
benchmarks were so obviously incorrect
that if you know anything about any
relatively new hardware I mean that I
can't see how this could go unchecked
it's it's so blatantly obvious that it's
either gross negligence or it's outright
fraud oh and by the way Intel just Damus
independent reviewers the middle finger
all right so here's my beef and we're
gonna be as ideologically consistent as
possible here because I've been playing
devil's advocate for quite a while with
this story it's part of the reason why I
haven't published anything to date that
with the hurricane also back things up
but this is the original article here
now I want you to put aside any notion
regarding bias and whether or not this
was paid for let's pretend this was an
independent review by say a popular tech
YouTube but let's use grind from techie
a city in an example at first glance
nothing looks too weird I mean that's
what I immediately thought when I first
came across it now just to be clear this
is an extremely thorough report right 23
pages in total and probably more
comprehensive than most if not all
benchmarks you'll find on the web they
paid attention to the finest detail save
a few instances for example GTA 5
settings
you know the data is completely omitted
here for some reason but it's laid out
it's extensively actually transparently
and nearly every other case they show
step by step benchmarking techniques
especially in scenarios for which no
built-in benchmarks exist this was the
case for pub G so the fact is you guys
take for granted the fact that we
objectively report our findings and we
do so with the information that we have
at hand because we aren't paid to say
what we say in these reviews and we
aren't paid to unfairly compare products
from different companies for example we
would never compare in 8700 K or 9900 K
to a 2,700 X with game mode enabled this
feature was designed to bypass issues
pertaining to thread Ripper CPUs so in a
numr non-uniform memory access config
the operating system can isolate the to
die controllers directly link to the
memory channels to reduce corresponding
latency and that's a big issue in
general with horizon so in a case of
games certain titles suffer roughly 5%
or so framerate disparities when TR CPUs
baked in their native states which is
why this new milega c mode was
implemented in the horizon master
utility but in the case of the 2700 X
legacy mode can severely cripple the
chip by effectively cutting its core
count in half I mean in the case of
let's say ashes of the singularity PT
revealed a nearly 50% margin which is
absolute BS I mean my own testing in
this exact same configure build a frame
rate nearly about 50 is about 52 which
is actually almost on par with the 8700
K and this is more or less than a MV
title so we shouldn't be too surprised
we aren't accusing PT of being paid off
by the way we're not saying they're
intentionally skewing results but we
don't expect them to be completely
clueless with regard to the settings
they're enabling I mean if Intel hired
them in the first place they've got to
know kind of what they're doing right
and maybe not so case in point the
horizon 2700 X is one heck of a
competitor for the blue team and they
know it
which is why I expected Intel in all
reality to fall back on this a gross
negligence apology tour but no you see
when Principal technologies was
initially called out on this they went
back to the drawing board and retested
with game mode off and they've had
several subsequent tests to fix quite a
number of things now but at least they
acknowledge the mistake I like that but
Intel put out a statement along the
lines of you know the data is consistent
with what we have seen in our labs
they're referring to the initial PT
report by the way which was the one that
was complete garbage this all ties back
to the issue with paid or commissioned
reviews to begin with I'm questioning
the integrity all around from the until
at this point I've never worked with
them directly so I have no you know
hands-on first-person experience with
their marketing strategies although
apparently people have been told weird
things in the past but I'm willing to
say this that's it just a shady shameful
move now I'm not referring by the way to
the benchmarks themselves to be
completely honest we see this garbage
all the time right NVIDIA tried to pull
a fast one with the way in which they
presented their r-tx cards I call that
crap out right when I saw it and look
what we have now lackluster performance
from an expensive generation of GPUs
when you're willing to omit entire axes
from your data we've got a problem
you're probably trying to hide something
that's what a lot of us were saying but
when you're willing to pay someone else
to review this stuff and then stand
behind blatantly fraudulent and or
negligent data your double layering the
academic dishonesty dumptruck my friend
look when these companies pay for work
you'd better believe they want it done a
certain way so I find it difficult to
believe that Intel simply approached
this company that who I haven't heard of
to date until now said hey we'll pay you
for these benchmarks and yet we'll see
you next week with results and then just
walked away with the metaphorical sealed
envelope in hand that's a joke these
companies especially the big ones want
control that's what they're paying for
afterall and that's the problem with
commissioning a series of benchmarks to
push out to the community before any of
us the independent reviewer base can get
our hands on them and review them
without breaking an embargo you're
inviting unwelcome scrutiny to the table
which that's not all necessarily bad but
you're calling it question your own
integrity at the same time and that's
why I started this entire thing with a
hypothetical pretend this was a report
by your favorite youtuber again I was
sticking with Brian from techie city
just because I love Brian he's a good
guy so some of these benchmarks may not
have looked all that strange certainly
the ashes of the singularity test and
we'd have called them out on it right
away relating it to someone intentional
error and the game settings or BIOS
config we would have blamed negligence
Brian would have gone back and fixed his
mistakes and that would have been the
end of it but if we suddenly found out
that Brian was paid by Intel to perform
these tests
we might attribute the odd benchmarks of
something other than a slip-up that's my
point that's why money being mixed up in
reviews like these especially ones that
go in front of independent reviews it's
just a big issue in my book principal
technologies will struggle to regain its
integrity in the gaming community I
imagine and for good reason I mean
there's nothing wrong with taking money
from a company for Commission based
project but the way in which they ran
the test shows that either a they don't
know what they're doing or B they
intentionally did what they did which
would be a bigger no-no and that they're
willing to work with a company as
disgusting as Intel at a time like this
when AMD is right on their heels
I mean arguably AMD's in the lead from a
value perspective so Intel feels the
pressure also assuming we do contribute
these issues to gross negligence overall
which I don't have a problem doing why
did they Commission them in the first
place why wouldn't they just send these
CPUs to reviewers earlier in the
schedule or how about this why even pay
a company to assess these products at
all by the way I don't have 99 hundred K
or 99 hundred x samples sitting here I
don't get anything Everett from Intel
directly I usually get things from other
core manufacturers and I don't even have
stuff from them so I can't even confirm
those aspects of the PT report but what
I can tell you is that based on what I
know through my testing with the 8700 K
and the 2,700 X there's a bunch of crap
wrong with that initial report not just
with the way they tested it but with
their results obviously the two go
hand-in-hand so why not run internal
investigations Intel keep everything
nipped and tucked tech companies do this
all the time you do it all the time by
the way it's called RT t R&amp;amp;D research
and development and testing the testing
phase is important we all know not to
trust the benchmarks released by the
same companies releasing the referencing
products right that was a case with
Nvidia the same way with AMD and Intel
but maybe Intel took this to heart and
said well maybe we'll just pay another
company to do it and it won't look like
they're our benchmarks and there we go I
mean maybe they chose a company that
didn't even know how to benchmark gaming
CPUs graphics cards I mean games in
general didn't look like they really
knew what they were doing I mean they
were pretty consistent it looked like
they've done plenty of tests before but
when it comes to testing games on a
computer it wasn't as straightforward as
I thought it would be and it was not as
accurately done as I thought it would be
fact there were several things again
completely wrong with it so I'm just
questioning the whole thing it doesn't
really make sense to me and I think it
was a really shady move on until sparked
not necessarily PT because again they've
gone back and they fix things remember
they were paid by Intel to begin with so
if this was a payoff for them to ski
results
PT's gone back and broken that phase of
the contract if that again is the case I
don't really think it is I think Intel
just took advantage of the situation
that's that's what I'm willing to say at
this point based on what I've seen the
other reports from my colleagues out
there it looks as though Intel
purposefully chose this company kind of
just gave them a rough sketch of what
they wanted and then hoped that they
would do something dumb like this nope
that they would enable game mode use 64
gigs of ram and down clock ram on a and
b platforms but keep it overclocked on
Intel platforms I mean some of it is
again a little too obvious but I'm not
going to crucify PT because they have
gone back and they have fixed things and
that's why I kind of wanted to wait
before I released my own video regarding
this topic because I wanted to see if PT
would go back and correct the issues we
all make mistakes
these are pretty big mistakes but they
corrected them nonetheless Intel however
is standing by the initial report and I
think that is just a bit ridiculous let
me know what you think in the comments
