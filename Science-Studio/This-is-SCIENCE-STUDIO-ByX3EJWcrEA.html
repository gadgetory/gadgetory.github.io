haven't already noticed this channel's
name has been changed back to science to
do so now whenever in the video I will
say this is science to do thanks for
learning with this that just you guys
are right it rolls up the tongue so much
better than Salazar studio does and I
really want to pay homage to the people
that started this channel in the first
place I started this channel with the
name science studio and we grew so much
during the first I don't know the first
seven or eight months it just blew my
mind how interested you guys were in the
stuff that we were talking about when we
were called science to do granted I've
been very busy with school the good
thing is I'm about to be out of school
permanently I'm graduating in a week
literally and now I can just devote all
of my time to the content that you see
here on this channel now I want to be
honest with all of you I didn't write a
script or plan anything out I just want
to talk from the heart as cliche as that
sounds I changed the name to Salazar
studio a while back because I expected
at some point that I would branch away
from just doing tech and I would be
doing other things maybe travel vlogs or
you know social experiments something I
don't know something different but that
I could always come back to tech
whenever we really wanted to because
that was what most of you originally
subscribed for but the more I try to
branch out the more I realized I
honestly love doing what we've already
been doing for the past year and a half
or so you see it's easy to say that all
of you just subscribe to the tech right
that's that's simple that's just a
general category it's an umbrella but a
true CEO a true leader of a company
knows exactly why people subscribe
exactly why people keep coming back to
that particular company or product over
and over again and I know exactly why a
lot of you originally subscribe to the
channel now I'm going to give you all of
that just like we used to back in the
good old days so about a year ago you
know a year ago we only had 10,000 subs
can you believe that a year ago today if
you're following me on social media you
would have already known that so we're
going to bring back a lot of the science
studio goodness what I'm doing like
acting like I'm pulling on a rope we're
going to also talk about CPU
architectures we're going to break down
graphics cards we're going to look at
frame rate variances based on different
in-game settings what each of those
means by the way we've been kind of
hinting at that in previous videos but a
lot of the stuff that made science
studio great is what I'm going to bring
back
this channel because I know that's what
a lot if you subscribe for and I know a
lot of you do miss it remember all the
popups a snap pop-ups all over the
screen have little pop sounds we do all
these animations which we're all at
Adobe Premiere by the way I don't know
how to use After Effects I have no
choice they're all that stuff I want to
bring back I want to make this the same
channel that we were a little under a
year ago maybe even revisit some of the
topics that we covered last year so
that's why the name has changed if
you're new when you subscribe when we
were selves our studio this is just us
changing it back to the good old days it
doesn't mean that your content will
necessarily change but you will see some
differences in the way that we analyze
products the way that things are broken
down and the explanations I expect will
be a bit more in-depth so I'll do my
best to speak slowly I know that's an
issue of mine I need to work on that
speak slowly and also make sure that
it's simplified as much as possible
without compromising on the important
information if you have any questions
concerns leave those in the comments I
look forward to kicking off the first
video tomorrow with a breakdown of p and
y's gtx 1080p I this is science studio
thanks for learning with this
