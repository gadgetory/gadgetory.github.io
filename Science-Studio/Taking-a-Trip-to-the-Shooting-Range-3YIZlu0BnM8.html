okay so we're out at the shooting range
this because and this is the south so
you're gonna see a lot of guns here and
this you're gonna be something to change
up the vibe channel we've been aiming
downhill if you uh assault rifle shots
and we're at the handgun station here
you can okay and then okay this is a
Ruger security six is called and this is
a 38 caliber it's also 350 okay so these
little popgun this is a standard firearm
military up to about the 60s
ready to go this is the night 1888
replica you have to load them one at a
time this Cowboys used to using the Wild
West this was the gun you have to cock
it every time
well it's one of those big shells for
that's a 45 colt 40 what they're called
black powder slow burning black but it's
logical
so you look at the difference this is a
30-i milk same as the 38 but notice
magnum round that has that much more
more power so these just have Springs in
them
that's a how the bullets are loaded yep
one fire ejecting the spring pushes the
next one up now these guns do not have
to say hold the trigger they will shoot
these have safeties on this is just like
a wild whisker beautiful sweet so that's
our closed target maybe shooting from
right there welcome to the south ladies
and gentlemen okay let me shoot the 357
Magnum just for y'all sweet
all the guns are shot this one in this
smooth Brandon feels good
you shot oh that's I say dead center
with that you see it yeah oh yeah pull
it back yeah I think that was the one
used to spy I know that magaman that's
my gonna Troy shoot that small when you
had hey Jacob where's that concealed
little small one that one right thing
yeah we'll try that one out
oh right now okay game face on and then
that's part about shooting guns it's
cleaning them afterwards was that for
the ar-15 where's the other uh grease
has a gun no yeah red dot sight it's
probably the most intricate piece of
this guy no joke
this was my favorite gun by far smooth
like butter shooting this bad boy while
we settle this dispute I'm going in the
video this is sell is our studio thanks
for shooting with us and reassembling
with us we'll be doing this for a while</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
