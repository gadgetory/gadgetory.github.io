what is arrived in studio and the plans
that I have for the custom Waterloo PC
that I've been hinting at a few videos
and also talking extensively about on
Twitter I'm just super giddy about it
because it will be my first custom loop
ever and I'll pretty much be building
the whole thing myself why I have I have
a few mentors who I will mention
periodically in the official build log
videos but I without them there's no way
I could do this I probably won't even
know what to buy in terms of parts there
are so many things to go through the
different fittings just the the tube
size decision things like that you would
think we're just having you know pretty
self-explanatory and simple to do
there's a lot of thought that goes into
just one custom loop build and there are
people on YouTube who do it who do these
like you know like nothing like normal
PC builds so I am definitely a newb I
don't make any secret of that I'm sure
I'll do a few things wrong and you guys
will yell at me extensively in the
comments for that but that's okay this
is a learning experience for me and if
you guys haven't done this either then
you can kind of learn and and I guess
experience it as we go so the first
things I want to talk about are the two
gtx 1080s i have here i purchased these
out of my own pocket namely because i
don't have any contacts with EVGA at
this point and also because the previous
plan was to use the 210 70s in
heisenberg and these PCBs are pretty
much the same there are a few
differences on board especially between
this and something like the for the win
edition but the water blocks are
compatible universally with all these AC
X cards and so that's good but it did
mean that I had to stick with EVGA which
I'll have a problem with they're great
cards they're very quiet and
temperatures are great so I have no
problem doing that but I did have to
shell out $1200 so that's what you're
looking at here two boxes that over 600
bucks each granted you're gonna get some
of the best performance possible I think
the only thing you could do better maybe
he's a upgrade to Titans but at that
point you're just you're just spending
money just to spend money would you have
a look at you know this is the first gtx
1080i have ever owned and just realized
that and on i own two of them but I've
only ever owned ten 70s because a single
1070 is more than enough for 1080p ultra
wide gaming which is this is my monitor
of choice right here very
budget-friendly ultrawide monitor 20
you can check out the review right here
if you're interested and then I had the
pixie of 1440p hundred and forty-four
Hertz monitor and the second 10:17 that
maxed that one out I didn't want to just
sell the ten seventy by single 1080 and
I think two cards looks way better two
cards look way better in there in a
single single 1080 wood so we have two
of these again for the custom Waterloo
build keep in mind the water blocks will
require the removal of the entire a CX
3.0 cooler system as well as the
backplate so alpha cool is our water
cooling sponsor for this entire thing
and you'll see all those parts hopefully
by the end of this week that's what I
want that's what I want to get started
it's gonna take a while to do all of
this and being that it's my first time I
expect I'll be screwing up quite often
now if you're wondering where all of
these components are going so I'm going
to take the core of Heisenberg and then
these two gtx 1080s
and i'm gonna throw these in to spin
around this way that right there that
says oh 11 and that's because it's the
PCO 11 from Leanne Lee this is a case of
cases now you've probably heard of the
PCO 9 that's kind of like this thing's
older brother this is a bit more refined
it's slightly different on the inside as
you'll see here shortly now but it still
leaves plenty of room for a custom loop
as you can see I mean the motherboard is
gonna take up probably half of the space
inside and everything else is is and I
just left bare you want to throw some
huge radiators in here you are more than
capable of doing that in a case this
size and additionally if you can already
tell tempered glass surround the front
end left side which is also super cool
Leoni is kind of like the tempered glass
champion at this point so you have
plenty of room inside the PCO 11 just
for you know kind of a point of
reference here that's at 1 G 2 X 1080
the second one will be about here and it
will stop plenty space down below for a
360 mo radiator I think I just went for
this 60 millimeter thick radiator I want
to say maybe 40 mil I don't I don't
or what I got and then there will be
three fans exhausting down and their
spaces below the case for that hot air
to escape and I'll also have another 360
ml up top same configuration just
exhausting upward and then the reservoir
will fit here along with the pump
underneath I actually drew this out so
this is kind of cheesy yeah I don't see
many people doing this I'm just doing
this because it's my first time and I'm
very nervous about by the way out now
this is probably you know kind of having
you one edge right here what I did here
so this isn't in parallel and I bet that
Ben's gonna really suck so we'll see and
play some maybe 90 degree fittings to
work that out
worst case you know we can always change
that up and I ordered plenty of tubing
by the place a week we can we can afford
to screw up more than once and still be
comfortable so the plan is from the
reservoir down to the radiator here on
this side and then the opposite side of
that coming up to the first graphics
card and then to the second graphics
card from there to the CPU and then from
the CPU to the top radiator radiator
from there all the way back down to the
reservoir now a few of you were voicing
your concerns about the I guess the
configuration the layout how I have it
set up here to where the first graphics
card will supposedly receive the coolest
air and then it's the second card it's
or they're not coolest and but the
coolest water like would you know what I
mean
and then the second card then by the
time it all gets to the CPU the liquids
gonna be pretty hot right because these
two graphics cards are gonna be fairly
overclocked and yeah just putting out a
lot of heat well the thing is this has
been tested extensively not by me but by
others who I trust and rely on 100% the
the order here isn't gonna make a huge
difference and it's not like I have to
have you know the loop running to the
first card and then have you know having
a radiator right after that because that
water is already gonna be pretty hot
that's not really how it works it's just
like a picture like one big system so
the water as a whole as long as you have
enough radiator support will remain
relatively cool even with all of these
overclock which they will be I'm gonna
try to get around four point maybe 4.8
4.9 gigahertz with the 5820k I'm already
getting four point seven in Heisenberg
and that's what they crackin X 62
so I think I can get a bit more with the
custom loop and then these cards here
I'll shoot for ya I'd say at least over
20 maybe 20 100 megahertz I have no idea
it's just gonna depend on the cards and
how far I'm willing to push these
voltage wise but yeah that's that's a
layout of course this is subject to
change and I'm sure that will change
once I do start bending these tubes and
realizing how hard it actually is but I
think the case is beautiful I'm very
thankful freely and Lee for sending us
over and I think that the 1080s
will be a nice upgrade sorry I wasn't
pointing the camera in the right
direction that needs to be nice to
upgrade and I'm very comfortable with
the 5820k being that it only has 28 PCIe
lanes it's gonna be a bit of a concern
that means that both of these cards are
gonna be running it at times eight
instead of full 16 lanes they'll be
running it with eight lanes which I
haven't done testing on personally but I
do believe that will slightly bottom
like the 10 80s the 1080 sendi is a bit
more bandwidth than the typical card
that would kind of make sense right the
10 70s are fine that way but the 1080 is
I think it'll be pushing it so maybe
maybe an upgrade to a 68 50k at some
point I'm not sure but that will be
discussed later on once I do run my
tests but that's it I do hope that you
are wonderful willing to leave comments
suggestions tips tricks anything that
you may have personally experienced or
seen on other YouTube channels that you
trust that you think will help me with
us with this building process it's gonna
be it's gonna be tough and I don't
expect it'll work out completely on the
first try if it does yeah but I'm me you
know and I can't plug power supply
cables into their correct power supplies
so there's that by the way here shortly
I'll be uploading a review of a pair of
wireless Bluetooth in your headphones I
received from a company called syllabus
I think that's a name the company if
that's not they have a company I'm it's
not really stupid but yeah I'll give you
like a first impressions raw unboxing if
you will I'll put them on my ears not
tell you how could I think they sound
especially for the price and you can
kind of we'll go from there I guess this
is Salazar's studio thanks for listening
thanks for putting up with me thanks for
learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
