biggest issue on our channel in
particular I've tried lavalier
microphones shock mounted microphones
atop DSLR cameras of which you're
listening to right now pretty much
everything except for something like
this the blue Yeti ultimate professional
USB condenser microphone okay so this
thing sounds pretty sweet and pretty
much any mode that you set it in let me
go and give you a tour while using the
microphone itself in stereo mode as a
voiceover to start off the Yeti boasts
fantastic build quality the included
stand is rigid padded and dynamic enough
to allow the microphone itself to rotate
over 270 degrees it can be removed from
the stand altogether by simply
unscrewing the pins on either side of
the stand itself the front of the
microphone features the blue brand logo
a mute button which when pushed will
mute the microphone ambient flashing and
a volume knob for use with a headphone
set the bottom of the device contains
the USB port for use with the included
USB cable support for a large microphone
stand this one's currently fitted with
the optional smaller microphone stand
adapter and finally the headphone jack
to be used in conjunction with the
volume knob up front on the opposite
side of the Eddy are two more knobs one
for functionality and one for gain the
gain is a very simple tool turning it up
will generally increase microphone
sensitivity too much sensitivity however
can lead to unwanted background noise
and Static the bottom knob allows for
switching between the yetis four
built-in sound modes stereo
omnidirectional cardioid and
bi-directional blue recommends the
stereo preset which i'm using currently
for instrumentals ensembles and other
music related activities cardioid is
preferable for radio talk show host
voice overs and solo artists
omnidirectional is ideal for conference
calls and large audiences when people
you know surround the microphone and
lastly bi-directional mode is solely for
the purpose of interviews duets and tag
team projects here's a quick sample of
each preset this is a test of the blue
Yeti microphone in stereo mode this is a
test of the blue Yeti microphone an
omnidirectional mode this is a test of
the blue Yeti microphone in cardioid
mode
this is a test of the blue Yeti
microphone in bi-directional mode at
fifty percent gain so that's it everyone
for this video I love this blue Yeti
microphone i think was a great
investment for the studio and at only
ninety nine dollars for this kind of
sound you really can't beat that if you
think that you can't beat it you have a
product that's similar in price point
and quality picture to listed in the
comments below attached some links you
know let people know about the other
options that they have out there but in
my personal opinion this blue Yeti is
it's fabulous for what i paid for it and
stay tuned because we will be taking
advantage of this microphone in all of
my future videos it will be featured and
used a lot i expect so if you like the
video be sure to give it a thumbs up if
you didn't like it for whatever reason
give it a thumbs down and let me know
also in the comments why you didn't like
it stay tuned for other videos like this
other tech videos and other computer
science ii videos i have the vlogs for
the lenovo ideapad 100 s coming up very
soon this is science to do thanks for
learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
