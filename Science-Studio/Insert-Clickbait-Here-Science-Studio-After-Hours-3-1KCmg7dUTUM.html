December 10 2017 is approximately 9 o 9
p.m. and we ready to talk some tech and
talk some other stuff relevant to most
of you out there although I will admit
we do not have a plan we do not have a
plan at all we have no script or
anything we don't even have like
websites for articles or anything so
we'll take it away oh man
but there's people we have no plan we
have absolutely nothing like burnin to
talk about I guess we can discuss the
Titan okay is it the Titan V or the
Titan 5 what do you call it like it's
the Titan V coz it's like called the
iPhone to iPhone 10 or the iPhone X by
the way I needed that like for the
review video so we have to redo that at
some point but I need to I need to get
this so I can do the comparison treat
here yeah we'll bought an iPhone 10 so
you guys can just look at yeah
everyone's saying it's not five it's uh
it's the Titan V stands for Volta that's
right
of course therefore 60 X or NZXT s340
leave Steve and I have a video
discussing I think all three I recommend
in GXT s3 for you yeah clean what I
would have said - I prefer the in 60
case so what's up Jim Eames sabja meems
how you doing my professor calls his
phone the iPhone 10 it hurts me is it
the iPhone 10 what it's the iPhone -
it's not the iPhone X come on like you
really think Apple would go with X they
always have the they had the One X I had
the Moto X I have a bunch of phones with
X n I mean Apple wants to be different
they're like you know what Rx is gonna
actually stand for the number for once
this is a Roman numeral play not of a
letter play it's actually called the
iPhone 10 it's not X yes that's what
we're saying
Oh what up what's up Josh Kemp how you
doing
iPhone 10 sucks suck it will what's up
guys what's going on bland bland
Germania Apple has said it's the ex well
I don't trust Apple I think we're gonna
go with 10 are you demonetised yet will
you want checking for to monetize oh
yeah
it's actually very likely that we are I
love to love to see I hope you guys
enjoyed our clickbait livestream title I
don't know what it is okay
and I'm going to call them out cuz like
I'm sure he'll just be upfront with is
but Linus always has some like clickbait
TAF title for their live streams for the
land show so I figured we would just
follow suit here and and just be upfront
about it you know with our click Beatty
title and such that's the point baby
otherwise you wouldn't watch it I mean
that's got a true like unless you have
some serious substance I mean like the
goal I mean I guess all of these tech
channels kind of do the same thing where
they run through a bunch of a bunch of
relevant tech for the week and kind of
like discuss their own feelings and
whatnot
yeah the v30 yeah we got a serious
problem here he says hello I have a
problem with my PC when I rage and punch
my desk while I'm gaming my PC restart
sometimes it started doing that a month
ago looks likely because that it's very
strange you might not have anything to
do with your PC at all might be a
connection to your wall you have to
check I know I have a surge protector
like one of those splitters sweetie call
the ones with the multiple outlets on
them extension ports I have one of those
it's kind of janky it just like wobbles
and it disconnects and clicks back on so
you might want to be checking there
that's increased rate on YouTube right
now Bitcoin price predictions if your if
your computer's restarting when you
punch your desk while you're while
you're playing games I think you should
try to like get up get a bat maybe and
hit it with a bat next time see if that
helps it probably end up with better
results there yeah I just realized that
the camera that like my camera angle is
pretty trash because they can see the
entire desk that's not what I wanted I
wanted them to be able to see like maybe
this window here like but they're able
to see everything
I'll have to fix that next time what are
you learning I'm not hiding anything but
like they're seeing like floor like
they're seeing a bunch of junk on the
floor you know like the closets aren't
clean well I don't know have you
reviewed the AMD phenom ii x4 965 no I
have not
guys trust me Bitcoin will be worth 30k
in two weeks
you guys are ex r r5 1600 X plus Vegas
64 ultra wide gaming like a boss thought
sunrise in 2000 series rumors I don't
deal with rumors anymore I used to deal
with that crap it ain't even worth it
anymore
sorry Brian I just it's like an endless
rabbit hole you know and when you're
wrong people are oh you were wrong
hahaha oh yeah I just freakin like took
a shot in the dark here based on past
trends it's really all you can do and I
just yeah yes y'all guys gotta see the
film room that's still pretty trashy
yeah
dude I've never been wrong yeah wills
never been wrong yeah I've never made a
prediction so can never view that's true
it's true I hear ya that's what's up
Brian I need to know if you will review
the dg7 he said I want to get it to
replace us before you leave - before you
leave wouldn't fit my full loop so I'm
using an AI oh right now well yeah I
mean but you should I don't know unless
you I assumed you wanted to upgrade to a
custom look after you bought the S
before you leave but you don't go into a
build with an S 340 elite and expect to
build a custom loop in it like easy as
cake you know like you got to have a
much bigger chassis I think to work with
that cable management bar blocks a lot
you don't have a lot of space in front
because the basement goes all the way up
to the very front of the case and
there's really no room for a pump or
anything
Nick's commenting on the live stream
Nick I think I think you should come
jump on the live stream new Nick Cowen
McGowan will is never wrong in his life
like a lot confirmed
yeah do what seriously we have no clue
what's going on with the like pod thing
like we'd started the stream I jumped on
like 10 minutes after we made the event
and then we're like a hundred likes I
don't know what's going on
I don't like how do you how do you have
like we had like 25 people watching and
it first started now there's like
there's only 125 and it doesn't make any
sense yeah like I'm clearly I'm not
smart enough to even know how to
manipulate that crap so I have no clue
what's going on we'll was just busy
setting up the livestream like he wasn't
doing anything in the background we send
up it like what before usually Greg
should I pair our 560 hundred with the
1080 Strix or the 1066 gig I can't I
mean I can't answer that question for
you obviously the 1080 is gonna be a lot
better just depends how much money you
want to spend I can't I can't answer
that that question because it's not my
money it's yours
spam rip angry grandpa rip angry grandpa
what am I missing something there can't
stay gotta work tomorrow English I'm
confused thanks Martin appreciate your
stopping by if you're still here I
appreciate it
just got RGB fans my life is not
complete what why would it not be
complete
when I hit the like button I added 100
likes to the stream hax confirmed see ya
it's just the magic click of will I need
you to show up on every single one of my
videos
whatever happened to McLovin McLovin is
everyone always asked this but McLovin
works like he has a job he doesn't do
this full-time like I do
so he's busy all the time he works at a
hospital so they're always killing them
for hours of all the AI OS you've tested
have any of them died so far two of mine
died so far for the year I've had this
PC I haven't had a single a I know I
have had one I had one from Corsair
actually I'm not even joking I had a
Corsair cool or die granted it was a
refurbished one but I bought it off a
new egg for like 60 bucks think of an H
90 I think was Corsair age 90 and it
died I think more or less just because
it was open box or refurbished I don't
remember which one but that was the omen
ever had died I have a feeling though
like about half of the kids I get sin
I'm sure they open the boxes beforehand
and make sure that they actually work
you know because they don't want me
opening a box and saying oh this doesn't
work and telling all of you so I'm
pretty sure they check but I've bought
probably half of them or they've sent
two or three for giveaways and stuff
doesn't always work too so it just
depends I'm curious what - what - a iOS
did you have the died I'm actually
curious no yes
Terry a column pulled it a charity
stream they're like 10 grand for what
was it what was the charity that they
were doing it for children's hospitals
is that what it's called they did some
they were raising it for some charity
any words on how to make money for
computer parts start cheap and sell your
PC for more than you paid for it that's
how I did it
these Sunday nights live streams are a
cruel reminder that tomorrow is Monday
hey but that's why we're here right
don't think about think about tomorrow I
know for some of those who were in
college today was likely their last day
which is pretty cool
so if we're not today but you know like
last week so that's awesome
already Monday here I've been getting
shafted by the early Monday morning
stream I appreciate that though for
stopping by it's pretty cool well what
do you don't over there oh I'm looking
at Facebook I don't have the core
seconder Perot for my HD fans okay cool
Children's Hospital for LA that's cool
yeah I I figured that's actually what it
was called I was trying to remember
because it wasn't like one of the ones
that like st. Jude's or anything like
that I'm in college and have two more
weeks you have two more weeks where do
you go to college two more weeks is
Christmas cheese hey Greg I can't seem
to get my Ripjaws 3216 gig kid to stay
overclocked
I am running a be 350 gaming Pro that's
probably your issue it's a be 350 game
be 350 boards are not gonna very few of
them are gonna let you get that high
with with memory even running XMP
profile that's just the nature of cheap
motherboards if you want to get that
high a memory clock then you're gonna
have to go with the X 370 could be I
could have something to do with your
BIOS settings in general but make sure
that your BIOS settings are sticking you
cpu-z
and you should be able to confirm with
everything sticking or not exam tomorrow
at 8:00 a.m. decided to watch this
Josh camp okay I'm gonna be I'm gonna be
honest with you here you should close
the livestream and start studying okay
because you can always come back to this
but school school can't wait you got it
you got a study man at this Sunday
school comes first
yeah drop OH when it comes first it
don't pull a who
how many of the billionaires out there
will have dropped out of high school
probably high school not a whole lot all
the ones that matter yeah all the ones
that matter in that weird though I don't
know it's just a strange I mean you know
either they go to school get taught how
to work in a system or create your own
hire people to do it for you yeah yeah
no regrets I have an i7 7700 and try to
try to stream on three platforms like
YouTube Twitter and Facebook and it just
does not like I get hell of framedrops
and OBS any suggestions please help what
else would you do it are you streaming
games
I assume you're streaming games make
sure your network speed is bottlenecking
that's kind of a like obvious answer but
double check on that because you're
streaming to three different platforms
that can be pretty intense truck or bomb
what's going on appreciate that
Dulles Dulles donation thank you very
much
Bobby yeah I would check check CPU
utilization and then check check your
network speed just make sure like if you
have around 100 megabits per second
download maybe 50 megabits per second
upload you should be okay but anything
lower than that you you be cutting it
close
what laptop to buy well for what price
make price range the Mac what price
range stream into a stream server and
let that handle the substrate yeah we've
done that before what do we use will for
the streams they're ready we use well
we've used a few different ones
restreamed iOS the one that comes to
mind but there's the one we use recently
I forgot what it's called restream IO is
pretty good obviously any time you you
know you send it to a transcoding server
linear you're gonna add latency which is
hard when you're doing like live chat
yes game says my CPU is 49 percent hmm
yeah then that's gonna be a no BS
setting then if your CPU is not being
over utilized and I expect that you
probably have something going on in OBS
that would take at least a few minutes
to diagnose we'd have to look at it hey
guys what's going on
Jed class
class SIA classy I just butchered that I
apologize
Jax computers keep up the good work when
you think of the 6800 K today appreciate
the donation my man I am gonna have to
say 1600 K I wouldn't pay more than
about he I'm struggling to even say 300
but I would I wouldn't pay any more than
300 bucks for it still a really good
ship I have the 5820k still which is
basically the younger counterpart but
they're they're still good ships for
what they are it's going over there will
I just pull up the the website so this
is a website that's nice to do on it why
do we have that cheesy video background
yeah it's the only thing I can find is
it like laggy mark for you it's like a
hardcore it's like the rain by frame
here dude that's awesome
anyway I think this videos to YouTube
video it ii unlisted one it's embedded
so it's 4k so it's trying to like play
4k i can hear me like freaking out
anyway oh it's so bad it's just like let
me click off of it like if I click on
the merch page oh yeah by the way this
is the merch page diverge look at
marlott yeah like look it's smooth
smoother it's MCEs trash yeah we're
using Squarespace
and for no real reason I mean it was
just kind of easy and one before
something up really quickly yeah so Pro
website builder that's all
yeah I kind of heard me when I saw
Greg's first web site made out Wix and
now it's like I don't know bro don't
hate on my website my creation man but
back wall rekt anyway I'm gonna totally
plug this because why not
we basically who was it I forgot the
guy's name but we tweeted out a while
ago asking for people to send in merch
designs and that's what you guys came up
with so yeah so it's like a little
scroll down box so thanks for then you
can insert learning building playing
ranging what's the other one it's uh I
don't know it's really it's really
questioning
yeah laughing with us yeah so basically
strut set in the past he just kind of
compiled them all and made it like a
drop-down menu which is I think it's
pretty clever
yeah the shirt is uh gonna come in the
mail it'll come a lot less pixelated
than this yeah dude why is your screen
take so pixelated so much are you just
sitting in a great yeah I'm just doing
me I like I think I might a shrink the
picture too much but anyway birthday
Roman I see that happy birthday and then
if you want a will shirt which I don't
know why you'd want a will shirt but if
you want to share it with my name on it
for no apparent reason there is because
he does will thanks you guys know if you
send me a picture I'll like send you a
Starbucks gift card or something
that's my way like you know I just know
someone that's all yes we have the we
have the bird store it's alive you can
buy one right now if you want
I think there's what 20 bucks for around
20 dollars or so and it's like a flat
rate shipping thing basically we're
grouping them we're grouping them all
well am I even on yep oh sorry I had my
face on there they like my face sir oh
so I have to say I have I didn't do
anything you built the website lisa says
she wants a t-shirt you can pay for it
like everybody else she wants the
wilshire but she doesn't want to sign
each reader she's a traitor
one more is there any way to get more
out of my 7700 I know it automatically
goes 4.2 anyway I could squeeze a little
more you could tinker with your base
clock a little bit I don't know if your
mother was gonna let you but I know for
a skylake you could overclock with the
base clock method you had pretty good
breathing room there with Kb it's not
possible as far as I'm concerned but you
might like an extra three megahertz or
something else yeah I mean if you want
to get five you here it's easy on it you
just got to get a wheeeeel shirt and lay
it on top of your computer this is wills
will sure plug just so yeah all I want
is one person to buy one like if one
person does it all like a latch like
it's all like shared on the screen oh I
do a dress obviously but Greg what HDD
imaging solution D is I don't use what
it was he talking about I even use
anything like that imaging solution
what hdz imaging solution used along I
mean to be honest I just used the
terminal and OS 10 that sounds really
trashy but like I mean just DD Breaux DD
on the terminal fellow 5820k user here
have you considered hackintosh in your
system I think it'd be pretty cool video
I did - yeah I mean I wouldn't use it
though like it would just be for you
guys I would not take advantage of that
at all
so I think it would just take so much
time and then at the end of the day like
because YouTube is shafting us in terms
of like view counts in the algo playing
its role I don't even think we would add
like we would get enough views to even
justify all the work I would put into it
so I'd have to get like a petition you
guys have to sign a petition on Twitter
or something start a hashtag and then
maybe I'll build a hackintosh but right
now it's just that's just not feasible
based on how many views I think we'll
get on that video sub kids what's your
favorite case I don't care about price I
have a video literally answering that
but I appreciate the five dollar
donation so that video is titled this is
my favorite PC case and in that video I
disclosed that my favorite PC case is
the fractal defined C because when some
kid said he doesn't care about price you
should get a will case also you want for
tinkering oh yeah that's true
10k oh it's pretty good it's a shacking
tosh.o check
hashtag OSS I see it hashtag SS
hackintosh but you put two O's in it man
like what the Greg how are you gonna be
if I open up Squarespace right now when
people ordered my shirt but not yours
I'm gonna say I wouldn't even be that
triggers gonna be pretty miraculous at
this point because we're like plugging
it off the cuff on a live stream cipher
lock says p400s yeah that's also a great
case I think that one's second on my
list and that's followed very closely
behind by the NZXT s340 elite okay so
I'm curious what do you suggest I do to
get used to being in front of a camera
okay so this this is
an interesting question but it really
comes down to you have to focus on
something else you have to pretend he
almost have to pretend that you're not
speaking to an audience like when I said
when I do it when I film here like I
don't picture myself speaking to
thousands of people that are eventually
gonna view it I'm picturing myself
speaking to one person because only one
person at a time like the whole family
is not gonna sit in front of a TV screen
and watch a science to do a video like I
just know it's not gonna happen they're
gonna it's gonna be a one-on-one thing
whether someone's gonna want to know
something or they're gonna want to see
something being built and it's gonna be
like that personal experience so I
treated almost like I'm talking to a
friend like I'm trying to explain to a
friend how something works and it just
makes it feel a bit more personal I
think that's how I've tackled it in the
past because I'm not the best public
speaker but in front of a camera I treat
it totally different yeah we're you just
trying to do a video and like me and it
doesn't work
we're not gonna link that because we
leave that last time and we lost half of
our livestream they all clicked yeah
ambu climate though they got some views
on that video that night well an s340
elite with an X 60 to crack and choke my
EVGA 1080 TI for the win 3 no I don't
think so
you might have to ramp your curve up
just a bit but the resistance that and
that a radiator induces I would have I
would have to see I'm not sure how
exactly the physics work there but I
don't think that you're if anything
you're gonna have a louder system
because the wind is gonna be pushing
through all those fins but your airflow
overall isn't gonna be that blower and
if you're worried about temperatures I
mean that you can put your hand behind a
radiator and just kind of feel how hot
the air is it's not that bad any air to
your graphics card is better than no air
unless it's like 300 degrees and then
you get a problem yeah it's kind of
crazy uh with the whatsit I guess so we
have 154 views our viewers right now and
when we look at like YouTube like I
literally put the titles insert click
play here which really wasn't clickbait
because I've seen those videos
everywhere but for example last week's
video was YouTube is killing itself
first off we got demonetised instantly
and then but we had like 550 viewers so
it's really crazy
like that the clickbait game is real
like it's it's it's real rusty says
there are four deer and manufacturers
how do you have such a short supply so
it's all about the new stuff right all
about ten nanometer that's that shift
that we're starting to see where we're
at in the middle of it they're shifting
to ten enemy Girardi's taking up a lot
of their time a lot of their
infrastructure is focused on R&amp;amp;D for ten
nanometers so right now they're not
producing much of the 14 nanometer crap
that we're used to having in ddr4 and
the like so we have basically a shortage
in supply a short of a shortage of
supply because of our D which is a bit
ironic but I expect those prices will
drop again once the ten nanometer
fabrication is pushed hello everyone
like pay title alright it's so click
Beatty I can't pull up let me see I'm
gonna see if I can pull up this guy
anyway this guy ordered a t-shirt his
name's Michael but he ordered Greg's
t-shirt not mine
oh good game yeah he was in the
Netherlands though I don't wanna put
your address on the screen but thanks
Michael hey we appreciate that Michael I
hope yeah what you should do actually
it's really cool so you get the shirt
take a picture like a selfie with you
and the shirt and then we'll retreated
on Twitter and we'll start posting some
on Instagram and stuff we'll do it you
know you multiple like upload multiple
pictures on Instagram at the same time
well upload a bunch of fans wearing the
t-shirts and we'll post them all to
Instagram if you want to be on the
channel yeah of course but it'll be cool
we also have new patreon silver silver
Anna Cardenas oh gosh I don't know but
oh yeah yeah oh he was a patreon member
before oh he he just pledged 25 more
bucks so whoa appreciate that
that is awesome that's more than we
could ever ask for but we appreciate
that generosity and support I'd buy a
t-shirt if I could get it signed well
what you could do is buy it and then
ship it to our and then I can sign it
for you and then send it back to you if
you if you want to buy one if you want
it signed then we can figure that out
yeah we'll figure it out I mean if you
buy a black t-shirt though keep in mind
on off to use like a silver sharpie cuz
like black ain't gonna work on that
hello from China while I can hello
oh gosh that's good I actually did a
report recently on Chinese censorship
for my from one of my master's classes
and I thought was really interesting
they did a poll and they found now of
course I don't know what like you know
how reliable this poll was or who was
specifically polled but they ran the
survey and apparently up this I think it
was something like 70% of the Chinese
citizens a favor
censorship government censorship to some
degree online which i think is very
interesting because like from you know
in the Western culture and Europe in the
US it's like you know don't censor
anything right unless it's illegal so
it's it's kind of strange how the
culture gap they're like you just have
two completely different viewpoints on
the same issue but I like reading about
that stuff because I like I like trying
to understand other people's points of
view like why do you feel that way you
know no regrets bro we got you right
here 3x oh it's right there dick Willie
right there what's up sup kids that was
really that was a weird thing
appreciate that five dollars you owe is
it uh is that an asus strix gtx 1080 or
is that an RX or is that it i can't tell
is that a Vegas 64 or is that an Nvidia
card I can't tell but it looks like
looks like he got yourself an asus strix
card they're pretty sweet Andrew Jones
says stick Tootsie 2 C's Jacob says will
has a Mac come on bro
yeah well unfortunately I don't know
anybody that sort of build pcs WTF will
sticks to do there we go
good looks let me check them out real
quick common sense said this like a
couple times let me see if I can find it
what streaming software we're using this
is just it's just Google Hangouts but
it's Google Hangouts on air so yeah
Google hangout fire I built into YouTube
but yeah we're actually switching to OBS
and stuff but this allows us to do the
stream with Greg at his house and me at
my house even though are a few miles
away it's just it's the ultimate
definition of laziness it really is yeah
cuz I live actually about 30 minutes
from well does what's up Jimmy
question of yours what are your
expectations Verizon - so here's what I
really expect in a let's just call it a
rise and refresh I don't know exactly
what we're gonna see in a risin - lineup
but what I will say that I'm hoping that
we get in the next line up of CPU
releases from AMD excluding the AP use
that are coming soon is higher overclock
ability I think that's the one thing
right now hindering Rison I think the
fact that we can only hit maybe four
four point one gigahertz is it's just
not enough to keep up with intel on the
gaming sphere it's still great CPUs for
gaming it's still great multitasking CPU
so the better value chip is on the red
team but from just like an objective raw
compute performance standpoint Intel's
favored because they can overclock to
55.2 kicker it's even higher sometimes
so I'm hoping that rise into at least
gives us a bit more overclocking
Headroom and then we'll really be
talking about a serious like one to one
competition one where's McLovin people
could be asking about mclubbe he's
working that's like the answer all the
time he's working come over he goes 23
right yeah 23 yeah between almost 22
yeah when do you turn 20 oh no you turn
23 like later on don't ya yeah and you
yeah you're like yeah you were one of
the youngest ones in our grade yeah nice
one p.m. why are there any monitors
featuring IPS panels with lower than 4
millisecond response time not too sure
about that I did a video I made a video
talking about the differences technology
between like TN and IPS I'm sure there
are IPS panels out there that are like
one millisecond but the reason why TN is
better for that the reason why TN panels
have better better refresh rates is a
response times is because of the way
that those crystals in the pixel are
laid out so a TN panel has the liquid
crystals in there that's why it's called
an LCD panel those liquid crystals are
kind of twisted that's why they call it
TN twisted nematic and when you want
light to go through then the thing will
twist up or it'll untwist depends on how
its
calibrated but let's say a nun twist to
let more light through right so that
turns on the pixel so if it untwist with
certain degree right it's quicker for it
to just twist like that than it is for
in an IPS panel with inner plane
switching that whole like crystal
lattice has to shift 90 degrees or it's
got to go you know forty five to forty
five or however it's setup so it's
basically that the distance that the the
liquid crystal has to travel when it
lets more light through and it also
requires different varying amounts of
voltage the electrodes fourteen panels I
believe are on the same substrate not on
opposite substrates it's they're more
about that in the video but I invite you
to watch the T inverse IPS first OLED
videos that I have on the crash course
in minute science playlist so there's
more info there about them love the
shirts though Greg got black though got
black though one
sitting in a black shirt oh you got
black oh is that the guy who bought one
wasn't awesome no regrets that was like
30 people bottom so 30 people bought
shirts yeah they won't mine
wait no seriously 30 people watch shirts
shirts no one was us that was a good
game we'll break like one line I bring
30 mclubbe okay look alright people keep
working up in the club in McLovin has
his own channel go to his channel and
tell him to do stuff to like make more
you know we should like I should
screenshot Jacob Cermak Lovins snapchat
and they put it on stream and let
everybody out about snapchat that's what
I should do is a good spam alright
everyone pull up your snapchats Will's
gonna post Jacobs a little like snap ID
thing just spam him like we want him to
get like a hundred notifications at
least from people following him he's
gonna wonder what happened I'd be pretty
funny
ruiner XL says I've heard we're on the
verge of seeing 4k i PSG Singh 144 Hertz
for a millisecond displays I'm sure I'm
sure they've already been invented
there's not consumer level yet and I'm
sure they're gonna be $2,000 plus let's
see will can never replace McLovin dang
will it's getting personal
someone's like like who uses snapchat
anymore yeah I have to yeah I have to
get more involved with snapchat because
that's one of the things that I that I
made is like a tear thing for patreon
like it's one of the things like they
can snapchat me and I'll snapchat them
but I don't use it enough yet I gotta
get more involved 1080 TIR wait for 1180
volta I can to that question Bobby if
you want it now buy it now if you want
to wait wait it's it's a question you
only you can answer D recommend 4k
gaming or 1440p as of right now the best
value option is 1440p look when you're
sitting three feet from your screen
you're not going to know the difference
between 4k and 1440p I'm sorry unless
you get close to your screen they look
identical so you're going to be able to
benefit from the higher refresh rates
and
less like graphics overhead involved
with the lower resolution it's gonna be
a lot cheaper and honestly I mean you
can get so much more packed into it if
you go 1440 you know Andrews just
pledged five bucks on patreon thanks
brother
appreciate that was Andrew that's Neil
injuries I don't know how this works
oh I don't know I don't think it matters
Volta probably won't be out for at least
four months yeah it's just speculation
at this point 21 by nine or 14 for 144
Hertz you can get both actually I do 21
by nine and I have a hundred Hertz panel
and I think 100 Hertz is still plenty
like it's not as good as 1440p or 14 144
Hertz gosh so many numbers but it's
close no that's not that right McLovin
snapchat here yeah oh yeah spam him yeah
everybody add and this is McLovin
snapchat so if you want you want a back
you gotta tell them oh yeah he's gonna
get so lit please add him please do it
does he have like one of those things
where he has to accept friend requests
or I hope it's just open he's gonna be
even if he has to add you back I think
you can still send him one he's gonna
he's gonna love it
just just go ham no more asked what
camera I use I use a G 85 and I'll see
yous an F Z 1000 what's your guy's
snapchat I don't I have a company
snapchat ceiling one I have but it's for
patreon donors I mean you just donate
like a book and you get access to it but
it's like more behind-the-scenes stuff
because I post there I try to post her
as much as I can but I honestly forget
about it a lot of times you know any but
it's what's the Holy Grail here it's
gonna be on snapchat I'm pretty boring
so yeah yeah will will literally like
every time I call him he's either
sleeping or in front of his PC which i
think is cool but you know guys it's
really mine to that's what's so sad I
don't get out and do much anymore Bob
Flanders appreciate that donation my man
yo Greg what's happening it's just
another one of those nights you know
like I just finished up a video it's
rendering
it's about to render and then I thought
I'd be up tomorrow I think we got merch
yeah so it's nice bye
yeah yeah get this t-shirt t-shirt why
this one
yeah don't buy will Humphreys you know
where things yeah there's no point in it
like it's just to be honest so cool
people like whose will Humphreys and you
could say I have absolutely no idea I
know but then everyone's gonna know will
because they'll all see you shirts right
yeah if somebody buys one in the next
ten minutes and I'll send you a $10
Starbucks gift card yeah what's up
Daniel
E how's it going moogan tech y'all all
you all get into crypto Kryptos he
spelled it interestingly no I don't get
into it we'll Devil's it will has some
interest in it but I don't touch it it's
just too hostile at this point yeah we
show you guys my coin base but I'm kind
of scared so yeah you can overclock
monitors most people don't know this but
you can you can overclock well I
wouldn't say most people you can
overclock most sixty Hertz monitors to
about 70 or so some he says this snap is
open spamming pics now oh great so I
want to get his reaction that would've
been really good industries CPU is is
bien or GPU wait what caramely gonna be
would be nonsense we definitely get the
144 Hertz yeah I did
it's night and day I would pick the
higher refresh rate over the higher
resolution any day of the week because
past a certain viewing distance those
resolutions are gonna look identical
science to do t-shirt which I bought as
shouted out by a will or a card I cannot
use anywhere in Netherlands trucker bomb
appreciate the donation
I am a $20 a month patreon you know I'm
still sending money here look look at
that dedication you guys see we could
never not that we would ever expect this
but especially in our current state we
couldn't expect people to do this for us
so we really appreciate that and we hope
that we're bringing you content that you
guys actually enjoy
because if you don't end up enjoying it
in the long run then this channel will
die and then will and I will well will
already has other jobs but I'll have to
find a job somewhere else
heck yeah man vis vo put the camera on
either of you yeah will why are we still
on the merch shirt on the merch page
well I'm gonna click the button bro
dang it will since white can't have nice
things you need to have an auto switch
is it auto switching or not yeah it is
Mathew merch and Donny
oh that's that's that's the tallien it
sounds like merchandani it's a cool last
name I'm getting error code CPU DXE
initiation is started on my gigabyte
five mobo with i-580 600 K I think it's
my ripped off series 5 RAM PC working
fine of my knowledge thoughts error code
is that a blue screen of death is that
where you're getting a BS OD or it's
just like your splash screen when you
put up your PC or what is it preventing
you from turning on your computer let me
know you don't the donator you need our
attention I'll look for you but you're
in yeah just start just start plugging
one in at a time and switch slots I have
a video actually on that and you'll know
right away it also could be a CPU issue
your CPU could and it could be
interfering with your your channels so
you never know oh yeah that's right hold
on my mic good good job appreciate that
hey are your shirts one size smaller
like if I buy a large will it be a
medium no it shouldn't either American
sizes so they're probably too big
mirdon these are American sizes I know
that after December 14th I won't be able
to afford to go on YouTube so I'll
comment while I can left your channel
since 30k appreciate that common sense
and I don't know I like will says I
don't know if net neutrality is if we
lose it here in the States
I don't think that right away we're
gonna start noticing things all right
out right off the bat right well you
were saying that's gonna take a slow
like program I think it'll be I think
it'll be years before you really feel
effectiveness actually cuz you know if
it was needle it's not socially
acceptable right now to offer like a
Netflix only plan you know yeah that
makes sense so it you know and that
thing into is if
and they're all gonna have to agree to
do it at the same time right all the big
ISPs because if you have if you live in
a place where you have multiple ISP
switch you're in luck then they would
have to kind of essentially team up and
say hey we're gonna start running these
like you know tier based subscriptions
for different webs web access and we
want to know if you want to do the same
thing we want to wrote at the same time
so there will be some kind of
cooperation they're more than likely
because if one company does it the other
doesn't everyone's gonna jump ship and
go to the other guy that's not doing it
so we'll see
ISPs don't censor Google does oh yeah
yeah so I must confess the first video I
saw of yours was the NZXT Hugh fiasco
yeah yeah that's one of my one of my
darker videos but I'm good bro hey man
these people know you know like I
screwed up big-time I'm sure I'm not the
only person who's done it I love how
people were always like oh you should
have paid attention you should it's so
obviously you should have checked it
like a bunch of captain hindsight it's
in the comments and was just like okay
like obviously I know you can't cross
fricking cables every if you look at the
backs of power supplies that are modular
they all have different ports on there
like all the different pins are
completely switched around it really
just depends on how it's all laid out in
the PSU so the fact that it fit I just
kind of I thought it was the right cable
I didn't realize that I had the wrong
cable out there but that's what happens
that's what happens when you mix it up
cables it says Jack ale yep humans never
make mistakes ever yeah I mean I
couldn't say anything to I'm like there
were a few haters in there and it's just
like I can't say anything I mean like I
had to own up to it and it's really all
I can say what's a good 1080p high
refresh rate monitored by let me just
google it there's so many out there dude
just type in 1080p 144 Hertz and just
pick the one that's the cheapest one
brand that you trust
Greg it's not showing you in my YouTube
feed help freaking YouTube man it's that
freaking YouTube that's what it is you
it's it's just shafting us our channel
right now is getting pretty hit it's
getting hit pretty hard by the algo like
our our view counts have been heaven
down noticeably down so it's just kind
of like she's got a truck through
you know it'll get better eventually but
you just got to keep going yeah like
something or there's 354 up votes but
only 100 people watching so they did
thanks but I don't know yeah we
literally started the livestream and
then five or ten minutes later we had
190 uploads so it was kind of strange
thoughts on getting a software
engineering degree I think you're gonna
have a very future-proofed career so I
think it's a good choice it's honestly a
lot of that's beyond me that's more of
will valley but it's a good degree for
sure those guys were smart in my school
they knew what they were doing what's up
gentlemen
John Meharry John McCreary how you say
it McCreary mice tricks cards
overheating in the define C case do you
have any suggestions on case fans I
really like silent wings three fans so
if you want something that doesn't look
ugly that'll match the case then you can
go with the silent least three 120 mil
or 140 depending on your AIO
config Ram pricing is getting a wild man
about a new 32 gig kit yeah I bet I bet
for that 32 gig kit you probably paid
250 300 bucks for it
isn't that it's not ridiculous it's just
do this guy said I had pompadour here oh
that's me pompadour a pompadour here no
he said will well your will has
pompadour here I don't think I know my
hair is popular but it just does that I
don't do it on purpose and I just need a
hair go that one about new Corsair ello
series fan and have the four pin
connections and the motherboard myself
with a set fan speed linked to ten point
two volts however it looks like the fans
been slower than faster what you mean
like it's it's fluctuating if it's PWM
control just gonna fluctuate but I don't
know exactly what you're asking about on
your hardware supposed to set speed oh
yeah how's he saying they're fluctuating
yeah so you're probably gonna have to
make sure that it's either set to PWM or
DC I would assume PWM and just keep it
locked turn-off smart fan if you have a
smart fan button there turn that off
because smart fans gonna vary it
according to cpu or motherboard
temperatures we ever go to an event to
meet up with fans we don't live in an
area where many fans other than the ones
who went to school with us know us or
live
a guy at Walmart the other day though
yeah I did there's a guy Walmart is a
younger kid he's like 14 15 he uh he he
noticed Samantha that was really cool
and weird cuz I didn't expect anyone a
Walmart across the street to be like hey
you're from science to do not be like
hey Greg I need from school like he
actually only knew me from the chat
which was really strange but I thought I
was really cool too is really humbling
you mean you wish you bought a lot of
kits trucker you could have easily
doubled that hmm forward slash high-five
air 66 on debug LED reads Momo CXC DXE
PC boots and I'm having no performance
issues again to my knowledge that's a
yes to that will I think we're gonna
have to mmm having a performance issues
I don't know what I don't know what
that's about maybe it's if it's sticking
on 66 the whole time then maybe there's
an issue but if it's just flash into 66
and then flashing away from it then it's
probably just checking it out know if I
would say it's an error it just depends
and it's it's probably just a check
sequence because you'll see it flash
through a bunch of different numbers dr.
D bugs do so it's doing that it's
checking all those to make sure that
they're that they're functioning
properly so I wouldn't say it's an issue
as long as your PC seems to be running
fine I wouldn't I wouldn't worry about
it have you tried the new Firefox nope
Chrome fo lyfe because I just know
Chrome just comfortable with it what's
up Pizza gamer PC gamers one of our long
he's been a long subscriber and he's
also been a long patreon donor as well
so I appreciate him a lot actually
played a couple games with him - hey
Greg do you have any theories and why
you and other tech tumors are being hit
by the monetization algorithm crap I
feel bad for you man I don't know I
think it's just our time you know like a
bunch of the other channels already been
hit by it and they've already complained
about it and now it's our time to be hit
and complain about it about it probably
has something to do with keywords and
just yeah we're very seasonal in the
sense that a lot of people look for us
in Christmastime it just makes more
sense right but I'm really worried about
January February because that's when
everything starts to taper off people
aren't looking up tech much anymore
because they already have the tech
and that that's where I'm really
wondering how things are gonna hold up
for channels around my size or a little
smaller to be interesting
we're gets a couple more questions not
gonna hang out too long it's been about
an hour so but this is one of those
where we just like we don't know exactly
what to talk about so we'll just answer
questions and put some clickbait in the
title because that's the normal thing to
do with a live stream well how you doing
over there oh good I'm kind of confused
this guy just putting a bunch of plus
works I'm just kidding but our Fox works
fast I haven't actually tried it yeah I
have a neither I mean anything that's
not Chrome I just I get scared I don't
like change or no one took youtubers
getting hit yeah they are yep they are
any anybody between like two hundred and
seven hundred thousand probably yeah
yeah I would say the ones who were but
yeah I'd say the ones who were at 700 K
and up they're doing really well there's
kind of like there was the first wave
right a lot of tech tuber started around
20 2008 2009 right right after YouTube
got big and then the second wave was
like 2012 and then now we're in the
third wave the third wave is 2015 to
2017 and it's just getting so saturated
and I think the algorithm is really
struggling to prioritize content not
only from a view basis but also from a
sub basis and and from just a bunch of
other stuff maybe CPM plays a role as
well and I know that the advertiser
floods are really throwing things off
for Google so you never know with a pool
you're wearing your gun in the mail yeah
yeah so this polo here I'm kind of
hiding it but this is like just a
generic science tell um I think is kind
of in the way a generic science studio
t-shirt or polo with the YouTube logo on
there I think it's really nice it feels
really comfortable makes you look like
bigger alright cuz it just fits your
body so well and these were actually
made by Tony
marilla TPC Kustoms whoa can you type in
his YouTube account and put that in the
description
he Tony made the t-shirts and he
apparently like I think is one of his
family members is like a an embroiderer
or whatever
and he sent these along with some really
dope cables that you guys will get to
see and a build coming very soon that we
featured at CES and he he's made a lot
of cables for us in the past but he does
a lot of really cool custom loops on his
channel I don't know if he's watching
right now but um he's he's been a really
good friend and he supported me a lot
and he's probably done twice as much for
me as I've done for him or been able to
do for him but uh he's a really cool guy
it is I'm gonna type his name in so if
you guys want to see customs that is
Tony and there's a one in there so mine
the one it might be earlier I'm kind of
I have to check for a Liddy
maybe I just butchered it oh I think I
did butcher I put the one in the wrong
place for ility PC customs I think it'd
be typed in like that that would still
come up yeah this is the one here I'm
gonna link its channel for you guys
ah da boom boom if if just show Tony
some love Tony's a really cool guy he
loves what he does too so uh Karim Ali
q6 600 what's up at that man why you
saying q6 600 so much how much for that
CPU like I don't know 20 bucks 30 like
not even that I don't know I'd say
around 20 dollars its CES only for
people that have connections with tech
companies now you can go to CES and
enjoy everything there I mean like if I
feel like if we even if we didn't have
connections with tech companies we would
still still try to make an effort to go
because there are so many opportunities
for people who don't already have
connections with tech companies that you
could start up and any kind of you know
like set those fires ablaze if you if
you meet people in their right context
what we have here in Z gems I have heard
the Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
will crash so if you own any bitcoins
now it's time to sell our what are your
thoughts no clue really just gonna
depend I mean the markets been going up
and down like crazy so uh your best
guess is good well I've got to say is
that nobody nobody believed it when
when it was 2009-2010 nobody you told
him you were playing with bitcoins
everyone told you you're an idiot but uh
I don't know I don't know what that
means but you know yeah well doesn't
know what that means
well will will dabbled a little bit
Nesta he's interested in all that stuff
more than I am I I just I don't know
I've never really gotten into a lot
people ask me if I want to do crypto
mining and whatnot I just don't think
it's worth the hassle I never understood
your i5 6600 K review is it good or know
what off right now in this context no I
would go for the 80 600 K over the 6600
K prices have completely changed so any
i5 is good for gaming just like buying
and selling domains back in the day ooh
what like there in the tech bubble I
read before the tech bubble is the crack
in X 62 - 80 millimeter is that is
indeed big for Mini ITX oh yeah
any recommendations on cheap used GPUs
for horizon build cheap and used GTX 780
you can go for like some r9 380 s maybe
even like r9 you know nano 390 390x you
can probably some old r9 290 s -
something along those lines and then you
could go as far back with it with Nvidia
as maybe uh six six hundred six series
maybe I don't know like 660 around there
I don't know it's pretty old but that's
about as far back as I would go
I don't think Greg was born when the
domain hostage crisis was going on well
you know about that yeah you we were
born but we weren't I mean no that's -
yeah we were like five years old
right before the tech bubble I mean
looking back on it yeah I I know
generally why the market crashed the way
it did and it's over speculated over
speculation but I have an old domain
that I bought the first I mean about was
in 2007 but I like refused to it's a
pointless domain but I refused to let it
go just because like the Whois has 2007
on just about a bunch of computer parts
to build my sister PC for the holidays
and ran was $99 for a single stick it
we're gonna end it on that bombshell
folks Ram prices suck right now and
that's pretty much just all we can
really say just hold on
things would get better they will have
better faster RAM that won't make a lick
of difference in any gaming situation at
least on Intel aside thanks to ring bus
and we'll we'll catch you next week I
guess we need to actually have a plan a
game plan next week if we're gonna do
this again I had 17 that's right we
might leave for Germany so yeah we're
gonna have some good stuff for you so
stay tuned we appreciate all of you who
decided to stop by this night for the
live stream every Sunday night at 9:00
p.m. I don't think we're gonna do one
over the Christmas break but maybe entry
9 p.m. Central
yeah that's at 10:00 p.m. Eastern at 7
p.m. Pacific and then wherever else you
are in the world just do a little mask
is I'm not that I don't I don't know all
those time zones by heart but we're
gonna get out of here will you have any
last last thoughts to go buy yourself a
sound studio t-shirt that's my voice
yeah go buy yourself a science studio
t-shirt just go to science got studio
forward slash merch do it just do it
you're gonna like the design it was a
contest we had and we picked out that
that drawing or not that drawing but
that design is the winner I think his
name is Mohammed and he he kind of just
came up with this from scratch and I
really like the idea behind it yeah yeah
we got extra small all the way to 3x oh
so yeah so yeah it's pretty basically
gonna fit any human form factor at all
they should be good and you're gonna
look good wearing it cuz I mean come on
it's Ryan's Dean what's a will shirt
it's right below it bro right here cop
that will shirt do it yeah I'll give you
10 bucks for the first one he knew it
when he type that in Ryan you committed
bro contract someone says blue snowball
or blue Yeti pleuity sounds better just
straight up man sighs there you go
thanks dudes for LGA 775 idea
all right folks we're gonna leave it
there you go we'll Humphreys ID will
dings t-shirts we've got science to do
t-shirts be sure to check both of those
out again we'll post a link one more
time there for those who missed it
before if you want to buy some
just in time or just after the holiday
season there you go
science that studio forward slash merch
did I do something wrong is that why
mine is not hyperlinking and i just
spamming a bunch I didn't do HTTP that's
why I always forget that awesome hope
you guys enjoy it we will catch you next
time for another science to do after
hours</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
