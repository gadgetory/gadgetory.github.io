big companies do find new ways to make
money I like to look at all CEOs the
same way I look at mr. wonderful from
Shark Tank when it's all said and done
the only thing that truly matters for
you and your company is money and as a
CEO if you're not making your
shareholders in particular money they
will kick you off the chair so what has
been vidya done by releasing their new
Titan X lowercase P now let's talk about
the name for a second yeah the Titan X
lowercase P and then year before that we
have the Titan X P which is still based
on Pascal architecture but disabled a
few more cores and any other Titan X
which was the original Maxwell base -
Titan X so I don't know why they're
doing that but that's how it is so when
I address the Titan X P from now on I'm
going to emphasize lowercase P because
that's really all we have to go off of
at this point the green team has created
artificial competition within their own
fan base which is a really good thing
from a marketing standpoint because
either way you're going to be making
money and to be fair the red team does
the exact same thing the releases of the
RX 480 and the RX 470 created a sort of
artificial competition for AMD and if
you think about it and they're not far
off in terms of performance but the
prices do differ somebody's more
concerned about price will choose the
470 someone who just wants as much power
as they can get from the new Polaris
architecture will choose the 480 you
might have noticed that you were
engaging in that artificial competition
that they created but it does help a
company like AMD and it certainly helps
Nvidia as well and this is exactly what
prompted Nvidia to release the new Titan
X lowercase P it's kind of saying that
comically at this point because they
need to come up with new names for these
cards and as a disclaimer there is no
official GTX in front of the Titan X
lowercase P's named because they want to
make sure that you know that this card
is not targeted toward the general
consumer this is a very special card
meant for the most avid content creators
and whatever designers out there
whatever would motivate you to buy
something this ridiculously expensive is
who they want to target but that's the
point
they're creating the competition by
making it so exclusive or by at least
claim that it is let's look at this from
an economic perspective the release of
the gtx 1080i which mind you is the most
powerful consumer grade graphics card
you can currently buy from the Green
Team wipe to the floor with the Titan X
capital P from a price to performance
standpoint demand for the GTX 10 atti
skyrocketed upon launch they were
selling out everywhere which is exactly
what they expected especially given the
price point but because it directly
competes with the Titan X capital
P its demand sharply sell so this is the
Enigma if we assume a fixed supply the
10 ATT is demand would fall if they
raise price which would actually be an
okay thing they would still probably
meet the same profit margins that
they're seeing now it would just reduce
the amount of demand in the overall
stress on companies to manufacture these
cards or they could just completely
lower the price of the Titan XP to some
ridiculous amount say like five hundred
bucks which would never happen because
the Titan X series is in videos
top-of-the-line car that you can buy
that's not a Quadro card and then if we
look at the third option they could
introduce a new card and that's where
the Titan X lowercase P comes into play
you see Nvidia knows no matter what
there will always be a very small niche
group of people who will want the
biggest and the best out there
regardless of what they currently have
even if they have to 1080 T eyes they're
going to still go for that one Titan X
lowercase P because it is the biggest in
the baddest and they want to be able to
say that they have the biggest and the
baddest that is logic that's how people
work it's actually psychology so instead
of raising prices there 1080 T is which
let's be honest wouldn't be look
unfavorably by a majority of the gaming
community Nvidia decided to release an
even more powerful card the Titan X is
over KSP and here's the catch they know
people will pay a hefty penny for it
because it is the best card currently
available by any manufacturer of any
graphics card ever in existence and the
other catch they didn't have too much
research or thought into it all they did
was enable a few extra cores that is
genius that is a definition of marketing
ploy now I want to reiterate the fact
that this is not me going after the
green team okay they're all guilty of
this in some way or another the red team
the green team the blue team
they're all the same when it comes to
marketing at the end of the day they all
want to maximize profits that's how they
stay in power that's how they keep
making money that's every major
corporation in America for that matter
and every major company I would say in
the free world I just figured I would
make this video to enlighten you on
what's going on under the table if
you're questioning release appetite next
lowercase P now you know why we like
this video be sure to give it a thumbs
up thumbs down for the opposite click
