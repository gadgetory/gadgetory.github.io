ready to get right into the Walter White
three bill blog so without further ado I
present the finale and the finished
product what's up everyone welcome to
part two of the Walter White three build
log this was actually supposed to be the
end of part two but as you'll see here
shortly I have a problem with just a
very small leak somewhere in the
reservoir I'm pretty sure it's coming
from Oh taught me see where it's already
stained the the whites just kind of like
top here of the reservoir I'm going to
try to clean that off but there's a leak
somewhere behind here I don't I'm not
sure if it's the the little cap that I
have on the opposite side opening over
here or if I'm missing an o-ring up top
or what so we're going to drain this
entire loop and find the source of the
leak it's somewhere back there I'm not
I'm not exactly sure if it's coming from
the opening or if it's coming from the
seal we'll figure that out right now so
here's something you might find
interesting I have one of the ports on
the bottom of the reservoir just a small
little tube here that runs to a valve
that acts as my drain valve so all I
need to do as long as I have an opening
up top which will allow air to slow down
and kind of push the fluid into this
bottle here is just turn the dial you
can see fluid flows there we go start
draining okay so what I've done here
I've taken apart the radiator reservoir
combo took it out of the loop so the
link nothing loop right now it's just
has one Bend from the GPU to the CPU
block and I actually disassembled the
reservoir blocks on both the top and
bottom and swapped out the o-ring
configuration so the way that pretty
much will has you do it they have you
put two o-rings inside these little
white basically fasteners here and those
two o-rings are supposed to prevent
fluid from leaking out the bottom of
this acrylic and out through the gaps
and I believe that's why we were getting
liquid build-up here
because liquid was somehow getting
through those o-rings passing between
those o-rings and the acrylic cylinder
itself I think the way I have it set up
now the fluid won't be able to get
through I mean that's the point after
all you don't want leaks in the system
so we're going to try this configuration
out see if it works
I don't think this is mandated by primo
chill but it wasn't working the way that
it was set up originally so we're going
to try something
and see if it holds up
you
all right so I want to point out that I
removed the rear 120 grad few of you
pointed out that it was covering up this
this dim here on the far left so I just
took it out all together it will make
the run simpler as well so we'll only
need four cents of tubing instead of
would it be six which which is nice it
makes things easier in a sense we don't
have to worry about piping moving over
here but because we're going to have
more empty space I want to do something
kind of crazy here I want to do like a
helix twist or something or have one go
up and and down and the other one do the
opposite I don't know something crazy to
kind of fill up this gap so we're going
to have we already have this one and
this leads up to the top of the
reservoir we have the tube in the back
that I showed you earlier that runs up
into the radiator so the fluids got a
cub sorry from from up here to the CPU
now I wanted to feed the CPU first so
this tube is going to you know do
something crazy right when it gets to
this point either loop around or I don't
know just just something something weird
you know something that looks cool it
did just like is the signature signature
move for this build
okay
okay and while the PC is priming I just
have the pump turned on obviously the
rest of computer's not on because power
supply is not installed yet we're going
to do that we're going to install a see
Sonic focus 851 FX fully modular power
supply if you aren't familiar with see
Sonic specifically they actually
manufacture quite a few power supplies
that are rebranded by other companies
including Corsair coolermaster EVGA c
sonic is one of the best out there check
this out see sonic also includes their
own zip ties that are branded by them
which looks super cool they also include
zip ties just for regular cable
management you don't with super fancy
with these here and you also get your
for standard psu screws as well as a
cool focus branded sticker now one of
the huge selling points of this
particular unit from C sonic is the fact
that it is actually super compact so
it's a full sized ATX PSU no doubt but
it's not very lengthy meaning it won't
take up a lot of space in your basement
which is good if you have hard drive
trays or if you have something like a
pump in Walter White threes case so we
can actually put this in even the most
compact case and still have plenty of
room for cables to be stored and for
hard drives and whatnot so I really like
the fact that it's super compact it's
also very efficient - at 80 plus gold
and another important attribute worth
mentioning this is a fully modular power
supply so we only have to install what
cables we do need for our particular
build the cables themselves included in
the box are also black sleeved and the
cables are black as well so no ugly
ketchup and mustard combos so our
computer has been probably for about
thirty minutes or so I'm confident
enough in my own abilities to bend and
connect tubing and whatnot I'm gonna
call this good enough I don't see any
leaks and I don't think it's going to
leak anytime soon
given the lay of this setup now but if
this is your first time building
something similar to this I do recommend
you just powering the pump like I've
done here
don't power anything else in the system
because if something does leak they'll
damage those components so just keep the
pump on for about 24 hours or so come
back the next day if you still don't
have any leaks then you should be good
to go for you know quite a while but in
30 minutes I'm confident enough I'm
going to go install the power supply so
we're going to turn this off and
actually turn the entire computer on now
Wow this is the biggest buzzkill ever
crabby tempered glass sticker it's all
this residue on the glass itself when
you pull it off so this build was
extremely complicated frustrating not
only technically but just because I had
a few issues that were expected that
really shouldn't have happened in the
first place that made this build take
much longer than it should have I would
have been done by day three if it wasn't
for the issues that I had one of which
you saw in the previous footage in this
video but you didn't see something else
I didn't film this because I was just so
angry that it happened and I was just
worried about fixing it as quickly as I
could and it's difficult for me to say
this because pre Mitchell is a major
sponsor of this video series so they
sent $1,000 worth of custom gear here
they they really hooked us up but I
cannot hide the fact that the d5 pump
they sent was dead on arrival I can
confirm that because not only did I swap
that pump with another d5 pump and that
one worked perfectly fine but also
because I swapped the power supplies too
to make sure what there's power supply
and compatibility something weird like
that I narrow down all the variables
I made sure this thing was dead and it
was it was just kept clicking like there
was a relay or something clicking in
there but it actually wasn't powering on
so no fluid was being churned in the
loop that's an issue because you
obviously need to move to take that heat
away from your CPU and GPU heat sources
so I had to drain this build not once
but twice unexpectedly because of two
issues that really shouldn't have
happened the first being that the pump
died the second being that the reservoir
itself was leaking especially from the
top it did leak from the bottom slightly
as well and I'm not sure if this was
just because the o-rings weren't
positioned correctly or if I didn't
tighten the seals all the way I torque
those things those things were on there
but nonetheless fluids still managed to
find its way out of the reservoir and
into just the open space in the case
that's not good at all you don't want to
leak period because I could damage other
components in your PC and another thing
premature I think that the flow chart
even clued on your website along with
the installation pictures are not doing
this thing justice I think that you are
confusing the consumer by showing
arbitrary pictures and labeling things
but not showing which orient
from what you're looking at the
reservoir also you mislabeled something
here this should say I think the
opposite because you're saying that both
ports are the intake that doesn't make
any sense at all that confuse me I was
kind of questioning whether or not I
even had the intake port on the right
side or the outtake port on the right
side so I think that that needs to be a
bit more clear that can confuse
consumers I was worried about that but
everything else that I have to say about
pretty much chill is positive so I had a
do a pump and I don't really know if you
can just blame pretty much specifically
for that because they don't manufacture
they don't build the pump so they just
rebrand the pump so it's kind of luck of
the draw just happened to be that I got
a dead pump and that's kind of expected
I guess at this point on the channel but
I would like to say I'm a huge fan of
the premotor revolver fittings I think
those are the best fittings period
hands down they're well-designed they're
easy to use they look awesome you can
get them in whatever color you want
practically you know just a single or in
between the fitting cap and the fitting
itself the G quarter fittings will
connect to whatever else you want to
integrate into your loop so huge thumbs
up for me in that respect I recommend
promotional fittings over any other
things I've used to date the other thing
I want to mention the reservoir pump
combo looks really cool I think that
pretty much is done a great job kind of
incorporating the two into a single unit
I usually pumps or combine with some
huge block followed by the reservoir on
top and you just see a bunch of that
block that you don't that's not
appealing doesn't look very good over
this case you see pretty much all the
fluid that's it you won't even know
there's a pump attached you would think
it was a separate unit somewhere else in
the loop so I think it done a great job
there aesthetically as well as
functionally the fluid doesn't have a
problem moving through the loop as is
apart from that though you already know
how the i-9 is doing it's running really
hot despite having a custom loop in here
the CPU is still running at around 80 85
degrees Celsius under load and that's
only at a four point two gigahertz
overclock in a V core of one point one
so yeah I mean you boost that to four
point six and one point two five and the
thing probably hits 95 96 degrees
Celsius and starts thermal throttling so
this is pretty much the barrier here
getting a 10 core CPU at 4.2 gigahertz
in itself is impressive but four point
six is really pushing it most a iOS
can't handle it and even
to move like this with a single 360
millimeter rad is barely enough you
could say if it's throttling it's not
enough period the pump is just not able
to keep up with the amount of heat being
dumped by that CPU now many of you have
asked what on earth I do with these pcs
once I put them together like where do
they go into the ether they just
disappear do I use them personally for a
long time usually a bit of both
obviously the latter followed by the
former so I'll use this PC for maybe a
week or two and then I'll tear it down
that's about how long it'll last maybe
two weeks now recycle these parts look
it's no simple task for any company big
or small to spend a thousand dollars
worth of components especially you know
custom loot gear like this to a tech
reviewer so I'm going to take advantage
of these parts as much as I can before
something new is released and then I
will put together a new build with new
or primo chill parts but for now this
stuff is excellent I recommend it all
you can find it all linked in the video
description by the way along with the
fan tech CPU and graphics card blocks
those are also beautiful that that's
what you're saying in there those are
lit up themselves they have LED strips
RGB integration all built into those
blocks which is really nice for the next
PC build on the channel we're going to
stick with AMD Rison they're trying to
put something together for under $1000
it should be a solid 1080p and 1440p
gamer along with a decent video content
creation editor all that stuff pretty
much an all-around excellent PC
especially for the price so we're going
to try to do one that's not called a
budget PC but it all around solid PC for
under $1000 stay tuned for that on the
channel also an excellent case coming
from fractal design I don't know I got
hot randomly CPUs it like 74 degrees
that's normal for an i9 that's pretty
normal but anyway with that if you liked
it be sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs
down for the opposite click a subscribe
button if you have it alright now catch
you in the next video we got a monitor
from Ben Q on the review next
this is science studio thanks for
building with us
