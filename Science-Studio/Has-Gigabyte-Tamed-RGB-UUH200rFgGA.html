about a year or so ago at this point we
have RGB SSDs RGB power supplies cases
motherboards graphics cards coolers and
a ram and certain thing I missed here
this excludes all peripherals by the way
and at this point to be honest it's
difficult for anything associated with
RGB to stand out anymore because
everything basically is I think the
original intention behind it was to
allow folks to choose one or two unique
colors it characterized a build but it
seems as though a majority of people are
comfortable leaving things in the
rainbow puke config this in particular
is a difficult thing to make look not
annoying in my opinion it requires a
sort of subtle approach one that doesn't
really overwhelm the viewer and as the
title of this video suggests I actually
think gigabytes done just that so what
am I talking about we flew to Miami this
past weekend for gigabyte showcase and
full disclosure upfront our travel
expenses were covered by the company but
we weren't paid anything to cover the
event and we are not being paid to
create this video so no money at all
exchanged hands I just wanted to fly us
out there to show us the new stuff
they're offering so I want to make this
video to kind of give you a guess a
sample of what to expect from gigabyte
and I expect we'll be doing this for
other companies as well in the future so
kind of a preliminary lineup here
regarding Z 390 and the r-tx lamp so
starting first with the motherboards
gigabytes taken a unique approach as to
how they rank and characterize their
products so for Z 390 you'll find that a
vast majority of their Oris boards are
actually utilizing the exact same double
twelve phase power to live respect
meaning you shouldn't expect any loss in
overclocking potential regardless of the
board you pick and the money you spend
on that or sports ultimately the goal
here is to simplify the choice for
consumers to more pertinent
specifications like onboard Wi-Fi
crossfire and SLI support MDOT to
support RGB styling and ultimately price
in fact the only noteworthy exceptions
to this rule are the Auris extreme and
ITX offerings the former of which boasts
a killer 16 phase 60 and BRM stack with
ir35 201 but controllers in charge of
stepping down voltage so when it comes
to motherboard V RMS this is among the
best
in the business but the board itself
will cost over 500 USD so that kind of
sucks comparable in stats to the msi SD
390 god-like board so if you want the
best in the business again you'll have
to pay up though I think a vast majority
of consumers will be happy with other
the Auris master at 289 or the Auris pro
at a more comfortable 189 I also think
the RGB effects on these boards look
quite nice
these things are diffused beautifully
and you can get these features in any of
the Auris boards currently offered
though you could settle for gigabyte
variants at lower prices if you are
interested the RGB effects there are
much more subtle but the product that
had us all drooling is event I mean
seriously every media guy there was into
filming this one specific product here
was the Horus r-tx 2080 card this shroud
will be implemented into all three
models by the way the 2080 ti 2080 and
2070 the styling this time around is
much less industrial emphasizing sharper
edges and RGB bling my favorite part
these fan LED so they work off of
believe it or not just a single LED each
one fan blade in each section or each
fan has a built in RGB LED that can be
controlled via gigabyte software when
the fan spins this one LED appears to
cover the entire circumference of the
fan design it's difficult to convey via
camera due to shutter speed issues but I
can't assure you that this thing looks
incredible in person every media
attendee like I said was captured by
this aesthetic it's such a classy look
in an industry filled with RGB law in
addition to this accent you'll find the
colors extend it to the Auris logos both
on the side and top behind the backplate
assuming you opt for the extreme variant
I find the logo up top to be a bit of a
waste though because a car like this
should definitely sit with a vertical
mount to show off these fans the effects
that can be applied to these by the way
are practically endless which is also
hard for me to believe because this is
just a single LED / fan doing all these
different designs so the LEDs are
flashing super fast back and forth to
create some of the designs that you're
seeing here and apart from the designs
themselves the card also sports an
alternate spinning center fan which hew
bite says results in a more effective
distribution of air through the shroud
expect the two 8-pin supplemental power
connectors by the way on these things
and a solid cooling solution underneath
for temps in the mid 60's under an
overclocked load and I haven't tested
this card personally but those
seemed about right because Turing is
pretty much predictable at this point
from a thermal perspective it is more
power limited than anything else which
is a bit disappointing so this is just a
small recap of what we saw in Miami from
gigabyte and I do plan on saving the
remainder of screen time for when we
actually have some of these products in
hand to test and benchmark especially
that worse extreme card will get more
shots of that I was kind of support I
couldn't get as much mural as I wanted
to show you guys there's all the
different effects that you could run
with that card it does look really good
in person I think that's one of the
things that's really gonna come down to
at the end of the day is how good the
card looks because like I said all our
TX cards for the most part are going to
perform comparably because none of them
run really hot at least the third-party
coolers maybe with a custom PCBs so stay
tuned for that stay tuned for ae3 9t
coverage when we finally get our hands
on some Intel CPU samples maybe we gotta
just buy our own I think at this point
we'll probably have to do and you'll see
this videos on channel very soon thumbs
up you like this one thumbs down for the
Queen opposite feeling click the red
