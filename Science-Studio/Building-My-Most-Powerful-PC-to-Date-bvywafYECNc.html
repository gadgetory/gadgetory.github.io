the studio finally and I want to give
you an update and kind of talk about
what I'm going to do in this video for
progress on the most powerful build I've
ever put together build I don't have a
name for it yet so leave a suggestion in
the comments below as for now I have
plans to include two gtx 1080s these are
the same 1080s that i've used in past
bills these things do wonders for me I
love having to I don't have many
problems at all with SLI and I love
these blocks from Thermaltake now the
pump we're gonna be using another
thermaltake this is like a d5 housing
from Thermaltake and it's got four ports
in total you can actually include a
fifth port down at the bottom but you
really can't use it if you're gonna have
it be a standalone pump and that's
exactly what were gonna do we're gonna
shove it underneath the basement where
you can't see it we do have this wide
opening here in the fractal design to
find six to take advantage of I have on
the ground here this is a 240mm radiator
and we're gonna include this one in
tandem with the 360 mul rad we have up
top I think though the way I had it set
up this was gonna be an exhaust config
up top but I think just because I'm
worried about like having negative like
too much negative air pressure in here I
think what we're gonna do is have this
be an intake setup so it's completely
fine because we do have a huge dust
filter spending the top of the case so
if I turn these these fans around but
they basically air will be pulled in
from the top of the case and then it's
gonna be pushed out the front which is
fine there's plenty of event space for
that and also out the back with this
single 140 included with the case I have
a couple 120 s that I stole from a mesh
if I see that I'm going to use for the
two 40 mil rad so we're gonna put this
thing up front and then we're going to
throw in the graphics cards throw on the
pump and then we'll start bending some
tubes hopefully in this video we'll be
able to finish the thing and see what it
all looks like when it's said and done
so with that I hope you enjoyed the
build blog
all right and here you go finally finish
this thing actually took about three
days you guys didn't see that but these
bends were pretty technical not because
you know there were three or four bends
/ / 2 / run but just because everything
was kind of spaced out so awkwardly so
like none of the openings and the
radiators or the pump or the res lined
up perfectly so though had to be like
kind of turned slightly forward or
backward and that always poses problems
when it comes to bending the tube so
that's why it took me a while it's why I
really didn't show the process because I
probably had to dump about 2 or 3
strands of ptg to get these things
perfect from a horizontal and vertical
standpoint so with that I hope you've
enjoyed the build I think we're gonna
call this one and drama to version 2
because this looks a lot like in drama 2
version 1 but this is by far my most
powerful PC I've ever built and I 979
ATX e in there and two gtx 1080s in the
only way we could have made this more
powerful is if we hadn't bumped these
graphics cards to 1080 T eyes I did move
one of the desks from the office in here
we'll talk about that in a separate
video I think we have a few other things
we're going to do to the film room which
right now is a disaster and glad you
can't see much of it and then we should
have our setups ready to go so we can
start pushing out content on a regular
basis if you like it's better be sure to
give a thumbs up I appreciate it thumbs
down with the push just please subscribe
but if you have an ardent stay tuned for
more content like this
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us
