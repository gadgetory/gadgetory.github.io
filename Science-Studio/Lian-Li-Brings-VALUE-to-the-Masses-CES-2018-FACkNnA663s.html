the Leonie sweet Caesars Palace Las
Vegas for CES 2018 they've got a few
things that I definitely want to touch
on a lot of really great value products
Lee and Lee has always been a premium
case manufacturer but they're making
these things affordable for all of you
at least from a value perspective we're
gonna start first with a revision
actually two revisions of the PCO 11
case I built in that case right here my
first custom loop ever did you just Pan
the camera though Eddie all right take
to you right here my first custom loop
and the custom itself didn't go too well
but I love building in a case was plenty
of room so the renditions were
coordinated by first lien Lee and also
durbar who I want to introduce he's
gonna talk about the stuff that they've
changed in these cases and also the new
price that would be very attractive to
most of you so come on in here I want to
first introduce you to to YouTube
welcome to the science studio audience
and now you've got a few things
let me just a few you've actually done
quite a few things to this case to make
it a bit more unique and also make it
much more affordable for the masses Yeah
right alright so for those who are not
familiar with myself
I'm the bower also YouTube were also
working for case king mainly as a
product engineer and at caseking we use
this case quite often well the original
11 so we teamed up with Jameson and
Leanne Lee to modify this case a little
bit to make it more suitable for
everyone and well highlight some of the
features that were there before but make
it even better so basically the things
that changed are the usability so as you
can see on the right side the three fans
are moved a little bit to the back so
there is more room now so if you mount a
360 radiator on top you can still mount
a 360 on the back they're not blocking
blocking each other then you depending
on how you mount the VGA so in this case
it's mounted vertically but if you mount
it horizontally you can still mount
another 360 on the bottom so it's plenty
of space for that then we have a
tool-less mount for the tempered glass
as you can see there are no screws here
so if you take off the top part you can
slide off the side panel and the front
panel
so it's completely tool-less it's very
easy to mount that way another thing
that's very cool is the motherboard tray
is actually angled to the sides you can
basically get the cables out from the
side moving to the front so depending
what kind of motherboard you're using
you're not blocking the cable management
so if we take off the top part we can
easily remove sight
front and this side so as you can see
it's extremely clean you can see
radiator in here and the radiator has
direct intake from the side panel so
it's very good ventilation on here we
have the drive bay and if you remove
this drive bay you can even mount an
additional PSU if you want to for I
don't know if you need very big amount
of power and with this you can basically
unscrew those flip it down and you can
hide all the cables behind it so for
cable management it exists it's
extremely easy it looks clean very clean
even though the cables actually are not
done very nice behind it so another main
change is that 11 originally was full
aluminum and this is now changed to
aluminum and steel combination still
also covers tempered glass of course and
that makes it very affordable also it's
a little bit tinier a little bit smaller
so the use of space is very efficient or
you can see in the front is a custom
reservoir just built for this system
it's not going to be retail but looks
very nice and from my point of view one
of the most important things is that the
MSRP is 129 US dollar which is extremely
nice for what you get so now we're
standing next to the O 11 air it's
basically the same body as the Oh 11
dynamic but it's mainly made for air
cooling as you can guess by the name and
you can see there a ton of fans in here
and the airflow is extremely good so you
have a free air intake from the front
which is different to the dynamic
because the dynamic has a glass front
panel but in here you have a perfect
airflow you have air intake from the
bottom from the front top depending on
how you mount your fans one thing that
also changed from the original
11 is that on the bottom you now have a
free air intake you can also handle the
case very easily and that's gonna be a
little bit cheaper than the oil 11
dynamic price is not 100
and confirmed yet but it's gonna be also
very good price
moving on to fans this is a new version
of the well known Borah fan from Leon
Lee it's basically a light version a
little bit cheaper actually very good
price for what you get as well so main
features are you have a very nice and
black plastic frame covered by aluminum
frames cover that are on top so you can
see it's a CNC milled aluminum cover
that covers the Frank the fan frame and
as you can see it's RGB obviously but
it's just a normal
RGB header you connect to your main
board or whatever RGB controller you
have and the estimated price on this is
13 point 99 u.s. dollar and for three
you actually only paid 39 u.s. dollar so
it's a very good price for what you get
moving on to the Borah plus 120 so it's
a more premium version of the Borah
that's already on the market
as you can see mainly what changed is
the sticker also in the middle it's
perfectly centered because personally
that what annoys me the most is if you
have if you have a fan in spinning and
the stickers not sticky sitting in the
middle of it doesn't give it a premium
look also the main change to the let's
say the light version of the bar is that
you have this RGB frame as well so the
the full frame is also powered with RGB
LEDs and you can connect this one to a
controller will also be available and
you will have full control over software
so here we have a prototype AIO from
Leon Lee and the main difference from
all the well-known air also there is the
fact that the pump is not sitting inside
the block so the block is pumpless the
pump is actually sitting inside the
radiator radiator on top which is very
interesting because you can use the
space much more efficiently so we have a
bigger space for the pump pump is much
stronger than in any other arrow it's
also very smart solution so you have
those fins inside the radiator and the
other ones are for intake and the pump
in the middle is then pumping the water
through the pipes on the side here so as
you can see just a normal a all with RGB
in front covered by aluminum from the
side but as I said before it's still a
prototype
not sure when
this will hit the market but very nice
to see if you've been familiar with this
industry for a long time you will surely
remember the name LAN LAN LAN Cole was
budget cases from Leonie before so we
revived a LAN cool with this generation
I'm not sure yet when this case will be
available but I just want to present it
to you and tell you a little bit more
about the features so basically you have
a steel body you also have a glass on
the side and the main aspect is that we
only improved airflow so they listened
to all the feedback from customers that
were complaining to during like
2016-2017 about not sufficient airflow
and on this case we have a mesh on top
fully mesh so air intake can be really
good from the top and also from the
front we have the cover with aluminium
on the sides and in the middle we have a
full air intake that goes through and if
I just switch off the RGB fans you can
see that there is an RGB strip in the
front which which is also illuminating
everything that's inside and actually it
gives it a very very nice look even if
you would look from the side you can use
it like this without RGB fans and just
because of the stripe it looks really
nice alright so I want to thank de
Brouwer definitely for taking over my
job they did an excellent job
I was actually behind the camera there
for a second so this that we ended with
is the fusion elite and one cool thing
that I want to point out will be in this
video is that the guys from Lee and Lee
really want your feedback especially on
this thing this is still in the
development phase so nothing is
finalized yet and you're seeing some
b-roll now of the case of its features
we can't give you you know all the shots
but from what you can see they want to
hear from you they want to hear what you
want to see added what you think already
looks good what should be taken away and
I think that's really awesome they're
literally telling me like right now to
ask you guys for that feedback so leave
that feedback in the comments below I'm
sure they will appreciate it I will
appreciate it we appreciate them for
sending us out to Las Vegas for CES 2018
I hope you've enjoyed the coverage
thanks to all of them and thank you guys
