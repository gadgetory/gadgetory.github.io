camera for a first-person perspective if
you will about cable management for a PC
this is something that I do regard as a
very important step in the PC building
process but something that I will admit
I did not originally regard as a very
important step when I first started
building pcs it was just about you know
making the front look good not the back
no one sees the back right but it's it's
more than just an aesthetic thing and
even if you don't have a tempered glass
front and back panel and even then you
might have it pressed against a wall so
no one see it anyway
it's just peace of mind it's it's a
testament to how experienced you are at
PC building even if it's your first PC
ever it's still important to cable
managed properly it just makes the
entire building experience move by much
more fluidly and in in the back of your
mind you know that you built a really
awesome PC that that looks good on both
sides not just on one side so if you
ever take it apart or show anybody what
you've done show them how to build a PC
you don't want to pull the back panel
off and just have a rat's and that's
kind of fall out of the case so we're
going to talk about my personal take on
cable management what I do when I build
a PC nowadays and what I think will be
best for a case like this this is the
s340 elite from NZXT it's it's already
predisposed to be an excellent cable
management case I'll show you that here
shortly if you have a really crappy case
it's just not meant for cable management
at all I'll discuss that I don't
recommend buying a case like that for a
mid Tower or full-size Tower but that's
the tour will start before I start the
actual video I wanted to introduce a
game plan these are the steps that I go
through when I personally build pcs and
regard cable management as a top
priority what you want to do is install
everything except for your power supply
first it sounds weird it's probably
unworthy docks but it makes sense in the
long run if you think about how we want
to manage our cable so we want our
smaller cables underneath a larger
cables that way we can keep these
smaller ones in check they're not being
you know pulled and stretched and stuff
into places they shouldn't be creating
rat's nest things like that we want to
manage the smaller cables first because
they are more difficult to manage and
then overlap the large ones which are
typically found in the power supply okay
so this is the back of the s3 for you
leet you can see we have our front IO
cables already kind of managed through
the included cable clips and then
we have some other cables for the hue
Plus which is installed we have two 140
millimeter hue plus fans AER fans they
column and then one 120 in the back I
did connect those already these don't
connect to the motherboard so it's not
going to hurt have those already plugged
in but we will be cable managing all of
this so it's just kind of all hanging
here now but hopefully by the end of
this video we'll have an excellent case
that we can put the back panel on very
simply without any hassle without any
force extra force we don't know how
difficult it is to put on a back panel
in a case it doesn't have excellent
cable management your front i/o
connectors power switch power LED and
hard drive LED whatever else you have
there
all of that you want to get out of the
way first these cables are just a pain
to try to route around larger PSU cables
that's why I suggest running these in
first all right now we have HD audio the
front i/o connectors the USB 2.0 port
for the hue plus as well as the USB 2.0
header for the front panel all installed
on the bottom that's good stuff now
we're going to pull those cables back to
the back of the case we've all that
slack there and we know how much cable
we have to work with ok the last two
things we want to install are the two
largest cables that don't require a
power supply that is the SATA cable
running from our solid-state drive and
the USB 3.0 kit remember the largest
cables go last because we can use these
to kind of press down on the smaller
cables and keep those in check ok at
this point I suggest using a few tie
straps the thinner the better I don't
believe that the little cable clips
included with the case are going to be
enough we're going to use some of these
little indentions here and that's what
the tie straps are for so go ahead and
grab about six or seven of those and
we're going to start routing these
cables as best we can and make it look
as pretty as possible
you
so this is what I have so far I took out
the cable management clips here and here
they just I didn't like the channels in
there and these cables were too thick
for that so I use tie straps kind of
theme this whole video the more tie
straps you use the better you might not
agree with this particular I don't know
root cable root if you will and you may
have just chosen to go down this way or
something like that but as long as you
have your cables managed properly you
have a lot of space for your power
supply once you do
insert that and you can kind of work
around all these smaller cables easily
then you've done a great job with your
cable management one other thing I do
want to mention you want to make sure
that your cables aren't bunched up too
much if they are then you won't be able
to slide your back panel on so do keep
that in mind you don't want to throw a
bunch these into a larger rat's nest and
still tie them up you want to keep these
spread out enough to where you can slide
your back panel on with ease
now in this case you there really isn't
much we can do about cable storage these
are just going to have to be tucked away
somewhere that's where a basement does
come in handy if you don't have a
basement I recommend trying to cram as
much of it behind the power supply that
way you can't see it from the front of
the case and then if you have something
like a hard drive tray
maybe stowing cables underneath your
hard drive you don't have a hard drive
then you have even more space to work
with but that's all we can do at this
point because we do have so many extra
cables and just cables that we're using
in general even with a semi modular
power supply we're just gonna have a lot
of excess so that's where tucking is
going to be your friend tucking the
cables away in the places that you can't
see them from the front of the case
that's pretty much the goal at this
point we made everything else look
pretty but you know there's nothing else
we can really do about these power
cables at this point okay let's go ahead
plug these cables in and then take care
of the slack
and here we have it this is the finished
product if I power the PC on right now
it should boot up no problem Asuma
didn't forget to plug in anything this
is the product of having both a semi
modular / modular power supply and a
case that I will admit is excellent when
it comes to cable management so I was
kind of really predisposed to do a
decent job given that I was actually
trying but if you follow the steps in
this video
you know route your cables the best you
can use many tie straps as you need even
some you know a little sandwich tab tie
straps would even on a column but as
long as you have those your disposal and
you're not you know packed with cables
that you don't need from not much of the
power supply you should be good to go I
mean this is really going to be up to
you how much effort you put into your
cable management will determine how
great it looks back here I would be
completely fine with having a tempered
glass right panel given that the cable
management looks this way so let me know
in the comments what you think about my
job given what I was you know what I had
my disposal if you have any questions
concerns be sure to leave those in the
comments as well this video a thumbs up
you thought it was cool or helpful give
it a dislike if whatever you hate life
or you thought I did a terrible job and
subscribe for more content like this I
will be showcasing this build exactly in
the next video this is Salazar studio
thanks for learning with us
