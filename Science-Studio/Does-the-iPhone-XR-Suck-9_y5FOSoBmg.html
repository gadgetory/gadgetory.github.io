already seen a review or two online
regarding this phone but what I intend
to do is compress this review into five
major categories styling operating
system camera a battery life and price
these are the things I value most in my
phone it's not this phone but in the
phone that I use on a daily basis and
depending on who you are on the iPhone
10 are may or may not be a great choice
this video is brought to you by
expressvpn in a nutshell Virtual Private
Networks mask your IP and encrypt your
data a big reason I use it is because it
allows me to retain my security on the
go so if say I connect to a sketchy
public Wi-Fi hotspot I can be sure my
data is safe expressvpn offers both
android and app store applications by
the way for mobile private networking
just a single click can tell you
anywhere in the world if for example you
want to tunnel through Switzerland for
whatever reason you can click
Switzerland and there we go I'm now in
Switzerland so as you can see easy to
set up easy to use in today's day and
age and also vital in today's day and
age and that's why you can visit
expressvpn slash science or click the
link below for three months free with a
one year subscription so starting first
with styling I think the iPhone 10 R is
decent looking phone the glass back
offered in a variety of colors is a nice
touch it reminds me of the old-school
iMac g3 s from the late 90s this one
here is Lisa's phone and she's a huge
fan of yellow which was honestly a
compelling reason before go the more
expensive 10 s counterpart and I wasn't
interested in spending $1000 on a phone
so there's that as well I'm not the
biggest fan of these bezels they're
definitely thicker than my pixel threes
but I suppose this is the price we had
to pay for a nearly full screen display
or is it would you believe me if I told
you this phone screen to body ratio with
less than 80% a lot of it has to do with
these bezels as well as the obvious
notch the 10s is bezels by the way are
slightly smaller so there's a trade-off
there but again you're paying more for
the phone overall so these bezels aren't
too big a deal the phone is a bit large
in the hand at first it's a large iPhone
I'm used to
smaller iPhones the iPhone 7 the iPhone
se was a very small compact one I like
that size a lot more if we had like a
full screen to body iPhone se that would
be a really cool phone I'd probably end
up buying that one even if it cost a
thousand bucks because it's small and
compact and I like the portability of
such a phone but this one's pretty big
so it takes some getting used to and
it's not necessarily that the frame is
large like most phones are about this
size it's the fact that the screen is so
big with respect to the phone so you
know one-handed use if I want to go way
up here to the top right I literally
have to slide my entire hand up here to
be able to drag down the control center
right so one-handed use is definitely
difficult to do with this phone you're
almost gonna always have to use that
second hand to control things especially
on the top of the display the knotch by
the way it takes a bit of getting used
to if you're not already used to it this
one though is much shallower than the
pixel 3 XLS which means it's much more
tolerable in the long run even when
streaming like a full screen video it's
not that bad by the way the stereo
speaker setup is pretty solid the
earpiece is a bit trebly as usual but it
definitely beats using a single speaker
the primary microphone is down here as
well as a lightning port a SIM card
trays on the bottom right and the power
of volume buttons are on opposing side
so the ringer toggle is here as well
which I am actually glad to see I'm glad
that it's still on iPhones the back of
the phone feels very premium like I said
glass back aluminium trim an undertone
of yellow in this case definitely makes
it stand out my personal favorite is the
red model but yellow looks great as well
and of course it's Lisa's favorite color
so she had to go with that now apart
from the camera setup the only other
marks on this side of the iPhone are the
Apple logo and the word iPhone as for
the operating system this is typical iOS
with a bit of added flare on account of
the missing home button so the swipe
feature is an interesting one to take on
but much like the sheer size of this
thing you get used to it
apps closed and a snap the UI is
straightforward and the settings window
is the same as it's always been just
with a few extras the a12 Bionic chip in
here is lightning fast the first 7
nanometer tech to actually officially
hit the market and it's apples
own in-house design so that's pretty
incredible and it definitely shows some
the operating system is super snappy
anything I do is just instant and that's
what I expect in an $800 phone but again
with the missing home button there are a
few gestures you have to get used to for
instance the control center accessed by
swiping down from the top right apps are
closed by just swiping up from the
bottom it's a different approach but
like I said a few times already
you could get used to it and I think
Apple did a great job with sculpting the
OS around the lack of a physical home
button I've honestly never had an issue
with iOS in the past save the lack of an
accessible root filesystem it's one of
the reasons I often pivot between iOS
and Android while I love the simplicity
and ease of use with iPhones there's
something intuitive and versatile about
Android that always pulls me back and
when you're on something is pure in
stock as a pixel 3 you don't really miss
iOS as much but that's a different story
for a different video what I will say
about the 10r though is that if you're
already familiar with iOS from previous
devices there's only a shallow learning
curve with the added gestures up next is
the camera and this is a hot topic for
these phones especially one of the
biggest drawbacks from the 10s and the
10s max is a lack of a secondary
telephoto lens but its absence is only
sometimes noticed when taking a normal
photo for instance you'll notice that
the angle is fairly wide which means
you'll need to move a bit closer if you
want macro detail like this here the 10r
is limited in its portrait mode
capabilities to humans by the way which
means that you won't get that sweet
bokeh background blur unless a face
literal human face is detected otherwise
you'll see this message right here and
that sucks but everywhere else the
camera it shines the rear camera anyway
I did notice a degree of over saturation
and especially dim scenes but this is
easily correctable in post contrast is
pretty decent general low-light
performance is satisfactory thanks to a
wide f-18 aperture and the quad tone
flash is actually usable not something I
can say about its competitors video
shoots at up to 4k 60 and it looks
pretty sweet as does optical image
stabilization and 1080p even at a slo-mo
240 FPS here are some video clips for
comparison alright and I'm testing the
front-facing video along with its
Audio the secondary mic section in the
back of the camera so I'm interested to
see if this sounds any different than
filming at there on the rear so we'll
see alright and now I'm filming with the
rear camera for k60 and really sure to
see how this sounds just because no
iPhones tennis I'm pretty good on video
stereo mics so it should sound pretty
clear through and through my pixel
threes microphone is terrible that audio
sounds very bad so anything to step up
from that and iPhones traditionally have
had pretty good microphones so hoping
that this recording sounds somewhat
decent quality definitely drops at 240
FPS but that in and of itself is a
pretty incredible feat for such a small
and compact sensor stereo recording also
keeps audio in check so you know I
wouldn't be too disappointed with just
like the built-in microphones if I was
on the go trying to get some quick shots
the front-facing camera it's a 7
megapixel F 2.2 sensor good for selfies
and the like but it's just it's
noticeably not as good as the pixel
threes or the pics of 3 X cells now
those cameras do have two cameras up
front to kind of give it an edge but I
think Google's processing right its
onboard processing is significantly
better than Apple's especially when you
want to blur things out of the
background when using portrait mode I
think it just over compensates and it
really just blurs the edges too much to
where you don't see defined differences
between the foreground and the
background even the rear camera on the
10r does this and it's it's
disappointing now Google has its own
issues with its portrait mode if you
will
it's very aggressive and that means that
you'll find very sharp distinct edges
between the foreground and background
but that could also mean that the
background kind of shows up in the
foreground being it's not properly
blurred so I think both phones take
different approaches here I just don't
like the fact that the iPhone
overcompensates and blurs too much in
the foreground because that's what you
don't want blurred right you want the
foreground isolated and fully you know
sharp so when it is blurred it's
disappointing it means that you kind of
to revert back to the stock image which
at that point is no longer a portrait
photo by the way the camera app is
fairly simplified but I don't
necessarily see this as a bad thing if
Apple intends to target customers
content with ease-of-use they did an
excellent job here you can swap between
camera modes near the shutter button and
the opposite end sports controls for
flash timers tones and what I'm calling
a digital aperture a function that
essentially controls the degree of
background blur in portrait mode all in
all I'd give this camera a solid 8 out
of 10 in 2019 my limited experience with
a-10s is part of the reason why I'm not
willing to go any higher with this score
the other reason is the fact that my
daily is a pixel 3 which I'd still only
give a 9 out of 10 on the camera side
it's just too good to ignore it does
have its issues but it's still a better
single sensor a rear camera than the
iPhone 10 ours up next is battery life
and this is where the 10 are truly
shines now there are trade-offs again
we'll address those but it is a really
good phone with respect to battery with
compared my pixel 3 especially it isn't
miles better with moderate use this is
easily a two day charge while my pixel 3
barely manages one a lot of this has to
do with the lowest screen resolution a
fair bit of resentment toward this phone
initially had to do with it's subpar
pixel density at just 326 PPI basically
old-school retina which is a step back
for the iPhone but up close I mean does
it really matter you can see individual
pixels sure but I personally think it's
been blown way out of proportion
use as a vice by those who are already
predisposed to hate Apple products and
that's fine look you're entitled to hate
any product for any reason I just think
that the screen resolution is a cheap
job because it still looks great in
person especially for an IPS display
contrast is pretty incredible colors are
vibrant and accurate the screen itself
gets very bright and you don't have to
worry about things like burnin which
played earlier Google pixel models kind
of a cheap shot back to Google but still
worth mentioning but back to battery
life continuous use will result in they
were between like 9 and 12 hours of life
that's pretty good that's comparable to
giants like the the note 9 and the 10s
max and it's thanks primarily to the
screen resolution which is why I brought
it up you can watch an entire season of
your favorite TV show on Netflix albeit
not info
1080p but still and probably still have
battery life left over that's how great
this thing is and it'll make the
transition to something smaller that
much more difficult it's again the one
thing I hate about the pixel 3 but again
this comes at a cost of not having a
1080p screen but I'd be more than happy
to pay this price even for a film with a
6.1 inch display the PPI is not that bad
really and this brings us to our last
category price unlock you'll pay in here
between 750 bucks for this thing and
$899 no slouch for an entry-level iPhone
I know this isn't what Apple calls it
but it is what it comes across as when
you think about the things that are cut
back in this model especially compared
to the thousand-dollar the $1,300
versions the second rear camera is gone
on the 10r the screen resolution is cut
down by 25% Super AMOLED is swapped for
an arguably inferior IPS display bezels
are thicker HDR is absent heck even the
waterproof rating is slightly lower for
the 10r but this is the price we pay or
rather the price we save for a more
affordable Apple smartphone if you want
the 10s you'll need to pay at least 250
bucks more for a model with equivalent
storage that's insane
but it's the trend all across the board
not just with Apple I mean the pixel 3
cost 800 bucks and that's why I'm a bit
confused as to how to conclude this
video I don't really know I mean I know
the pixel threes are close competitor
the 10 RS right especially with respect
to price so I don't really know where to
go from here how about answering the
fundamental question do I recommend it
actually yeah more so than the 10s and
10's max simply from a price perspective
paying over $1300 for a fully loaded
smartphone it's absolutely ludicrous in
my opinion that that's my opinion and
look even the basic iPhone 10s will set
you back $1,000 so these are my parting
words if you must buy an iPhone make it
the iPhone 10 R and choose the color
that fits you best and feel good about
it in the end of the day despite its
drawbacks and compromises I still find
it to be an impressive and highly usable
phone I'm still not giving up my pixel 3
though so what do you guys think
which would you choose and let me know
what your sporting currently down below
