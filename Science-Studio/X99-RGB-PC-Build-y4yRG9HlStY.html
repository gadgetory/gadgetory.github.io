trend came from it kind of spread up out
of nowhere this year it seems and now
everything is RGB but I do remember that
I jumped on the bandwagon about six
months ago with my first semi white
build and I realized that white surfaces
in a case tend to reflect any color LED
that's being shown on that surface so
that's why I still stick with white pcs
today I just have that flexibility if I
want a purple build I can just change
the LED to purple and there you go but
we've taken it a step further with this
build right here it seems like every
other tech tubers tackle the origin
theme to PC video I know I'm late to the
party but I think this one gives
everyone else our run for their money
check out how good this thing looks I'd
like to give a huge shout out first off
to NZXT for sending over their s340
elite in the white variant for obvious
reasons as well as their hue + + AE our
RGB fans I made sure that I install the
hue + correctly and use the correct PSU
cable you can double check me on that
other components in this build include
the Intel i7 5820k 6 core 12 thread
haswell-e CPU I didn't go with a 1600 K
because I got this haswell-e chip for a
steal but if you find the CPUs for about
the same price obviously the 6800 case a
way to go 14 and the architecture
slightly more power efficient things
like that but these chips are pretty
much on par with each other in terms of
performance you won't notice a huge
difference by choosing one over the
other the motherboard I'm using is an
asrock X 29 tied sheets my ex and anti
motherboard of choice and I do recommend
it absolutely for anyone looking to
build an excellent ion system on the
cheap it's not a $500 motherboard or
anything like that anything crazy you
can pick this board up for about 200 to
220 dollars and I have it linked in this
video's description along with all the
other parts in this PC I went with a
single gtx 1070 from EVGA in this parts
list in order to keep the overall price
down although I do recommend for this
build here either a gtx 1080 or 210 70's
like I have behind me there's 110
through the second cord and after the
fact that all these b-roll clips you're
seeing here all of those are going to
include a single 1070 just because if
you want to build what is in the video
description then you only have a single
1070 or if you swap that for a 1080 a
single one of those the CPU cooler
choice I'll admit is a bit unorthodox
own with a crier rake see one
also in the video description it's a
beefy cooler it's a heck of a cooler for
an ITX form-factor although it won't fit
into something like a fractal no - OH -
not enough height clearance there but it
looks especially cool in a tempered
glass case like this even for an ATX
build I do recommend it I just like the
fan facing me I just don't know I do now
surprisingly given the way that the c1
is oriented in this build I actually had
enough room to install g.skill trident z
ddr4 underneath it these have custom
heat sinks on them you know this isn't
like bare PCB here so there's enough
clearance under there for decent looking
ram not stuff that's like super crazy I
don't think any you know Corsair Don
plats or anything like that would fit
underneath but I didn't even install
anything on that side believe it or not
I chose some really cool-looking DIMMs
check these out now you're probably
wondering where the RAM is usually it's
installed at this point because I have
something special to show you
hall-of-fame ddr4 capable of 3600
megahertz
it's - 8 gig dims here is this from
Galax just check out the packaging the
packaging itself is a telltale sign that
these DIMMs are very important and very
beautiful check that out just look how
good a single stick of this hall-of-fame
Ram is oh Galax has been asking me for a
while now about the inclusion of these
DIMMs into a build I told him I would be
doing one shortly but I wanted to wait
for just the right moment it's you can't
find an X 99 board that has a white PCB
this is about as close as it gets
the MSI X and a nine titanium is a
silver build so it would kind of it just
looked a little weird having white Ram
and silver PCB but I think that the a
drug X in NIH is a good fit for it we do
have white accents on the cooler and of
course our s 340 elite now is all white
on the inside and if you didn't know
there are LEDs in the RAM as well and
these are of course white so ya know
just I think it'll all work together
very well
these these DIMMs are some of the most
beautiful I have ever seen
and you can find these in the video
description if you're interested they're
hard to get ahold of but trust me it's
worth the wait
so yeah and I installed them into slots
a1 and b1 a left hand side of the
motherboard nothing's on the right hand
side because you couldn't see anything
over there anyway
so it works out fine that way everything
functions properly I'm running them
right now at 3600 megahertz
without a hitch on the azrog x99 Tai Chi
one thing I am a little bit let down
about I don't know why but neither of
the LEDs in either module are working
they're supposed to be a breathing
effect going on but they're they're not
doing that and I'm pretty sure they're
supposed to do that out of the box I
look for software couldn't find any
software to configure them so I don't
know what to tell you there that's a bit
of a letdown
perhaps just uh you know just got some
faulty dims for the power supply be
quiet sent over another 1000 watt dark
power Pro 11 yeah it's super overkill
but this power supply is super quiet and
that is a huge important thing for me I
just I can't stand hearing the power
supply just spooling up the way that
some of them do this power supply does
not do that at all it is virtually
silent and I absolutely love it for
storage I went with a good ol SSD plus
hard disk drive combo never hurts a 500
gigabyte Samsung 850 Evo along with a
one terabyte Western Digital black it's
the one I keep recycling from build to
build only because all of my sting games
are on there which is great for
benchmarking lastly I would like to
mention the custom sleeve cables sent
over by cable mod actually sent over a
few months ago and I use them in a
previous PC so I just recycled them
threw them into here they're all white
so it works we have a pin ups atop 24
pin and then to eight pin VGA s these
are extensions so they work with any
power supply including the dark power
Pro 11 from be quiet I don't think I
forgot anything if you'd like to see
maybe a benchmark of a single 1072 5820k
versus a 6700 K in the same graphics
card just for comparisons sake let me
know if you'd like to see something like
that in the comments below give this one
a thumbs up if you thought the build was
cool if that build suck to give it a
dislike be sure to click Subscribe but
if you haven't already stay tuned for an
official review finally of the deep
cooled genome this is a revised version
that also comes with the PCIe riser card
which means that you can already a
graphics card this this way you get my
point this is salad a studio thanks for
learning with this
