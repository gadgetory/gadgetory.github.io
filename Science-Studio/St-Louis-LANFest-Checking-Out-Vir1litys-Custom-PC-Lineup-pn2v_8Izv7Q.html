Louis
this is where a Tony lives were actually
at so you say most universities the
right yep and we're at here at the land
only flew me out to participate in the
intel lan fest this is my person
whenever i really enjoy the environment
its pre awesome experience to encourage
all of you to attend one if you can Tony
here bill species that's his thing and
he builds a lot of really awesome custom
pcs custom loot build that you'll see
here shortly yeah I mean it was really
it started out just to fill the need
that kind of like turned into a hobby
I've always been the type of person that
I like it I like a challenge and I've
always kind of pursued different
creative outlets kind of always been
sort of an artist so it really just has
blossomed into a avenue for me to
express my creativity and I'm really
drawn to the more challenging type bills
so like one of the things I'll do is
I'll see a particular case that you know
I think of myself that case isn't miss
chillin meant for a lark old system but
if you're willing to take on the
challenge
it could potentially do something that
is really neat you know if you're honest
with people you have to tell them
watercooling really doesn't make any
sense from a cost and performance
standpoint but if you've reached that
level as an enthusiast where you're
getting into custom water cooling you
should take that in my opinion you might
as well take the opportunity to like
take it to the next level and then we
create the best looking build that you
can so that's that's kind of the way I
approach it feel like I've inspired some
people to maybe take it to the next
level or you know just just fuel their
passion for the hobby it's like that's
kind of rewarding for me so yeah so
we're about to see what 5pcs that you've
built personally yeah different gear
yeah flora bummer for rumor custom
water-cooled the fifth one is just just
there's no custom water cooling in it
but it's a neat steam so yeah kind of
we're showing off let's go check it out
awesome right okay so nice oh I you know
I just repeated this because we're
speaking a over them over the intercom
quite a bit but Tony's built several
visa pcs actually all them that you see
here you have pretty much all right yeah
oman these are all his released his
creations and kind of want you to just
walk us through like each one and you
know if the process you went through and
the dollars
okay the system here I built for my son
it's an online course air air 240 one of
the neat things about this case or i
guess i should say it's the main reason
I wanted to build in it is it gives you
the ability to do an inverted system
which is something I've been kind of
wanting to do I ran into some headaches
along the way as I've run into
previously with course their faces but i
wanted my main goal with this bill was I
wanted all the components since this is
kind of a dual-chamber separated design
I wanted to be able to have all the
components like terminate into the
midpoint so I had to build that from
scratch again it's just acrylic it's
acrylics actually awesome it's real
versatile it's it's fairly easy to work
with if you have the right tools you can
literally order vinyl on amazon and have
it in one or two days and then you can
just use it and it's done can I think
you got you have two vinyl right there
on the back yeah those it like the
carbon fiber this is actually the vinyl
that they use you know for car wraps
yeah so it's cool I mean it's got a neat
depth to it so yes is this disc you did
yourself you cut this whole piece out
and the piece in the back yeah and then
if you notice you and this piece here
the way an ox is around down there
because that's actually a little like
gorilla back there yeah they're just
stupid tiny fans that nobody here report
good 80 millimeters weather yeah yeah
then I get to use like further for the
holes for my pastors obviously there was
a lot of planning that went into where
those would be and I could probably pull
the panel off the back here and show you
you know I just use soft soothing back
here this is a mess right now just
ignore how bad this is because I've had
a couple of issues with this and it's
not oh yeah the fans aren't working the
fans yeah I haven't seen more about this
in a future video but anyway yeah and
then i just used soft tubing back here
it wasn't really any reason to mess with
rigid to be a look smart alright so this
bill here this is actually one that I
did
for someone who came to me and asked me
if I could do a custom loop in his
computer he builds us for him to be able
to play BR so again if the piece of
acrylic skin with like a brushed
aluminum style vinyls so that's why you
don't really see the side of the fans of
the radiator is whole sort of hidden
behind there and that I didn't do that
because I wanted to hide the stands and
radiator I did it because I wanted to be
able to hide the LED strip and that's
just kind of the way it works out so but
the thing that that I was able to
achieve what this build is that I was
able to run the tubing in such a way
that the person who owns this pc now is
able to access all of the components
upgrade the system on their own without
necessarily having to worry about
disconnecting any of the water cooling
yeah it's all pretty install
conveniently routed out of the way low
yeah and it works out well too because
since there's a window on the top of the
case having all the tubing or avocado
really really needs you went on the
water cooling was in common that's a
pretty simple loop and this is the 570 x
of course Derek man correct yeah the
7700 k so I think we have a real mild
overclock like 4.7 like so you know I
wasn't going to push it on a system it's
not mine they're not going to be able to
troubleshoot issues from Matt overclock
so keep it simple so this one here is
this is actually my personal rig my rig
is always kind of a work in progress
right now it's rocking a 1080 the goal
is to get my hands on a 1080p I that's
why this isn't water cool but I've got
all the tubing routed across the top to
wear you know you just see the tubing
terminate I mean if you look up in there
you can see it yeah
that little gap between you know where
you might have your radiator support
normally and then the top of the case
there was plenty of room up there to run
the tubing I need a dremel in out a
pretty big section of the basement for
one the palm pres combo wasn't going to
fit through the stock opening there so i
had to enlarge it anyway it's your
pretty typical high-end system 32 gigs
of course they're dominator platinum
especially as e170 board we've got the
950 pro that's only a 256 and then I've
got to 500 gig 850 evos and raid 0
that's that are on the back side of the
case this is the evolved tempered glass
this is yeah the into of all TV so this
one here this is the this is the this is
the one that's getting the most
attention I think for obvious reasons
the coolant ironically this is probably
the system I spent the most time on not
because I was being meticulously because
there was just a difficult build getting
this much water cooling to fit in this
small of the case especially when you
consider you know factoring in a place
is res it is a DDT palm so it's smaller
but we're still difficult to figure out
how to get all of this town in here I
ended up having to build a custom like
plate to be able to mount the ddc to
which if anyone's like thinking about
doing a similar build in this case I do
have a four-part billboard on lighting
on where you get a little bit more in
detail on you know kind of what I went
through to make the squirt because I did
you know I had a plan and I had to
change it and then I had to change that
plan like you start doing this yeah you
start doing the stuff and realized it
doesn't work at least for me personally
if it's not challenging I kind of leads
into so
definitely it looks like a challenge
right there yeah I mean it paid off
though you know now one thing this is
acrylic tubing is the build in the fan
sex case was also occur like the
previous fewer petg so what's your
preference acrylic repeat ECG I feel
like like a close one yeah it's a couple
different reasons I don't know why
people are so hell-bent on using peds II
and saying it's easier I think Skrillex
just as easy to work with and I feel
like I can get nicer been from a curling
but I like the rigidity of it it allows
you to get much nicer angles on your
Bend petg especially along longer runs
tends to want to flex along that system
so it's hard to get like perfectly
straight and maybe maybe I'm nitpicking
but I do notice those things and they'll
kind of bother me so Bonilla nope this
is these are actually older components
this is a z77 motherboard sexually an
Ivy Bridge build with the GTX 980 but
it's still a pretty pretty strong build
for 1080p gaming so and for those
wondering i'm not sure if you said is
already what the coolant that we use its
mayhem zarorat they handle or yeah let's
Aurora
yeah it's pretty amazing now a lot of
people you know everyone on the
internets an expert so when you when you
show off the system with aurora coolant
you know a hundred people have to tell
you how you use the wrong coolant
because this is only meant for show
bills well here we are at a show so yeah
for all the people that were giving me
 for using aurora coolant which i
caught a lot of flack for it on reddit a
couple other places but yeah it looks
amazing it shows off really well it
bantams does not recommend running it in
the system long-term honestly worst case
scenario run it in your system you get
the particulate built up you clean it
out you know yeah maybe that's the pain
but it is what it is so and then the
last system here the what we we jokingly
called the t-mobile bills this one
obviously doesn't have a custom loop
however very clean bills obviously a
well-executed theme and color scheme
didn't do anything drastic for this
other than just you know with the custom
cabling and just spending some time and
effort this kind of like showcases what
is achievable or even just the average
system builder if there yeah you're
willing to put in the time I'll tell you
this i posted the picture of this on
reddit and i got a ton of for
mounting the cpu block upside down
people acted like that was the end all
of but if you rotated this around you
you jack up the tubing routing in a much
cleaner tubing routing to me makes the
build look cleaner than a right-side up
text on your damn cpu block so obviously
that's a preference but you know this
tubing is actually pretty long on this
aio so i'm more of a fan of a cleaner
run the reason that I ran such a long
route for
the graphics card cable is you have all
this awkward empty space down here so
just having something there helps to
balance out you know the build gives you
some point of interest that's happening
down an upgrade
ok
