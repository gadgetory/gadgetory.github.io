actually used to sell pcs quite a bit on
Craigslist actually when the channel was
very young when we weren't getting
products sent for free for review by
companies like gigabyte a soos what have
you case manufacturers like fractal
design here I had to buy all the stuff
out of pocket because they didn't know
who I was I didn't expect them to we had
like you know a hundred subs so when I
would build a PC like this for say four
or five hundred bucks I listed on
Craigslist for a modest price maybe like
five hundred and fifty bucks maybe like
a 10% markup usually no more than that
it was a really expensive build and then
I would essentially flip the PC and then
move on to another build and I'd take
that five hundred fifty bucks
build something with totally different
components get to test those on the
channel sell that try something new
again with the small profit I made on
that one as well so I knew my way around
the Craigslist ad when it comes to pcs
that's why I feel confident with the
Craig's in the series that we post on
the channel but I want to show you in
this video how to properly sell a PC if
you're having trouble selling the one
that you have currently listed maybe
these pointers will help
it's extremely important that you one
take good quality pictures I'm not
asking you to go out and buy a three
thousand dollar DSLR or mirrorless
camera that would make no sense just use
your camera phone most modern phones
have decent cameras packed into the most
of them have a AI or some software
that's gonna make the picture look a
little more crispy than normal because
the sensors are pretty small and that's
really all you need to do also take a
lot of pictures the more the merrier
tells the buyer that you again have
nothing to hide and that you're
forthcoming about the PC itself and that
you're confident that it's a good system
that said a pet peeve of mine is when
people post ads for systems like these
and don't actually include pictures of
the product they're trying to sell
instead they'll show screenshots from
Amazon or Newegg of the parts included
in the build that tells the fire one of
two things either one your bill looks
like trash and you're trying to hide it
or two you haven't actually built the
system yet you're trying to fulfill the
orders as they come in and that's not an
effective way to advertise a PC build
now you're probably thinking yourself
great how can you say photos the most
important aspect of a Craigslist ad
wouldn't it be the title or the price
those two have a lot of weight that's
true but humans are visual creatures and
I can tell you when I see a title and a
price tag I want to look the photos for
validation you don't have that
validation the title and the price are
meaningless now when it comes to the
title keep things short and sweet I see
so many people trying to over complicate
this you know put some huge paragraph in
the title section of their ad you know
something along the lines of extreme
gaming PC or best gaming PC you'll ever
see or best value gaming PC on
Craigslist don't do stuff like that we
don't care we just want to know what it
is you're trying to advertise the title
can be as short and sweet hook something
like 1080p gaming rig boom that's all
they need to know you're not trying to
hide anything you're not trying to pass
it off as something that it isn't
just keep it short and sweet I recommend
putting the gaming resolution the
recommended gaming resolution for your
system in the title because a lot of
people want to know upfront what kind of
performance they should expect for the
price that you were asking so in this
case I'm gonna do just that I'm gonna
call this a 1080p gaming rig next up
we've got to think about price what
should we ask for the said system in
this case this whole thing cost me out
of pocket about 500 bucks and I don't
expect people are going to pay $1,000
for a core i5 34
you rig it's not gonna happen even if I
put something like a gtx 1070 or 1080 in
here people understand for the most part
that older platforms are limiting in the
sense that you can't really upgrade much
without completely switching platforms
in this case that requires buying ddr4 a
new motherboard and a new cpu and most
people who are willing to buy gaming pcs
on Craigslist are probably not gonna
want to take up that mantle any time
soon so I'm realistic when I approach
the pricing aspect and I try not to ask
any more than about 10% above what it
cost me to build I know 10% it's kind of
a vague markup but honestly it just
doesn't make sense to charge more than
that I it wouldn't make sense for me to
charge even six hundred and fifty bucks
for this again because the platform is
so old despite having a relatively
modern card in here and a modern case
it's certainly presentable to an extent
but it's not worth seven hundred bucks I
wouldn't pay that I wouldn't expect
anyone else to pay that so for the sake
of a quick sale and a quick profit I
would say 550 bucks for this system is a
fair offer whether or not you want to
haggle after the fact is a separate
issue I'll leave that up to you but I
just again don't recommend you take a
loss if you have to break even that's
fine just to move through inventory but
I don't recommend you know taking 400
bucks for this it just wouldn't make
sense you'd be losing money for what the
sake of building pcs I don't enjoy doing
it that much next up let's talk
description what should you include
first off a list of every single part I
don't fault anybody as I try not to for
listing individual components in their
builds in their ads that's expected I
want you to do that I don't want any
surprises when I show up to buy your PC
what I don't want you to do is list
retail prices for those parts maybe what
you paid for it I don't care to know
that all right I care about the price
now I care about the inherent value I
see and use components and I don't want
you to try to justify your price by
listing retail prices spoiler when you
buy something it's not new anymore the
next chunk of information I suggest you
include in your description is what kind
of stuff you do on a daily basis with
your PC it just helps you be a little
more friendly and human to the potential
buyer and it could give them an idea of
the
to use cases for that system if let's
say you play World of Warcraft a ton on
this PC and you can do it in higher Mac
settings in 1080p that's something I
would list you're not misleading
somebody or telling them exactly what
you do don't lie about it because when
they buy it and find out they can't do
that
you're gonna have issues of your own to
deal with what I suggest doing it's just
listing out your uses maybe you've video
edit on it doesn't mean it has to be the
best video editing machine out there but
just tell them what you do with it
because it again
makes you seem a little more personable
and it can help a potential sale the
last thing that I recommend you include
in your ads description are your
expectations for the sale what I mean by
that is where you expect to meet whether
or not you are considering negotiations
or trades and your contact information
so how they can reach out to you
regarding the ad in question now the
first bit is extremely important because
it concerns the sellers credibility if
the buyer gives you cash for a PC that
he or she didn't test takes it back to
his or her house powers everything up or
attempts to and finds out that the
computer doesn't work you're gonna be in
a lot of trouble potentially legally you
could be taking a small claims court
over a misleading ad right you've sold
me a PC that you said works but actually
doesn't alright and you'll probably lose
I'm not a lawyer but I would say
probably lose that small claims case you
don't want to have to deal with any of
that mess trust me
so instead find a way to let that person
test the PC or the component so that you
have peace of mind so that you know that
buyer can't come back and say you misled
them I know it's difficult to do with
something as large as a PC whether that
means inviting a stranger into your home
which I don't really recommend
especially of live in sketchy part of
the neighborhood or just going to
Starbucks setting up an entire desktop
right there in the shop I don't know if
you could get away with that depends on
the employee probably depends on the
store but that's another option there
are a few places in public that you
could probably get away with this but
it's worth a shot right and it's
something that I don't think you should
take lightly and try your best to let
the buyer test the system I cannot
stress that enough just for your sake
for the sake of court fees and all that
other crap you might have to deal with
in the future let them test the PC so
that's it this is the ad and I intend to
sell local here on Craigslist
anyone who watches this video to go and
find it the number I have included
there's a burner number so don't try to
contact that I'm just gonna end up
changing it later on it's gonna be a big
waste of time for you and me frankly but
yeah I will follow up and probably a
tweet I don't know if I make a full-on
video on it but I'll let you know when I
did of selling this system for I don't
think I'm gonna haggle too much because
550 is pretty much that's almost what I
paid for it I paid about 500 bucks or
everything in there so yeah I could've
done better with the price of the used
components in there but I still think
it's a decent system for 550 bucks
things though based in this video can
run pretty much anything we throw at it
at at least 60 fps and medium to high
settings in 1080p and even 1440p
depending on the bottleneck situation so
if you guys liked this video appreciate
the tips let me know but get some that
thumbs up I appreciate it thumbs down
for the opposite of where you hate
everything about life you can do that as

who's feeling especially fancy you know
I'll catch you in the next one this is

thanks for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
