having a good weekend by the way the
title of this video I'm sure is
confusing some of you and probably many
of you if you didn't watch last week's
live stream you're definitely in the
dark here so what on earth is ghetto
studio well I invite you first to check
out this video this will tell you
everything you need to know about what I
expect from entrance in this giveaway
which will be recurring we'll try to do
it once or twice a month if we can do it
every week that would be great my
parents love when I get home
it doesn't seem structurally sound yeah
well neither does this whole room so
what is that that's just like the corner
I don't really walk around some luggage
sponsored by tascam I don't even know
that I'm a bunch of sub boxes because
like everybody in high school you had to
have subwoofers and I got rid of the
subs but not the box this is a computer
that Greg built me here's my skeleton
that holds all of my headsets all except
the tascam so the idea of these
giveaways will be for entrants to film
with their phone or with the camera
doesn't really matter how you film it I
want like a minute to a minute and a
half video of you showing me your setup
now your setup has to be sketchy it's
got to be ghetto that's the whole point
of the playlist it's why it exists again
if you didn't watch Nick Elevens kind of
studio video and I invite you to watch
that first because that's what I'm
looking for something that's really
weird using just a bunch of random stuff
to keep your PC and your monitor propped
up maybe you're using like a super cheap
keyboard and a really old-school monitor
and your build just looks disgusting
like that's the whole point that's what
we want to showcase in these videos
because the winner of each of these
giveaways that we do hopefully every
week or so will win 100 u.s. dollars and
the benefit of being able to pay you in
cash or in money is that I can pay
anybody on the planet who has a valid
PayPal account or if PayPal doesn't work
in your country we'll use something
that's also secure but you get the point
I don't have to ship you an item that's
gonna cost more than the item does to
send it to you so this way I can just
direct transfer your money and it's just
quick and painless especially on my end
now my goal is that the winner of each
of these giveaways will take that money
and reinvest it into his or her setup
maybe improve something that we pointed
out didn't look really great when we
showcased your video
the previous week or two so this is kind
of just a work in progress here I don't
expect this will be the exact way we do
things every week is gonna have to feel
it out because I have never done this
before and I think it's an original idea
I hope so
feel like I'm listening to something
through a bar oh I also have the Hank
Aaron signature shout out to Hank Aaron
shout out to my mom she doesn't know I
have this I stole her from her you stole
her dinner stand next to her bed you put
your food on him and watching TV in the
living room oh you just blew dust
everywhere so what are the rules how do
you enter we have to be 18 years old at
first that's my way of covering myself
legally if you're not 18 or older then
you can have your parent or guardian
enter on your behalf that's our way of
getting around a little caveat it's not
the case for every country but it's just
kind of like an overall requirement it
just keeps us covered on our end in case
anything does come up in the future
so again if you're under the age of 18
just make sure that I know who is
entering on your behalf and then we will
go on from there now how to enter we're
gonna have an email to dedicated email
for this playlist in the video
description will be there every ghetto
studio video that we upload and that is
where you're going to submit me your
link your link is going to be a link to
a YouTube video that you uploaded on
your dedicated channel showing your rig
for a minute or a minute and a half now
it doesn't have to be just your Rick I
should clarify and I want your whole
setup this is called get off studio so
it also includes I don't know whatever
else you have in your room if you have
your bed in your room I did for a while
then show that I want to see the entire
space I want to see the desk reusing the
monitors the peripherals you get the
point now I'm gonna do my best to figure
out who is staging their entry if you
are going out of your way to make
something look really disgusting I'm
probably gonna be able to call it out if
you just have dirty laundry let's say
everywhere that's not gonna get you an
entry okay because that's first off easy
to do okay so good try their second off
it has really nothing to do with getif
studio because none of that stuff
actually pertains to the studio
workspace that's just added stuff from
the environment I want to see the actual
setup again really sketchy you can see
in the video that it pointed to earlier
again McLovin uses really weird things
to get it going he uses a TV tray Jesus
for for a keyboard and mouse that he it
looks like he literally stole those from
a high school right I mean that's the
kind of stuff we want to see something
that's just
ghetto that's unorthodox and out there
really cringe-worthy that will get you
an entry into the giveaway every week if
you don't get entered one week we can
still recycle previous entries so
something else I want you to remember do
not make multiple you know entries for
the same video I don't need to see your
link three or four weeks in a row I have
your link stored if we don't have any
other entries or if your entries really
good but it didn't quite you know make
it to the top forward one week it might
make the top for another week so if you
don't get you know entered the week that
you submit the link don't worry you
might show up in a later episode and
this keyboard looks like you stole it
from our high school yeah look at the
mouse again keep your videos short sweet
to the point I don't mind you talking
that's perfectly fine I actually
encourage you to talk through what
you're showing me I want to know what's
in your rig I want to know the kinds of
you know things you have set up the
monitors all that stuff maybe talk about
how much you spent on all of it maybe
you got it for free I don't know but
just something that would help your case
right if you think it something's gonna
help your case
for being a winner in ghetto studio then
then go ahead by all means tell me
what's up but don't lie obviously and
don't stage things again that is
something that's going to be a huge
turnoff I will completely blacklist your
email and I just won't deal with it
anymore especially if I know you're
trying to con me into saying that you
have a ghetto studio when in fact you
don't you just try to make me think you
did now there were a few more rules that
we were kind of negotiating through in
the live stream last week which is why I
encourage you to watch our live streams
every week if you want because it's more
of a personal touch to the channel I can
talk with you one-on-one or whatever
hundred on one but I can see all of your
messages in chat and if you haven't
joined the discord by the way that's
public discord you can do it by clicking
on the discord link below that's another
way to contact me directly so if you
have you know rules that you think need
to be included in future revisions of
gadot studio that's perfectly fine again
this is gonna be a fluid experiment I
don't expect it to be set in stone
forever they are going to need to be
improvements at some point I am almost
certain of it but this is just to get us
started I have all the rules
specifically linked below not linked but
you know they're detailed below in the
video description and if you have
anything that you think is you know if
you see anything it's missing something
that
needs to be added last minute do that in
the comment section below let me know we
think about the entire idea of ghetto
studio and what you're looking forward
to seeing because I think it would be
really fun way for us to kind of laugh
at each other I mean look I used a
dresser for the longest time as like a
desk from my setup like I've been in the
same situation a lot of you have been so
I totally can relate Pepsi is chewing
she's chewing a graphics card box that's
just great
the goal here really is just to have fun
now I'm gonna roast you a little bit
that's gonna be the other funny side of
this I'm not going to keep quiet when we
showcase these videos I'm also going to
provide some constructive feedback again
this is just another way to liven up the
video is just a little bit
speaking of which we're going to have
four entries purgative studio upload so
for every video for every episode we're
gonna have four entries four unique
videos from which to choose so if you
you know make your way into one of those
videos if you get selected you have a
25% chance of being picked the winner of
that episode now here is how the winner
is selected by the way all these rules
are again in the video description check
that out if this isn't as concise I'm
going to need help from all of you we're
going to use Twitter as our poll base to
get your feedback we're going to have
entry 1 2 3 4 we're going to have the
link to the video in question and you're
going to pick which of the four you
think is the most ghetto and the the
entry that has the most votes we usually
receive a few thousand votes at least
with every Twitter poll that we run and
these are gonna run for 5 or 6 days long
I imagine the the one with the most
votes is going to be deemed the most
ghetto and that person that entry will
be considered the winner for that
episode I know there are other ways to
run polls and surveys on the Internet
but I want to use Twitter because it's a
way for us to drive traffic to the
science studio why t-handle if you
haven't already followed us I encourage
you to do that but you do not need to
follow us to vote each week or whenever
we do these go to a studio videos it's
just a way for us to again drive traffic
to the handle it helps us it's an
important tool an important social media
tool for the channel so you want to help
us it's totally fine you don't have to
we just want you to use Twitter because
it's just it's very simple for us to set
up first off and again it just it helps
us in the long run because that social
media presence
is so important so if you have any other
concerns or questions I invite you to
leave those in the comment section below
you can again join us in discord we have
a science yes city it's our tag team
discord server with Brian over at Tec es
city so you gotta talk to Brian as well
but I invite you to leave any of your
concerns and/or critiques in the comment
section again or on that discord you can
also tweet at me but it's it's just and
if I get a lot of questions on Twitter
I'm not gonna reply to all of them it's
easier for me to reply in bulk on this
cord especially if a lot of you have the
same question
and YouTube as well I always check
comments within the first hour or so so
if your question is not in the comments
section or on discord or ever then I
invite you to ask it and it might help
us shape our rules for future revisions
of the ghetto studio playlist so again
this is something that we're just gonna
try out and we'll kind of mold it as we
go this might not be very popular that's
fine we'll move on to some other topic
but I think this will be a fun way for
us to get more involved in a personal
level have a laugh at each other and
actually get some constructive feedback
as well regarding how you might want to
optimally set up your gear if you happen
to win you know awesome
that's kind of the winner is actually
more like a loser because you have the
worst setup but at least you win a
hundred bucks so that'll be fun I don't
know how long I can keep up a hundred
bucks a week if that's what it comes to
that's that's a lot of money so we'll
see hopefully we get some sponsors to
back us up if this becomes you know a
hit on the channel but again this is an
experiment so let me know what you think
in the comments below on discord on
Twitter elsewhere
thanks for watching guys I will catch
you again in our next official science
studio and video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
