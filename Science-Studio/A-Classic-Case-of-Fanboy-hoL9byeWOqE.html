ignore objectivity and most of the time
they also ignore irrational discussions
because if you automatically assume that
that person is a fanboy then they'll
just resort to calling you a fanboy for
the opposite team and that gets no one
anywhere at that point if you're in that
debate with that person you should just
stop you're never gonna get anywhere
you're never gonna influence a fanboy
that he or she is a fanboy and that's
like rule number one of being a fanboy
you can't be influenced of your inherent
subjectivity for no reason whatsoever
then you're probably one look it's okay
to prefer one over the other even if you
want to extend this to graphics cards or
motherboard manufacturers if I purchase
primarily corsair products does that
make me a corsair fanboy okay maybe from
the outside it might appear that way but
maybe i just appreciate the reliability
of course their products or just how
aesthetically pleasing some of their
products are so being a loyal fan does
not necessarily mean that you're a
fanboy and people use fanboy in a
derogatory sense as more or less being
that blind and inherently subjective
person who doesn't rely on facts so to
bring this one home if i today and
prepare to tell somebody that I prefer
Intel CPUs over AMD CPUs then I better
also be prepared to back up my statement
with supporting arguments maybe I prefer
to just play video games that's all I do
on my gaming PC and because of that and
I understand inherently that Intel has
higher frame rates due to the fact that
Intel's been refreshing the same
architecture for four or five years and
so developers have had longer times to
optimize games with Intel CPUs versus
Rison which is a relatively immature
platform by comparison and also the fact
that Intel CDs overclocked a bit higher
there is my argument right that could be
one of the few arguments that I throw at
that person who might otherwise assume
that I'm a fanboy that's called
supporting your argument with just you
know facts and that's what fanboys don't
tend to do they tend to ignore facts and
just spew crap that has no basis in
science no basis on any of the channels
that I look up to and that I feed off of
right when we're exchanging info and
we're talking about how we're
benchmarking products we don't want to
do anything wrong we don't want to give
you guys the wrong impression or lead
you to the wrong conclusions and often
what fanboys will do is
come to a conclusion that is not based
on anything we've ever presented on our
channels and that's exactly what
happened with a viewer of mine in my
last video which you can check out right
here in a nutshell I discuss how to
upgrade your be 350 bios in order to
make it compatible with Zen plus for the
2600 up through the 2700 X I
demonstrated the process but I also
pointed out that you can't just buy a be
350 board and expect you know the Zen
plus CPUs to work out of the box the
motherboard was obviously manufactured
before Zen plus was unless it was built
yesterday and because of that you're
going to need a Rison one so it's summit
ridge CPU first in order to boot into
the BIOS and then flash it within flash
queue flash and whatever usually on a
thumb drive now I understand that AMD
has kits for these things you can I'm
not sure if they're still doing it but
you can usually contact AMD they'll send
you a little dummy CPU but it let you
boot into your BIOS and that's all you
really need and then you can swap that
out for your Zen plus CPU and you're
good to go I'm not sure if they're still
doing that a few people pointed that on
Twitter so let me know in the comments
if that's still the case and I will pin
your comment but that's honestly beside
the point see this viewer took what I
said in the video out of context because
I pointed out that you would need a rise
in one CPU in order to upgrade your BIOS
on a be 350 motherboard he defaulted to
the typical AMD is trash statement by
saying quote AMD is so garbage okay well
that's basically trash you literally
need to buy two CPUs just to set the
correct motherboard BIOS so the one that
you actually want to play on works trash
fodder Intel will always be on top of
the CPU market and in video will always
be on top of the GPU market yeah we're
gonna ignore the second half of his
comment we might say that for the end
and just address it briefly but the
first half is what I really want to
focus on that's the meat of this video
because his statement assumes that AMD
is the one responsible for all of these
BIOS updates that should be by default
on all motherboards
when they launched because motherboards
are supposed to account for technology
that's not you know manufactured yet
right so see here or two down the line
these motherboards just posts they're
supposed to support the CPUs out of the
box basically and so that's that's his
first error in judgment also
this is not something that's isolated to
just AMD ignoring the fact that you
could contact AMD more than likely and
get that dud CPU de to upgrade your BIOS
the Intel's done the same thing I mean
if we'd look just back in the the last
generation here with kb lake in order to
run a cable a cpu on a z170 board for
example you had to flash the z170 bios
and this would be a problem for those
who did not already have a sky like cpu
on hand right you would have to get a
sky like CPU or just buy one off of
Amazon a really cheap seller on for
example flash it and then you could put
that cabling CPU in that socket but not
only that see the the viewer first off
is blaming the wrong person and they
really there's no one really to blame
for this I mean the fact that you can
even use a newer gen CPU on an old
motherboard should be a blessing you
should be thankful for that regardless
of how many hoops you have to jump
through the fact that we can run Zen
plus on a be 350 board should be a good
thing you know it's not something you
expect to work perfectly right out of
the box because Zen plus wasn't invented
when the be 350 motherboard was
manufactured but the viewer first off
leads his comment with the statement AMD
is so garbage and that's how you can
usually tell when you have a fanboy in
your midst and when they make these just
egregious claims and then proceed to try
to back up their argument with stuff
that's not even true that's when you
know they're either severely misinformed
or they're just so blind to their fanboy
ISM that they're not willing to argue
with you know logic I sincerely hope mr.
green is trolling all of us but I have a
pretty strong feeling he is not and
that's unfortunate but the fact of the
matter is many trolls out there exist
you guys know this not just in the
youtube comment sections but also on on
forums like reddit right it's plugged
with fanboys but you can also find
logical and and well supported arguments
on both sides not just in the CPU market
but also on the graphics card market
between Nvidia and AMD kind of tying
into what mr. green talked about in the
second half of his comment he says
NVIDIA will always be on top in the
market for graphics cards and Intel will
always be on top for you know CPUs blah
blah blah and kind of inherently correct
in the sense that these companies do
have substantial market share and their
respective categories but I know that's
not what he meant when he said that he
was more or less saying that they're
gonna be the dominant better company
always and when you go about making you
know a statement like that
how it's always gonna be this way
they're just arguing more or less from
their emotional states than they are
from their logical ones so it's really
all I wanted to talk about in this video
I'm still benchmarking myself that's why
I kind of just threw this in there as an
in-between all you guys to be aware that
people out there are going to argue with
you for the just for the sake of arguing
and I do that a lot to be honest but
often times because I want to challenge
their know their positions like why do
you feel the way you do explain it back
it up you know don't insult me just just
just throw facts at me and I can at
least appreciate facts if they're
verified and I try to do the same in my
videos I try to show you guys exactly
what I'm doing so that you can go and
replicate these scenarios on your own to
either verify or deny what I'm showing
you in my graphs and and that's
something that I expect you all to do if
you have the free time is to at least
you know cross-reference my benchmarks
or other people's benchmarks on YouTube
and elsewhere with other benchmarks so
that you can get a you know just an
encompassing idea of what general trend
is for this particular launch so my R 5
vs. IFI video will be coming very soon
you guys steer clear the fanboys they're
out there right now and they are there
stalking their prey they're waiting for
that one guy to fall for the troll and
then they'll unleash the fanboy ISM take
care you guys I will see you in the next
one if you like this one give a thumbs
up I appreciate it thumbs down for the
opposite subscribe button you guys know
what to do Delon defecation icon all
that good stuff
this is science studio thanks for
