studio and we are back at it with
another product review meet the newest
addition to our camera lineup the nikon
d50 100 now it isn't the newest or best
camera on the market but if you can snag
it for a great price you will not be
disappointed here's our pick for the
best budget DSLR camera at three hundred
dollars so the first thing we did was
mounted on our handy tripod make our way
down to the local pond and test this
thing out we had an 1855 millimeter lens
as well as a 70 to 300 millimeter lens
so that we could focus on both things
far away and close up so enough of the
chitchat let's get straight to shooting
and filming so I found the squirrel
lurking nearby popped on the large lens
vibration reduction and autofocus were
both active
next I pointed the DSLR directly at the
Sun to have a good look at its aperture
and shutter speed abilities the d50 one
shutter speed can vary from one four
thousandth of a second all the way up to
thirty seconds shorter exposures are
typically used in bright situations
where as long exposures can be used in
especially dark ones the ISO can also be
adjusted anywhere from 100 to 6400 now
in terms of special added features
selective color is my personal favorite
allowing the user to control which
colors show up in a given photo in this
case I selected only greens to show up
but in the next photo taking it exactly
the same place
I selected only blues to show up pretty
cool huh
next I compared the image quality of a
16 megapixel Nikon point-and-shoot to
the Nikon DSLR both are rated at 16
megapixels the results are very similar
the D 5100 boasts a 23 point 6 by 15.6
millimeter CMOS sensor mirrored which is
only averaged by today's standards but
it's lighting capabilities are on par a
cool feature of the D 5000 series is
that each screen is hinged and movable
the screen can actually swing out a full
180 degrees and also swivel in the
vertical up to 270 degrees this specific
orientation makes it a great camera for
the occasional youtuber or a dynamic
photographer who is always finding his
or her way into small cramped spaces I
can put a lot of thought into their
standard macro lens apart from the
excellent image quality zoom transitions
are smooth and crisp which comes in
handy when filming I do wish however
that Nikon had added more rigidity to
the manual focus ring which is made of
plastic and is quite sensitive to the
touch this is likely though due in part
to the integrated autofocus motor within
the lens which would require a less
sturdy focus ring
I recommend all novice users keeping the
autofocus on if your lens supports it
you can see in this clip here how the
continuous autofocus software was able
to keep up with my rather novice
movements back and forth and occasional
zooms the camera does only have eleven
point autofocus detection but I never
noticed it struggle to keep up with
where I was going
battery life is around 600 shots or
about an hour to an hour and a half of
video recording but after an entire day
of doing all of this I'll tell you right
now the battery readout in the camera
stayed at a full three bars I was quite
impressed
the d50 100 boats a turn dial crammed
full of presets as well as for manual
modes the dial just below it can be used
to select specific features within each
of these presets a disadvantage to
having a swivel screen is limited button
placement but it's a compromise I was
willing to make the simple operating
system made the fully manual modes quick
and easy to navigate through but more on
that in a sec
the camera supports an external
microphone output a micro GPS add-on
since the camera doesn't have a native
tracking system built in a type see mini
HDMI out something you really don't see
much of and a mini USB adapter on the
opposite side of the Dee 5100 is support
for a single full-size as the D card
okay so on a quick note back to nikon's
operating system I have to mention here
that I truly love how they integrate a
similar design and order in each of
their DSLRs hopping between this and the
d7000 was a piece of cake if you're a
novice many of these controls won't be
difficult to handle in fact in several
instances and shooting modes the OS will
literally explain to you what a specific
function does so if you have no idea
what you're doing
this can certainly come in handy but now
even if you're a professional
photographer the d 5100 offers enough
robust versatility to rival a few of the
newer DSLRs currently on the market it
isn't the most phenomenal video recorder
either and versatility is limited but
you can shoot in full 1080p at 30fps as
well as 720p at 30fps if desired
so in conclusion the Nikon d50 100 might
be a bit outdated in terms of the
features it offers like the eleven point
autofocus detection versus the d7000
thirty-six point and like the sixteen
point two megapixel sensor first the D
3200 24 megapixel there are definitely
trade-offs when it comes to purchasing
any older model product but the point I
want to make here is this for the price
of around three hundred dollars you
cannot go wrong sure you won't have the
newest and best but the D 5100 offers a
great incentive package the sensor is
still stellar the battery life is great
color depth and picture quality are on
point and the swivel screen is it's
pretty much just like the icing on the
cake it's a great camera for anyone
looking to shoot the night sky a son or
daughter soccer game or a wedding our
advice don't spend thousands of dollars
on new ultra fancy cameras unless you
absolutely have to do what we did and
pick up a secondhand DSLR that's been
taken care of and only a few years old
you won't regret the money you'll save
or the performance you'll reap
this is science studio thanks for
