planned I was actually in the middle of
benchmarking the cryo rig h7 quad gloomy
cooler the one that I have in the system
right now along with the i9 70 900 X
which is known to be a very power hungry
CPU and also a CP that runs extremely
hot but in the middle of my testing
using I 264 I realized that my CPU which
should have been idling was not actually
doing that I had no other substantial
background process running confirmed via
the task manager except for one thing
that popped up that I was unaware of at
the time that was the Windows module
installer this little guy right here is
a nuisance not only because it does
utilize some of your CPUs available
horsepower but it does so without
actually telling you and to be honest I
wasn't too surprised by this Microsoft
has been known to push updates without
user consent in the middle of gaming in
the middle of editing and rendering
Microsoft might say hey we're gonna
restart right now because we're
Microsoft but that of course is a
separate issue when I have an issue with
here is the amount of CPU horsepower
that the module installer was using
while I was supposed to be at idle the I
970 900 X is an absolute but he myth of
a 10 core 20 thread CPU it's a beast
okay I reviewed it in this video right
here I do have problems with though one
of those does have hot it runs and
that's why I was testing with this
technically underpowered air cooler from
crack I'm just kind of seeing what the
worst-case scenario would be for the
cooler that video is coming very soon
what I had a problem with though this is
a ten core twenty thread CPU okay
overclocked to four gigahertz and still
when the module installer was running
when the computer should have been
idling CPU utilization topped out at
around 20 percent that's pretty
substantial had this been a four core
eight thread I seven which makes much
more sense for the general consumer
utilization would have been much higher
that's a very bad thing especially when
it's unplanned so I wanted to see just
how much of an impact the module
installer had I ran GTA 5 I didn't know
how long I can do this because I wasn't
sure how long the module install I would
be running it's completely random as far
as I'm aware and then also ran Geekbench
and Cinebench while confirming that the
module installer was still running via
the task manager the game I tested was
GTA 5 which offers a pretty fair balance
between CPU and GPU horsepower with the
module installer running average frame
rate was 120 fps
1% lowers were 74 and 0.1% lows were 63
FPS by contrast when the module
installer was not running average FPS
was a hundred and thirty one one percent
lows at eighty and point one percent
lows at seventy two FPS from a
comparison standpoint average framerate
really didn't change this should be
expected though it's a ten core CPU this
is one of the best case scenarios for
gaming in general even though a seventy
seven hundred K is a better gaming CPU
the extra cores on the ten core CPU
allow us to do other things in the
background without hindering much of
that performance at all but where we
really started to see the installer
effect gaming performance was in the 1%
and 0.1% lows a 6 FPS Delta for 1% lows
I would say is fairly substantial I
don't think it's insignificant this is
almost a 10% reduction in the 1% lowest
frame rates we observed 0.1% low is
depict an even worse case scenario 63
FPS when the module installer was
running vs. 72 when it was not we're
looking at nearly a 15% 0.1% fps low
reduction just from having that
installer running and that can be
substantial especially at these lower
frame rates around 60 and 70 FPS we can
also look at this graphically these are
the frame times across the entire
benchmark for both scenarios the blue
dots here represent the install frame
times and in this case you want lower
frame tonnes right it's the inverse of
FPS so the lower the frame time the
higher the equivalent FPS it's exactly
the inverse of frames per second by the
way so a lower consistency here is what
we're looking for and the free color the
orange color here is slightly lower and
you can see there our frame times are
not as spiky there aren't as many spikes
upward with the orange color as there
are with the install blue color with a
graph like that the flat of the line and
the lower the line is to 0 the better
off you are this is pretty substantial
if you're a professional gamer
especially I recommend checking the task
manager beforehand to make sure that
that module installer is not running
when it came to CPU synthetics I tested
Cinebench and Geekbench just to see what
our actual drop was in potential CPU
power with that task running in the
background
starting with Cinebench r15 single core
score dropped to 118 from 171 multi-core
from 20 to 17 to 1984 and with Geekbench
for a single core score dropped by
nearly 900 points in over 4,000 points
the multi-core side so we're seeing our
multi core performance dropping
significantly whereas single core really
isn't being impacted LMO it really
depends on what cores being stressed and
which cores are being utilized heavily
by the Installer module so like I said
this video was not planned it was not
scripted I just came across this when I
was benchmarking the CPU actually
putting it through a few stress tests I
wanted to see just how much heat the h7
quad Lumi can dump from something as hot
as the I 970 900 X this is something
that I don't think is too significant
for most people most the time you won't
notice the framerate drop and only a few
times you'll have those dips that'll be
pretty significant that you might say
something else seems to be going on in
the background here only reason I
noticed this is because I had CPU
Diagnostics open and running if you're
not someone who looks at stuff like that
a lot you probably won't even know
what's going on and that's kind of what
Microsoft wants they don't want you
knowing that they're doing all this
stuff to your PC in the background
otherwise people would just keep turning
it off and Microsoft would never be able
to update anything still pretty salty
about this one that I could imagine if I
had an i3 i5 or Rison 3 CPU this
utilization would be much higher and
that would impact quite a bit especially
if you're gaming you would notice my is
this seemed more laggy all of a sudden
if you notice that check your task
manager first and foremost make sure
that nothing is taking advantage of
maybe more than 5% or so of your CPUs
total utilization space unless you're
streaming we're doing something that you
know it's gonna take advantage of that
extra horsepower I understand this is
not a novel discovery it's not something
no one's ever heard of before obviously
Microsoft does this kind of stuff all
the time but look I didn't know this was
going on until I had i-264 up and
running and if you're gaming you sure as
heck I'm gonna know because you're gonna
be preoccupied with the game not that I
blame you if you like this video be sure
to give this one a thumbs up thumbs down
for the opposite be sure to click a
subscribe button if you haven't already
and stay tuned for more content like
this especially the h7 quad looming
review from crier rig with the NZXT
software kind of mixed into there this
is science to do thanks for learning
with this
