and go to a friend's house down clocking
Ram is as simple as hopping into your
bios disabling XMP profile is enabled
and manually setting Ram frequency under
the Advanced Settings tab the lowest we
can go is 800 megahertz simple as that
save settings are not a PC to reboot we
can verify via CPU Z or another program
that our Ram is in fact maxing out at
800 megahertz this is double data rate
we're dealing with
hence 400 you're seeing here the
benchmarks you're about to see will
contain a proper run of each scenario
stocks 2800 megahertz for these dims out
of the box displayed in white and under
clocked to 800 megahertz displayed in
orange the CPU I'll be using is an i7
6700 K overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz and
the graphics code I'll be using is an
EVGA gtx 1070 a CX 3.0 running at stock
let's start off first with a few cpu
synthetics along with an encoding
benchmark via Adobe Premiere Pro first
with the Cinebench we see a roughly 10%
performance decrease but this is just
the start don't worry folks it gets much
worse than this Geekbench 4 takes things
a step further this indeed is a more
comprehensive benchmark and we're
beginning to see the effects of slow
memory take hold but in the real world
how much can we expect memory frequency
to play a role well let these
disparities quite a large one our Adobe
Premiere Pro tests seemed ok at first
scrubbing detail rendering clipping even
forcing GPU accelerated effects
everything worked out well and without a
hitch the things became very real when I
began encoding exporting a 10-minute
1080p 60fps file in the YouTube h.264
preset with 800 megahertz memory
resulted in abysmal render times nearly
double what we should expect from a
healthy i7 PC I find it interesting
however that apart from serious
workloads and CPU stress tests everyday
use of the PC was rather fluid games
loaded normally I could surf the web and
open multiple tabs without issues it was
all bit peculiar when seen in the
context of what we seriously and
purposely effed up but then the gaming
benchmarks began and Wow was GTA 5 a
disappointment I ran these tests in
1080p in order to leverage the CPU just
a bit more it's also a very popular
gaming resolution without crippling the
system which was sporting an i7 6700 K
4.4 gigahertz remember in a single gtx
1070 we pulled 137 FPS on average 74 on
the minimum side but the 800 megahertz
ddr4 run cut these frame rates in half
actually more than half 57 on average in
a mere 28 FPS minimum something else I'd
like to show here frame times for GTA 5
we're looking for relatively flat
consistent frame draw times in this case
anywhere from 5 to 15 milliseconds but
we see variability in spiking all over
the place with the 800 megahertz run our
28 megahertz line is also much longer
because a significantly higher number of
frames rendered during the exact same
time period also something when I look
for in a graph like this now on to
battlefield 1 a very well optimized game
even handle the 1.2 gigahertz CPU with
ease but now with an average frame rate
of 51 and a minimum of 36 we found an
Achilles heel and I will say however
that in game performance consisted a
very minimal stuttering and a tight FPS
range always a sign of great
optimization it was that way without the
RAM bottleneck by the way witcher 3 is
our graphics intensive game of choice
and it shows here while the under
clocked ram did impact performance it
didn't do so to the degree I expected
our overall average dropped by 14 and
our minimum by 16 fps
still not bad for a GPU bound title but
let's end on a sour note how fitting
city skylines an intensely CPU dependent
game suffered massively under the memory
bottleneck we went from 73 to 26 FPS on
average and down to a terrifying 12
frames per second during its worst
segments notably when zoomed in I mean
look at this performance I wish you can
call it that really our graphics card is
on cruise control while our CPU is being
forced to slow down on behalf of very
slow memory transfer rates bear in mind
I did not touch cats latency and timings
how do I raise those we've been an even
larger heap of trouble imagine a large
and powerful v8 engine capable of say
500 brake horsepower but with a very
terrible fuel pump installed not enough
gas makes it to each cylinder
compression ratios dip and the lean
mixture doesn't live up to the 500
horsepower the engines rated for in a
similar fashion our CPUs clocks very
high 4.4 gigahertz which I believe most
anyone can attain with some even cooler
on a 6700 K by the way
so our CP has a lot of potential but
memories frequency reduced
the data transfer rate the CPU is
capable of a certain processing
potential but information isn't being
fed to the CPU quick enough this is why
typically only unlocked chipsets include
support for memory frequencies higher
than stop that's 21 33 megahertz in the
case of ddr4 any faster and Knox Q's
likely wouldn't keep up with short-term
information being fed from memory down
CPU pipelines and see you thought this
video would be completely pointless
there's always a chance to either learn
or review something nevertheless I do
hope you enjoyed this video or at least
had an ounce or two of your curiosity
satisfied if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up give it a
thumbs down if you look we top Zerby
hate everything but light be sure to
click Subscribe but we have it only stay
tuned for no I didn't really think I'd
get this far on the first first take I
suppose stay tuned for a proper I TX PC
build this time around I ordered an i-5
7600 cake hey Vee Lake processor I'll be
throwing that into the Franklin OH - OH
- once again but this time with a Z 270
motherboard from has rock also an ITX
motherboard and either an Rx 480 or gtx
1070 not sure which one I'm gonna go
with I might leave that question up to
you to be answered follow me on Twitter
to participate in that poll which I
expect will be open for several days
this is Salazar studio thanks for
learning with
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
