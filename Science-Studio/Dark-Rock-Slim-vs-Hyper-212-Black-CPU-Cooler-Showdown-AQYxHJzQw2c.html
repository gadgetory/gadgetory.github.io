exciting I have two coolers right here
in front of me to read the title be
quiet dark rock slim and cooler master
hyper 212 evo Black Edition for all
intents and purposes just a hyper 212
Evo although some have claimed slightly
better thermal performance here there's
really not there's not supposed to be
any difference so what we're going to do
is use this as kind of like our
benchmark this is a 30 or so dollar USD
cooler and that is an insane value
that's why the hyper 212 Evo is one of
the most popular air coolers around that
and it also is compatible with pretty
much any ATX or micro ATX build doesn't
interfere with your RAM much at all and
yeah again should follow suit there the
dark rock slim is a new entrant came out
just a few weeks ago and it follows a
very similar footprint so for copper
heat pipes each each come with a 120mm
fan of both pwm fans and this one has a
180 watt TDP rating this one doesn't
really have one on their website but we
can assume it's around a hundred and
sixty water so TDP and my testing that's
what it comes out to kind of around the
Kyrie h7 quad Lumi space so we're gonna
weigh all that in with this video and
I'm going to try to be as fair and
unbiased as possible especially given
the price disparity between the two
because I expect this to be a better
cooler for the price but maybe that's
not all you should consider if you
decide to spend more than this maybe the
the sound quality matters more to you
than just cooling in general although I
think in this price point you're
probably more concerned with cool so if
we're gonna weigh all that in this video
stay tuned
it's easy to look past certain things
but an activate Windows watermark yeah
not one of those things snag a verified
Oh am Windows 10 key from SCD key for a
little over ten bucks and enjoy a fully
activated OS without the annoying
compromises use offer code s studio for
an eighteen percent discount on your
order so the first thing I want to talk
about is ease of installation and this
is something that you're going to run
into no matter what I'm unless you have
someone else do this for you you're
going to have to deal with the
installation processes of either of
these coolers the hybrid 212 Evo uses an
older mounting process and older
mounting mechanism so it's not as
refined as a dark Rock slim took me
about two-and-a-half or three minutes to
install that cooler whereas a dark rock
slim it's about a minute and a half and
that is due in part because the dark
rock slim uses the same mounting
mechanism as the dark rock four and dark
Rock pro four which we reviewed in this
video right here so I had a slightly
unfair advantage there but it uses a
bracket basically like a brace over the
entire cold plate so you only need two
screws to secure the cooler to the
motherboard whereas with this cooler the
bracket requires four screws and you
actually have to secure the bracket to
the cold plate via screws upside down
underneath the cooler is kind of a weird
installation process I know I had run
into this before when I used to use the
hyper 212 Evo a lot but it's been a
while so I definitely needed a refresher
all in all the dark rock slim definitely
had the easier install process but I
mean I'm minute or two isn't really
going to make much of a difference and
it certainly doesn't make up for the 30
or so US dollar disparity between these
coolers remember that both of these
coolers do ship with a four pin PWM
120mm fan the silent wings three fan and
B quiets case is indefinitely
I think the better-looking fan it is
certainly quieter you'll see our sound
test here soon but the fact that the
hypertrophy evo Black Edition does
include a four pin fan is still a nice
addition especially in the $30 price
range a few physical aspects of the
coolers to point out both of them
utilize for copper heat pipes I believe
they are six millimeters in diameter
each I'm trying to see on the box here
it's
says that I'll look it up online if not
it just says for he pipes okay well that
doesn't help much yes that would be six
millimeters so I confirm that with
Coolermaster cooler and the dark rock
slim also has six millimeter copper heat
pipes and remember there are four for
both so pretty much apples to apples
here I mean this is not really it much
closer than this especially when you're
crossing over between companies I used I
264 engineer and stress the CPU as well
as the graphics card and system Ram so
the graphics card would in theory heat
up the CPU just a bit more because that
heat is gonna passively rise into the
CPU cooler you can find the remainder
the parts used in our testbench link
down below if you are interested in
building something similar there tied to
where amazon affiliate account so it
does give this a small kickback just
want to throw that out there one more
point of distinction is that i use
carbon up pads from thermal grizzly
because of the consistency right they're
easy to remove and reapply they're
reusable we've confirmed that in our
testing and it should keep our what
would be thermal paste application
extremely consistent between these runs
and i ran both of these temp tests for
each cooler twice to make sure that
there was no variance between them now
one of the good stuff these are CP
synthetic low temperatures measured in i
264 after a 20 minute burnin and you can
see that the hyper 212 evo a black
edition came in at about 86 degrees
celsius that's the max the peak
temperature experienced during that 20
degree run the average temperature was
77 point one and coincidentally the dark
rocks limb came in at the exact same 86
degrees even there was no variance there
and then seventy six point nine degrees
on average over the twenty minutes and
that's within the margin of error of
that seventy seven point one from the
212 Evo so from my testing at least
these coolers are nearly identical and
I'm kind of not surprised because they
look nearly identical and if we assume
that the fans are turning it around the
same rpm which we're using normal fan
curve so very slightly out of the box
but these fans are meant to run at
different rpm stock that would explain
the small variance if there was any but
in this case they're pretty much the
same another important aspect of a CP
cool is how loud it operates and this
can be measured in decibels perceives
down intensity remember reason the
logarithmic scale here
so the hyper 212 Evo at idle conditions
was 27 decibels 26.1 the dark rock slim
up to forty two point seven for the 212
under load and forty 1.2 for the door up
slim so the darker exilim was definitely
the quieter cooler I could perceive the
difference it wasn't substantial but it
is noticeable and this is gonna be you
know almost totally due to the fact that
the silencer efan is in the dark rock
slim this is a very premium fan now the
cooler master fan was good I was
actually surprised by how well it
handled noise but well you know when the
temperatures heat up and and the the fan
has to spill a bit more to accommodate
it did get noticeably louder and it was
a higher tone the silent wings three
fans have very low tones and they're a
little harder for most people to hear I
think so that also plays a role and
probably is why it seemed even louder
than what the decibel readings suggest
so there's that the coolers are exactly
the same the only key differences
between the two or that this one is
slightly more difficult to install and
this one is no I don't think saying
slightly quieter does it justice it is
noticeably quieter but is it $30 quieter
I really don't think so I have to be I
have to be honest with you I think if
this came down in price by about 10
bucks
it was around fifty dollars that would
be more competitive as of right now this
is competing in the 5060 dollar market
with like the h7 quad Lumi maybe
something a little bigger beefier than
that and so it's trying to punch above
its weight class but it especially with
its price but it just it's not there I
mean you'd have to really get this fan
to ramp up at which point the whole
purpose of this cooler using a style at
wingstreet fan to be quiet
it's kind of out the window so my take
on it is that the hyper 212 Evo is by
far the better value this is gonna be
more premium they both weigh about the
same at least that's what it feels like
in the hand this one is quieter easier
to install but in the day you're only
installing it usually one time so I
don't really think that's a worthy point
of discernment in the long run so if
you're interested in saving a few bucks
the hyper 212 Evo really does impress me
and this one looks really good
for the $30 or so price tag maybe a
little more maybe 35 bucks if it's
upwards of $40 then I think that that
point starts to dissipate but the dark
rock slim
it's 180 watt TDP cooler but it's it's
really performing like a hyper 212 Evo
so it needs something more than just
beauty and being a little quieter to
justify its price in my opinion so maybe
in the near future comes down maybe 10
bucks or so then I think I could be
totally on board with it it's still a
great cooler what I recommend it to most
people it's tough I mean if you're if
you're a real big real big fan of be
quiet components then I think this is
something you're already considering or
already own but for the general you know
purpose of like buying an aftermarket
cooler so you don't have to use the
stock in teller and be cooler which is
usually what people buy this for I think
this is the better Buy
full disclosure will be advertising this
cooler would be quiet here soon so
you'll see a few ads from them with this
and we're actually one of using this
cooler for the remainder of 2019 in our
taste test so you'll be seeing a lot
more of this cooler in the future I just
want to let you guys know we do plan to
advertise this and I'm not gonna hide
the fact that I don't think it's as good
of value as a 212 Evo I think and we've
advertised products that we don't think
are the best but that are still good and
that's what this is it's good it's just
not the best especially from a value
perspective it's still be quite cooler
silent winks three of some of the best
fans on the market in my opinion looks
really good installation is easy just a
little pricey at the moment so maybe
that will come down soon with that if
you guys liked this video let me know
but guess what a thumbs up I appreciate
it you guys have been awesome click that

already become a member if you're
feeling especially fancy now I'll catch
