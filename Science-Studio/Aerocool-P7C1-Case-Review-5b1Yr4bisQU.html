cool that sponsored us tearing our copy
text 2017 coverage there are a case
power supply and peripheral company
stationed out of Taiwan and what I have
today is something we showcased while we
were there a large mid tower PC case
with integrated RGB lighting a tempered
glass side panel and excellent
ventilation so I'll be completely honest
there is a lot more to this case than
meets the eye and once you do realize
how many things there are two kind of
tinker with and get right it can be a
bit overwhelming there are also several
variants to choose from including non
pro versions of both white and black c1
variants this here is the white p7 c1
pro model to be found in the video's
description and it comes well equipped
with tempered glass and a solid steel
frame aesthetically speaking this case
has a lot going for it now at first
glance this might appear to be a full
sized tower it is not by definition it
is simply a mid tower it only has 7 PCI
slots at the rear this also only
supports ATX motherboards knotty ATX
thanks to the indention on the right
side of the case which is useful for
cable management at the rear to large
speed span the length of the case and
also looked at a good bit off the ground
for adequate PSU breathing room behind
the glass you'll find a basement
spanning the same distance all the way
up to the front of the chassis where you
can store up to 3 120 millimeter fans or
radiator combos a large dust filter is
also included and the removable front
panel welcomes air with its many
perforations glad to see this in a case
this size
speaking of which yes this case is a bit
unorthodox in the sense that it's only a
mid Tower and it's pretty dang tall
probably one of the tallest mid towers
around and I thought that at first it
would not have enough room to store
cables in the back panel because it
doesn't look very wide it actually is
pretty wide it just doesn't look wide
because it's so tall so you'll find
plenty of cable storage space at the
rear there aren't any tie straps I wish
that they had included some of those you
have a few points in which to use some
tie straps too and a secure cables in
place but no what am I looking for
velcro straps that's the word so none of
those are included but I don't think
you're gonna need to really take the
time to write your cables there is so
much space in the back of this case I
think you'll be plenty happy with what
you have do keep in mind though on the
left side of the case where you'll be
building your PC primarily there is not
much space for a large CPU cooler so up
to 160
five millimeters I believe is the
maximum CPU cooler height anything
beyond that and you will be hitting that
tempered glass at the back of the case
you'll find a cutout for motherboard
rear i/o a 120 millimeter fan or rad
mount seven PCI slots as mentioned
earlier and a PSU cutout at the base I
like here how arrow cools included a PCI
bracket cover similar to how fantex and
others keep a nice clean and concealed
look just two thumb screws are not
captive but they're still there we'll
hold this in place remove it first to
install a graphics card or two then swap
it back on for that nice finish as for
storage you'll find four two and a half
inch drive bays as well as two three and
a half inch ones the two three and a
half inch ones are actually mounted to
the PSU from underneath they're not
mounted to the bottom of the case which
is an interesting approach also you'll
find two of the four two and a half inch
drive bays are on top of the power
supply shroud which is nice it's kind of
like an NZXT s340 vibe here there is one
large cutout for cable management if you
want to plug in HD audio though or use
that far-left SSD tray then you're gonna
have to kind of let your cables just
spread out over the basement a bit
because there's only that one large
cutout in the center I wish they'd added
a second one probably one of the only
major changes that I would have made to
this case up top you will find a very
nice array of features including a
standard USB 3.0 and 2.0 layout
power and reset buttons microphone and
headphone jacks and also an SD card we
directors two of a1 microSD and one
standard SD useful especially for
situations like my own where I'm
constantly swapping data to and from my
camera they're not the fastest card
readers on the planet I believe they're
using the USB 2.0 interface but it's
still nice to have them there in fact
the card reader I use right now is USB
2.0 face I just haven't bit the bullet
yet and purchased a USB 3.0 card reader
so I actually might be using this
instead further back on the top panel
you'll find a few grill slits for active
ventilation actually of a 240 millimeter
a IO up top and I was also able to
squeeze two 120mm fans and so of plenty
of room for cable management with the
motherboard below they do a decent job
and aren't too restrictive and while
there is no dust filter to remove up
here fans shouldn't really be said to
intake anyway this will be an exhaust
array now one of the selling points for
the c1 Pro not just the regular c1 the
pro model apart from the tempered glass
which is a deviation which I like and
it's slightly tinted it's not too tinted
to where I'd feel just like I can't
anything in there but it's nice to have
tempered glass in general the second
perk of going with the pro model is that
you have full RGB control integration
also full fan control with the included
hub Eric who calls this the p7h one and
it does allow for multiple RGB LED
strips case integration and fan RGB
integration all to be supported and
controlled by a single hub here you just
plug it into a USB port on your
motherboard also it acts as a fan hub so
the three front fans included with the
p7c when these are all RGB cables so a
separate wire for each of these fans
plugs into the hub for RGB control and
of course you also have your three pin
fan headers to plug into the hub and
control the fan curves there is a fourth
fan included with the p7 c1 pro at the
rear but it's pretty trashy honestly you
want to get rid of that one it's it's
very loud it doesn't do that great a job
at staying quiet so it's really nice
that air-cool includes the hub with the
purchase of the c7p one this case is
gonna run you anywhere between 150 and
200 bucks which isn't too bad I would
say a sweet spot for this case would be
closer towards 150 dollars think $200 is
cutting it that's the upper end there
but do take into account the fact that
you do get the hub which is in itself
maybe a twenty thirty dollar value you
get for fans three of which I suggest
you keep these are all RGB controllable
they all have separate cables for
controlling RGB functionality with the
hub not and the case also has integrated
RGB lighting so what I've done here I
really like this case I like how much
room it has being that it's only a mid
Tower I can still manage to fill up most
of this space with a custom loop and
that's why I threw one in here now it's
not finished the PDG tubing is gonna be
the last part of this project and that's
that's a whole project in itself but
that's what I'll tackle at a future date
I just wanted to show you what it would
look like if you wanted to do a custom
loop arrangement in here of course you
don't need that though you could stick a
360 mil radiator combo up front or up
top and it actually be pretty hidden too
you can see you can barely even tell
that there's a radiator up there with
two fans because there's so much space
up top which is really nice very custom
loop friendly case being that it's only
a mid tower arrangement and I'm looking
forward to finishing this I think it's
gonna be really cool by the way this is
a coffee lake 8700 K CPU in here with
the gigabyte c-- 370 gaming seven mother
as always you can find the p7 c1 in
white and black link in the video
description along with their non Pro
counterparts if you want to spend around
100 or so US bucks and you're not
getting the tempered-glass front panel
nor the hub I believe a few other things
that you'll just have to look at spec
wise but the cases are going to be
pretty much the same form factor wise
and that's what you got to keep in
consideration here this is a case that
is really bringing a lot to the table
it's not going to be the most friendly
case to build in there are a few things
I would change like I said the cutout in
the basement needs to be added the one
on the left side I don't really like how
the cables are kind of just supposed to
go through the small little opening
between the left and right sides of this
back panel
I would prefer rubber grommets that's
just me personally but everything else
about this case looks really good and I
can't wait to turn this thing on and
show you guys what it looks like what
it's all powered up so stay tuned for
that let me know what you think about
this case in the comments below and give
us my thumbs up if you're looking
forward to what this pcs gonna look like
when it's all said and done this is
