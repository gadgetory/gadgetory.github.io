personal computer your first thought is
probably something like SLI or crossfire
and that's completely understandable
these give either Nvidia or AMD graphics
cards running identical GPUs to work in
tandem the result is not a perfect two
time scaling factor when it comes to
frame rates but it's still acceptable 50
to 80% roughly boost when it comes to
most games for Nvidia graphics cards SLI
requires exact GPUs exact vram amounts
and of course an sli bridge as for AMD
things are a little less strict for
newer cards you'll only need two cards
with identical GPUs and that's pretty
much it
crossfire bridges aren't required for
the latest series of raid on cards and
vram does not have to match either
meaning that you can crossfire for
example two r9 380 s1 with 2 gigs of
vram and the other with 4 games simply
recognize the lowest vram card as
specified by the current configuration
but what about combining two cards with
totally different architectures is that
even a thing and if it is what is that
called well obviously it is a thing
because that's what this video is about
it's called explicit multi adapter or
EMA a term dubbed for the ability of
DirectX 12 to recognize and utilize GPUs
of different architectures theoretically
you can even run both your CPUs
integrated graphics alongside your
discrete GPU although it is recommended
that you pair GPUs of similar
performance for the best results
currently only ashes of the singularity
has support for this feature and it's
because EMA requires a complete
remapping of a game's architecture for
the sake of implementing SFR or split
frame rendering this has the effect of
splitting individual frames into
multiple tiles to be rendered by
separate graphics cards for instance in
this particular frame of total war
Warhammer if both an r9 290 say and a
GTX 970 are running in an EMA fashion
which Warhammer does not support
currently by the way then the 290 might
render these tiles and the 970 might
render these this dramatically reduces
latency improving frame rates and
response time so what did we use to test
with in our case both the gtx 980ti and
gtx 1070 were thrown into the same rig
do keep in mind that these cards will
not sli and a few we were confused about
that in the twitter post and that's
understandable I didn't really explain
what I was doing at the time but don't
try to do SLI this she's not gonna work
it's gonna be complete waste of time not
compatible
end of story our work is also boasting
an Intel Core i7 6700 K at 4.6 gigahertz
16 gigabytes of Gil super loose ddr4 at
3000 megahertz and an EVGA supernova 700
you what power supply in case you're
wondering how we power this pair of
cards with both cards powered and
plugged into the two uppermost PCIe 16x
slots windows in a video were able to
detect both cards and being that both
utilize the same driver it was ready to
go from the get-go
now because explicit multi adapter
relies on DirectX 12 to function we'll
need to make sure that we run ashes of
the singularity in DirectX 12 mode this
can be done by signing in to Steam right
clicking on the game within your library
and selecting run in DirectX 12 mode
simple as that after loading hop on over
to the options tab select video and
select enable multiple GPUs ashes of the
singularity will now utilize DirectX 12
and both of your installed graphics
cards to render the images you'll see
when gaming remember for our test we'll
be using both a gtx 980ti and a gtx 1070
two cards that are very similar when it
comes to performance if you're wondering
how we figured that out you can check
out the video where you benchmark both
of them in the card right here with that
let's find out how these cards do when
paired together and as you can see quite
the boost in performance for ashes of
the singularity no doubt but here's the
funny part when we compare these results
to those obtained from our solo tests
our am aid pair received exactly a 50%
frame rate increase for overall average
FPS from that of just a running single
980ti I mean exactly 50% what a
coincidence the overall average for the
combo was 80 point 4 FPS while our 90
DTI alone managed only 53.6 another
important find here is how well the
combo did during the heavy batches of
the benchmark when the cards were being
stressed to unorthodox levels both the
10 70 and 90 DTI struggled here yet when
paired they nearly doubled this average
frame rate to 70 3.5 FPS versus about 43
so for this particular combination it
appears as though the extra intensive
segments of the game benefited the most
which is actually great news and from
this we can make inferences about the
current state of explicit multi adapter
it behaves quite a bit like SLI or
crossfire does in terms of performance
benefits 50% is a solid framerate gain
for any graphics card combo and with
ashes being the only game not in beta 2
currently support EMA I'm actually quite
surprised by how well this games scaled
also given the current state of
asynchronous compute for both AMD and
NVIDIA cards you'll be better off opting
for an AMD graphics card as your primary
display device for games like this at
least until Nvidia gets there async
problems figured out if they ever do
come on green team in conclusion I was
presently surprised but we found
with our pair of cards even though the
GPUs are based on entirely different
architectures they managed to render
separate titles of each passing frame
without a hitch
reducing unwanted latency and boosting
those good old frame rates expect more
DirectX 12 games featuring explicit
multi adapter to be released in the
coming months if you liked what you saw
in this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up let us know you think we did a
good job
give us a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite or if you hate
everything about life click the
subscribe but if you haven't already and
stay tuned for this guy right here I
keep teasing it but JJ he's hitting the
tripod they can't stop stop what are you
doing I told you all I would try to get
him to stay still for a filming of a
YouTube video he's he's about to why me
I know he's about to stay chill for just
a few more seconds as I was saying stay
tuned for this card right here I keep
teasing it because well the day is
vastly approaching folks what on earth
are you doing whoa anyway this is
science studio thanks for learning with
this not going to drop it
