video interesting one because this is
actually a custom water cooling kit
right with hard line tubing inside and
it really comes with everything you
could possibly want and I would say a
pretty complex custom loop again
rigid tubing so you're gonna have to
bend this stuff you're gonna need a few
extra tools that aren't included in the
kit but the cool thing about this is
you're gonna get the fittings you're
gonna get the reservoir pump combo
you're gonna get the cpu block you're
gonna get the tubing the coolant the
radiator and some really dope looking
fans from thermal Hague as well and just
disclosure I'm not being paid for this
video or anything they send it to me to
you know just told me to review it so
I'm actually gonna build with it I'm
gonna save that for a separate video
because again this stuff takes a long
time to assemble and put together you
see my other customer builds you know
that so we're gonna do a run-through of
all the parts you get in this thing and
then we'll start preparing the loop in
the second video so stay tuned for that
for now here's what you get inside let's
take all the parts out this will be
interesting so I'm gonna try to set up
my tripod here as best I can and then
we're just gonna snap our fingers and
have everything laid out on the table
okay here we go three two one alright so
here it all is and it's actually quite a
bit now there are a few things I am not
sure about that honestly I won't be able
to give you a definitive answer on until
I actually build with all of these
components and you all know that custom
loops take a long time to put together
so we're gonna try our best to analyze
the parts at hand and make best with I
guess what we have at our disposal to
kind of give a review on and this is
gonna be a very in-depth review I just
want to show you guys what you get for
your money in the box here because
something I want to point out especially
if you're looking at this right here
these are all control boxes and you get
one of these with each of the kits you
buy so if you buy these three fans
separately what you can do you'll get
one these control boxes if you buy you
know the CPU block down there separately
you'll get a control box it's just it's
interesting because Thermaltake hasn't
cut down on any of those resources with
the bundle so you're gonna get four of
these and I really hope you don't have
to use all four because that will be a
major pain from a cable management
perspective regardless of the case you
use so okay we're gonna walk through
each of these I'll show you some b-roll
and talk about what each of these is
gonna do some things I see that missing
maybe
can use a few more of and some just
pointers before you actually dive into a
custom loop build like this one right
here so what's so special about this new
fitting well it's actually a three-piece
design which is not standard most the
time you'll see - I still have a collar
like this one right here you slide this
in through your tubing pretend my
fingers of tubing here so you slide this
backwards on the tube and then the area
you want to connect will funnel into
more or less a concave shape area and
that is where the G quarter thread is on
one side so let's say it's a CPU block
you're connecting it to and you get a
kind of wedge that tubing into place
slide the collar down and screw it in
all right I'm trying to my best to give
you a decent visual here so the third
piece is what simplifies things a lot
when you have to wedge that that tube
right into this concave shape it can be
difficult you have to bend the tube you
have to pull it back sometimes to get it
to align perfectly with that opening to
slide it in but this base plate is
special again it's flat so this slides
in on one side through a G chord of
fitting and then the other side has the
collar but you're wondering okay where's
the connection where's the seal right
had a prevent a leak
that's where the middleman comes in so
you slide this in through the tubing
there are o rings inside two of them I
believe yep so you have a pretty proper
seal there and then you can see they're
pretty loose there there's a lot of play
there that's not - you don't have to
worry about that there because the the
seal itself the connection is more or
less taken care of by the middle piece
not the collar and then all you got to
do is just align the two up you do not
have to you know pry the tubing back and
forth because there is no longer a
concave shape here with that middle
piece I don't know what you want to call
this middle piece then it just kind of
sits there so you don't have to you know
worry about prying your tubing or
anything like that especially if you
have SLI graphics cards those tubes are
difficult to get aligned especially when
they're already installed in your
motherboard so this simply allows them
to slide in place align them perfectly
they call our rests on top and screws
into the base plate it's a very simple
process I like this a lot more actually
despite having a third piece here very
simple by the way I'm not entirely sure
if only having two 90 degree fittings
here is gonna be enough I'd like to see
maybe four that would give a bit more
flexibility to the Builder to is just
cutting it really close you might have
some really tight bends where these come
in very handy and just having simple you
know lynnie
G Quarter fittings might not be enough
seeing that you only have two of these
here to work with so we'll see when we
build you're gonna have to keep the runs
pretty simple knowing that you're only
gonna have two of these to work with
this is the Pacific W 4 plus CPU block
this is a universal block meaning it
will work with anything from LGA 775 up
to a m4 on AMD side LGA 2011 2066 what
have you so you can buy this and be
worryfree
it has a nickel-plated base here it's
copper in design and it has RG bees that
run all the way around the outside so in
the pictures it looks really cool I
can't wait to see what this looks like
in real life it does have addressable
RGB ease up top via this pin and it does
come with a software control box like
this one here so you can run them
several different units into this box
and control it all via thermaltake
software so it's nice to have that
cohesive sort of software unifying
everything here this is all thermal
taking here again so it should be pretty
straightforward I actually like the way
the block looks it's it's simple it's
just I don't know it's circular and it's
black and it's a little bland in that
respect but I think when the RGB is
turned on it's gonna look really nice
that RGB ring design there it's just
it's simple enough to look really good
in my book this is a thermal take a ring
plus 12 fans 120 millimeter fan and it
does have RGB running all the way around
the outside with some bias here and the
frame too so you can see the RGB is from
the side and also from the back and you
do have the sticker here of course the
sticker looks a bit more ugly than the
front and that's the case for most fans
so if you run these with like an intake
and you're mounting these on the left
side of your radiator when you're
looking at your case from the from the
left panel then you're gonna see the
sticker and that's disappointing but
from the front it looks great I like the
thermal take redesign their logo made it
much more inviting much simpler and it
doesn't have that weird you know gaudy
color scheme going on so I think it's a
very good-looking fan and I think when
the RGB czar on it's gonna look even
better by the way if you're wondering
how the fan connects to your motherboard
it actually doesn't this fan is designed
to connect to a software box you'll get
another one like this included in the
Ring Plus fan kit and you just connect
one of these into the box like so and
then there you go now the box will
connect to your mother
and then you'll use the software to
control both the fan speed and the RGB
accents now one of the reasons why I'm
glad that you see 1000 pure coolant is
because it'll take on the color more or
less of the art jeebies that you shine
at it and if you want you can add dyes
that you can buy on thermal takes a
website designed to be used with C 1000
pure so this is gonna be more or less
like a closed ecosystem right so you're
not gonna want to use this coolant with
any copper radiator thermal take some
using aluminum rads for a long time I'm
not the biggest fan of those I wish they
had switched to copper a long time ago
again but this is made specifically for
aluminum rads if you uses the copper
rads you're gonna have issues guaranteed
it's gonna gunk up it's gonna it's going
to react with the copper and you're
gonna have a really bad time right
cleaning out not only the radiator but
all the crap that gets thrown through
your system because you didn't use the
right fluid so keep this within thermal
takes ecosystem you're gonna be
perfectly fine with it if you want it
you know die this thing a certain color
you can buy the dyes and thermal takes
website they're not expensive at all now
speaking of the radiator this one is
pretty beefy 64 millimeter thickness so
it's yeah it's definitely chunkier than
a traditional 30 or 45 millimeter
radiator and this one is again aluminum
so you only want to see 1,000 coolant
with this stuff or anything that's you
know made specifically for aluminum rads
aluminum loops if you're mixing this
with like nickel-plated stuff perfectly
fine nickel is not going to react in the
short term with anything really and
that's why they use nickel but if you're
using copper rads where there's bare
copper exposed to the fluid in your loop
then do not combine it with anything
else than the you know that has a bare
aluminum exposed in the loop that is not
good you're not going to have a fluid
that really keeps both in check in terms
of what's going galvanizes and so yeah
just don't mix them that's all I can
really say about that this is really
thick again it's it's got a four ports
here up top so I took off two of the
caps you do get a G quarter caps to
close off two of these actually three
because there's a third one down below
and this one is more or less like a
drain port so if you want to use
something like you know a ball valve or
something and then use that to flush the
fluid if you want to do that you have a
pour down here that'll be really
effective it's really a pain in the butt
to to flush fluid out of radiators
specifically especially when standing
upright but
again all the fluid has to leave up top
so it makes no sense for fluid to exit
up top unless you flip your system
upside down this gets rid of that issue
though but you're gonna need an extra
next drawer you know fitting or two if
you want to use a ball valve down here
ones not included by the way in the kit
and one other cool thing included with
the radiator this is like an RGB strip
that you just adhere to the side of the
radiator it's the perfect thickness it's
cut specifically for the red I just
showed you so it's got like a 64
millimeter or so thickness and it again
just adheres with 3m tape to the side of
the rad you can't use velcro straps as
well if you plan on moving this at some
point but it's pretty sticky as is and I
just recommend just sticking this on
there this is really only gonna look
good now with the Thermaltake rad
because it's cut specifically to those
dimensions so adds a bit of a WOW factor
to the rad and RGB rad of sorts is
definitely gonna look unique in an RGB
build now the last two things we have
the reservoir pump combo and the PDG
tubing which ptg tubing is just tubing
so it's really nothing special about
that but this is a d5 pump at the base
here so that Thermaltake branded d5 pump
you do have control of the pump speed
down below sorry my neighbors being
pretty loud across the street and this
is an acrylic reservoir tube and it has
two ports up top along with a cable that
you can use to control the integrated
RGB LEDs yes this reservoir has those
and it looks like you have let's see on
this side you have one port at the base
here so three ports in total with this
one I'd like to see a little more
flexibility maybe with the number of
ports on the reservoir but for an
integrated one here and you do get the
stands included as well see it's pretty
versatile with the way it can be mounted
this one isn't bad for being included in
a yeah and a kit of sorts for a custom
loop now if you're wondering what this
project will become we have the PCO 11
air from Langley here and I'm gonna try
my best to fit all these components
inside of this case it's a beautiful
case I've reviewed the dynamic check it
out right here but we'll be doing this
this review and build video and a future
future dates so stay tuned for that but
look forward to it because this is when
we'll get to utilize all these
components and I'll be able to give you
my final assessment on how I think they
look and how
they all function by the way if you want
this kit if you're curious about it
maybe you want to just jump on in you
can check out the link down below in the
video description and that's where you
can buy individually all of these
components or the entire bundle there
are several different tiers of this
bundle but if you want the Plus that's
when you get everything all the RGB
components and it's one I recommend if
you care a lot about aesthetics what
that's it I'm gonna end the video if you
like this one give it a thumbs up if you
dislike it give it a thumbs down we'd
sure to click the subscribe button if
you haven't already and stay tuned for
more content like this this is science
studio thanks for learning with us and
talking to my thumb my hand the entire
time because I haven't shown myself in
this video
it's kind of weird doing it like that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
