roll I do have exams coming up next week
here in college you know exactly what
I'm talking about so I'm trying to cram
as many of these videos as they can into
the end of this week because I'm gonna
be able to upload many next week but I'm
trying not to compromise on quality at
the same time it's a big tug of war but
I do have an AMD FX 8350 how to build
one and in about three minutes or less
you don't think it's possible try me
first up gather your parts pull out your
motherboard place it on its box and
prepare your CPU for the marriage align
the socket properly lift the retention
lever and gently set the CPU into the
socket after ensuring that it's fitted
properly lower the retention arm it'll
require a bit of force if you're using
the stock cooler hinge both sides of the
metal beam under the black mounted
supports and then twist the black lever
on the beam a full 180 degrees to secure
it into place connect the fan to the fan
header called CPU fan release dim
brackets two and four for a dual channel
array
align your ddr3 memory and force each
module into place the bracket should
realign themselves up right when the RAM
is secure next prepare your tower for
the merge fast on the rear i/o panel it
can be a bit tricky and then slide your
motherboard into place within your case
using the CPU cooler as a sort of handle
once it's properly aligned secure the
board with the included case grooves
grab a hold of your power supply connect
it to the mounting bracket if your case
has one and slide it into the opening
down the back at this point I like to
funnel my larger cables through their
respective holes in the chassis plugging
the 24 pin motherboard power cable as
well as the four or a tenth CPU power
cable now take your front I of
connectors locate their hitters on the
motherboard and plug positive into
positive negative into negative use your
mother words manual if things become
difficult do the same for the HD audio
header and any USB 2.0 connectors USB
3.0 should appear blue has its own
special header mount your storage
devices to the chassis and run a SATA
cable from one end into the drive and
from another into a SATA port on the
motherboard plug in any case fans at
this point and add any more if necessary
connect SATA or molex power to your
storage devices fan headers LED kits etc
next clear out two PCI slot covers grab
your graphics card and secure it into
the upper most PCIe 16x slot
again PCIe power that you added earlier
and secured the card to your chassis in
the back finish up anything you may have
forgotten an LED kit in our instance and
end your adventure by cable managing as
best you can in the back of the case
before fastening the left and right
panels back to the chassis there you
have it folks sorry I have to talk fast
because I'm trying to keep this video
under three minutes for the sake of
being able to put it in the title you
like to be - be sure to give it a thumbs
up if you didn't give it a thumbs down
and let me know why in the comments
below be sure to suggest future videos
also in the comments click the subscribe
button if you haven't already stay tuned
for future videos
this is science studio thanks for
learning with this
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
