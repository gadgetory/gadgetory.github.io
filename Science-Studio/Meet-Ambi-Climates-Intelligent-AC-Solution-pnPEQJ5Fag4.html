nfx this is where all of the startups
come to be known basically by the rest
of the world so innovations a lot of
stuff going on here startups trying to
get their name out there Kickstarter's
the works we are here with am be
climbing again so we work with last year
they've had several revisions of their
product they're still working on some
things they're gonna be really big this
year I want to talk about so I'm here
with Julian and Joey is going to give us
a rundown of what exactly to expect in
2018 the problem with air conditioners
today is that you can only really set a
temperature but then many other factors
that affect your comfort so things like
humidity or sunlight coming in the room
changing weather outside things like
that so the way our system works is that
through the app the user doesn't have to
set a temperature anymore
they just tell us if they feel you know
hot cold or comfortable and as they give
us that feedback we use machine learning
to build a personal profile of their
comfort so something like this actually
in general many of our users find that
temperature is not the number one factor
that affects them in general as things
like humidity or outdoor weather so
we're constantly tracking these factors
and as they change we automatically
adjust the air-conditioner so that users
find it more comfortable and many users
also save energy as well so in terms of
product updates you know a lot of what
we've been doing recently is you know
launch the second generation the device
so it's cheaper now and also in a much
nicer form factor so that's something a
lot about uses of like and we've also
been working a lot of new features like
for example their integration so we
already have an Amazon Alexa integration
working Prime and I working on Google
home right now so this will be ready by
the summer so we developed a me climate
to solve some common air conditioning
usage problems so for example you know
very common problems people have or
things like you know it's a good company
to pull a sleep out at night there's
always gonna be too cold the next
morning cuz your metabolism to slow down
and also you have a lot of common
problems like when the weather changes
outside you know if it's especially a
hot day you know people have to adjust
the setpoint temperature to get
something comfortable or if it suddenly
starts raining outside but a lot of
people find it something gets freezing
cold inside so that is that's why we
develop this AI to solve these problems
now on top of that of course you know we
have some very good you know others
typical small
pictures so I started in Boise
integrations I mentioned yourself we
also have features like a geolocation so
for example here my phone you can see
this is our office here in Hong Kong
so we basically you can set it up so
that it automatically turns on when you
come in and automatically turns off as
you leave so it's pretty convenient you
know for employees and it's not you know
scorching hot you know when the moment
they get into office right yeah yeah
definitely you don't have to leave the
AC on all the time Zack so basically you
just need this is a bright plug-and-play
device so you do need to plug in the
power and then you need to position the
device somewhere where there's a good
Wi-Fi coverage and also line-of-sight to
the air conditioner within about you
know five meters or about fifteen feet
or there abouts now in terms of the you
know air conditioners we work with any
air conditioner with a remote control
like this so that one that has an LCD
screen we're compatible with over fifty
brands and over 1200 different air
conditioner models so pretty much
anything on the market we can be
compatible with so here's the scenario
for you it's Taiwan right super hot here
very humid let's say I come to home from
I don't know a long walking park and I'm
very very sweaty I don't have to sweat
cash though because my AC unit assuming
I'm using
ambi climate is off right now thanks to
geo tagging but I walked back into my
home Wi-Fi and the climate knows that I
just have AC kicks on let's say after an
hour or two I'm still kind of hot I'm
not as comfortable that should be with
my AC unit but I can tell em be climate
in the app that I'm still uncomfortable
and through machine learning that
artificial intelligence to bake into the
product it will know over time what to
expect based on weather conditions how
humid it is things that are outside of
our control ultimately the product will
know how to adjust without me having to
give it direct feedback that's a great
hands off as long as it's accurate you
have nothing to worry about
that's exactly what ambi climate brings
to the table so in a nutshell this is in
affects a ton of relatively small boots
by comparison filled with a bunch of
startups trying to get their name out
there trying to be the next big company
look every company starts up as a
start-up so all of these companies
trying to make a name for themselves
wanting to give you a quick little
walkthrough here what to expect if you
show up to an event like this and I do
strongly recommend that if you ever get
a chance to attend Computex whether it
be in 2019 or 2020 nine to stop by the
initech the innovations area of this
event because you might find something
you really like maybe something to
invest in maybe something to try out
yourself because it might be the next
best thing we came back to a me climb
because we liked what we saw the first
time and I like the improvements they've
got coming out in 2018 to actually send
me unit myself and I cannot wait to test
it so that I can give you guys a
thorough and proper review of the
product for now we're gonna sign out we
have a couple more things to do here in
Taipei and then we'll be back home for
traditional coverage this is science
studio thanks for traveling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
