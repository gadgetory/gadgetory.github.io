comments and forums alike wait for Zen
seems to be the end thing right now if
you're not interested in spending more
than about 200 or so US dollars on an
Intel CPU and you're not interested in
the efficiency nor the single core
performance of an FX processor namely
the am-3 and f m2 plus line ups then
wait for zen but i've never really been
a fan of that phrase as much as I do
want AMD to come in and just crush the
market and force ent√£o to lower their
prices substantially in order to compete
we have to be real here it's taken AMD
almost five or six years to come up with
a process that is much more efficient
than the one they're currently using on
top of that they've pushed their
deadline back time and time again not
that any other company doesn't do that
but you get my point but it does finally
seem like Zen is in fact just around the
corner according to multiple sources and
that means yes ladies and gentlemen Zen
is in fact worth waiting for
so what the heck is this video about
then Greg I mean Zen isn't released yet
and I doubt you have benchmarks of Zen
CPUs and even if you did you'd be under
a nondisclosure agreement so you
couldn't release those anyway what do
you plan to do here I'm gonna get you
hyped up for it what I have here is an
FX 8320 ea4 module eight core CPU I have
a video explaining FX architecture in a
card right here but let's be fair it's
not the most efficient chip and it's
certainly not the most powerful which
probably explains its price AMD realizes
this it's why they've been taking so
long to refine Zen to make sure that it
is competitive with intel's current
lineup the jump from 32 to 14 nanometers
not only means a big changes in
efficiency but also IPC instructions per
clock which is essentially how powerful
a single core and any given cpu is the
bulldozer and piledriver limits were
never especially spectacular when it
came to single core performance which is
a big reason why they took huge
framerate hits in most cases in games I
mean take a look at these graphs here in
literally every game the FX 8320 e falls
significantly behind the i7 6700 K when
it comes to average and minimum frame
rates we can't of course blame AMD in
the sense that while this is 32
nanometer architecture compared to 14
nanometer architecture it's I mean it's
piledriver vs. skylight what do you
expect folks well I do expect AMD to
release something soon that should
compete with the i7 6700 K
and if we're looking at prices around
200 or 250 US dollars that will put a
huge target on the eye 767 hundred case
back
look I'm not showing you those graphs to
make Intel look any better that's the
last thing I want to do until needs
competition that is undeniable what I'm
trying to do is keep you away from a CPU
lineup that will undoubtedly become
obsolete in the coming days I can
finally say it with certainty folks
waiting for Zen is worth doing even if
you're planning to build an ultra budget
PC with either an FX 6 core or 8 core
processor I would argue that waiting for
Zen and buying their cheapest 4 core
processor would be the better bet and it
doesn't matter what game you play at
this point almost all games benefit from
stronger single cores I mean look at
Minecraft even a heavily modded version
in 1440p which utilizes more GPU than I
would like to think suffers dramatically
under an FX 8320 II literally half the
framerate across the board just another
reason to wait this is a matter of red
vs. blue who's on which side who claims
to be a fanboy and who claims to call
other people fanboys this is simply a
matter of price to performance something
that I expect the Zen will shake up the
market with I choose Intel for 90 to 95
percent of my personal rigs because
until CPUs are undoubtedly much more
powerful and don't result in significant
framerate cuts like we just saw budget
builders have a different question to
ask but you should altima be led to the
same conclusion wouldn't you rather wait
for a much better PC in the CPU
department then build one right now that
would honestly disappoint you if you
compared it to a CPU like this it just
comes down to patience ddr4 pcie 3.0
newer chips newer architecture all that
stuff can be enticing but are you
willing to wait for it grant it not a
lot of these things will have
significant impact on your day-to-day
computing tasks but when it comes to the
CPU itself
AMD Zen 14 nanometer architecture a
totally different design of a CPU core
for AMD is all of that worth waiting for
I say yes I hope you do too let me know
in the comments what you think be sure
to give this video a thumbs up if you
are hyped up at all give it a dislike if
you feel like a bit opposite or if you
hate everything with life and click that
subscribe button if you haven't already
this is cells are
studio I'll catch you in the next video
