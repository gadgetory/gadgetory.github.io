what I did in this video you're going to
void your CPUs warranty now whether or
not you're actually going to need to
turn in your CPU because it randomly
dies on you halfway through your
workload is a different story I mean how
many people do you really hear of
needing to RM a CPU usually if it's dead
it's dead out of the box I mentioned
this again later on the video but you
should keep that in mind because if you
do want that peace of mind then doing
what I'm gonna do here is definitely not
advised now with that said I think that
the benefits are worth it and under I
would say most applications and the
reason being is because most Intel CPUs
nowadays have terrible thermal
interfaces and that is the result of
Intel choosing to use very terrible
formal compound between the die and the
IHS most of us noticed by now
it's basically equitable the toothpaste
now I'm sure you've seen other prominent
tech tubers deal with CPUs on their
channels this by no means is a new
process it's definitely something we had
to resort to thanks to Intel's choice of
terrible Tim but is the first time I've
ever delivered a $2,000 processor and
I'm very nervous because I've never used
this tool before although I trust the
Bauer I mean the AI knows exactly what
he's doing and this is his tool here
that you can buy have it linked down
below along with a few other dealer
tools if you're interested so you know
if I destroy this 18 for 36 threaded
$2,000 chip I'm kind of screwed because
it's the only one I have and you know I
can't I can't afford $2,000 CPU so let's
go ahead and get to the dealer process
again a huge disclaimer this will avoid
your CPU warranty if you do what I'm
doing with any Intel see any CPU in
general actually I mean if you want to
even do you live like soldered on AMD
CPUs with ovens and special delayed kits
you can do that but you're going to void
your warranty so keep that in the back
of your head when watching this video if
you're deciding on whether or not
deleting is worth it maybe this will
give you the pros and cons of to the
pros being much lower core temperatures
but the con being it can't turn it if
you happen to destroy it
so let's get started
the Sennheiser PC 37 X is a new take on
gaming headsets prioritizing both a
sleek design and optimal comfort that's
a tricky combo their audio is top-notch
as always that's no surprise but the
microphone here is a thing of beauty
you're actually listening to it right
now not bad for a plug and play headset
click the link in the video description
for more details all right so the first
thing I wanted to do was set up a
baseline now this is a 79 80 XC it's
actually an engineering sample that's
why it says until confidential on it so
this isn't one you could just obtain on
the open market unless somebody who's
not supposed to be selling this sells it
on a site like eBay but it's for all
intents and purposes just a generic 79
80 XC and actually mine out of the box
is not a great overclocker so there's
nothing really special about this chip
in fact it's probably on the lower end
in terms of bidding I was sure to follow
the Aegean approved thermal compound
application method it's detailed on
their mod mat actually that I'm using
right now just to be consistent granted
this isn't going to matter at the end of
this video because I decided not to use
the IHS at all if our actually send a
direct dye application tool so that I
could just mount the cooler directly to
the die the CPU getting rid of that you
know first layer of thermal interface
between the die and a piece of metal
that's actually something I want to
touch on very briefly when you think
about the efficiency is involved with
transferring heat from the die up to the
CPU cooler and then to the air there are
quite a number of roadblocks in between
so kinda like a double layered sandwich
if you go because you have Tim between
both the IHS and the die and then Tim
between the IHS and the CPU cooler so
heat is being transferred between two
layers of thermal compound which is not
very efficient in its own right it's
better than using toothpaste under most
circumstances but it's still not perfect
and that can allow heat to build up over
the CPU and thus increase core
temperatures that's where a tool like
this comes in so handy it allows you to
eliminate one lifts to inefficient
layers of thermal compound effectively
lowering core temperatures it's why
deleting exists in the first place so
without further ado I present to you
stock Intel I 1979 ATX II thermals you
can see in i-264 stress tests that our I
9 reached about 60 to 65 degrees Celsius
it is hard to score this was again is at
stock though there was no manual
overclock no manual v core but we did
eventually above the beak or up to one
point
- and manually overclock across all 18
cores - 4.2 gigahertz and temperatures
were not that great we actually thermal
throttled a lot and that's why I don't
think that these results are actually a
fair interpretation of what's going on
at these frequencies because the CPU was
actually bottling down its frequency
1cor attempts became too high I know
this isn't a super controlled experiment
I don't intend for it to be I just
wanted to get the point across at
overclocking 18 core Intel CPUs I mean
really anything from the x-29 lineup
it's just a major paint sky like X is
not only super expensive but it's also
terrible from a thermal standpoint
because Intel uses such terrible Tim
between the IHS and the die of the chip
it effectively cuts the CPS at their
knees I mean why have unlock multipliers
if you can't overclock them because you
put terrible tires on a really fast car
to mean that it just makes no sense and
that's why we're going to deal it today
the next thing to do then is to remove
the CPU from the system and then use
this tool here to remove the IHS from
the chip when I say chip I'm talking
about the board underneath that big
metal plate it's actually really cool
and just mind-blowing to picture
something like this I mean this is
lighter than a potato chip but there are
billions of transistors packed inside
this tiny little mirror that's hidden
underneath this terrible thermal
interface from from Intel anyway just
picture it being super shiny and clean I
haven't cleaned this one yet but it's
just so light I mean it feels like a
potato chip but it is so dense and it's
so powerful it just makes you think you
know like how far we've come in 10 or 20
years so anyway back to this kit I know
it looks very daunting and kind of
confusing but it actually does something
very simple so as you twist this screw
right here you can see it puts pressure
on this little hinge this hinge applies
a reaction force to this huge thing here
just another chunk of metal again and
this pushes a plate that pushes against
the IHS of an i9 CPU so with the
included little torque ripple not with a
torque wrench but just a little tool to
use the torque this screw here you can
apply an intense amount of pressure to
the IHS eventually dislodging it it's a
- the chip by the way just lodging it
from the chip below it sounds super
scary I know you probably think you're
gonna just snap the whole chip because
of all the pressure that you're applying
to this thing but it's actually super
straightforward and I was surprised with
how clean the results were
now once the IHS is removed you're gonna
want to scrape off all this extra gunk
this was what was used to bond the IHS
to the chip I use a toothpick I just
kind of scrape through it you know the
chip itself it's pretty sturdy just be
careful there are a lot of different
components on this board very tiny
resistors and whatnot that could just
chip off if you're not very careful I
also recommend using nail polish or
something on the like to coat all these
tiny components because if you decide to
use liquid metal maybe conduct or not
that is of course conductive it's one of
the reasons why it's such a great
transfer of heat but it could
short-circuit your chip and create you
know bridges so electricity can pass
from component to component or it
otherwise shouldn't that'll kill your
chip you'll be very upset I wanted to
show you guys very quick see how does
this paste just kind of flakes off it's
almost like it's kind of crusty doesn't
want to stick to anything and that just
shows you how low quality it actually is
I mean you can like mold this stuff it's
not a liquid at all now if you plan to
direct dye mount a CPU cooler you're
going to want to remove the stock eye
lens is basically a loading mechanism
for the CPU it keeps it firmly pressed
against the pins on the motherboard to
ensure proper contact the reason why you
have to remove this because once you
remove the IHS of the CPU and you keep
it removed for direct die mounting the
total height of the CPU is going to be
reduced which means that first off this
socket thing here this lever is never
going to actually keep your CPU secure
it's gonna be wobbling around in there
because it's designed for CDs with IHSS
in the i-9 lineup also the cooler that
you mount on top of this bracket here is
going to be too high to make contact
direct contact with the die of the CPU
so you need a lower kit and that is
exactly what devourer offers for the i9
series just two plates and four Torx
screws and there we go we have direct
die mount ability with our i9 79 80 XC
something about this picture here just
looks extremely cool so now it's time to
apply mx4 thermal compound I'm not sure
exactly how to do this I know you want
to spread it evenly over the entire die
so I'm just going to kind of do
a Multi X pattern to ensure that enough
thermal compound is covering the dyes is
probably a little too much and I'm sure
people are going to scream in the
comment section but as long as the
entire dyes cover and you don't have a
huge chunk of you know thermal compound
between the cooler and the dye of the
chip we're gonna be okay
and I did lift this up the first time
after applying this to ensure that the
entire dye wasn't fact covered with
thermal compound and now for the results
first impressions I was definitely
impressed with the way that the CPU
handled itself under idle conditions at
stock we're talking room temperature
here I mean there was literally no Delta
between the temperature in this room and
the CPU core is at idle like 23 24
degrees Celsius and that again is thanks
to direct eye contact so that's
definitely a plus but let's see how
things handle now under load this is
where I expect we'll see the difference
and sure enough we did see a significant
difference in the way that see if you
handled itself I was and was getting
some weird air with i-264
but while the actual application was
running I saw the temperatures had
leveled off quite a bit they didn't
shoot up to 90 95 degrees immediately
like they had with the die you know not
being exposed directly to the cooler so
a bit of a mixed bag here I I don't want
to just go out and say yeah if you buy
an Intel CPU should definitely deal it
it's not something that I think is for
everybody in fact it's probably more of
an issue thing still even though I
definitely trust your Bowers kit way
more than just like a I don't know a
scalpel or whatever else you want to use
to scrape the IHS off the chip in
general his kids are very good I do
recommend them if you want to do it but
should you do it in my eyes I'm it's
really tough for me to recommend
honestly I mean I don't recommend I not
to begin with but if you want to deal in
like a 7700 K or an 8700 K I would say
the only circumstance in which you
should feel totally comfortable doing it
is if you maybe want to upgrade anyway
and you just want to see maybe this will
be the difference between you upgrading
and sticking with the current CPE that
you have because if you lose a CPU then
if you have a terrible deal it and then
CPU you know it's crack turd just
doesn't function anymore then you were
already planning on upgrading so not
much of a loss there now if you turn the
question back around on me and ask me
whether or not I would delete a
processor especially like this one here
that's so expensive I would tell you yes
now I didn't buy this something on a TI
see on my own that was sent to me by a
motherboard manufacturer but if I had
done this myself
I bought $1,000 processor before they
get I've spent a lot of money on CPUs in
the past not because I find that they're
worth it but because I am really
interested in testing those components
and in my eyes it's more or less an
investment I hope to eventually see that
return through revenue from videos and
ads you know that we put in videos
whatever but I would have done it at
least once if it failed I would never do
it again that's how I treat things like
this you know I will keep doing it until
I noticed that my Luck's run out and
then I won't touch it ever again that's
kind of how you know how people do it
when they are gambling in the casino
let's say you know and they keep
striking it big they keep winning to
keep winning then they have one big loss
that's where you call it quits you keep
going till you lose and then you walk
away I even do the blackjack and do that
with slots or whatever you're usually a
losing slot I don't recommend those but
if you wanna have a little fun and you
don't want to lose a lot of money that's
how you should do it and that's kind of
how I do it with these CPUs I've deleted
this is now my third D lid and I have
not had a failed delete attempt yet so
that's kind of where I'm going to leave
it it's really up to you I think it's
worth it especially for these hotter
chips although I 9 in general is just a
terrible platformer I think I wouldn't
recommend I 9 to anybody but if you do
have one laying around do you letting it
will definitely make it come alive it'll
lower your tongue so keep your system
quieter and it'll probably increase of
the lifespan your CPU to some extent
because it's not running as hot anymore
I do want to hear from you guys in the
comments section below though what do
you think about deleting have you done
it before is it something you've ever
considered if so why if not why not I
want to get some insight from you guys
and how risk-averse you are in general
and if you think something like this is
worth it give this video a thumbs up you
thought it was cool dislike it if you
feel like an played opposite click that
red subscribe button if you haven't
already you can join us if you want to
pay a special like $5 a month get like
badges and all that crazy stuff it's up
to you really
and be sure to stick around for more
content like this on the channel this is
science to do thanks for
by the way a special little insert here
while we're waiting for the software to
install before we run the test see how
easy it is to deal it a z-series chip so
we have the 80 600 K I believe in here
and this is good for any modern
mainstream Intel processor to fit in
this back as early as I believe we don't
want to try to deal in solder chips but
you could go back as early as well if
you wanted and I use this tool to t lid
so it's a very simple tool here I mean
there's little bit three parts so you
have the base and that's where the CPU
sits I don't turn it because it just
kind of sits inside there and you can
see there's space on the back as well
for the small little bits on the actual
board and then you slide this little
plate into it until it stops there's a
little Ridge on one side this is what
you're gonna torque into the IHS to get
it to attach a very simply take a little
tool like this start twisting it you'll
hear some weird sounds and there we go
so once it gives way you know that the
IHS has been detached from the board
from the chip itself unscrew this and
see how it turned out just totally
off-the-cuff by the way I didn't want to
you know planets wanted to show you just
how simple it is to use so it's slightly
crooked now it's because the glue that
they used to attach the IHS to to the
chip has now been dislodged and there
you go you can see crappy Intel Tim
under there we're gonna get rid of that
we're going to apply something next for
this as well you could go with something
much better I conduct an author more
grizzly whatever I'm using an X for just
because I want to show you how terrible
until Tim actually is so we're gonna
clean this up we'll scrape off the gunk
that they used to attach the IHS to the
chip and then we'll re reapply thermal
compound better compound and see what
the temp data is on this as well let's
see how simple it is like if it's you
know I know that you're a little worried
about doing something like this to a
chip right because you avoid your
warranty I mean how many times honestly
though are you gonna want to
turn a CPU right for a defective chip
that really happens usually if they're
defective they're defective out of the
box they won't die randomly on you but
nonetheless if you're comfortable with
that you can see how simple the process
is and this kit from der Bauer is the
easiest I've ever used</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
