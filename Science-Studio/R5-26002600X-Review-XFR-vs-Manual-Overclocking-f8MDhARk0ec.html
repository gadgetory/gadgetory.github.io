gonna be something along the lines of I
580 600k slash 8400 verse r5 2600 X
slash 2600 you guys get the point right
a typical benchmark video but if you
tech tubers already beat me to that I'm
still gonna throw those benchmarks in
this video but I want to focus more or
less than something that has been
covered very much yet and that is xfr
2.0 on the DL XFR stands for extended
frequency range and it does just that
allows the CPU to clock higher than the
advertised turbo boost so it's almost
like a turbo boost on top of a turbo
boost which is a bit confusing but xfr
2.0 will usually kick in if you have an
adequate cooling solution so if you have
a beefy enough air cooler or a IO or
custom loop then x4 2.0 will be able to
take full advantage of that extra
overclocking Headroom you might
otherwise have on a risin two chip I
just called it risin - and technically
Zen + is not rising - at least AMD
doesn't refer to their own architecture
that way so I really don't think we
should if you want to be consistent with
what they're showing us so what I should
have said was Zen plus or rise in second
generation I don't know these naming
schemes are getting really stupid anyway
the topic today's video I'm gonna
compare the r5 2600 x2 itself with xfr
2.0 enabled versus a manual overclock
the 4.2 gigahertz yes on a be 350 board
albeit with slightly crispy vrm temps
but everything seems stable nothing was
overheating during the 30 or so minutes
of just straight-up benchmarking all of
these games I hope that a dozen or so
included in this video
also some synthetics and I also decided
to throw in another Adobe premier render
so you guys can see how productive the
CPU actually is in the real world when
it comes to content creation something I
want to mention though before jumping
into these graphs the RFI of 2600 X in
my benchmarks in particular this is a
good reason for this I'll explain in a
second sometimes outperforms the are 727
or text in games not in you know
workload scenarios where you're either
rendering a video or using blender or
handbrake or what-have-you
obviously the higher core countship will
come out on top there all other things
equal for the most part they were here's
the distinction here's why in some cases
for the games the r5 comes out on top
with my benchmarks it's because the r7
was overclocked manually to 4.2
gigahertz across all course now the r5
was not manually
clock save the RAM frequency which I had
enabled XP profile for so 3200 Hertz on
the RAM timings I think 16 18 18 and I
want to say that is all I changed and
then I left the CPU frequency V core
base clock all of that unchanged again
in a be 350 BIOS the 2600 x1 in a few
cases because of x2 for 2.0 and what
happens is this X of our 2.0 allow
certain cores for very small amounts of
time to turbo to a higher frequency than
what I could manually get all of my
cores on the 2700 X simultaneously - so
4.2 gigahertz was it across all course I
didn't do per core overclocking just all
eight at 4.2 and what that does is
essentially offset any potential you
know overclock you could have on a
single core so maybe I could hit 4.4
gigahertz on core 1 but then 4.1
gigahertz on the other seven chords
right I didn't do that because that's a
very case-specific scenario well the
next of our 2.0 enabled for any of those
n+ cpus that aren't manually overclocked
the turbo frequencies at any given time
can be slightly higher than 4.2
gigahertz and because of this and also
because of the fact that many games
aren't optimized for six cores let alone
eight cores and 16 threads the 2600 X
occasionally comes out on top and that's
why I'm willing to say in this video
that if you play video games primarily
with your Zen plus CPU then you might
want to give manual overclocking a
second thought is it really necessary I
don't think so in fact I think you'll be
better off in many cases when it comes
to games with just letting X afar do its
thing now today's test bench is exactly
the same as it was three days ago when I
benchmark the 2700 X so a 10-7 TTI from
EVGA 16 gigs of DDR 4 o'clock to 3200
megahertz and depending on the platform
either a Z 370 or X 470 motherboard with
the exception of again the 2600 X which
I used to be 350 motherboard for more or
less just to prove a point
right that you don't need the most
expensive motherboard out there to hit
the overclocks that you desire by the
way a few of you tried to point out that
my 1070 Ti and the test bench was
somehow a massive bottleneck and that
all my frame rates are being skewed as a
result I wholeheartedly disagree with
that first off the 1070 Ti is an
insanely powerful car it's nothing to
just look at
man it's not bad at all in fact we
compared it to last gen architecture
right Maxwell stuff the 1070 TI is more
powerful than the 980 TI so by that
definition all of our benchmarks from
three years ago were invalid because our
graphics card was always the bottleneck
there's always gonna be a bottleneck no
matter what you do the idea is to
eliminate the graphics card bottleneck
as much as possible to leverage the CPUs
the most but then if you scale the
graphics card up all your frame rate
should scale about the same assuming
that your graphics card was the
bottleneck to begin with so the logic
there just doesn't add up to me and
that's why I'm using the 1070 T I also
it's just more representative because
not everyone is a 1080 TI which is the
best thing out there these are more
real-world results so starting off first
with Cinebench r15 I want you to pay
very close attention to the x-axis where
all the CPUs and their respective
frequencies are listed as you can see
the 1700 X from AMD reached 4 gigahertz
that was the highest overclock I could
attain with it
16:19 the multi-core side is not bad at
all it was by far though the lowest
scoring single core performer the 2700 X
which is essentially the step-up right a
generation above was able to reach 4.2
gigahertz with the x4 70 motherboard
that jumped our single core performance
up to 184 and the 1900 and 5 on the
multi-core side which is very impressive
the 8700 K from Intel which is by far
the best gamer in this lot scored 16 84
at 5 gigahertz again not bad and is also
the highest scoring single core
performer the r5 2600 X at stock scored
a 13 97 which isn't bad 186 in the
multi-core side and the r5 2600 X with a
manual overclocked to 4.2 gigahertz
scored 1489 so we can see how exif are
is really only benefiting a few cores
which is why when running its stock it
scored lower on the multi-core side of
things and we can see our lonely i5 8400
on the far right of course running at
stock because it has a lock multiplier
which is a shame only 942 on the
multi-core side 176 for the single core
peak bench 4 tells a similar story not
gonna spend too much time here the r7
2,700 is by far the best multi-core
performer and with a score 4890 is also
the best single core performer although
the i5 8400 at stock isn't far off at 48
40 on the far right now for Adobe
Premiere Pro more or less a real-world
render scenario a five-minute 1080p
60 FPS video file run through the h.264
YouTube 1080p preset resulted in the
following times the I 970 900 X at 4.6
gigahertz was the fastest render but
again not by far and the CPU is it's
just really not one you should consider
because it runs extremely hot it's very
expensive the platform in general is
very expensive and look the i7 8700 K is
not far off at 5 gigahertz it runs
cooler the platform is cheaper and yeah
you're just gonna have a better time
with this one but then look to the left
again at the r7 2,700 X is only 10
seconds slower at 4.2 gigahertz this is
a manual overclock we do expect the
manual overclock to benefit us more in
these work oriented scenarios the course
with games things will change you'll see
that shortly the r5 2600 X add stock
resulted in a 264 second render time not
too bad especially when compared to the
similarly priced I 580 400 it's stock
and if we manually overclock to 4.2
gigahertz across all our five cores 260
is our time in seconds that's just 4
seconds shaved off going from stock to a
manual 4.2 overclocked this kind of show
us how Adobe Premiere Pro slightly
favors frequency a bit more than core
count to an extent
now these gaming benchmarks or where I
think the r5 2600 X definitely shines
not only because it's again around $200
which is an insanely good price for what
you're getting 6 cores 12 threads
overclockable and on cheap platforms -
that is everything you'd ever want in an
affordable content creation and gaming
oriented platform so all of these CPUs
you see from here on out these
benchmarks were tested at the following
frequencies the 1700 X at 4 gigahertz
the 2700 X at 4.2 gigahertz the 8700 K 5
gigahertz and the 2600 X left in stock 4
xf r 2.0 to do its thing and check out
grand theft auto 5 in the 1080p
resolution the 2600 X definitely holds
its own only a for fps Delta between
averages with it in the 2700 X and it
actually performs better with 0.1% lows
which means a stuttering was less
frequent with the cheaper 6 core
counterpart we see the opposite trend
with player unknowns battlegrounds in
1080p the 2700 X holds a 124 average
framerate 70 on 1% lows and 36 the
lowest point 1 percent of frames and the
2600 X basically performs neck-and-neck
with
700 X down to the lowest point one
percent of frames where it falls short
by 12 fps so bit more stuttering with
the 2600 X I would say the extra cores
in this scenario do aid the 2700 X
despite the frequency difference now
fortnight was a bit weird the 2700 X
performed better than at 1700 X
counterpart and the i7 was by far the
best performer we also experienced the
highest point 1 and 1% lowest with the
i7 but the 2600 X performed very well in
the average side actually outperforming
the 2700 X and also in the 1% lows but
then check out the 21% lowest the most
stuttering occurred of all for these
CPUs with the 2600 X so I would say that
in this case both the frequency range as
well as the limited core count even
though 6 is plenty are holding the r5
back and deal with a super weird one I
almost threw this benchmark out because
I don't really believe what I'm seeing
here the game did not update again
everything with these benchmarks is
exactly the same but the r5 actually
performed better on average and then the
i7 8700 K in OpenGL these CPUs by the
way have the same core counts and they
both have multi-threading enabled and
even down to the 1% in point one percent
Louis the r5 kept up with the 8700 K
which is clocked much higher mind you so
again an OpenGL kind of confusing the
2700 did not do very well all I saw a
lot of stuttering with that CPU so I'm
kind of curious as to why the r5 did so
much better this is more or less just an
observation I wouldn't take this one
face value take it instead with a grain
of salt
battlefield 1 DirectX 11 1080p ultra
preset this one's also super interesting
the r5 and the r7 from Zen plus are both
performing basically neck-and-neck with
each other here the 2600 acts actually
pulls ahead when it comes to 1% and 0.1%
lows and almost matches the i7 8700 K at
5 gigahertz being this one's more CPU
core oriented right having more cores is
definitely better because i5 s that are
quad core i5s 10 to max out see if
utilization with battlefield one I
expected this one to be a bit different
than what we're seeing here but this is
great news for anyone looking for a
budget system right the r5 is doing very
well right now
rise of the Tomb Raider and DirectX 12
1080p high settings no anti-aliasing
resulted in the r7 2700 XR losing in the
first title this is the peak it's the
first one you see when you run the
benchmark and
the r5 2600 ex actually basically
performing on par with the 1700 X and
the i7 8700 K coming out on top
something else to note the r5 2600 X is
basically outperformed in the second
scenario at least the 80s 700 K the 2700
X and the 1700 X so this one was the top
dog for the second scenario the third
one it was a few frames off on the 8700
K and still managed to outperform the
2,700 X so things again looking really
good here for the 2600 X now planet
coaster in 1080p max settings is more
less what I'd expect from the CPUs
basically neck-and-neck the 2700 X did
have a 2 frame rate jump over the 2600 X
but I would call that within the margin
of error and everything else was
basically within the same range 2 FPS 2
1 FPS with the 0.1% lows you're seeing a
side-by-side comparison here the two and
they look practically the same and
that's why one percent in point one
percent lows are so important because
they account more or less for the micro
stutters you would otherwise not see if
you just saw the average minimum frame
rates f1 20:17 was another weird one
just by the way that these two stacked
up against each other the r7 2,700 X
outperformed the r5 by a long shot on
average but the r5 still managed to
somehow maintain a 5 FPS lead on the
minimum side of things so take this with
a grain of salt because these aren't one
percent pointers and Louis but still an
interesting observation nonetheless
universe sandbox 2 resulted in just 60
FPS on average for the r7 2700 axises
with the earth and sphere of moon
simulation the one I always run in the
high setting preset the r5 2600 ex
scored 11 fps higher on average this I
think is where acts of our 2.0
definitely shines in games that are
leveraging two to three cores heavily
you're gonna want to keep your CPU just
at stock settings and let X afar do its
thing because if you manually overclock
you're hindering your cpu from hitting
any higher frequency in a few cores
where it matters and lastly with witcher
3 i was able to breathe again so the
2700 x and the 2600 x scored the exact
same score and this might juice with me
manually benchmarking there's no
built-in benchmark with winter 3 so I'm
kind of just trying to do the same thing
in game and that's why these fluctuate
just a little bit but 112 fps on average
is great to see for both CPUs because
this is so GPU intensive
we don't expect our CB to make much of a
difference up to a certain extent so
there are three things that I ultimately
want you to take away from this video
the first is they're interested in
content creation or doing some CPU
intensive tasks that require multiple
threads multiple cores obviously the r7
CPU is the better vet but the second
point if you're gonna play primarily
games you're not gonna see much of a
difference at all especially when you
don't manually overclock between the r5
2600 or 2600 X and the r7 2700 or the
2700 X and third time back again into X
afar and manually overclocking if you
primarily play video games you don't
need to manually overclock just let X 4
do its thing because most games we can
assume will usually leverage between
four and six cores efficiently leaning
more towards four cores still but
eventually we expect six cores to be the
mainstream thing right and then manually
of core like I might benefit a bit more
before right now I think that letting
xfr do its thing is the better bet for
gamers and even if you content create
look you saw with the 2600 X scenarios
at 4.2 gigahertz across the board and
XFR 2.0 enabled we know one or the other
they basically render the video file in
exactly the same amount of time and
actually if you're scrubbing or throwing
work stabilizer do anything that's more
or less like single core oriented then
EXIF are 2.0 is going to benefit you
more in those scenarios so even on the
content creation side I don't
necessarily see the benefit of
overclocking unless again you're gonna
max out all your threads in those
scenarios so I hope this video at least
sheds a bit of light into the true value
of horizon 5 CPUs especially with Zen
Plus this is why I've said for the
longest time that the r5 1600 is the
best bang for the buck CPU because 6
cores 12 threads 200 bucks and it's
overclockable
boom it it plays games fine it content
creates fine I'll let you stream fine
it's the best of everything and it's not
very expensive and you don't have to buy
an expensive board to overclock the
thing this same goes for the 2600 X the
benefit here though is that in some
cases you might have slightly higher
slightly lower power draw so it really
didn't change much even though we got a
higher boost frequency out of that but
at the same time you don't even need to
manually overclock to get the best out
of your trip especially when it comes to
most games out there and that is just a
win-win for everybody right ease of use
come on who doesn't want that and that's
why I'm willing to say that the are five
twenty six hundred and twenty six
hundred X are the
best value CPUs I've ever been chucked
on this channel hands down you just
cannot get a better combination of both
value and performance from a cpu out
there unless you buy something from your
buddy for 10 bucks it's worth $100
obviously great value there but on the
in the new market right MSRP prices
these two CPUs are just phenomenal for
what they are now if you're concerned
about the choice between the 2600 and
the 2600 X I I really can't say too much
on it yet because I haven't tested the
2600 but I'm willing to say that if it's
anything like the 1600 was with respect
to the 1600 X then the 2600 is going to
be the better buy because it's gonna be
cheaper it's not gonna come with as
beefy a cooler so if you wanting to
stock cooler that might influence your
decision and rightfully so but if you
have an aftermarket CPU cooler like an
AIO or you know a bigger air cooler then
I think the 2600 is gonna be the better
bet I'll definitely get my hands on one
eventually and we'll confirm that but
for now I think you're gonna be
perfectly fine with the regular 2600
save the extra 30 bucks buy yourself a
nicer CPU cooler and let that thing just
cruise at its turbo frequency with that
