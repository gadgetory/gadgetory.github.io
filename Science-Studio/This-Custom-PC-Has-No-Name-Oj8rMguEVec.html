the pipes in really only four runs one
of them was way back here behind the
reservoir that was put in place in part
one of this little build series and then
I finished this Bend right here and this
one leading from the graphics card to
the top of the reservoir so the fluid
direction because of the way this is
orient is a primo chill pump res combo
here the fluids gonna be forced out the
back you can't really tell camera is not
gonna really do this justice and it's so
crammed in this case there's not much
room but that's what I like I like the
fact that it's really compact so
everything's gonna look filled up and
used so the fluids gonna enter the
radiator up top from the reservoir which
is just a good conventional setup here
and then from the radiator down to the
CPU block and then from the CPU block to
the graphics card and then from the
graphics card up to the reservoir and
now a few people were concerned about
the fact that I only have a single 240ml
radiator in here I understand where your
concerns coming from most of the custom
we build you see online or just overkill
over the top they don't need you know to
for a team or adds a few were saying
well why didn't you throw a 360 in here
or a second 240 up front or something
but if you look at it on a component
basis this graphics card has a single
120 mil rad space and the CPU has
another 120 mil rad space 240 is fine we
all know that you can pair a graphics
card with an AI oh and a single 120ml
rad and it's going to stay perfectly
cool granted it is a separate system
when they're broken apart like that but
even though we're including both into
the same loop temperatures will still be
fine we'll run tests and thermals after
this videos up just to make sure that
everything is stable now this has been
proven time and time again I'm pretty
sure Jay did this similar video and they
see at a graphics card a CPU and cooled
it with a single 240 ml rad and
everything was just fine so the next
thing on our list we're gonna fill this
puppy up with some coolant some food
we're gonna put a paper towel down here
at the base in case anything leaks
shouldn't be any leak so these fittings
from pre Mitchell are excellent to get
that super tight seal in here with a
single airing which is pretty incredible
and they look great in white the only
thing that's not from primo chill that's
custom loop friendly in this case is of
course the fantex graphics card block
and the Thermaltake cpu block now I'm
not gonna tell you what color coolant
I'm putting in here you're gonna have to
just watch the video or if you skip
ahead shame on you you're missing the
tech porn speaking of which here goes
all right so a small little issue not
really small we'll see how it turns out
when the computer is actually
benchmarked and stress test but there
are air pockets in this loop that are
literally impossible to get out without
dissecting each run and trying to fill
the fluid in each of those runs because
I can't get these pockets of air into
the reservoir and that's where I'm
filling the loops from the reservoir the
issue the reason why this is happening
is because the radiator is up top here
and there's a huge pocket of air in here
that's very difficult to get rid of
I've tried rotating the case making the
reservoir the highest point in the case
I've rotated it probably 50 or so times
just trying to get these pockets
circulated through the graphics card
block CPU block and into the reservoir
but then every time I do that because
there's a port on the back of the
reservoir air pockets just move right
back up into the radiator so no matter
how hard I try to get these into the
reservoir the reservoir will just have
pockets of air leak into the radiator so
we're gonna see how this turns out with
temperatures for now though it is a
finished loop with the exception of
those air pockets and the cool thing is
when you turn the PC on despite there
being air pockets which will be creating
thermal issues for sure you can't
actually see the fluid moving which is
pretty cool all right
I've been running heav'n benchmark here
for a little bit and 45 degrees Celsius
at the core pretty sweet so it means
that the little air bubbles in here
circulating through the loop aren't
detrimental to any major extent I am
perfectly fine with 45 degrees Celsius
now as for the CPU the temperatures here
reported at 68 degrees Celsius now this
is not under load by the way so you can
see usage years yeah it's around 50
percent or so for maybe half the course
half of them are turned off do I have oh
I must have SMT disabled that's weird
anyway so 69 degrees Celsius now
remember this is a this is a 20 degree
offset so AMD do this purposely with the
1700 X and the 1800 X so this is
actually a 49 degree Celsius temperature
it's just being offset by 20 degrees
because AMD AMD
well here you go it's all hooked up and
it looks like it's running fine I've
stressed tested it for about an hour or
so and the GPU and CPU got up to about I
think the GPU got to 55 degrees Celsius
which is pretty good after an hour
in the CPU got to I think 80 and that's
with a 3.8 gigahertz overclock modest
voltage nothing too to optimal I just
did the basic settings and the bio
speaking of which this Taichi x3 70
board from asrock has a beautiful BIOS
the updates are consistently rolling out
for Rison and that's why I like this
board so much and that's why I recommend
it to anybody looking to build a rise in
PC the Taichi x3 70 from asrock is one
of the best overclocking and just RAM
support boards out there for Rison also
if you're wondering the RAM colors
they're doing the whole rainbow effect
right now I haven't changed those yet
but g.skill has software that I've
showcased before that we can use to have
this alternate between say red and white
which is the theme going on in here so
all in all I'm very satisfied with the
build I'm glad that the graphics card is
no longer sagging and at its vertical
position right now and the fluid is it
I'll be honest it's not as red as I
would have liked for it to be it's
actually a bit more pinkish than it is
red only because of the air pockets in
there so if you just look at the fluid
when it's stagnant it's a very deep red
but when the air bubbles get moving
through the loop it does turn a bit
lighter if you'd like to see some
benchmarks this build maybe in the
future run some temperature tests will
run some stress tests see how this thing
fares with only a 240 mil rad which many
of you are concerned about in part one
let me know in the comments below if you
liked this video or maybe like the bill
be sure to give this video a thumbs up I
appreciate that subscribe for more
content like this and also let me know
in the comments what you think I should
name this beautiful machine I'm gonna
call it beautiful because I really do
think that it looks good I think it's
one of my best custom builds to date not
only because well it's got a red white
theme which can't go wrong with red and
white but also because of the few you
know just modest mods I've done here
with the graphics card and orienting the
components in the case in such a way
that you didn't have to really do
anything with a basement which is cool I
don't like having a big old hole in the
basement for the pump and what I just
looks that out just a bit more ugly
that's just me for the list of parts
used in this PC you can check out the
video description some of those links
are tied to my Amazon affiliate account
which just gave me a small kickback
that's a punch back up kick back I'm
kicking but you can't see it just that
small chunk of change that I usually
recycle back into the channel buying
more PC parts and stuff like that to
just show off cool things maybe buy some
really interesting tech that
you wouldn't think to buy but that you
know what the heck for science right and
then if you see new egg links those are
not tied to any affiliate account of any
sort I actually don't like new eggs
ability program because they don't have
their own proprietary program they
actually use CJ and a few others that
just are terrible they're just terrible
compared to amazon's affiliate program
so good on you Amazon even though
they're a bit picky about where you put
links and how you do it and this and
that those small kickbacks do go a long
way for me this is science studio I hope
you enjoyed the PC build thanks for
building with us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
