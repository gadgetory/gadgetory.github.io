so let's get to it step 1
refer to your watercoolers manual step 2
happy overclocking this is science to do
thanks for learning with this no we're
not we're not done I thought we were
done I'm just kidding okay
problem came up when I was installing
this NZXT crack in X 31 I had never
installed a water cooler like this one
before so I opened up the manual and
this is it I mean literally it's it's
one page and it consists of eight steps
eight steps to install the water cool
and they're really not even they're not
even there's no writing it's just
pictures and the pictures are not good
at all this is a terrible manual for
anyone who has not installed a water
cooler before you will be completely
lost unless you have assistance or
you're just really good at puzzles
because that's basically what that thing
is so this video is dedicated
specifically to the NZXT crack and x31
but I'm going to expand this to most
all-in-one water coolers in general
including the coarser h9t which I
featured in a previous build you can
check that video out right here if you
haven't already these are all very very
similar this is a 140 millimeter
radiator water cooler and this one is a
120 millimeter but the process is
roughly the same regardless of the
regardless of the company that you
choose to go with to cool your CPU so
let's jump right into those steps stay
tuned
first things first gather the massive
materials that you'll need in order to
complete this task you will need the
following your radiator of course for
the attached water block and mess of
cables the screws bolts and risers that
correspond to your socket type in our
case the LG 1151 socket the
corresponding backplate for your system
a screwdriver kit and if you're removing
an old cooler some pure or near pure
isopropyl alcohol and a lint free cloth
unless you are rebel like myself and use
tissue paper instead which I actually
don't recommend before anything else
take off the front and back panels of
your case if you're removing a
previously installed heatsink pay
special attention to these next few
steps however if you're putting together
your PC for the first time click the
link in this video now to skip ahead you
really don't need to see this part if
you're using a stock cooler in
particular first unplug the 3 or 4 pin
fan from its header it should be the
only set of wires coming from the cooler
gently twist the four pins holding the
unit in place and then pull up on each
lever until the cooler is released set
it to the side for now next we'll need
to clean the old thermal paste from the
heat spreader of your CPU grab the
isopropyl alcohol and your lint-free
cloth or a few folded sheets of tissue
paper pop the cap open hold the closets
that are firmly over the bottles opening
and then shake up and down until a small
amount of alcohol has soaked the fabric
then run the lightly soaked cloth over
the thermal paste atop the CPU heat
spreader be sure that the alcohol is not
running down the fabric and onto any
other components within your system
repeat the process a few times until the
CPU heat spreader is once again
completely shiny and completely dry at
this point we'll want to assemble the
water cooling unit grab the radiator the
included fan and the set of long
extended screws we'll be utilizing the
push method here so we'll want to orient
our fan in such a way that it pushes air
through the radiator fins if you're a
bit confused about which direction air
will flow through the fan and arrow on
the side of the fans frame may be
available to indicate airflow direction
secure the fan into place with the
included four screws if you're using a
radiator with more than one included fan
install these as well be sure that the
fan is secured in such a way that its
lead wires won't be in odd positions
when the radiator is finally mounted to
the PC chassis following take the
fastener corresponding to your CPU
socket type square thread pattern for
Intel and rectangle for AMD typically
and latch it to the base of the water
block
if it isn't already there it should lock
after simple rotation pick up the
corresponding bracket and secure it from
behind your motherboard once the four
pins are poking through the PCB grab the
support screws that have equal lengths
on either side if you're using a cooler
that isn't an NZXT kraken cooler this
might be where things begin to differ a
bit but don't worry I'm sure you're
using manual is much better than mine
double-check the connection types and
secure the support screws into the four
pins at this point the back plate should
be loosely secured grab a hold of your
kits included thermal paste if it isn't
already pre applied to the base of your
water block or some third party grease
if you've got any on hand any of these
will do just fine if you're applying
manually be sure to dab only a sliver of
the paste atop the CPU directly at its
center it should be rather sticky so
doing this while the PC is standing
upright shouldn't be a problem but just
to be safe you may want to do this with
a computer lying flat next we need to
mount the radiator and secure it to the
PCs chassis using a smaller set of
screws that correspond to the holes at
the back of your radiator fasten it to
the fan mounting point of your choice
preferably at the front or back I'll be
mounting mine to the back of the NZXT
s340 once the radiator and fan are
secured grab the opposite end of the AO
cooler the water block and align the
fastener with the support screws slide
the block on top of the CPU through the
supports and while holding the block in
place use the larger thumb screws to
sandwich the entire assembly together I
don't recommend using a screw driver to
fasten these thumb screws as any
unwanted stress could actually fracture
the plastic backplate and that's a big
no-no just turn them with your fingers
until the screws themselves build up a
significant resistance this should be
done in a cross pattern for relatively
equal force distribution double-check
that your pipes are routed appropriately
and ensure that no cable leads are
wrapped up in circuit components or fans
or anything like that
grab the shortest cable lead the one
with the either three or four pin
connection holes and plug it into the
CPU fan header on your motherboard the
longer cable on the Krakken is for the
USB support for use with NZXT use cam
software so run this down the back of
your tower and plug it into the USB 2.0
header on your motherboard throughout
the cable sprouting from your radiators
fan and plug it into any chassis fan
header on your motherboard but even a
CPU header would do just fine after
double and triple-checking can
actions and cable pipe routes reassemble
your front and back panels and turn on
your computer let it run by itself at
idle for a few minutes and then for a
few more minutes under a full load to
ensure that no leaks are present within
the loop some of these leaks won't show
up until the liquid begins moving very
quickly there altogether rare and all in
ones like this one but it never hurts to
double-check after all water damage do
any of your components in a system like
this one will likely not to be covered
by any warranty and don't forget about
that old cooler if it's now just sitting
by itself stored in a box for later just
in case if your water cooler does happen
to die at some point you'll want a
temporary backup so there you have it
folks
as you can see not very complicated at
all I would say that the most difficult
part about installing an all-in-one
water cooling unit is just finding what
parts you need what parts you don't some
systems come with many different kits
you know four different socket types you
have am3+ and and l.j 1151 LGA 2011 v3
you have a lot of different socket types
so you will naturally have a lot of
parts for a water cooler that is
universal that is it can be used on any
socket type so once you have sorted
through those parts and figured out
which ones you need in particular it's
fairly straightforward just follow this
guide or follow your manual if it's a
good one don't follow something like
this I mean you can try but it's this is
just terrible they shouldn't even
include one if they're if they're going
to just just completely drop the ball
like that so if you guys liked the video
be sure to give it a thumbs up if you
didn't like whatever reason give it a
thumbs down let me know what you would
like to see improved in future videos
and what you would like to see just in
general content wise on the channel if
you have suggestions for future videos
or constructive criticism or maybe you
want to just brag about your cool
water-cooled PC be sure to leave all of
those comments in the comment section
below as well remember I read every
comment that you all post I appreciate
them all thanks so much for being a
great community
this is science studio thanks for
