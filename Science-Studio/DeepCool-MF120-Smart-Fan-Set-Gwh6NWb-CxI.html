sending us to Computex 2017 we are here
at the deep cool booth Computex 2017
they have a lot of new products that you
probably haven't seen yet we're going to
check all of those out stay tuned now
the first thing that probably caught
your eye on the last clip with this very
large deep cool logo slash billboard and
what they did to illuminate their actual
name is line a bunch of fan out and the
first clip you probably were wondering
what on earth they use to illuminate
their large name on this very large
billboard right at the entrance of this
copy text exhibition center they're
using their new fans RGB integration
beautiful aluminum chassis design and
there actually is no frame if you take a
closer look let's go check them out so
this is their frameless fan I didn't
even know this was what I was looking at
when I first walked up to this booth
these are extremely cool and they're
using the same multi blade design that
they have and they're gamers storm fans
theories now what you're looking at here
is actually two kits in one when you
purchase one of these you get an entire
set so 3 fans as well as the controller
and the controller to some very cool
things along with your phone
thanks to Wi-Fi support so this is the
app open the app you can control not
only the fan speed but also of course
the integrated RGB accent so powerful we
can speed the fans up
they definitely ramped up in rpm regular
and then of course silent and like I
said apart from fan control itself you
can also control the LED accents of
static mode reading modes watch the
light change colors you can do flashing
again all controlled over Wi-Fi so
wireless control is included you can
change the brightness so if we do static
we just slowly drag this color wheel
around you can see that the fans LEDs
are changing colors according to what we
select you also have some presets in
here as well to make things nice and
simple so a lot of control involved with
these fans and it's all thanks to this
box up top now I know you're dying to
see these fans and action so we've got
the massive quad seller case I can pack
a ton of stuff into it and the fans are
in this build we're going to show you
what they look like to get a sense of
just a very clean design with these fans
involved I know you're probably thinking
yourself okay well a fan without a frame
doesn't seem all that viable but when it
comes to looks which is what a lot of
people care about nowadays and RGB
functionality these fans packed both of
those into a single unit I want to give
a huge thank you to deep pool for
showing us around their booth here for
taking our team to compensate 27 we make
no secret there are very large sponsor
of ours the reason why I was able to
bring a crew with me to make these
videos seem a bit more professional was
in large part because of them so special
thanks to them for that I'm very excited
about the products that they're about to
release I'll get my hands on them review
them on the channel at some point in the
near future
this is science to do thanks for
traveling</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
