an interesting camera perspective this
time around I'm using the webcam on top
of my monitor only because most what
we'll be doing will be on screen so
you'll see just the screen capture but
most of the time when you watch videos
on this channel the cameras somewhere
over there pointing this way so that's
actually where I sleep this is my
bedroom flash office and kind of make do
with what I have so today's video is
sponsored by wicks they wanted me to
show you guys how to create a website
easily that's something that wicks
wanted me to emphasize because they have
an awesome platform that I've actually
worked with in the past I've just never
got around to making a website for the
channel but thanks to their partnership
now we've been able to do that we have
our own domain secured WWL our studio YT
calm and we're going to link that domain
to the website we build in this video
I'll show you how to do all of that so
you can see here we have our domain
secured and we haven't actually
connected it to the website we're going
to be building within WIC so the site
isn't published yet so if you actually
typed some of their studio y TN right
now because I do it just because I'm
serious studio YT calm so you can see
that the domain is connected to Wix but
there's no website there yet it's just
showing that there will be one soon once
we publish it so that's what we're going
to do now we're going to build this
website from scratch we're going to run
through just the different steps the
different things you could do to make
your website different make it unique
you can link all kinds of different
social media account to the website to
make it as interactive as possible for
your fan base so we're going to hop back
on over to the kind like the main hub
home page if you will for your Wix
account and you can see we already have
a site that's kind of been built already
they have a builder called wicks Adi and
it will actually build a website for you
based on your preferences that you
choose up front I kind of let it go well
with that just to see what it would do
there are several different templates to
choose from different sites to link to
the Wix website there's a lot of things
you can do what will go through all
those in this video you can see right
now based on what the ad i just decided
to do randomly it's already built us a
website included templates included
background color schemes fonts things
like that so if you're just not willing
to put in the effort of making a website
kind of like the way you want it but you
just want to website up there then you
can choose the ad
builder and it will take care of
everything for you the only thing you
have to do is actually enter text like
relevant text that you want for the
website so obviously this has nothing to
do with Salazar studio just random
leaves and rain of them breaks head
going on so we're going to get rid of
all of this and we're going to build our
from scratch using the Wix editor so in
order to edit we're going to go to
editor right here you can ask you if you
want to leave the ADI interface you want
to make your own website then you have
to do that gain the cool thing if you
want supplements to this video which
says plenty of those available on
YouTube you can find some of those
linked in the video description if
you're interested although I hope that
this video will suffice at least get you
started get you on your feet ready to
make your own website with look as if
you're interested now the first thing I
notice about the Wix editor is that you
can manipulate even the smallest of
details with ease it's all very
accessible at your fingertips you don't
to worry about going through the mess
with html5 and the larger learning curve
that's associated with that especially
if you're first starting out in that my
brother had to go through that my
professor let me use wicks which was
awesome it was actually a technical
writing course and the website was
actually on thermodynamics believe it or
not which is our last video so I have
some experience with Wix and they've
actually improved it since then which is
nice to see so let's say I want to
change the Salazar's to do header right
here if I click on this group he receive
it everything explodes and now I can
customize the email address the phone
number all these different icons you can
move these around with the entire thing
around all that is very accessible if
you click again on a particular box
within that group then you can
manipulate that one box there you can
fly this all around the big deal they
also have these a little guidance boxes
to help you Center and align things
correctly so I've clicked on fellas our
studio and now I want to edit the text
so I can change the paragraph themes I
could change the fonts I can change you
know if I want bold or italicized the
alignment there's different effects
spacing it's all right here so I want to
make this a lot larger this is our
channel named after all and we can slide
this on over and if I want to Center it
I can all right there there we go and
centered and then let's change let's see
here trying to find a cool font that
one's a little too pizzazz II for my
taste pacifica condensed that looks
pretty dope make the font a little
larger there right now you can see we
have all this empty space down below
this tool right here what everything on
up there we go so I'm going to assume
that we are creating our website from
scratch so we're not going to have any
of this on here that way assuming that
you are starting with kind of a clean
slate you'll know where to find
everything if you're using this video as
a tutorial we don't want any of this now
the first thing i want to do because
this is for a youtube channel which is
where we're predominantly found then I
want to add a youtube link go over here
to social see we can add all these bars
there certain things for just facebook
also some for twitter they'll actually
update your twitter feeds on the Wix
website if you're interested in doing
something like that Tim yourself so this
is the Youtube subscriber bar this is
important obviously I want people to
subscribe if they're interested in and
doing that I want to make it as easy
form as possible so I can actually place
this check it out right there and then I
can set my channel control V and boom
there we go so now if you're signed into
a youtube account on your favorite
browser let's say google chrome all you
have to do to subscribe is click
Subscribe just like you would in the
YouTube web page now remember most
people know me from YouTube so I'm going
to try to link as much of YouTube as I
can into my website I'm gonna try to get
those as integrated as possible which
says all of that available here so I can
go up to let's get his video okay and
then I can choose to link a YouTube
video from my channel to a website and
then I all get to do is change video and
then add the video URL simple as that
let's see this nostalgia video is a good
one pretty much summarizes the entire
year and that's all going to do is share
control C bring it over here control V
update and boom there we go auto plays
on loading that's an option we can
definitely turn on that says that when
the web page loads the video will begin
playing automatically that's good for
views on my end it's also good for those
who are interested in getting in
and the channel helps them figure out
who we are and then the kind of content
that we produce and then check us out we
can get down to the nitty gritty with
editor we can choose to have the
controls for the video always-on screen
sort of pause played adjust the volume
adjust the resolution scrub all that
good stuff we can have that always set
or we can have it where you can never
change it which would kind of be
annoying for all of you or hover which
is kind of my preference so if you
really want to pause the video or you're
interested in something else then you
can just hover over the video window and
control it like that so that's very cool
we're going to make this kind of like
our introduction so we're going to put
this right over the top right when you
log into the channel you'll see that
intro video that's pretty awesome ok now
i do want to emphasize folks i'm not
going for like the best looking website
right now that would take several days
if not weeks to do i'm not too worried
about that right now what I do want is
an alternative web address for which
people can find our channel it's not
interested in doing it through YouTube
they can find this just set a
straight-up com website which should
increase traffic I want to check out the
app market which was not something I
took advantage of when I was in my
technical writing course they have a
facebook like pop up which will actually
pop up a little box kind of like an
advertisement but a little more subtle
than that let me add that app and then
we can link our Facebook page to this
box right here and click on settings and
then link our Facebook page click apply
and there we go you can see that's our
current light count we have 18,000
19,000 lights so now all people have to
do is click the like button and boom now
they're active on our Facebook page as
well as our YouTube page so two large
social media outlets for the channel are
now on our website and that's all thanks
to the Wix editor and all these built-in
social media bridges now something I've
just changed the background with black
it's now if you go up here to preview
you can see it's a moving background
concludes and even videos you can also
known as well I would say this is a
background that you'll that you'll get
with the one that I selected go back to
the editor here you'll see where I did
that a background toolbar top left and
then you can choose from any of these
electric darkness is one I chose ring
clouds floating particles deep sea waves
all of these are pre-loaded templates
into the Wix editor you can choose from
any of those in to reply it over the
entire web page background is of course
can be dragged down with ease so if you
have a web page that has a lot of
content you can always stretch it out no
big deal you know this one's a cool one
we rotating gears see how that was makes
it look all vintage oh I click publish
okay so I made a mistake learn from my
mistakes I accidentally click the
publish button set of a preview button
they're very very close to each other
right next to each other so I took the
wrong one to actually our website is
live now even though it's not finished
no big deal not like telling people to
go there right now but if you wanted
right now it's live so there's that
which also has several images that you
can choose from for your background all
of these are at your disposal I have
plenty of plenty of pictures to choose
from here actually it's going to take
quite a while to go through all of these
now the next part of the website
creation process is crucial for all of
you it's a big deal to me as well try
one included in this website that's a
forum for all of you to contribute to to
help other people out ask questions it's
something that I've been meaning to do
for a while and I'm glad that wakes has
come around and reached out to us
because this is a chance for us to
really explode our outreach to to those
who have questions so a lot of you who
consider yourselves tech-savvy will be
able to contribute and help those out
who I can't personally get to or who my
videos don't necessarily reach out to
now wicks has a built in forum creator a
forum engine of sorts we're going to use
that to create a forum for this website
so over to the add tab scroll down to
the Social section and you'll see way at
the bottom here Wix forum you open this
up we'll talk about how which has an
online forum creator and we're going to
use that will add that to our site there
we go and now we're on our forum page so
there's multiple pages on this website
and i'll be sure to include a navigation
link up top is what kind of move some
things around kind of getting more used
to the whole you know creative process
here there's a lot of things you can do
peace of mind you can right click and
you know you have your copy paste all
the typical things you'd have in another
editor you can also arrange bring
thanks to the front can throw in some
shapes you can throw backgrounds in all
that stuff is all here everything in the
ad section is a very easy to navigate
through very simple to do i'm not going
to go through each one of those because
it's pretty self-explanatory now the
form creation process will be a bit
tricky there will be things that will
need to add and maybe change later on
down the line I know there will be but
that's what I want all of you to to do
after you watch this video is a jump
onto the form contribute however you can
ask the question I kind of get the ball
rolling and then we'll see from there
where we need to change things all the
separate form page particularly for
things that you want to be fixed or
tweaked in the future so I can address
those you know point blank AC which
gives us an option to create categories
that will be crucial we can add a new
category let's call it let's see forum
revisions so this will be where you'll
go if you want to request some kind of
form-change you don't like the way it's
set up or it's difficult to navigate to
a particular topic then you can request
some kind of change to the categories or
the way it's laid out anything like that
all of those questions and requests
should go to the for revisions page we
have all these different settings down
here who can read its category everyone
or members only so obviously before
members only because you'll need to need
to be active in the forums in order to
request revisions and whatnot so a quick
description about the kind of where is
background color if you want it white
like it is there a text color will be
black member signup settings okay so it
can be a member everyone which option
shows up new member sign up fisting
member login it will do that one allow
social login probably google would be
okay now which has created a few forum
categories already we don't need these
discover they discover awesomeness you
guys already know where the awesomeness
is ok so we've got a very rudimentary
forum page set up and will kind of test
test that as we go but then you can if
you want to navigate to other pages on
your site or you want to create
additional pages I only have to do is
pop up to the top left here on the tool
bar next to the Wix icon and then you
can see you can add pages down at the
ball
then we can also create sub pages for
certain pages that you can only navigate
to if you go to the umbrella page if you
will but we don't need the blog page
you're not really interested in doing
that I guess that's kind of what my
videos for the shop I'll leave that up
but I don't have any merchandise yet so
when we start pumping out merchandise I
will link all of that to the website so
if you want to buy something in the
future all you guys know about that
probably in a forum post and in a video
on YouTube then this is where you'll go
to buy that merchandise via the shop I
guess page in our website so I'm going
to do a few more things with the form
design this is a huge part of the
website I expect it'll be the largest
part that's what most of your going to
come here for so I'm going to take my
time here and make sure that I add as
many categories as I can try to get us
as specific as i can because i'm going
to be really difficult to find the exact
category looking for if I may make a
category for graphics card questions
maybe pc troubleshooting questions cpu
selection things like that maybe a
really great deals that you happen to
find will have a category for that those
are all things that I hope that you guys
will contribute to in the form revisions
page and then also in this video's
comments if you have some suggestions
for future categories leave those as
well and i'll be sure to add those as
quickly as possible so another thing
when you first navigate to the forum
page you'll see this right here and then
you'll be able to click on the category
you want i might add a tool bar up top
as well or something like a side panel a
little you know side navigation bar that
way you can find the topic you're
looking for quickly but this is the
first thing that you'll see and we'll be
able to edit the content here by going
to categories and then clicking edit
over the main page and then we can
change the form description as we please
I also don't forget after you done
anything major on the website go up here
to the top right click say that'll save
your current progress you can always log
out and log back in and start up where
you left off and then also if you're
very content with what you have so far
with the publish button and that will
make the website and go live as it is so
if you navigated to this site let's just
do it right now www tell us our studio
YT
we should see the website as it was the
New Year's well as it was when we left
it off and click publish oh okay yeah i
just realized that I don't have I don't
have any navigation bar so that's
something we need to do now the way that
it's set up right now I've just attached
to the navigation bar which was as
simple as going to review to add and
then clicking menu and then dragging
this over to the header so no matter
where you go the header is always going
to be there you'll be able to navigate
from page to page I included some
shadows change the colors and fonts of
it it's all very self-explanatory but if
you notice the way that I have it set up
now whenever I scroll down the header
stays up top no matter what it doesn't
go away it kind of overlaps whatever i'm
scrolling behind it with so the way i
change that if i go back here too i
click on the header box and then click
settings i can change it to where the
header won't freeze so all i need to do
click Save again and if we go back and
preview now when I scroll the header
scrolls with it which is much better
especially perform just want to look at
multiple lines up and down the header is
not going to cut any of that off I'll
get yours navigate up top again to click
on the page that you want you can see
right now how it's shifting transition
wise and it looks a little looks looks
pretty bad the new years so I'm going to
go back and I go to pages page
transitions and we're just going to say
none okay so what I've done after
revising the forums for a few minutes
just getting feedback from those of you
on Twitter I've changed the font type of
change the way a few of the things
looking so this is so this is a live web
site right now on the forum when you
sign up you can create your own profile
so you see I've got mine here I've got
followers and go show that I'm gonna
it's like the admin crown or something
you can change like you're here I guess
border background whatever you want to
call that yeah there's a lot of
different things that you can do just
within the forum section of Wix that
wasn't something that I believe they had
before I think they've added that
recently but that changes the game big
time for channel like myself if you have
something like this that you'd like to
grow or you know extend or branch out to
a different community then you can do
that with Wix and your own website
creating a
is a huge way to interact with your fan
base now another big part of the entire
wicks editing experience is the mobile
side of things so instead of logging
into the website from desktop or laptop
the mobile version of the website can
look completely different with the Wix
editor that's something that I find very
cool it's about half the traffic to just
the youtube channel loan it's through
mobile so we definitely want to make
this look as good as we possibly can in
the mobile format so that people are
encouraged to actually check it out and
not want to you know wait till they get
home so I think on the mobile side of
things we're going to make this fairly
simple I don't want it to be too complex
and too busy because frankly nobody has
time for that and I'm not looking to
make this experience complicated
obviously so you can see as you scroll
down it'll actually show you what it
will look like on a mobile device which
is very cool so you know exactly what
you're going to get on the mobile device
before you publish it which means that
you can revise as many times you need to
beforehand that's cool get a back to top
button and what people can navigate from
page to page if they so please that's
nice to have I think I'll throw that up
there if I get some negative feedback
i'll take it back off i'm not exactly
sure how that's going to look but ok so
then mobile you again gives your
visitors the best user experience and
smaller screen so you can choose to
allow them to see just the desktop view
or you can set a mobile-friendly version
that's what we're just talking about you
can make it look totally different on
the mobile side of things which is very
cool helps you reach out to that other
half of your fanbase one of you that
subscriber button up there that's kind
of an important part about what I do
subscriptions obviously matter save that
publish that okay so now i'm going to
hop on to to the website via my phone
and we're going to see how this looks oh
wow a lot of people are contributing to
the forms already that is nice I want
this to be like a thing you know like
you have our own community apart from
just what we do on YouTube and Twitter
so it's very cool thank you guys for
interacting already but I can confirm
that everything does look exactly the
same on my phone as it does on the
virtual phone in the Wix editor so
something that I don't know how to do
business is just an example if you have
that I have an answer in this video
another tons they go through but most of
it is fairly navigable this is a very
simple user interface that's something I
congratulate wakes on but if there is
something that you aren't sure how to do
for example now when I go to the
Salazar's to do website I have the site
bookmarked right here but I don't have
what they call a favicon or whatever
power you proud of it but it's a small
icon that appears next to a bookmark
page or when you're actually on that
website so there's a way to do that and
which has just a dedicated page just for
how to set that up so the first thing we
do is access our site manager so we're
going to go to site manager and then the
next thing we need to do click on domain
and an upload favicon so okay domain and
then they become there it is right there
we can create our own science to do if
image please it'll do that go ahead and
refresh the page welcome to the new year
it is so our favicon is that's pretty
awesome so now we have our own icon for
the channel that's the Salazar's studio
logo very awesome this guy was asking
about it someone go and tell him six
sweet so now anytime you're on the page
you don't even have to bookmark it
although i do suggest that you do even
if it's not you'll still see the page
icon on the on that pages tool bar up
top especially if you're in chrome or
firefox something like that so super
cool if you have any other questions
that do have wix's help page down below
you can pretty much find any answer to
any question you have but this video is
just kind of like an introduction we
created our page for some of our studio
that's a big step for us and something
I've been holding off on because I
didn't think the time was right yet but
now we're getting to the point where I
can't answer as many questions in the
East to and youtube comments and on
Twitter and on Facebook we have a
dedicated forum now specifically for
your questions concerns and just you
know you have anything cool that you
want to post you can certainly do that
as well it's going to be very chill laid
back for I'm not going to be no stickler
with what's posted where but I might
have a few moderators to kind of sort
things out later on I don't know how to
do that right now they'll figure that
out later but I think for how much
effort we put into this in just a few
hours or it's been you know I started
like 2pm I started filming it
630pm now so in four hours we've
produced a viable website with the Wix
editor and that's something that caught
a lot of website creators can say they
have an interface that's so easy to use
it's just so seamless and and very easy
to navigate through that you can create
a website in just a few hours that's
ultimately there's just of Wix that's
what they they seek to do is give you an
open platform it's very easy to to use
to create the website of your dreams
well that was really cheesy which we're
going to watch this video he really he
really just say that anyway they wanted
me to promote wicks because they know
how simple it is to use even though a
lot of you guys are tech-savvy or would
consider yourselves you know not
computer amateurs or moobs they still
believe that a simple interface is the
best interface and you definitely get
that vibe when you use the Wix editor
obviously check out the links in the
video description create your free
website with Wix today I don't think
you'll be disappointed I mean hey it's
free if you don't like it don't use it
you're not losing any money but if you
do like it which I do think you will
then maybe you'll want to purchase a
month by month premium plan or a yearly
premium plan so you get access to an
even wider range of features a lot of
which were featured in this tutorial
here by the way as a disclaimer I'm not
of any sort of commission with Wix I
don't get paid if you sign up for a
premium plan or even a free plan there's
no stress there on my end it I'm only
telling you to do what I did to create
this website because i do think you'll
enjoy the experience even if all you do
is create a free website i still think
you'll enjoy the wide which is made it
very simple that's kind of the point if
you like this video be sure to give it a
thumbs up be sure to check out the links

questions in the youtube comments
