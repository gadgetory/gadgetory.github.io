have been wondering why I haven't been
so active with Intel lately I haven't
talked much about the X 299 chipset the
LGA 2066 socket it's because for 99% of
you that entire platform is stupid it's
a prime example of intel's misguided and
ill-informed marketing strategy intended
to redirect your attention from the red
team we've seen this ploy time and time
again and not just with a PC tech
industry do not be fooled what you're
looking at here is almost an exact
replica of the i7 7700 K yes folks this
is the i7 77 40 X behold it's nothing
different
stay away the specs one I've been almost
every way save oh here we go
a whopping point one gigahertz base
frequency bump are you freakin kidding
me you also can only run up two dual
channel Macs in the CPU even though it's
required X 299 motherboard has slots for
8 modules in quad-channel
so four of those will have to be blank
unless you want to put stuff there just
for show
this list continues by the way into even
more pathetic territory
brace yourselves I'm about to unleash on
the blue team and it's about time let's
ignore all of what we've heard regarding
the X 299 platform to date even the
reviews the benchmarks at this point
clear your head close your eyes and
listen to these ridiculous facts I'm
about to save you a bunch of money the
first of these that Intel decided this
time around to cut into your PCIe lanes
across the board with the exception of
the $1,000 chip if you want an 8 core 16
threaten thews iasts processor good for
you you're only going to get 28 PCIe
lanes actually a downgrade from the 59
60 X in 69 hundred K counterparts what
sense if any does it make City
enthusiasts consumer now I'm saying that
on purpose because that's the 1% here
you are more than likely in the 99% Club
which means that you won't be able to
fully utilize or getting we're close to
full utilizing the 8 cores 16 threads 10
cores 20 threads available in these
higher tiered CPUs that are going to
cost upwards of a thousand bucks it's
just a fact even I don't utilize that
much is why I'm scoring at 6700 K in my
daily editing rig I don't need anything
more than that chances are you don't
either and even if you could find an
excuse for those 4 cores or 8 cores and
then enthusiast X $2.99 platform you
have other options that are much cheaper
frankly
ninety-seven z170 izzy 270x 370 be 350
risin is a compelling offer now sure the
x2 99 eight core sixteen thread CPU here
is only priced at five ninety-nine which
is a considerable bump down from the 59
60 I can 16 under case prices which are
still roughly at a thousand the US so
the prices come down but that's not the
point here price is not the issue when
it comes to enthusiast grade CPUs it's
what you get for that price if you're
going to pay 600 bucks
well you better expect some compromises
but then why are you even considering X
299 in the first place if you're going
to expect those compromises you want the
full 40 44 PCIe lanes you have to buy
the most expensive processor in the
current lineup and that's a bit
ridiculous if you ask me the 78 20 X
here has literally taken an arrow to the
need regardless of the fact that most
graphics cards run on eight lanes just
as well as 16 pairing 3 or 4 of anything
becomes well pointless and isn't that
the point of an enthusiast platform to
have that upgrade option available
consider MDOT to raise and 10 Gigabit
Ethernet as well and since Intel sets
this platform up to last at least three
or four years the idea of future
proofing for potential Vega and voltic
cards for example which may require the
full 16 lanes each goes completely out
the window look in terms of gaming about
the only people who should be
considering the X 299 platform are those
who are going to pair 3 or 4 graphics
cards into the same rig now they can't
do that with Pascal but they can do that
with Maxwell they can do that with
crossfire configurations on AMD side so
it kind of makes sense to have those
extra PCIe lanes there because you will
at some point utilizes you can do eight
eight eight eight and still be
completely in the green with 44 PCIe
lanes but you have to spend a thousand
bucks to even get that in the first
place so what the heck is going on
Intel's giving you the finger want the
lanes pay up I was so surprised when I
saw the lane counts I was really
disappointed but on from that even the
motherboards themselves are going to be
extremely expensive expect to pay around
300 bucks if not more for a motherboard
just to put your CPU in for the sex
$2.99 platform now that's not surprising
itself x-series lineups have always been
expensive so we have the x79 boards the
x99 boards and now the x-29 boards and
they've all been around the same prices
anywhere between 250 and maybe 600 bucks
they can get very expensive but here's
the issue I have with with the board
prices and something like an i7 77 40 X
if you're paying more for your
motherboard than you are for your CPU
something is not right in fact it's just
downright ridiculous and how you know
you're not PC incorrectly like why do
these two even exist like why even
bother because Intel's banking on your
sale
hopefully this stops you and your
tracked especially for these two here
like why the hell is a four core for
that CPU even in its mix I'm trying to
do you a favor here by the way I'm not
trying to just bash on Intel the point
of this video is to save you money and
to save you from a product that
ultimately isn't worth your money and if
you notice I'm not even really
discussing X 299 applications they won't
really apply to most of you watching but
I can say that safely I try to talk a
friend out of X 299 a few days ago he
was so into it so sold on the product
from a marketing standpoint that I
really couldn't convince him to eat the
small IPC drop in favor of Rison 7 I
said look if you want eight cores and 16
threads go Rising seven save yourself at
least 500 bucks sure optimizations tend
to tilt at least at this point in time
in favor of the blue team but maybes
come a long way and they offer
compelling price points and for 99% of
you made cores is more than enough for
your daily computing needs so it sounds
tempting I get it I purchased a thousand
dollar CPU and fell right into that trap
I realized that well the extra four
cores really weren't doing me much good
in anything that I was working on daily
just for the channel or on social media
or what-have-you
I even do a bunch of blender tests and
stuff and I just didn't find the extra
money the $700 into that CPU and the
more expensive motherboard worth it and
I have a feeling that most of you will
feel the same way so save yourself the
trouble just don't bother in the first
place the truth is most programs fall
well short of max thread utilization the
law of diminishing returns becomes more
evident when more money is on the table
so save it
stick with z97 z170 z 270 be 350 X 370
those are all viable platforms and this
current point in time all viable
chipsets and you will not notice a huge
performance cut you'll save a heck a lot
of money by the way in the process but
for those of you who do think that you
will reap the benefits of X 299 I keep
getting all the X's and Z's and all it
confused I'm not saying you shouldn't
buy it I mean if you know you're going
to utilize the threads you know you
really like the horsepower you need a
new platform a beer on x79 right now and
you want something new and
or then the platform is still viable for
you I get it I'm not saying that for the
one percent or so of you that do utilize
those resources you shouldn't buy it I
think it's still decent I just think it
doesn't really appeal to most of us and
that's what this video is intended to do
to warn most of you to not fall into
this marketing ploy with that if you
like my sunburn or like the video be
sure to give this one a thumbs up thumbs
down for the opposite or if you hate
everything about life be sure to please
subscribe and if you haven't already
stay tuned for the next video here on
the channel announce the giveaway winner
by the way of the rx 580 in the next
video which will be uploaded tomorrow
night I presume this is a science to do
