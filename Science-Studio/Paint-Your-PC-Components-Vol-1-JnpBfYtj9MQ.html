studio so a lot of you are probably
familiar with my own personal rig I've
uploaded a few videos to YouTube already
detailing the parts that kind of
comprise the thing you probably know
that it's powered by the modest intel
skylake i 360 100 overclocked to 4.2
gigahertz
I'm also sporting a gigabyte win force
r9 380 4 gigabyte graphics card and two
sticks of ddr4 clocked at 26 66
megahertz if you are wondering how we
managed to overclock my locked core i3
check out the link in the video
description now don't get me wrong I
love everything about this system its
speed its reliability its functionality
and perhaps most importantly its price
but there was something just eating at
me and it's probably obvious to you at
this point
what that thing is the insanely clashing
color scheme I wanted to fix that so I
decided to disassemble my entire PC and
painted using white Plasti Dip yeah are
you ready
alright let's get down to business
I began of course by removing the front
and back panels of my NZXT s340 computer
case all of the cables wired directly
into the motherboard and graphics card
were removed including the eight pin GPU
power connector a pin CPU power
connector which proved to be a bit
tricky given the hyper T for extended
reach problem and the 24 pin motherboard
power connector SATA cables
fan cables and the USB 3.0 hub cable
were also obviously disconnected we
remove the graphics card next notably
before disconnecting all the tiny case
cables down below we lifted the lever on
the PCI port and pulled the graphics
card
out now with a quick inspection I
concluded that I would probably paint
both the front and back plates of the
card the fans however would remain
unpainted simply for the sake of
stability also I'm not sure how it's
going to look being completely white I
made sure to remove my additional PCI
components including my Wi-Fi adapter
and NZXT LED card the SSD was next
maybe I'll paint this and through the
EVGA power supply from the tower in the
following step the four screws held the
PSU frame to the back of the case be
very gentle when sliding all the cables
out of your case I pulled down the NZXT
LED light string from the inside of the
case this is what gave my case the blue
glow and then I moved on to the rear
mounted exhaust fan four screws of
course and then slide it right out on a
side note I sincerely hope that all of
you enjoy the game of boggle no boggle
is not our sponsor be sure that your
motherboard is completely disconnected
from any foreign objects before turning
your computer on its side we located the
fiber so screws holding it in place and
use a magnetic phillips head screwdriver
to unmount the bore itself
look how handy that is Otto lost that
screw a while back I carefully remove
the mobo if this sounds weird
Mobe oh yeah I don't like that using the
t4 as a handle of sorts and placed it on
a textbook of all things okay so from
this point on you'll need to put on your
big boy pants and your big girl pants
things are about to get dicey if at any
point you get uncomfortable assuming
you're following along with us please
make a u-turn and save yourself the
stress and potential hardware damage
this is risky business hmm I think I'll
just paint this part
yeah the 24 pin connector
okay so turn your motherboard on its
side and locate the screws holding your
vom heatsinks in place some motherboards
have the screws entering from the top
versus the bottom now in case you're
wondering vrm stands for voltage
regulator modules the sockets under
these heat sinks convert your PS use
input voltages typically 5 volts and 12
volts into much lower streams of voltage
to power your processor you should
remove a heatsink
over your chipset as well now if you
haven't already removed your RAM cards
we plan to paint ours though we had no
idea what it was installed for us with
these to our pan Ram dims looked like
they'd be mighty difficult to
disassemble and they were it took me
literally an hour to figure out how
these things open there were no screws
and there were no levers or handles or
anything of that sort apparently the two
heat shields over the memory modules
themselves were glued to the spreader so
finally once I realized that this would
take some careful precise forced upon
things open I downgraded to a flathead
screwdriver size and pried them open
basically you know what I had to do it
I'm open the experience was a bit like
shucking an oyster you've ever done that
it's kind of the only
I can think of this point once inside
the beautiful memory modules were
revealed now the second half of the heat
spreader the other half of it that was
kind of stuck to the circuit itself
simply refused to budge when I finally
decided that the costs outweigh the
benefits on this one I concluded that I
would just have to place painters tape
over the circuits themselves to prepare
for the paint process so that's exactly
what I did
don't press too firmly when performing
this stuff you really don't want to snag
on resistors when removing this tape
later on which you have to do I decided
to paint the SSD as well just for kicks
I really didn't know how it would turn
out so I taped off the important parts
for good measure now as for the SSD tray
this thing would be super easy to paint
no tape required okay now on to the
graphics card I knew from the start that
this thing would prove the most
difficult and yes I mean even more so
than Ram these screws had to come off
first at least that's what I thought
when all of them were removed I found
that there were other screws holding the
back plate in from the opposite side it
would have to come off later so I turned
the card front side up and began
unscrewing the fan brackets from the
heatsink below and yes the screws were
located in the side of the fan and links
themselves and yes I needed a smaller
screwdriver and
I had to unscrew the screws at an angle
man there were screws on the sides and
front of the card as well some were very
tricky to get at one was behind a heat
pipe I have no idea how they expected
anyone to unscrew that let alone screw
that into the first place
the wind force card had three plugs that
needed to be removed to smaller plugs
for the LED front panel and then one
large plug for the dual fan array the
PCB itself was elaborate and impressive
of course but the pre applied thermal
paste was not it was sticky and just
poorly applied it was kind of just
splashed all over the GPU cheap really
but no surprise there a lot of companies
tend to budget on this sort of thing so
we'll fix that in a later step
disconnect the heatsink from the top of
the card and take a picture of what's
left
he'll need this during the rewiring
phases of the reassembling process
apparently this card only assembles if
the fan and LED cables are arranged a
specific way we pulled out the wind
force LED panel and realized that all we
had remaining was an intricate piece of
plastic literally it was just plastic so
we could basically paint this entire
thing we paused for a second at this
point and realized just how far we'd
come pretty much everything that we
wanted was it ready to be painted so
after masking off a few important parts
on each component we brought them all
outside our graphics card front and back
plates were ready to go our vrm and chip
setting things were ready to go
our RAM was ready to go our SSD was also
ready to go and our hyper key for a fan
bracket which I didn't show being
disassembled because it was literally
just four screws was also in the game
oh and I don't forget our SSD mounting
trip we also tried to paint some SATA
cables just for kicks but I really
regretted that I prepared a canvas of
sorts using old new egg cardboard boxes
hello the cardboard boxes you use don't
have to be from new egg prepared our
Plasti Dip by shaking the can vigorously
for a minute or so yes we follow
directions and then brought over our
components began applying gentle yet the
row coats I know that's really confusing
it was for us too I'm no expert at this
so please don't completely trash me in
the comments below I will appreciate it
the instructions on the can said to
spray from around six to ten inches away
from the target but I found this tactic
led to overspray in some cases so if you
are a plasti dipping pro maybe you
figured out how to master the art by now
and maybe you can step into the studio
and show the rest of us how it's done
like for real though if you are a
plaster dipping pro you are welcome to
be featured in a future video just kind
of you know hit us up
okay so it looks like this code is good
and finish it's not super thick yet but
I do expect that as we continue to add
coach to this it'll thicken and kind of
look a little Madi maybe even glossy I'm
not sure how this will look on the
materials that we're painting on but
that's what this is all about just
figuring this out so I'm gonna swap
these out for the other parts that we
haven't painted it and then we'll let
them dry should get a good little
circuit going should not the wait too
long between sex so let's go and do that
after three or so coats the vibrancy of
the white plastidip started to show I
was very impressed with the looks this
early into the painting process well ok
impressed with it all - the SATA cables
obviously
we just had a few more coats
once the paint dried our first set of
goodies I decided to test drive one of
the components I replaced the second
black SSD tray which I hadn't painted
yet with our newly painted white one and
was very satisfied with the new dynamic
that was beginning to unfold once the
paint dried on the rest of our goodies I
brought them back inside and brace
myself for the reassembling phase of the
project since I knew the graphics card
would prove the most difficult I decided
to tackle it first at least partially at
this point however it obviously doesn't
matter what you choose to start with the
wind force logo popped into place the
fans and their cables were routed
successfully and then we're screwed back
onto their respective brackets I
double-check that each fan spun
unhindered just to be sure
with both fans in place I was already
feeling the jitters this thing was
already looking pretty sweet I have to
say I was actually glad that I decided
not to paint the fans the contrast it
works for me moving on we reinstall the
vrm and chipset heat sinks but in order
to hold them into place
they were quite stubborn I had to get a
bit creative for parts of the step I
basically had to let the board lean
partially over a table and lay
underneath it to screw the vrm heat
sinks particularly it felt a bit like
working on a car from you know below oh
and our pop kept getting in the way once
the board was reassembled I gave it a
few turns to you know verify that the
board did in fact look pretty sweet and
it did next
I peeled the painters tape off of the
RAM sticks being especially careful over
the circuits themselves they actually
turned out better than I expected the
paint was actually glossy looking in the
places with rough textures which I
didn't expect at all and all in all
looked almost like that was how they
were purchased in the first place which
was obviously the goal here the two
halves of each card connected very
simply much simpler than they
disconnected I made sure to apply force
over the two plates once they were
together again all to ensure that the
six would in fact stay together once
they were in the board in all
seriousness though I could not believe
how great these sticks turned out I was
very proud of myself at this point
we merged our motherboard with our tower
I love that word merged after
reinserting a ram and then realized that
our color conversion was starting to
finally take shape as a whole that was
my watch
things actually matched after realizing
that I had mentally given up on the
graphics card reassembly stage just kind
of transitioned from that for some
reason I jumped back onto it I remounted
the backplate to the PCB of the card
itself and then secured it with the
original screws now after using ninety
whatever percent isopropyl alcohol to
clean the original thermal paste from
the GPU and heat spreader I applied some
of our leftover Arctic silver 5 whatever
thermal compound to the chip dabbing
slightly more than the typical amount
for CPU make sure that at this point the
alignment between your heat spreader and
the circuit board is very near perfect
don't allow your thermal glue to come
into contact with other components it's
unlikely that anything would come to
harm but you never know
now once the heatsink was aligned I
quickly secured it from the back of the
card through the back plate I'm talking
about the four screws mounted in the
square pattern it would be better if you
had someone else hold the heatsink in
place while performing this step I found
that my heatsink was slippery bit and
kind of slid around over the GPU as I
tried to hold it steady
we brought over the front plate is that
what you call it a front plate I don't
even know whatever it's the front plate
and reinstalled it in this step now be
sure to plug in your cables before
screwing the front plate onto the board
itself when the card was finally
assembled to completion we stopped to
admire it for a few seconds
back from that reinsert your graphics
card into your motherboard at this point
securing it to the frame as well now at
this point I like to wire all of my case
components to the motherboard first I do
this particularly because it becomes
difficult to weave those thin cables in
between the massive ones of the power
supply once it's inserted so connect the
hard drive LED power LED power button HD
audio USB cables etc etc into the board
first now grab a hold of your power
supply and Raddatz cables through your
case as we did here yes it is a pain but
every computer builder must go through
this process unless you have a modular
power supply I guess that wouldn't be
such a bad thing unless you're you know
really tight on cash which is
understandable
we secured it to our tower using the
included mounting bracket and the four
screws so unfortunately though as
expected our SSDs paintjob was a bit
rustic but the good thing is that
plastidip is removable yeah you heard
that correctly as long as you spray the
paint in thick enough coats it'll
basically peel right off okay so back to
reassembling once your power and SATA
cables have been routed and plugged in
appropriately and preferably in the same
ports that they were plugged into
originally yeah I'm going to cover that
part up no one wants to see that mess
right am i right but hey the rest looks
alright give the computer one last
tribute and admire the work you've so
devoutly invested into your newly
decorated build pop on the front and
back panels plugging the important
peripherals and okay so this is the
moment of truth plug everything in we're
about to turn it on hopefully it turns
on
hopefully okay
yeah
right
not bad not bad check it out I am so
pleased with these looks
I really wish all of you could see it in
person but don't worry I'll show better
footage of it in a sec I've recorded
this with my phone because I was so
eager to see it turn on and light up
that I didn't actually bring my DSLR
with me the blue LEDs definitely bring
the white in the case to life I'm very
glad I went with this color scheme okay
so after practically performing surgery
on my PC it works I was more worried
about it working than anything else but
nonetheless it is working and it looks
stunning at least in my opinion
now this isn't perfect and using Plasti
Dip
isn't going to give you a perfect
solution especially if you're looking
for glossy finish
but given the four dollars that I paid
for the paint and the six or so hours
that it took to paint everything with
multiple coats I'd say it looks pretty
good for the amount of time and money
invested now if why it's not your color
by all means choose another color black
they have red green some kind of like
neon yellow and there are plenty of
colors out there to choose so if you
decide to Plasti Dip any part of your
computer just you know choose something
that goes along with the rest of your
build and preferably with your case as
well so in my case well literally you
could see that I had some color disarray
in there I had copper orange colors
mixed with red colors mixed with black
and white and blue it was just it was
just kind of a mess so what I decided to
do was paint over everything that had
any color other than white or black for
the most part I mean there are some
things that you really can't change so
all of the vrm heat Singh's are white
the heatsink over the z170 chipset is
white pretty much the entire graphics
card the most part is white and the case
is white that's cool I also kind of did
a terrible job on painting my 24 pin
power connector you might want to find a
different kind of paint to use for the
that mine looks a bit chalky but I'm not
going to be moving it or unplugging it
too often so it's it's it's like a
two-foot mod and then maybe a one-foot
mod in some cases it's definitely not a
ten-foot mod from from where I'm sitting
you really can't see that there's any
kind of painting malpractice going on in
there so if you're looking to show off
your PC to your friend's girlfriend
boyfriend etc they're not going to be
too picky about the details they're
gonna look at it from well pretty much
how far away I am from it right now and
they're gonna say wow that is an awesome
paint job hopefully they say that I mean
if you do anywhere near as okay of a job
as I did you're in the clear so I'm not
saying that you have to paint your
computer parts obviously and please do
these things carefully all this is at
your own risk
keep that in mind everything that you
decide to do to your computer is at your
own risk
and once you paint these things and take
off the stickers and whatnot most of
your warranties are void I did notice it
on the RAM in particular I pulled off
the sticker and it left a void pattern
like engraved into the metal and is that
was a pain to get rid of but uh yeah
there aren't any stickers left on my RAM
sticks and that's going to be a problem
if I ever want to return them but of
course that was something I considered
before I decided to paint this entire
system so keep that in mind with every
part not just your RAM but with every
part of your system that you plan on
painting it's very likely you won't be
able to return anything that you paint
over so with that in mind I'll go ahead
and show you a few last-minute clips of
the system and then I guess you can
decide for yourself if you want to spend
the time and little bit of money to
paint your system and make it your own
so that's about it everyone I appreciate
the interest thanks for watching this
far into the video leave a like if you
thought the video was cool leave a dis
dislike if you thought the video was
crap and you're certainly entitled to
feel that way if you would like to leave
a comment please do so I try to answer
as many of them as I can and as always
be sure to subscribe for more I guess
I'll just kind of
include the video with a few more clips
of the PC that I painted Phil yeah it's
a sign studio thanks for learning
