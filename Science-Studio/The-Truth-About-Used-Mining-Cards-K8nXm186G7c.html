outside some of you here's something
weird I'm gonna blame mother nature this
is a question a few others in YouTube
have tried to answer in the past and I
understand why it keeps coming up
because there's really no solid answer
should you buy a graphics card you
suspect was used for mining we've got
several variables to consider and I'm
gonna cut straight to the point in this
video
so the first thing you need to do is
look at a graphics card like a mini
computer we've got the GPU essentially a
small motherboard underneath soldered
Ram a dedicated cooling system rear i/o
and ports on both power and data
transfer all of this results in I've
been a pretty expensive card you could
spend anywhere from like 10 bucks to
$10,000 on one in the new market but
cards depreciate pretty fast and a lot
of this is tied to the fact that people
don't trust used hardware especially
used graphics cards especially if they
were used for mining I mean can I blame
you you got no idea how the card was
treated was it casually gaming or 24/7
mining what all should you consider when
you target the use market and come
across a card that looks super suspect
if you think it was used for mining
here's what I advise you do first make
sure you're shopping on trustworthy
websites I recommend eBay for starters
that's just a good place to get familiar
with the buying and selling of
components by our protection guarantee
on eBay is definitely a good thing it's
saving more than once
Amazon's also pretty ok as is Newegg but
the problem with these sites is that you
can't verify the integrity of anything
so the card could have got awful coil
line a fan could be dead more on that
later it could also be running super hot
and that would be super out of the
ordinary so you're taking a risk every
purchase comes with a bit of that but
used components especially that's why
people keep the tinfoil hats on and
again I don't really blame you it's your
money you choose how to spend it but you
know only websites that publicize a
strong money-back guarantee are the ones
I would dabble with the exception of
this is like a site similar to
Craigslist where you'd actually get to
meet the seller in person and possibly
inspect the component firsthand just
make sure you're extra careful and bring
a friend if you absolutely need to go
inside someone's house which is probably
what you'll have to do if your goal is
to see the card working right in a
system before buying it's just it's kind
of sketchy when it gets personal now
let's throw out a hypothetical let's say
you meet this person in an office and
notice they've got a mining farm pimped
out in the closet and the car Dee's
trying to sell you is identical to the
ones running in that closet yes start
sweating right you don't want to be
awkward and leave without asking
questions so understandably you pop the
question was this card used for mining
there's really no way you'll know unless
they confess or you see it pulled from
the farm firsthand
and this is the case with online sellers
as well right it's one gamble so if you
can verify that the card works then
you're off to a good start and that's
obviously I think the first concern
people have when they buy used my next
recommended course of action would be to
tear the card apart especially if the
card several years old and out of
warranty a lot of Pasco cards come with
three year warranties which means buying
them used at this point may mean you
won't be able to send it in for repair
free of charge this is another aspect of
the use market of which the buyer should
be aware not too many people talk about
it but it is something you should
consider if the warrant is void I
encourage you to disassemble it if it's
not for anything else other than that
replace the GPS thermal compound it
probably needs a replacement after about
two or three years you can also take
this opportunity to remove dust and
ensure that thermal pads are present and
in good condition if you notice any
bulging caps or leaky resistors this may
be a sign that the board is on the brink
of failure and it's been running very
hot for very long amounts of time you'll
never really know until it happens again
you just kind of kind of prepare for
these things I researched far and wide
and across dozens of forums I came to
the conclusion that graphics card fans
probably fail more than anything else
and it kind of makes sense I mean
they're really the only moving parts of
the entire graphics card system and are
stressed beyond belief when things get
toasty as such I advise only buying used
cards whose fans are easily replaceable
many so tech fans for example can be
found here on Amazon on the cheap these
here asus strix fans a bit more
expensive but get the point so it all
comes down to what you think will be
easier to replace in the long run I
don't have a huge sample size from which
to draw any serious conclusions here and
I mean there be there's so much data out
there to even gather and form a
conclusion around so I'd be willing to
bet though a majority of mining cards
will see their fans fail before anything
else which is a good thing if you're
willing to take the risk and make the
quick swap also a lot of miners will
just run the fans at 100% rpm the entire
time the cards are mining just to make
sure that the cards stay cool and
another thing miners have been known to
undervolt to their cards to maximize
margin since mining is resource
intensive and requires large amounts of
power over long amounts of time many
will choose to undervolt by say 10% and
reap the benefits of only a 5% reduction
and effective hashing it's just an
example but hopefully
point so despite many of these mining
cards running 24/7 or at least
cyclically right many of them are
running more efficiently as a result and
don't reach those toasty 100 degrees
Celsius t-junctions as often as you
might think
that in most modern carts throttle
themselves anyway so I wouldn't be too
worried about the cars overheating
unless the room is horribly ventilated
or something but even then the cards
would still probably shut off the whole
system would shut off before anything
overheated on a relatively new card so
you can imagine a car let's say running
on cruise control for several days apart
from stopping for gas which is the
obvious nothing about such a journey
should be too taxing for the car I mean
mpg is usually pretty good on the
highway temperatures are usually in
check because you're just running it one
or two thousand rpm or maybe not 1000
rpms but you know it's a steady just
approach to travel and that's kind of
how I think about mining it's probably
doing it more justice than it deserves
but mining is like cruise control for
graphics cards I mean yeah they're
running 24/7 and they're working pretty
hard but if they're under volted and the
fan curves are ramped all the way up
these cards aren't getting very hot and
I don't really see too much wrong with
that and the grand scheme of things
unless of course they've been running
for 10 years straight at which point
yeah avoid that thing and like we said
earlier people ramp up fan speeds and
undervolt which means that the lifespan
of the card is actually increased by
quite a bit now on the contrary car is
used for gaming are like cars that only
run in the city they stop and go a lot
and often accelerate quickly to attain
desired speeds in the short amount of
time they have worst mpg they get very
hot quickly and then cool down just as
fast because it's stop go stop go I know
this isn't a perfect analogy but I hope
it gets you thinking about the
differences in usage right I mean
graphics cards used for gaming are
idling or they're being used pretty hard
and they're reaching I mean temperatures
usually that require the cards to
throttle their own frequencies so you
can look at that
multiple ways but like I said I just
want you to think about it I'm really
indifferent to this idea that mining
makes cards perform worse in the long
run or decreases the lifespan
dramatically cards don't just randomly
die usually like I said it's a fan or
something along those lines how many
GPUs do you know just stop working like
the GPUs or CPUs for that matter so I
think there are other aspects of the
board to take into consideration not
necessarily most expensive component and
if you send this in and let's see it's
an msi card msi is pretty good usually
about their RMA processes and we'll even
honor warranties outside of their two or
three-year periods they may charge you I
don't know 40 bucks to replace a couple
fans or to replace a few caps on the
board usually it's not the entire board
of the GPU itself that needs to be
replaced I totally understand if that's
nothing you want to deal with right you
just want peace of mind you want to buy
new I get it but for the people who are
on the fence about buying used this is
stuff you should consider and to TYIN in
my last point you got to feel out the
seller who you're buying from and what I
mean by that is this he or she is
forthcoming right honest appears genuine
overall you probably don't have too much
to worry about that was a huge gust of
wind even if the card was mined with so
this will be easier to do when dealing
in person obviously but you can still
manage online ask questions you may let
you do that you can gauge answers by
their tones points of hesitation word
choices I mean it's your job right to
ask these questions you're the buyer
this is due diligence this is the
definition of it before you commit
you've got a question if you don't and
you also fail to inspect the card either
prior to purchase or immediately after
receiving it's your own fault that's why
many websites promote 714 or 30-day
return policies it's your chance to
decide if you're happy with the product
and to verify that it is actually as
advertised and I've got to say that I
honestly have no problem buying used
even when I suspect the cards in
question have been mined with a few of
my gtx 280s i suspected were mined with
because the seller was actually selling
it four of them
I don't assume any people who have just
4G text and ad sling around they were
all the same model but I didn't care I
got him for 300 bucks and she takes 1080
Sulphur still four hundred dollars today
maybe more than that in some places so I
saw does a good deal those cards work
fine if they didn't work out of the box
when I bought them I'd file a claim or
I'd message the seller directly and we'd
work on the refund again buyer
protection guarantee it's there to
protect the buyer from sellers who are
trying to scam you or who might mislead
you into buying a product you didn't
know wasn't functioning correctly I've
also gotten several maxwell cards from
ebay 90 to TI's 970
kind of detail in this video here all
from eBay and even found a few great
deals on our X cards for good measure a
rule of thumb though is to stick with
Maxwell or earlier in a MIDI aside and
minimize your risk of mining exposure
right so newer cards are more efficient
and thus more desirable in the eyes of
miners they're trying to save money
maximize profit but that said it's
difficult to turn down an RX 570 for a
hundred bucks
especially when the picture is revealed
just how clean it really was even if you
suspect it was mining you know I just
don't see it as a justifiable reason to
avoid such a good deal especially if the
card still works now a lot of this
obviously is my opinion it's totally
just based on my own experience with the
used market so if anything I'm just
trying to convince you that you should
consider the used market in the future
I'm not telling you should buy used over
new especially if it was mine with I
know that's a gamble you know to what
extent it's a gamble it just depends
it's found a card to card basis but if
your goal is to save money I think it's
worth a shot I will close though by
saying that I'm not the only one who has
an opinion on this obviously many other
tech tubers especially out there have
voiced their concerns either been
against this or for this you can find
videos to two prominent tech tubers link
below for now though I'm going to sign
off and let you guys listen to them so
I'll leave your feedback down below
always sure to check out the the
comments section for sure thumbs up
thumbs down you know what to do click
that red subscribe button if you feelin
special I'll catch you in the next one
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us and I hope you guys
enjoy what you're about hear from to
friends of mine I feel that they're
screwing people I think that since these
mining cards are almost used to the
point of non-existence there should be
something out there a law something that
says you know these cards should meaning
be acknowledged as hey this card was
used in mining you know almost kind of
like an industrial type standard because
let's think about it if a person takes
the card and they're mining with the car
they're not gaming isn't that industrial
you know because you're using something
to make financial game to an industry
you're buying a bunch of video cards
killing the gamers on prices and yet
you're trying to resell those cards
afterwards maybe for a little cheaper
but if these cards are virtually almost
all going to fail very fast they're
completely ripping people off and I'd
say the majority vote would go to yes
I would buy a used gram scale on my
invention I let me explain why because a
lot of people who buy mining graphs
cards will be setting the fan speeds to
100% but they'll also be dropping the
TDP power limits to around 80% sometimes
even less and now with that your grass
card essential of these graphs cards
that are mining could be your graphics
card because you could be buying it for
a really good price these graphics cards
essentially have been run underpowered
so they're not generating as much heat
so heat kills components we know this
but also overclocking as well over
vaulting if these things are being under
vaulted underpowered and they're running
at fifty five to six degrees all day
every day
they're running under that safety spec
they're running really well so they'll
be absolutely fine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
