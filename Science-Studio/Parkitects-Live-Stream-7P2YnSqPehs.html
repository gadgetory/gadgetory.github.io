testing one two three
one two three
I'm waiting I want to make sure that I'm
live like visually live before I before
I started doing everything we've had
nothing but struggles and let me tell
you folks mm-hmm it's not easy desktop
audio that's a little weird that should
be default okay there we go
okay all right that works all right try
to make sure there we go about coach do
not do to 1080 t aizen sli stay away
from ice alive you can a lot of games
are not optimized for it unless you just
have money to throw around
single card is the way to go alright
folks so um you guys can feel free to
ask questions and stuff like you
typically doing these live streams but
what I'm gonna do I'm actually showing
my second screen I cuz I'm gonna play
some place of architect and this is a
new game that well it's not it's not new
I think it's been off for a few months
on Steam but I have not played it
personally and I'm a huge fan of the
original RCT series so like roller
coaster tycoon 1 &amp;amp; 2 the third one kind
of sucked and then I got into I got into
planet coaster now the problem with
planet coaster is that it is almost too
technical so I like the fact that you
could do a lot more with like the bends
and the rollercoasters and stuff like
that customizability is insane but it's
almost it's almost too much and then on
top of that building design and all of
that very very difficult to pick up and
just kind of run with so we're gonna see
how good or bad parka text is this was a
game that got pretty good reviews I
think very positive reviews so far and
I'm gonna have to swing this over to the
other screen so give me one moment let's
see here graphics monitor to swing over
there go over there why are you not
going over there
go over there ain't working
all right let's just swing it over I
really don't want to keep this one dude
come on no there we go okay that's
better you guys can see it now I know it
looks like trash
ignore the overlap hopefully want to
deal with this too long let's see here
we're gonna max this baby out I'll go
ahead and I'll go ahead and turn up the
game volume I won't turn up too much if
it's annoying just let me know I can
turn it down wrap it in the hole you're
gonna find out very soon what's been
going on with the lawsuits
stay tuned let's see here target frame
rate doesn't really matter you guys are
not gonna see anything about 60 anyway
mods mods installed yeah
general okay alright looks fine and I'm
gonna go back and let's do really want
to play a camping we do sandbox just so
we can flat terrain large flat terrain
small Lake Park Hills Park even have a
tutorial loopy lagoon I want to start
from scratch when we gotta learn this on
my own and see how I guess so let's do
the flat nah screw it let's do Lake Park
alright I know I'm indecisive here how's
Jane what's with that and let's see what
happened what's going on gee rod how you
doing man is this literally like let's
see I'm gonna have to how did I just do
that okay so it is is it just one of
those like for viewpoint games kind of
like rollercoaster taking in that sense
I thought you could free pivot but
that's alright here we go
what's up the fireplace freak how you
doing my dude and is someone saying
there's a there's a delay no I'll see ya
I don't know
I just want to make sure I make sure all
right so this is Lake Park and you can
see the graphics here kind of trash but
that's that's kind of point you see like
planet coaster was was really good looks
really nice but it's just too technical
whereas here like you get like your grid
you know it's just a grid that you're
used to if you've played rollercoaster
tycoon
one or two and put like a kiosk here or
something let's say utility building
staff room Depot trash chute the staff
training room this is like more
technical than I thought it would be
also I realize that chat is like right
in the way so I'm gonna swing that chat
over because it's kind of annoying
let's do chat box whoops that wasn't the
right one
lock that unlock that and we're gonna
swing it over here yeah every guy looks
good enough okay now we're gonna lock it
back I'll go back down okay let's see no
we have okay these are shops they've
like a like a kiosk umbrellas okay a
vending machine souvenirs information
kiosks me where you go I scan place one
of them right there I can get I'm gonna
put some park benches and stuff up there
just put them all up in the corners no
trash bins there we go these are like
barrel trash bins these are regular ones
you just put a couple not that I'm too
concerned about litter in the very
beginning and then what about the
scenery here it's seen we got flower
boxes so this is reminding me a lot of
rollercoaster taking too which is cool
it's cool but yeah this is Li you have
fireplaces literally what roller coaster
taken would look like in 2019 well I
mean that's that's paying homage to the
original assuming that was the goal
let's go ahead just build a roller
coaster that's kind of what I'm curious
about because a lot of
the well I think a big drawback I move
this mic up you know one second I think
a huge drawback for liqueurs Tekken 2
was just the inability to get super
technical and specific when it came to
certain rollercoaster
I don't know attributes unless one that
camera a little further over so I'm not
like totally out of the shot
Michael mix mix she said $10 super Chet
I appreciate that sorry for butchering
your last name what's the best fan
layoffs Fillion Lee PC Levin dynamic I
have a 22 CL c7 or K 10 atti
but it's not an issue I'm just wondering
what the layout and number have worked
best for you so the way I have mine set
up I have intake on the side so next to
the motherboard and then I have a an
exhaust config for my AI oh so Ivan yeah
I have a pretty similar setup just fan
wise to you it sounds like mine's a 360
a IO but there I mean it's gonna be
pretty much the same as a 218 in terms
of performance so I mounted that a IO up
top and it exhausts you could put some
extra fans down below but I like the
fact that the fans space is populated
against the motherboard tray because
it's just kind of a cool unique feature
of the 11 dynamic let's see let's just
do a wooden roller coaster screw it
how do I rotate stuff I don't know how
to rotate anything oh yeah okay if you
hold it down hold down the left click
and you can kind of swing it around here
that's cool and then I'm hitting a Q and
E to swing this back and forth all right
so let's let's do it like like like here
and then okay yep looking this is
looking very much like RCT two folks and
that's a good thing
alright we're gonna build that build
that let's do five and it's a narrow
turn add the chain link is this cool
this is oh you can do steeper than that
okay yeah let's do the where's the
delete button there it is yeah that's
why you go really steep with it check
that out
couldn't do that with our ct2 so that's
cool delete delete and make sure that
was nothing super important nope that's
my brother talking about some old games
we used to play speaking of which oh
we're doing here so let's see build
build build build build okay so I'm
assuming these little like height marks
here little tick marks are they're just
showing you you know at what level
you're at it's not an accurate depiction
that's okay as long as I can reference I
don't want to go obviously any higher
than seven and seven and a half here
well I don't want to go any higher than
about seven and a quarter maybe seven
let's see TTR so thank you for showing
the game love's not perfect but it's a
small team indie and I've sunk a ton of
time into this game looking forward to
the next few updates like reverse
coaster building that would be pretty
dope yeah that's cool I mean this is
this game caught my eye because it
looked a lot like kind of a refined
roller coaster tycoon another thing too
it looks like you can swing this around
that's pretty cool so meanly pivot here
so you guys can see that
so in rct2 it was pretty much locked you
could do like a 45 degree turn or just a
0 degree flat you know incline so this
is actually a nice nice little addition
here let's go ahead and have it turn
just because we can and we'll build that
and then so okay I don't really know
what I'm doing oh whoa that's really
steep haha okay I wonder how that's
gonna play out in terms of yeah that's
that's pretty harsh each alright I don't
wanna go in the ground so let's just do
like a sharper there we go
straighten that out 1 0 okay and we're
gonna go back up but but slowly because
I don't want to rip people's faces off
and let's some get the other way now
let's do like a 25 degree turn I feel
like that's just gonna I feel like this
isn't gonna go off let's do that yeah
screw it straighten it back out and
that's cooled you can actually see it
live like you can see the rollercoaster
doing its thing they're gonna make it so
yeah it looks like it's going to so
that's nice you don't have to build the
whole thing and then like you know test
it out you can actually ensure that it's
gonna make it before you know before you
throw all that time and effort into it
and money frankly let's go back up and
we'll just kind of level it off like
that
go ahead and swing it around just still
going up I can't tell I think it is I
don't want to do that yep there we go
okay
oh okay so the mechanics are a little
weird I'm trying to figure that out if I
keep it angled still I want to keep
turning why can't I I don't want to go
down oh that's why okay I thought I was
trying to go down with it yeah that
straighten it out
uh-huh it's pretty cool it's pretty cool
and it's smooth you know killer what's
going on five dollar super chat from
Canada you were awesome I trust your PIN
on other channels I appreciate that I do
encourage you though to watch my fellow
tech tubers don't just go off of one
opinion you know you want to have as
well-rounded an opinion as possible and
you can really only get that by watching
multiple channels so while I appreciate
kind words it's important that you get
multiple viewpoints on the same thing
just so that you know not misinformed or
anything because one of us could get it
wrong like I've gotten it wrong in the
past you know so it's good to see
multiple people doing the same thing II
and I straighten that up we can start to
go up with it now if you want I would go
how are we looking so far all right so a
little stretched out a little weird
looking I kind of don't like how that
part of the coaster goes completely
under I just didn't really play out the
best aesthetically so let's go ahead and
start to pivot that now there we go
and then we can bring it oh yeah that's
much better much better and you guys are
definitely gonna pick up on my OCD after
watching me do this and we'll wait a
second here we don't want to completely
straighten it out all together yet now
we can
I wish there was a faster way to rotate
okay okay so it won't let you when it's
like just mechanically impossible right
because that's gonna really throw off
the coaster it won't let you overturn it
oh we can also stretch out the length of
the track that's cool
so instead of doing one tile or two
tiles you can do three or four so I
could actually save you some time in the
long run I could have done that here
with this turn especially that's really
nice let's see here
let's see how we doing in the chat over
there folks but buh buh sorry I'm gonna
go I'm gonna try to read more of that
I'm just kind of distracted am i swingin
right away yeah Oh what are you gonna
write these roller coasters I don't
think he can but that was something I
thought was really cool oh that's better
that's something I thought was really
cool about rct3 it's one of the few
things I thought was very cool about it
I don't know if we're gonna make that
height I'm not sure yet
we'll see I swing it around a little bit
shorten that up okay straighten it up
know that a little more link to that
okay it looks like it's gonna make it so
it's showing that it's actually making
it that's cool
I would doin but uh someone says they
didn't think I actually answered killers
question
oh sorry killer you're right it was
a--that's a method method appreciate you
let me know sorry killer you are saying
something about Channel yeah I addressed
that okay 1610 ATT I should I wait for a
3100 X we get an i7 okay the whole
question about waiting like it's such a
vague question like I don't know your
scenario I don't know if you're
comfortable where you are or not if
you're comfortable there's no point
upgrading like everyone asks it seems
like everyone asks that kind of question
and it's just it's not a question I can
answer for you because I'm not you I
don't know how you you know I don't know
how immediate your needs are so if you
if you feel like you need it
and you want the upgrade now then you
have really no choice right but to go
with the 9700 k so if it was me if
you're asking if whether I would do it I
would personally wait just there's
there's too much good stuff
on the horizon here from from AMD and it
just feels wrong to recommend I don't
know like unless you're just wanting to
go after Intel something from Intel
right now which by all means you can if
you want but personally I wouldn't just
because of again what's on the horizon
so that's my take on it but again you
might be different you might feel
differently about it I'm going to is
there like an S bend there is an S bend
but does it actually twist for me not
really that's gonna be a pretty hard
turn for the average person so don't
think we're gonna do that also we've got
helix helix up and down that's very cool
okay thanks again killer appreciate it
and thanks method for letting me know
ooh okay twopence says that you can ride
the roller coasters alright I'm excited
we're gonna have to ride it after this
and see what it looks like I'm trying to
get this to sit like slightly veer off
center I don't want to run straight into
this kind of want it to like wrap around
one more time and then come back to the
station but I'm just I don't yeah I
don't know maybe I should just do this
so now that it's flat how'd it turn just
a little bit up runway yep like that
but not go that far down why are they
going down okay it's cuz it was already
on the decline
alright that makes sense alright go down
uh-huh - alright that's that's good
straighten up I said seriously
underground are you joking come on that
is not underground
oh yeah it's gonna it's gonna force it
underground matter what so you have to
do that have it straighten up
now we gonna have to keep going oh yeah
no that's too far
okay Oh
flat
and now we're at a crossroads again so
which way should we have a go I just
have to twist the other way this way
how to do like that yep and straighten
back out again lot not cool we're
already on the ground it's convenient
not very long roller coaster I feel like
we should ever do more stuff but
whatever I kind of want to see it do its
thing so let's where's the brakes
we got brakes brakes brakes we even have
brakes in this game I see station marks
oh there it is I'm right in front of me
okay so brake there I don't know how
fast we'll be going so I wouldn't
include it and then we can do block
brakes go ahead and stretch this out a
bit more build and then we can have it
turn and there we go all right here we
go we built it built our first one okay
cool all right so and yeah it looks like
it's gonna make it into the station so
that's good
is this the entrance yep and there's the
exit okay so let's do this and let's
ride how do you how do you ride the ride
follow exit entrance hate to pan you
said you could ride the rides I can't I
can't figure it out
I'm clicking follow but that ain't
working
that's cool you can see g-forces dope
check that out so the red obviously is
were that those are positive G's so
that's it's for those who don't know
what a G is it's like gravity right 1g
is is the average or that the natural
pull averse you know gravitational field
on your body so you're gonna be feeling
as heavy as you do now
- geez you're gonna feel twice the force
of gravity on your body and so on so it
looks like 2.16 G's there that's not so
bad
that's one point five seven g one point
seven nine yeah that's fine and the
negative G's who they're really going up
in the air huh Oh point two nine G's
there that's something like Mars is
gravity so that's pretty cool
oh yeah see a two-pin thought i keep
that yeah you're talking about some
other game yeah I'll just say I couldn't
find a way to ride that in this one but
the fact you can see G's is really cool
I'm actually really intrigued by that I
almost prefer this because there's some
physics involved right it's showing you
what the game is going to yield in terms
of the see the like the excitement and
and nausea factor and all that stuff so
you actually seeing a real time wow just
that little turn there it's giving you
like one point five two g's and then
instantly 0.5 G's so I think that was
the ride is that is there another way to
see this
okay here we go here we go the nausea
rating is very low so that's great the
intensity rating is low that's it's okay
but the excitement rating is fifty point
five which is high which is really good
so in in roller coaster tycoon 2 I would
call this a big win because it's really
hard to get an exciting coat like roller
coaster that's also at least somewhat
intense that's not like super nauseating
because if this is really high then
people are gonna throw up everywhere I'm
not to hire more handyman or whether
they call them this one there's a ride
cam mod oh that's cool so I definitely
download that
especially for you guys cuz I feel like
that's something that you would actually
enjoy watching apart of me building this
in English I'm sure is pretty boring my
scenery rating overall and this one was
very low or bad yeah so so I could
definitely make this thing look a little
better let's try to build like a
building around it I've never done that
before do a zigzag up down up down and
have it at max g-forces for at least two
minutes okay alright let's do it
what does we'll just do it so let's get
a like a really fast it's like a Giga
coaster or something yeah here we go
geek coaster alright so let's do what
what Mir what meet meet Michael Michaels
interesting I'm going to build something
super super high this is just gonna be
here just for a few minutes just to show
you guys what it'll do and then now
let's just have it go like up pretty
fast and that's friggin high how high
can you go Jesus alright that's way up
there and then we're gonna take these
off and it's just gonna go straight down
oh my gosh okay
so you wanted like max Gees right so we
can have a go down no I want you guys to
see it well that's gonna be the most
cheese cuz it's the sharpest turn so do
that
and we'll do that and then we'll just do
that and then back down and then yeah
you get it right so this little yeah and
then we'll do some really sharp turns
with no bend at all so that's gonna
that's gonna hurt and is our test
coaster still yeah test coasters up
there oh gosh this isn't gonna be good
oh wow that is some G pulling right
there here and then back down and then
again we'll do it one more time just for
a good measure and then we'll have it go
back to station which is way over here
because that was a really tall coaster
um yeah we're gonna drop it drop it down
to the floor go and there we go alright
alright so here in here we're not gonna
open this up to the public because I
don't want people to die and okay
someone said someone said you need to
open the ride then select the cart to
write it yourself but if I select the
cart I don't understand there's no way
to do it
oh that's edit whoops sorry
yeah I'm not seeing the cart dude now
let's check our g-forces holy crap um I
guess it's not showing these yet because
the test didn't go that far over that's
that's probably why but yeah I can't
find a way to ride the ride so if you're
telling me there's a way to ride the
ride I'm not seeing it
there's just a follow option that's it
so let's just watch it do its thing
the game is like 30 bucks I think on
Steam so if you're interested thank you
I don't know if steam so does like the
24-hour money-back thing or whatever
like two hours of gameplay money back
that's one of those I think so you can
check it out
TTL wants me to open the ride yeah not
gonna happen I actually want to like try
to build something nice in this game in
this map so what I don't want people to
die and I'm sure that will happen so oh
if you open the okay you have to open
the ride and then you can write it okay
maybe that maybe that's that's what he's
saying here it goes oh my gosh those are
some G's right there all right what are
you guys thinking Nagi reading I think
it goes with a scale of ten so what are
you thinking very high seventy three
point four the intensity rating is three
hundred three hundred intensity reading
and the excitement is very low which I
can I can see I can see that
yeah I'm not I'm not seeing a way to
ride the ride so pretty sure I'll have
to get the mod for that and let's check
our g-forces let's see how many G's
we're pulling 11.24 yeah that Oh that'll
kill somebody and up here negative nine
basically you're gonna feel like you're
gonna feel like you need to be ejected
from your seat it's probably gonna break
your shoulders and collarbone all that
crap geez and then here
can we see lateral G's yeah lateral G's
okay here we so obviously going straight
you're not gonna have any lateral G's
but right here nine lateral G's you're
gonna have nine times the force of
Earth's gravity pulling you to to the
right oh that's pretty extreme I want to
have your longitudinal g-forces
longitudinal g-forces airtime hi how
many how much airtime
can we can we calculate that there's got
to be air time why is it not calculating
air time I'll get there something like
way up there one second of air time
figured you'd have air time down here
maybe that's not the same air time it's
okay that's just a G and then Vallois
how fast are we going down here 140
kilometres an hour if I right-click it's
like letting me build it looks like so
if you want to build from a particular
spot like if I want to change something
right here you just right-click and then
you can jump into it excuse me all right
scenery rating senior readings pretty
trash because I have no scenery so
that's very cool
yeah so like like Octavian said it's
gonna feel like you are falling like a
rock and then you're gonna feel light as
a feather probably a little more extreme
than that I think we can agree Octavian
you'll basically die and then you'll die
again if you didn't die the first time
then you'll die again and just the
repetitive cycle yep swing around here I
do have money I didn't know is that it
money let's look at the finances how we
doing so far we sold four dollars and
fifty cents in souvenirs and that is
down for the month of June that's not
good but it's been pretty steady the
past three months it's pretty good ride
maintenance it's costing about well I
don't know what it was
the with just the wooden roller coaster
ups and pretty sure we had the steel
coaster up at the same time why is
everyone
why aren't everyone pissed what's going
on this dude looks upset can I click on
them
can I click on nope oh here we go yeah
time span he spent a dollar 50 in the
park and he seems pretty upset or they
just are they just pissed because like I
don't know like there's nothing to do
maybe why are all my park benches like
destroyed just seriously wreck all this
stuff already what's going on there are
no low-intensity rides here that
interest me the vandalism over here is
really bad
the park entrance fee is a good deal was
one of my charging to get into the park
a dollar yeah you guys better not be
complaining if you look if you don't
like you just just leave yeah just just
leave we just get out of here all right
I guess I better connect the yeah
the ride is there a queue line I feel
like yeah there it is cute all right
let's do let's do something a little zig
zagging thing yep all right there you go
people there you go
and let's go ahead and open you up to
public this one's actually good remember
this is the one that we built that was
actually decent so very low nausea
reading so I don't expect anyone except
for like children and the occasional
adult to puke and then intensity ratings
pretty low as well
excitement rating is 50 point something
oh yeah there we go all right these
people better cheer up they better hey
you know I feel better after this this
is what a cheap ride here how much does
it cost me to say check my finances
again I'll show my expenses cost me uh I
don't even oh here we go here we go yeah
at least a few thousand dollars to build
this wooden roller coaster so I'm just
saying they better cheer it up let's see
give them something to do and maybe the
chair says yeah all right well hopefully
this cheers him up there's like four
people on this ride so far so maybe
they'll feel better about themselves I'm
just saying though like this is a lot of
vandalism for like 20 people on the park
like some of these people look pissed
like that guy looks mad
so you know like mad yeah he's gonna
cheer up after this though I just dude
like hi this chicks about to just like
pass out on the sidewalk like right now
there put some park benches there just
in case you can catch yourself yeah you
go there you go there's some more and
actually and put some trash bins here
too just in case anyone decided to puke
and save me the trouble of hiring some
handyman
I'm gonna go ahead and replace these
park benches because nobody's got any
appreciation for the park I don't even
know what I name the party on people
just knocking over trash cans like what
like that's all they come in to theme
parks to do put two there and I'm like
lights extreme Lancer so yeah lamps
looking like a regular lamp that doesn't
look weird that'll work okay and let's
see if people come out he looks up he
looks pretty happy now he looks happy is
he running to the exit
maybe he got maybe I pissed him off even
more where you going dude yo really oh
maybe he just ran out of places to go
oh no okay yeah okay he sees a losing
some happiness though so we're going to
get that back okay oh yeah true gonna
add some toilets we got to do that so it
says some toilets it's gonna be utility
buildings staff training trash chute I
want to put that there
let's see what oil it's alright so put
them there and it's open already that's
nice I'll have to manually open it yeah
let's see this dude happy he's a little
more happy now just to look but he's
dropping and happiness these people are
hard to please look like people sitting
still what's this dude what is he even
thinking right now wooden coaster was
awesome okay so he's just chillin right
he's just chillin after an enjoyable
coaster ride so that's cool all right I
wanted to go back here and build some
scenery because it's just barren right
now looks pretty boring so how do I do
that
that's a brush I don't want that okay
I'm looking for like buildings or
something decorations make something
other than trees props Center crops
maybe looking for some walls what is
this wheel like a water tower
you put that put that here so these are
something for buildings here we go
what is this base door base roof I'm not
looking for details fences gates put a
fence up so there's something yeah good
is that seriously a bent light post are
you guys kidding me someone doing
jumping like like pull-ups on this thing
and there's a knocked over trashcan ting
I'm like eh I'm gonna find whoever does
this if you guys see anyone vandalize
anything let me know I'm gonna drown
them throw them in the water all right
now I'm gonna take this tool again and
go back up to I'm trying to get familiar
with the UI
this is work in progress I gotta fix the
stupid light post someone Bend any we
can go and then that they said I get my
money back for it I did some of it no I
get all my money back for that's cool
okay
did you op you you I saw it I pick you
up alright let's see
I won't drown you I don't want to do
that I'm not that mean but I'll put you
way over here in nowhere Ville and yeah
look at look at that reaction she's like
good so yeah how did I get here oh gee I
don't know some mysterious force in this
guy good luck with uh with life okay
crack on PC forty Hong Kong or something
like that it's but I appreciate it thank
you for that says using an eighteen
hundred X with an H sous x 370
motherboard should I trust a sous and
slap their beta BIOS and present to
support or X 570 I'm look I think it's
worth a shot to begin with like a face
you says they're gonna do it then then
do it um and it sounds like you got was
that an ISO is it an ITX board I think
you'll have the support for it but I
mean worst case if you don't
it's unstable or whatever you can always
buy a new motherboard later I think it's
worth trying though for sure
so yeah I need to get a security officer
and that's somebody said that staff
management let's see haulers security
all right we're gonna hire sent 24
dollars a month who works for that
amount of money okay there we go and I
want to go back to building scenery
something building that one like I mean
like walkie here we go walls I want
something that's like wooden you know
kind of fits the theme what is that just
like a okay that'll work that'll work
all right and then swing it around this
way make sure you all want to have it
come out just a little more cool cool
and okay oh geez all right yeah so if
you hold shift down then you can go
whoops those wrong way wrong all right
let's go up there we go and that's how
you can add the second storey and I kind
of don't want to add like something too
tall a little weird
and we'll add some stuff later assuming
they have those okay now roof
they have roof roof there we go looking
for something that kind of blends in
really is there nothing what is this
flat I don't want a flat roof here we go
all right lift this up god it looks
terrible what is that it's like a piece
of charcoal I want something with some
color you know
we can change the coloring Lanza's start
but he it's not really the color I was
going for
yeah yeah I like that you can like
change it with a little color wheel but
I don't like how I can't match it just
straight up whatever it looks kind of
weird but we'll just go with it and then
this one when I raise up to here there
we go like that and then this one we can
raise up to here still looks a little
weird but just just roll with it we're
gonna swing it around we're gonna do it
like that yeah look it's my first time
folks I don't expect it looks super nice
and everything close it up with what is
that
oh gosh it looks bad um do we have do we
do we have like old triangle pieces yeah
that could work
I could work let's see I raise it to
there okay cool you couldn't do this in
rct2 so that's very nice again good to
see stuff like that so you can fill in
the ugly edges go ahead and do the other
side while we're at it drop that one
raise that that and swing it around okay
then we'll fill in the last two little
bits here boom and boom all right cool
looks a little weird that just roll with
it okay let's see how that chicks doing
way out here I'll probably bring her
back you're still alive if she's still
alive
Oh yep she's over here free-roaming how
are you doing I'm lost
you don't say wow she is she had some
issues right now let's go ahead and
bring her back I think purgatory was
good enough for that amount of time
uh ah where you going are you ain't
leaving yet you know even yeah yeah
that's right get back here
yeah that's right you don't like walking
on grass do ya
I learned that trick from RCT two what
we can do here is kind of close in this
these walls aren't looking that great
because you can kind of see through them
so I'm gonna fill those in it's at least
you can't see them you know yeah that
looks that looks good and same with this
one here just kind of fill in that
little wall that way it looks like it's
kind of closed in a little more and then
do we have any let's see maybe like
windows there we go we have some windows
in there put one there all right I mean
that looks okay looks okay to me
the roofs looking a little weird but
whatever and okay I'll let people out
now fine fine I'll put it back this do
you guys stuff over here doing something
I don't know what he was doing are you
doing there's no high intensity riots
around here that interests me bro
there's one of right here in front
I should probably name this by the way
how do I rename it oh it was literally
right there by the name there we go
let's call this one um let's call it the
blockbuster
yeah one word not trademarked we go and
so far the rides been great no issues
and no maintenance wise has been pretty
reliable so that's it's that's pretty
good it's a girl like up here flowers
some flowers down you know just just
spice things up a bit and maybe put some
like let's see what do we have here
these old tulip patches just run these
along three four oh whoops
just deleted that by accident okay yep
just a couple more benches park benches
ain't nothing wrong with that yeah
people need some places to sit why are
these broken still bro my security guard
is not doing jack where is he can you
punish security guards are you doing
wandering around that's exactly what
you're doing can you um
train to level one there are no training
rooms oh that's why he's not freaking
trained yet hmm that's weird
Bob you're saying I muted but everyone
can hear me except for you I think so
you might want to bump up that audio bro
let's see here
I need a training center yeah that's
exactly why wasn't doing his friggin job
he doesn't know how to do it yet cuz he
hasn't been trained oh I keep rotating
this let's just do it like just put
right there oh no wait I should have
done that do I move it move it further
back there you go okay all right now get
trained bro
David every time your security guy takes
a piss someone breaks a bitch that's
literally what's happening all right
this guy needs to be trained
heading to the staff room yeah and you
better pick it up beer pick up the pace
security guard where are you
can I lock on to you where are you yeah
right there uh-huh you look like the guy
who's actually vandalizing that then why
are you dressed like that no where are
you going where you going this way guy
doesn't even know the park that he's
working in he's like confused there's
only like two places to go you can go in
the freakin park right here there's only
one ride or you can go what are you
thinking about you thinking about other
security guards I'm gonna make you work
alone you're gonna work 12-hour shifts
no overtime it's legal in my my world so
all right now he's sitting in there he's
just staring at a wall but I think it's
I think it's going well I don't need a
mechanic yet it's been pretty
this one's been all right I'll hire a
mechanic when I have to but I'm not
gonna waste money you know I mean is
there like a do not enter like sign or
something yeah here we go path sign and
whoops wrong way Jesus hey you okay this
one how you deleted all right I did it I
put it in the wrong line that's how it
has to go yep like that oh okay okay no
entry there we go no nice so now unless
people can vandalize is there a way to
like look through scenery is that an
option a crash in a nearby theme park
has scared potential customers your Park
will see a decrease in visitors for
short are you kidding me because some
other freakin Park can't keep its crap
together I get hurt for it Pepsi's
looking at me right now like brah
medical staff or Medical Center yeah no
people look pretty healthy to me
something to waste the money on this
isn't a big enough park I think to
justify all that money being thrown at
it let's fix that
again why are these park benches
different I love the same ones where are
they decent nope
where are the original park benches that
I had those weren't the ones I was using
woman yeah these okay this is a security
guard is he out now is he out working
are you doing your wandering around
level two I'm gonna train you to level
two now you had tt-rs says he's got the
same issues with science I'm glad I'm
not the only one I feel like I should be
slightly better at this cuz I've played
RCT two so much but also I have like a
ton of the same flowers like all around
so I'm gonna switch it up a little bit
let's do you like red yeah there we go
looks a little better flowers around the
bathroom stall we have like bushes and
stuff plants there we go plan tree well
that's nice they don't connect too
though so you can kind of like just
spread them wherever you want all right
so I wanted to get them to like lock
together so it looks a little neater but
I have a feeling that's not gonna happen
you're like hedges or something plants
nope same thing um fountain it's pretty
nice one of those there yeah that's cool
it is raining everyone's pissed
they don't have umbrellas I should
probably add an umbrella shop I'm gonna
charge him a ton of money that's right
intervening opportunity folks yep we're
gonna charge you guys like ten bucks
yeah it seems legit and is it open out
of stock
wait how do you add stock what what is
this
I need like people to transport okay I
guess there's like a guy that you can do
that haulers
oh are you serious I have to hire some
guy to frickin transport all this crap
it's actually pretty cool it's like
that's a feature that we definitely
didn't have from really mr. deck into
but it's I mean it's a real part of like
daily park running right so I get it so
yeah sorry folks y'all got rained on and
done I could do
wow he's ridden blockbusters six times I
should probably add something else just
so there's like some variety let's see
let's do a ferris wheel it's like pretty
de-facto and just put yeah put that
there I'm actually yeah let's do that
and then we'll do like that okay yeah
Park
okay looks good to me and we'll open it
up and let's put something in the middle
there
yes sculpture I'm like trying my best to
you know spice it up a little bit yeah
it's just feel like a call it's like a
headstone like right like it's just like
a graveyard right in front of the ferris
wheel
crates put some crates
that's cool that'll work do a crate on
top of a crate yeah that looks like it
fits yeah and then we doing over there
God people are knocking over these
freaking trash cans why what have I done
to you yeah and you see these stupid
benches are not sticking no it's not the
right one is that the one I just picked
why is that look at different color
it seriously looks like it's a different
color but it's not maybe that bench is
just different it was my fault
you know I was using the wrong bench
before I'm going crazy and going crazy I
really am oh okay as my Hall or not done
anything yet
we are supposed to be yeah delivering
umbrellas where are you yeah mm-hmm
let's go let's go chop chop chop chop
chop chop how many people we have in the
park 65 all right I probably should have
made this a bigger entrance than it is
there's like one slim little pathway
there and I feel like it's gonna get
super crowded once we got more stuff
because I don't think obviously there's
one wooden roller coaster is not gonna
cut it
what can we do here but we can change
the color of the track wow that's really
bright you like a grey or something
that's really cool like a black I really
like you can kind of scroll across the
entire color palette like that's really
convenient something you couldn't do in
roller coaster tycoon um safety 90%
budget 90% maintenance level you need to
close this ride to change these settings
cars Bertrand obviously yeah ten times
blockbuster was awesome seven times
blockbuster was a really good deal
meaning really good deal my charging
people to read this right no revenue
maybe I am no way
why are people saying it's a good deal
you only have to pay to enter the park
right which this should be way higher by
the way let's see five bucks I feel like
people are paying to get into this if
you guys see that's that's like my
revenue just for blockbusters so where's
this money coming from why am I getting
paid for this I wanted to be free
oh there it is right in front of me okay
zero that's better yeah it's just weird
when you get a paper ride like you
should be able to get in or either ride
as many times as you want I think that's
that's best
let's put like a little pavilion over
this part of this ride it's looking a
little weird by itself
let's do walls again do we have like
anything other than just like this I
guess that's okay for the track we'll do
that and just do like this small roof
where's the small one I'm looking for
the small roof there like that something
like that yeah sorry yeah I need to keep
track of like the hex values of these
things so I can actually match them is
right now it ain't matched up there we
go okay and then yeah we should probably
put something on me I just go back down
again to the same thing do we have like
the small triangle one no new not seeing
it
that sucks figured they'd have something
like that maybe they do I'm just not
looking I tell you what the rotating
mechanics though could use a little work
I feel like I'm feel like I'm not
getting that right yeah we'll just we'll
just go all the way across there and
there and there and there I wanted
something for like the I'm saying for
like the little triangle low part of the
roof like kind like we have oh here it
is
yeah I was looking for it okay yeah
that's a lot better than one here it's
just something you know it just gives us
some Flair so it's just yeah this makes
people feel like there's more let's see
what our decoration very low god I built
a whole frickin building for this thing
and it's still very low do they want
stuff like over here maybe they want
something over here we have something
like really large to put here let's see
what's under large well that's not that
sinister hand five-dollar Canadian super
check how are you doing I am doing fine
good sir assuming you are a guy I'm
assuming you are you uh you live in
Canada so could be well I guess your
time zones are the same as ours happy
Saturday I hope you had a good weekend
so far rocketship how big is this he's
not really like huge scenery items I
need like something you know crazy
that's all nature sculptures that kind
of small sculptures archways borders
bill okay we got any big buildings nope
the tower
yeah maybe maybe it's trees maybe maybe
I just need more trees I don't know
because there aren't yeah you're right
there aren't many trees here so let's
just do like what kind of trees are here
already guess like these right so I
should start spreading them all out it's
very cool even the animation for the
trees like when you place it it kind of
like grows into place it's cool it's
just subtle stuff that you know like
these developers put a lot of time and
effort into I see that I appreciate it
and alright there's a lot more trees now
I would say this is it's still not dense
it's not like a typical you know dense
tree area but it's something and let's
see if that changed it at all
decoration is just low so the trees did
something but they didn't do very much
so yeah I'm gonna have to be a little
more creative with that someone like me
to build a super-dense coaster like a
super compact coaster so what we can do
is start with mmm it's really gonna
depend on the type of coaster we choose
we could do like a wild mouse coaster
because these have really sharp turns
and we can go up pretty high as well so
let's see get it like right here like as
small as possible actually I tell you
what well go ahead and paint oops that's
the brush terrain yeah okay let's go
ahead and do some some dirt
ooh yeah that's what I wanted okay so
we're gonna go ahead and map out how
dense we want this thing just like right
there okay and I want that grass yep
okay
so now let's go back into here and let's
set up wild mouse coaster and yep David
I'm doing it actually right now
thanks for the super chat but I saw your
chat I'm just gonna I'm gonna try I'm
not gonna be very good at it let's have
like a separate exit and entrance thing
like let's have like let's do like the
exit like here I just just bear with me
and then let's do the entrance here
where's the station station can you not
do that there it is okay
all right there's four of those straight
up and just have it go up each it's
probably probably not high enough but
whatever we'll work with it anyway
straight down straight up a little tall
man let's kinda have it like turn a
little bit
oh yeah it's a little too far okay
actually just realize it's gonna cut me
off um I should probably just delete
this yeah I'm just gonna scrap that idea
there we go
you know it kind of sucks that you can't
oh there we go that's that's what I was
trying to do did it
okay this is not gonna go well gonna do
tell I can already tell this isn't gonna
go on and sound stop there go down down
a can just for the lawls am i seriously
turn sideways
all right
yeah yeah up up and then so we get that
way okay we're getting there whoo that's
a little too far
you know the I think the hardest part
about this is the visual thing like I
feel like that well that's not it's not
gonna work if I could just figure out
how to yeah like build that
but then don't go
well that work nope I said I still won't
work
why would that not work maybe the carts
too tall okay so it's gonna have to be
sharp turn flat or semi flat and we'll
straighten this back out
oops
okay something like that then we'll turn
it again
Oh is he getting super compact
I feel like that's just gonna throw it
like well
yeah there we go that'll work flatten it
out straighten it up is that gonna be
too tall I feel like that's gonna be too
tall you have to be like that
this isn't gonna be super compact now
that I'm into it like I realize I just
kind of feel a lot harder then it then
it sounds swing that around and I'll
like try my best to turn it somehow oh
gosh that's gonna pull some cheese I can
already tell probably not the best know
what screw it let's like let's make it a
goal of ours to pull some G's yeah boom
see that that's that so that's a massive
G puller right there I really don't like
that that like tunnel thing is there I
kind of look stupid yeah I don't work
that stop and then well I gotta have a
place for my entrance so that's not
really gonna work I didn't think that
one through can I not go over that nope
no way you just keep going straight and
then swing it around again cuz I gotta
bring it back here somehow people have
to go a little outside of my if that is
like stupid
all right all right I'm gonna have to
cheat a little bit
yep but just like that that's what I'm
not to do now all the way around it and
yeah okay so down flatten this is gonna
work right are you serious that's still
not low enough
ah okay
well that kind of sucks
so do that there now it's low enough uh
you know it's still gonna block me there
oh this is not really well planned out
okay
scrapping that idea we're just gonna
have it do some quick turns boom boom
kind of like how they work in real life
and do that and then we'll do it a
little yeah and then a shorter one good
little up swinging around and very far
down
huh
or is this compact looking right I think
this fits the bill gonna have to have it
drop pretty fast again though ooh that
runs under the ground okay
that's still gonna hit me this one item
before we're just head of come up twice
then back down there we go
this is looking kind of cool it's pretty
compact one don't you think yeah TTR I
was talking earlier in this talking
earlier in this livestream about the
differences between planet coaster and
and in this game this game is very
simplistic by that standard right but
that's kind of the point like that was
could you stop hitting the mic please
hey huh huh
can you stop that but I mean that was
the point right this is this is made
after a game that was simplistic for a
good reason I think and Pepsi seriously
you like right in the way the screen no
okay okay yeah all right thank you and I
think we have to keep us on the crowd
yeah there's no way that that's gonna
fit so let's do some breaks 1 2 and then
some block breaks whoops okay I gotta
turn off the clock face there we go and
then yeah because I have all this extra
space I guess I'll just add more station
to it so we have more cars bill I mean
that's not like a super compact roller
coaster but like it takes up all the
space in the dirt area it was kind of
what I wanted and let's see do it okay
that's too late that's way too few cars
Pepsi Moo can you Pepsi true the guests
need food that's for sure
oh they look pissed how we doing over
there oh no they don't seem really
hungry I mean their hunger is kind of
averaged but they're probably leaving oh
these guys are stuck ok yep time to hire
a mechanic hire one that's higher to
just because I want to train one of them
all the others just goofing off and
yeah Pepsi is just getting in a way
every day I think she's hungry she just
woke up she wants attention
let's see chain lift speed that's fine
looking for the number of cars I always
saw that earlier where is that can you
not control a number of course
you can only add two are you serious
alright so here's what we'll do delete
delete then we'll just do that that and
let's see we add more trains hey we're
gonna add three now it's still not a lot
yeah that's not very much I wish you
could had a fourth there at least a
fourth one there Pepsi hey stop oh she's
eating paper now come get oh get out of
there gift get back from behind there I
talked to her like she can understand me
anyway let's watch this thing do its
work pretty sharp there that one's a
little better pretty sharp there
this one's sharp ooh I turned that one
so it shouldn't be too bad but I feel
like yeah that last one right there is
pretty sharp
let's see what the intensity is that's
not bad so the medium medium intensity
there excitement's medium - Oh way that
those are outdated values though let's
wait for this one to come in and again
decorations pretty low or whatever so
these are I believe I don't know why
it's not showing me the updated ones yet
maybe so this car hey Aki Pepsi you
really doing this right now
really
so I'm not showing me updated value so
it's really weird anyway it's it's it's
good it this is a good game I will say
that that this this has even though the
graphics are like you know not great in
terms of just like that's the point they
did it on purpose because roller coaster
tycoon two's graphics weren't great game
came out you know over well over a
decade ago so it's that game came out
what around 2000 I don't even remember
someone will google it but anyway I know
it was that when I was very very young
and I enjoyed it and this literally pays
homage to it it's actually I mean it
takes a ton of cues from it but it's its
own game and its own right right because
you can you can see so many cool things
look you can see the freaking g-force is
like see 0.62 G's there 2.13 G's there
2.4 there like that's really that's
really nice and you can see laterals you
can see visuals they're pulling negative
1.3 there they're pulling are they
pulling down here can't even see that
one 1.83 that's that's pretty high there
and that one actually looks pretty high
so I kind of want to change that one or
at least like put it put some brakes
here or something so that it's not so
aggressive but anyway my thoughts in the
game is the first time I've ever played
it pretty nice it is kind of I mean it's
kind of expensive at 30 bucks but at the
same time it's not like a huge triple a
title that's gonna you know sell for 60
bucks or more like it's it's half price
and at least the devs can kind of see
that that this game is gonna be more for
like the niche like old-school tycoon
player know because that's what this is
like they weren't going after you know
planet coaster or anything like that so
yeah I think it's really cool I
appreciate you guys watching I'm going
down this one cuz I might go pepsi some
attention and I think I got a feeder and
stuff but you guys have been awesome I
appreciate that and stay tuned because
we're gonna do something like this next
week again I have designated separate
like it's a YouTube when I you two
actually at all it's a Google hangout
for members so if you remember and you
didn't drop by around 8 o'clock tonight
which is about 3 hours ago we did a live
call for members so that's the way for
me to be more personal and like talk to
people who actually throw money at me
because otherwise you probably feel like
you're not getting much for your money
and I totally understand that so that's
why the the money or that that's why the
hangouts thing exists and it's just it's
like a call set up like I'll have a
video call for me so it was a little
more personal but you don't have to turn
on your your video camera whatever it
can just be audio and we can talk about
whatever you want and the members right
now I think we only have like 20 or 30
members so it's fairly exclusive at this
point so if you do decide to become a
member it's like 5 bucks and you'll get
access to that every week and you can
bring literally bring like a list of
questions I really don't care just just
bring whatever you want you don't have
to bring lists at all we can just talk
about random crap you see on TV I don't
care but it's just a way for us to get a
little more personal and for you to feel
like you're actually getting a little
more for your money so I thank you to
those who are members even if you can't
stop by I'll try to be a little more
flexible in time if you're like in you
know the UK or something obviously 8
p.m. here it's like what 2 3 a.m. over
there so it's not very convenient but
I'm just gonna have to work with what we
have and try to appeal so the most
people that I can so more feedback in
that can all be thrown into the the
discord it's linked down below and we
share it with Brian from tech yes City
you guys know the whole spiel David
Morse is now a member I appreciate that
David you are awesome and hopefully you
feel like you get your money's worth
every Saturday at 8 p.m. I understand
it's a weekend's gonna be a little rough
but I think it's a little better than
choosing a weekday when people work
especially they were late night shifts
so it kind of frees up the schedule for
you if you have some time and look you
can pop into the call for five minutes
ask a question and then leave it's ok
I'm just there for you guys it's a way
for me to kind of again reach out to you
on a more personal level and get to just
chat with you I don't want you to feel
like you have to pay to be my friend
it's just a way for for me to set apart
those kind of advantages or perks from
just the general subscriber because most
subscribers won't you know they won't
pay for anything and I get that like a
majority people won't and that's
totaling like most of the YouTube con
content that I consume I don't pay
anything to that creator except for my
viewership and maybe a sub naught and
then ads and stuff right so this is just
our way of trying to differentiate
ourselves and and make it feel again a
little more personal I'll stop talking
now you guys have been awesome thanks
for watching and hopefully you stay
tuned for more videos this week we got
coming up a very cool video with the
homemade maple X Pro my personal laptops
behind me did a cool video on that stay
tuned for that and a few other PC
related things coming your way including
a couple giveaways that I'm sure you
will enjoy anyway I'm not you guys
thanks for watching and I'll catch you
in then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
