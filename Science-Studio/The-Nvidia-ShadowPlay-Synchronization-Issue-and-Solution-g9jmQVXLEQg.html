the launch of our new channel
entertainment studio which you can check
out or right here both of our rigs were
capable of recording gameplay at 60fps
but the software we were using Nvidia
shadowplay was creating an issue one
that we can now finally confirm has been
fixed for good once we finished
upgrading McClellan's pc he and i
conducted a test run in which both of us
hopped online and played a bit of black
ops 3 we were recording our own audio
with audacity of software I highly
recommend you can find it in this
video's description as well as Nvidia
shadowplay which I mentioned earlier was
being used to record in-game footage so
after about an hour of playing we called
it quits finalized our audio to overlay
the game footage and hopped into Adobe
Premiere cue the big issue so our audio
was not synchronized with our video and
I should note that it wasn't just our
audacity recordings that were out of
whack so was ingame audio which made
absolutely no sense to me at the time
have a look
so how could ingame audio which is
wrapped up in the video file format that
is mp4 be out of sync with the video its
accompanying it didn't make sense to me
further investigation led me to find out
that shadowplay record to gameplay using
a variable frame rate meaning that video
itself is constantly fluctuating between
a minimum and maximum frame rate now
this might be old news for those of you
who were always recording gameplay with
shadow play but for someone like myself
who's never dedicated a video solely to
just in-game footage I was at a loss for
words so Nvidia shadowplay records at a
variable framerate and Adobe Premiere
only features support for constant or
fixed frame rates which is kind of the
standard so what a bummer the beginning
of every clip would look and sound great
as it should but after a few seconds or
minutes the audio would drift severely
behind the video if this looks and
sounds like something you've encountered
in the past then chances are you've
likely heard of this simple solution
handbrake handbrake is a multi-platform
multi codec open source program that
allows users to upload and transcode
various supported media into desired
formats but when I should mention it's
100% free folks there are still good
people on this planet so to fix the
audio video synchronization issue with
shadow play within Adobe Premiere Pro
and other video editing programs simply
open up handbrake select source at the
top left and select either single file
or folder depending on how many videos
you wish to transcode once the file or
files have been imported navigate to the
video tab and select constant framerate
boom there's our problem and there's our
solution leave the video codec framerate
and quality the same as the source so
just slide this bar all the way to the
right for lossless footage under the
Audio tab select the bitrate tab and
click 192 kilobits per second this is
the native audio quality of shadow play
footage any less than this and your
audio won't sound as clear nor crisp
once these tasks are completed select
start up top and watch as your computer
converts variable video to constant
video perfect for Adobe Premiere which
Michael Evan and I use on a daily basis
do keep in mind that this encoding
process could take a while depending on
your processors potential and the total
file size in question I'm super happy
that we're now able to record and edit
footage but
the hassle-free I mean we look like
total noobs haven't allegri sync the
audio with the video every minute or so
it was it was a severe pain and thanks
to handbrake we no longer have to deal
with the issue of importing variable
framerate footage into a program that
only supports constant frame rates there
was a bit of ignorance in play on our
part but come on in video variable frame
rates Adobe Premiere doesn't like
variable frame rates and neither do i
handbrake is the simple solution if
you're interested in copying our editing
and recording workflow and it will help
you out too especially if you plan on
using shadowplay as your in-game
recorder okay so for those of you who
decided to stick around to the end of
this video thank you very much as a
reward I have two special announcements
I'd like to make the first is in regards
to the two giveaways we had going on if
you're aware of what the second giveaway
was that's because you're probably not
follow me on Twitter whoops or you're
not just you know on Twitter at all
period but the the first giveaway
obviously was the two rx4 ad giveaways
one was sponsored by candid and the
other was sponsored by science studio
that's the global giveaway that ends
tomorrow night at midnight at Sunday
night Monday morning transition is when
that ends and I'll announce the winners
Monday afternoon and then the second
giveaway was just for the Twitter
followers from deep cool they were
giving away to captain 240 EXO that's
their newest 240 millimeter all on one
radiator water loop combo and that was
only for science studio viewers I made
it just a Twitter based thing because I
wanted to reward those who took the time
to follow the channel and who still do
actively follow it all you have to do to
enter that by the way has just retweet
the tweet you'll find it something it's
somewhere up top in my newsfeed all I
have to do is retweet that and boom
you're entered it's a global giveaway
they're just you know just do that deep
cool is gonna send both of them out to
whoever wins either one of them there's
gonna be two of them they're giving away
the second announcement I'd like to make
is that I will be hosting a live Q&amp;amp;A
session for the part 2 of the Q&amp;amp;A series
here on the channel I did part 1 earlier
you can check it out right here if you
haven't already but a part two I want it
to be more interactive so I want to
interact with you guys y'all are awesome
I mean there are a few trolls out there
I can I can pretty much weed you guys
out but for the most part you guys are
super cool you're interested in this
kind of stuff same things I am and
that's that's why I like this community
so I want to do a live Q&amp;amp;A session it
will be I wrote
down so I didn't say anything wrong okay
so Sunday April 28th that's tomorrow
relative to the posting date of this
video at 3 p.m. CST that's Central
Standard Time so that's Chicago time in
the United States now I know that that's
gonna end up being 3 a.m. somewhere else
that's actually that time zone is
Kazakhstan there's a few other countries
involved in that small time zone but
you're six hours ahead of UTC and we're
six hours behind UTC so I know you're
probably not gonna be up at 3 a.m. to
watch the the live Q&amp;amp;A session but don't
worry I'll have the finalized product
posted on product like it's like I'm
trying to sell something I'll have the
final video posted on the channel soon
after that so don't worry you won't miss
anything you just won't be able to ask
questions but if you are concerned about
that you can ask me a question directly
on Twitter again handle is in this
video's description okay so that's it
for the new segment of this video thanks
for sitting around at the very end if
you'd like this video be sure to give it
a thumbs up give it a thumbs down if you
do feel the complete opposite or if you
hate everything about life be sure to
click the subscribe button if you
haven't already and stay tuned for some
interesting tech related videos here on
the channel
this is science to do thanks for
learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
