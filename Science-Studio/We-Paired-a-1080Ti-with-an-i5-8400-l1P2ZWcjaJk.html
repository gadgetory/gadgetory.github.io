question can you pair an i-5 8400 with
the 10 atti and obviously the answer is
yes you could if you wanted but the real
question is should you because 95 80 400
seeing that it only has 6 cores and
right no hyper threading and it's a
locked processor because Intel is Intel
is that still a good combo for an
overkill like quote-unquote overkill
graphics card like a gtx 980ti
especially for a higher end you know
higher resolution gaming like 1440p and
even 4k I have strong hopes for this
build I think it will do really well and
it is a case yes for the i5 8400 so if
all you want to do is game then you
might want to copy this build we're
gonna throw benchmarks in at the end of
this video so stay tuned for that but
for now I'm gonna have my wife Lisa
build this one because it's been a while
since she's got her hands on some
hardware you guys know what I'm talking
about right so quick rundown of the
parts Before we jump into this and you
guys know you can find all the stuff
link below usually tied to our Amazon
and Newegg affiliate account so we do
get a small kickback if you decide to
buy something through the links we
appreciate that if you want to kind of
pick and choose and build your own based
off of what we're throwing out here
that's perfectly fine you don't have to
abide by this set of products by any
means and we're actually not even being
paid to use any of these parts this is
just something that I've wanted to put
together for a long time because I like
a white color scheme I like these
components these are components I would
choose if I was building my own eye 5
based rig purely for gaming so starting
first obviously we have the i5 8400 it
is a 6 core 6 thread processor from
Intel running around 200 USD it's not
too bad because it does have that 2 core
bump right from the previous i5
generation and even though it's not
overclockable it's still a great gaming
processor will show that here shortly we
have a B 360 gaming Arctic motherboard
from MSI this is a pretty beast
motherboard because well not only does
it cost considerably less than what
we've been used to seeing right in the
coffee like space Z 370 so this is a
cheap motherboard and does have a white
PCB so it should look pretty sweet and
our fantex
350 X we'll get to that soon as well we
have a castle 240 RGB cooler from deep
cool that we saw at Computex I want to
just kind of use it to see what it looks
like in the real world we saw it on
display at plenty at the deep cool
buthe we have a coolermaster a vertical
graphics paramount just because I'm more
or less worried about aesthetics in this
build again White's gonna look pretty
cool in here we have some custom sleeve
cables here these are from Tony over
ability PC customs his channels link
down below check his channel for sure
there's a lot of enthusiasts build and
talks about a lot of his first-hand
accounts and experience in building
custom PC so again give him a shout-out
for short Tony's a good friend of mine
we have a 2 terabyte hard drive good for
again this is a gaming PC plenty of
games in our Steam library we have a 500
gig I believe Samsung Evo Drive this is
good for your beer boot OS and anything
that you want to be very snappy write
program wise in your operating system we
have a gigabyte GTX 10 atti gaming this
is a white shroud model it does not have
a backplate not worried about it though
because again we're turning the graphics
card vertically so that that shroud can
look great from the front we have 16
gigs of team grouped e-force Nighthawk
RGB modules these are the white shroud
DRAM modules and I believe they are
clocked to 3000 megahertz 16 gigs should
be plenty for a gaming system and then
further to our right here we have a
straight power 11 be quiet
750 watt power supply it's fully modular
so that's really awesome even though we
have extensions we should have plenty of
room in the fan Tech's 350 X we have a
lot of other stuff in fan text too that
they just want the throw and see if we
wanted to use and we are definitely
going to out of RGB components we have
digital RGB x' up top and then we have
four they're kind of like RGB frames if
you will and they'll turn non RGB fans
into RGB fans you guys will see that you
know when we actually build the thing so
stay tuned for that looks really good
and we have an RGB controller on top of
those four kits so we are ready to build
I'm gonna give you guys some insights
into the building experience of the 350
X soon as well this isn't a new case by
any means and it's relatively new but
reviews have already hit YouTube so
we're just gonna building it and tell
you our experience as we go along so
with that she's gonna build she didn't
expect me to do that now it's awkward
it's not awkward
there you go that's the toughest part
it's toughest part of building PZ it is
did you just build a fancy new system
like we did right here your next step
would be to install an operating system
we have Windows 10 Pro running on this
machine we activated it using s CD key
at a CD key calm you can often find
discounted keys and other codes for
games and the like
so you find a game via Steam for 40 or
50 bucks be sure to check a CD key first
because they might have a for a cheaper
these are just codes that you enter in
Steam you can buy from s CD key and
you'll be able to download the game
directly through Steam so you're just
getting the codes from s CD key and
these will often allow you to activate
or download games you would otherwise
have to purchase in the app itself in
our case we bought a Windows 10 Pro key
for $14 and that was a clean digital
license activation with Windows 10 Pro
so you won't have any watermark on your
desktop anymore you can set your own
background Sun into your own Microsoft
account and transfer all of your data
accordingly you can find codes for other
software on the side as well including
those for Microsoft Office so access to
Microsoft Word Excel PowerPoint you guys
get the gist of it you can find links to
all this stuff down below the video
description by the way along with 10%
off codes for your next s CD key
purchase big thanks to them for
sponsoring this video well everyone I
hope you enjoyed it the build log
different perspective usually I'm
mounting the camera to a tripod and
calling it a day but this one was more
POV and Lisa enjoyed building it she did
like 95% of this I handled some of the
cable management that was about it but
I'm really pleased with how this turned
out I think it turned out better than I
thought it would this is the 350 X from
fan text the case is beautiful it comes
in and I think around 69 bucks or so and
let me tell you the heck of a bargain I
used to promote the P 300 as a super you
know bargain case that didn't make too
many compromises on the aesthetic so you
get tempered glass and integrated RGB
capabilities and whatnot but let me tell
you the 350 X takes it to another level
for another 10 bucks or so this case
looks really good and you can get it
with this white interior which would
look great if you have something like a
white motherboard we went with the MSI B
360 Arctic and it is just it's beautiful
it's one of the best looking B 360
boards out there MSI always kills it
with their tongue off Arctic series
boards and this one is no exception
now essentially everything this built is
already be capable and I've purposely
left everything like rainbow puke colors
because I just want to show you the
dynamic looking effects of all of these
components so first off the deep cool
castle 2
40 here this is a AIO that we found to
be pretty cool looking very unique at
Computex in taiwan for 2018 and the
equal sent us one almost immediately
after we got back so I figured I'd throw
in this build here it's perfect
application might be a bit overkill for
a locked until I 580 400 but it's gonna
keep things nice and quiet temperatures
are just beautiful even under full load
and that's due in part to the Lotte
teepee of the CEP also because you can't
overclock it and and the good thing is
because we're able to pair this cpu with
a lock skew chipset the B 360 chipset we
didn't have to spend more money than we
needed to get additional Zi 370 features
we wouldn't otherwise need so the beater
60 board is great this one again it
looks awesome in this case and I think
everything else just kind of blended
together very well we have team group T
force Nighthawk or white modules in
there 16 gigs in total we could have
gone for 8 that might have been a little
under kill 8 gigs is gonna be pushing it
definitely in some newer triple-a titles
16 is still the sweet spot any more than
that and it's just overkill so I only
put 2 modules in here and it still looks
great the way it is another two
important features of this puzzle were
the gigabyte GTX 10 D the TI gaming card
this one has a white shroud with the
orange accents it matches our team group
modules perfectly so I think this is a
good combination of sorts if you want to
go for a cup white and orange little
count it creamsicle look I see you have
you pointed that out the last time we
combined these two components so we use
a cooler master kit to turn the card
vertically under run some tests to see
if we're seeing any major performance
degradation using that riser cable which
sometimes riser cables can really chop
into your FPS mission because the
connections are not perfect so I'll be
running some tests with them without the
riser cable and just trying to see you
know if we're compromising anything in
that sense and also from an airflow
perspective the cooler master bracket
juxtaposes the card far enough from the
left side panel to allow decent airflow
to be pulled into the case the problem
is though because we had to front mount
our a i/o that temperature of the air
entering the case it's gonna be a little
warmer than ambient so the card will be
pulling in some slightly warmer air than
it should but I don't think in the long
run this is gonna affect you know much
of anything the car might run slightly
louder
but you shouldn't see any performance
degradation in the long run with this
configuration here now the unsung hero
of this build is the MP quiet straight
power 11 it's a fully modular power
supply this time around and it's an
excellent quiet under-the-radar power
supply that's exactly how you want a
power supply to be you don't want to
hear it under load this is 750 watt
units kind of overkill for the system
but nonetheless it's it's in an
affordable price point I think for what
you're getting peace of mind the PCB has
literally everything built into it so
there aren't cables you know stretching
from one part of the PCB to the other
because it's so beautifully engineered
so air flow isn't inhibited a single bit
and it's gonna sound extremely quiet as
you might have guessed now I've got a
couple games downloading in the
background this is a full-on new system
so I completely wiped the OS off the old
drive and reinstalled Windows 10 I've
got a hard drive in there you guys saw
the Toshiba 2 terabyte drives actually
pretty quiet I've always gone with WD
but this was a Toshiba Drive that I rip
from an old system and it's staying very
quite actually quieter than WD blues
that I'm used to using so 2 terabytes is
plenty for you know a typical steam game
library maybe not for some of you out
there but if you're just a modest game
or someone who even games daily but
doesn't have a huge library 2 terabytes
there's plenty for that you can always
upgrade later there are two drives in
the 350 X and fantex so upgrades are
gonna be pretty simple in that respect
but I've got a couple games downloading
now I'm gonna check on them and we're
gonna show you some benchmarks see just
how well an i-5 8400 paired with a gtx
980ti performs now the first thing I
wanted to test here was a grand the
thought of 5 as always and what I'm
looking for particularly are very high
usages of either the CP or the GPU you
can see in most scenarios the graphics
card that's right a the overkill 1080 TI
in this rig is actually more or less a
limiting factor here and we do have
quite a bit of the in game settings
maxed out although we are not enabled
anti-aliasing under any circumstance so
it could be much worse for the graphics
card than it is currently and this tells
me that the i5 8400 is plenty for a game
like this also the frame rate is pretty
high all of these games by the way the
OC tested in this video have been
benchmarked in the 1440p resolution
which is a fair middle ground between
maxing out GP utilization and 4k and
leveraging the CPU more in 1080p the
next game I tested was pub G and this
one had me a little concerned at first
because this game
been known to not utilize resources in
the most efficient ways I was pleasantly
surprised though to find that the eye-fi
was actually enough for the system at
least given the current optimization
standards we were reaching anywhere
between 50 and 70 percent utilization
across individual threads there are six
of them keep in mind for this CPU and
the graphics card was also being
utilized around 70 to 80 percent during
this run and I would say that this is
acceptable it's not the best we'd like
to see in a well optimised game you'd
expect these to be both concurrently
around 80 to 90 percent utilization but
this is okay given the circumstances the
current state of pubsey it receives
updates every week it seems like servers
are always down for maintenance so I
expect this game will continue improve
over time but for now the i5 8400
appeared with a gtx 980ti is a viable
option for a game like this rise of the
Tomb Raider was an interesting one
because we benchmarked it in DirectX 12
and I was curious to see how CPU usage
was going to vary running in this API
versus the x11 and I was a bit concerned
at first because at the begin of each of
these benchmark runs there are three of
them in this built-in benchmark CPU
utilization across all six threads maxed
out to a hundred percent and that's
that's not good you don't want to see
anywhere near 100% utilization for CPU
workloads in games that just tells you
that your CPU is the massive bottleneck
in that scenario you can see though our
CPU is running very cool around 44 or 45
degrees Celsius our 240 mill a IO from
deep pool is just severe overkill here
the system remained extremely quiet
apart from the coil one of our 1080 GI
which was again being maxed out anywhere
between 90 and hundred percent
utilization in this game so I would say
that both Europe being utilized heavily
although this is an Nvidia optimized
title I would say that the graphics card
is still being utilized more in the long
run universe and MUX 2 is always an
interesting one to benchmark this is the
earth and sphere of moon simulation when
we always run and in the 1440p
resolution with high presets we are
noticing that the CPU does cripple the
system under just very specific
workloads like when the moons all
collide this requires many calculations
of the CPU has to handle and it does
choke a couple of threads though the
entire CPU utilization isn't maxed out
anywhere near hundred percent during
that specific scenario so the CP is
gonna be a limiting factor here
obviously the GPUs
like being used maybe 30% max so this
one's gonna be definitely held back by
the i-5 but I should note that the the
reality of this doesn't really change if
you jump up to an i7 8700 K this more or
less comes down to an optimization issue
and the last game we tested was f1 2017
I love this game because it's just like
GTA 5 in the sense that both CPU and GPU
horsepower for the most part gonna be
utilized very heavily you can see under
certain circumstances our CPU is
approaching 100% utilization though this
is not you know a lasting thing it's
very temporary and we don't notice any
frame dips when this occurs so I would
say this is probably the most
comfortable I would be with CPU being
maxed out under again very rare
circumstances the GPU is hovering
between ninety and a hundred percent
almost all the time and I would prefer
this even with a 1080i we're pretty much
maxed out in settings here although we
aren't running any anti-aliasing onboard
this is one of those situations in which
I would say we're hitting the upper
limit of what I'd be comfortable with
CPU and GPU utilization wise and the
frame rate is kind of responding to that
too right so we're about 120 to 130 fps
this is great again in 1440p with just a
$200 CPU so in a nutshell I've got to
say I'm I'm not disappointed with the i5
I just know in the back of my hand that
there are a rise in five CPS out there
that are comparably priced that do come
with multi-threading support and you can
actually overclock the CPU as well so
with all that take into account it's
it's difficult for me still to recommend
an i-5 unless you're just purely gaming
we can do a little bit of multitasking
i'm just running nvidia shadowplay while
recording we had a rebus statistics
tuner open to monitor system usages and
that's not you know lightweight by any
means but it's not like streaming it's
not like rendering in the background
while you're playing a video game or I
don't know watching a 4k movie on
Netflix you guys know I'm saying so
doing multiple things that are pretty
intensive at the same time will be
difficult even for a six-course EP like
this because one it's not overclockable
and - it has no hyper threading so the
i-5 in my eyes is a strictly gaming CPU
and I've said that for a long time but
now that I've gotten a tested first hand
with an overkill graphics card like the
1080 Ti I see now why it still exists I
don't think that it should
exist although I still struggle in my
mind again to reconcile the fact that
you have an r5 CPU that's comparably
priced that has much more that's
disposal than this and you only maybe
you lose five to ten frames in most
games at modest resolutions so I still
kind of stand by my statement when I say
that the rise in five CPUs are gonna be
better in ninety ninety-five percent of
circumstances but if you just strictly
game that's all you care about you can't
go wrong with this I mean this is gonna
be within five to ten percent of what an
i7 8700 K can do and it's the king of
gaming so to be able to get something
close to that right in a price point
that's around 200 bucks for a CPU is
pretty darn good and that's what we
expect normally from Intel is that
superior gave me performance but not
necessarily the future proof that you
might want in some like a quad core or a
hexa core CPU with that I want to know
what you guys think would you consider
an i5 8400 in your next rig if you're
already sporting one tell me what you
think about it and if you are
considering in the future upgrading and
if so what to just so I can get a
prospect for what people are looking for
next once they have an i5 is this good
enough for you do you see it as being
good enough for you and what you do
day-to-day on your PC if you like this
video if you appreciate at least a build
