You
could have just nav�d to a few websites
and checked graphs, but you decided to click
on this video and I appreciate that. So we�re
gonna jump straight into it. In this video,
the Ryzen 7 3700X was put through the ringer
in a couple of different formats. First, a
stock configuration bundled with Gigabyte�s
X570 Aorus Master. This was the motherboard
used for our 2700X as well. A separate video
will be uploaded within the week pertaining
to our X470 testing, and then another for
a few B350 and 450 boards with supporting
UEFIs.
The second config for the 3700X included a
manual overclock. How far could I go? Well�
you might be a bit disappointed � at least
with my sample. Seems I didn�t win the silicon
lottery. 4.3GHz at 1.41 volts, a turbo-locked
load line calibration and aggressive VRM preset.
Not much more I could do here, and 4.4GHz
wasn�t gonna happen. But who knows? You
might get lucky! And I�m sure other reviewers
had different albeit similar outcomes.
The same XMP profile was configured for every
tested CPU you see in this video � that�s
the 2700X, 3700X, and 9900K. 3.6GHz for our
16GB kit of dual channel TridentZ DDR4 from
G.Skill. This should be a sufficient combination
of high frequency and low CAS to benefit Infinity
Fabric latency dependencies as they pertain
to both our 2700X and 3700X, although the
implementations are different due to the shift
in architecture and SoC layout.
Our graphics card of
choice: Nvidia�s RTX 2080. This particular
variant is from ASUS and it was reviewed in
this video right here. The boot drive utilized
was a 2TB MP600 from Corsair which is PCIe
4 compatible. The operating system was reinstalled
for each CPU swap to eliminate software and
driver conflicts. And all games were loaded
from a 2TB WD Blue hard drive. Alright. With
all of that out of the way, let�s dive into
the benchmarks.
Here are a couple of synthetic tests for a
frame of reference, first. In Cinebench R20,
our 2700X faired single and multi-core scores
at stock of 433 and 4097, respectively. Not
bad. This is with Core Performance Boost enabled,
which effectively allows these CPUs to reach
rated boost speeds out of the box without
violating power limits. Disabling this would
be the near-equivalent of disabling Turbo
Boost in Intel CPUs. With a manual 4.2GHz
overclock, our single core dropped slightly
(a phenomenon we explained in a previous video.
We�ll put the card here). However, our multi-core
rose to 4223. The 3700X radically improved
things across the board. At stock, things
jumped by 61 points to almost 500 and, when
overclocked, a score of nearly 5000 was achieved.
The 9900K, the previous single core champ,
retains its lead but only slightly at 509.
This is with multi-core enhancement disabled,
by the way. Our manual overclock to 5GHz across
all 8 cores picked things up just a bit, but
it is worth nothing that the 3700X comes awfully
close to matching Intel�s Core i9.
Geekbench 4 was the other synthetic I wanted
to run before games. Here, a similar result
holds. The Core i9 was a bit faster overall
in the single core test, but the gap AMD�s
narrowed here with this launch is definitely
worth nothing.
In 3DMark Time Spy, the 2700X�s CPU score
came back at 8584 at stock, 8857 when overclocked.
A similar margin was observed for the 3700X,
albeit with higher scores overall. Interestingly
enough, the 9900K scored lower at stock than
the 3700X in this test after averaging three
runs. This flip-flopped in our overclocked
scenarios with the 9900K squeaking out a nearly
300 point lead. Had our 3700X been a better
overclocker, I imagine the red team would
have taken this one.
Grand Theft Auto V, while optimized fairly
well, has always been a bit Intel-biased�
however, the tides have definitely turned
with this latest launch. The 3700X averaged
147 FPS at stock, only 12 FPS lower than the
9900K. Considering this title�s inherent
preference for the later, I�d say this is
a pretty darn good result. Frame times indicate
similar degrees of micro-stutter. One thing
I�d call �odd� is the fact that this
game performed significantly better overall
at stock in the case of the 3700X. Our lowest
0.1% of frames averaged 13 FPS lower when
overclocked, suggesting heavy use of one or
two cores. Under such situations, the chip�s
max boost clock of 4.4GHz would come in handy.
Our testing confirms that it rarely hits this
frequency, but the smoothness of this title
at stock is undeniable.
Shadow of the Tomb Raider yielded interesting
results. The 3700X came out on top overall,
but struggled slightly under harsher loads,
hence the slightly lower 95% averages. Ultimately,
side by side, it�d be impossible to tell
these two apart and that�s a good thing
because the 3700X is significantly cheaper
than the 9900K and significantly BETTER than
the 2700X in this particular title.
Resident Evil 2 is next. Here, without a doubt,
AMD CPUs take the cake. In fact, I averaged
higher frame rates with the 2700X than I did
with the 9900K. This is running through the
exact same checkpoints in the game. At stock,
the 9900K really struggled by comparison � although
I doubt anyone�s gonna complain about a
200 FPS average. Overclocked scenarios, by
the way, faired better across the board in
the Balanced preset.
Now another game I like to test because it
struggles constantly with optimization parameters
is PUBG. 1% and 0.1% lows tank hard here and
seeing just how hard they tank can tell us
a lot about how these CPUs handle adverse
situations. The 2700X undoubtedly struggled
a lot. Jumping from 170 FPS down to a mere
24 is a tough pill to swallow, but it isn�t
like our other CPUs faired much better. Intel
won on the lower end with dips that weren�t
as steep overall, but the 3700X kept up and
nearly matched the blue team for the overall
average and lowest 1% of frames. Basically,
what this graph tells us is that all three
chips had infrequent stuttering issues. The
9900K just didn�t stutter as hard for as
long. Is this a deal breaker if you�re a
PUBG junkie? In my book: no.
I tested Fortnite to appease the younger audience.
I absolutely hate this game and only play
it for the purposes of benchmarking, so you�ll
have to excuse my slow mechanics. I landed
on top of the same building every time and
ran the same route. I also tried to sync up
the time of day in-game. On average, the 9900K
edged out a victory, but again, only by a
few FPS. This trend continues to the lowest
0.1% of frames, so I highly doubt anyone would
be able to distinguish the two here � even
with frames being drawn on-screen. I should
also note that our 2700X faired well here
and suffered only slightly among the lowest
0.1% of frames when manually overclocked�
so if you�re a huge Fortnite fan and are
into streaming or the like, the 2700X at a
deep discount may be worth considering over
these more expensive processors. Just food
for thought.
Witcher 3 tends to be more graphically intensive
than anything else with a few exceptions,
and our narrower margins reflect this. Every
CPU faired well in the high preset. The 9900K
came out on top by around 7-10 FPS, but this
is nothing to flip out about when we�re
in the 200 FPS range. Perhaps more importantly�
the lowest 1% and 0.1% of frames. The 3700X
nearly matched the 9900K for the lowest 1%
and fell just shy among the lowest 0.1%. Visually,
you�d be hard-pressed to discern the two.
F1 2017, though a couple of years old by this
point, still exhibits a solid balance between
multi-core and single-core optimization. The
3700X averaged between 175 and 177 FPS on
average compared to 190 and 193 for the 9900K,
although the former absolutely crushed the
latter among the lowest 0.1% of frames. I�m
not entirely sure what went wrong here, but
this occurred several times with no outliers,
hence why it�s being included here.
Universe Sandbox 2�s Earth and Sphere of
Moons simulation wrecks pretty much anything
we throw at it and the case is no different
here. The 9900K averaged 71 FPS when overclocked
but dipped to an average of 18 FPS for the
lowest 0.1% of frames. The 3700X had a lower
overall average, but struggled to the same
extent under the worst conditions � namely
when the moons orbiting Earth first collide.
You can see how sharp the differences are
in our frame times graphs. Obviously, this
was the most intense section of the benchmark.
The higher these plots, the longer each frame
took to render. \
Lastly, Ashes of the Singularity�s CPU benchmark
reveals just how big a difference frequency
can make. 59 vs. 48 might seem small on paper,
but I�d be willing to bet most of you could
see the difference on-screen. The 9900K took
this one with ease� but let�s be real:
how many of you actually play Ashes of the
Singularity?
So that�s that. These were the games I tested.
And the conclusion I�ve come to is: WOW.
AMD�s done a heck of a job with the 3700X.
Power draw is incredibly low. Package power
topped out at around 100W and I was reading
around 6-7 Amps under full load across the
clamp meter. This is a 65W TDP chip, after
all. The 7nm lithography works wonders for
temperatures as well. While gaming, this thing
remained under 70 degrees Celsius with our
Kraken 62 after heat soak and idled well under
40C. The only thing I can really complain
about here is the overclocking potential.
I talked to a few other reviewers prior to
launch and most of them expressed similar
disdain with this. Had we gotten to 4.6 or
4.7GHz across all 8 cores, I�d expect the
3700X to slay the 9900K in nearly everything.
As of right now, however, we�ve got one
heck of an octa-core CPU for a little over
$300 USD. That�ll save you over $100 when
foregoing the 9900K � a CPU that only barely
squeaks out leads in-game� if at all.
Going forward, it�s going to be very difficult
to recommend Intel�s 14nm stuff. The presence
of an iGP is definitely a plus for a few niche
circumstances which we�ll explain in our
productivity benchmark video, but for a majority
of you who game, stream, and content create
with a discrete GPU, the 3700X is an incredible
value. It�s honestly what Intel SHOULD have
priced their latest 8 core CPUs at. But unlike
AMD, who�ve been giving us significant upgrades
and additional cores and similar prices, Intel�s
charged MORE for 
its new 8-core chips� and the reality of
it is� unless they lower these SKUs to levels
that directly compete with AMD�s 7nm 8 core
counterparts, gamers should almost EXCLUSIVELY
consider Zen 2.
