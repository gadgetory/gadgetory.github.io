6900 K for cores and for threads for
cores and eight threads and eight cores
16 threads all with prices to match yeah
I know
so with all of this height behind the
x99 platform Broadwell eat chips and
quad-channel memory is the 6900 k a
logical or insane choice I'll make this
one simple for you rather than trusting
a random person on some forum who may
not even own the processor in question
or a sketchy graph on a not so reliable
website let's look at the cold hard
facts based on reliable and relatable
benchmarking data
I won't waste your time here are the
specs for each platform essentially
Walter white version 1.0 versus Walter
white version 2.0 waltz right version
2.0 is that one right there
30 minutes of I 264 was my stability
baseline and temperatures exceeded ADC
frequency and voltage were adjusted
accordingly that's how we arrived here
both our 66 and 67 hundred K or
overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz at one
point three eight volts and the sixty
nine hundred K was overclocked to four
point four gigahertz at one point three
nine volts sixteen gigabytes of ddr4 at
three thousand megahertz were used for
both tests the only difference here
being that the x99s platform utilized
the quad channel array whereas dual
channel was in effect for that of the z1
70s this is a trade-off between both
platforms and will most certainly be
taken advantage of although it's
unlikely to sway many of these results
these are cpu synthetic tests so each
processor will have two unique scores
one with virtually no background
processes running and the other with
three chrome tabs twitter youtube and
amazon the windows Pandora app and
Nvidia shadowplay all running in the
background since only heavy multitaskers
or renderer should consider anything
above an i-5 it's only fair that we take
advantage of the extra threads packed
into the i7 processors for those of you
also interested in gaming benchmarks
those will be available for you in a
card right here with that
let's analyze first up the typical set
of inch r15 runs the sixty nine hundred
K absolutely wipes the floor with it's
much cheaper counterparts but no
surprise there keep in mind as we
analyze these graphs that the sixty nine
hundred K cost nearly three times as
much as the 6700 K in terms of score
percent decrease with the background
processes running we can see the sixty
nine hundred K was largely unaffected
while the 6600 K embraced a substantial
performance hit 7-zip is up next
extraction and compression takes place
during this benchmark and while the
margins are a bit narrower the sixty
nine hundred K still impressively
outperformed the 6700 K something else
to note an extremely minut degree of
degradation because of said background
processes both the 66 and 67 hundred KS
definitely struggled here for RAW
processing power another grade standard
is Geekbench with the result of version
four score variance changed slightly but
overall we can still get a feel for both
single and multi-core
performance with these three CPUs while
multi-core scores were dominated by the
eight core giant the 6700 K demolishes
the broad wall a powerhouse when it
comes to single core performance a
noteworthy observation for gamers this
undoubtedly makes a 6700 K a better
choice for gaming as most games only
utilize a maximum of four physical cores
currently the 6600 K single core score
is also in the ballpark and arguably a
better bet for those who intend to only
play video games on their PC more on
that in a video right here in terms of
multitasking potential however the 6900
case shows its true colors we
experienced only a quarter of a single
percent decrease in Geekbench scores
while running several programs in the
background in Adobe Premiere Pro I
exported a 10-minute 1080p 60fps file in
the YouTube 1080p h.264 preset and
recorded total render times I purchased
the 69 hundred K primarily for editing
and rendering but was largely
disappointed with these results the 8
quart ship was only a minute and a half
faster than 6,700 K that's only 27% for
a 300% price differential most of this
is due to core optimization the W
premier just isn't there yet and CPU
usage during the multitasking run still
never pegged 90 percent these results
will vary depending on your video
editing platform and its current version
lastly we have handbrake which I use to
convert a one-minute mp4 file into the
MKV format which is free and open source
what you're looking at here are the
conversion times in seconds as expected
the 6900 K finishes in nearly half the
time required by the 6700 K and the 6600
K nearly doubled that time handbrake can
be very taxing when converting
multimedia and that's why we see
consistent time percent increases across
the board the i-5 of course experiencing
the worst of it so now that you've
gotten to experience firsthand the
performance gains associated with a
$1,000.00 processor are you a bit
disappointed so am i I'll be completely
honest about that even after taking the
entire build price into account I still
can't justify the x99 platform which is
why I was against it in the first place
I explain it more in a video right here
now don't get me wrong my workflow
efficiency has definitely increased I
expected that I mean I'm paying $1000
the processor better be pretty darn good
when you start taking into consideration
the price to performance ratios and just
how much more you have to spend on the
platform altogether even if you take the
entire price of the PC into account it
still doesn't justify a one thousand
dollar price tag I do have forty PCIe
lanes good for my to ten 70s and SLI I
do have quad channel memory again
performance gains are marginal I just
don't see it adding up whereas with the
6700 K and a z170 platform you're paying
less overall for the entire system and
you're getting some pretty solid single
core performance in fact some of the
best out there if you look at the geek
bench score of the 6700 K it's in the
five thousands that's definitely a huge
change from the roughly four thousand
score we received our single core geek
bench test and when it comes to strictly
gaming forget about x99 did you get that
forget about x99 take my word for it
you're much better off of the desktop
grade i 5 or i7 again don't waste your
money on anything above an i7 6700 K for
gaming you just you won't reap the
benefits of having extra cores at your
disposal because most games aren't
optimized for six or eight or definitely
ten core behemoths if you liked this
video be sure to give it a thumbs up
give it a thumbs down if you do feel
complete opposite or if you hate
everything about life be sure to put and
subscribe but if you have any stay tuned
for another PC built on the way actually
I expected to be here next week sometime
and I'm doing some upgrades to Walter
white version 2.0 behind me this is
