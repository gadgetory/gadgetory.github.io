studios and minute science did you know
that there is a a moon actually in our
solar system that is a lot like Earth
and more ways than one now this moon is
actually a fairly big moon when you
compare it to like our moon orbiting
Earth this moon is twice the size of our
moon and it also has an atmosphere it's
actually the only moon in the solar
system that we know of that has an
atmosphere if you haven't figured it out
by now the moon is tighten and tighten
orbits Saturn Titan has some very unique
characteristics Cassini made its first
official Saturn flyby in 2004 and it
around the same time that the probe was
taking pictures of Saturn Titan Saturn's
largest moon was catching the satellites
I for more than one reason the first and
most obvious reason is the fact that
Titan has this there's a glow it it's
just hazy and no other moon in the solar
system has this kind of haze like these
clouds cover its surface only planets
you're supposed to have those things
right I mean a moon doesn't have enough
gravity to pull gas around it sound like
whoa what's going on here further
investigation led to the discovery that
Titan actually has liquid on its surface
it's actually the only other object that
we know of that has liquid on its
surface and the Mars discovery that
happened recently I want to see video
proof of that okay we actually dropped a
probe on Titan and found liquid methane
so yeah that's actually what the liquid
was on the moon was methane but it was
so cold and tighten at the methane which
is normally gas here was a liquid and is
still a liquid on Titan another
characteristic of Titan that makes it
very unique in much like Earth is the
fact that Titan actually has active
tectonic plates if you remember from one
of our previous minute science episodes
we talked about tectonic plates and how
those on earth are constant moving back
and forth they're sharing each other
pushing against each other and pulling
apart from each other well the same
processes are actually happening on
titan but for a different reason so
titan doesn't have a very hot
radioactive center not like earth does
very heavy radioactive elements didn't
make it that far out into the solar
system when our star was first born what
Titan has the earth doesn't have though
is a large partner in this case Saturn
and as Titan orbits this planet Saturn's
gravitational pull basically churns all
the rock that's inside of the moon and
this creates a lot of heat a lot of
friction is generated a call from one of
our other mid science episodes and that
heat basically moves these rocks all
around eventually these rock faces
basically led to the creation of
tectonic plates there was so much
friction in the moon that rock face is
actually crystallized and formed solid
plates so Titan has many oceans sounds a
lot like Earth and Titan has active
tectonic plates like Earth these are the
only two places that we know of that
have active oceans and active tectonic
plates but perhaps the most obvious
trait of them all that makes Titan so
similar to earth is the fact that Titan
has a very dense atmosphere but it's the
composition of the atmosphere that makes
it so like Earth in Earth's case
nitrogen composes about seventy eight
percent of its atmosphere but in Titans
case nitrogen composes ninety-eight
percent of its atmosphere the remaining
gases being hydrogen and methane now
obviously this atmosphere is not
conducive to life as we know it but that
doesn't mean that life on Titan couldn't
have formed under different conditions
life here on earth generally respirate
seeeeee oxygen but life on Titan could
utilize methane maybe even hydrogen it's
possible we don't know if it actually is
the case but it's possible the cool
thing about science is you really can't
come to absolute conclusions until
you've analyzed everything about what
you're studying
and the thing about space is it's huge
so we'll never be able to fully accept
the fact that we're alone or maybe that
were not until we've discovered every
planet that there is to discover and I
guess in this case every moon there is a
Discoverer to guarantee that life
doesn't exist or does look all I'm
saying is that if a moon in our solar
system has an atmosphere and lakes and
rivers and streams and geysers and
tectonic plates and a dense atmosphere
what are the odds that just other moons
out there are possibly able to support
life for all we know there could be
planets out there made of cheese and the
other planets made of like sugar or
something we don't know and until we
discover or probably in this case don't
discover planets made of cheese and
sugar we can't say for certain that they
don't exist and that's the beauty of
science in particular that's the beauty
of astronomy this is science studio
