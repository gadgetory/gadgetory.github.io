video this guy tried to sell a system
sporting an i7 8700 K and a 1080 TI for
$6,000 yeah he was he was being serious
in fact he he was being more than that
he was being condescending he was being
an asshole in my opinion and now yet
again he's trying to cover up his mess
by filing repeated privacy complaints on
our videos this is before and after he
threatened to sue us so here's our
response $6,000 cash firm no less no I
will not part out sell separate I will
not take payments EBT PayPal whatever
you have cash money 6k no less just in
case you didn't get it the first time
don't give me any a BS of oh I can build
this and that for this build it yourself
I do not need to sell right you just
have it listed on Craigslist just here
to entertain offers if you don't have
the cash to go to Walley world and buy
yourself a pre-built system for $300 and
have it break in 14 months and cry this
was written by the owner of grace
computers a small company based out of
Fort Wayne Indiana and yes I'm perfectly
within my right to reveal the business
behind this Craigslist ad it was not
hosted by a private seller like some of
you thought businesses are public by
default they must report income to the
IRS they must register in the state in
which they operate and with that
corporate address and phone number I had
to do the same thing here in Florida so
about a week after this video aired back
in April of 2018
I received a series of aggressive emails
and messages on Facebook from the
store's owner demanding that I remove
the intellectual property on display and
his Craigslist ad and thus in my video
now at this point you might be thinking
well yeah Greg I mean you shouldn't have
shown his personal info but he has you
know a certain degree of privacy or
right to privacy
but as he forfeit that right when he
plasters his address and contact info
directly into a public ad if I post my
phone number on Facebook and someone in
turn posted on Twitter does that mean I
can sue them this is what we were
threatened with a lawsuit but before you
jump on the bandwagon not over revealing
his personal info on the
sad there was nothing personal in his ad
this address that you see right here
1920 Bluffton Road which I will read in
a video that's what I'm doing right now
is not a home address it won't lead you
to a residential neighborhood or an
apartment it leads you to a commercial
property operated by grace computers now
look I've got absolutely nothing against
honest small businesses I think they're
vital to an economy like ours some pro
small business if you will I run a small
business as do many of my colleagues
this is our a livelihood and I'm blessed
to be in a country where I can do this
so just freely but when another business
threatens to sue mine for calling out a
condescending ad on a public forum that
contains public information you could
pull from any mediocre search engine I
take it seriously and very personally
the owner of grace computers threatened
science to do multiple times with
lawsuits and cease and desist letters I
didn't announce his stuff in a video I
just talked about it briefly on Twitter
he demanded that we remove his quote
intellectual property let me be clear
the World Intellectual Property
Organization defines intellectual
property as creations of the mind such
as inventions literacy and artworks
design symbols names and images used in
commerce it technically includes his
address but it does not protect the
address itself from being public it just
means that I can't build a computer and
claim that it's being sold at grace
computers 1920 Bluffton wrote he has the
right to sell his goods at his location
that's his intellectual property his
physical address however is not
inherently intellectual property good
luck with that one in court dude what
this ultimately led to is a privacy
complaint after he likely realized he
couldn't actually sue us for anything
viable so he filed a privacy complaint a
few days after the video aired and in
YouTube's case privacy complaints must
be filed by the person who believes he
or she has had personal information and
voluntarily revealed online this can be
an image or voice of full-name financial
information contact information or other
personally identifiable information this
straight from from Google and that goes
back to my point none of this was
personal information because
the only info displayed in the ad and in
our video was business information that
he voluntarily contributed to the
posting that I could look up at any
given second on Google YouTube agreed
with us and overturned his privacy
complaint a few days later but now this
seems like he's pulling a verge here
several months later were hit with
another privacy complaint obviously by
the same business since it's the only
entity that qualifies and containing the
exact same time stamps listed in the
first complaint which was already
overturned I guess they're hoping
YouTube changes their minds and as a
filming YouTube hasn't responded but
based on precedent alone this should go
nowhere so to end this one I want to
make very clear the fact that we do not
take these threats lightly and I think
we handled this situation at the time
the best we could when the owner of
grace computers threatened us multiple
times on Facebook with lawsuits you can
argue the eve and possibly harassed us
we responded with gifs or gifs however
you want to say it one was of Eric
Cartman from South Park eating popcorn
that was it and then we'd get another
huge paragraph response from him in
other words bring it on dude we'll see
you in court
and if and when that day comes we'll be
ready that's all I really want to say
regarding the the issue right now I
don't want to blow this out of
proportion and act like it's equivalent
to a copyright strike because it's not
but being threatened with a lawsuit is a
very serious threat and again we don't
take that lightly I think that we are
well within our rights to do what we did
and you know on principle alone I will
not remove the information not after
being threatened especially and the way
that he handled the situation I thought
was very unprofessional and yeah that
said we don't want any harassment we
don't want you to do anything to this
business I just want you to know this is
what's happening with us behind the
scenes of stuff you don't really see but
look when we're gonna be threatened with
a lawsuit when we're going to have
illegitimate privacy complaints filed on
videos really let you know who did it
and what we're going to do about it in
response I think that's important that
we keep that stuff as public as possible
without being you know overbearing
because I think you guys have a right to
know what's going on with the channel
that you choose to contribute to you
that you choose to watch
so with that let us know what you think
in the comments below I appreciate it
thumbs up if you liked the video I mean
whatever and stay subscribed if you want
to see more scientific content on the
channel this is one of those spin-offs
where I just talk about something that's
happening in real time but this is a
science Channel and I try my best to run
as many tests as possible to entertain
the masses
this is science video thanks for
watching and thanks for learning with us
