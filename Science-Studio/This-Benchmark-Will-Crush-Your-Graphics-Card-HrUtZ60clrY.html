showed you universe sandbox - a game
that could seriously crush your CPU even
my i7 was maxing out at 100% used it at
certain points so now I'm going to show
you a GPU crusher and that is the new
Unigine superposition benchmark now if
you haven't already jumped onto this
bandwagon superposition is a serious GPU
stressor that includes resolution
support for up to 8 K and also VR
support so for anyone sporting an HTC
vive or oculus rift you can now
seriously stress your computer and test
whether or not it will be able to handle
the most intense of VR scenes you can
even interact with and manipulate
specific objects getting this benchmark
a totally new kind of vibe something
that I'm not used to with heaven
benchmark which is also from Unigine but
there's something I should warn you
about regardless of your system
specifications you will be disappointed
with the yielded fps and that's a very
good thing when I run graphics intensive
benchmarks I want the graphics card
being stressed to its limit to simulate
a worst-case scenario which in most
games will not occur but it's still good
to do it's still good to prepare for so
with that I'm going to end this video by
showing you the entire superposition run
with my current rig sporting an i7 6700
K and a gtx 1070 they are water cool but
they're not super duper overclock you
can check the video description for more
details but this kind of combo is what I
imagined quite a few of you do have so
you'll experience a similar framerate in
the long run just prepare yourself it's
not going to be anything crazy at all
this is the 1080p ultra run so without
further ado I present to you the unit in
super position 1080p ultra benchmark
the
for
Oh
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
