five chips pack over seven billion
transistors the number of people here on
earth into a space no larger than a
quarter like why is the GTX ten eighty
from Nvidia Spassky lineup packs the
same number into the size of a penny but
with all of these microscopic or
nanoscopic transistors squeezed into
such small areas there's bound to be a
bit of heat involved in fact some of
these CPUs and GPUs require unique forms
of cooling to keep cool even while
maintaining subpar clock speeds but why
what exactly about CPUs and GPUs makes
them run so hot there's actually more
than one answer to that question welcome
to crash course first let's discuss what
exactly a transistor is picture them
like light switches they're designed to
either allow or prevent electricity from
flowing through a circuit via the use of
a semiconductor thus they have
conductive States and insulating states
and special signals to inform the
transistors of when to act like one or
the other there are entire classes
devoted to just transistor theory I
plenty of friends who have already made
it through the curriculum and they would
probably tell me that this is a very
gross oversimplification but this is all
we need to know for what we're about to
discuss next
so inside processors billions of these
transistors are constantly switching
quote-unquote on and off to control
electron flow through various gates
they're also switching it rates much
faster than overall CPU and GPU clock
speeds although these frequencies are
indirectly relative now if you've ever
taken a class in thermodynamics or just
studied mechanical properties in general
you know that the second law of
thermodynamics is just that a law
everything in the universe has energy
and perfect energy conversions and
transfers are impossible so when
electricity flows through in the case of
a CPU primarily aluminum copper reacts
with other components within the silicon
so it's not generally used the resistive
properties of the aluminum yield energy
loss in the form of heat which is why
any aluminum wire heats up when
electricity flows through it so to be
exact pure aluminum has resistance of
2.6 5 times 10 to the negative 8 ohms
times the quotient of wire length and
cross-sectional area however since
processors are generally small and
electrical pathways are literally
microscopic this is not responsible for
most of the heat produced within the die
as
it would be logical to assume then that
the number of transistors within the die
is directly proportional to the amount
of heat produced right no in fact
sometimes the exact opposite is true
consider two processors the i7 4790k
from Intel and its 6700 K counterpart
both processors contain the same number
of cores and threads but not the same
number of transistors yet still both
processors have relatively identical TDP
s that is the maximum amount of heat a
CPU can generate or GPU can generate
that must be dissipated by a cooling
system this is thanks to several factors
one being the thermal design of the chip
itself where blocks are situated within
the die and also how small the
transistors themselves are even though
there are more of them in the 6700 K
each dissipate less heat smaller form
factor lower resistance lower thermal
design on a sidenote individual
transistors smaller than roughly 5
nanometers about a third of the size of
what we're currently running would
experience a unique effect the spaces
electrons must travel through at around
the size become so small that the only
way they can pass successfully through a
semiconductor is via quantum tunneling
this is a separate quantum mechanical
phenomena that involves the borrowing of
energy at the subatomic level from the
electrons surroundings but more on that
in another crash course so transistor
alternation size clustering and power
distribution all play a role in
processor heat generation and so too
does clock speed every computer
enthusiast knows that overclocking a CPU
or GPU always always results in a higher
thermal output and here's the catch
voltage doesn't have to change on paper
this really doesn't make sense if
voltage ultimately drives resistance
we're talking Ohm's law here and
resistance is converted to heat then a
voltage change of zero should yield a
thermal design change of zero but thanks
to how transistors work clock speed
directly affects TDP here we go as
transistors switch from an active state
to a passive state and back again to an
active one they release Heat
thanks to partial resistance remember so
as clock speed increases so too does the
alternation rate it isn't directly
proportional the frequency of 4k Kurtz
doesn't mean that your transistors are
alternating at four billion times a
second it actually means they're
alternating at higher rates than that
and if you overclock all cores and your
chip equally which you'll have no choice
but to do when it comes to GPUs most of
them have some
thousand course thermal output increases
at a rather obtuse exponential rate this
means that for every factor one of
overclock let's say 100 megahertz heat
is generated at a factor greater than 1
this value varies from chip to chip but
it explains why past a certain frequency
chips become very stubborn and get very
very hot regardless of voltage input
you're essentially asking transistors
within your processor to alternated
rates much higher than they were
thermally designed for so if you wish to
venture any higher than that threshold
typically around 5 gigahertz or so
special cooling systems are required and
remember this is all thanks to the
second law of thermodynamics no system
is perfect everything loses energy in
the form of heat your own body does our
Sun does the earth does in fact the
entropy of the entire universe is
increasing and from the vastness of
galaxies down to the very transistors
powering your computers and phones
you're using to watch this video at this
very moment everything is currently
giving off heat traveling from states of
higher energy to lower energy except in
the case of endothermic reactions again
another video but you my friends are
still very cool now we've discussed
quite a bit in this video after all it
is a crash course so if there's anything
you need a refresher on refer to the
description of this video you'll find a
table of contents and the timestamps
will take you exactly where you need to
go if a quick refresher is in order and
there's nothing wrong with that I know I
speak very fast but that's just how it's
gonna be here on the channel speaking of
which if you like this channel and like
what you saw in this particular video be
sure to give this thing a thumbs up give
it a thumbs down if you feel the great
option or if you hate everything about
life be sure to click the subscribe
button you have everything stay tuned
for a future PC build and more crash
course content because I just like doing
different things every day and coming up
with new topics and taking advice from
you guys and doing stuff that you want
to see be sure to follow me on Twitter
if you haven't already at sc/st Salizar
give me the inside scoop of what's going
down what you're confused about and be
sure to address those issues maybe on a
show like this stay tuned for the next
one folks this is science studio thanks
