March store it's kind of weird making an
ad for myself but whatever it's free
right we have our new t-shirt rolled out
you can purchase it right now doesn't
matter where you live in the world as
long as it's able to be delivered to you
you shouldn't have any problem with it
we do charge 11 bucks for International
shipping which i think is pretty good
for a t-shirt and five bucks domestic
that's here in the US but I want to say
that we don't make really anything on
the t-shirt itself so the t-shirts are
priced at like 15 bucks and through our
supplier we're really making like 50
cents I think that's our cut so we're
not in this to make money we just want
people to enjoy wearing the shirts and
supporting the channel so click the link
the video description tie to our website
science studio and then ford slash merch
there so you can buy yourself your very
own science studio t-shirt so I've had
quite the day building in the be quite
dark Bass Pro 900 white Edition now up
front so I'm very clear about this yes
they are sponsoring this build the
purpose of this build is to make the
case look awesome and for the case to
make the components look awesome so
we're doing a CES white winter themed
build here because why not it's December
and then the north that's winter so
every component for the most part will
be white it's kind of the thing if
you're getting tired of the way builds
whatever okay just look at some of these
builds up here they're red and blue and
whatnot now but white I always like to
go back to you because you can shine any
LED color you want at a white surface
and it will pretty much take up the the
color that you're that you're going for
with those LEDs so it's really nice to
have that kind of mix up there now do
you want to say this is a full-size
tower here it's got all the nooks and
crannies you've seen ads for this case
in the past and I do think it's a really
nice case I don't think it's for
everybody very big you're probably not
gonna use most of the space in here
unless you have either a a ton of hard
disk drives or be a custom loop inside
and we're going with the latter for this
build-out it will be featured in the be
quiet booth at CES 2018 I'm really
excited about this my first build ever
to be shown off anywhere so hopefully it
looks awesome
I want to talk hardware and yes I've
recycled quite a bit of what you're
about to see in this video from past
builds in fact past custom loop builds
because we do so many of them on the
channel you can check out these videos
up here they'll pop every now and then
link to other custom loops we've done
here in science studio now because I
knew so many of them it's difficult to
ask vendors over and over again hey can
you send your components you know this
stuff isn't cheap and that's why it's
more or less like a niche market at this
point it is growing and that's awesome
to see because people get to be very
individualistic when it comes to their
PC builds but it's not a cheap hobby by
any means so it's it's not easy for me
to go out there and buy all the
components myself over and over and over
and the manufacturers not that I blame
them don't want to keep sending new
stuff for every single build so I do end
up recycling quite a bit so what you're
looking at here is the MSI X 299
tomahawk board this is an Arctic Edition
board so it does have a white PCB and
much of this actually blends in
perfectly with the case color white is a
very difficult color to match perfectly
there's different shades of white
believe it or not some are more blue
tinted some were a bit more neutral or
maybe yellow and that's just the the
nature of white I mean you really won't
know until you put them next to each
other so yes the PCB itself is slightly
bluer than the case but the white
accents on the motherboard blended with
the case perfectly so it's definitely a
camouflage of sorts now the graphics
card I'm going with because this is
really only a show build I'm just going
with a single gtx 1070 with a thermal
take water block on it again it's not
like it doesn't really make sense to
pair $1,000 processor with like a 3 or
$400 graphics card but it's gonna look
pretty sweet when it's oriented sideways
here thanks to this coolermaster
vertical graphics card riser and i think
that i'm gonna paint this white yep
there we go painted white now and it's
all just gonna blend in I don't want any
black component in the case at least
that's visible not and that's kind of
the whole theme here it's supposed to be
a winter theme build so it all needs to
look snow white speaking of which if you
know anything at all about the dark base
Pro 900 you're probably wondering what
this basement PSU shroud cover thing is
doing here this is from v1 Tech Hasan
makes these you actually made one to
spec for me I just reached out to him
said hey man I need something for the
dark base Pro 900 I know you make PSU
shroud covers specifically for this case
what can you do for me I have a white
Edition it's gonna be a little more
difficult
to to kind of line up color wise he was
like not a problem
boom next they overnighted it there it
is I mean it's it looks so good in the
case and it matches perfectly to not
only the color scheme but also to the
cutouts and indentions in the case this
guy's like he's got this down to an art
so if you need any sort of customization
at all I do recommend you check out his
channel I did tell him I give him a bit
of a shout out here in exchange for the
PSU shroud but I mean I would do it
anyway like if I was just a casual
builder and I wanted something to make
my case look just a bit different than
the average consumer case I would go
first to v1 tech check out his link by
the way in the video description the
next two things I want to show you were
painted by yours truly I'm just kidding
they were actually painted by Chris from
be quiet he decided to paint a power
supply for this build way in advance
like three months ago in preparation for
this build to be showcased in the be
quiet sweet and Caesars Palace at CES
but also these white silent wings three
fans these look so good and white and I
wish that they offer these fans in white
just on the market I think they would
sell like hotcakes
nonetheless you got to paint them
yourselves now it's not too big an issue
because this is more or less a show
build but be careful if you're gonna
paint your fans make sure you apply the
paint evenly you're gonna add weight to
the fins so that might mess up the
bearings in the long around the family
you louder it might break sooner it's
it's kind of a slippery slope but for
all purposes here I think it'd look
excellent
now well looking at this case you might
be wondering okay where does he plan to
put the radiators what kind of runs as
you expect him to get finished here he's
got a lot of space to work with so we
got to fill it up right we don't want to
the empty space is a huge case that we
need a lot of really cool stuff so I
think I'm gonna have an individual pump
like separate from the reservoir the
reservoir is gonna be mounted to the
radiator in the front we're only gonna
have one 360 mil rad which should be OK
for a single CPU GPU array and the
radiator I'm gonna be using is a white
premature radiator that I've used in
this video right here I could go ahead
and just ask for another white radiator
to be sent but I already have one that's
white and frankly waiting for you know a
month almost to get these components
from manufacturers is because I'm not
actually paying them who they're sending
me one to be cool you know have the
product showcased on the channel takes a
long time I'm just too impatient for
that so I already have the stuff I want
to use I got a teardown my arrow cool
p7c one bill to get to the radiator but
so be it will work with something else
in the future but I've saved what I
believe to be the
for last my good friend Tony from the
YouTube channel virility PC customs
decided to take it upon himself to
create some super sweet white custom
cables for the channel there's a piece
of hair floating where did this come
from look the guy's done this like three
or four times for us here at science
studio and I'm so appreciative of that
I actually know them on a personal level
I met them in st. Louis for an Intel
land fest not and we exchanged ideas all
the time just on the DL like you know
just showing off our builds and whatnot
the guys got a lot of passion a lot of
heart you'll see that on his youtube
channel by the way and I also encourage
you to follow him on Twitter and
elsewhere just to see what kind of stuff
he's working on in the background but
he's made these cables they look so so
good in this build I think that's the
icing on the cake right like you've got
to have a nice custom cable kit for a
custom PC build especially a custom loop
build it just looks strange to have the
stock PSU cables running into your
motherboard and your graphics card and
the like so I believe that's it I want
to say a huge thank you to all of those
who got the bill to where it is today be
choir for sponsoring the entire series
Hasaan from v1 tech for the PSU shroud
and Tony's well for those sexy custom
sleeved cables I'm really looking
forward to finishing this we got the
radiators the tubing the fittings and
the pump to install next and then we
should have a finished product we'll
probably do one more video or benchmark
it just kind of see what you get for the
next two nine nine CPU and gtx 1070 that
is water-cooled maybe an overclocking
guy there's something along those lines
if you are ready for CES let me know by
giving this video a thumbs up I
appreciate that thumbs down for I don't
know want to be a party-pooper that's
cool
should click that red subscribe button
if you haven't already did stay tuned

part two of this build series the winter
themed CES bill this is science studio
