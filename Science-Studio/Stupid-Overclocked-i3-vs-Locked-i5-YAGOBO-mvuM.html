and feelings then so be it and the fact
of the matter is this processor should
not exist which processor am I talking
about the i3 7350 K that's right an
overclockable core i3 from Intel's KB
Lake lineup that you've likely heard of
by now what gets why it's stupid here in
a second but I want to touch on
something else first we've been able to
overclock skylake i threes in the past
and it's still very possible if your
BIOS was archived more on that here but
what made base clock overclocking so
compelling was the price you weren't
being charged a premium for a CPU with
an unlocked multiplier the only
additional cost was a z170 chipset over
an H 170 or be 150 chipset but those
additional features never hurt anyone
and they typically aren't bank breakers
when I first saw that Intel released an
unlocked core i3 I got a little giddy
kind of like the G 32:58 right finally
enthusiast qualities and an affordable
CPU ha right this processor costs as
much as a locked I 5 and I've got a
feeling that isn't the only thing wrong
here look there's nothing wrong with a
core i3 for budget conscious gaming I
get it I've been there it's perfectly
viable but for this price
get yourself an i5 even if the processor
is locked here's why I benchmarked three
processors the i3 7350 K of course the
i-5 6400 and the i3 6100 that's an
unlocked I three locked i-5 and locked
i3 I wanted to run worst-case scenarios
for the 7350 case 2 competitors so I
didn't base clock overclock and I didn't
unfairly leverage the graphics card on
the test bench that the gtx 1070 here
hence 1080p gaming resolutions so the i5
6400 ran at 3.2 vigorous with turbo
boost the 6100 ran at 3.7 and the 70
350k was overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz
cache and thread counts are also listed
here just for reference are you ready so
these games all of them tell the story
at first glance you might be thinking
well Greg the 73 50k isn't far off the
i5 mark at all particularly in the
averages feel free to pause this video
too
closer look at these by the way minimum
slipped a bit further behind on account
of the lack of the two extra physical
cores for the i3 but nothing substantial
caught my eye do keep in mind though
that hyper-threading only goes so far
more on that here I don't want to dive
much into individual game performance
I've done that several times in the past
so I think you have a good clue by now
how each game utilizes resources but the
point I'm trying to make here is that
even if the i3 match the i5 frame for
frame in every single scenario which it
does not the i5 would still be the
better buy think about it we had to push
the i3 73 50k to 4.9 gigahertz it was
not easy and it was running much hotter
than the i5 counterpart a whole 25
degrees hotter on top of that you'll
most certainly need an AI o or beefy air
cooler I managed to pull it off with a
cry rig r1 but this will set you back 80
bucks on its own that combined with the
additional cost of an unlocked
multiplier for the i3 make it a terrible
buy for anyone and everyone point-blank
so the i3 73 50k runs hotter can't keep
up in the real world and is still priced
like an i5 that logic you might think
I'm being harsh I kind of am but I'm
doing it to save you money last
generation stock I 5 outperforms this
thing hands down and the new i5 7400
from kb lake improves upon this even
further but it's slightly higher IPC and
jumping out of the box frequency oh and
for a very similar price some facts do
hurt some feelings and if I offended you
because you happen to buy an i3 73 50k
and I ripped on your CPU in this video I
don't frankly care you should have
bought an i-5 period even if it's a
locked i-5 you'll be much better off in
the long run and chances are you'd spend
less money because the i-5 would require
a beefy cooler like the i3 73 50k would
in order to take advantage of the
unlocked multiplier if you're already
looking to spend around 200 US dollars
on a processor to begin with either
stick with AMD Zen or buy yourself a
true quad-core processor from the blue
team you won't regret it I've got a few
link in this video's description if
you're interested in shopping right now
if you like this video be sure to give
it a thumbs up thumbs down if you're the
complete obstacle to subscribe but if
you haven't already and I'll catch you
in the next video got some homework that
you I cannot wait till the day I don't
have to say that anymore
