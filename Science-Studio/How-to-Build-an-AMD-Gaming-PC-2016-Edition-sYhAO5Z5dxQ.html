two weeks ago I was telling all of you
not to purchase an FX processor period
because then is just around the corner
and we're talking about a CP that relies
on PCI Express 2.0 and doesn't even use
ddr4 nonetheless got the platform for a
very great price and while browsing on
Newegg last week I came across an AMD
sapphire r9 fury for a whopping 280 US
dollars a deal I could not pass up me
being me so I purchased the card got
here today I put the rest of the rig
together today and decided to do a
step-by-step tutorial for all of you
interested in building an AMD gaming PC
not something I would advise for most
gamers but if you're a baller on a
budget you're considering I don't own
aim the FX 8300
100 that's your absolute max you can
spend on a CPU kind of makes sense to go
with an FX 8350 20 II which is slightly
higher clocked and slightly more
efficient in terms of power consumption
but across the board you're gonna get a
full eight cores which will benefit you
in DirectX 12 and thanks to the r9 fury
you build a game in 1440p no problem
maybe a little light 4k as well I
wouldn't say GTA 5 and 4k or battlefield
1 in 4k but you get the point some light
4k gaming too so you're going to be
relatively future-proof I'll show you
the benchmarks in a separate video this
is the step by step build guide here
goes for this build a few things were
compromised and still a few others were
overkill to the max it's just that it's
my fault it compromises the motherboard
in the CPU cooler but I bought this
motherboard from Micro Center for 15
bucks see this video here if you're a
bit curious as to how that happened so
that's my excuse there and it comes with
surround sound audio support and
dedicated graphics something FX
processors don't have built-in it's also
in the micro ATX form factor which means
it'll look really weird in our ATX case
again whatever as for the CPU cooler I
debated whether to use the deep cool
captain 240 X but went for the stock
cooler because I wanted to save some
money and you all know how I feel about
stock CPU coolers oh yeah ah what is
that can you hold the camera with it
what are we doing Greg it's really
complicated or
okay yep mmm yeah okay now for the
overkill first the case it was sent to
me from entities and I just had to use
it I mean it's it's white it's beautiful
and sporting tempered glass on all three
sides for the sake of keeping our budget
in check though I'm listing an NZXT s340
also in the description it's a much
cheaper and it's still beautiful option
more in line with the build like this
the other overkill component is the
power supply I only had a 1000 watt p2
from EVGA on hand and the excuse there
is well I don't know I really don't have
an excuse but I did link a solid 800
watt power supply much cheaper in the
description the graphics card we're
going with the AMD sapphire r9 fury
demands up to 400 watts under the most
strenuous GPU torque your tests when
unlocked so an 800 watt power supply
will keep us well within the efficiency
curve to begin building remove your
motherboard from its anti-static wrap
and place it on top of its box this will
serve as a makeshift test bench /
assembly prop next remove your CP from
its box ours is the FX 8320 II being
careful not to touch any of it spins
align the golden arrow on the chip with
the white arrow on the board lifts the
socket lever and place the chip in the
socket then all you need to do is lower
the retention arm once more until the
CPU is secured in place boom you've
installed a CPU grab a hold of a stock
cooler or whatever cooler you intend to
use and prepared for installation if
you're using a third-party cooler refer
to its corresponding manual for this
whole thing here all we need to do is
latch both ends of the beam underneath
the black mounting points it should look
like these here once both ends are
wrapped around these points rotate the
black lever on the cooler 180 degrees
your cooler should now be fastened
tightly to your CPU and motherboard you
can use it as a handle of sorts to lift
and move your motherboard from now on
it's a better option than touching the
PCB itself the last thing we need to
knock out here is Ram installation
g.skill provided 8 gigabytes into 4
gigabyte variants of their sniper series
ddr3 running at 1866 megahertz these
DIMMs are also linked in this video
description and come highly recommended
referencing our motherboard manual we
need to install these modules into slots
1 and 3 so pull back on their locking
mechanisms orient each module per the
notch in each slot and use force to
insert each I set each a lot there sorry
about that
the clip
on either side should snap into their
locking positions once they've been
properly secured we're finished with the
motherboard for now so set it along with
its box to the side grab a hold of your
power supply at this point if it's
modular it'll come with several detached
cables many of which you'll need to pre
install if your PSU is non modular
everything will be wired directly into
the box to begin with in our case
everything including the 24 pin and EPS
cables is modular with the peripherals
we'll be using in mind grab the 24 pin
and CPU cables to VGA eight pin cables a
SATA cable and a molex cable both SATA
and mullux denote power and data
transfer interfaces modern components
will only use SATA but our cases
integrated fan hub requires a single
molex connector as well you can watch my
review of this case by clicking the card
right here with necessary cables
connected remove the right side panel of
your case and insert the power supply if
you're using NZXT s340 you'll need to
attach a bracket and slide it in
directly from the back using your cases
included PSU screws the box with screws
and tie straps is usually located any
hard drive Bay fasten the power supply
to the rear of the case being sure to
orient it fan side down so long as the
case is adequate ventilation underneath
we should also install storage drives at
this point things become very crammed
once other wiring commences remove your
SSD and/or hard drive from its box and
take advantage of the brackets provided
for an SSD it's as simple as removing
one of the three trays using for
peripheral screws to fasten the drive
and sliding the bracket back into place
held there by a single thumb screw I
didn't throw on a hard drive originally
because I plan to use the one from
Heisenberg for running gaming benchmarks
but I've linked a one terabyte Western
Digital blue in the description which I
recommend for general file storage be
sure to install your operating system
however on the SSD while we're back here
plug in the SATA power and data cable
SATA cables should be in your
motherboards box don't worry about
connecting the other end of this cable
until after we finished installing the
motherboard speaking of which let's do
that next lay your case on its side
keeping track of all cables pull out
your motherboards i/o shield and snap it
into the long rectangular cutout at the
back of the case next to the fan opening
this will take some force and is perhaps
the most frustrating part of PC building
I know hard to believe you'll see what I
mean though next using your CPU cooler
as a handle of sorts gently lower your
motherboard into the case using both the
i/o shield and the include
motherboard standoffs as guides once it
is in place use the included screws to
secure it since this is a micro ATX
board we'll only have to worry about six
screws the larger ATX boards will
require eight or nine now turn your case
back on its feet let's tackle the small
wiring there should be a strand of
cables along the back of the case that
connect to the front IO ports USBs the
power and reset buttons etc our
motherboard doesn't have a USB 3.0
header so we can set this blue cable
aside but we do need to wire our hard
drive LED power button reset button and
power LED leads there should be a header
on the motherboard with corresponding
labels down toward the bottom of this
header isn't marked left - located in
your motherboards manual and connect the
cables to the respective pins I changed
my mind
this is the most frustrating part don't
forget about the HD audio cable either
which plugs into a header on the bottom
left side of this board use the gap in
the pin array as a guide if USB 2.0
cables are present as well and included
with other peripherals or coolers plug
them into their respective headers at
the bottom of the board
lastly pull the SATA cable connected on
one end to your SSD up through a cutout
and connected to a marked SATA hub on
the board if you have any extra drives
connect them to subsequent SATA hubs now
we're ready for the graphics card this
is the r9 fury sporting a 4096 bit
memory bus eight bits in a byte which
means it's capable of up to 512
gigabytes of memory transfer per second
all thanks to sack of all HBM as I said
a bit earlier I found it on Newegg for
280 bucks and have it linked in this
video's description although I expect
they'll be sold out very soon so jump on
that if you haven't already to install
this card remove the two shields on the
back aligning with the first full-length
PCI Express slot it's the only one on
this motherboard push back on the latch
and slide the graphics card into place
you should hear a firm click when it's
fastened appropriately then take the two
screws you removed from the back and
while holding the card upright screw
them back into the rear of the case they
should keep the card relatively flat
versus slanting downward while connected
to the motherboard now it's time to
route power cables to the graphics card
and motherboard start with the VGA
cables we needed two of them for this
particular card as it's rather
power-hungry funnel them through the
rubber grounded cutout over the basement
and connect both to the two eight pin
headers on the r9 fear
they should click once they're fully
inserted do the same for the 8 pin CPU
cable will only need one half of this
for this particular board it isn't the
greatest overclocker but 15 bucks I'm
not complaining funnel the 24 pin cable
through as well and connect it to the
large header on the board again wait for
the click that's how you'll know when
it's properly secured with that turn the
case back around and cable manage as
best you can take the time to verify
that no peripheral is left unplugged as
well I almost forgot the molex fan hub
connector use tie straps and zip ties to
route cables accordingly spare no
expense especially in a case like this
with a see-through panel especially on
the right hand side which is rather
unorthodox even though it will likely be
facing a wall it's good practice in
general once everything's tidy reapply
both the front and rear panels clean up
any blemishes connect it to a surge
protected outlet and give it a go
so there you have it folks I hope you
enjoyed the build log if you have any
other questions or concerns be sure to
leave those in the comments below I I'm
not sure what I'm gonna name this PC I
don't think it's gonna last very long
I'll probably put it up on Craigslist or
something and try to sell it for what I
paid for basically I don't really think
that I'm going to keep it around very
long but I do want to test the r9 fury
in Heisenberg I think it'd be
interesting to see how much better or
worse Heisenberg fares with an r9 Theory
versus at single gtx 1070 so I think the
1070 is a more powerful card but in
DirectX 12 that margins shrink and if it
does by how much so interesting videos
on the way
thanks for watching the build blog be
sure to give this video a thumbs up if
you thought it was cool give it a thumbs
down if you do feel the complete
opposite or if you hate everything of my
life I had too much sugar in my coffee
this morning be sure to subscribe if you
haven't we - stay tuned for those
benchmarks I was just talking about this
is Salazar studio thanks for building
