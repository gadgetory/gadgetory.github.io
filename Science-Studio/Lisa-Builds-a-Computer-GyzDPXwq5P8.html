sponsored by be quiet featuring their
new silent bass 801 it's powerful stance
and silent design make it perfect for
today's build the chassis can be
inverted for a unique aesthetic sound
damping material is literally everywhere
and three included appear wings to fans
keep things cool and quiet under load
let's see how well Lisa handles this one
he told me to stay here because over
there are cheeses and he didn't wanted
you to see so instead I'm gonna show you
our components this is our motherboard
or graphic card our power supply and the
AMD processor of course we have orange
black built today because that matches
for the be quiet case and let's see how
it's gonna turn out okay let's see I
have to find oh yeah the little arrow so
I know right
ok I guess so oh yeah you can't help me
to do this board because when I first
time building my PC I put like a lot on
it is that okay yes it must be good now
it's time to complain in the comments
below
you're gonna go today with the Box
cooler because the be beautiful right
yeah it's actually pretty heavy and from
all that I remember these in full
plastic CPUs you would never use them
right for a PC build a plastic vivianne
classic fans
yeah with a small little plastic fans
it's gonna be if you do it right swing
it all around
almost got it oh I'm always scared I
don't want to break things well it's
it's on there now yeah yep
you can't help me with that I know that
he's pulling up pull over here there ya
go
if you notice on this board you can see
it says ddr4 for ddr4 two three and one
so want to do one into first first one
without breaking out you noticed I'm
shaky black and orange is looking pretty
sweet right about now I think I need
some biceps hmm right I like doing it
this way so this crews are not
disappearing and this motherboard has an
integrated backplate so there's no need
to push one into the case beforehand you
want to use the CPU cooler as kind of
like a handle don't don't hold them
forward cuz you're gonna have to push
the board against the case okay okay
okay
I totally get it like it feels kind of
sketchy but that's it's a conventional
way to do it I mean if you're not used
to building a PC like all the time and
then you super sensitive with everything
okay now I got him this table is perfect
perfect height to build a toy path you
want to do that for me Pat yeah this
one's HD and it's young
you know you're impressed I'm I'm
impressed
yeah that's for the fan hood yes okay
also just kind of side note here a
thousand watt power supply is severe
overkill for the system we're putting
together so you could actually get away
with something as little as maybe 450 to
500 watts believe it or not
Rison is actually very power efficient
and the B graphics card when he uses
also fairly efficient so total system
power consumption under heavy load
shouldn't exceed I'm expecting three
hundred and fifty watts maybe 400 or
case so optimal wattage for power supply
would be around 600 watts we're just
going thousand watt here because well
it's really all I have on hand and I
really like using these custom sieve
cables from cable mod so that's kind of
why we chose what we did but we'll link
a more affordable or reasonable power
supply in the video description
all right that's the graphics card
sideways okay I think I have to check on
the video this is gonna work so we have
seven slots that I think I have to
unscrew everything
yeah good-looking in it that's beautiful
and is lacking orange right so it's
gonna fit perfectly with the rest of the
goodies in there really short you see I
came home
one cool thing about the solid-state
drive is that it actually doesn't make
any noise so if you want to have a quiet
system you should probably go with the
SSD
this is take 20 push and go
the OBC is not really hard but making
look unique that takes time let me tell
you cable management well it needs some
practice because for the first time I
did this actually I when I back then
fill it up you see it didn't really look
in the back organized at all so Greg
gave me some advice how to probably
cable management and yeah that's the
outcome so I think she had a lot of fun
again honest I was pretty anal about the
cable management I try to keep that as
clean as possible at the rear you know
building a piece like she said it's
pretty straightforward but when you want
to turn it into a flume apart you gotta
take your time just a little bit I
really like the black and orange color
scheme more so than I thought I would
again thanks to be quiet for sponsoring
the video of sending this case for us to
build in a gigabyte for sending the gtx
1070 still a perfectly viable graphics
card in late 2018 by the way check out
this video if you have your doubts and
looking forward actually using the
system in the field it's just kind of a
silly phrase because I'm actually just
gonna be using it here in the office not
really in the fuel but yeah you guys
like this video you know what to do
thumbs up thumbs down for the ops of
feeling I'll be everything of my life
like that red subscribe button reinstate
tuned for more content like this
this is science studio thanks for
building with us
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
