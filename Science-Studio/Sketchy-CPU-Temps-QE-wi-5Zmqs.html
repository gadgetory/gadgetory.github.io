community is that a system which calls
itself using a liquid must be more
efficient and therefore more powerful
now obviously this isn't true you could
liquid cool a graphing calculator not
much what happened but why then do so
many computer enthusiasts opt for water
cooling solution and better yet why do
CPUs and GPUs they take advantage of get
so hot think of it this way
almost all desktop great CPUs run hot
under load just a fact of life that we
all deal with Intel does offer laptop
grade chips and chipsets like the Atom
Bay Trail lineup but these are
significantly underpowered and
underutilized and even they get fairly
warm so why well it all has to do
believe it or not with thermodynamics
the first law of thermodynamics states
that heat is a form of energy and that
all forms of energy can neither be
created nor destroyed but rather
transformed into other forms of energy
ie
electrical energy to mechanical energy
and vice versa the second law of
thermodynamics states the entropy that
is the randomness of any cycle is always
greater than or equal to a factor of
zero this means that the disarray or
inefficiency of a cycle cannot be
reversed only restricted to zero or
expressed as some value greater than
zero so what do these two have to do
with your computer
well first off keep in mind your
computer when powered on is always going
to be hotter than it was when turned off
in at room temperature essentially the
second law decrees that your computer
will never be 100% efficient and that
energy losses in the form of heat are
inevitable so when you push that power
button and fire things up some amount of
electrical energy supplied by your PSU
will not make it to your CPU or graphics
card on top of that a lot of energy that
does make it to your CPU and GPU will be
dissipated as heat as your chip
processes data if you were to hold a
thermal scope up to your computer tower
or laptop you'd likely notice a vast
majority of heat coming from one of two
places either your central processing
unit or your graphics processing unit
but why in particular do these two get
the hottest while processing units have
a bunch of transistors packed inside of
them imagine them as switches switching
from an on state to an off state over
and over again and in between each
switching process there's a point at
which each transistor acts like a
resistor so when a single transistor
inside of a CPU is in the on or off
state
current flows with relatively low
resistance and now much heat is
generally dissipated but as the
transistor switches between the two
states a current semi flows through it
acting more like a resistor than
anything else this is because the
current travels partially through metal
and partially through air resistors are
designed to do one thing reduce the
amount of current supplied Ohm's law
denoted by the equation V equals IR can
be re-expressed as I equals V over R
where power or current denoted by I is
directly proportional to the voltage of
V supplied and indirectly proportional
to the resistance R applied as
resistance in any current increases the
total current flow must decrease now
recall the first law of thermodynamics
since energy can neither be created nor
destroyed the part of the electrical
energy that was eliminated from the
circuit by the series or parallel
resistors present must be converted into
another form of energy since there is no
mechanical or chemical work to be done
the electrical energy that was resisted
by the resistors must convert into heat
so in your CPU each switching stage
inside of every resistor produces heat
and there are over 1 billion transistors
inside of each Intel Haswell processor
as you may have also deduced by now the
number of times the transistor switches
between its on and off States is also
directly linked to how much heat is
given off if transistor a and transistor
B are entirely the same and transistor a
switches more times per second than
transistor B as long as the same current
is applied to both then transistor a
will consequently release more heat kind
of cool huh well maybe not in practice
but in theory it's pretty neat
now when overclocking CPU or GPU you're
essentially increasing the number of
electrical pulses that each transistor
receives this increases the number of
switches between the on and off states
and therefore increases the total heat
output this is why so many overclocking
computer enthusiasts insist on
installing water cooling units water has
a very high heat capacity and therefore
is capable of transporting large amounts
of heat without changing its own
temperature very much at all so there
you have it
CPUs and GPUs get hot because of partial
resistance and therefore often times
require unorthodox measures to keep them
within their operating temperature
limits and I say I'm Orthodox because
while electricity and water
generally don't work well together it's
kind of cool nowadays to see computers
and their builders utilizing such
opposing forces for greater good
