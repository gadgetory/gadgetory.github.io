computer's telling me we're good so I'm
going to assume that we're good and I'm
watching myself in the live stream and
trying to verify that it is indeed ready
to rock by the way for those who are
wondering about the why is this camera I
feel like whoops I feel like the cameras
like zoomed in like really far back in
order to get this in the shot for those
were wonder about the live stream or the
live stream the giveaway the the two
graphics cards that were giving away to
international viewers as well as the
full-on PC build sponsored by gigabyte
and Animax those announcements those
winners will be announced I what is the
day let's go ahead and uh belay I've had
a few people ask me and I'm like look I
don't even remember what the I don't
even know what the I don't know what the
date is on those so let's just go to
videos here and let's just see how are
we doing what's going on folks if you
guys are doing awesome
I see zombie civvies I see what's up a
to pan what's going on you guys we were
just chatting in our bi-monthly hangouts
chat if you want to be a YouTube member
it's like one of the things that I try
to do to make you guys feel more special
feel like you're getting something for
your money which I appreciate by the way
you won't under no obligation throw
money at me but I'm certainly not gonna
say no and I want to try my best to make
you feel like you're getting something
for it so thanks to those who were in
the chat it was awesome we had more
people this time than last time which is
an improvement and the time before that
we had nobody so I will admit that was
the first time we ever did it so not
many people think about it but I did
make the announcement and the YouTube
whatever feed so you can target members
specifically kind of like you can do
with patreon like tears and stuff anyway
I wanted to check the giveaway date
let's do that real quick so if you click
on giveaway date I'd see let's click the
giveaway link first that would be
helpful and it says it should says the
giveaway
and what day is it
Oh three days left okay so what the
sixteenth is it thirteenth now yep so
the sixteenth is when you guys will know
who won and I mean look your odds are
gonna be low I'm not gonna sugarcoat
that what their their odds at least you
got something you got something let's
see here someone saying I'm too quiet so
I'm gonna turn myself up if I peek it's
your fault just saying I'm turning
myself up because I am like in the
yellow solid yellow I was before now I'm
like almost in the red so anyway if you
guys complain about it I will try to fix
it so let me know how it sounds now but
let's see ah this many weights is by
weekly meeting every other week yeah
that's what I meant then bi-weekly is I
was looking at that inside out I'm
singing bi-weekly meant twice a week
yeah that makes more sense anyway yeah
that giveaway video is up on the channel
if you want to check out how to enter
and you haven't entered yet there are
two chances to win for international
viewers and there is a single chance to
win a full on a PC for lower 48 can
continuous 48 whatever you want to call
them continental 48 US so if you live in
Hawaii or Alaska you count as
international but the good thing is you
have two chances to win the
international giveaways and those are
graphics cards and to be honest if we
just look at my demographics from the
channel about half of you are us-based
and the other half of you are not so
technically international viewers have
twice the odds that US viewers do
granted the u.s. viewers have a chance
to win something much more valuable so
that pcs at least a thousand bucks
probably a little more than that there's
a twenty seventy in there and a ninety
700k that's already like a thousand
bucks on hostess so it's over a thousand
dollars worth of parts and that PC but
there's only one chance to win that for
obvious reasons it's one PC graphics
cards easier to split those up so one of
those going somebody in some other part
of the world and the other ones going
somewhere else and some other
who knows maybe two people from the same
country when I have no idea by the way
I've had like a few people from India I
don't know why specifically Indians
we're asking this but if you live in
India and you are curious as to whether
or not you are valid to enter the
giveaway the answer is yes you can enter
the giveaway you are international by
definition I actually defined it in the
video so just feel like felt like I need
to point that out a few people from
India are asking that question so yes if
you are not in the lower 48 you are
international you are eligible if I can
get you the PC or well not a PC I expect
to be able get it to you in the 48
states but if I can't get you to
graphics cards for whatever reason maybe
like DHL or USPS or UPS or FedEx will
ship to your country or your specific
city then we'll work out something else
maybe we can just send you a cash
equivalent or something like that so
yeah that's really extent to the
giveaway thing I will have a video
coming up very soon to recap that and
also to announce the winners we're also
gonna be upgrading the giveaway PC with
some spicy cable mod cables so you guys
stay tuned for that you know how how
much I love them custom cable specially
yeah the money for it alright Seeger I
am Groot says I'd science to do for
1440p gaming with 1080i which is n to CP
would recommend I'd say 3700 X that's
what I said in my review I think that
there's Evan X is the best so far the
best value CPU for gaming but the 3600
would also be one to consider because
you're gonna get almost equivalent 8700
K performance out of that ship for 200
bucks but because you have a 1080 T I
would say go a little go a little up
because you can be a little more
future-proof although I hate that term
and copy yourself 8 and 3700 X which i
think is an incredibly good CPU for the
money alright so yeah let's talk about
that let's uh let's let's recap I did
see a super chat real quick let me get
that one I see r AP I don't know if Soto
what's up Soto $1 9 a super chat all
right thanks for the be 350 video no
problem thanks for watching I hope you
enjoyed that and if you're curious I
have the a320 video up now so we
actually got a 3900 X to work on an a320
motherboard so there's there's also that
video if you're interested anyway yeah
glad you enjoyed that and what's up max
stennheiser says it's the aboard grit
all caps what's going on max good to see
you yeah let's recap risin risin we'll
send two now once a risin - its really
risin three Zhen - it's confusing rise
in three thousand let's recount 3,700
accident 3900 X what do I really think
no one cares asked a good question we'll
start with that 3,700 X or 3,800 X I've
had quite a number of you actually I
especially on Twitter which is where I
want you to guys I want you to ask
questions on Twitter if you have a
question about something or you have an
issue with the part or whatever you can
ask the question directly on Twitter to
me I will see it I go through every
single notification so I'll see what you
tweet to me or you can address the
question in discord and not just me but
many people will get to see it and chime
in so if you want more than one
viewpoint if it's an opinion maybe I
suggest doing it on Twitter or on disk
or excuse me
our public discord is linked in the
description it's a permalink and then
you could also Facebook message but I
don't really go through facebook
Messenger a lot it's just there so like
it's just kind of a clutter there and
usually people write really long message
is a good thing about Twitter is like it
forces people to condense their
questions so it's better for me it saves
me time I can't afford to be a you know
what's the word I'm looking for
not client I can't afford to be I can't
advise everybody all the time on their
PC needs so my my go-to is asking on
Twitter because it's condensed I can
usually get through them pretty quick
sometimes I can even answer in one or
two seconds so that would be you know
something really really easy for me but
it also give you the feedback that I
hope you're looking for John Cruz Cruz
Krauss I hope I said that correctly but
welcome to the member squad John if you
are a member you can join us every
second week and fourth week of the month
on Saturday right before these live
streams and that way you can get more
one-on-one time with me so we just had
one of those calls on hangouts and like
four or five was in there we're just
chatting it up for an hour so it's a
cool way to just be a little more it
sounds sexual I don't mean it to sound
sexual but it's a good way to be more
intimate with those who feel like you
know throwing money at me basically
there's no other way to put
I mean it's like five bucks someone that
I think we get like three dollars and
fifty cents of that so it's not
something I really promote a lot but the
button is there if you're interested I
appreciate that anyway back to the
question I see Bob Flanders let me get
to that in just a second I want to
answer this question first 3,700 X to
3800 X might this is this is my my
perspective on that the 3,800 X has a
slightly higher boost frequency a
slightly higher max boost overall which
means that under certain scenarios
assuming you have a board that's capable
of pushing these kinds of frequencies
with an appropriate amount of power
delivery that's stable minimum voltage
ripple you want low enough temperatures
and a steady enough current supply that
you can maintain higher boosts for
longer then you should in theory have a
better CPU at stock with a 3,800 X now
how much better does 200 megahertz
justify a 30 40 50 actually in this case
upwards of $70 price Delta in my opinion
the answer is no and that's why I think
ambi decided to to source out and to
send samples of the 3700 X and the 3900
X not the 3800 X and 3900 X it sounds a
lot better to say hey we got eight cores
16 threads 4.4 gigahertz max boost for
329 bucks sounds a lot better than
saying hey we have eight cores 16
threads max boost of whatever the 18 or
3800 X's a 4.5 4.6 max boost whatever
for 399 basically 400 bucks sounds way
better at 329 right and really you're
paying for a slightly better bin chip
because that's why they can boost
slightly higher right I can handle the
frequencies higher and lower voltages
and so you have that trade-off but is
again it does that justify of $70 Delta
in my opinion no Ally the discord link
is perma permalink in the video
description everything that you need is
in the video description that's why the
video description exists but yeah so in
a nutshell I do not think that the 3800
X is justified at a $70 price hike now
if it came down to 350 and then we're
talking 20 30 bucks different story
I might say yeah the 3800 X is great and
look it's the cost of a cheap CPU cooler
to upgrade that's my opinion I think
that it's just a little too expensive
right now to just
by the small performance Delta and
you're only gonna get from a 200
megahertz difference in boost frequency
per across one or two cores most
typically how it scales
I don't you're only gonna get maybe like
five extra FPS if we're talking about a
game that's already playing at 120 or
130 FPS does that $70 really make that
much sense in the CPU side no in my
opinion take that extra 70 bucks saved
when you forego the 3800 acts in favor
of the 37 decks and spend it on a better
graphics card does that make sense to
you that's the difference between two
twenty sixteen to twenty 70s the reverse
between a rx 580 and Vega 56 as a
difference between a gtx 1070 of gtx
1080
right so you could spend your money in
better places if you want a game even if
you're just content creating i would say
that saving the money is a better option
you can get a way better cooler have a
quieter system you could get more ram
you can get a better motherboard there's
a lot of stuff you could do with 70
bucks and i don't think you should throw
it all into a cpu basket where you're
only getting an extra 200 or so
megahertz of boost so yeah sorry about
that someone said the camera is focusing
on the microphone so i'm gonna move that
out of the way actually just lock i'll
just go ahead and lock the focus sorry
about that guys let's click on video
capture device let's pull up the video
configure right or focus yeah auto yeah
turn that off
yeah that's not focus let's get it way
back that's better apply okay and we're
gonna lock it okay shouldn't focus
anymore
sorry about that and i know that it's
like a webcam so like the quality's not
that great but i this isn't supposed to
be like a super hardcore you know fancy
stream i'm not really into that it's
just a live stream you guys are just
here to hear me talk and to chat it up
with me so yeah Cam's gonna be blurry
that's just because it's a cheap webcam
again for hustler maniac we also had
another member I wanted to point that
out I just saw that someone became a
member here was a hustler maniac 85 is
actually you what's going on hustler I
appreciate the membership again hangouts
we have dedicated streams basically
where you guys can call me and
talk to me for an hour before the
livestream we chatted it up before so
yeah hopefully that's something that you
feel like is allowing you to get some of
your money is worth a tube in that $3 20
cents super chat 3:20 F's for that pour
a through 20 board from yesterday's
video got pretty toasty but you know
what what I was surprised buying that
and what that motherboard is that the
VRMs themselves like the MOSFETs in
particular really didn't get that hot
the chokes did but again like I said in
the video the chokes are not like it's
just like a bunch of powder and copper
like they're it's a it's it's not
anything that I would be concerned about
I checked several sites that confirmed
including one of them was actually
hardcore overclocking that guy knows his
stuff like he does tons of motherboard
of use and he looks specifically a power
delivery and even he said that the
chokes you know he who cares Joe if
chokes are like at 150 C then chances
are other stuff on that board is about
to die but it wouldn't like the chokes
themselves would be concerned about so I
was probing chokes just because that was
like an obvious place to look at through
the IR thermometer but the MOSFETs
themselves at least according to that
fluke meter really weren't that hot so
that just tells me again the board was
kind of throttling yourself it was the
board throttling power because it can't
handle huge amounts of power delivery
it's a a320 board what do you expect
right let me get up to the other super
chat here from Bob Landers looking on
Bob Flanders $7.00 $0.77 super Chad's a
good number appreciate that Bob hi Greg
how are you doing 3700 X or 3900 extra
place of 4790k what motherboard make
make believe money doesn't matter okay
all right so here's I'm kind of gonna
summarize again my 3900 X review because
I what I really wanted you guys to take
away from that comparison was that for a
vast majority of you 12 cores is kind of
pointless it's something that I think
AMD says well there's probably a market
for it in fact they know there's a
market for it that's why it exists but
that market is small so the ways that
we're going to counteract that and kind
of bring this into mainstream because
it's not a consumer-grade chipset right
it's on aim for it's not the red
repartee more the way we're gonna
counteract this is twofold first off
we're going to make it available on the
consumer
chipset which is incredible the fact
that we could even run that on an a320
board which we confirmed on this channel
in the last video is awesome but then on
top of that the fact that they're only
gonna charge for Nana and I on saying
like only five hundred dollars like
that's a lot of money but for 12 core
CPU think about how much we had to spend
for a 12 core CPU six years ago right
499 dollars is peanuts compared to what
that stuff used to cost especially at
those frequencies usually when you buy
those high-end Xeon CPUs either they're
locked or they have low base frequencies
like really we're talking like 2
gigahertz low right because for servers
you don't need a really fast process you
just need a process with multiple cores
for vm's or whatever you happen to be
doing so the fact that they made a main
stream I think was the point they just
wanted to say look this is what we're
able to do and yes we think people will
be able to use 12 cores there are
certainly cases out there for them but
is it something that we expect many many
people to buy just because whatever just
because they want to have 12 cores no I
don't think so
I I don't think that they went to this
expecting the 3900 next to be the best
seller obviously lower price chips are
going to be way more appealing to the
masses the 3630 300x is gonna be an
incredible cpu from a value perspective
it already is a few reviewers have
already confirmed that we're gonna get
our hands on a sample here this week so
stay tuned for that the other issue that
I'm sure some of you are wondering about
is is the gaming scenario and the the
being future proof right so that was why
I was sure in that video to show the
streaming capabilities of both of the
3700 acts and 3900 acts and to show you
that the deltas so like the the FPS lost
the percentage loss on the streamer side
frame rate was really about the same so
if you have a CPU that is really
saturated let's say we have our 3,500
X's totally saturated from streaming and
gaming right or let's say it's totally
saturated already from just gaming so
let's say GTA 5 is using all 16 threads
which it doesn't let's assume for the
purpose of this argument it does if it's
using all six threads or a 6-3 if it's
using all 16 threads then if you decide
to stream on top of that you're going to
see a harsher cut into your streamer
side
right that's because the CPU is already
being essentially choked from the start
when you add more of a workload on top
of it it's going to compound itself and
you're going to see the CPU make serious
compromises in your framerate now if you
have some breathing room let's say you
move from the 3700 X up to the 3900 X
and now all of a sudden you have four
extra cores and eight extra threads that
are just kind of hanging out and GTA 5
is not using those then you would see a
smaller margin a smaller drop in overall
performance in game a lower frame rate
drop ultimately because that CPU isn't
being choked from the start now GTA 5 is
not a good example of this because GTA 5
is it's you saw in in the benchmarks
some of those threads weren't being
utilized at all so don't take this at
face value I'm just using it as an
example here the issue though with the
argument that well the 3900 X is better
for streaming is that it really only
applies to a certain number of games
very few games are going to saturate
eight cores let alone twelve so if you
can find a game that you play a lot
let's say you exclusively stream shadow
of the Tomb Raider which did happen to
use a good extent of the threats that we
threw into the 1300 X was I would say
relatively saturate they're not fully
saturated but every thread for the most
part was at around 50% or more
utilization which means that you could
use more cores to offset workload from
single cores and in theory with an all
core overclock benefit to an extent I
don't recall if the shadow the Tomb
Raider benefit from a manual overclock
or not but if it did it wouldn't be a
serious benefit I wouldn't think so with
that in mind then you can you could
probably make the case for the 3900 X
but because our results in GTA 5 at
least showed that the 3700 X lost the
same percentage of frame rates that on
average and across 1% of 1% Lowe is if I
recall correctly again that 3900 axle
lost then you could just say well the
3700 X is good enough because I'm losing
the same percentage of framerate so my
my loss what I'm foregoing let's say I
lose 10% of my average framerate right
for the entire stream then I'm losing
10% on 3900 x2 like I'm saving a hundred
and eighty bucks
to to literally have the same
performance impact that a $500 CPU would
have so my justification is for the
3,700 X even for streamers because a
core is still future proof that's
something that AMD is certainly trying
to change they're trying to make that
consumer grade now and they're trying to
make you I mean its consumer grade but
they're trying to make it the standard
now and you can tell by the way they're
aggressively pricing their products
right I mean they're making eight cores
attainable to the masses and that's
that's difficult that's something that
Intel surely hasn't done at this point
yet I would be great if they did and
maybe Intel will follow suit maybe AMD
will pull Intel under that ring and then
you'll notice that AMD well it
flip-flops right it used to be time when
AMD was awesome and then kind of
flip-flopped and then Intel made the
superior product and then until it kind
of got slow they got sloppy they didn't
have to be competitive because they
weren't being competed with and then
anybody comes back and says yeah well we
got this stuff now and then look oh
we're improving it and then all we
improve it even more and what do you
know we're basically neck-and-neck with
you and our prices are more competitive
than yours
hahaha oh and power consumption we also
went to the power consumption front too
we might not be the best overclockers
but we're giving our consumers ninety
five percent of your performance and
seventy percent your cost
isn't that awesome so my yes Daniel to
answer your question my answer is the
3700 X just a better body it's the best
buy of any eight core or twelve core CPU
on the market today if you want to buy
new there's a case for the 2700 X at a
deep discount there's also a case for
the 1700 X at a deeper discount but
again you are losing performance on
account of the node change also the fact
that the clocks are lower and you you
might lose support elsewhere like
extreme memory profiles things of that
sort
if you drop to be 350 or X 370 excuse me
so Santi access doesn't the extra for
course helped a lot in the streaming
side no I just answered that question
rewind the livestream I just talked
about that so but the CD turfy so with
all this said who would you say that
they're gonna Texas for I said it in the
video I would say 3900 X is for heavy
productivity minded people
if you I mean a nutshell if you use
products that take advantage of the core
counts you could run a VM you could in
theory you could run multiple VMs with
this with this chip this 12 courtship
and you could potentially turn it into a
heavy streamer renderer and gamer all at
the same time there's a lot of stuff you
could do but how many people are
actually doing those kinds of things
right if you do a lot of coding and
compiling things of that sort that I
really don't dabble in then there's a
case for it
productivity workloads that utilize 12
cores if you're doing DaVinci Resolve
work right AMD chips especially higher
core count AME chips benefit greatly in
DaVinci Resolve and so it really depends
on the program on the platform I tried
to emphasize this in the video I said
from my use case I thought that in
Premiere Pro the 99 hundred K was still
the better bet I tried to show that in
my benchmarks and that addresses some of
the criticism that I got especially on
Twitter are not Twitter skews me in the
comments section of course it be in the
comment section of you too it's kind of
a it's a mixed bag but most videos in
the comment section with the ones that
typically fare up top or a lot of people
agree hopefully are positive comments if
they're not then I probably did
something wrong or you guys see some
kind of conflict or whatever like I'll
address it and I'll probably end up not
doing videos like that again if I get
that kind of negative feedback but in
this case I just I I kind of ranted a
bit on Twitter because I had a few
people point this out there are ways to
do it constructively there there are
ways to do constructively I thought that
I had a tech tuber who was constructive
and the way he addressed it I felt like
I was constructive in my response
essentially he thought that it was a
weird test to enable Hardware encoding
in a situation in which you know it's
very it's very specific and my answer to
that is well that's my workload I I'm
going to test workloads that I'm
familiar with because I can explain them
better I said that in the video also
because other people I expect are in
similar situations they are also
rendering they are also you know warp
stabilizing in
premiere premiere is a very popular
albeit annoying at times platform for
video editing and it's just the one that
I've used for a long time I've been
wanting to switch I have switched
somewhat on my mobile side I use DaVinci
Resolve every now and then it's
difficult to adjust to but it's also not
difficult because the functions are
essentially the same they're just in
different places so yeah my transition
is slow very slow but very steady I will
say though that on the desktop side I'm
in my office Premiere Pro is what I use
so the way I ran that test was I said
I'm going to use everything I can for
every CPU Rison consumer chips do not
have a GPS as a result of that there is
no specific optimization in mind for AMD
CPUs because most of them don't have AI
GPS and on intel side there is support
for quick sync and my decision to use
quick sink for the 1900 k was based
solely off the notion that I would also
have enabled it on the 3900 X and the
3700 X if I had other Intel CPUs in that
list that had IG peas in them I would
have enabled them in there as well you
would have seen a 9400 basically neck
and neck with a 3900 X if I had thrown
that in there that's how good quick sync
is so it would have been in my opinion a
sin to forego a very prominent and very
obvious just advantage that Intel has in
a specific case now is it specific yes
is it being nitpicky no because I use it
every day it'd be different if it was a
you know let's say it's a specific video
effect that I use maybe once every month
in one video right that's a little
that's getting a little weird right like
why would you throw this one exception
in there for to make Intel look good I
could see that argument if that's if
that's what you guys were saying I'm not
saying all of you were saying this and
most of you are fine with those tests
you understood why I did them but a few
a few people were just making baseless
accusation that the typical BS you know
Oh looks like Intel sponsored you for
this bit like it was literally an Ambu
an AMD review where I told you guys to
buy the AMD CPU at the end of it over
the Intel CPU and I still got accused of
being a sponsored Intel fanboy so I
guess I'm doing something right right
when a few people are still pissed off
you're not gonna please everybody that's
something you learn very fast in this
industry but to be told after all of
this work that took two or three weeks
to compile I am a one-man show I do all
of my own tests that is it I have no one
else to do these tests with me or for me
it is all me and I take pride in my work
because it takes time to put together
and I'm confident in my work else I
wouldn't post it on my channel with half
a million subscribers right half a
million or more potential viewers so if
it gets posted I'm confident now that's
not say that my my testing is always
perfect there could be something I do
wrong
I had a typo in that video I'm pretty
sure I said what did I say mega I said
Mpbs instead of MVPs I was something I
caught daring the upload process I was
like ah crap I didn't want to re-upload
it because then it would have taken that
much longer and I wanted to push it out
at prime time so yeah that was an issue
anyway yeah so people were in a nutshell
pissed that I ain't able to quick sync
and they thought I was unfair that's
literally the word that that a lot of
them used they said it was unfair and I
disagree wholeheartedly because I said
in the video I would have enabled the
same thing with it with the AMD CPUs had
a DS AMD CPUs included I trapeze and
that's one of the that's one of the
things that a lot of people don't think
about because most of us have discrete
GPUs but you cannot just plop a 3900 X
in a risin motherboard that has HDMI out
and get it to work without a discrete
GPU there's nothing in here to drive
video there's there's no video orange
oriented stuff baked into this like for
a specific video outs you have to have a
dedicated card for that a discrete GPU
and so is it is it a big deal no I'm not
gonna like it's something I'll point out
I'll say yeah look just keep in mind you
have to make sure that you have a
discrete card it's discrete graphics
card for these Rhys and CPUs else you
won't get any picture on your screen
that's just a byproduct of rising
architecture there are exceptions you
can get a 2400 G 3400 G at
- energy be my guest but those are not
extremely powerful CPUs by any means so
you have trade-offs no Intel is the same
thing now you can get F skew CPUs from
Intel and they don't come without GPS
and they're typically a bit cheaper we
did a review on the 9400 f it was it was
like $150 $160 Core i5 six core without
an IJ P that I thought was a really good
bang for the buck of the time now would
send two out I only think it so I don't
think it's big bang for the buck anymore
you can get a 3600 now for 200 bucks
it's gonna blow that out of the water so
things change but my stance in my
opinion makes sense and so III don't I
won't retract it I won't backtrack and
say yeah I probably should have done it
differently I did it that way because
that's my workload that's what I use and
you can see how effective it is in the
graphs the 90 100 K rendered that video
that five-minute video clip the same
video clip at the 98 the 3900 X rendered
in literally half the time with for
fewer cores right that's pretty
impressive and there's also some
misconception about there's a
misconception about CUDA acceleration
and a few people also thought that like
I got a comment at one point and it was
it was about the fact that I had
discrete cards and all these setups they
were all there was the same Asus tricks
2080 right and there was something I got
from one person that said why did you
not just enable CUDA acceleration like
most people and have your graphics card
do the rendering for you like I don't I
didn't think I had to educate people on
this I don't I don't expect everyone to
know it but we've talked about it before
on the channel others have talked about
it CUDA acceleration does next to
nothing for a video render ages doesn't
there are effects there are color
grading things you can do with CUDA
acceleration that will allow the
graphics card if it's an Nvidia car
that's supported to do some work it will
offload some of that work to your
graphics card to your 20 80 or whatever
you're using but when you click that
render that export button right whether
it be in media coder or the the default
media encoder in
premiere there is like there's not much
at all
that your graphics card is going to do
whether or not you have CUDA
acceleration enabled which by the way it
was enabled for every single Adobe test
you would expect it to be exactly the
same and it was so that it was a fair
enough comparison so I don't like I
don't get it
let's see I want to read a couple
comments Eugene says it's like if you
were comparing cars as a reviewer would
you not point out that a Jeep Wrangler
has removable doors which mace which may
be something someone wants yeah and look
like I think I think you're on the right
track Gina I think that the the issue
people had though was that it showed the
Intel CPU just destroyed just massacred
the 3900 X and that one test and and in
warp stabiliser and also one you
wouldn't expect it to win just on paper
right because it has eight cores instead
of twelve course but warp stabiliser
also uses some of that IGP someone said
that the IGP is gonna become the aux
cord in 2025 or whatever i disagree
wholeheartedly i think there's so much
you can do with an onboard graphics
processor that it would be foolish to
completely get rid of it so there will
always be a case for it I think and so I
think the CPUs will always exist whether
or not they're mainstream or not that's
a different story but Intel's been
making it work for years and certainly
workloads are taking advantage of it
including the one that I showcased so
the video render utilizing pretty much
to the max the IGP
is why it destroyed the 3100 X and look
if this was flip-flopped I really think
that especially like the diehard Andy
fanboys would have freaked out at that I
think they would have just lost their
crap because AMD fanboys the Intel
fanboys excuse me I should have said
that backwards yeah Intel fanboys
because if it's AMD doing really well
and Intel didn't look as good then yeah
I think I think until fanboys would be
pretty pissed so I think I think it goes
both ways right like I I don't think you
can really please everybody but at the
same time I think I think gimping a CPU
is worse than showing it at its best so
if you're intentionally giving something
if you're just removing some sort of
support that it has then you are
effectively not being honest with the
viewer that's my opinion now look that's
not to say
I'm not trying to say that other
reviewers who didn't include quick sink
support we're trying to be dishonest
with you maybe it just wasn't something
that they crossed their mind maybe it's
not something they use very often I
recommend that they do there's a huge
advantage I you literally cut your
render times in half if not more by
enabling hardware and coding and again
it's a multi-step process you have to
download Intel drivers until you HD
drivers I mean they're not already
installed you have to enable something
in the BIOS if enable onboard graphics
so it's not something you can just click
once and be done with it's a little
process so maybe that's why they didn't
have it enabled but most reviewers that
I saw did not have quick sync enabled
and that kind of pissed me off it's just
like why are you not showing the CPU at
its best because that's what I'm doing
for the 3900 X I'm showing it it's best
I showed it literally at stock because
that's how it performs best I didn't
show it manually overclock because then
you're not doing it a service in in
single or dual core workloads and and so
I think that yeah I think that it had to
be done I had to show it because it just
I wouldn't want to GIMP if I GIMP the
name you CPU like if I turned off the
IGP
in a navy CPU and ran it you know like
some of the other reviewers ran the
Intel 900k I think that maybe fanboys
would've been really pissed off with me
so I think the sword again cuts both
ways
I think it's justified anyway that's my
address Minh of that criticism I think
that yeah I would do it again and I
would explain it the same way I
explained it before it's something I use
every day virtually in Premiere yeah and
I also pointed out in the same video if
you're using another program like a
DaVinci Resolve 3900 X would likely win
and the reason why is because DaVinci
Resolve
can take advantage of more cores it
tends to be optimized but better for
higher core townships if you throw in a
thread Ripper 16 core it does an amazing
job at rendering in DaVinci Resolve I
know that on account of other reviewers
who have done similar tests so I was
sure to point that out I said look this
is program based so it depends on the
program but the program I use is premier
that's why I'm showing it I've used
premier for pretty much every CPU review
that I've done since the beginning
because I've use premier since the
beginning of this channel and yep I'd do
it again anyway off of that tangent you
are awesome um scroll back up here and
get to some of the stuff that I missed
some of the goodies let's dive it
Anderson donated a dollar ninety nine
super Ches says what's the deal with MSI
be four fifty bio size limits so ROM
size is an issue that was something we
addressed when we met with AMD they were
talking about how motherboard vendors
were going to have to act certain
features in bios's in order to get zen
to support on old boards now I didn't
expect it to be as big a deal with be
450 and X 470 because we we expected
support from those two motherboard
chipsets and straight up
yeah with a simple BIOS update but the
older boards especially like the be 350
boards the X through 70 boards they and
apparently you're at your be 350 board
have to have to cut certain features and
that also rolls into the UI as well
certain BIOS is I even saw this on I
forget whose website it with mine I
think gigabytes might have been as
Roxanna maybe was ask rocks cuz we did
the be 350 BIOS flash there but some of
those BIOS revisions when you update the
UI got simpler it got more basic looking
and that's not typically how it works
right if you update BIOS is typically
they had more features but because the
wrong side is limited a lot of these
chips are only I don't know what the
size limit is it's something small it's
got to be and the realm of 10 20 30 40
megabytes I don't have something like
that
because those those file sizes are
taking up so much of that space they
have to act certain features they're
doing that with Bristol Ridge I've
noticed Bristol Ridge is one of the
things that a lot of these motherboard
vendors are auctioning is that a big
deal I don't really think so like if you
if you're updating a BIOS for Zen -
chances are you're not on bristol ridge
if you were on bristol ridge then there
are certain drivers you can install that
would keep you covered during the
interim period when you're flashing the
bios cuz you're gonna lose that support
technically but yeah I that's just a
consequence of ROM size why is it that
size I have no idea I think it's
something that's very easily easily
fixable but yeah yeah again I don't
design motherboards I'm not sure what
the rationale was behind it I do know
those chips are pretty standardized and
you can see them like they're actually
physically like a little
on the board you can swap in and out but
yeah it looking also if you break a
motherboard let's say your power goes
out doing a round flash something like
that you're gonna have to buy a new chip
and you'll have to replace that chip on
the board that's how you'll get another
that's basically how you LUN break your
motherboard that's happened a few times
not to me but if you're curious if that
ever happens to you let's see Chris W
became a member what's going on Chris I
hope you feel like a hundred bucks with
that star next to your name it's no it's
one of the perks you get from being a
member you also get again the the
bimonthly Google Hangouts chats we just
had one before this livestream with a
few of the channel members and I was
pretty awesome we just hang hang out and
talk for an hour straight before the
livestream as I appreciate that Oliver
Yared five-dollar stream chat so I'm
trying to get those super chat real
quick trying to catch up looking at
buying a rise in 3600 Plus as rugby 450
and pro for 8 gigs of 2400 mega it's 260
good deal do you know why do you know a
way to flash the bias without a rise
into CPU yeah a lot of the motherboards
are not gonna allow you to do it unless
you have a right as then - excuse me is
n + chip you could probably get a dud
I'm not sure if you'd get a dud from AMD
and they used to do it I'm not sure if
they're still doing it I'm sure someone
knows something about it but I will say
that reading that right there my concern
would be your RAM I think 8 gigs I mean
that's a good deal like it's hard to
complain but the memory itself is slow
it's not the fact that it's a gigs
that's easily upgradable you get an
update 16 pretty fast just pop into more
dens or whatever but 24 hundred
megahertz it's pretty slow you would
benefit from faster and especially for
rising just remember those Infinity
fabric dependencies right there they're
tied to memory frequency and latency so
you will have slower communication
between shifflet's between CC X's as a
result of slower memory and that's just
the way the Infinity fabric works so
that's why rising benefits in a nutshell
from faster memory scrolling up a little
more Miguel Moreno $2 Super chat love
from Texas easily the top of tech tubers
I appreciate that Thank You Miguel
and then humility $2 to perch at what's
the best CP for game today if you're
just gaming I would say that 3600 I have
any
yeah but I know that's probably gonna be
the best value CPU so yeah there's that
and then we got a ideal then it's two
dollar super chat and then Daniel Silva
donated four 9s super chat no questions
with those ask questions if you if
you're gonna donate to me or throw super
chat money on me to ask a question that
way you feel like you're getting
something for it I'd appreciate that
let's see sorry about that I died to get
through this stuff but AMD is offering
dumb chips for bio a BIOS updates
awesome so platinum said that if you
have a link to somewhere you can sign up
to get a dud ship that would be
appreciated I'm not sure if they're
charging what they're charging I'm sure
it's gonna be pretty cheap if they're
charging anything but I don't know if
you're gonna be able to post a link in
the chat if you can't postal if you
can't post the link in the live chat
post it on discord or tweeted at me and
I will stick it to the top of the video
description for those who are curious so
yeah Bob we have like tried to
deactivate patreon so you shouldn't be
like if you're still donating a patreon
I suggest just becoming a member because
that's like we're trying to funnel it
through YouTube now and not patreon it's
just too complicated and I don't like
having multiple platforms for this kind
of this kind of thing so uh yeah I would
suggest canceling you don't have to
become a member by I know who you are
Bob Flanders you have you've done a lot
for us you've supported us from from a
long time ago more than a year I would
say probably at least two years that's
as far back as I can really remember but
yeah I mean it patreon and we're trying
to just get rid of that we can't
completely terminate the account for tax
purposes but you should not be donating
there anymore and that's why we don't
even link it in our video descriptions
anymore okay let's see agent blunt says
rising 3 on X 570 stove RAM issues with
four sticks I heard this I don't know if
that's confirmed or not but I have heard
that I was sure to test when I got my
sample kit from a and B my reviewer kit
I I was sure not to use the memory that
they included in the box I'm going to
show you guys what they included but I
didn't tell you where I got them so the
memory that came in our Rison reviewer
kits
was from g.skill and it was Trident Zi
royal it was the this gold these gold
memory modules right and they included
two of them now the timings all right so
here we go thirty-six hundred megahertz
which of course is optimal for rice art
on my nose is like itching I don't know
why thirty-six hundred megahertz and
then Kathleen c16 the sixteen sixteen
sixteen thirty six which is pretty good
I don't know if these are beady eyes I'm
not I don't know if all royal kids are
beady eyes I don't think so the code is
sixteen D - 16 G TRG so GT RG is the the
model number on these but I purposefully
didn't use these because I felt like
okay well da a Amy's gonna give you the
best of the best and the kid because
they want their CPUs to look the best so
my thinking was alright I'll just pull
out a random kid of RAM from my closet
and we'll just see how it goes and I
actually pulled out another g.skill kit
but it was a really old kid it was a G
school tried in the RGB kit but it was
released before as then 2 came out I'm
pretty sure and it was not AMD optimized
it wasn't like a specific kit for AMD
and so I said yeah we're just gonna use
this kit because it's not the
recommended kit and I just want to see
how it fares and it fared very well it
was easily able to hit X and P the the
system reset a few times trying to train
the memory which is something I actually
didn't know much about beforehand so if
you were pointed it out I had to do a
bit of research into what it actually
was and why this system was resetting
multiple times so thank you I learned
something from that comment anyway the
the memory training is important for
Rison it helps train the memory tighten
the timings get the the memory basically
as optimal as possible and that's why
the system walked time to reset after a
cpu swap or you install a new Ram or
something of the sort and yeah so I
installed this this kind of random tried
NZ kit that wasn't sent by AMD that
wasn't meant to be used for an AMD
platform necessarily and it worked just
fine I think it was a thirty-two hundred
megahertz kit and tight timing so I mean
it was tight timing but it but it wasn't
like
wasn't a Navy specific kit so I enabled
XMP and it did just fine
that said AMD deliberately sent a dual
channel kit of two dims not four so if
that tells you anything I mean I know
it's a little cheaper to get to but I
would say I heard that it was still an
issue and based off what a.m. he sent us
the reviewers I would say that it's
still probably a thing I will I will
check that out I will I will see what I
can find online and also testing here
might as well Valley one two three at
science 2d hey Greg since we are at the
topic of videos that triggered people do
you have any plans to revisit the
passive cooling video with the CPU tower
cooler on a more powerful GPU well I
already revisited the video once I redid
it already and had a 2400 G passively
cooled and people thought that was a
pretty good video so I'll stop there for
now I do want to buy a one of those
pallet passive tend to DT is throw that
into the system and also see if the
whole thing is stable and then that
would be pretty awesome but yeah that's
kind of where I mean I don't want to
like turn this channel into like a
passive cool channel is not my thing
it's very new it's not something I can
recommend most people pursue but it was
cool to experiment I thought that was
very fun Chris W five-dollar super chat
again Christa vsync recepy that just
can't remember I think so I think so
I recall correctly docked on horizon
mobile comparing rising seven thirty
seven hundred u Vega ten its 216 at $600
for 7700 HQ for 750 secondary 1080p
primo machine yeah I don't know much
about it I don't dabble much in mobile I
just I have never owned a rising mobile
laptop I just never have even the ones
like they have the the the aim for
socket like the desktop socket in the
laptops that that would be really cool
to test and to experiment with but I
have never gotten my hands on one so I
really don't have the background to give
you a definite on that I will say though
that if we're talking about well I don't
know I know I have never tested in Vega
10 if the 7500 HQ has an IG p on top of
the 1050 then I would say it would still
do better in premiere
so that would be my assumption just
because I know that the 9900 Kay
absolutely slayed everything with the
Quick Sync enabled so if I was doing the
same thing on mobile I would want more
than likely the i7 despite only having
four cores compared to eight I'm not
sure how that would affect everything
else in the system but for purely
rendering that would be my go-to let's
see we have here no one cares a siesta
science to do micron EDI is good I'd
suck I mean like it's not gonna be
Samsung B dies the reason why everyone
knows what that one is
my experience with micro II dies I think
I have one kit that's micron II and the
only reason I know it's micron is
because I ripped the heatsink off of it
micron II remember
I know I have a few kits I know what I
know my laptop has Hynix memory pretty
sure it has high next I don't know maybe
was micron
I always know because it's the M with
the circle around it I'm trying to think
I don't really know now I don't remember
I don't even know if I have hynix memory
I'm sure I've Hanks memory I just don't
know where which kits they are I mean
they don't tell you these things this is
one of the things that I wish mother
like memory manufacturers would be more
upfront about the only time they tell
you what kind of chips you have is when
it sends some beat I and even then they
don't tell you all the time so it's kind
of weird I just don't know but let's see
Chris says neither why it's so
inexpensive for sooner dollars I might
pull the trigger and arisin yeah I think
I mean if you're going Zen to and I'm in
a mobile solution I think you'll be fine
Megaten should be fine I yeah for most
of your stuff it's gonna be plenty
let's see recommended megahertz on RAM
good question addressed just a few times
on Twitter and elsewhere for Rison
you'll start to notice in the the
latency is between CC X's really start
to taper off as in level out you don't
see many marginal gains passed around
3200 megahertz
if you read at least 3000 megahertz or
above for memory on your Rison platform
and you can get that frequency at a
decent Cass and decent timing then
you're fine you're gonna pretty much see
the law of diminishing returns really
start to take over past 3000 so again
assuming your timings aren't crap that
would be a fine frequency but the Bob
unknown he says quit picking your nose
I'm really not picking my nose I'm
actually scratching it like for some
reason my nose is like really itchy like
right on the sides I don't know why I
always outside working on the car today
and it was hot like my garage faces the
Sun in the afternoon which is a big
mistake I should not have started work
at 4:00 p.m. because it sounds like Oh
4:00 p.m. is like it's not best not bad
it's not hot but when you live in
Florida 4:00 p.m. in the summer is still
pretty toasty you know and when the
sun's facing you like while you're on
the ground I was like changing the oil
in the car yeah so I got pretty dirty
then I took a shower and I my nose is
just like itchy so yeah that's why I'm
not picking my nose I wouldn't do that
on the live stream but bah Nicolas Lopez
house hurricane Barry I have no idea I'm
in Florida we we're not being hit by
Hurricane Barry Robinson Joseph's Intel
is just not competitive anymore ah look
they have to be if they want to exist I
think that there's a certain percentage
of the market that would buy Intel no
matter what even if they were extremely
more expensive for the same performance
or possibly even worth performance I
mean that's how diehard some fans can be
I would call those people fanboys if
they had no other reason to get Intel
other than the fact that it's Intel
unless you have workloads or software
Suites that specifically require an
Intel or optimized for Intel then that
would be a case to pay more for the same
performance but then it wouldn't be the
same performance it would be better
performance in that software suite so I
Intel has to be competitive they have to
they they are I mean that's that's
that's how this works if you have
competition the two competing companies
will compete on price level to compete
on an advertiser level to compete on a
function
level competition drives innovation that
is one of the things that that I
appreciate about competitions for the
things I appreciate about capitalism
capitalism has its downsides as well yes
tons of people are ingredie and that's a
byproduct of capitalism but the whole
point is it's a level playing field
because everybody's greedy right a few
people don't care but like if you're
willing to be competitive chances are
you're probably greedy to an extent and
you're going to do what you can
hopefully within legal realms to be as
competitive and and yeah just to be as
competitive as possible
intel has a lot of market share and they
have many contracts and they have many
relationships with many big companies
and just like them but so does AMD and
AMD is working to regain some of that
market share and what I think is going
to happen is the same thing that
happened back in the early 2000s and
again later and the turn of the decade
2010 2011 we're gonna have flip-flop
again Intel's doing just fine
they really are folks they're not
bleeding for cash anything like that
their stock prices would reflect this
the the reason why I think so many
people are saying Oh Intel's not
competitive anymore is because you're
only looking at this through a small
small lens focused on the consumer the
end consumer who builds pcs for fun for
living who cares they're the end
consumer they're the enthusiasts but
they're not the biggest client there I
mean there there are many other
contracts again many other people many
other companies that are paying Intel's
bills we're paying a part of it sure
we're part of it we're part of the sale
structure but we're not the only part of
this and the same goes for AMD this
isn't just Intel we're talking about
here I don't know enough about Intel's
capital structure to dive into this in a
deep way and just you know decide oh if
we all just started buying AMD we didn't
tell go under I don't know one off about
it my assumption would be no but I don't
know I will say that Intel is just like
AMD in this regard they are competitive
they have to be they know they are they
know that
they're in an economy at least in the
states where competition is everywhere
and at the the moment that they lost
that competition from AMD is when they
got lazy when they started slacking off
when R &amp;amp; D wasn't at its peak Intel has
its own fab so you guys realize this AMD
uses TSM see that's the Taiwanese
semiconductor company right they use
TSMC to create their dyes to create the
wafers that end up being split up and
thrown into substrate that ends up in
your consumer P or consumer CPU right
that's it
Robinson says I'm biased I don't know
what I don't know what he's talking
about being biased I'm just telling you
like it his I would say the same thing
for a and B in fact that's what I was
willing to do but Intel has anyway back
on track Intel has their own fabs right
so Intel was working on 10 min 10
nanometer for a long time and it just
wasn't wasn't there now they feel this
huge kick from AMD because AMD you
saying we got all this good stuff
decent prices actually really good
prices comparably you want a 90 100 K
you got to pay up or it's 500 bucks for
it
you can get almost identical performance
- the IGP which again it's for very few
people like myself where I actually use
it most people don't so who cares - the
IGP for a hundred and eighty bucks less
why would you not buy the 3,700 X
instead had this been flip-flopped had
aimed deep in the King for a long time
and we just didn't have the competition
anymore and Intel was just slacking on
whatever 32 nanometer stuff they had
let's say they were on let's say they
were on Sandy Bridge for like eight
years which is basically I mean I'm not
comparing the two architectures are
different and there's a reason why Ivy
Bridge Sandy Bridge and and it ended up
being has well we're superior but I what
I am saying is that if it was reversed
and Intel happened to be on something at
the time that would have been similar
and that would have been Sandy Bridge or
Ivy Bridge and AMD was pushing out just
incremental upgrades we're talking
incremental to the point where it's
almost like a blurred line like is this
the same CPU are you guys
just throwing in this in a new box and
just calling it a new CPU like what am I
really getting here come on folks like
other than like hacking into more cores
causing this thing to run super freaking
hot what am I getting here if they'd
have been reversed I'd have told you the
same thing if Intel had a 3,700 X right
and AMD had an equivalent competitor for
500 bucks I'd tell you to buy the
freaking Intel chip you know why because
it's the better buy for you that the the
value oriented consumer so this isn't
about red and blue this isn't about red
and green Susan about green and blue I
don't give a crap
none of them pay my bills they don't we
took we might take ad sponsorships from
them I haven't taken any money from well
I take that back
AMD and gigabyte kind of together
sponsored some of our Computex coverage
but again that's not going to convince
that's not going to sway my opinion
right money doesn't buy opinions money
buys talking points like if you want me
to throw up a video praising your
product it's going to be a showcase it's
going to be a video where yeah it's a
sponsored video what do you expect you
threw money at me I'm going to time
going to say what you want me to say
those companies have to approve your
video before it goes live but in a
review they just send you stuff and they
cross their fingers and hope it's a good
review but they don't know there's no
guarantee because I could say whatever I
want because it's it's a review it's
opinionated it's based on my experience
it's based on stuff I have in the office
that I can test against it it's based on
my perception of value it's how it's how
it's gonna be right it's it's I know
that most of you like care about money
right not like a greedy timing hamster
some of you are a little greedy but
you've probably at least mind your
checkbook and you know that you can't
just go out and spend freely on whatever
you want cuz you'll end up in debt and
you'll never get out of it right maybe
you have a family of kids and you have
other more important things to worry
about than a freaking CPU in your system
right so I know that that money has to
go a long way for you for most of you it
goes a long way I try to make it go a
long way for me and I'm the same way if
I buy anything out of pocket I do my
best to do as much research
as I can to know that I'm making the
best most informed purchase decision
where I'm getting the most value for my
dollar point blank
I will rarely pay more money for the
same performance unless there's string
attached like a better warranty maybe
it's just a better product it has like
you just maybe more reviews I've paid
more money for a product that looked
nearly identical on Amazon because it
had better reviews and you know what if
that's how it helps you sleep better at
night that's fine so your money you
handle it the way you want my job is
again tough you guys make informed
purchase decisions and that's that
that's that's why I think it's silly to
call any review like any I could say
this confidently you want look at any
other tech youtuber out there that that
that I've met Paul Kyle Jay Steve other
Steve Brian I don't care any of them if
you watch any of their reviews right
they're going to tell you and their
honest opinions what they think is the
best value for the dollar and they'll
tell you what's the best CPU they tell
you what's the best value and I'll tell
you what's the cheapest what you
shouldn't buy what you should buy you
know why they tell you things and they
then you know why the weather honest
with you because they know that you guys
are gonna bail if they're not honest
they know that if they tell you oh you
should buy the 9900 Kay instead it's
technically the better CPU still it's
still technically the better gaming CPU
even if it's just by a few FPS you guys
need to have the best gaming CPU so
spend that extra 180 bucks on the best
so that you can have the best you're
gonna feel so much better about it if I
preach that or if it was reversed and it
was in it was let's say it was AMD in
Intel's position and I was telling you
to buy the best from AMD instead of the
Intel equivalent at much cheaper prices
like I would lose so many viewers from
that and that's they're like we're
incentivized to be honest with you like
that's what you guys need to understand
if we're not honest with you if let's
say like someone's being paid under the
table not disclosing it which is illegal
we do that here and they tell you that
yeah you just you know be honest but
also tell them they should buy it
because it's technically still the best
and we win did that we would lose
viewers and then if we lose viewers we
don't get any more
under ships because nobody's watching
our channel anymore so why the heck
would you ever feel incentivized to take
money to say things that aren't true or
to say things that are against your
opinion I would not I never done this
and I would like to think I never would
that's my honest opinion and that's this
is how I've lived up to this point for
this channel I would never take money
from a company that I did not think was
offering a product of value if it was a
product that I thought sucked I would
not take money from them because I know
that despite getting that one-time
payment however much or little it might
be I'm not going to have the trust of
you guys anymore to let me to do more
videos like that why because someone
paid me to say something about a product
that I thought was crap right and if
we've ever been in like a situation
where company said yeah we'll pay you
this amount of money to say something
really really good it would be just a
great great thing for you to say this
and this and that would be awesome we've
pushed back before in situations where I
thought that a product really wasn't as
good as they were making it out to be I
would tell them like I'm comfortable
saying this not this if you guys are
still okay with it we can move forward
we can push the sponsored spot we can do
this sponsoring video whatever right but
if they if they say no this is this is
it I've turned down I turned up more
money last year in 2018
then I accepted put it that way there's
a lot of stuff out there that's garbage
there's a lot of stuff out there that's
good as well and back to CPUs I think
that CPUs it's it's it's where the
tipping point and that's why I was
telling you guys especially after my
thirty seven hundred serve you that I
think that thirty seven thirty seven
hundred X is by far the better value and
it you have a much more friendly
platform to work with we got our 3900 X
to work on a freaking a320 motherboard a
board that wasn't even supposed to be
allowed to run Zen - and we got it to
frickin work right from gigabyte and
this is entirely vendor dependent but
the fact is you can do so much with this
platform it is so versatile and if you
have the dud CPU or compatible see if
you flash the BIOS you could really get
technically
any motherboard with the compatible BIOS
to work with any Xen CPU how freaking
crazy is that can you do that with Intel
No
do I expect Intel to do something
similar with a similar platform in five
or six years kind of yeah I think they
feel compelled to now they feel that
that is a huge competitive advantage for
AMD so why would they not copy it is it
because they feel content with the fewer
sales that they have now than they did
four years ago I mean maybe they knew
maybe they do maybe they feel content
with that maybe they could they feel
content with being the more nish
expensive product right you can buy a
Ferrari because it's a Ferrari or you
can buy a Toyota Camry because it's more
reliable heck you can buy a Nissan GTR
for we used to be able to buy enough
about a hundred hundred twenty grand I
think now the most expensive black
edition or Nismo model is like two
hundred thousand dollars it is starting
to give in like supercar territory now
but back back in 20 let's say when they
first came out 2008 so let's just say
their 2012 you get a 2012 GT our brand
new for a little over $100,000 that 0 to
16 2.9 seconds most Ferraris couldn't
even do 0 to 60 and 2.9 seconds at that
point in time in fact I would say almost
all of them couldn't do a 0 to 60 that
fast and if that's your metric if zero
to 60 is your metric for a car and we're
acquainting that to frame rate right
then to get 2.9 seconds for 100k or you
spend 500 grand and get a Ferrari that
does 2.7 seconds right where is the real
value if you only care about the 0 to 60
time because that's I mean let's be
honest you can't really go faster than
60 in most places in the States anyway
unless you're on a freeway or a
racetrack so if you're in the city it's
really just in the 0 to 60 it's the 0 to
50 0 to 40 0 to 30 whatever it's the
initial torque right it's the it's the
pullback and that acceleration is what
I'm trying to equate to FPS now if
that's your metric if you care about
frame rates because you play games a lot
and that's really it first off I think
that's a good metric alright the reason
there's a reason why we show frames per
second for games because that's kind of
like the only metric that matters then
I'm going to tell you that the better
value is the GTR right you get it
alright that's it there shouldn't even
be an argument there is it a better
value car yes
is it a Ferrari No
is it supposed to be a Ferrari no do I
think Intel is the equivalent of a
Ferrari no I'm not saying that I don't
think there's that big of a disparity
honestly like I'm using a 9900 k in this
system because I render a lot that is
literally the only reason it's still in
my system if I switched fully to The
DaVinci Resolve I will switch I promise
you guys I will switch to AMD and I'm in
the process of switching I talked about
that a little more in the livestream but
anyway it's about value I don't want you
guys to be upset I don't want to have
buyer's remorse that would make me feel
bad as a reviewer and it would probably
make you lose trust in me and that is
where I want to wrap up that thanks for
hearing me ramble through that I do want
to run through the super chats at the
end here let's see here let's go back up
here okay token tech 5 super Chan I
appreciate that Oh Bob Slater's become a
member Bob I appreciate that Bob I again
be sure to drop by our hangouts that we
have if you're in the discord and then
you'll see the link there I also link
the live chats in the YouTube feed about
10 minutes before we go live on hangout
so you'll be able to click the link and
join the call and you can just chat with
me anyway token tech says hey science
dude I have a 3700 X with a custom loop
from ek and I'm hitting over 85 °c in
prime95 and idle temps are awful
how are your temps that's weird my 3700
was ice-cold I mean it was it was
hitting I think 70 C while gaming and
this was with and some games were more
intense than others obviously the more
user CP the hotter it's gonna get but
mine was not anywhere near that hot it's
been and I never used a custom loop but
it should be cooler than that so unless
your pump is dead which I doubt you'd be
able to see that more than likely or
unless you haven't seated the CPU
correctly you just got super unlucky but
I would check the CPU seeding make sure
that you're you've got solid secure
contact to me that's like you got to
have that doesn't sound like you do
because if temps are pretty hot so yeah
I would check that let's see we also
have we have a $1 super chat from ideal
again I appreciate that a deal thanks
for watching we have another $1 super
chat from your leader treks thank you
your leader treks appreciate that Chris
has a $5 super chat says have you seen
the videos where some of the smaller
tech youtuber
are accusing some of the big reviewers
of being biased towards AMD's release I
have not I don't know who said that I
would love to hear the accusations
because I think they would just be
really juicy and as far as I'm aware
none of the big tech tubers if you want
to include me in that you can't I don't
think that I'm technically big I would
say if you're at a million subs or more
you're probably a big tech youtuber so
that would keep Paul Kyle Jay Linus in
the ring
I saw almost all of their reviews I mean
they get pretty great done and after a
while but I after they aired because we
all aired our reviews kind of at the
same time when the NBA lifted granted it
was for different products some come
some channels didn't like all the cps at
one time but as for the accusations i
don't really know who they would be
accusing if they accused anybody if you
guys know who they were accusing but i'd
love to watch the video a first time i
think would be highly comical i'm just
kind of i mean what's the definition of
bias like do anything they skewed data
like that's a pretty harsh accusation
and that's potentially defamatory
depending on if it's substantiated or
not so they better be careful if that's
the case but if they're just saying like
bias towards an AMD like what's again
their justification with being biased
you would have to show that like the
beta was consistent with other reviewers
or other finders but your conclusions
were different but I can't see how your
conclusions would be different like if
you're if you're value oriented AMD is
the way to go I've said that since then
to I've said that since Zen like I don't
I don't see how you can call that bias
like it's just kind of the truth so it
really depends on what they're accusing
them off I mean maybe they're accusing
me I don't know that would be really fun
because then I could address it directly
but if they're accusing other tech
eateries I mean I decided to be curious
to see what they're accusing them of but
I highly doubt any of the popular tech
youtubers out there are biased in that
sense I mean sure they probably have
favorites like I have favorite products
that I use but when I'm trying to be
unbiased and trying to show you guys
like the
data straight up and then I draw
conclusions from that data my
conclusions might be opinionated but I
think they're grounded I mean like if I
told you again that the 3900 X was like
by far the way better CPU and everyone
should go buy it instead of the 3700 X
that to me would be rather baseless
because the 3700 X did almost as well as
the 3900 X in nearly every gaming
benchmark and in some cases the deltas
between productivity workloads were even
justified right it's so the $180 price
hike for the 3900 X in my opinion wasn't
justified for the streaming scenarios so
should you buy a 3900 X in place of a
3700 X for streaming in my opinion I
don't think you have to I think you can
get by just 5 that 37 3 X because the
margins were the same that the frame
rates lost were the same between both
CPUs essentially the same so yeah that's
my anyway let's see your leader tricks
again 500 superjet appreciate that I
says my mobile Intel is beating my
thread Ripper Gen 2 for Adobe renders
why it's probably cuz you have quick
sync enable that's probably why token
tech totally took everything apart and
still bad temps that really sucks
that means you just have a really hot
ship check though make sure that you're
checking frequencies maybe a PPO or
something else turned on where it's
boosting your CPU to as high as it'll go
you look your idle temps really don't
matter as much especially if your fluid
is already soaked so if your fluids heat
soaked then your idle temps are gonna be
hot right because the metal or what
essentially would be the metal in your
your system it's gonna be the fluid in
this case but water has a high heat
capacity so it takes a while for water
to warm up takes more energy for water
to warm up but once it's warmed up it's
gonna stay warm for quite a while and
that will keep your idle times up as a
result right so when your temperature
deltas are smaller then your CPU times
gonna be higher if your temperature
Delta's are greater like if you're
cooling with liquid nitrogen then your
CPU temps are gonna be a lot lower right
even at idle especially a lot so anyway
yeah there's that let's see Chris says
my issue isn't the accusations but the
fact that they pulled uh-oh there are
people biased on the reviews but we will
say who oh and we have names yeah I like
if you have if you have something like
that just like roasting in your brain
like just grow a pair of balls and just
say like that's how I look
that's a personal take but like if you
have that much beef on somebody like why
would you bother figuring out who they
are if you're not gonna actually
disclose who they are
so like that'd be my thing I don't again
I don't know if I'm including this or
not but even if I'm not even if I'm not
the people that they're talking about
it'd be hilarious if they were cuz I
would totally grill them because there's
there's absolutely no proof of that
thing I've done anything to suggest that
I think you guys would call me out on if
I was being biased and I've done things
that have pissed amb fanboys off before
as well so I don't think I'm I don't
think I'm without sin on either side but
yeah I would just say grow a pair say
who it is why would you tease it if
you're not gonna say it like that's just
stupid you're just trying to get
publicity in my opinion if that's all
you're gonna do so prove me wrong saying
who they are and then we can we can talk
about it from there I mean I look if
it's somebody like I say they accuse I'm
gonna use let's use Kyle ID I know
Kyle's not this way but let's just say
he says Kyle I'm not gonna like jump in
and throw my two cents into the ring but
I would love to hear Kyle defend himself
because I feel like Kyle would
absolutely trash whoever was accusing
him of saying that so yeah I just I just
want to you know see him Duke it out but
anyway all right one more Super chat
here was from Ren Ren Jen hope I said
that I hope I said that right rancha I
don't know what currency that is but I
appreciate the support
I appreciate the viewership and I thank
you all for watching especially our
members Thank You members for pitching
in a little boy was more than - I almost
said two cents but it's not it's like
five bucks month but anyway I appreciate
members especially and I remember to
stay tuned for our custom hangouts live
streams if if you are a member it's just
a way for me to be a little more
personal we can chat about whatever in a
closed hangout sessions be fun anyway
thank you guys again for watching and we
will be back at it I think - maybe
tomorrow night or definitely Monday
night with another video ciao ciao for
now
now here comes the awkward I'm waiting
to cancel the livestream okay here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
