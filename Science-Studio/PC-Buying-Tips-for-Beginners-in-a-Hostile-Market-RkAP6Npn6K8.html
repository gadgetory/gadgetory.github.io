a tough one to get into right now let's
be real graphics card and power supply
prices are inflated thanks to excessive
mining and system RAM and storage drives
are nearly double what they used to be
thanks to micron Samsung and others
shorting current supply in favor of R&amp;amp;D
look if I could surmise this entire
economy into a single picture it would
be this one right here are you freaking
kidding me miners buying these up in
massive quantities because I mean what's
a miner got to do with CPU horsepower
right they've done this so much presses
of even otherwise useless CPUs have
inflated well not useless it's a seller
on but not to worry I've got all the pro
tips you beginners out there need when
first getting into the PC gaming
industry how to do so without breaking
the bank and how to do so without
compromising too much on the performance
that I know you so preciously desire now
a few of these tips might hurt just a
bit not gonna lie and a few you might
not agree with all of my choices here
but if I was a baller on a budget
jumping into the PC industry for the
first time these are the things that I
would would do I would hope someone
would recommend to me in such a hostile
market the first thing I recommend new
PC gamers do should they decide to build
which I recommend is up for only 8
gigabytes of system ram this is
temporary of course and only suggested
for peer gamers but it'll easily shave
off 60 to 80 bucks
and look I've run these tests countless
times in fact very recently not much has
changed into this video right here so a
gigabytes is still plenty for gamers I
don't recommend that for content
creators and whatnot but this is just a
video addressing those who want to get
into PC gaming for the first time so
with prices being as hostile as they are
currently I recommend 8 gigabytes for
now once prices do come back down maybe
upgrade with another 8 gig pack later on
just a few years ago you could buy 16
gigs of ram for the price of 8 today
just a bit outrageous if you ask me the
next pro tip involves a question I get
asked quite a bit Greg what should I
upgrade first my CPU or my GPU and I'll
confess I usually say the graphics card
regardless of what CPU motherboard Ram
you got in there unless it's something
from 1999 in which case you just
completely rebuild your system but if
it's you know a relatively recent I say
within the last five five or so years if
you're on FX
or maybe Ivy Bridge that's probably the
furthest
I would go and even then I would still
try to get you to squeeze out some money
for a new platform eventually although
Ram prices are keeping me from
recommending that totally right now a
graphics card swap is literally just
that it's plug-and-play and it's not
gonna cost as much as a completely new
platform this recommendation also
assumes that you'd be jumping from ddr3
to four in the event of a platform
upgrade which would require you know RAM
and that's gonna cost you quite a bit
right now if it wasn't so damn expensive
I'd choose the platform instead but with
rx 5 ATS 10 60s and 10 70s working back
into stock I'd advise this upgrade first
especially if you're moving from
anything earlier than nvidias 500 or AMD
7000 series
you're still likely to see a solid
framerate jump as well in fact I would
argue that in most cases you'll see a
higher framerate jump by upgrading your
graphics card than you will if you
upgrade your CPU and RAM
now this next tip goes out to those of
you who insists on pairing 1000 watt
power supplies with 300 watt computers I
know they look beautiful I love the
modularity I love that they're super
quiet but in a budget build this should
not be a top priority I'm sorry stop
wasting money I don't care what your
80-plus efficiency is or what overclock
you're sporting and with your CPU and
your affix card it's just not worth it a
thousand watt PSU is overkill in most
cases an 800 watt power supply is
overkill okay if you want the future a
proofing upgrade path whatever you guys
call it fine okay but you shouldn't be
looking to future-proof that many things
in a budget build that kind of defeats
the purpose instead I invite newbies to
check out my power supply wattage video
for a good idea of what you should opt
for I recommend at least 80 plus but
going for anything above 80 plus gold
really makes no sense in a budget build
stick to a name-brand manufacturer like
C sonic and you should be a-ok
the next thing I recommend at least a
quad-core CPU and from a modern
generation something like horizon don't
go with FX 4300 I'm sorry that
architecture I'm gonna cut it more on
that right here also I wouldn't go much
further back than maybe has well unless
you can get Ivy Bridge or Sandy Bridge
for a super cheap price we're talking
sub 200 bucks for the CPU RAM and
motherboard all included most cases an
are five sixteen hundred's gonna be your
best value chip even though it is 200 or
so bucks it's gonna be worth it I don't
recommend you cheap out on your CPU
because if you do
changing the CFU not always gonna take a
lot longer but you might even have to
swap your motherboard swap your RAM it's
just not ideal I would say in a future
proofing situation just to buy a cheaper
CPU now only to plan to upgrade your CPU
two years from now because by then a
newer CPU gen is gonna be out you're
gonna want that instead packing six
cores and twelve threads the r5 1600 is
my sweet spot I recommended it in a
separate video
the quad core variants are also very
compelling as for Intel a hand-me-down
i5 or i7 like I said would do nicely
even as far back as Ivy Bridge if you
can find the platform for a decent price
ddr3 isn't too pricy either it's
remained rather untouched by this
bizarre market behavior sure you're
taking a step back but there are some
killer deals out there I invite you just
to have a look that's all I'm saying
these are just a few tips in mind that
should steer you clear of much of the
price inflation taking place in the PC
gaming industry at the moment
feel free to critique and add as you
please in the comments below everyone's
got a preference these are just the
first few things in which I would
compromise in this current market if you

thumbs up thumbs down for the opposite
