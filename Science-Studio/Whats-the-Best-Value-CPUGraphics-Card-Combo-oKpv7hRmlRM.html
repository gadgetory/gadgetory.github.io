there isn't a cup of coffee it's 4:00
a.m. so perfect so today on Twitter I
set up a QA I wanted to know what all of
you wants to know either about myself or
the channel or the tech industry in
general and a few of you asked the exact
same question that if that was very
intriguing it's a subjective question I
get asked this a lot but I've never
actually thought about the perfect combo
the perfect graphics card CPU combo you
could possibly conjure up in this
current market now I'll admit the CPU
part for me wasn't all that complicated
when it comes to bang for the buck how
much you get how much performance you
can squeeze out of any given CPU for the
price I think that risin of this current
state is the way to go I think that
Intel i5 lineup is pretty much dead at
this point
I think the i7 still have a competitive
advantage in some cases a 7700 K is
still the best gaming CPU on the market
but it does cost around 300 bucks so
it's difficult to justify that CPU for a
marginal FPS increase in most games over
a CPU that on AMD side has more cores
more threads not the highest frequency
which is its Achilles heel at this point
but is much cheaper as well which is
what most people consider when they're
buying a CPU how much money do I have to
spend to get the performance that I'm
looking for so let's do that let's talk
about the CPU choice first the one that
I think is the best bang for the buck
and then we'll throw in the graphics
card I'll talk about why it shows that
when it's kind of an all-around
contender just in terms of resolution
and refresh rate it will do okay 4k
gaming light 4k gaming 1080p no problem
again refresh rates up to 144 Hertz and
most of those resolutions as well but
for the CPU I think the best value chip
you can currently buy is the AMD r5 1600
now I say that for a variety of reasons
not only is it a decent gaming chip
obviously it's got six cores 12 threads
an okay overclock it's not going to get
anywhere near Kaiba Lake but until been
refreshing the exact same crap for the
past three generations so yeah they
should be at 50 Hertz by now but the
1606 cores in 12 threads will do it
justice you won't find a thread
bottleneck for the most part I think
battlefield one off the top of my head
is one of the only games it will
probably get somewhere close to max
utilization on the six core CPU that's
an exception I don't expect that to
become the norm anytime soon so yeah
don't worry about that not only that
though the risin 5 1600 is proven to be
an excellent content creation CPU as
well which is pleasantly surprising my
daily driver the i7 6700 K which is a
$300 CPU mind you renders of five-minute
1080p 60fps file in around 4 minutes
it's usually around a minute per minute
of footage to render in that resolution
and frame rate now the r5 1600 did a
really good job keeping up here I was
very impressed with a 200 ollars CPU
almost outperforming 300 of our CPU in a
task that it's pretty intensive for all
CPUs in general I expect that the r5 s
of render time was more dependent on the
CPUs frequency than it was the core
count nonetheless I can say with 100%
confidence that if I had 300 bucks right
now on the table and I had to choose
between an i7 6700 K and an r5 1600 I
would choose the r5 1600 any day of the
week at pocket at extra hundred bucks or
spend it elsewhere maybe like a better
graphics card and that leads us very
smoothly into graphics card choice now
please it's a pet peeve of mine if
you're going to say which GPU should I
buy that that's incorrect you don't say
which GPU should you buy because that
implies that you're only going to buy
the graphics processor itself and not
the whole PCB like the whole car but the
cooler on it too that's called a
graphics card folks that's not a GPU but
I think the best bang for the buck
graphics card right now is actually from
the Green Team is a gtx 1070 now I know
the graphics cards in general right now
are extremely hard to find especially at
semi decent prices because of miners
everywhere
thank you but if you can get your hands
even on I used GTX 1074 around 300 bucks
that is gold my friend that is an
excellent graphics card let me tell you
I used a 1070 for like 6 months straight
because I was also could afford and that
card was a workhorse it did so much for
me at grin and I paid 400 bucks for it
back then but it was still worth it at
$400 keep in mind I'm stating this
without taking into consideration
resolution and refresh rate those are
the two things I think it should look at
always first and foremost before
deciding on a graphics card to buy but
in a general sense I think that the best
thing for the buck card right now if you
can find one is a gtx 1070 nvidia really
did this was solid here even upon
initial
they gave us a $400 card that was on par
with a 90 DTI which mind you months
earlier was a $600 card the Pascal
architecture gave us an excellent
performance per dollar ratio we weren't
paying as much money to get the same
performance as we were out of Maxwell
and on top of that we weren't putting as
much power into our cards to get the
frame rate that we wanted so efficiency
went up that's always a good thing again
this is entirely circumstantial this
assumes that you don't have a fixed
budget that you're just looking for the
best bang for the buck out there that's
what a lot of people ask me about they
don't assume that they only have 400
bucks to spend they just say well how
much do I need to save up to get the
most for my money that's a very powerful
question and I think I hope at least
that this video kind of answers that for
you
I think that an r5 1600 is a solid
middle ground CP it's actually above
average I would say in the current
market the gtx 1070 is also an excellent
graphics card that you could probably
find used for around 300 bucks even if
you can't find it used buy one for 350
new it's still an excellent graphics
card I would do it all over again that
way well by dr5 1600 in the gtx 1070 and
be completely fined with almost any
resolution in gaming solid refresh rates
up to 144 hertz
and most importantly i won't feel the
buyer's remorse like i didn't get what i
expected for the money that I spent so
if you've got let's say a $400 fixed
budget you can't go over that you've
been saving it for two or three months
and this is what you have to spend you
obviously can't go with this combo here
these two units alone would send you
over that budget but I do think you
should consider the r5 1600 kind of like
a goal for a CPU choice like this is I
hate using the term future-proof but it
is it's a future-proof CPU for 200 bucks
and that's insane like five years ago
that didn't exist AMD is giving us what
Intel's been giving us at a
significantly higher price and that is
powerful Intel can do one of two things
at this point ignore everything
happening on the red team which I think
would be unwise or they can lower the
price of their six core CPUs in which
case competition and you know capitalism
at work so that's it that's where I
stand on this issue I think people are
still going to probably say oh he was
paid off by AMD or well he has no choice
now because everyone's pretty much
ditching until at this point x2 nine
nine what the heck was going on there I
just point to value where I see value
and I recognize that a lot of you
originally subscribed to the channel for
that budget orient
in process right you want to know what
the best bang for the buck configuration
is look money is just as important as
the products on which you spend the
money with that if you liked this video
