doubt from their low profile small
form-factor c7 to their top flow c1
mammoth to the r-1 cinderblock these are
all excellent coolers in their own
rights and I've reviewed and built with
all of them linked in this video's
description by the way but for those
looking into affordable yet beefy air
cooler some would say maybe the best
bang for the buck
the cryo rig h7 probably comes to mind
priced at only 35 USD it's an excellent
alternative to the ever-popular hyper
212 Evo it sports one less heat pipe
than the Evo but a considerably larger
heatsink now in this case Craig has yet
again outdone themselves maybe not so
much with the price of the product but
with the looks and the performance both
of those are much better with the new
rendition of the h7 cooler them about to
show you and that is the quad looming in
a nutshell the Keurig h7 quad Lumi
boasts four heat pipes versus three in
the previous model the same beautiful
thinner a and multi-zone RGB lighting
paired with a white LED fan this is one
of the best-looking tower coolers on the
market in my opinion and for an average
asking price it could be better I'll
admit it's boasting a 160 watt thermal
design of 20 watts from the previous h7
cooler full Ram high compatibility with
any chipset out of the box and support
for any socket type including the latest
a m4 series for horizon with a nickel
plated copper base and 40 aluminum fins
it'll handle any consumer grade CPU on
the market even overclocked it's also
extremely quiet but when we venture into
enthusiast grade territory I'm not
talking about 7700 K 1800 X I'm talking
about AI 970 900 X territory that kind
of CPU how well does this cooler hold up
we all know by now how hot the 7900 X
runs and that's why it's the perfect
candidate for this stress test so what
happens if we stick a 160 watt TDP
cooler on top of 140 watt CPU overclock
across the board to 4 gigahertz remember
a coolers required TDP for any given CPU
tends to increase exponentially as we
linearly increase v core and frequency
now we're talking about a 10 core 23 CPU
here all 10 cores overclocked to 4
gigahertz apiece
we're talking about massive power
consumption jumps and as a result a lot
of heat being dumped from the CPU so
think of this as a worst case scenario
the h7 quad looming this is by no means
a fair test it's not supposed to be but
this will handle any consumer grade
overclock period ok 7700 K 1800 X you
name it any overclock you can get with
an equivalent 120 maybe even 240 Mille a
IO you should be able to get with the h7
and keep temps in a similar range so
with the given settings the I 970 900 X
at 4 gigahertz across all 10 of its
cores and a standard fan curve set from
the bios the results in I 264 were well
they didn't do too well at 4 gigahertz
I'll just say that so right away the
temperature shot up to around 90 degrees
which was a bit alarming and very
quickly we reached a threshold at which
our CPU began to thermal throttle only
about 2% I didn't want it to go any
higher than that because this is a
really expensive CPU and I don't want to
ruin anything so I backed off the test
right away once it started thermal
throttling I figured that was that was
enough temperature across at least one
of the cores was 105 degrees Celsius so
yeah 4 gigahertz for the h7 quad Lumi on
the i9 is not gonna happen so the next
thing we did was really the only other
thing we could do without underclocking
the CPU that was run it at stock voltage
settings and its stock frequencies
across the board now there is turbo
boost enabled on the CPU actually turned
on turbo boost technology 3.0 which will
allow a single core to reach upwards of
4 point 5 gigahertz just a single core
though not across the board now but that
of course didn't happen when we stressed
all of the course equally in i-264 so in
a few instances a couple of cores would
reach 4 gigahertz but across the board
3.8 gigahertz was the standard and I ran
that test for 30 minutes and the cooler
did pass with flying colors these
results shouldn't be too surprising now
160 watt TDP cooler etapa CPU require
140 watt cooler is that's a green light
it's ok that 20 watt Delta is actually
what kept us under 90 degrees Celsius I
would say that if we had a TDP cooler
matching the TDP the CPU then we'd
probably be just on the edge of
t-junction at around 100 degrees or so
I've got to say though I am still very
impressed by the h7 quad movies
performance this is not a super beefy
air cooler but it's it's a decent size
and I expected that it would do okay
it's stock I didn't think it would
really allow for much overclocking
Headroom granted most a iOS still won't
allow for much overclocking Headroom
with the
nine and I talk about that in this video
right here okay so I've got my phone
about the same distance away from my
face as it is from the cooler and this
is under full load so this is while I
264 is running it's been running for
about thirty minutes now and you really
can't hear the cooler at all and this is
what the stock fan curve so if you're
wondering about how loud the cooler gets
under load especially in like a
worst-case scenario like this with a
very hot CPU no it's not a lot at all
and that's a very good thing so if
you've had any doubts about the CPU
coolers ability to keep your CPU well
cool all the while maintaining a
relatively low audio profile those
doubts shouldn't exist anymore all in
all I've got to say this is one heck of
an air cooler look it's a bit pricey I
understand that anything about 50 bucks
for around a hundred and forty hundred
and sixty watt TDP cooler is a bit
pricey but you're paying not only for
the coolers ability to dissipate heat
but also the RGB functionality and the
cohesion between the cooler and NZXT
scam software I didn't talk much about
this in the video because it's pretty
much a straightforward is changing the
LED config on in kraken x 62 or the NZXT
hue plus but it is nice to see in zxt
and cryo a kind of working together here
to bring you one just really fluid and
well-made product as always you can find
links to the h7 quad Lumi and the
regular cryo reek h7 in this video's
description let me know the comments
below what you think about both and what
your next air cooler purchase might
consist of if you like this video be
