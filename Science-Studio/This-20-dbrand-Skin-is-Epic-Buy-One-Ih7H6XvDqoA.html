incessant savagery on Twitter it's
something I personally admire they love
roasting people it's something I look up
to and it's worked out pretty well for
them so far check out how many followers
they have and this isn't just a result
of their excellent marketing strategies
it's because they make excellent
products I'm here to tell you that in
this video this is not sponsored in any
way by D brand I'm not being paid for
this review I'm not being compensated in
any other way that I can think of and
this skin was purchased by me out of
pocket so if I was dissatisfied by it I
would tell you upfront but I'm not
dissatisfied by the installation process
was a bit tricky you'll see that here in
a second but the end result is it's just
beautiful so that's what I want to get
to next installation it was not an easy
process and I didn't expect it to be I
always wondered how these people managed
to get their skins perfect on their
laptops and phones I always see pictures
being retweeted by D brand on Twitter
and I'm like how are they doing this how
are these people doing this it's not D
brand doing them a lot of these a lot of
these pictures are retweeting are just
customers who purchase the product and
then take pictures of the end result the
customers themselves are applying the
skins and now that I've done it for the
first time I'm actually impressed by
what some of these people were able to
do granted D brand does include
step-by-step tutorials for all of the
products they offer they're linked on
their website as well as YouTube so you
can check those out the one for the
galaxy s7 I've linked in the video
description if you are curious here's a
sample of that video typical D brand
humor is included have a listen begin by
installing the camera skin using a Glock
17 now that that's out of the way let's
apply the back piece remove the skin
from the 3m paper and reattach as shown
align around the camera flash and top
border once aligned properly apply
pressure to the exposed portion next
remove the 3m paper reattach as shown
and turn the phone upside down so apart
from the fact that a heat gun or hair
dryer is recommended for particularly
the corners of the skin from getting
these wet to wrap around the contours of
the phone they recommend using some sort
heatgun for that and that's because it's
difficult to get these skins to stretch
over curved surfaces as you can imagine
so that was something I didn't expect
going into it but I had one on hand I
just borrowed it from a friend it was a
girl I don't I don't own one myself even
though you probably think I do
I will admit though this took about
three or four tries to do particularly
the back skin that's the one I started
with first and you know some kind of
going in this cold turkey I was looking
at the tutorial but they make it seem so
much more so much more simple than it
actually is they'll say you know make
sure this is aligned properly and then
press firmly to secure the skin over the
phone and then they'll move on to the
next step well that's the part that
takes the longest to do so make sure you
pause the video and get this right
because if it's not right it's going to
bother you especially if you're someone
like me who's very OCD about things
being perfectly aligned if you have
trouble doing that if you don't have you
know very precise hands and you can't
hold things still this installation will
be difficult point-blank thankfully
though no major red flags on my fourth
attempt there is one bubble right there
you probably can't see it though even
with the camera zoomed in up close it's
very small and that's just the result of
me removing the skin three or four times
to get it aligned properly like anything
else especially screen protectors that
you have to you know be very particular
with on smooth surfaces you will get
bubbles if you continue removing things
and reapplying things the adhesive
weakens all that you should take into
consideration just make sure that you
align it as as closely to the contours
of the phone as you can the first time
and you won't have to deal with what I
dealt with I'm just I got impatient
because I I kept thinking I had it right
and then I start to lay it down and pull
it back and then sometimes it would
stick anyway and you know problems arise
okay my brother is here I'm going to see
if he can point out the flaws he's been
looking hard for about 15-20 seconds now
obviously I know where they are because
I'm the one who put it on there but to
somebody else who sees the phone for the
first time with the skin on with a
little bone yeah I found the bulb in
yeah I found the bomb part I mean clear
my feet
thank you yeah at the time actually I
wasn't going to count that ones upon if
you want to be picky where it's
off-centered is down here look at the
home button down there that's where
you'll see it see how at the top-left is
up kind of away from the button and
that's the only other issue I had the
only other flaw but apart from that it
turned out decent I'd say I what do you
think like an 80 85 out of 100 90 90
alright getting may alright I'm getting
an a cool the only other thing worth
mentioning especially for phone skins
that I didn't think about going into
this is the fact that the skin itself is
slightly thicker than a piece of paper
and this might vary from texture to
texture the d-brane offers but because
of this you can certainly feel where the
screen on your phone ends and the skin
begin so the screen is slightly recessed
into the phone it doesn't bother me but
it's not going to be a smooth surface
like you might expect on a random naked
phone I guess you could say so something
else to keep in mind other than that I
do think you will be 100% satisfied with
the skin the application is a royal pain
it just is but the end result I think is
worth it I do it all over again on
another phone I got hands down in fact I
don't think I'm never going to own a
phone that's not skinned ever again
because this looks beautiful it's just
unique granted a lot of people have this
white marble that I have here but it's
not a typical galaxy s7 anymore I love
that I love being different
that's what dbrand is for D branding
your phone and making it look the way
you want it to look if you liked this

give it a thumbs down if you feel the
complete opposite or if you hate
