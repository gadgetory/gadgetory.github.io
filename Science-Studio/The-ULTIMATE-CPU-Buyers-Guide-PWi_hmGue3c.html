probably the first thing you decide on a
building your own computer and for good
reason in most cases the CPU is the
deciding factor for how much money you
should spend on other components the
graphics card system Ram and even the
power supply so this video will revolve
around my personal experiences with each
of these I have tested and benchmarked
every single one so much of what I say
will be fact I have several videos in
this description to support what I say
but without a doubt my conclusions
overall will be more of a matter of
opinion how much bang for the buck I
think you're getting for each of these
processors and why you'd want to buy one
over the other we've got a pyramid here
so let's start from the bottom the least
expensive and work our way up
first up on the pyramid the Pentium G
4400 if you're willing to consider base
clock overclocking this makes the G 4400
a skylake version of the G 32:58 and
overclockable dual-core processor it
isn't boasting hyper-threading nor a
large amount of l3 cache but it packs a
heck of a punch with its two cores and
for half the price of its hyper threaded
counterpart if you ask me it's worth
considering four builds ranging anywhere
from three hundred to five hundred US
dollars for more on the G 4400
specifically check out the corresponding
video I have linked in this description
next up is the FX 6300 another
budget-friendly option no doubt it's
more powerful than the G 4400 by all
respects but unless you can find one for
around the price of a G 4400 I recommend
staying away for now and here's why it
utilizes the outdated am3+ socket ddr3
and PCI Express 2.0 don't get me wrong
it handles games no problem my brother
and I'm sure many of you still use the
6300 but at this point in time with Zen
just around the corner mind you and
competitive options from the blue team
just just straight flooding the market I
can't recommend any CP from AMD at this
time the same goes for the FX 8300
6100 I prove that right here it still
compromises the upgrade factor that the
skylight platform practically owns at
this point if you're on a very tight
budget however finding these on sites
like eBay for well under 100 US dollars
could be viable in my opinion you
shouldn't pay any more than about 60 US
dollars for the FX 6300 and maybe 70 to
80 bucks for an FX 8300
to the odd child the i3 I've owned both
the i3 4150 from has well and the i3
6100 from sky lake the 4150 was in the
first PC I ever built by the way but
upon comparing them to their i5
counterparts again videos linked in this
description I found that the i3 s felt
vastly short of the quad cores and it's
because of that I 5s have 4 physical
cores allowing for four lanes of
simultaneous prepping and processing but
hyper-threading doesn't make up for what
is lost in the i3 s I explain why in a
video right here all in all I will save
this if you can afford in any way shape
or form to shell out the extra 60 to 80
bucks for an i-5 over and i3 do it even
if
really under clocked I five like the
6,400 sitting around here somewhere
will perform much better than even a
base clock overclocked I 360 104
physical cores really do make all the
difference I know that money's tight and
the prices can vary from country to
country but I'd be willing to compromise
on other aspects of my build the case
and power supply for starters to make
room for an i-5 for gaming in my opinion
either goji 4400 on an ultra budget
option or i-5 you'll get more bang for
your buck the i3 is the awkward
middleman it's strategically priced buy
until they do that for a reason so about
twice as expensive as the G 4400 but
nowhere near twice as powerful as the
two core to thread counterpart and now
on to the i-5 I've only 4690k the sixty
four hundred and sixty five hundred and
sixty six hundred K skews all of them
offer unique competitive advantages the
4690k utilizes older architecture and an
older platform i know i harped on the FX
series for that but hear me out here if
you can find it for a good deal less
than that skylight counterpart I say go
for it here's why you won't notice any
substantial difference between the two
I have a video verifying that in this
description the same can be said of the
4460 here although you'll have no
possibility of base clock overclocking
even a locked i5 will perform better
than an overclocked I three and I threes
aren't naturally overclockable I said
the base clock method is really the only
way to get around that and that's only
on a skylight platform but if you're
choosing between 4464 somewhere around
150 hundred sixty US dollars and $120 I
340 150 go for the 4460 eat that $40
cost you'll definitely read the extra
benefits for the sake of utilizing ddr4
skylake chipsets and newer more
efficient architecture however opting
for either the sixty four hundred sixty
five hundred sixty six hundred or sixty
six hundred K may be in your best
interest I've owned every Scylla Kai
five except for the non K sixty six
hundred for the simple reason that from
my point of view the added cost doesn't
really justify the marginal frequency
increase that and base clock
overclocking is viable for all three if
you're willing to throw down a bit more
for a z170 chipset or any of as rocks
sky overclocking motherboards more on
that here in my personal opinion the
best bang for the buck CPU you can buy
for gaming
des is the i-5 6500 coming in at around
180 to 190 US dollars currently although
you can find it on sale for much less if
you're looking pretty much every day
it'll bring a high enough frequency with
turbo boost in a sufficient amount of
cores and cash to the table even better
you aren't necessarily obligated to pair
it with an expensive z170 motherboard or
a premium Ram kit now the 6600 K is
intended for an entirely different user
it has an unlock multiplier meaning that
you really don't have to do much in
terms of tweaking things in your BIOS to
get this thing up to around four point
four to four point six gigahertz with a
decent cooler but as i've proven in a
video i have linked in this description
i have tons of videos linked there just
bear with me cpu overclocking really
doesn't change much when it comes to
just gaming so why would a gamer
purchase this well for one they're
actually great multitaskers while not as
efficient as its 6700 K counterpart it
can be easily overclocked to upwards of
4.6 gigahertz with a solid air or water
cooler this will aid in content creation
tasks all time reductions and even
multitasking operations in principle
you'll also be somewhat forced to
purchase a z170 motherboard more
expensive yes but offering many more
features as well as a line crossfire 5.1
surround sound adequate cooling
solutions not to mention they look
better as well I don't recommend at 6600
K for 95% of gamers you simply won't see
a great enough increase in performance
to justify the price hike but if you're
consistently switching between both
video games and content creation
software the 6600 K can be that viable
compromise you've been looking for in
your case $100 will go a much further
way for a better GPU than it will for a
better CPU that is to say choosing this
over this makes much more sense for the
avid gamer and even occasional content
creator take it from someone like myself
I pretty much edited rendered on all of
these processors in the studio and I can
tell you without a doubt that these two
are fairly close when it comes to cost
or performance that ratio there for
editing and rendering the framerate
differences are minimal and the Edit
render time differences aren't great
enough in my opinion for the $100 Delta
to make sense for anyone who just
occasionally edits and renders videos
now in the midst of the whole I 5 verse
i7 discussion again I have several
videos already covering those
head-to-head mashups in comes the
sneaky old Seon I'll be completely
honest with you here I've only owned one
and I'll tell you why
motherboard options I had to hunt for
one I liked and ended up switching
halfway through the process see 232 and
see 236 motherboards are the only ones
currently supporting skylake Zeon's not
to be confused with Broadwalk ez ons
which is disappointing seeing as though
haswell's Aeons were 100% compatible
with consumer grade motherboards not the
case here to limit this selection even
further if you intend to base clock
overclocked a Xeon like this one you'll
need to purchase one of asrock special
sky overclocking motherboards for the c
232 chipset these Zeon's also don't
offer integrated graphics meaning that
you'll get no picture on your monitor
unless you're sporting a dedicated
graphics card in most cases it won't
really apply to you but if you plan on
waiting 2 or 3 weeks for your graphics
card to arrive after the fact keep in
mind that you won't be able to use your
computer until that car it arrives so
then Greg with all these drawbacks why
the heck would I want to purchase one of
these the answer is price let's consider
this one the Xeon e3 1230 v5 it features
14 nanometers Gothic architecture 4
cores 8 threads 8 megabytes of l3 cache
turbo boost technology and low thermal
design power all identical to the i7
6700 stock frequencies vary slightly but
these can be negated with simple base
clock / clocks and that brings us to the
i7 6700 K perhaps my favorite processor
not because of the price necessarily but
because of how versatile this thing
actually is it's only a little over 300
US dollars but it can pretty much do
anything you wanted to do apart from you
no serious serious workloads if you
aren't willing to compromise on an
unlocked multiplier I understand base
clock overclocking isn't for everyone
then look no further than the 6700 K I
mean that firmly look no higher up the
chain than the 6700 K I know I know CPUs
like the 6800 K look tempting right Oh 6
cores well it's a 6 core consumer grade
processor granted on an enthusiast grade
platform it is a bit more expensive but
seems worth it right I'm getting 2 extra
cores and 4 extra threads yeah I could
definitely reap those benefits right
look here's my point the 6700 K will
crunch even 4k footage with relative
ease take my word for it I do it on a
daily basis
it handles any game you throw at it and
over
clocks like a beast I've gotten mine up
to 4.8 gigahertz with albeit slightly
sketchy temperatures I've only gone up
to the 6700 K for the simple reason that
it offers the best of both worlds like
it's been proven time and time again
that the 6700 K thanks to its very
strong single core performance
outperform is even the 6800 K 59 30 K
and even 69 50 X and nearly $2,000
processor in many cases and until games
begin heavily relying on more than four
physical cores don't worry forget a ways
to go the 67 higher case price roughly
330 US dollars will be the most I ever
spend on a CPU with which I intend to
play video games when it comes to
rendering sure the more cores with a
decent frequency you throw at it the
better off you'll be
in long-run the experience will just be
more enjoyable but I only recommend
these processors in very very extreme
cases
hence x99 the X standing for extreme you
get my point
if you want the best computing
experience possible to be completely
honest even the 69 50 X will fall short
of multi-core multi CPU Z on platforms
worth tens of thousands of dollars
you'll never get the best folks it's
that's how technology works now if you
don't play video games that are only
interested in content creation you could
make a case for the 6800 K and maybe
something like the 69 hundred K but
that's as far as I'd ever be willing to
go and I've stayed away from X 99 for
that very reason the costs in my
experience outweigh the benefits of
reduced render times and smoother
editing among other things and that's
that I know we've gone above my personal
CPU pyramid at this point but I wanted
to make sure that I touched on
enthusiast grade chips and explain why
I've shied away from them up to this
point for what I do and what I imagine
close to 99% of you do as well any CPU
up to the 6700 K will suffice and
certainly yield a greater performance
per dollar ratio so that's my take you
don't have to agree with everything I've
just said I understand that there are
some power users very specific power
users I didn't mention in this video but
I've owned every single one of these
processors every single one you're
looking at right now in this pyramid I
have owned that I've tested extensively
so I have a pretty good idea of what
processor works well for what user if
you have any questions concerns or
issues leave them in the comments
section below and myself or someone else
can address them if you liked or at
least appreciate the video be sure to
give it a thumbs up let me
you think it a good job they did a bad
job or for some reason hit everything my
life I understand some people like that
give two thumbs down if you feel the
first way they'll be sure to subscribe
