been looking forward to since we first
saw it at Computex 2018 it comes in
several SKUs and can range in price from
40 bucks to get this all the way up to
$75 so is it worth your cash for
starters I highly recommend the
addressable RGB version of this case but
not for the reason you might think LEDs
aside this case looks substantially
better with a dedicated PSU shroud or
basement which everyone will call it
something you'll for go in the cheaper
non addressable version for some reason
and currently new I guess selling both
for the same price so it's kind of a
no-brainer to pick the one with the
basement in my opinion the option to
stock the re RGB fans with the case is a
nice touch though you will pay an extra
thirty or so US dollars I do wish though
that more manufacturers would give the
buyer the option to include generic case
fans in this case the fans themselves
aren't the most premium in terms of
performance or sound but they're not
crap and they look super cool in this
chassis thanks to the tempered glass
front panel there are also pwm fans so
you'll have full control over RPMs and
your BIOS meaning you can run them super
quiet when things aren't under load and
if I'm not mistaken these are the same
fans you'll find included with other
addressable products from beef cool
including the castle and captain pro 240
a iOS but my impressions of this case
straight out of the box were a bit mixed
to be honest you can tell that the
company simply added to the very cheap
chassis it's a bit like stashing a beefy
stereo system into a Ford Pinto I mean
it might sound great while driving but
deep down you still know it's a forward
Pinto take these rear slot covers for
example they are very cheap not the kind
that you can reinsert after removal you
kind of have to keep twisting them until
they detach from the frame this is what
you would normally expect in a $40.00
enclosure and this is also in the $40.00
enclosure though the $75 case also
includes these if you want the
addressable RGB and the basement
included so it's it's kind of
frustrating because you have no choice
but to spend 75 bucks on a case that has
this garbage at the rear and this again
just comes down to the design choice and
the way that the pool decided to stack
their SKUs for this particular product
there also aren't rubber grommets
anywhere in this case meaning things
will look
a little less clean when it's all set
and built check it out right here I cram
tons of expensive hardware into this
thing just to test the theory and even
with custom cables the lack of grommets
just it becomes pretty obvious cable
routing holes are oddly shaped more like
squares and oddly placed as well I also
noticed quite a bit of dust in my sample
not sure if this is standard or just
leftover from the production process but
it was very annoying to clean nothing I
would expect in say a $75 enclosure but
not all is bad with this one I feel like
I'm just pointing down all the negatives
at one time but there are quite a number
of pros and I think they do outweigh the
cons with this case you get the
dedicated basement a cutout big enough
for a 360 mile combo USB and HD audio
cut out to cut out in front of the PSU
if you're into that sort of thing
sufficient cable routing space behind
the motherboard tray and two tempered
glass panels to top things off the front
panel is slightly more tinted than the
left panel which I really don't mind
here one thing that is missing is a
black trim around the Left panel however
as is you can see straight through the
case underneath black trim would have
looked pretty clean in my opinion should
have been included with the especially
the $75 version there's also only one
Deepu logo that I can find and it rests
toward the bottom of the front glass
it's subtle and appreciated I like it a
lot the case stands tall on for rigid
feet and an included dust filter
underneath keeps power supplies nice and
clean though it's a relatively cheap
dust filter at that speaking of power
supply is one thing I noticed when
building was that space back here was
fairly limited I couldn't fit my EVGA P
to unit since it was too long and my g3
unit barely fit the included hard drive
cage is riveted and thus not removable
unless you plan on drilling thing so use
PS use with dimensions equal to or
smaller than the typical ebj and g3 unit
by the way the matrix 55 did include all
necessary mounting screws but no zip
ties were included with my sample which
is a shame because they're very cheap to
include for one and the case is littered
with tie points for two which is a good
thing but that said I was pleasantly
surprised about how easy it was to cable
manage here there's plenty of space
about an inch or just over that so maybe
three centimeters or so and you know
sliding that right panel on was a breeze
top IO is pretty straightforward
loaded power and reset switches feel
pretty good to press along with a
dedicated LED toggle headphone and audio
jacks to USB to ports and a single USB 3
don't expect type-c ports and $40.00
enclosures that just that's ridiculous
the LED toggle is fitted with around 20
presets you won't have full control here
but you can switch between several
different colors and effects I'm not
sure if you can integrate this with
motherboard software to control it all
at one time although there is an extra
cable hanging from this little bunch
here so if you want to connect
additional hardware that does support
the addressable function you could
certainly do that additional support in
the case includes various mounting
positions of top for fan and radiator
mounting flexibility I was able to mount
a 240 ml a IO up top by utilizing the
rails positioned closest to the left
panel so as to avoid any conflicts with
my 8 pin EPS cables and BRM heat sinks
you can even slide the cooler forward or
backward assuming you have sufficient
tube length I love this kind of
flexibility especially in chief cases
like these I'm glad deep cool one on
board with this the company also
includes a rear cover next to these
phony PCI slot covers that we talked
about earlier for additional isolation
they aren't needed but they are a nice
touch
included thumb screws here and holding
the right panel aren't captive and are
comprised of plastic but they're there
nonetheless I'm not going to complain
two hard drives can be mounted under new
basement and two additional SSD mounting
points are positioned to the right of
the motherboard standoffs one problem I
have here however is that the cutouts
for these drives which again are oddly
shaped you'll have to share by the way
with the 24 pin USB 3 and SATA interface
are not perfectly sized for SSD ports
meaning that your cables will look a bit
you know crunched when funneled through
these openings they just don't line up
perfectly with the SATA power and SATA
data cable ports on the SSDs instead I
would have liked to have seen SSD mounts
on let's say the top of the basement or
behind the motherboard tray instead and
we'll close this one out with airflow
nothing to stellar here you've probably
expected that the tempered front panel
blocks airflow perpendicular to fan
blades and we're left instead with these
filtered grills running down the left
and right side of the front panel when
air has to make a 90-degree turn into
any chamber pressure drops accordingly
and we're seeing that
our thermal tests airflow is slightly
reduced and the graphics card in our
case ran approximately six degrees
hotter with the front panel installed
versus removed and the cpu which is
being cooled by a top mounted a i/o mind
you ran a five degrees hotter with this
same arrangement all in all these aren't
devastating numbers by any means but
heavy overclockers should keep this in
mind in summary though I don't think
this is a bad case I am just a bit
confused by deep cool skew tactics here
the bare-bones matrix 55 costs only 40
bucks pricing itself into a league of
its own
but it comes without a basement or any
decent fan the $75 version includes the
basement and three solid fans but fails
to upgrade other aspects of the
enclosure like the rear slot covers and
rubber grommets things we take for
granted in other similarly priced cases
so at this price point it really
competes with the likes of the fractal
design define and mesh if I see tge
cases which run so recently for Black
Friday Cyber Monday that's a problem
because in my opinion fractal does it
way better here than deep cool dust for
the price and I think for the $40
enclosure it's just too bare-bones for
anyone outside of tempered glass
enthusiasts I mean if that's all you
truly want in a chassis then the $40
version I'm sure is gonna be
satisfactory for you but I imagine most
consumers will opt for the version with
the basement and RGB fans it's just the
current trend we're in and I feel deep
cool at this point is competing with the
big players in the mid tower market so
like I said definitely buy the
addressable RGB version of this case
I've linked it along with its other
variants down below but if you're
interested in saving an extra 30 or so
bucks opt out of the RGB fan inclusion
there like I said these and fans but 30
bucks for those I mean really all you
needs an AI upfront or something similar
and then a rear exhaust fan it could be
just a cheap one it doesn't really
matter it'll keep your costs down and
you'll still get that basement down
below that's my take what do you guys
think let me know down below you guys
something to do thumbs up if you liked
it dislike it because we drops of
feeling or hate everything about life

haven't already become a member if you
want to be fancy and we'll catch you in
the next video this is science studio
thanks for that's awkward thanks for
building we built in this case we
reviewed it we learn a couple things
didn't we
yeah thanks for doing all those things I
don't know if I should refilm this now
I'm not going to refill this machine
illegal imma leave it as is</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
