this is one of those days what's up
everyone honest review here of the deep
cool captain 240 X now the 120 X which
is a 120 millimeter radiator variant
also applies in this case now let's not
say that my reviews my other reviews
aren't honest I just call things like I
see them I had a lot of experience with
knees particular AOS also with ins exta
iOS Corsair AOS they all have about the
same reliability we're going to talk
about quality control I know you're kind
of worried about deep cool which is a
brand it's not as big let's be honest as
Corsair or NZXT or any of the other big
a io companies out there we're gonna
talk about that why I like this more
than any of the other areas out there
and where you can find it now one of the
captains big selling points for me the
fact that you can buy it in a white
variant guys I know I am with white pcs
the fact you can shine any RGB color you
want at a white surface and it takes on
that color scheme so having a white PC
means that you can pretty much have any
color scheme you want going on inside
that white build now the captain 240 X
comes in a black and red variant but
also in a white Baron so not only are
the fans themselves white we'll talk
about the fans here shortly but also the
radiator itself and at a CPU block so
you have a full-on white color scheme
going on here if you're looking to build
any white PC period this is probably the
AIO for you at least in the looks
department now let's be honest about
fans here for a second if you purchased
a case from any retailer anywhere in the
world within the last year or so and
paid under one hundred US dollars
equivalent I would bet my lunch money
that the fans included in those cases
were not up to par I bet you they were
pretty crappy to be honest and that's
because you buy the case for the case
you don't buy the case for the fans so
there's really no incentive for
companies to throw an expensive fans
because they know that's not why you're
buying the case it might be an extra
selling point but it's not really going
to sway you one way or the other but in
the case of a iOS you want good fans one
of the reasons why you buy one in the
first place is to not have to hear those
loud fans turning any time you start up
a game and i/o will solve a lot of that
if you calibrate your fan curves
accordingly now I have received a few
from companies that had not-so-great
fans and I can say that the fans from
deep cool included with the captain 240
and 120 X's are satisfactory they're not
the greatest they're not the
crappiest I would say that they're
somewhere in the middle I'd give them a
c-plus maybe a B minus they get
especially loud passed about 50 to 60%
rpm but being that you're cooling your
CPU with a liquid it's not probably
going to be an issue if you're not
overclocking your CPU to some insane
frequency another great thing about
these fans for pins a lot of companies
will cheap out and include three pin
fans I'm not a fan of those fans I
prefer four pins because it allows for
extra control pwm support which is what
the fourth pin gives you allows for
basically a wider range of RPM settings
you can turn your fans way down and also
turn them way up need be so if you're
calibrating your fans and your BIOS
having that PWM support is a good thing
because you can really lower those
settings without dropping voltage to a
point where the fan won't even turn on
now if you were asking where on earth
they put the pumps in a iOS typically
it'll be in the CPU block it won't be
above the rad fins that wouldn't really
make much sense if there's really no
where else it could be but right above
the CPU block you have copper base here
with pre applied thermal paste that's a
good sign
you'll find the pump it provides decent
cooling this is a little under what the
NZXT kraken X 62 will bring you but
that's a 280 millimetre rata but still
able to get my I 760 700 K to 4.6
gigahertz on this particular a i/o so
you're still going to have excellent
overclocking Headroom on a personal note
I'm glad this only requires one
connection the NZXT kraken 62 has a
plethora of wire streaming from it you
have to cable manage all of that if you
want to look semi-decent otherwise
you'll just have black wires kind of
flying everywhere on top of your
motherboard but in this case only a
single three pin fan header that's
perfectly fine three pins is okay for a
pump because typically you want that
running somewhere around full speed
anyway on the top of the block depending
on which color scheme you opt for you'll
either have in this case a white pulsing
LED or a red pulsing LED to kind of fit
with your color scheme obviously if
you're going with the black variant then
you might want to have something red in
your case to complement that red LED in
this case white pretty much matches
everything unless you know nothing else
in your system is white in which case
this would really stand out but I don't
know if I would look all that bad to be
completely honest with you two other
things regarding this coolers
flexibility well in one sense of the
word the first being that there is no
company
logo or text anywhere atop the CPU block
that's good for those who are looking to
route this excess tubing atop the case
let's say you have a case it's pretty
short you have all this extra tubing
here instead of running it down just
above your graphics card which let's
admit looks a little goofy you can run
it on top and it'll pretty much be
hidden from view and by doing so you've
kind of minimalized the the look of your
case you haven't got these random tubes
running anywhere and you don't have any
upside down text or anything that's
sideways you know if you have like an
ends exe cracking next to let's say the
NZXT logos oriented in one direction you
can't rotate that thing any other way
unless you are ok with crooked or
upside-down text and that's just a pet
peeve that a few people have in this
case you don't have to worry about that
one bit the second flexible feature is
actually a bad thing for especially
large cases like full-size towers if you
want to use a 240 AO in that kind of
case this is probably not the case that
a IO for you I say that because the
piping itself is not very long this was
designed for mid-sized and I TX cases
you'll find that the NC XD cracking neck
62 I keep using as like my standard
because that's still a really good a oh
it's just there are things about this
cooler that suit my needs personally but
that coolers CPU block actually extends
a few inches further which means that
you'll have extra compatibility in that
case you might not be able to reach your
CPU in an especially large case if you
want to orient you know if you want to
orient this block any which way so
that's actually not very long at all by
the way if you're wondering about ease
of installations is one of the simplest
processes to follow you even have
pictures here that will help you through
the process and if you're wondering
about am for support for rising CPU
owners deep cool cap into 40 II X's now
come with am for support that's
something they wanted to make sure that
I touched on that you have that support
out of the box now just make sure that
you're not buying a really old unit from
a friend that one won't come with it
because a m4 is now released the equals
updated it and you can use 240 and 120
X's with rising platforms now let the
heck you actually get a four fan fan hub
with the captain 240 X that's pretty
cool I think I might have thrown all of
mine away in the past I didn't know that
this was in the box now lastly I want to
talk about quality control reliability
of this product it's a slippery slope
because I can only speak
my personal experience I haven't had a
single AIO fail granted deep pool has
sent me four of them I purchased two on
my own from new egg and Amazon so those
were okay too and the ones that I assume
deep pool sent were checked beforehand
to make sure that they weren't dead on
arrival but there are and I cannot
ignore this several reviews saying that
these coolers have failed within a month
or so or we're just dead out of the box
but I want you to take those negative
reviews with a small grain of salt I'm
not saying it because deep pools a
sponsor or because they paid me in this
video they didn't by the way this is
just me doing a review on the captain
240 and 120 X's because many of you have
asked about them I use them quite a bit
what I will say though with the negative
reviews they're motivated think about it
if you spend a hundred bucks on a
product and it doesn't work as
advertised you're going to be pretty
pissed off you can want to go write a
review on whatever website that you
purchase the product from but if the
product works as advertised and it you
know does we expect it to do you're
probably not going to be motivated to
hop back onto that site and write a
decent review so the people who write
negative reviews are motivated to do so
and I'm glad that they do it lets us
know that there are potential issues but
the positive reviews you can't really
count on unless they just you know
unless those people were blown away by
the products you know performance and
this is just a 240 millimeter AIO it's
nothing really special about it other
than the fact that it looks pretty darn
cool worst case you purchase the product
from a reputable vendor I recommend a
New Ager Amazon for the US because you
can return those products within X
amount of days if they do fail and I'll
refund your money or they'll send you
another one and that's pretty much it
your cpu temps will rise and rise until
your computer turns off which is what
it's supposed to do when safe temps are
exceeded and then you can just get your
money back or try something else or try
the same cooler over again but I would
not recommend this product if I was
uncertain at all about its potential I
do think that a majority of you will be
very impressed by the cooler regardless
of which size you go for the 120 or the
240 I do think that the 240 is worth it
it's more expensive but it's not double
the price so it's like buy one get one
25% off or whatever
speaking of which both the captain 240 X
and the captain 120 X are linked in this
video's description along with their red
and white variants check those out if
you have one let me know what you think
about it if you had issues also let me
know I'd like to keep track of all those
and see what we can do on deep cool side
to sort out those issues they're a very
good company very
on its very reputable they're just
trying to find their place in the
current market and I'd say with the
captain 240 X they literally hit the
nail on the head this is a very good AIO
for a very good price that's why it's my
personal AIO
of choice if you liked this video be
sure to give it a thumbs up thumbs down
