studio so a few videos ago you may
recall a video that I uploaded detailing
the painting process behind one of my
older computers it was based on the i3
6100 and was built inside of a white
NZXT s340 case I had painted everything
in there from the graphics card like the
entire graphics card I had to
disassemble everything to the vrm he
sings to the solid state drive trays and
even the ddr4 I had painted completely
white I ended up calling the color
scheme cocaine white even though I
obviously do not condone the
recreational use of cocaine right this
video here is going to expand upon that
idea just a little bit we're not going
to paint any PC parts in particular at
least the parts that are in a case like
that but we're going to paint some
peripherals so basically things that
aren't physically inside the PC but that
work with the PC all the time so in this
case I decided to paint my keyboard now
you're thinking that doesn't sound very
smart Greg how you gonna paint a
keyboard you got a lot of keys in there
and you have to disassemble everything
well yeah I did have to disassemble
everything that was just part of the
process but I think that the results
kind of made up for the amount of time
that I had put into it and the six or
seven bucks that I paid for the paint so
let's get right to it I don't want to
keep you too long I know that the last
painting video was super long this one's
not gonna be that long so let's jump
right into the painting process and the
steps that I had to go through to make
it look like this okay that's all you
can see of it now let's get the painting
the very first thing I decided to do
before anything else was take a picture
of the keyboard with my phone and this
would come in handy later for
reassembling each individual key under
the keyboard itself if you don't believe
me now you'll believe me shortly the
keyboard we're using here is pretty old
made by Lenovo and honestly not all that
special so my feelings won't be hurt if
this paint job in particular goes south
I unplugged it from the back of my
computer tower and then flipped it onto
its back side from here 14 screws had to
be removed and they essentially held the
top frame to the bottom frame so just
they kind of just
sandwich them together and since we'll
only be looking at the keyboard from the
front I mean most of the time I don't
know why you'd ever look at your
keyboard from down below
we'll just be painting the top of the
keyboard so we'll be saving some paint
and we'll also be saving some time as
well now each of the keys on this
keyboard were held mechanically into
place in the top frame which meant that
I had to manually remove each one of
them individually to flexible grooves
held each onto the board so what I did
was just grab a pair of tweezers and
essentially squeeze each pair of grooves
together they were basically just acting
like a locking mechanism and once they
were squeezed together the key would
fall straight through the frame and onto
a styrofoam sheet that I laid underneath
it to keep all the keys in order this
would make the reassembly process move
much quicker as well so if you can try
to keep these keys as in order as
possible even if they're backwards
because you'll just be able to pick one
up and then pick the next one up in that
line all the way down the keyboard it'll
save you a lot of time once each key was
finally removed I pulled out the only
remaining component that was that green
LED shield on the top right corner and
yeah just set that to the side don't
wanna paint that so all we have left now
is a large piece of plastic which is
exactly what we want it because we can
paint this entire thing so let's do that
let's paint it
I had a can of white Plasti Dip and a
can of Plasti Dip gloss to be applied
afterwards I made sure to shake the cans
vigorously before each coat was applied
and that pretty much just helps stir up
the liquid inside and prevent sudden
overspray stang application you
definitely don't want over sprays that's
yeah they're not fun to get rid of
remember to spray back and forth side to
side in a similar pattern with each coat
begin spraying away from the panel and
gently glide the can across it being
sure to stay around 6 to 10 inches away
from the panel with each pass drift to
close in this case and you could end up
without an odd looking paint splotches
something you don't want drift too far
away and you'll find yourself applying 8
or 10 coats before you actually see any
solid result so yeah we don't wanna
waste paint here we allowed roughly 30
to 45 minutes in between coats to ensure
that each previous coat was dry remember
in this case to not touch the paint when
it's wet you'll be left with an
irritating thumb
enter something like that that will
require many additional coats to remove
properly once we had an adequate number
of coats applied and dried onto the
panel we moved on over to our Plasti Dip
gloss now in this case we use liberal
amounts to give the white paint a more
glossy reflective finish obviously and
the more coats of gloss that were added
the shinier the result so if you're
looking for a matte finish just stay
away from this step completely you won't
need this at all the white plastidip
look just fine the way it is so when
everything is dried bring the panel back
inside and inspect it for any obvious
flaws this is essentially the point of
no return you're not going to want to
repeat everything all over again just
because you found a few spots that we're
lacking in paint depth I flipped the
front panel upside down and then refer
to the picture I took with my phone to
carefully reinsert each key into its
proper place holder the addition of the
paint did increase key resistance since
you know each area for the key slot was
slightly reduced but I still found it to
be tolerable I reinserted the green LED
cover at this point as well to finish
off the reassembly stage for the front
panel now with every key back in its
resting place I merged both the top and
bottom panels together again oh it's
another merge and secured them with the
14 screws I had set to the side after
plugging the keyboard back into the
system I tested each keys functionality
to ensure that everything was properly
contacting the paper than circuit
underneath I also gave it a real world
test on Microsoft Word only to shortly
conclude there after that I was very
satisfied with the ergonomic an
aesthetic appeal of the board now keep
in mind that if white is not your color
of choice there are several other
options to choose from Plasti Dip comes
in lime green red sunburst orange black
gray gold yellow blue for screen okay
you get the point
I chose plastic it because it's
removable but any paint intended for use
on plastics or I guess whatever material
your keyboard is made out of should be
just fine you'll just have to paint over
it again if you get tired of what you
already have the white in my case
matches the fantex evolved ITX case
right there if you miss that entire
build log video you can go ahead and
click the link here if you want to just
see a simple review of this case in
particular you can click the link here
can I have to move in
here so you can see both of them but
yeah I think you'll enjoy either of
those videos you can see them already go
and check them out I think you will like
them so let me know what do you think
now obviously painting something like a
keyboard is not going to be up
everyone's alley in fact I'm fairly
confident that a few of you think this
idea is just completely stupid and
should never have been pursued in the
first place
but nonetheless I'm happy with the
result and that's really all that
matters you know other people's opinions
about things that you do to your own
personal items don't matter as long as
you think it looks cool go right on so I
encourage you go out and paint something
doesn't have to be a keyboard or a
computer mouse or even all the parts
inside of a PC just you know something
something that you don't really care
much about that you think would become
more appealing if you painted it
something like that it's a it's a
project to consider at least just be
careful as you'll assume all risk for
anything you do to any item that you own
ah see how I squeeze that disclaimer in
there not bad huh hmm I appreciate the
watch if you enjoyed the video you know
if you truly did be sure to thumb it up
we appreciate all this thumbs up but if
you hated the video think we should
never do this again
thumb it down let us know in the
comments below why you thumbed it down
what you thought was done wrong or what
you would like to see more improved in
future videos
you know just start discussions down
below I enjoy some of the common chains
that are going on I mean some get pretty
crazy that FX 6300 versi 360 100 comment
chain is getting a little out of hand
and I frankly cannot keep up with I
think we're like over a thousand
comments at this point I just so anyway
be sure to subscribe if you haven't
already I appreciate all views and all
the videos that we have up so far and
stay tuned we have an i5 4460 has well
build coming very very soon
this is science studio thanks for
learning with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
