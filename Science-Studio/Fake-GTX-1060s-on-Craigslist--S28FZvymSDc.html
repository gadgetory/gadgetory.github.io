unfortunately fake graphics cards are
now being sold on sites like Craigslist
here's how to spot them so for people
who don't live in one of these 70 or so
countries in which it's supported
Craigslist is an advertisement website
similar in concept to say good old gam
tree
these aren't eBay replacements per se
because they're generally localized
meaning you'll have to meet in person if
you plan to do any due diligence at all
the reason why eBay has been so
successful among other things is its
buyer protection guarantee if you buy a
product that doesn't hold up to the
sellers claims eBay's got your back
most of the time they're the
intermediary and ensure that most scams
are handled appropriately and they've
been doing a decent job at this thus far
I mean if they weren't nobody would use
eBay right so I bought a fake graphics
card just a few months ago and was
covered by eBay protection after about a
month worth of disputing that's not too
long when seen in the context of how
many you know disputes happen on a daily
basis you can check more out in this
video right here but in general eBay has
you covered if you buy something on
Craigslist and it turns out not to be
what you thought it was that's your own
fault right that excludes the whole you
know false advertising misrepresentation
thing that you could probably sue people
for but in general you know if it turns
out not to work and you had the job
right of checking it beforehand before
you actually exchanged the cash for the
product then that one's on you now I'd
like to think total wind up on Twitter
for bringing this to my attention we've
blurred out any personal info in this ad
just to be safe but the title reads
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10 63 gigabyte new
GPUs cheap nothing like your daily dose
of clickbait right and when you see
anything like this particularly on
Craigslist one of two things likely
crosses your mind either a these are
scammers who plan on shipping you the
cards once you've actually paid via
Western Union or some other sketchy
method or B these cards are defective
and unless you show up at this random
person's house or bring a system with
you verifying the integrity of these
cards will be next to impossible so you
see the catch there but a closer
inspection reveals a third possibility
these aren't gtx 1060 s at all but how
do you know Greg just because we've
never seen as a particularly SRAM four
to 1060 doesn't mean it's automatically
a fake stop being a you know snob well
let's start with the
sellers description and look for any red
flags there are plenty of them by the
way and we already know how the title
sounds just a little click Beatty and I
mean when you see 50 bucks for cards as
it usually sell for around three hundred
dollars that's got to be one huge red
flag right there right so here's how it
reads I have twenty gtx 1060 s I never
used for a project so it's time for a
new haul they were made by a different
company but using video boards this is
when the ten sixty s were three to four
hundred dollars each so I bought these
these ones with the cheaper looking
shrouds at around half the price I have
the boxes and drivers what P's got the
CDs okay so does anything at all sound
suspicious here let's start with the
first line I have twenty gtx 1060 s I
never used for a project I mean come on
this may be a stretch but it sounds to
me like this dude assuming it's a guy
planned on doing some serious mining
with these cards and was terribly
disappointed when he found out they
weren't actually ten sixties and in fact
he might have done this there's
ultimately no way to tell but he does
accept cryptocurrency as a form of
payment so I'd say it's probably likely
he also says that they were made by a
different company but doesn't say which
and that's because he has absolutely no
idea who made these obviously they use
Nvidia boards but the boards themselves
aren't ten sixty boards I can tell you
that straight up and more specifically
the GPUs in question aren't GP 106's
which is what they should be if they're
supposed to be ten sixties one way we
can tell is by looking at the rear
display connections now conveniently the
seller doesn't show a clear shot of the
rear but we can line up the same shroud
design with this one we found on eBay
this is also a scam by the way and it's
not a real 10 50 TI so don't get your
hopes up this has the same black shroud
with blue trim as well as the same fan
setup and we can somewhat match the rear
connection docks one is clearly a DVI
port and the other slightly smaller one
unless I'm vastly misinformed is a VGA
port so this is what it looks like from
the side and I'll tell you straight up
that nothing in the gtx 960 department
looks anything like this you wouldn't
have VGA ports for starters and limiting
users to only a single HDMI port without
any reference to DisplayPort at all
would never make sense on a gtx 1060
since these cards are used frequently
for high refresh rate gaming case in
point if you see these connections
attributed to any gtx 1050 TI or 1060
flag the post and walk away
you know click the back button you know
what I mean now if you still aren't sold
on the fact that these are fake let's
try to find identical boards with
different GPUs this eBay listing for
what's supposed to be a 1050 I list
contradicting expects boasting quote
ddr5 a four gig buffer and a maximum
supported resolution of 2048 by 1044
that's far below true 1050 Ti potential
another dead giveaway is the single SLI
finger I mean come on they can't even
spell correctly and don't let these
stickers for you I noticed these later
on and they do seem convincing GTX 1060
3 GD 5 192 bit they've even got a
barcode which I'm sure scans to a dead
end website but other features in this
card we've just looked through don't
lineup at all but any gtx 1060 on the
market and that's why you should stay
away if something seems fishy it
probably is now judging from the PCB
layout it's very likely this card is
actually a gtx 550 ti or 650 TI or GTS
450 that closest I could find was this
card here but many of the sports
components line up to what was depicted
in the ad a GPU matching what is likely
783 megahertz in this listing seems to
fit the description of the kepler family
so from a performance standpoint many of
these GPUs perform worse than current
model GT 1030 s nowhere close to this
fellas advertised claim of a GTX 1060 I
even tried texting this seller here with
an alias number asking whether or not he
knew that the cards he was trying to
sell were essentially counterfeits I
received no reply unfortunately so do us
all a favor next time you find yourself
browsing for graphics cards report any
of this garbage this may seem like old
news to many of us now but I guarantee
there are people out there looking for a
sweet deal who would buy all 20 from
this guy if they had the chance it's why
this video exists to point out the red
flags and because when something seems
too good to be true it usually is so
there's my closing statement question
everything folks what do you think if
this video thumbs up I thought was cool
share with your friends those especially
who might appear misinformed on the
surface and be sure to click that red
subscribe button now that really hurt if
you want to see more videos like this in
the future
