studio just recently picked up an LG
ultrawide monitor I have never used an
Ultra I wanted before and so I figured
now would be a good time to kind of do a
review and a first impressions video in
regards to the monitor itself so this is
the box sorts that it came in looks
pretty sweet this is the course 21 by 9
aspect ratio so a typical monitor will
feature a sixteen by nine or four by
three aspect ratio if you've seen a few
of my previous videos you'll know that
we used these monitors here these are
NEC monitors they're four by three
aspect ratio so if you double that make
that an eight by three aspect ratio
basically two of these stuck together
that's roughly the same aspect ratio
that you'll get from a monitor like this
this one in particular is the 29 inch
model so it's going to be 29 inches
diagonally what this means essentially
for an ultra-wide is that you're not
going to have very much height clearance
so the screen itself is not going to be
very high but it will be very long in
order to accommodate for that 29 inches
in the diagonal aspect and of course
being an LG IPS display you're going to
see pretty phenomenal viewing angles
with these the monitor does have an
anti-glare coating please don't peel it
off even though it looks like it could
peel off it's not a screen protector so
if you are viewing your monitor for
whatever reason indirect or even in
direct sunlight you won't notice any
color fading as a result so what we've
done is basically unboxed it you
probably noticed by now the flaps are
kind of just hanging here so we've
already set up the monitor here's your
29 inch diagonal size I guess the
monitor is not very thick so if you come
around on the side here you'll see that
it's it's really not thick at all I'd
say probably about 2 to 2 and a half
inches I will get the specs and I will
put those in the description below so if
you want to check out the specifics
about that feel free to hit those hit
those links up the resolution itself is
very very great I don't think in this
particular size you would need to go for
a 1440p display even when I sit you know
this close to the monitor
I don't see any individual pixels
whatsoever so unless I got really close
hey there yeah I can start seeing
individual pixels at this point but from
far away those pixels kind of just blend
together and that's how you know that
you have a solid resolution for your
monitor if you can't see pixels from
where you normally sit then the
resolution is pretty good so this is a
60 Hertz monitor so don't expect any
like extreme refresh rate or any of
those little micro movements in the
screen when you're watching a movie or
anything like that I do want to show you
that there are videos which can take
advantage of this ultra wide display so
basically what ultra wide is is if
you've ever seen a movie in widescreen
format you'll know that when you're
watching it in 1080p particularly there
are black bars on the top and bottom
well essentially what that is is this
format with the black bars on the top
and bottom only this screen cuts off the
top and bottom bars so that the only
thing you see is the actual moving
picture so that's pretty cool now if
you're watching a movie in 1080p the
pixels are going to be kind of faded and
washed out a bit when it comes to the
horizontal pixel resolution only because
the horizontal pixel count is 2560 in
this case and most 1080p movies only
have a horizontal pixel density of 1920
so if you're watching a 1080p movie and
it takes advantage of the ultra wide
display you won't actually be seeing a
full 25 60 pixels unless you're watching
a movie in that format so you can see
behind me a movie taking advantage of
the full 21 by 9 aspect ratio ultra wide
display now as I said before this pixel
count is not going to be a true 2560
pixels of like the resolution of the
monitor actually is it's only going to
be 1920 so there will be a bit of pixel
interpolation in the horizontal but in
the vertical because there are only ten
hundred and eighty pixels going up and
down the vertical pixel density will
remain true
so most modern games that you can pick
up on Steam will also support the ultra
wide format if you're kind of worried
about that compatibility issue games
like GTA 5 or one an ultra-wide no
problem they come with the option built
into the game practically there was
really no setup required the graphics
card automatically detected the ultra
wide format and then pretty much changed
all of my games to fit this resolution
at least the games that were compatible
other games also have this compatibility
built in games like left 4 dead 2 left 4
dead 2 seems to be able to run in this
resolution with no problems whatsoever
even though this game came out long
before any serious ultra wide monitors
were released to the market wow I am NOT
doing well right now so I would say that
most new games and about half of old
games that his games made before 2008
let's say will be able to take advantage
of the ultra wide display without having
to you know hyper stretch the screen and
make things look very odd I personally
love LG products I think the LG makes
some of the best screens on the market a
display resolution and the color
accuracy tend to follow suit afterwards
but the first thing that comes to mind
when people look at it display like this
I say wow you must have spent a lot of
money on that display really this
display didn't cost anywhere near as
much as you might think so with that
said I present to you the LG hmm yeah
let me check the box here I have a bunch
of weird names the LG 29 um 57 so if
you're going to look for this specific
monitor on Amazon or Newegg or really
anywhere else be sure to use that and of
code name for this specific monitor
model and you'll be sure to find it take
advantage of what I believe to be a very
very great display for what you're
paying LG makes great products they make
excellent screens and I am NOT
dissatisfied one bit so that's it this
is our first science studio review if
you'd like to see more reviews of
products let us know in the comments
below leave a like
he thought the video was just straight
crap leave a dislike and let us know we
can fix those issues that you had with
our videos
we'll be sure to bring more stuff to you
guys we appreciate the subscriptions and
we appreciate the support and the
feedback in the comments and as always
thanks for learning with us
