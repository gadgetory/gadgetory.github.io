at the arrow cool suite and I teased it
definitely clicked emitted a bit I'll
admit but I think you're gonna be really
impressed with what they booked for copy
text 2018 so we're about to walk into
the presidential suite here at the W
Hotel and Taipei Taiwan it's two stories
got a beautiful balcony wrapped around
the entire I don't even think calling it
a room does it justice let's just walk
all right so where to begin Eric who
manufactures furniture yeah set it
furniture you got chairs beanbags we'll
show you guys in a second they have a
few new cases that you probably haven't
seen yet that will hit the markets in
the u.s. particular very soon they've
got basically a full-on glam party going
on to my left in there there's another
room that you can't see yet we'll go in
there as well there's so much to see in
this place and they have their new
gaming desks you might be interested in
and then we'll hop up top and we'll
check out the dedicated streaming booths
so yeah this is the first flourish he's
pretty wide open Lisa's up top filming
from the balcony the view behind her by
the way is a priceless will end the
video showing you guys what that looks
like so let's start first with the
furniture now when I was a kid I was in
the beanbags this one admittedly is a
lot more comfortable than the one that I
had when I was like six or seven but it
brings back the good old days I remember
jamming PlayStation the original ps1 in
a beanbag that was much cheaper again
than this one cheaper in quality but not
necessarily cheaper in price this
actually only sells for about 55 bucks
it doesn't come with filling because
that's a shipping concern there are some
environmental concerns with what you
fill the bean bag with in certain
countries it's a mess so what you can do
is buy the bean bag shell which is what
I'm sitting on for 55 USD and then on
Amazon you could buy what a couple
hundred liters are so worth of bean bag
filling for like 17 bucks apiece
and there you go full-on bean bag and
it's shipped in a very small package
because again it's not filled when you
buy it so things can get as beefy as the
p7 CH - let me tell you I've been
contemplating replacing my couches in
our living room with these things what
do you think babe I think this would fit
I did a lot of space here eight room for
two oh and by the way if you're into
self raising desk dual motors and these
here from arrow you also get these
included pads that are actually fitted
perfectly to the soft rating so your
controls over on the right here and if
you want to go back down no problem
these motors can handle it up to 50 or
so kilos
yeah I'm pretty like don't judge me now
these are all of the arrow cool air
coolers I'm sure you've seen quite a
number of them on sites like Amazon
they're starting to work their way into
new egg as well we're gonna go through
every single one of them kind of like a
flash showcase here so this is the Avera
co 5 you got five heat pipes TDP of 150
the verrico to slam check out how tiny
and thin this thing is this is
ridiculously thin I want a health effect
it is 105 watt TDP pretty good for its
size there Vercoe 1 3 P more of a
stand-up small cooler fair Co for dark
with this nice dark aluminum fins there
and blacked out heat pipes and then we
have the Verico plus a top-down cooler
this reminds me of seeing other coolers
like this one but I like what they've
done here with the blue fan on top it's
just night it's a good combo Verico for
this one is like the vertical Ford dark
but it's just a little more shiny not as
matte the verrico a same thing as a
Virgo plus just a little smaller form
factor TDP a 100 you have the verrico
for light understand up cooler here
smaller and form factor but still 125
watt EVP Vercoe what is this a - 3 P
basically the same thing is this one but
what we're talking about here sockets
support and just a few minor changes
with the actual cooler itself and then
we have the verrico I I'm assuming
that's an eye Intel compatible so these
are good for LGA 1150 and the work so
again L GA and then a.m. 4 a.m. 3 plus
it works there we have the I'm gonna
call this the bass OGG the BAS AUG it's
kind of like a bowl-shaped air cooler
but I bet you it's pretty effective at
funneling air down to the CPU and the
socket itself the Verico 2 dual 120 watt
TDP more of a stand-up cooler with two
fans one on each side the BAS you PWM of
course self-explanatory name there for
pin feed item controller and that bowl
shaped funnel design we have the BAS u
3p again keep in mind we have universal
compatibility with these 110 watt TDP
it's just minor revisions and then the
original bas 100 watt TDP this is good
for Intel CPUs down below our last ones
the Verico 210 watt TDP 9 centimeter PWM
fan
and pretty snazzy for the size and then
the Verico qu+ just a slightly bigger
fan tacked on to a slightly wider
heatsink and there you go folks we just
reviewed not reviewed but we showcased
about 20 or so CPU coolers now this is
the work station assembly slash land
party zone where originally I assumed
the dining room would be era cool has
decided to turn it into a pretty sweet
gaming PC lounge we have six PCs here
I'm not gonna bother going through all
the specs to review the cases themselves
and talk about some of the features in a
separate part of this video but I really
like what they've done here they've
given this more personal gaming feel
right for anybody who comes in here
expecting to be treated like royalty
maybe a gaming royalty instead by the
way all these chairs
Thunder x3 chairs here really
comfortable not gonna lie sinking into
this one feels really nice now if you
remember our 2017 convict ex coverage we
had a booth kind of integrated with aro
coolest thing they had set up at nine
gang exhibition hall we actually had our
own little editing studio there at the
booth it was really nice they really
hooked us up and we create Leah preciate
it in the long run it was nice to have a
full-on desktop with which to edit this
is kind of like that vision seen in the
real world right if you had everything
basically arrow cooled out so if you had
an arrow cool gaming mouse gaming
keyboard you had the you know extra
arrow cool Thunder x3 peripherals you
had the courts Pro from arrow pool you
have all the different you know you have
a iOS in here the fans in here the power
supplies in here arrow pool makes a ton
of products and it didn't Lee they
haven't like you know penetrated much of
the American market yet and that's what
they are trying to do they're working on
getting these products to the masses in
the States because I think there's a lot
of potential there so what I want to do
at this point is kind of just show you
these two cases here in particular this
is a quartz pro this is a dual tempered
glass case here you see it's actually a
tempered glass door that swings open for
fans of five and a quarter inch drive
base you got like a CD optical drive or
sort you can put it right here so you're
not missing out this actually supports
fans up front up to three of those one
twenties I believe and then we can also
put one 20s against the right side panel
next to the motherboard we have adequate
ventilation here on the right side
panel for that intake or exhaust and
then also a 120 or 140 mm fan at the
back and it's a full tower so you get
eight PCI slots vertical graphics cards
support a full-on basement with sort of
modularity there if you want to build a
custom loop inside a case like this
perfect for it so I was gonna end by
showing you guys some of their new fans
I really like the borderless design here
so it's very cohesive clear you don't
see any of the LEDs kind of sticking out
so the diffuser is working very well
with these but then I got distracted
immediately not by something tech
related but I want to show you guys the
bathroom this is the Presidential Suite
after all not too many people get to
spend time in these so for some reason
you've got a fireplace it's just
chilling next to a huge bathtub and it's
where there's like a hollow point here
in between the actual ceramic of the
bathtub and what's likely granite or
marble which is really expensive
we have his-and-her sinks and a bunch of
empty space because why not
is this where you oh yeah this is where
you do your business
dedicated glass door just for that we're
gonna pan over here to the shower which
I'm not gonna lie I'm a little
intimidated by because I don't know what
any of these buttons do oh no it shows
you it's got a little graphic so if you
want one it'll it'll only I guess drop
water from the outsides if you're into
that sort of thing and then if you hit
two it'll only drop it from the very
middle and then you got one of these
you're singing to these right it's like
a microphone and this work of art right
here for some reason right across from
the shower which is completely
see-through it that's fine we have I'm
pretty sure a carbon fiber bike I'm
pretty sure this is almost entirely
carbon fiber and if it's not carbon
fiber it's a great imitation I've been
around cars that have carbon fiber on it
and it feels pretty dang good and wow I
just I just I just screw it let's just
let's just go let's see here oh yeah I
feel it
McLovin would love this and after a long
day of biking on a carbon-fiber frame
you've got a sauna and that's got to be
the coolest thing in this presidential
suite okay I spoke too soon not the
coolest thing but almost the coolest
thing panning around here see your bed
is just basically in the same room as
your bathroom I guess that's what rich
people are okay with you have a
streaming PC okay this is all air oh
cool I'll admit but it looks pretty dope
where they've got it set up on this sort
of improv stage if you will so you can
be live-streaming and looking out over
Taipei City at the same time and the
last thing the one I want to end with is
the view so this is the balcony
otherwise wasted space but absolutely
not in this circumstance because the
view is so good this ladies and
gentlemen is downtown Taipei from the
29th floor of the W Hotel have a look at
Taipei 101 it was the tallest building
in the world by the way until I believe
2010 or 11 when Burj Kalifa was built
which is admittedly much taller but this
thing was the record holder for about
five or so years so with that we're
gonna call this one quits I will be back
here again to review specifically the
courts RGB case which i think is going
to be a heck of a value stay tuned for
that
this is science studio thanks for
traveling with us
