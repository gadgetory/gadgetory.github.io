another I read a ridiculous Craigslist
video and this one is a pretty bad not
only is it extremely overpriced this
person is asking an obscene amount of
money for this PC but also it is
misleading in more than one area so
we're gonna dissect this I'm going to
show you guys how to I can kind of sift
through the BS right there's a lot of
that especially on Craigslist so let's
get started we'll look at why it's
overpriced and then talk about some of
the things that I know straight up are
not true alright so this is the end I'll
apologize it's pretty messy behind me
I've actually filmed this exact video
four times and each time I've had
something else go wrong so first the mic
wasn't working or it was kind of picking
up in and out second the screen wasn't
recording and the third time the mic was
messed up again so I'm hoping fourth
time's the charm
also if you guys want some Pepsi action
kitten sleeping right over there she's
not really kidding anymore she's growing
super fast anyway let's start with the
title these are always pretty fantastic
in all caps as usual fully built video
editing PC plus 24 inch curved 4k screen
I have my doubts about this we'll talk
about it later and a gaming mouse and
Kay which I assume is keyboard for a
grand total of twenty seven hundred and
fifty US dollars so this is the system
it looks like a cyber PowerPC pre-built
I mean it's branded as such so I would
assume that it is but he says that he
built it himself less than four months
ago I mean you may have built it online
dude but you didn't actually assemble
anything that was a pre-built and it's
called that for a reason
so we have this system and I can't
really tell you what all is you know
comprising the system because he didn't
include any system specs
that's your first huge red flag someone
asked this much money you put your
system specs in the description to
justify your asking price it's not down
here so we're gonna be left to our own
devices and this one is quote unquote
convenient snapshot here of his system
specs which only include his install to
ram 32 gigs which is more than those
people need in an i7 8700 k can't take
that away from them best gaming cpu out
there especially when overclocked
but you know this puts just a small dent
into his total asking price here now I
actually asked you guys what this was on
Twitter because I had no idea and again
we have no information about the
graphics card included so this is either
a gtx 1070 or a 1080 gigabyte mini card
and what gives it away is this unique
little like wide it's just this small
little party that has a back plate but
that gives it away as a gigabyte card
and it's only an 8 pin VGA power port
here so this is either a 1070 or 1080
not a 1080i because that will have a
minimum 8 plus 6 pin power config so I'm
just gonna give them the benefit of the
doubt here you're gonna get that quite a
bit in this video and assume it's a 1080
because we really don't know any better
you know this is his job and he didn't
do it for us so we have to just guess
and I'm not gonna dock him for it I'm
gonna be the nice guy here and assume
it's the 520 ish dollar gigabyte mini gt
X 1080 something else that has me just
questioning life is this right here this
sentence this thing cost me over $3,200
all included and I know how much of a
cut I'm taking but I need the money more
than a paperweight at this time like
dude come on like this is just this is
such crap here I can't believe he even
wrote that sentence and this this right
here this price tag I'm calling BS on it
I did tons of research into cyber
PowerPC pre builds I couldn't find
anything priced remotely close to $3,000
with the config that he has in here
based on what we know they don't even
sell a $3,200 system with a gtx 1080
like this one in it it just doesn't
happen I don't know where he's getting
these figures if he's just blatantly
lying but the system has is did not cost
him $3,200 I'll you know I'm as
confident as that as I am with anything
else so we have a similar system here
that I found this is as close as I could
find it is and it's 1979 bucks so that
tells you about the bat how far off he
is this comes with a you know i7 8700 K
it comes with an AC prime z 370 comes
with 16 gigs of ram you can add 16 more
for about 200 bucks no problem it makes
it $2,200 and then a gtx 1080 here the
the other thing is this 960 gig 82 SSD
like I don't see this in his build let's
assume you have a 4 terabyte hard drive
that's fine but a 960 gig SSD I don't I
don't see that in this build here like
he would have right I mean it would be
in the picture it sits or you can see it
barely but it sits right there on the
far left SSD tray and that's not
existent on this this picture is
non-existent this build overall it's not
sitting up front it's not sitting in the
middle tray did he move it from this
trade to behind the motherboard like
what did he put it if he had won in the
first place now I didn't notice this
originally but there's an Intel obtained
drive here so maybe he's just running an
octane hard drive config in which case
that means that this system is actually
cheaper than what I've got aspect for
here so I mean that's really all we can
infer from his Craigslist post here I
don't know why he even included this
picture like dude nice Adobe suite like
does that come with the pill door this
is subscription-based as far as I know
so you can't even you know you can't
even include this stuff because you have
to sign into your account so yeah
whatever I mean 2750 OBO first-come
first-serve okay buddy let me go ahead
and build a system that's better than
yours for cheaper than what you're
asking for it so we have a PC part
picker part list and I've pretty much
kept all the specs that I could identify
the same I've even included some better
parts than his just to show you how big
a ripoff this asking price actually is
the first up we have the i7 8700 K for
about 250 bucks on Amazon we have a 120
ml AO from coolermaster and that again
falls in line with what he's got here
this is some ASA tech looking pump from
I guess it's like a cyber power brand
but whatever we've had a better one in
our system I assume MSI Z 370 a for
about a hundred ten bucks solid
overclocking motherboard g.skill floor x
32 gig kit this comes in 4 8 p egg
modules and that's similar to what he's
got here although his don't have heat
sinks it's not gonna really affect the
performance of the the modules it just
more or less comes down to like right
the price overall the build quality I'd
say these modules are better than the
ones he's got in his system 300 bucks
that's not too bad considering how
expensive ram used to be it's starting
to come down a little
I included Samsung 970 Evo this is
better than the drive that he supposedly
has in a system but even if we knock
this out and just throw an op tain drive
right it gets even worse but if we
replace this with a 968 data drive like
the one we just saw and obtain this is
still gonna cost more than they config
dit that he has so four terabytes of
Western Digital blue goodness 100 bucks
GeForce GTX 1080 from gigabyte this is
the mini card for about 520 ish US
dollars on Newegg you can ignore the
rebate it doesn't really affect the end
result here NZXT s340 elite same as the
case depicted in this picture here we
have an EVGA 600 watt 80 plus bronze PSU
for about 40 bucks an outlet PC and I'm
willing to bet this power supply is
better than the one he's got in his
system I mean look at these ugly blue
connector points right on this power
supply I think this is an afterthought
and most pre builds from companies like
this are gonna really cheap out on the
power of supply is in the lower end
stuff so just keep a look out right it's
hard to tell and that's why they do this
with power supplies because you're not
gonna know what brand it is unless you
actually tear open the PC which you
can't do until you buy the system so
yeah this is a place where many
pre-built swil compromise and it's just
up to you to do your due diligence and
figure out what exactly is under the
basement we have a Windows 10 home I
included for just 20 bucks because you
can get these on like kinguin you get
them on LCD keys for way cheaper than
the you know 100 or so US dollars that
Microsoft's gonna charge you so these
are usually just om keys and they'll be
good for a build and that's what I use
for all of my builds now we have a
Samsung 4k 60 Hertz monitor and I'll
talk about this for a second because 340
bucks here right for this but this
monitor is not the same monitor as the
one he's showing in the picture
so let's assume he's selling this one I
would assume that's the case because
he's got the picture of it in his add
this Samsung monitor doesn't come in a
4k config let alone a 24-inch size and
curved at that Samsung as far as I know
doesn't even make a 24-inch 4k monitor
the PPI would be too high that Aaron
Skeen 24 and 27 is pretty much
negligible at this resolution and that's
why they stick to a higher diagonal size
so I did my best to search on Google to
find something that was
I don't know as close to what he's
saying he has as possible and this is it
I mean this is basically his monitor
it's got the same curved base it's got
the curved panel and this one if we
scroll down to the system specs is a
1920 by 1080 panel so it's a 1080p panel
I'm not even sure what the refresh rate
is and they're not showing it on here as
far as I know so it's probably 60 Hertz
if it was anything higher than that I'm
sure they would advertise it up top
that's what retailers do they don't want
to be misleading and that's kind of how
they make sales sometimes right so this
is 180 bucks this is half the price of
the one we've got a bucket here but I'm
gonna give him the benefit of the doubt
again just because I don't know I mean
he for all I know he's he's lying here
okay that's what I think he's doing
because I haven't found this panel
unless he got it from some weird person
who replaced the panel's and somehow
made this one curve in the 4k resolution
and this diagonal sighs it doesn't exist
and he's trying to con whoever's buying
this and I mean unless you get really
close to the display you're not gonna
know it's not 4k anyway so yeah I think
he's trying to gyp you and then I got a
Corsair k55 wired gaming keyboard for
about 50 bucks and a Logitech g600 2
wireless optical mouse these aren't you
know the best for gaming but they're
better more than likely than what he's
got here these are just like generic
CyberPower PC branded peripherals this
is the cheaper gaming mouse and this I'm
pretty sure isn't even a mechanical
keyboard so there we've done our due
diligence thoroughly and our grand total
is just under $2,200 which is a thousand
dollars less than what he's saying he
paid for this system four months ago and
is still 500 and you know some change
dollars less than what he wants to sell
it for and now so yeah I'm calling BS on
this one I think he's just trying to
pull somebody's leg and take more money
for the system than he actually paid for
it up front let me know what you guys
think in the comments below so that's a
wrap for this one I hope you guys don't
think I was being too harsh on this
person again I've tried to keep things
as anonymous as possible if you do
happen to find the ad do not harass this
person that is not the point of the
video again it is to inform you guys of
the garbage out there how to properly
sift through it if you still want to
entertain this person then you could you
know send a full-on pc port picker list
and say hey i could pull this exact
system for
a lot less would you be willing to take
is slightly lower than retail for your
build and if that person says no move on
there are plenty of other options out
there I doubt this person will sell this
build for this much although I have
overestimated human capacities in the
past and I'm sure somebody who has no
idea what he or she is doing might see
this and say oh looks really cool
might be worth twenty seven fifty that's
a ridiculous price anyway let me know
what you guys think in the comments
below I hope this video was at least
entertaining but I do want to stress
again the informative sections of these
videos you guys can learn from this
stuff especially if you want to jump
into the use market and I see
what's a good deal what's a bad deal we
tend to emphasize the bad deals because
there are a lot of them out there and
you guys tend to like those but we do
have a few I read videos out there with
good as included so you get an idea of
what you know use parts are worth that's
the hardest thing I think to do in the
use market is to put a price tag on
something that is not new
so again thumbs up if you like the video
this lega to feel the complete opposite

haven't already good sponsors you want
to get fancy with it and catch you in
