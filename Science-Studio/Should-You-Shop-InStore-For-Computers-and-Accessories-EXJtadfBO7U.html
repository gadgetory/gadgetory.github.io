today is take a tour fuelled trip if you
will outside of the studio we're going
to price some pre-built pcs from Best
Buy and see if we can match or beat some
of their prices if we decided to build
them on our own let's go and take a tour
inside and see what we can find
so the two that I really want to hit in
this video are the ones that are more
gaming oriented so there are plenty of
actual like just plain old desktop PCs
that'll be good for anybody who's just
looking to do some light business but
the two in particular the desk that this
Best Buy are selling that you would want
to purchase particularly for gaming are
one this one and then the other one is
that I buy power PC that looks very
immaculate over there that nice
beautiful white one that will hit up
after this so this one actually believe
it or not is the more expensive of the
two and you'll see why here in a second
so first off we're looking at an Intel
Core i5 6400 eight gigabytes of ddr4 a
one terabyte hard drive and a GTX 970 4
gigabyte graphics card also Windows 10
operating system and for the operating
systems what we'll do is include the
price that we could purchase an
operating system for from kinguin for
about 20 to 25 dollars so we'll include
that in our price of these builds but
for now this is all we know so we aren't
given the power supply wattage or the
manufacturer that's going to pose a
problem I'm also kind of concerned about
that why they wouldn't want to tell us
what kind of power supplies they have in
here
but apart from that what we can
definitely do is a price out this I 5
6400 these eight gigabytes of ddr4 we're
going to assume that they're using
pretty cheap ddr4 so nothing at 3,000
megahertz or anything close to that
we're going to say in 2400 maybe would
be a fair safe estimate for the speed of
the RAM they've used in there a one
terabyte hard drive so they're not using
a solid-state drive that's still
disappointing to see in a gaming
computer especially from somebody who
would expect their computer to put it
very quick you're not going to have that
with this particular build here and then
of course the GTX 970 for video so we're
looking at a price tag of 1,050 bucks
and I have a feeling that we can beat
that price by a pretty substantial
margin just from what I've seen so far
on this build if you take a look at the
PC itself
I mean it's nice-looking it does have
little subtle LEDs it's hard to see in
this this ambient light but there are
red LEDs on both sides you do have
plenty of front IO ports we will pry
something out and we'll see if we can
beat it I have a good feeling we will be
able to
so let's move on to the one we can
actually see inside this one is a much
more pretty in my opinion and we're
looking at a prebuilt PC from iBUYPOWER
you can find these on Amazon Newegg I
buy power does build plenty of pcs and
sells them roughly it cost I've been
surprised by the the bargains you can
pick up from an I buy Power PC and from
the company so you can see this one's
plenty lit we have nice subtle LEDs on
the bottom here to illuminate the inside
of the case we do have blue LED fans in
both the front and the back and if your
Hardware savvy you'll notice that that
graphics card right there is an NVIDIA
GTX 960 from MSI if you take a look at
the specifications for this PC here
we're looking at a core i5 6402 P now
I'm not certain what that is we'll just
assume for all intents and purposes
that's a 6400 the o2p is probably a
special variant of the processor may be
a little less power consuming but for
the most part n i5 6400 so we're looking
at 4 cores 4 threads at around a 3
gigahertz operating frequency now the
memory here 8 gigabytes of ddr4 we're
also looking at a one terabyte hard disk
drive and a 120 gigabyte SSD so it's
nice to see that a gaming PC of this
caliber has included a solid-state drive
and if you're taking it serious in the
fact that that PC over there which cost
about 200 bucks more did not include one
that's a bit disappointing for the asu's
PC ibuypower doing pretty well so far
let's keep looking we have of course the
NVIDIA GTX 960 4 gigabyte graphics card
some 4 gigs of video memory and an msi
branded card now we're not looking at a
backplate here that's a bit
disappointing but I mean for what you're
paying for this PC it does appear to be
a much better bargain we can see that
this power supply right here is a 500
watts so maximum 500 watt output from
the power supply I can't tell what
specifically it is it might be an
antique power supply but it's certainly
not one of those run-of-the-mill ones
you can purchase for like 20 bucks on
Amazon so that's nice to see there the
motherboard is an asus motherboard now I
know specifically what these run for
currently we're looking at about $100
for this motherboard and we are using
the stock Intel cooler I don't expect
any of these to not use a socket Intel
cooler no problem there will be a bit
louder but you're saving quite a bit of
money on that as well so if you want to
upgrade that certainly upgradable not a
problem we
also looking at an a data 8 gigabyte RAM
module no dual channel memory involved
here but it would be very simple to
update or upgrade your RAM from a single
making stick to to a gig sticks run
those and dual Channel no big deal at
all and for those of you who are
interested yes you have I get this thing
open included a DVD Drive for those of
you old school Goonies who want to pop
in those classic rollercoaster tycoon
and sid meier sim golf games from back
in the day no problem whatsoever running
this thing with the included CD optical
drive
yeah I just can't believe or they don't
have the other ones out here this yeah
yeah we're doing good man we're like
basically we're pricing out y'all's pcs
and seeing what we have a YouTube
channel you know we're seeing like like
what the premiums are for people to see
versus ones that we do it so okay so
like honestly like Divac Halloweeny out
there it's bad the way you can build it
for good parts you're looking at it like
a $50 Delta bad yeah yeah but in your
agency you're paying a lot of money for
stuff exactly yeah the only thing is a
lot of those don't have power supplies
listed anywhere on the bills like it or
tags every gig information okay I
think's a memory instead of rampant
recovers it well combine something we're
gonna call like a YouTube channel honor
and check out I need to get that man
even people ask me about that oh my god
it's just called science video science
students inside yeah I'll check out cool
prints it up they free cool man
we miss one PC it's over here in the
back corner next to all of the video
card and computer peripheral Isles with
this particular PC here I don't know
exactly let's say this has the i-5 in it
now what we're looking at spec wise as
an i5 4460 we can pick these up for
about 180 bucks again that's not a very
hefty pricetag memory modules here 8
gigabytes of ddr3 this is a hassle
process that we're looking at ddr3
definitely but I am not aware of whether
or not this is running a dual channel or
if this is a single dim single 8 gig
stick of RAM also a bit disappointing
for how nice this PC looks on the
outside only a 1 terabyte hard drive no
solid state drive included that you can
kind of gauge for yourself what you
think about that but of course we are
looking at substantially longer boot
times with only a one terabyte hard
drive included we also have an NVIDIA
GTX 750 this is not a 750 Ti roughly
$100 part only two gigs of VRAM you're
not gonna need any more than that
because the card definitely won't be
able to handle any more of that another
fact about this computer that is a bit
disappointing is that we don't have any
clear indication of what power supply is
being used now this is a what appears to
be ITX form factor so more than likely
an ITX motherboard inside as well as
more than likely a power supply that is
in the sfx form factor this entire
chassis does not look to be wide enough
for a regular ATX power supply so more
than likely an SFX power supply which
will run a bit more and will cost you a
bit more compared to the regular ATX
versions and the price tag ultimately of
$900 so I can just tell you straight up
from experience there's no way this
computers worth 900 bucks
and the final aisle in our tour of Best
Buy and their lovely products they're
offering currently we have the graphics
cards and the peripherals so first off
let's run through the stuff that I know
you guys are interested in that's a
graphics card prices looking at three
hundred and seventy nine dollars for a
reference design GTX 970
no thank you five hundred and fifty
dollars for gtx 980 again we're looking
at a hundred dollar premium to purchase
this thing right now versus online for
about four hundred and fifty ish dollars
now a price that actually is competitive
that I am surprised about is their GTX
970 EVGA graphics card look at this
three hundred bucks for a super super
clock GTX 970 I've actually owned this
exact card I purchased one on Newegg
refurbished for 270 bucks you're looking
at a brand new one for $300 you can
probably purchase this brand new right
now for 300 bucks go ahead and pull up
the Newegg page yeah not too far off
this is actually a really good price
considering you can literally walk out
with this card today throw it in your PC
and start gaming on the same day versus
waiting for that two or three day
shipping for that package to arrive to
get something a to date model oh okay
yeah exactly
so next on the line is a gtx 960 2
gigabyte graphics card 220 bucks now
think so
you could pick these up for about 160
hundred $70 just off the top of my head
maybe 180 on Newegg 4 to gig gtx 960
i've owned one of these as well and
they're not where 220 bucks tell you
that right now
and of course on the bottom shelf I
wonder if they did that on purpose the
AMD graphics cards now these prices are
actually fairly competitive we're
looking at an AR nine 390x for 400 bucks
you could actually get this right now on
Newegg for about that price not too bad
of course a gigabytes of gddr5 this will
pretty much run anything you want in
1080p maxed out and even 1440p I would
recommend this specifically for 4k
gaming but certainly 2 of these in
crossfire wouldn't be a bad idea but
you're looking at 800 bucks for a pair
that's substantial to many the price it
does become a bit steep
when you start looking towards the
bottom of the a and D offerings
currently at best by 350 bucks for an r9
390 now I can get one for about 320
bucks on new I currently and so could
you to the right of that we have an r7
370 I have actually on the specific card
I didn't pay that price for it but not
too far off and when I paid about 150
bucks versus 170 a little bit of a
premium there and we start downgrading
even further to an r7 360 130 bucks I
I'll let you decide about that one
that's that's kind of like a 750ti
graphics card
not the greatest offered currently and
then finally our five to 20 $39.99 this
is probably the one that we saw in the
CP in the PC over there right I think
it's the exact same card they are a 5
Series r5 - 20 40 bucks I wouldn't even
buy a graphics card if I had to pay 40
bucks for it's just not going to do
anything unless you don't have any
grated graphics in which case I guess
you have no choice but to purchase a
cheap one I'm not gonna waste all time
running through a bunch of the stuff
they offer that isn't really PC related
in terms of what goes inside a PC we do
have plenty of things that would
certainly complement your gaming
experience but of course at generally
premium price tags I do think you could
get some of this for cheaper online but
of course you're paying a premium to get
this stuff in store today that you could
use today so it makes sense and that's
why they have businesses and that's why
they still make money because people
want things immediately and they don't
want to have to wait for them you do
something like a 240 millimeter
all-in-one water cooling unit from
Corsair H 100 I not too bad I haven't
owned one of these personally but plenty
of people online do you use them for
overclocking 120 bucks about a $20 Delta
not too bad if you want one right away
maybe we can take a field trip outside
of the studio today you guys fine with
the outside that's why I'm using one
phone because I believe that that
microphone is not doing too well let's
have a listen what you guys would hear
if we just use that microphone
yeah so we have a GoPro and we're gonna
face mountain to the base promise so we
have a GoPro and we're going to mount
this to the chest of mr. drew he is the
cameraman today so a hydra would turn
the camera to be shot all right so drew
is gonna be the cameraman you can have
two cameras on them and hopefully when
we get kicked out of the store but we
want to do today is price out some of
their pre-built pcs and see if we can do
better ourselves we decided to build
them on our own so we're essentially
finding out here if building your own PC
is actually worth it or not if you
wanted to purchase one pre-built from
Best Buy and you were deciding whether
or not it was worth your time and effort
to build one yourself so good yeah Jack
second shooting let's take four</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
