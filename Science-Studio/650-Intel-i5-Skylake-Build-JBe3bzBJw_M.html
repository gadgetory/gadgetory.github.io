studio and yes I have another PC bill to
show off to you guys it's sitting here
in the studio it's right behind me it
may look familiar because I'm featuring
the same NZXT s340 case as the previous
intel skylake i3 bill only this one is
in the glossy black color instead of the
glossy white color so yes it is a new PC
and it's actually featuring parts that
I've never used in a PC I've ever built
before so let's go ahead get right into
the specs for the first time in my
existence I've purchased an Intel Core
i5 yes and i-5 a true quad core I've
always gone with AI threes I always
thought that I 3s gave you the best bang
for the buck but we will see in another
video of which the link will be right
here when that video is uploaded going
to click that if it's there if it's not
I'm sorry we'll be there shortly
I threes usually are the best bang for
the buck but in maybe this case the i-5
is worth the extra fifty to sixty
dollars so what I thought did I go with
I went with an i-5 6400 no one did not
go for the i-5 6600 K because for the
simple reason that I didn't feel that
$100 premium justified just an unlocked
multiplier I know it's gonna overclock a
bit better than the 6400 wildung 6490
even designed to be overclocked although
it does
turbo boost quite well I just figured I
would you know overclock it using the
base clock method and save 100 bucks
that way you know invest that into like
a cooler or something which I actually
didn't do the stock cooler is doing just
fine and I am running that CPU currently
at this moment at 4 gigahertz stable
I've played games with it the CPU fan
does get a bit loud but I mean that's
what I get for not purchasing a CPU
cooler up front so I'll have to do that
very soon but it is running stable of 4
gigahertz on air with a stock cooler so
if you're curious about how these
processors overclock using the base
clock method yeah you get the 4
gigahertz most of the time very stable
that's all I'll really say about that
but ok so I overclock the CPU well how
did I do it what motherboard it is I
decided to use the exact same asrock
z170 proform on the board that I have
used in the past
so this asrock motherboard has a lot of
great features 5.1
round sound AMD crossfire I actually I
didn't go with an AMD graphics card for
once yeah that's surprising especially
you know me I usually go for the more
budget oriented AMD GPUs but in this
case I wanted to test out in vidiian I
figured I could make cool video or -
comparing the car that I have now in the
car that I had in the past so if you're
tech savvy you probably know which card
I'm talking about that's in there right
now not going to tell you yet but anyway
the motherboards great I painted it I
use the same painting process as before
so I use the white plastidip that I
purchased from Lowe's thank you Lowe's
for that expensive Plasti Dip and also
this time used a glossy plastic finish
so it made it look a little shinier than
usual that was cool I think I'm gonna
keep doing that I like the shiny appeal
especially with those NZXT LEDs in there
and it just it looks great in the case I
think a white black color schemes
awesome if you hate it get over it white
black school it's just cool
I also slapped in some PNY anarchie ddr4
yo at 2400 megahertz and dual channels
you know so yeah they're fancy looking
rims you know I mean dims they're fancy
looking dims and I got them for a pretty
cool price $40 on you a check that out
but okay enough of the fuss what
graphics card did I choose well I chose
a ZOTAC yeah is otech nvidia gtx 960 4
gigabyte graphics card and let me tell
you i am very impressed with how well
this card holds up in games at very
impressed I expected this card to
underperform compared to the r9 380 for
you my car that I had in my i3 build but
I don't know maybe it's because I'm
using an i5 as well I Five's do make a
difference but this card is doing very
well in fact it mirrors and sometimes
surpasses the r9 380 in gaming and I
will show you that in another future
video if that video is not here right
now it is coming very soon so stay tuned
for that but it's there go ahead and
click it but anyway on top of that I've
got a kingston SSD in there for a boot
drive just 120 gigabytes does quite well
boots up in like three seconds it's
see I love SSDs I will never not go with
an SSD ever again and also have a 322
bite caviar blue hard drive yeah that's
the same one that I've used for the past
like three or four or five years or
whatever when I bought from Best Buy
I always keep that in whenever I get rid
of my other computers I pull that hard
drive out because there's all my games
on it I don't feel like reloading all of
those games from Steam so it saves me a
lot of time and it's just a quick you
know inserting exort exort insert and
extract i don't know what word I'm
looking for there back to the paint job
for a sec I decided to paint the fans as
well for the first time ever I painted
all parts of the Intel fan you know the
stock fan it's included with the CPU and
it's holding up quite well I mean I even
the blades themselves were painted and
they turn I don't notice any like drag
or clicking noises going on inside of
there so I think the painting process
was okay I didn't put too many coats on
the fins themselves so they they they
still turn adequately I would say but as
for the NZXT fans they're in the front
where it looks like a radiator should be
I decided not to paint those blade that
just painted the frames and yeah the
paint job on those are a little rustic
they're not the most professional but
from the side they're mostly white and
provides a great contrast to that black
glossy finish around the outside of the
NZXT s340 case which I love by the way
it's a gray case has a huge window you
get to show off all the goodies inside
no ncx he's not painting for this little
insert but man I love their case so
that's about it everyone I don't want to
keep you for too long but I did want to
show you that yes I did purchase a new
computer and yes I am sporting that I
five you'd see that I five bucks is up
there yep it's up there and it's a great
PC I I think I'm an i-5 for life now I
don't think I'm to the point where I
need an i7 yet but an i-5 gets the job
done and yes there is a noteworthy
increase in performance from the i3 to
the i-5 how much of an increase
I don't know and does it justify the
price I can well if you're curious about
that go ahead and click on this link
here I already posted a once but if you
were you know cool enough to watch the
whole video you can't click on this link
now go ahead hop over that one
this is science duty everyone thanks for
