you're on red or green most of us can
agree that in video was a bit misleading
when it came to their advertised four
gigabytes of vram on their GTX 970 s for
those of you who aren't familiar with
this issue an NVIDIA standard for via
Ram supplies been about three gigabytes
up until the GTX 780 but with the
release of the 970 and the 980 an extra
V Ram chip has been added to the PCB to
communicate with a new maximum
architecture GPU to add an extra
gigabyte of VRAM so now we have four
gigs instead of three gigs and it's
advertised as such on both the GTX 970
and the GTX 980
but while the GTX 980 can access its
full 4 gigabytes of vram and it's full
bus frequency the GTX 970 has a bit of a
problem past 3.5 gigabytes
up to 3.5 gigabytes the GTX 970 behaves
identically to the GTX 980 but it's that
final point 5 gigabytes of vram that is
the GTX 970 s Achilles heel but why it's
because that final half a gig of VRAM is
actually severely under clocked in terms
of how fast it communicates with the GPU
this can pose a problem for gamers who I
don't like to throw a bunch of dense
texture packs into their games or turn
up distance scaling to the max setting
possible these kinds of additional
veeram requirements can pose mighty big
problems for the GTX 970 so what I've
got in this rig behind me is a gigabyte
windforce a GTX 970 g1 gaming Edition
graphics card we're going to throw a few
games at it but I expect in particular
GTA 5 to reveal some pretty obvious
results so we're going to be able to see
whether or not passing 3.5 gigabytes of
memory allocation poses a problem for
the GTX 970 and for you who are
utilizing the GTX 970 currently so let's
go ahead and investigate let's see what
we end up with I wanted to try a few
games other than GTA 5 first I honestly
didn't think cities skylines order
trolley would even utilize more than
about three gigabytes of vram and I was
right with every single setting in both
games completely maxed out we didn't
even pass 3.2 gigabytes of memory usage
we also never dipped it below 30 yet
PS an either game which was quite nice
so on to GTA 5 then my first step was to
turn settings up just enough to rub
against the 3.5 cake boundary this test
would be our control I draw a few blocks
through the city and then made my way
into the mountains where I expected the
grass being on ultra to drop our
framerate by a significant amount I was
averaging about 40 FPS in the city and
about 25 FPS in the grass which seemed
about right next I pushed the memory
usage just above 3.5 gigabytes and ran
through the same course but I didn't
notice any framerate dips apart from
journeying through the grass once again
now on my third run next I maxed out
every possible setting again no
noticeable frame drops or stuttering at
1080p the next trial consisted of
lowering a few advanced graphics
settings and pushing the frame scale up
to 5/4 essentially increasing our
in-game resolution by 25% this pushed us
a solid 200 megabytes above the 3.5 gig
threshold but no still nothing
our overall frame rate had definitely
been sliced but nothing out of the
ordinary ended up slashing our FPS until
rain that's right it began raining in
the game and then suddenly stuttering
here stuttering there it was fairly
consistent throughout and could
definitely become a nuisance of its
presence what's prolonged what's likely
going on here is that the rain is
requiring the graphics card to
completely remap texture units since the
transition is nowhere near as slow as
the fade from day to night the memory
bus is consistently being squeezed for
every ounce of data only the final half
gig of memory is taking much longer to
send data to the GPU now because it's
only 5% of the total memory bandwidth
being restrained the stuttering isn't
prolonged but when it strikes it strikes
it with a vengeance a solid couple
seconds of gameplay is completely lost
in the process which could be disastrous
especially in first-person shooters or
RPGs so I guess we should summarize it
like this if you plan on playing in
1080p only with your GTX 970 to the
point where you can max out pretty much
any setting that you wish you're gonna
be just fine in almost any circumstance
1440p is a slightly different story only
slightly and here's why
while yes you will be using more memory
in 1440p because you're going to be
meeting too
store larger chunks of data because
you're gonna be pushing more pixels to a
screen you will have to cut back on some
things such as anti-aliasing ambient
occlusion maybe some of the things you
ought to scale back in order to keep
those appropriate frame rates around 30
to 60 fps and most triple-a titles so in
a sense you'll be adding some memory
requirements but you'll be subtracting
some as well by cutting back on those
additional settings 2160p
totally different beast but I don't
recommend purchasing at GTX 970 for the
purpose of playing triple-a titles in 4k
and I don't have a 4k monitor so we're
not going to be able to test that truly
anyway but think about it you're gonna
be increasing your pixel density right
playing at 4k but you're going to have
to cut back on things like texture packs
and rendering distances and
anti-aliasing all of that you'll be able
to notice much more when playing in 4k
so it kind of counteracts itself it's
kind of oxymoronic actually so I
wouldn't purchase this for 4k gaming you
might be okay with it but I'm not and
that's why I'm not going to test them in
this video test that resolution but in
1080p and 1440p this card handles quite
a bit of memory usage very well even
when it passes 3.5 gigabytes the card is
fairly smart it knows what memory data
needs to be sent to the GPU right away
and what can wait and the stuff that can
wait is typically allocated and thats
lower half a gig portion of memory and
that's that that's why the GTX 970
doesn't suffer as much as it appears to
suffer and all of these tech vlogs and
websites that say that this is such a
big issue
so with that you all know the routine
let me know what you think about the GTX
970 and whether or not you should
consider it over the r9 390 which is
generally a better performer in most
games and does come with twice as much
veer and that's right a gigabytes of
vram versus four or three and a half and
0.5 with slow vram depending on how you
look at it if you own a GTX 970 let me
know in the comments below and tell me
what you personally think about your car
and very interested to hear what you
have to say be sure to give the video a
thumbs up if you thought the video was
great and give it a thumbs down if you
think that we need to improve somewhere
apart from that be sure to subscribe if
you haven't already we'll be posting
some pretty cool benchmarks and regards
to our pentium g 4400
if gtx970 pairing how well with a pretty
cheap cpu do with a very powerful GPU
find out in our next video
