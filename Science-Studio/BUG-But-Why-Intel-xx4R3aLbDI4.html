a computer with hardware manufacturer at
any time during the last two decades or
so then this video probably pertains to
you in at least some sense now I want to
start off by saying that my job here is
not to instill fear while your kernel
memory may be at risk to thousands of
hackers vendors Intel arm AMD and others
are all ready to roll out patches for
these issues but some of these come at
costs in this minute science episode
we'll discuss those costs and why on an
architectural level we even have to pay
in the first place
Google anything with the words security
or bug in it and you'll likely be
inundated with reporting sites some that
have absolutely nothing to do with
technology attempting to describe the
security threat to modern processors
let's start with the basics first the
first thing you need to know is that
every modern CPU needs a modern
operating system Windows Linux Mac OS
doesn't really matter but it needs
something by which to communicate with
and manage onboard Hardware all of these
operating systems rely on something
called a virtual memory it's a way for
systems to preserve RAM in favor of
other storage drives let's say hard disk
drives in this case this is often
referred to as page filing when your
computer dumps temporary data into
literal files on your storage drives in
place of system ram now in turn a
virtual address space requires a sort of
mapping process in comes the page table
think of it like a translator every
program in your operating system has a
unique virtual address corresponding to
a physical address when your CPU calls a
physical address it uses the page table
or more specifically the translation
lookaside buffer that's basically
dedicated CPU cache to locate and draw
the file now without getting into rings
and kernel specifics what you need to
know is that a certain degree of
speculation ensues when a CPU executes
the task and stores it to memory for
example it may anticipate a certain
mathematical function tied to a physical
address based on environmental cues and
store the answer before the problem is
even drawn this in turn speeds up
processes and only requires a simple
deletion if the prediction leads to no
real address but the drawback now
exposed to the public involves this
speculative execution when the CPU seeks
to predict it temporarily stores
metadata in the TLB in cache which is
relatively unprotected and vulnerable in
fact it's been exploited by various
research groups and brought to the
attention of namely Intel whose
architecture specifically prioritizes
speculative execution
the reason AMD claims to be free of
these chains resides in the fact that
their CPUs do not engage in page table
speculation therefore no sensitive data
is stored in cache while it searches for
addresses anything from password
fragments to full program and
application control could be seized from
this information and that's why it's so
important here simply put programs
aren't supposed to have this kind of
access to other programs and thus users
aren't supposed to have this kind of
access to those programs but where do
the expected performance hits come into
play then well since this is an issue
with the protocols of the architecture a
simple micro code push won't remedy
anything instead the bug requires a
direct manipulation of the software
because this is like something baked
into the CPU for example Linux systems
are now pushing an acronym dubbed Keizer
which essentially splits kernel and user
spaces to eliminate leakage until plans
to do the same thing in the coming days
but it comes at a price now regarding
performance degradation and reports of
30% slower Intel computers these are
extremely workload sensitive and likely
won't affect the average user a few
users testing the latest coffee like CPS
for example have reported substantial
cuts and some very heavy CPU synthetic
benchmarks but virtually no losses
regarding gaming and content creation
which is what I personally care about
not sure how it's possible and I remain
neutral in this matter in particular I'm
not just I'm not filled in enough with
the details to speculate but one thing's
for sure many millions of systems are
caught in the crossfire here I've linked
a few articles pertinent to this topic

up I appreciate it thumbs down for the
opposite glue subscribe but if you
