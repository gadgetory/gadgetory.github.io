office for this video because I want to
benchmark very unorthodox graphics card
I'm calling it over the rocks because
it's not one you would typically go out
and buy for the purpose of gaming this
is more or less in graphic store you
would use if your see if you didn't have
integrated graphics so maybe a Rison
processor you would have turned
something into a HTPC you would need a
graphics card like this one now which
one am I talking about I'm gonna go into
the film room for a second I actually
purchased this a while back and I've
been meaning to test it because I really
want to know just how powerful an r5 220
graphics card really is
to be quiet dark bass 700 brings luxury
and silence to the mainstream luxury
thanks to subtle RGB integration full
case modularity and even USB type-c
support in silence thanks to 3 included
silent wings 3 fans and sound dampening
foam all around click the link in this
video's description for more details so
there are a few things that make this
small little card unique first off its
size of course it's a 1 slot card
because it is severely underpowered when
you compare it to something like I don't
know an R 9 390 or the more recent
graphics cards like the rx 480 the 580
and something like a gtx 1070 on nvidia
side so not only that it's also
passively cool this is just a heatsink
on top here with no fan integrated it's
that low-power it doesn't need dedicated
PCIe power it doesn't need anything
except what you see here it's just plug
and play apart from the software you to
install so what we're gonna do is pop
this into that machine right there so
this is a rendition of walter white if
you will in there right now as a gtx
1080 TI one of the best graphics cards
you can currently buy on the market
especially for the money well maybe not
today's money in the days market but you
know back when prices were actually
reasonable i allready benchmarked eight
games with this card and now we're gonna
put this little thing in there and see
just what it can do a quick lan to the
specs here i had to refresh my memory
because it was a wild back when i
purchased this thing a tea stream
processors built-in okay it's not as bad
as the seven in this video maybe over on
this side of the screen from way back in
the day but this is not like i said a
very powerful card 64-bit memory
interface a core clock of 650 megahertz
that's compared to the 1080 TI which is
the ultimate powerhouse if you will
3584 cuda cores they're not a one-to-one
spring processes and cuda cores are are
different all around that you can kind
of get an idea for how much more
advanced this card is also a boost clock
of 1582 thats 1.5 1.6 gigahertz so huge
difference this is not going to be a
fair comparison that's not the point of
this video i just want to show you how
viable this actually is in today's
market if you're thinking about buying
something that's super cheap because
everything else out there is extremely
expensive right now yes
even starting to work into the 1050 TI
territory the RX 560 this thing might be
something you're considering we're gonna
find out this video if it actually is
something you should consider for gaming
so let's pop it in let's install the
software and see what kind of frames we
get in today's modern games that's the
first things first we do want to
uninstall the previous video driver it
just eliminates the hassle it might show
up in the future especially we put the
AMD card in there although in today's
day and age it's pretty simple to do so
we're gonna uninstall this so we're
gonna power off the PC pull out the
1080i and then pop this bad boy and
we're actually getting a few PCIe cables
power cables just kind of laying around
the case it'll look really weird also
this part is so small I don't even think
people are going to think this is a
graphics card they'll probably suspect
it's something like a sound card that's
what yeah that's what today's sound
cards look like it's about the same form
factor here now it's funny I think it
takes longer for the Nvidia drivers to
uninstall than it does for them to
install oh okay this is not where the
screw driver belongs doesn't belong in
the kitchen okay we're just gonna leave
those there this is a 1080i from
gigabyte for those wondering find it
link in the video description although I
don't recommend you buy something like
this now because it's gonna cost upwards
of $1,000 which is a bit ridiculous
that's a pretty sweet though it doesn't
come with a backplate probably only
aesthetic thing I would add to the card
especially for the money but it's
alright
here we go wow this is this is so small
I'm not even gonna I'm not even gonna
secure this thing to the to the chassis
I'm just gonna leave it hanging like
that it's just so light and in tiny
alright and we're gonna power it back on
I'll leave the glass off so what I have
in here right now actually I forgot to
say this earlier this is arisin 7 1700 X
so rice and CPUs don't have integrated
GPUs which means that you will need
something like this if you want to run
an HTPC or even game I think this is
probably the bare-bones graphics card
for gaming but you will need this if you
want to connect your PC to a monitor and
actually see something on screen so just
because the motherboard has you know
like HDMI out or DisplayPort out those
connections are out
before the becoming AMD APU snot for
Rison CPUs alright our screen is ultra
low resolution that's not a problem
let's go to AMD auto detect ok so it
looks like the max resolution we can run
with this card via HDMI is 1080p so I've
tried changing it here the highest we
can go is 1080p 1920 by 1080 and then
also if I go into the catalyst control
center which you know this is old-school
and we're back to the catalyst Center
this will also only allow us to go up to
1080p
so we're basically yeah we're there's
nothing really we can do here except
stay antenna which is fine but we're
going to benchmark in this resolution
here if we're gonna try 1080p if we have
to lower the in-game resolution then we
will but we'll keep the standard
resolution to 1080 because I think
that's what most people will desire this
card also the the benchmarks that you're
gonna see we're gonna have a full-on
1080 TI which is basically running with
maxed out in game settings under most
circumstances against an r5 220 and what
I want to do is see what we need to set
the in game settings to in the given
resolution to achieve roughly 60 FPS on
average we also have one percent end
point one percent lowest two to look at
so we're going to start first with GTA 5
I love using GTA 5 because it's an
all-around decent benchmark and it's
pretty well optimized as well across all
platforms so yeah let's cross our
fingers here okay so just on the on the
loading screen here it's pretty trashy
just like watching the cursor move left
and right here I think we're on like a
15 Hertz refresh rate which yeah that
that's pretty self-explanatory
resolution set by default to 800 by 600
I think we're gonna try I don't even
know if we should try 1080p in this game
I don't even think it's worth it
let's drop to 720p we are going to keep
things on let's just do the default here
it's just on normal which is pretty
bare-bones and see where we serve where
we end up here this is like a starting
point for the resin 7 1700 X in there I
think we're gonna average around
20 to 30 FPS that's what I'm thinking in
720p upscaled to 1440p on the monitor
not that it matters much so yeah I think
I think it's gonna be okay
considering the resolution but at the
same time like the only paying roughly
40 or 50 bucks for this graphics card
out of the box so yeah okay this is
pretty painful
what is this 13 14 15 FPS I totally
forgot that like the frame rate for GT
fives at the bottom as well
oh but this this isn't looking too good
I do have this game being benchmarked
off of a hard drive at 7200 rpm one
terabyte WD blue the same was benchmark
for the 1080 Ti so that's pretty even
across the board this this is this is
noticeably taking longer though I can
tell like I don't know why the graphics
card would limit things here unless it's
just straight bottleneck to you know
just before it's crapping itself and not
a below the first frame this transition
is much longer than than it was with the
attend atti yeah what's going on here I
wonder if the game just froze
I mean I'll take that as a sign okay now
we just have a black screen GTA 5 has
stopped work so the whole game just
crashed because I'm just gonna assume
because the graphics card couldn't
handle it
we got plays TV going crazy over here
Wow plays TV really all right we'll just
cancel that and I think we'll just
average that framerate out to around 14
let's just say 14 fps and that's at a
resolution that's that's literally half
of 1440p across and it's technically one
fourth of the total pixel count of 1440p
so the next game will test here let's go
let's go with something a lot lighter on
the on the graphics card let's do
counter-strike so yeah let's go and see
if we can hit 60fps and 720p with this
one because I know that a lot of
professional csgo gamers I think the
camera girl can can attest to this one
they don't care much about the in-game
you know details and stuff like that in
fact I would say that a lot of people
don't care about the resolution either
it's all about the framerate you want to
have that quick you know reaction time
and if we can hit 60fps with a $50
graphics card you know
it's not too bad offline with bots you
go to nuke map because nuke is a pretty
large map okay so we're still getting
the same trash frame right here it's
really strange this is like almost the
same 16 to 17 fps it looks like on
average this is totally unplayable I
think any pro or non pro could agree
this you can I shoot this guy yeah this
is like like my clicks my shots being
fired are delayed on this so it's I
don't even know what's going on but it's
totally not gonna work let's see if we
can drop the in-game settings even more
and work out something see we're in
1080p now so let's drop to 720p and then
we're gonna drop all of using game
settings to very low cheese's I'm
getting absolutely wrecked by bots your
smile behind the camera I really wish
people get that such a smug smile
alright this is a bit more playable
we're just easing above 30 FPS still not
recommended again and remember our
in-game settings are basically trash so
this just this just isn't this isn't
gonna work
even with csgo which I'm surprised by
this this tends to be you know a CPU
weighted game but as of now I'm seeing
the are 5 to 20 just yeah it's just it's
just not keeping up at all we're at 40
45 fps up to 50 here and I'm even know
where I'm going what am I even doing in
here oh there's a guy how many shot does
he gonna take to the chest before he
drops ok so we're gonna call csgo not
playable either plays TV I'm gonna have
to turn this off it's been so long since
I've used this yes csgo is a no-go let's
do one more game I'm just I'm just
curious we're gonna hop into cities
skylines no I I'm gonna test this one on
camera alive because I think that this
game has a chance see us csgo city
skylines is a pretty intensive game
especially when you start zooming in
uses a lot of CPU resources so I think
that this one will probably hover around
fifteen or twenty FPS which for City
skylines honestly isn't that bad with
the full-on 1080 TI 1700 X and 16 gigs
of system ram I'm averaging around 60
FPS so 20 from 60 isn't as bad I cut as
you know 140 to 15 so that's what I want
to see in this game I want to see
something like that if I don't then I'm
just gonna completely write off this
card as as ever being a possibility for
gamers to utilize wow cities is not
responding this sucks
alright so we're gonna give it another
shot here I'm just gonna reload it one
more time this is just an all-around
crap storm okay here we go
did that maybe that's tripping it we are
sporting what is this right now a solid
4 FPS totally not playable as is and I
bet if we zoom in it'll drop to like
zero
let's try yeah let's just zoom in here
three two one Oh Vietnam sitting it a
solid three okay so everything was set
to high so like I said that's probably
why it refused to run shadowdistance
very short anisotropic filtering off
anti-aliasing already disabled and
everything else is looking good we're
looking at 9 FPS this is just this is
never this is never gonna work those
buildings look so Pixley right now so
you can actually you know zoom in i
think the frame rates much more doable
than it was let's try to build some
stuff wow I'm like bankrupt right now I
can't even build anything I mean you
could technically play this game with
these settings at this framerate it's
not like me on the end of the world
especially for game like this or it's
not it's not very fast-paced you know
but it's still just a stark difference
from from a decent graphics card I mean
even with a 10 60 in here you're looking
at maybe a 10% Delta between the 10 60
and a 1080 TI just because this game
does utilize a CPU so much more so than
it does the graphics card but with the R
5 to 20 in here now it's just not it's
it's not keeping up at all we do
now have the graphics card as the
bottleneck especially for this game and
it's just cool to see how things
completely turn like the tides turn
totally when you switch from something
like this just something that's like the
size of Mount oast so with that I think
I think we're gonna go ahead and show
the other benchmarks if they're able to
be benchmarked you know the other games
and then we'll uh we'll wrap this up I
think you guys know you know where this
one's going though and I think for 50
bucks
you should look elsewhere or save a
little more money if you can and get
something that's no use maybe like an R
7 370 or older than that whether they
have HD 6950 s things that are you know
on that three or four generations older
than this because if you get something
new that's really underpowered you're
still gonna be worse off and if you got
something that was four or five years
old but that was a decent at the time
well there you have it I was really
hoping this thing would pull through at
least you know give us around 30 to 40
FPS in one of the games we tested I'm
showing you the remaining graphs now I
just not even worth discussing I was
gonna go through each one and talk about
the differences and and the in game
settings I had to use to obtain the
framerate but this thing wasn't even
pushing 30 frames in something like csgo
and the ultra lowest resolution that I
would be safely you know considering in
a video like this anyway and then also
with the lowest in game settings I was
just really disappointed with how this
thing perform now that's not to say that
the RFI of 220 should never be
considered I just don't think it should
be considered for gaming period unless
you want to go back to something as old
as like the original Sims which you know
come on is that real gaming it's
arguable I would say that's more or less
retro at this point which sounds really
weird cuz I grew up playing that game
but you're not gonna play anything
relatively modern on this in fact the
only thing I'd recommend this for is for
someone who wants to do just you know
like office work maybe have an r3 1200
you know you spent maybe 100 200 bucks
on your CPU and you don't want to go out
and get a graphics card especially in
today's market you just want to do some
office work maybe browse the web this
will let you do that I'll be it not in a
high resolution but at least it will
give you that option with the arisin
platform on intel side just use
integrated graphics you don't need
something like this I will say though
considering how affordable Rison
actually is in today's market this is
not something I would be you know a
to say you should go after if you want
something like an HTTP see with the
Rison CPU or if you want to do what I
mentioned just a second ago you know
browse the web use you know Microsoft
Word and Excel and PowerPoint this
should handle that just fine just don't
go out and buy something higher than
like a 1080p monitor because you're not
going to get those resolutions but this
unless you go DVI and even that's gonna
be a little finicky with the software
because it's also old that said it's
gonna be pretty cheap it's gonna be
pretty quiet I mean it's gonna be
virtually silent I'll think there was
much coil on at all from this card and
there is no fan it's all passively
cooled it's super thin and you can you
know just take it out and put something
else in there whenever the prices for
graphics cards actually go back down so
it's not a bad interim graphics card if
you really want to call it that but it's
not something you should be considering
for gaming period not that that's much
of a surprise I mean come on ad stream
processors now for those desperate to
get into PC gaming right now whether it
be for competitive gaming or you know
in-house gaming with friends I would say
that you could do one of two things
first off wait be patient I think these
prices are gonna go down eventually I'll
look all the miners who are buying these
cards are gonna end up selling them
eventually and I expect that the mining
market will crash to some extent soon
and people will end up cashing out
that's when you see a flood of used
graphics cards on the market especially
on sites like eBay and Craigslist so
stay tuned for that and they'll realize
I'm not gonna get their asking prices
for them the lower prices it'll take a
little bit of time but you got to be
patient for it and you'll save a lot of
money in the process or you could buy
ultra old not ultra old you know not
something like this cheap either but I
would say back to maybe two or three
generations ago so maybe gtx760 Riis and
I'm a MD side back to maybe Radeon 6900
or 7900 territory you might be able to
find some decent deals there although
AMD graphics cards because they're
better performers generally when it
comes to mining are gonna be a bit more
expensive so I would lean more towards
the Green Team for use graphics cards in
the current market with that if you have
anything else to add I'd encourage you
to comment in the comment section below
I like to read comments when I post the
video within the first hour or so just
to get a feel for how you guys are
