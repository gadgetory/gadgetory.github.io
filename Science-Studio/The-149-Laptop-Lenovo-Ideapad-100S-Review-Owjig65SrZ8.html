and lean if I told you that these words
were describing a computer could you
guess what form-factor
I really don't know why I'm asking you
this question via YouTube do ya I have
no idea why but for the record if you
answered laptop you would be correct
I've covered another laptop already on
this channel the Acer 110 which was a
two-in-one feature in Windows 10 a
touchscreen and an Intel Atom processor
now this laptop the IdeaPad 100 s from
Lenovo is nearly identical in terms of
its specifications price and target
audience but in the standard laptop
profile I'm going to be very blunt about
this laptop so first here are the pros
at only 149.99 it's definitely
budget-friendly
it features four solid physical
processing cores it features two USB
ports a full size HDMI port a micro SD
port and a microphone flash headphone
jack it features a well spaced sturdy
keyboard it features a vibrant
anti-glare screen it features a low
resolution but still existent webcam
hence the pro it features a very slim
and cool form factor in multiple colors
it features Windows 10 and often an
included here of Microsoft Office it has
a relatively long battery life about
eight to nine hours of constant moderate
use it features a 180 degree rotating
screen for flexible use ok so here are
the cons it's for physical cores are
just weak plain and simple I mean check
out our geek bench and Cinebench cores
for crying out loud the screen has a
resolution of only 1366 by 768
the trackpad is not multi-touch perhaps
the biggest letdown about this device
the camera is so poor in quality some
might argue it shouldn't even be there
the Wi-Fi driver constantly needs
resetting after leaving sleep mode it
only features 32 gigabytes roughly 27
usable gigabytes of onboard flash
storage and to top everything off it
barely plays minecraft now I might be
sounding a bit critical of this laptop
at this particular point in time but
consider the pros that I laid out
beforehand
only 150 US dollars brand-spankin'-new
you really cannot expect too much out of
this machine it does exactly what it was
intended to do and that's surf the web
and document edit basically things like
that don't really extrapolate that too
far because it really probably wouldn't
handle much of anything else
video editing is a no-go on this machine
photo editing music editing it's it's
not it's not ideal at all I would say
maybe some audio editing if you think
use things like audacity you could
probably get away with doing things like
that but anything heavy that would
involve a lot of CPU power is strongly
not recommended with this machine
including gameplay I tried playing
Minecraft on this machine and around
30fps
most of the time you go inside caves and
tunnels and things you know obviously
jump up to around 60 70 FPS but you know
explosions
even bright things like lava all that
tends to slow this computer down the
integrated HD graphics from Intel in
this case are not ideal for gameplay
this thing would struggle to even run
something like minesweeper and I am not
exaggerating when I say that so the
exciting part of this video I am on
spring break and I'm not partying
because I'm too busy but I'm here in
Florida hence the very awkward wallpaper
this is my my old bedroom and the
problem with that however is the fact
that my editing workstation is still in
Louisiana so what I am going to have to
do for the next week is edit and upload
via this idea pad 100's the only laptop
portable computer I have so everything I
do for the next week will have to be via
this laptop it's not going to go very
well I already know that but I'm going
to give it a chance and I'm going to be
sure to leave you plenty of feedback via
a few blogs vlogs I guess if there video
blogs a few of those that I'll be
uploading to the channel as well to let
you know how my experience has been
faring out with this machine like I said
it's not recommended that you video edit
or photo edit or anything like that but
for the sake of pretty interesting
videos I'm going to do all of that
because this is science to do and you
gotta try some cool stuff out every now
and then right yeah it's not going to be
fun but anyway if I had to sum up a
single target audience for this
particular laptop I would say that it
would have to be a college student on
budget I think that this this fits down
that alley perfect up that alley down
that alley I don't know perfectly so if
you only are looking to spend maybe 150
200 bucks on a laptop and all you plan
to do is take notes or surf the web
consider the idea of had 100's remember
I'm not getting paid for these reviews I
bought this thing completely on my own
with the science studio budget I don't
get free anything from anyone so these
reviews are entirely my own and are not
being you know solicited or paid for by
anybody so take my word for it check it
out for yourself if you are interested
you know I'm sure they may have these on
display and Best Buy and other places so
you can check them out before you buy
them but I don't believe you'll be
disappointed with how much or how little
money you'll be spending on this product
if you like this review be sure to give
it a thumbs up if you disliked it for
whatever reason give it a thumbs down
and let me know why in the comments
below be sure to leave other comments as
well let me know what you think about
the computer and the price point
subscribe if you have not already and
stay tuned for these vlogs and other
videos that we release that we will be
releasing very soon
this is science studio thanks for
