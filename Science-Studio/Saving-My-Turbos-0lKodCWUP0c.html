video a bit of change of pace don't
worry this is not gonna quickly become a
car channel just something that I wanted
to do on the side and film document I
just think it's a fun process getting to
work on my cars and right here I have
two HKS blow-off valves we're gonna be
installing these in an effort to save my
turbos in the long term so first off
this is an air to water intercooler
setup and see we have two of these air
to water intercoolers and that charged
air mix to the throttle bodies into the
intake manifold and this is a v6 here so
twin turbo v6 produces stock this is a
red sports about 400 horsepower about
350 to the wheels and with what I've
done to it so far jb4 I've got down
pipes and axle back exhaust sound we're
gonna change much cold air intake system
which is kind of a joke it's not really
cold air intake system but you get that
little woosh effect not likely to change
horsepower much at all I expect I'm
probably pushing somewhere close to 400
at the wheels and torque is pretty high
now thanks to the J before setup I'm
probably somewhere around 425 pound feet
of torque which is impressive for a
small little v6 like this now quick
summary of how the intake system works
the cold air intakes are up front kind
of pushes air in through the grille and
then that error is tunneled down past
the MAF sensor into the turbo inlet now
the turbo is tied directly to the
exhaust manifold so it's pressed right
against the block and of course that
turns the opposite side of the turbo
creates that suction and that's what
pulls more in that's why it's called
forced induction now that charged air
right heats up it's I mean we're using
exhaust basically exhaust gases exhaust
output from the engine to turn the turbo
but the air that comes in from the front
that's pulled in gets forced through the
turbo spins really fast heats up that's
boost pressure building then it gets
thrown into the intercooler the
intercooler is an air to water setup
which means that you know normally if
you look at the some older school
Japanese cars they're gonna have air to
air intake setups and you'll see an
intercooler down here and that's just a
narrative intercooler setup so as you
move the air moves through the
intercooler thing but like a radiator
right it's gonna cool down that charge
air well up top we've got the water
setup here and there are pros and cons
to this upfront it's gonna do a great
job but these things heat soak fairly
quick
that's a downside of going with an air
to water setup like this but do you have
to separate throttle bodies too to
separate intercoolers but anyway this
cools down the air that's charged by the
turbo forced in through the throttle
body intake manifold and then into the
engine the problem with this setup is
that when you let off the throttle under
high boost let's say you rev to 6000 rpm
and you shift twice or let's say you
just let off the throttle right or you
break because you're in the city where
does that boost pressure go some cars
mitigate it with blow-off valve some
cars have recirculation systems this car
has neither which means that the boost
pressure gets pushed backwards through
the entire system and that is not good
for the turbo that's counteracting the
natural spin the natural tendency of the
turbos on each side so the solution is
to install in this case HKS blow off any
blow-off valve kit will work I'm going
with HKS ESS qvs are very highly
regarded in the industry and that's why
it shows them also I appreciate the
prompt shipping from z1 motorsports so
they're gonna go basically right here
we're gonna insert like a t silicone
little piping set here and so that way
when air gets pushed backwards the way
it shouldn't be going through the
intercooler backwards and then where the
turbo would be which is further down
there we're gonna have a little T
Junction and that excess boost pressure
can be cycled into the atmosphere
through a blow-off valve and I'll show
you what those look like in a second so
we're gonna insert the tee a little tee
neck here and then we're also going to
install the blow-off valves on each side
you can see on this side we've also got
this pipe here and the intercooler up
top so that charged air going backwards
it's gonna have a place to vent to
atmosphere instead of going further down
backwards through the turbos now this
here is what one of the SS QV blow-off
valves looks like from HKS and you can
see it's got the authentic stud sticker
up top looking mighty fun if I do say so
myself the reason why these things are
so bulky the reason why integrity
matters for these is because let's say
this gets stuck open right if it's in
the open position then all your boost
pressure vents to atmosphere there's
less resistance that way than going
backwards to a compressor or into a
compressor or intake system and so
you're gonna lose boost when you don't
want to lose boost and then if this
valve gets stuck closed then you're
effectively undoing what this was
supposed to do in the first place and
you're not going to have that boost
recirculates gonna get forced backwards
through the intake system so yeah it's
important that these things work
terming see some of the inner workings
there but in general that's why these
exist right so you want these to open
and close the way they're designed to so
that you vent atmosphere when you want
to when you when the car needs to do so
so yeah we're gonna start installing
right now
so that is that I wanted to give you a
clip of what the blow fell sound like
when install didn't want to do this at
my apartment complex because the car is
just a bit loud I do apologise for the
wind out here but they want a blue ball
you wanted to at least show you what
they sound like and it definitely gives
it that JDM kind of ricey sound it's not
going to be for everybody honestly I
didn't do it for the sound at all there
are some little nozzles you could put in
these blah valves to make the ejection
of air sound even higher pitched I'm not
really into that it's this more or less
again just to save the turbos in the
long run because Infiniti decided to
ignore the fact that people would
probably be boosting these cars a bit
more than stock so with that view guys
like the video a change of pace it's not
gonna be the norm don't worry I'm gonna
give this one a thumbs up I appreciate
it I am on my way to Europe here soon to
see Lisa and then we will be actually
from Germany going to Spain for a couple
of days so maybe we'll find like a tech
market in Barcelona to film a video
we'll see how that goes you guys are
awesome thanks for watching this is
