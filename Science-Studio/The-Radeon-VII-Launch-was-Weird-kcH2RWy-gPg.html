let me get this straight we seen a be
hyped for months leading up to CES not
that we expected anything we launched at
CES regarding that architecture but then
all of a sudden we get Vega to SPC games
and right so this is the second
generation of AMD's Vega graphics
architecture hence the v2 for Vega 2
though because it's the first seven
enemy to gaming GPU it's also Radeon
seven
damn this AMD Radeon seven is just
layers upon layers of clever but is the
launch itself clever especially in light
of conflicting reports that the cards
will ship in limited production we'll
try our best to break down the facts and
claims made by many on the web and
forecast the enthusiast graphics card
market with AMD now hopefully in the
picture privacy calm is the easy way to
shop securely online by creating virtual
debit cards tied securely to your bank
account you can even download the
browser extension and let it autofill
card information with a single click get
started for free and on a $5 credit by
clicking the link below today so when
you think of right on 7 the first thing
you probably imagine is the 7 animated
fat this is the work of TSMC and this is
indeed the world's first 7 nanometre
gaming GPU technically speaking but it
isn't the world's first 7 nanometre GPU
AMD m150 came before more server
oriented and some phones like the iPhone
10s are already sporting 7 nanometer
CPUs but they do the stuff in-house
separate issue but remember a lot of
what we hear in terms of lithography at
this point is marketing hype 7
nanometers would have had a specific
meaning say like in the early 2000s but
today the length denotes more or less a
generation rather than any physical
aspect of the dye itself so just what is
7 nanometer Vega
well AMD calls it Vega 2 still
technically GC + 5 architecture just on
a smaller denser scale slightly fewer
chorus slightly higher clocks and double
the memory bandwidth and capacity TDP is
about on par with Vega 64 as well it's
around 300 watts and that explains a
dual a pin supplemental power connectors
we expect this card to pull around its
TDP figure from the wall at stock which
I mean let's be honest that's less
efficient in its current state than
Pascal or touring offerings though not
expect it to be a deal-breaker for most
remembered
Navi so we shouldn't be too surprised by
these numbers this is again based on the
exact same Vega architecture you can't
also take all of AMD's in-house
benchmarks by the way with a handful of
salt just to get this out there seeing
is the other numbers have been known to
vastly miss the mark in terms of how
accurate they've been anyone remember
these B reacts figures so what rate on
seven ultimately looks like is at least
in my opinion are refreshed
that's literally what we're looking at
here folks all in all I'm expecting
between maybe and twenty and thirty
percent performance buff on average
that's pretty good for a refresh but
remember we have the fab to thank for
that AMD was more forthcoming with
performance metrics and NVIDIA this time
around showing their card outperforming
the RDX twenty eighty in a few choice
games including battlefield five who is
frostbite engine has old ties to AMD so
no surprise there really I to be just as
critical here as I was with Nvidia in
this video that when Vidya gave us
significantly less to work with so while
I'm still skeptical of in-house numbers
I should say extremely skeptical at
least it's something by the way one of
the biggest advantages of the new fab is
space of course whereas Vegas 64 s
package comprise nearly 500 square
millimeters the new Vega die consumes
just 331 square millimetres of space
this makes room for an additional two
HBM two stacks which is why we're able
to fit 16 gigabytes in total here as for
the rumors regarding limited supply AMD
has swiftly intervened and stated on the
record that demand from gamers will be
met this would be a wonderful contrast
to the original Vega launch I do say so
myself
AI bees are also expected to be included
on launch day that's February 7 though I
haven't confirmed this with any IAB yet
so I'll let you know if we hear anything
from them it all really just comes down
to how heavy short-term demand is for
these cards and at 699 bucks I honestly
don't expect it to be anything crazy
people waiting for this card
specifically might buy into it now but
my guess is that a lot of people are
going to wait for na'vi
because we expect na'vi will be more
budget-conscious a majority of gamers
are not spending money on graphics cards
over about 300 bucks we see that in
steam surveys a lot of people are
actually using two three general
graphics cards so I just don't see a lot
of people going out and paying seven
eight hundred bucks for these cards we
rented they did for the RT X lineup so
who knows
speaking of which to the RT X 2080 which
this card purported
tres blows with is currently going for
anywhere between seven and nine hundred
USD in my opinion at that price point
both cards are a bit expensive and
without ray-tracing capabilities the
r-tx 2088 700 bucks which gigabyte is
currently selling one of their models
for appears to be the better buy but
we'll have to see how all this plays out
when samples reach the media and
independent benchmarks are published for
now many of us are still waiting for
Navi as I said and that's because we
expected to replace the current lineup
of Oryx graphics cards like the 575
eighty and 590 meaning they should be
significantly cheaper than what we're
seeing here from the raid on 7 we expect
GDD our 6 will be used in place of HBM
to reduce overhead we expect double the
logic density of the RX 580 similar
efficiency levels and up to 40%
performance boost per family of course
that's our hope but I do strongly
believe we'll see something similar to
the transition between Maxwell and
Pascal with AMD this time around which
would be phenomenal I still remember
Pasco cards were epic at launch and I
was I was so amped for those cards
because in large part they were really
affordable they were efficient and the
performance improvements were staggering
for the price so if AMD can pull off
something similar we'll have an
extremely large void filled with
invidious 50 series cards still out of
play and the 2060 out pricing its own
predecessor by over a hundred bucks and
look I expect AMD to be perfectly
comfortable with with the budget gaming
space we saw this with the RX 4 and 5
Series cards anywhere between 1 and $300
seems to be the sweet spot for a
majority of gamers Vega 56 and 64
launches were obscure and disappointing
initially and only recently have we been
able to fully appreciate the
competitiveness of such a platform but
my guess is that Navi sticks with the
affordable sweet spot and under cuts and
videos push for premium products and
ray-tracing capabilities that's not to
say that na'vi will avoid ray-tracing
altogether I just don't think they're
gonna put as much of an emphasis on it
as Nvidia has this year AMD's Lisa sue
stated earlier last year that r8
Racing's relevance and the market is
limited to its affordability and degree
of adoption what that tells me is that
AMD will likely hold off on implementing
its own rate racing technology until it
becomes more affordable and mainstream
which from the looks of things won't be
anytime soon like the X R and D LSS
while they might look good in game are
still widely in development
likely thanks to ongoing performance
optimizations DX our hitch graphics
cards hard even our TX cards and until
this and other characteristics of the
technology are addressed I'd put money
on AMD staying out of this game
especially with respect to their lower
tier cards which we think much of Navi
will fall into so what do you think
about rhytm 7 in the future of Navi let
me know in the comments below I'm
actually curious to see what you guys
have to say about this I'm you know I'm
gonna be critical either way look
AMD doesn't pay me anything Nvidia
doesn't pay me anything I just call it
like I see it I think in videos launch
was significantly more shady that
straight up I still think that's the
case I do think though that AMD is
trying to fill a void rather quickly and
that's why they're taking their m1 50s
and kind of rebranding them and
targeting them toward gamers and maybe
they're having issues selling those
cards in the server space because well
AI space any of that stuff any
commercial-grade venture just because
our TX cards are doing so well in that
market right when you have dedicated
arty tensor AI cores there they're going
to do their job very well because that's
what they're there for
but the m150 doesn't really have that
technology on board yet and maybe that's
one of the reasons why they're kind of
just pushing supply into the gaming
space we'll see but I'm still a bit
confused and I think until navi rolls
out we roll we just won't really know
the full picture so yeah kind of off the
cuff there that's my closing argument
what do you guys think thumbs up thumbs
down you know what to do click that red
subscribe button and I'll catch you in
the next video this is sorry in studio
