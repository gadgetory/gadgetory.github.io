special about being able to potentially
pack so much computational power into
such a small volume we're talking not
much larger than an Xbox 1x console
which is about as big as you'd ever want
to take anything with you right if it's
any bigger than that it's an
inconvenience to carried in your
backpack assuming you can even fit it in
there if it's larger and then bring it
with you it's like a check-in bag or
carry-on you got to worry about people
throwing stuff if you have to ship it
with ups trust me don't do that so the
idea of an ultra portable PC is really
entertaining to me my goal is to be able
to take this PC with me to Computex in
Taiwan in June and edit on this rig
using like the hotel TV or whatever
we're gonna have at our disposal there
I'll bring a mouse in keyboard and boom
we're good to go because trust me
editing on a macbook it's much better
than editing on like a Dell XPS 13 but
it still has its severe limitations so
what I'm gonna show you in this video is
the sweet tech porn the b-roll the
construction of this PC and then
afterwards we're gonna talk about what I
plan to do in part 2 to make this PC
even more unique than it probably
already is if someone else already has
this exact build out there dang it I'm
sure many of you have like similar
builds but the custom sleeve cables I
think or just like the icing on the cake
here the scythe cooler looks sweet and I
think that just all of this kind of came
together so perfectly and beautifully in
the fractal design node - OH - then I'm
excited for part two so I'll stop
rambling here is the build log
now run off the top I want to discuss a
few things you might be wondering about
the build first off the CPU cooler has
literally perfect clearance so this is
like a textbook definition of perfect
when it comes to just the idea of two
different components that don't you know
that aren't manufactured by the same
company working together so beautifully
so the the cooler itself actually
touches the bottom of the dust filter on
the top panel of the Franklin Oh - OH -
at first I was kind of disappointed
there but it's not actually touching the
fins of the fan because those are
slightly recessed inside the fans frame
so this is perfect I don't mind it
touching the the frame you know it's not
like I have to force the top cover on
there it is a textbook fit and I would
recommend this this cooler in particular
to anyone looking to build in the
fractal design note 202 something else
I'm disappointed in myself for because I
didn't plan far enough ahead and think
about this in advance was the the fact
that there is no 1070 TI for the wind -
card in this build even though it's
linked down below I recommend you get
that thing over a Founders Edition car
like this because I think the price is
starting to come down now you usually
can get like a package deal with an EVGA
card so you can check those out below
and I was really glad that Jakob was
able to send one of these cards out to
slot 1070 TI for the win - the problem
is though it requires to 8-pin VGA
cables and I only had one 8 pin and one
6 pin made in the cable mod configurator
so that was my fault I didn't realize
that the card required to a pin so I was
stuck with just 1/8 and 1/6 and that
meant that I had to use the founders
vision 1070 that I purchased myself from
Best Buy a while back so it doesn't fill
the entire like graphics card
compartment of the node - OH - the 1070
TI for the 1/2 would have that's the
only thing I wish I could still change
at this point in time another thing I'm
sure he of you're wondering is why I
only chose a 250 gig em to SSD this is a
Samsung 860 Drive and it's a pretty
sweet one for what it is but it's pretty
small as well right most people would
prefer at least a 500 like a half
terabyte to a terabyte with the storage
is pretty mainstream nowadays if you're
gonna go with only an SSD and not
something like a hard drive to
complement your storage space I was just
actually a little impatient I didn't
want to wait for the 500 gig drive
coming from a data
that's gonna be here Saturday but this
build I was just I wanted to put it
together he was so excited to see how it
would turn out so I'm gonna head in
through the 860 Evo which is what I had
on hand into the rig and if I need to
upgrade later not a big deal
lastly I want to mention the icing on
the cake the Corsair SF 600 fully
modular sfx power supply paired with
cable mod cables these are custom sleeve
pro cables i got them in all silver
because i figured it would match the
accents on both the graphics card as
well as our a suzie 170 i ITX
motherboard which is a great board by
the way you can find all these parts
linked down below if you want to build
something similar for yourself but the
cables you know you might be wondering
why I chose custom sleep cables in a
build that you can't see inside of and
that has to do with part 2 which is
coming soon I'm not gonna say too much
about it but I think you'll really enjoy
the case mod we're gonna conduct here
the other thing though is the power
supply you got to have her I'm fully
monitoring the power supply if you want
to use these cables because if you're
gonna use extensions you might not have
the space to use extensions in a case
like the node - OH - it's pretty
restrictive even using like the stock
power supply that came with a node 202
it's gonna have a bit of like cable
mumbo-jumbo because it's just there's
not enough space in there right
so having custom length custom sleeve
cables was a priority for me in this
build and I think I got everything
almost perfect I just kind of eyeballed
stuff is like yeah it's like you have
200 millimeters that seems like enough
for this one and this cable might need
300 millimeters now it's kind of just
eyeballing it and it actually worked out
pretty well I didn't have any excess
cabling anywhere but anyway for
interested in putting together cables
like I did you can check out cable much
configurator linked in the video
description and you can either design
some sleeving extensions which are good
for power supplies that don't have
modular support or you can have cables
that plug directly into your power
supply as long as it's supported on the
configurator a website huge thanks to
cable Mon for putting the icing on the
cake with this one these cables are just
perfect and the idea of like you know
specifying the lengths of cables it was
so good for a build like this because
there again there's not much space in
this case for excess cabling but anyway
everyone I hope you guys enjoyed at
least watching the tech porn if not me
talking I totally get it I'm not
offended and I had a lot of fun building
this one because again it was a
challenge in a sense that it was really
you know compact but at the same time I
think it pays off because it there's
just no wasted space in here and I
wait for part two stay tuned for that
it's not already the card above that's
because I'm still working on it
as of filming this of course I'm still
working out of it I think it's really
gonna pay off so stick around for that
give us one a thumbs up if you thought
it was cool thumbs down for the opposite
you can be critical in the comments it's
totally fine and I stay tuned for the
next one this is science studio thanks
for building with us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
