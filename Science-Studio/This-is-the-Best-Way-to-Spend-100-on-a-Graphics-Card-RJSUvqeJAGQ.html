mi a recently that's because I am in the
process of moving and seeing is on
basically a one-man show at this point
with Lisa still in Germany I've been
pretty slow with respect to getting my
stuff to the new apartment I'm moving
officially tomorrow I'm getting a moving
truck and my family's gonna help me out
a little bit so this stuff behind me
this is pretty much all of science to do
his inventory you can't see most of it
below me on the ground that'll all be
taken over there tomorrow including all
my just general living furniture couches
beds all that good stuff
so bear with me there's a weird backdrop
very weird setting I still wanted to
make this video it's been a while since
I've uploaded one and I think it's a hot
one you guys are gonna like this budget
oriented mind so that I have the
approach I'm going to take to this video
because if you're comfortable buying
used I think there's a really good
option on the market many people seem to
be overlooking because this is a
two-generation old car I'm gonna
recommend but it'll still pack a huge
punch in 1080p and even some light 1440p
so if you want to play fortnight or pub
G but you want to do it on a solid
budget then this card might be for you
stay tuned this video is brought to you
by PDF element your one-stop PDF viewer
and editor with it you can annotate and
convert Word and PDF files take notes in
an e-text book for class and sign
important documents it's actually an
affordable and viable alternative to
corporate competition you guys aren't
I'm talking about and you can pick it up
now for your favorite operating system
it's very easy to use you won't regret
the switch you can start a free trial
download for free on mobile or buy
outright with a 40 percent coupon baked
in to the very top link in this video's
description I'll give you guys a few
seconds to click on it you can pause the
video it's okay I'll wait click yet so
okay enough with the suspense what card
am I talking about its the EVGA GTX 970
now any 970 will do this one is a for
the win card which I'm pretty sure means
it's using a custom PCB better for
higher power tolerances sustaining
higher overclocks in general if I'm
wrong I'll put something right here but
even if this was a reference 970 board
it's something you should consider not
only because it probably missed the
mining bullet most people weren't buying
970 s to mind with these cards were
owned by people
from five six years ago but also because
I got this particular card on eBay for a
hundred bucks $100 even was all I paid
for this and I think it's gonna provide
a great value alternative for those
looking for around gtx 1060 territory
but who don't want to spend two or three
hundred bucks because 10 60's are still
pretty expensive right now so when you
see this card a benchmark and compared
with other cards in today's video know
that i'm using this exact for the windbg
a card for those tests again keep in the
back of your mind that it's only a
hundred bucks and it is you so you might
need to clean it you might need to swap
the thermal paste that's on there for
something a little more up-to-date it
can get pretty crusty under there but in
general I mean as long as the card works
out of the box yeah you did good
right you did why the toss-up as to
whether or not the card works to begin
with is the gamble that people play when
they buy used components on eBay but if
the card works out of the box I'd say
you're gonna be good for the next at
least two or three years cards aren't
just gonna randomly die for the most
part unless you're doing some really
weird stuff with your system now I
didn't clean this card beforehand I
actually ran all my tests with the dust
and everything else is baked in here and
I just did that because I assumed that
most of you weren't gonna clean these
cards I had most people tend to be on
the lazy side when they buy something
even if it's used they just want it to
work out of the box and that's it
they're not gonna take this thing apart
swap the thermal paste you know unless
you're someone who really cares about
his or her hardware which I respect most
people honestly aren't gonna do that so
if there was any thermal limitation
associated with the dust in this card
there's quite a bit of it in here it
will be exhibited in these benchmarks
and you can see we use the exact same
test bench we did for the last two or
three benchmark videos here on the
channel now I know that Nvidia just
released the the newest official driver
for Turing and Pascal cards whatnot
I used the latest driver capable of
supporting the 970 and compare that with
the results of the previous driver for
the 1070 the 1070 TI and the 1080 that
we tested in previous videos so you will
see those cards compared to this well
not because I want this to look bad but
because I want you to know what you're
missing by choosing to forego at two or
three hundred dollar used card and
instead gone with something that only
costs one hundred US dollars and if you
were buying used in the first place I'm
going to assume that you are somebody
who values value
that didn't come out right and you can
see in our 3dmark fire strike results
that our GTX 970 actually comes pretty
close to outperforming our GTX 1060 in
1080p this is a six gig 1060 I'm really
impressed here and again for only a
hundred bucks that's less than half the
price of a new 6k 1060 in most markets
this is a really great value proposition
let's see if it extends into some of our
games starting out first with GTA 5 the
970 is again just barely losing to the
1060 in 1080p we are maxing out most of
the settings here so that's why the
framerate seemed a little low and in
1440p a similar story
I wouldn't recommend a 970 for 4k gaming
especially in GTA 5 you're just gonna
have frame rates that typically did well
below 60 at medium to high settings
up next is witcher 3 our resource hog
graphically intensive game you guys know
by this point I love using witcher 3
because it's straight up just a graphics
card battle here the cpu for the most
parts gonna be ok even if you have just
a 4 core cpu or even a dual core hyper
threaded cpu like an old-school AI 3
you're gonna be typically fine on the
CPU side if your clocks are decent the
graphics card will almost always be the
bottleneck if you're willing to bump up
those in game settings we're in the
ultra preset here with no hair works and
again the 970 is just barely losing to
the gtx 1060 actually about a 6 to 7
frame difference here meaning the 970 is
significantly better from a value
perspective now i'm going to breeze
through these last few benchmarks and
that's really because the story is
basically the same even in pub g which
is a relatively new game the 1060 does
just a little bit better than it does
with respect to the other tests but
again this is a disparity I'm willing to
take when seen in the context of how
much I paid for the for the wind GTX 970
we see a couple other games here where
the gap narrows and this of course is
something that favors a 970 even more so
because if this card can keep up with
the GTX 1060 yet remain less than half
the price of a 1060 the only risk you
really incurring here is the used aspect
of the card now
I do want to talk about a few other
quirks with this one I'm I'm pretty sure
this is the first time I've ever seen
dual 6 pin power connectors and the
reason why they have dual 6 pin is
because the the power requirements for
this
specific board here meet the standards
of two six pins versus a single eight
pin or an eight pin plus a 6 pin so it's
gonna look a little weird having two six
pins running into this card for
supplemental power but again that's the
price you pay for a GTX 970 nowadays
again that's just something I'm not used
to also this one came with a backplate
and I think this was standard on for the
wind cards but for other GTX 970 s it
was not you could actually buy the
backplate separately for like 30 or 40
bucks from new Ike I know I did that one
time for a 970 but this one came with
one so it's a nice touch keeps the card
looking clean and basically any rig and
lastly with respect to noise how loud is
this card run something else you're
probably worried about because again
it's an older card
Maxwell wasn't as power efficient as
Pascal that was one of the big
advantages of Pascal was you can get
980ti performance right at 1070
but the 1070 consumes significantly less
power had a much lower TDP that was a
big improvement over the Maxwell stuff
but this card really didn't get that hot
it got to about 70 I want to say 73
degrees Celsius off the top of my head
that was something I didn't create a
graph for but 73 C is perfectly fine for
a card like this and it was actually a
quieter card than our GTX 1060 now the
coolers are not the same this isn't an
apples-to-apples comparison but I do
want you to understand that this card is
not going to be extremely loud that's
really what I want you to take away from
this it's not a very loud card at all
despite being based on two generation
old architecture it's still great you
have not three DisplayPort outs in just
a single DisplayPort out so running
three DisplayPort monitors from this
card is going to be very difficult in
the soup daisy chain and even then I'm
not sure if it would work I'd love to
research that a little more
we have dvi-i we have DB ID and then we
have an HDMI port as well so again this
is the older gents tough this is why it
looks a little strange but it's
something you have to consider when
buying an older card because this again
will not support three DisplayPort outs
natively so that's about it for this one
folks again I apologize for the weird
setting I am in the process of moving
and it will be finished very soon I
wanna give a shout out again to PDF
element for sponsoring this video and I
want to hear from you guys especially in
the comment section below with respect
to this card what do you guys think
about a GTX 970 in 2018 or 2019 we're
pretty
close to that Morgan it's kind of crazy
to think about the gtx970 is something I
would consider
especially in maybe a four to five
hundred dollar rig I'm actually gonna
put together a system you know revolving
around a budget of about four to five
hundred bucks and I'm going to use this
card because if that was my budget
constraint I would by use first off I
would take the risk because you just get
so much more value assuming the card
works and if it doesn't usually the eBay
buyer protection guarantee coverage you
but 100 bucks for this kind of
performance is incredible in 2018
especially coming off of the mining
craze one carts were extremely expensive
the used market is lit right now and
that's why so many my videos have been
curtailed towards the used market now I
also have I believe it's an Rx 570
coming in and I'll let you know how that
testing goes very soon so one more use
graphics card video in the future I'm
not sure if I'll do that back-to-back
with this one but I'm also we're going
to be testing a used AMD card just so
that we're kind of incorporating both
companies here
the Nvidia markets a little more hot I
think because there were more cards
owned I mean just look at steam surveys
and video cards are by far more popular
with lighting how many people are using
them but I want to make sure that I test
AMD to you know they deserve to be
included because the RX 5 70s 5 80s for
seventies for 80s even the 4 gig for
seventies and for 80s are still viable
options in 2018 if you want to spend
around 100 to 120 bucks so stay tuned
for that again leave a comment down
