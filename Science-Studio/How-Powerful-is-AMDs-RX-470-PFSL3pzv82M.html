polaris trumpet and it was about time a
card from the red team that appeared
competitive not by itself but when Kross
fired as 2rx for abs and crossfire will
likely compete with a single gtx 1070
and at around the same price point if
you haven't yet seen my coverage of the
forehead you can check it out in the
card above me AMD's told me they're
sending one to the studio so I expect to
be able to put that thing head-to-head
against this r9 390 lurking in the rig
behind me however for those still
rocking those 1080p monitors I mean even
I do this one's a 1080p ultra wide and
our X 480 might be a bit overboard but
what about those of us looking for more
relaxed let's take things a little
slower graphics cards well AMD has two
solutions for you the RX 470 and the RX
460 this video is covering the 470 but
if you're interested in the 460 you can
check it out in more detail in the card
above me so what's with this leaked info
first off I should disclose the fact
that these these data that you're about
to see are not to confirm they could be
completely made-up these people might
just be making up these these results
just for the sake of attention and if
that's the case shame on them but for
the sake of this video we will rely on
this data because this at this point is
all we have to go off of the source of
these benchmarks is tweakers a dutch
technology website they claimed AMD as
quote-unquote released the benchmarks
you're about to see but I'll let you be
the judge of that
Andy themselves haven't said much in
regards to either the 470 or the 460
save a few lines of hype and a fancy
debut of the cards design and then we
have two other cards here which are
pretty exciting as well we have the RX
470 and the RX 460 the 470 is really
focused on excellent performance per
watt
so it's 2.8 x over the previous
generation and you get full HD
experiences 1080p you running 60 frames
per second gorgeous card will have many
many different versions of this from our
adding board partners and then we have
the 460 which is really focused on
eSports so I heard about all those
eSports fans in the audience this guy is
going to be the best card in the
industry less than 75 watts cool fast I
think you're going to love these cards
so we're really excited about our new
technology here without further ado here
are the purported benchmark
okay so let's discuss what we just saw
VR explore 70 is by no means a
powerhouse and it was never meant to be
however what we can discern from these
graphs is that the 470 is a much better
performer obviously then it's 270 X and
370 counterparts starting with fire
strike the 470 received a score that was
just over 57 percent higher than the
270x
at 9090 versus 5700 87 this also places
the rx 470 above the r9 380 and 380 X
and just under the 390 at 10,000 420 oh
and did I mention at a price tag
substantially lower than all of them in
games hitman ashes of the singularity
and overwatch the 470 wipe the floor
with the 270x Yuting significantly
higher frame rates across the board all
of this while maintaining a much smaller
thermal footprint at 110 watts TDP
versus the 270 X's 180 it makes sense
now why the 470 reference card only
features a single 6 pin power connector
impressive performance and efficiency
from AMD's Polaris 10 GPU now at first
at least from my personal point of view
the 470 appeared to be a distant child
of the 4 80s longing for the attention
that the 40 will likely receive thanks
to its competitive price point and
performance however things change for me
today after looking at these benchmarks
assuming that they're relatively
accurate here's what sealed the deal for
me the RX 470 specifications and all
honesty aren't far off on the 480 s
either so it makes sense
I made accurate predictions about the
480 St flop value right at 5.5 and I
expect right under 5 teraflops of
floating-point performance for the 470
I'll say 4.8 for now memory bandwidth is
also slightly diminished at 224 gigabits
per second although it's unlikely you'll
ever notice this gameplay now as for
price WC CF tech and others are
expecting the 470 to retail for around
150 US dollars about the same price as a
current r7 370 the 470 s older sibling
at this price point and level of
performance we're looking at double the
performance of the r7 370 for the exact
same price 1.8 3 times the performance
to be exact the same can be said in
terms of the r9 270x as well I predict a
great deal of competition from the red
team this year as well as the next now
fans of the green I hear you either of
invidious current flag ships would blow
these from AMD out of the water but Amy
hasn't released their top tier card yet
either
don't be so quick to judge just yet if
you like what you've seen in this video
give it a thumbs up give it
doesn't feel the complete opposite or if
you hate everything about life be sure
to clear a penny have it already stay
tuned for future AMD build here on the
channel it's design studio thanks for
learning with us
